TI  - The in vitro antimicrobial activity of Cymbopogon essential oil (lemon grass) and its interaction with silver ions.
AB  - BACKGROUND: It is well known that Cymbopogon (lemon grass) essential oil exhibits antimicrobial activity while the efficacy of silver ions as a disinfectant is equally well reported. HYPOTHESIS: The antimicrobial activity of CEO and Ag(+) and their synergistic combinations will be useful in improving the current treatment strategies for various infections. STUDY DESIGN: In the present study, we determined the chemical composition and in vitro antimicrobial activity of six different Cymbopogon essential oils (CEO's) alone and in combination with silver ions (Ag(+)) against two Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis), two Gram-negative (Escherichia coli and Moraxella catarrhalis) and two yeast species (Candida albicans and Candida tropicalis). The nature of potential interactions was determined by fractional inhibitory concentration indices (FICIs) for CEO's and Ag(+) calculated from microdilution assays and time-kill curves. RESULTS: Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry results confirmed the presence of nerol, geranial and geraniol as major volatile compounds. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values confirmed that all the tested pathogens are variably susceptible to both CEO's as well as Ag(+). The MIC of CEO's and Ag(+) against all the tested pathogens ranged from 0.032 mg/ml to 1 mg/ml and 0.004 and 0.064 mg/ml respectively, whereas when assayed in combination the FICI values were drastically reduced to range between 0.258 and 2.186, indicating synergy, additive and indifferent interactions. The most prominent interaction was observed between Cymbopogon flexuosus essential oil and Ag(+) against C. albicans with summation operatorFIC = 0.254. The synergistic interactions were further confirmed through the construction of isobolograms and time-kill plots. Transmission electron microscopy showed disturbance in the cell envelope upon the concomitant treatment of CEO's and Ag(+), which ultimately leads to cell death. CONCLUSION: Results suggest that CEO's and Ag(+) when used in combination offers an opportunity to the formulation scientist to produce novel combinations acting synergistically in the continued quest to control important infectious pathogens.
TI  - Surfaces Presenting alpha-Phenyl Mannoside Derivatives Enable Formation of Stable, High Coverage, Non-pathogenic Biofilms against Pathogen Colonization.
AB  - Prevention of pathogenic colonization on medical devices over a long period of time remains a great challenge, especially in a high-nutrient environment that accelerates production of biomass leading to biofouling of the device. Since biofouling and the subsequent pathogen colonization is eventually inevitable, a new strategy using non-pathogenic bacteria as living guards against pathogenic colonization on medical devices has attracted increasing interest. Crucial to the success of this strategy is to pre-establish a high coverage and stable biofilm of benign bacteria on the surface. Silicone elastomers are one of the most widely used materials in biomedical devices. In this work, we modified silicone surfaces to promote formation of high coverage and stable biofilms by a non-pathogenic Escherichia coli strain 83972 with type 1 fimbriae (fim+) to interfere the colonization of an aggressive biofilm-forming, uropathogenic Enterococcus faecalis. Although it is well known that mannoside surfaces promote the initial adherence of fim+ E. coli through binding to the FimH receptor at the tip of the type 1 fimbriae, it is not clear whether the fast initial adherence could lead to a high coverage and stable protective biofilm. To explore the role of mannoside ligands, we synthesized a series of alkyl and aryl mannosides varied in structure and immobilized them on silicone surfaces pre-coated with poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimer. We found that stable and densely packed benign E. coli biofilms were formed on the surfaces presenting biphenyl mannoside with the highest initial adherence of fim+ E. coli. These non-pathogenic biofilms prevented the colonization of E. faecalis for 11 days at a high concentration (108 CFU mL-1, 100,000 times above the diagnostic threshold for urinary tract infection) in the nutrient-rich Lysogeny Broth (LB) media. The result shows a correlation among the initial adherence of fim+ E. coli 83972, the coverage and long-term stability of the resultant biofilms, as well as their efficiency for preventing the pathogen colonization.
TI  - Statins and Antimicrobial Effects: Simvastatin as a Potential Drug against Staphylococcus aureus Biofilm.
AB  - Statins are important lipid-lowering agents with other pleiotropic effects. Several studies have explored a possible protective effect of statins to reduce the morbidity and mortality of many infectious diseases. Staphylococcus aureus is one of the main pathogens implicated in nosocomial infections; its ability to form biofilms makes treatment difficult. The present study observed the MIC of atorvastatin, pravastatin and simvastatin against S. aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis. Simvastatin was the only agent with activity against clinical isolates and reference strains of methicilin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Thus, the effects of simvastatin on the growth, viability and biofilm formation of S. aureus were tested. In addition, a possible synergistic effect between simvastatin and vancomycin was evaluated. Simvastatin's MIC was 15.65 microg/mL for S. aureus 29213 and 31.25 microg/mL for the other strains of S. aureus. The effect of simvastatin was bactericidal at 4xMIC and bacteriostatic at the MIC concentration. No synergistic effect was found between simvastatin and vancomycin. However, the results obtained against S. aureus biofilms showed that, in addition to inhibiting adhesion and biofilm formation at concentrations from 1/16xMIC to 4xMIC, simvastatin was also able to act against mature biofilms, reducing cell viability and extra-polysaccharide production. In conclusion, simvastatin showed pronounced antimicrobial activity against S. aureus biofilms, reducing their formation and viability.
TI  - Antimicrobial and cytotoxic effects of phosphoric acid solution compared to other root canal irrigants.
AB  - Phosphoric acid has been suggested as an irrigant due to its effectiveness in removing the smear layer. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to compare the antimicrobial and cytotoxic effects of a 37% phosphoric acid solution to other irrigants commonly used in endodontics. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The substances 37% phosphoric acid, 17% EDTA, 10% citric acid, 2% chlorhexidine (solution and gel), and 5.25% NaOCl were evaluated. The antimicrobial activity was tested against Candida albicans, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Actinomyces meyeri, Parvimonas micra, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Prevotella nigrescens according to the agar diffusion method. The cytotoxicity of the irrigants was determined by using the MTT assay. RESULTS: Phosphoric acid presented higher antimicrobial activity compared to the other tested irrigants. With regard to the cell viability, this solution showed results similar to those with 5.25% NaOCl and 2% chlorhexidine (gel and solution), whereas 17% EDTA and 10% citric acid showed higher cell viability compared to other irrigants. CONCLUSION: Phosphoric acid demonstrated higher antimicrobial activity and cytotoxicity similar to that of 5.25% NaOCl and 2% chlorhexidine (gel and solution).
TI  - Synthesis, Structural Characterization and Biological Activity of Novel Cyclohexane-1,3-dione Ligands and Their Metal Complexes.
AB  - Some new Zn(II) and Cu(II) complexes [Cu(L1)(OAc)2]H2O, [Cu(L1)(NO3)H2O]NO33.5H2O, [Zn(L1)(NO3)2]4.5H2O, [Zn(L1)(OAc)2(H2O)2]3H2O, [Cu2(L2)(OAc)4]2H2O2DMF, [Cu(L2)2]2NO31.5DMFH2O, [Zn(L2)2(NO3)2]DMF and [Zn2(L2)(OAc)4(H2O)4]5H2O; L1 = 2-[2-(2-methoxyphenyl)hydrazono]cyclohexane-1,3-dione and L2 = 2-[2-(3-nitrophenyl)hydrazono]cyclohexane-1,3-dione were synthesized and characterized by IR, 1H-NMR,13C-NMR and ultraviolet (UV-Vis.) spectroscopy, elemental analysis, magnetic susceptibility, mass spectrometry and thermogravimetry-differential thermal analysis (TGA-DTA). The synthesized ligands and their complexes were tested for antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, and Salmonella typhimurium CCM 583. Some of complexes showed medium-level antibacterial activity against the test bacteria compared with ampicillin.
TI  - Composition and Antimicrobial Activity of Euphrasia rostkoviana Hayne Essential Oil.
AB  - Eyebright, Euphrasia rostkoviana Hayne (Scrophulariaceae), is a medicinal plant traditionally used in Europe for the treatment of various health disorders, especially as eyewash to treat eye ailments such as conjunctivitis and blepharitis that can be associated with bacterial infections. Some Euphrasia species have been previously reported to contain essential oil. However, the composition and bioactivity of E. rostkoviana oil are unknown. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the eyebright essential oil against some organisms associated with eye infections: Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Candida albicans. GC-MS analysis revealed more than 70 constituents, with n-hexadecanoic acid (18.47%) as the main constituent followed by thymol (7.97%), myristic acid (4.71%), linalool (4.65%), and anethole (4.09%). The essential oil showed antimicrobial effect against all organisms tested with the exception of P. aeruginosa. The best activity was observed against all Gram-positive bacteria tested with the minimum inhibitory concentrations of 512 microg/mL. This is the first report on the chemical composition of E. rostkoviana essential oil and its antimicrobial activity.
TI  - Probiotic features of Lactobacillus strains isolated from Ragusano and Pecorino Siciliano cheeses.
AB  - In the present study 177 Lactobacillus spp. strains, isolated from Ragusano and Pecorino Siciliano cheeses, were in vitro screened for probiotic traits, and their characteristics were compared to those of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, commercial strain. Based on acidic and bile salt resistance, thirteen Lactobacillus strains were selected. The multiplex-PCR application revealed that nine strains belonged to L. rhamnosus species and four to Lactobacillus paracasei species. All selected strains were further investigated for transit tolerance in simulated upper gastrointestinal tract (GI), for adhesion capacity to human intestinal cell lines, for hydrophobicity, for co-aggregation and auto-aggregation and for antimicrobial activities. Moreover, antibiotic resistance, hemolytic and bile salt hydrolase activities were investigated for safety assessment. Viable counts after simulated gastric and duodenal transit revealed that overall the selected lactobacilli tolerated better pancreatic juice and bile salts than acidic juice. In particular, three L. rhamnosus strains (FS10, FS2, and PS11) and one L. paracasei strain (PM8) increased their cell density after the simulated GI transit. The same strains showed also high percentage of auto-aggregation and co-aggregation with Escherichia coli. All strains were effective against both Staphylococcus aureus and E. coli and variability was achieved versus Listeria monocytogenes and Enterococcus faecalis used as pathogenic indicator strains. Different behavior was revealed by strains for adhesion ability and hydrophobicity, which are not always linked each other and are strongly strain-dependent. From the safety point of view, no isolate showed hemolytic and bile salt hydrolase activities, except one, and most of the strains were sensitive to a broad range of clinical antibiotics. This work showed that the L. rhamnosus FS10 and the L. paracasei PM8 are good promising probiotic candidates for further in vivo investigations.
TI  - [Bloodstream infections in southwestern China: 2012 Whire Union report on bacterial susceptibility to antibiotics].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To test the susceptibility of blood culture isolates to antibiotics in a sample of hospitals in Southwestern China in 2012. METHODS: Blood culture samples were taken and tested from the patients under the Whire Union surveillance in three tertiary hospitals in Southwestern China in 2012. We performed antimicrobial susceptibility analyses on the blood culture isolates using WHONET5. 5 and SPSS19.0. RESULTS: A total of 1745 isolates were identified: 877 Gram-positive (50.26%); 868 Gram-negative (49.74%). Coagulase-negative Staphylococcius (CNS, 541 strains, 31.00%), Escherichia coli (ECO, 379 strains, 21.72%), Klebsiella spp. (170 strains, 9.74%), Enterococcus spp. (143 strains, 8.20%) and Staphylococcus aureus (SAU, 128 strains, 7.34%) comprised the majority of isolates. Methicillin-resistant was found in 37.5% of S. aureus and 85.4% of CNS, respectively. Zero and 6.3% resistance to vancomycin were found for Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium, respectively,compared with a 1.4% and 7.9% resistance to linezolid, respectively. Imipenem-resistance occurred in 0.7% E. coli, 3.6% Klebsiella spp., and 11.1% Enterobacter spp.. Nonfermenters were highly resistant to carbapenems, with an imipenem resistance rate of 25.0% in P. aeruginosa and 79.1% in Acinetobacter baumannii. Antimicrobial usage and critical-care units were identified as risk factors for MRSA and multi-drug-resistant A. baumannii infections. Patients undergoing tracheotomy/endotracheal intubation were likely to develop multi-drug-resistant A. baumannii infections than others. CONCLUSION: CNS, E. coli,Klebsiella spp., Enterococcus spp. and S. aureus were the predominant organisms in bloodstream infections in Southwestern China. Low methicillin-resistant rate was found in Staphylococcus aureus. But vancomycin-resistant rate was high in E. faecium. Imipenem-resistant rates varied in Enterobacteriaceae: higher in non-fermenting bacteria especially in Acinetobacter spp. Use of abtimicrobial drugs and invasive procedures can lead to development of antimicrobial drugs-resistance.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of propylene glycol, glycerine, polyethylene glycol 400, and polyethylene glycol 1000 against selected microorganisms.
AB  - AIM: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the bactericidal activity of propylene glycol, glycerine, polyethylene glycol 400 (PEG 400), and polyethylene glycol 1000 (PEG 1000) against selected microorganisms in vitro. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five vehicles, namely propylene glycol, glycerine, PEG 400, PEG 1000, and combination of propylene glycol with PEG 400, were tested for their bactericidal activity. The minimum bactericidal concentration was noted against four standard strains of organisms, i.e. Streptococcus mutans American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) 25175, Streptococcus mutans ATCC 12598, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 35550, and Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, using broth dilution assay. Successful endodontic therapy depends upon thorough disinfection of root canals. In some refractory cases, routine endodontic therapy is not sufficient, so intracanal medicaments are used for proper disinfection of canals. Intracanal medicaments are dispensed with vehicles which aid in increased diffusion through the dentinal tubules and improve their efficacy. Among the various vehicles used, glycerine is easily available, whereas others like propylene glycol and polyethylene glycol have to be procured from appropriate sources. Also, these vehicles, being viscous, aid in sustained release of the medicaments and improve their handling properties. The most commonly used intracanal medicaments like calcium hydroxide are ineffective on many microorganisms, while most of the other medicaments like MTAD (Mixture of Tetracycline, an Acid, and a Detergent) and Triple Antibiotic Paste (TAP) consist of antibiotics which can lead to development of antibiotic resistance among microorganisms. Thus, in order to use safer and equally effective intracanal medicaments, newer alternatives like chlorhexidine gluconate, ozonized water, etc., are being explored. Similarly, the five vehicles mentioned above are being tested for their antimicrobial activity in this study. RESULTS: All vehicles exhibited bactericidal activity at 100% concentration. CONCLUSION: Propylene glycol was effective against three organisms namely S. mutans E. faecalis and E. coli and its bactericidal activity was at 50%, 25% and 50% respectively. PEG 1000 was effective against S. mutans and E. coli at 25%. Hence propylene glycol was effective on more number of organisms of which E. faecalis is a known resistant species. PEG 1000 was bactericidal at a lower concentration but was effective on two organisms only.
TI  - A derivative of the thiopeptide GE2270A highly selective against Propionibacterium acnes.
AB  - A chemical derivative of the thiopeptide GE2270A, designated NAI003, was found to possess a substantially reduced antibacterial spectrum in comparison to the parent compound, being active against just a few Gram-positive bacteria. In particular, NAI003 retained low MICs against all tested isolates of Propionibacterium acnes and, to a lesser extent, against Enterococcus faecalis. Furthermore, NAI003 showed a time- and dose-dependent killing of both a clindamycin-resistant and a clindamycin-sensitive P. acnes isolate. Gel-shift experiments indicated that, like the parent compound, NAI003 retained the ability to bind to elongation factors (EF) Tu derived from Escherichia coli, E. faecalis or P. acnes, albeit with reduced efficiency. In contrast, EF-Tu's derived from the NAI003-insenstitive Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes did not bind this compound. These results were confirmed by in vitro studies using a hybrid translation system, which indicated that NAI003 can inhibit most efficiently protein synthesis driven by the P. acnes EF-Tu. P. acnes mutants resistant to NAI003 were isolated by direct plating. With one exception, all analyzed strains carried mutation in the tuf gene, encoding EF-Tu. Because of its selective effect on P. acnes in comparison to resident skin flora, NAI003 represents a promising candidate for the topical treatment of acne, which has already completed a Phase 1 clinical study.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity and chemical composition of the essential oils of Portuguese Foeniculum vulgare fruits.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of essential oils obtained by hydrodistillation from fruits of six fennel accessions collected from wild populations occurring in the centre and south of Portugal. Composition of essential oils was established by Gas Chromatography-Flame Ionization Detector (GC-FID) and Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. The obtained yields of the essential oils were found to vary greatly in the range of 1.1 to 2.9% (v/w) and the chemical composition varied with the region of collection. A total of 16 compounds were identified. The main compounds were fenchone (16.9 - 34.7%), estragole (2.5 - 66.0%) and trans-anethole (7.9 - 77.7%). The percentages of these three main compounds were used to determine the relationship between the different oil samples and to group them into four different chemotypes: anethole/fenchone; anethole; estragole and anethole/estragole. Antifungal activity of essential oils was evaluated against six food spoilage fungi: Aspergillus niger, A. japonicus, A. oryzae, Fusarium oxysporum, Rhizophus oryzae and R. stolonifer. Antibacterial activity was assessed against three Gram-positive strains: Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228 and S. aureus ATCC 28213; and against six Gram-negative strains: Escherichia coli ATCC 25922; Morganella morganii LFG 08; Proteus mirabilis LFG 04; Salmonella enteritidis LFG 05; S. entiritidis serovar typhimurium LFG 06 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 by the disc diffusion agar method; the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined using the broth macro-dilution method. The MIC values varied from 62.5 (E. coli ATCC 25922) to 2000 micromL (P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853).
TI  - Improved antibacterial phototoxicity of a neutral porphyrin in natural deep eutectic solvents.
AB  - Neutral porphyrins for antibacterial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) have received little attention due to their tendency to aggregate in aqueous media and reports of low phototoxic effect. These compounds may be less toxic to cells than positively and negatively charged photosensitisers. The preparation of highly bacterial phototoxic formulations of neutral porphyrins remains an open field of research with great potential if achievable. The purpose of this study was to develop novel hydrophilic formulations of the neutral porphyrin 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-porphyrin (THPP) by use of natural deep eutectic solvents (NADES) prepared by the solvent evaporation method. Physical and photochemical stability and in vitro photoinactivation of Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli were investigated. Two of the 15 NADES investigated demonstrated superior solubilising properties of THPP. The photostability of THPP was higher in NADES than in methanol. A 100-fold dilution of the preparations with buffer to a final concentration of 0.5-5nM THPP resulted in complete photoinactivation of E. faecalis and E. coli both in their exponential and stationary phase. THPP demonstrated significantly higher phototoxicity when formulated in NADES than in other aqueous preparations like phosphate buffered saline. NADES as a formulation concept for photosensitisers shows a great potential in aPDT.
TI  - Polyamine derivatives of betulinic acid and beta-sitosterol: A comparative investigation.
AB  - beta-Sitosterol and betulinic acid were used in designing their conjugates with selected polyamines bearing either an amide bond, or an ester and an amide bond simultaneously in the target molecule. The synthesized compounds were subjected to basic cytotoxic and antimicrobial tests. The synthetic protocol is described separately for each of the three series of the target amides, because each series of compounds required a different synthetic approach. The cytotoxicity was tested on cells derived from human T-lymphoblastic leukemia, breast adenocarcinoma and cervical cancer, and compared with the tests on normal human fibroblasts. Most of the target compounds (5a-5c, 11a-11c and 16a-16c) showed medium to high cytotoxicity (0.7-7.8muM), however, in some cases the compounds showed high cytotoxicity even toward normal human fibroblasts (11a-11c). Two compounds of this series (11c and 16c) also displayed antimicrobial activity with high and selective microbe specificity. The compound 11c was potent against Escherichia coli (minimal inhibition concentration (MIC) 6.25mugmL(-1), i.e. 9.75nMmL(-1)) and Staphylococcus aureus (MIC 12.5mugmL(-1), i.e. 19.5nMmL(-1)), and showed medium activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The compound 16c was highly active against Enterococcus faecalis and S. aureus (both, MIC 3.125mugmL(-1), i.e. 4.22nMmL(-1)), both Gram-positive bacteria, however showed only weak activity against E. coli and no activity against P. aeruginosa, both Gram-negative bacteria, which indicates possible microbe specificity of 16c. Comparing beta-sitosterol-based series (5a-5c) and betulinic acid series (11a-11c and 16a-16c) of the target compounds, the latter one gave more promising structures. The compounds 11c and 16c showed effects which may be described as multifarious activity (pleiotropic effects).
TI  - Surrogate testing suggests that chlorine dioxide gas exposure would not inactivate Ebola virus contained in environmental blood contamination.
AB  - The ability to decontaminate a room potentially containing the Ebola virus is important to healthcare facilities in the United States. Ebola virus remains viable in body fluids, a room that has housed a patient with Ebola virus disease must have all surfaces manually wiped with an approved disinfectant, which increases occupational exposure risk. This study evaluated the efficacy of gaseous chlorine dioxide inactivation of bacterial organisms in blood as Ebola virus surrogates and as the organisms used by the Nebraska Biocontainment Unit to provide the margin of safety for decontamination. Bacillus anthracis, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, and Mycobacterium smegmatis blood suspensions that were exposed to ClO2 gas concentrations and exposure limits. The log reduction in Colony Forming Units (CFU) was determined for each bacterial blood suspension. Exposure parameters approximating industry practices for ClO2 environmental decontamination (360ppm concentration to 780 ppm-hrs exposure, 65% relative humidity) as well as parameters exceeding current practice (1116 ppm concentration to 1400 ppm-hrs exposure; 1342ppm concentration to 1487 ppm-hrs exposure) were evaluated. Complete inactivation was not achieved for any of the bacterial blood suspensions tested. Reductions were observed in concentrations of B. anthracis spores (1.3 -3.76 log) and E. faecalis vegetative cells (1.3 log) whereas significant reductions in vegetative cell concentrations for E. coli and M. smegmatis blood suspensions were not achieved. Our results showed that bacteria in the presence of blood were not inactivated using gaseous ClO2 decontamination. ClO2 decontamination alone should not be used for Ebola virus, but decontamination processes should first include manual wiping of potentially contaminated blood; especially for microorganisms as infectious as the Ebola virus.
TI  - A novel method for screening of potential probiotics for high adhesion capability.
AB  - To screen for potential probiotics with high adhesion capability, a chemostat model-based cultured human feces and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis methods were applied, and the adhesion capability of the isolates was evaluated in vitro and in vivo. Lactobacillus plantarum (HM218749), Lactobacillus reuteri (EU547310), and Enterococcus faecalis (HM218543) were isolated from the slime on the chemostat wall, as these organisms could grow better at 37 degrees C in an anaerobic environment and could resist harsh conditions (pH 1.5 and 0.30% bile salt). Lactobacillus plantarum, L. reuteri, and E. faecalis could adhere to HT-29 cells and reduce the adhesion of Shigella dysenteriae 2457, Staphylococcus Cowan1, Enterobacter sakazakii 45401, and Escherichia coli 44102 to HT-29 cells. Moreover, the animal experiment showed that L. plantarum could adhere to mice intestine, increasing the number of lactobacilli and decreasing the number of enterococci.
TI  - Preparation, characterization and antibacterial properties of ZnO/kaoline nanocomposites.
AB  - This paper describes laboratory preparation, characterization and antibacterial activity testing of ZnO/kaoline composites. ZnO/kaoline composites with 50wt.% of ZnO were laboratory prepared, dried at 105 degrees C and calcined at 500 degrees C. XRPD analysis revealed that thermal treatment caused the phase transformation of Zn containing precursor into ZnO. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy techniques were used for characterization of morphology of the prepared samples. A standard microdilution test was used for evaluation of antibacterial activity using four common human pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Daylight was used for induction photocatalytically based antibacterial activity. Second possible explanation of antibacterial activity of ZnO/kaoline could be the presence of biologically available forms of zinc. During the antibacterial activity assays the ZnO/kaoline composites exhibited antibacterial activity, where differences in an onset of the antibacterial activity and activity against bacterial strains were observed. The highest antibacterial activity was observed against S. aureus, where the lowest value of minimum inhibitory concentration was determined equal to 0.41mg/ml.
TI  - Quantitatively predicting bacterial adhesion using surface free energy determined with a spectrophotometric method.
AB  - Bacterial adhesion onto solid surfaces is of importance in a wide spectrum of problems, including environmental microbiology, biomedical research, and various industrial applications. Despite many research efforts, present thermodynamic models that rely on the evaluation of the adhesion energy are often elusive in predicting the bacterial adhesion behavior. Here, we developed a new spectrophotometric method to determine the surface free energy (SFE) of bacterial cells. The adhesion behaviors of five bacterial species, Pseudomonas putida KT2440, Salmonella Typhimurium ATCC 14028, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, and Escherichia coli DH5alpha, onto two model substratum surfaces, i.e., clean glass and silanized glass surfaces, were studied. We found that bacterial adhesion was unambiguously mediated by the SFE difference between the bacterial cells and the solid substratum. The lower the SFE difference, the higher degree of bacterial adhesion. We therefore propose the use of the SFE difference as an accurate and simple thermodynamic measure for quantitatively predicting bacterial adhesion. The methodological advance and thermodynamic simplification in the paper have implications in controlling bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation on solid surfaces.
TI  - Urinary tract infections and antimicrobial sensitivity among diabetic patients at Khartoum, Sudan.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) are more susceptible to urinary  tract infection (UTI) than non-diabetics. Due to the emergence of multidrug resistant (MDR) uropathogenic strains, the choice of antimicrobial agent is restricted. This study investigated the epidemiology of UTI, antimicrobial susceptibility, and resistance patterns of bacterial isolates from adult diabetic patients. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted at Khartoum Hospital, Sudan during the period of March - September 2013. Consecutive patients (men and women) were approached to participate in the study, irrespective of UTI symptoms. Socio-demographic and clinical data were obtained from each participant using pre-tested questionnaires. Clean-catch, midstream urine samples were collected and cultured for UTI diagnosis and antimicrobial susceptibility. Symptomatic bacteriuria was defined as a positive urine culture (>/=10(5) colony-forming units [CFU]/mL of a single bacterial species) from patients with symptoms associated with UTI; asymptomatic bacteriuria was defined as a positive urine culture from patients without symptoms associated with UTI. RESULTS: A total of 200 diabetic patients were enrolled, 121 (60.5%) men and 79 (39.5%) women; 193 (96.5%) had type II DM. The overall prevalence of UTI was 39 (19.5%). Among the total population, 17.1% and 20.9% had symptomatic and asymptomatic bacteriuria, respectively. According to multivariate logistic regression, none of the investigated factors (age, sex, type of DM and duration) were associated with UTI. The predominant isolates were Escherichia coli (22, [56.4%]), and Klebsiella pneumoniae, [9, (23%)]. Eight of 22 E. coli, four of nine K. pneumoniae and one of five Enterococcus faecalis isolates originated from symptomatic patients. Six, four, three, and two of 22 E. coli isolates showed resistance to ampicillin, co-trimoxazole, nitrofurantoin, and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, respectively. Two, two, one and one of nine K. pneumoniae isolates were resistant to ampicillin, co-trimoxazole, cephalexin, and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. All 22 E. coli isolates were sensitive (100%) to gentamicin and cephalexin. All nine K. pneumoniae were sensitive to gentamicin (100%) and 88.8% were sensitive to cephalexin. CONCLUSION: In Sudan, about one-fifth of diabetic patients have UTI. E. coli is the most frequent isolate followed by K. pneumoniae.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial and anti-endotoxin action of Zingiber Officinale as auxiliary chemical and medicament combined to calcium hydroxide and chlorhexidine.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted in vitro to compare the effectiveness of Zingiber Officinale as an auxiliary chemical substance followed by placement of different intra-canal medication in removing endotoxins and cultivable micro-organisms from infected root canals. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy-two root canals were contaminated with Enterococcus faecalis, Candida albicans and Escherichia coli for 28 days. After, the teeth were instrumented using Zingiber Officinale and divided into six groups according to the intra-canal medication: chlorhexidine gel; calcium hydroxide + chlorhexidine gel; glycolic ginger extract; calcium hydroxide + glycolic ginger extract; calcium hydroxide + saline solution and saline solution (control). Sample collections were performed after root canal contamination (Baseline; S1), after instrumentation (S2), 7 days after instrumentation (S3), after 14 days with intra-canal medication (S4) and 7 days after removal of intra-canal medication (S5). The results were analyzed by the Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn tests. RESULTS: It was observed that in S2 and S3 there was significant reduction of the micro-organisms and the quantity of endotoxins after instrumentation. In samples S4 and S5 there was complete elimination of micro-organisms and significant reduction of endotoxins. CONCLUSION: It was concluded that Zingiber Officinale as an auxiliary chemical substance was effective on the micro-organisms tested, yet was unable to eliminate the endotoxins. Similarly, the intra-canal medication were effective on micro-organisms, yet did not completely eliminate the endotoxins.
TI  - Evaluation of regional antibiograms to monitor antimicrobial resistance in Hampton Roads, Virginia.
AB  - We studied recent antibiograms (2010 to 2011) from 12 hospitals in the Hampton Roads area, Virginia, that refer patients to a tertiary-care facility affiliated with Eastern Virginia Medical School. The data was compiled into a regional antibiogram, and sensitivity rates of common isolates from the tertiary-care facility (central) were compared to those of referring hospitals grouped by locale. Staphylococcus aureus was the most common Gram- positive and E. coli the most common Gram- negative organism grown from clinical samples in the area. Overall 53% of S.aureus isolates were resistant to oxacillin. There was a broad scatter of MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration) for vancomycin within the susceptibility range, and MIC of 4 mug/mL was reported in 2012. Penicillin resistance was seen in 50% and erythromycin resistance in 45% of Streptococcus pneumoniae. Vancomycin resistance was seen in 75% of Enterococcus faecium and 2% of Enterococcus faecalis respectively. Acinetobacter baumannii was the most resistant Gram negative organism in the data compiled. Among the Escherichia coli, 26%, 44% and 52%were resistant to Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole ( SXT) ampicillin- sulbactam and ampicillin respectively. We found significant differences in methodology, interpretation and antibiotic panels used by area laboratories. Based on these findings, we are now prospectively following resistance patterns in the tertiary-care facility, sharing data, and creating a consistent approach to antimicrobial susceptibility testing in the region.
TI  - Antimicrobial evaluation of plants used for the treatment of diarrhoea in a rural community in northern Maputaland, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Zulu people living in the rural area of Maputaland (KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa) rely heavily on medicinal plants for the treatment of diarrhoea. Abundant availability of medicinal plants in the study area offers low cost health care, but scientific validation is needed in order to lend credibility to the traditional use against many ailments including diarrhoeal infections. With this in mind a study was designed to test the in vitro antimicrobial efficacy of 23 plant species which are used for the treatment of diarrhoea in rural Maputaland. Four 1:1 plant combinations were also evaluated to determine their interactive effects against seven diarrhoea-related bacterial pathogens. METHODS: Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) assays were undertaken on dichloromethane-methanol (CH2Cl2: MeOH) and aqueous crude extracts. The following micro-organisms were selected for this study and were tested based on their association with stomach ailments and diarrhoea; Bacillus cereus (ATCC 11778), Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29212), Escherichia coli (ATCC 8739), Proteus vulgaris (ATCC 33420), Salmonella typhimurium (ATCC 14028), Shigella flexneri (ATCC 25875) and Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 12600). The fractional inhibitory concentration index (SigmaFIC) was determined for plants traditionally used in combination. RESULTS: Shigella flexneri proved to be the most susceptible pathogen, where the organic extract of Terminalia sericea showed the most prominent noteworthy antibacterial activity (mean MIC value of 0.04 mg/mL). The aqueous extracts generally showed poorer antimicrobial activity with some exceptions i.e. Acacia burkei, Brachylaena transvaalensis against B. cereus and B. transvaalensis against S. flexneri. In the combination studies, synergy was predominant with mean (across all pathogens) SigmaFIC values of 0.30 for Acanthospermum glabratum with Krauseola mosambicina; SigmaFIC values of 0.46 for A. glabratum with Psidium guajava; SigmaFIC values of 0.39 for B. transvaalensis with P. guajava and SigmaFIC values of 0.88 (additive) for the combination of B. transvaalensis with Sclerocarya birrea. CONCLUSION: This study provided some insight into the bacterial in vitro efficacies of plants traditionally used to treat diarrhoea by the people of Northern Maputaland. Very little connection was observed between frequency of use and efficacy. Plant combinations demonstrated favourable efficacy with mostly synergistic effects noted, lending some credibility to their use in combination.
TI  - In Vitro Evaluation of Antimicrobial Photodynamic Therapy Associated with Hydroalcoholic Extracts of Schinopsis brasiliensis Engl.: New Therapeutic Perspectives.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the photodynamic potential of extracts of Schinopsis brasiliensis Engl. on bacteria involved in several human infections. BACKGROUND DATA: Photodynamic therapy (PDT) involves the interaction of light with an appropriate and photosensitizer wavelength, and the prospect of existing photosensitive compounds in herbal extracts enhanced by the application of laser diode has been promising. METHODS: The antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus faecalis was obtained by the disk diffusion method on agar. The laser diode InGaAIP was used with 660 nm wavelength, 100 mW, and 4 J/cm(2), and the application was performed in a timely manner for 34 sec on each disk tested. The groups tested were: Laser and bark extract (B+L+); bark extract only (B+L-); Laser and leaf extract (F+L+); leaf extract only (F+L-); Laser and malachite green (M+L+); malachite green only (M+L-); and laser only (L+). RESULTS: There were significant differences between the B+L- and B+L+ groups (p=0.029) and between the L+F- and L+F+ groups (p=0.029) at various concentrations of the nebulized extracts of bark and leaf. Among the tested pathogens, S. aureus showed the highest zone of inhibition, 24.55+/-0.36 mm in group B+L+, 500 mg.mL(-1). CONCLUSIONS: PDT with malachite green was effective, and groups B+L+ and F+L+ showed excellent activity on the bacteria tested, suggesting the presence of photosensitizers in extracts of S. brasiliensis Engl.
TI  - Semi-synthesis of new antimicrobial esters from the natural oleanolic and maslinic acids.
AB  - In this article, we report an effective procedure for the selective isolation of  oleanolic acid 1 and maslinic acid 2 (3.4 and 8.5mg/g DW, respectively) from pomace olive (Olea europaea L.) using an ultrasonic bath, and the synthesis of a series of new triterpenic acid esters. The compounds were characterized by their spectral data and were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity. Among the compounds tested, those having sulfur and chlorine atoms were found to be antibacterial. They showed activity against two Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis and two Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MICs within a range of 5-25mug/mL). The fungus Penicillium italicum was found to be the most sensitive to both sulfur derivatives: (3beta)-3-((thiophene-2-carbonyl)oxy)-olean-12-en-28-oic acid (1a) (IZ=22mm) and (2alpha,3beta-2,3-bis((thiophene-2-carbonyl)oxy)olean-12-en-28-oic acid (2a) (IZ=24mm).
TI  - The conserved modular elements of the acyl carrier proteins of lipid synthesis are only partially interchangeable.
AB  - Prior work showed that expression of acyl carrier proteins (ACPs) of a diverse set of bacteria replaced the function of Escherichia coli ACP in lipid biosynthesis. However, the AcpAs of Lactococcus lactis and Enterococcus faecalis were inactive. Both failed to support growth of an E. coli acpP mutant strain. This defect seemed likely because of the helix II sequences of the two AcpAs, which differed markedly from those of the proteins that supported growth. To test this premise, chimeric ACPs were constructed in which L. lactis helix II replaced helix II of E. coli AcpP and vice versa. Expression of the AcpP protein L. lactis AcpA helix II allowed weak growth, whereas the L. lactis AcpA-derived protein that contained E. coli AcpP helix II failed to support growth of the E. coli mutant strain. Replacement of the L. lactis AcpA helix II residues in this protein showed that substitution of valine for the phenylalanine residue four residues downstream of the phosphopanthetheine-modified serine gave robust growth and allowed modification by the endogenous AcpS phosphopantetheinyl transferase (rather than the promiscuous Sfp transferase required to modify the L. lactis AcpA and the chimera of L. lactis AcpA helix II in AcpP). Further chimera constructs showed that the lack of function of the L. lactis AcpA-derived protein containing E. coli AcpP helix II was due to incompatibility of L. lactis AcpA helix I with the downstream elements of AcpP. Therefore, the origins of ACP incompatibility can reside in either helix I or in helix II.
TI  - Urinary tract infections: epidemiology, mechanisms of infection and treatment options.
AB  - Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a severe public health problem and are caused by a range of pathogens, but most commonly by Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus saprophyticus. High recurrence rates and increasing antimicrobial resistance among uropathogens threaten to greatly increase the economic burden of these infections. In this Review, we discuss how basic science studies are elucidating the molecular details of the crosstalk that occurs at the host-pathogen interface, as well as the consequences of these interactions for the pathophysiology of UTIs. We also describe current efforts to translate this knowledge into new clinical treatments for UTIs.
TI  - Nanostructured sensor based on carbon nanotubes and clavanin A for bacterial detection.
AB  - Unusual methods for specific detection of pathogenic bacteria are becoming key points for control and identification of problems related to health and (bio)safety. In this context, this work aims to propose a new approach for the development of nanostructured biosensors based on carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and antimicrobial peptides for bacterial detection. Firstly, the antimicrobial peptide clavanin A (ClavA) was chemically immobilized on CNTs and surface-immobilized ClavA was used to detect Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis in a direct assay format. We used electrochemical impedance spectroscopy technique to evaluate the effectiveness and sensitivity of the ClavA-based biosensors by measuring the modifications in their electrochemical responses before and after incubation in presence of different bacteria concentrations. The biosensor was able to discriminate between bacteria concentrations in the 102-106CFUmL-1 range. Atomic force microscopy analysis confirmed the biosensor functionality for bacterial recognition. This new sensor system was capable of differentiating between Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, since ClavA showed different affinities toward the pathogenic bacteria species.
TI  - Prevalence, resistance patterns, and risk factors for antimicrobial resistance in bacteria from retail chicken meat in Colombia.
AB  - As a step toward implementing the Colombian Integrated Program for Antimicrobial  Resistance Surveillance (COIPARS), this study aimed to establish the baseline antimicrobial resistance patterns of Salmonella serovars, Escherichia coli, and Enterococcus spp. isolates in retail poultry meat from independent stores and from a main chain distributor center. MICs of the isolates were determined for antimicrobials used both in humans and animals, using an automated system. Salmonella serovars were isolated from 26% of the meat samples and E. coli from 83%, whereas Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium were detected in 81 and 13% of the meat samples, respectively. A principal finding of concern in this study was that almost 98% of isolates tested were multidrug resistant. Ceftiofur, enrofloxacin, nalidixic acid, and tetracycline were the antimicrobials that showed the highest frequency of resistance among Salmonella and E. coli isolates. For enterococci, 61.5% of E. faecium isolates were found to be resistant to quinupristin-dalfopristin; this is significant because it is used to treat nosocomial infections when vancomycin resistance is present. Vancomycin resistance was detected in 4% of the E. faecalis isolates. The results of our study highlight the need for rapid implementation of an integrated program for surveillance of antimicrobial resistance by the Colombian authorities in order to monitor trends, raise awareness, and help promote practices to safeguard later generation antimicrobial agents.
TI  - 2-Alkyl(aryl)-quinazolin-4(3H)-thiones, 2-R-(quinazolin-4(3H)-ylthio)carboxylic acids and amides: synthesis, molecular docking, antimicrobial and anticancer properties.
AB  - In this study, a series of novel 2-alkyl(aryl)-quinazolin-4(3H)-thiones, 2-R-(quinazolin-4(3H)-ylthio)carboxylic acids and amides were synthesized and evaluated for antimicrobial and anticancer activities. Their structure was confirmed by elemental analysis and spectral data (FT-IR, LC-MS, 1H-NMR). Antimicrobial activity was tested in vitro against Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Candida albicans and NCI in vitro preliminary anticancer activity against nine different cancer types. The most active antibacterial and antifungal compounds were: 2.1, 2.2 and 2.4. The introduction of the carboxylic acid or amide residue into the fourth position of quinazolin-4(3H)-thione resulted in the absence of antimicrobial activity. Substance 3.8 inhibited renal cancer UO-31 line and 2.18 - leukemia CCRF-CEM. The results of in silico molecular docking for DHFR and CK2 kinase had no correlation with in vitro properties, proposing the presence of other biological activity pathways.
TI  - Genome Modification in Enterococcus faecalis OG1RF Assessed by Bisulfite Sequencing and Single-Molecule Real-Time Sequencing.
AB  - Enterococcus faecalis is a Gram-positive bacterium that natively colonizes the human gastrointestinal tract and opportunistically causes life-threatening infections. Multidrug-resistant (MDR) E. faecalis strains have emerged, reducing treatment options for these infections. MDR E. faecalis strains have large genomes containing mobile genetic elements (MGEs) that harbor genes for antibiotic resistance and virulence determinants. Bacteria commonly possess genome defense mechanisms to block MGE acquisition, and we hypothesize that these mechanisms have been compromised in MDR E. faecalis. In restriction-modification (R-M) defense, the bacterial genome is methylated at cytosine (C) or adenine (A) residues by a methyltransferase (MTase), such that nonself DNA can be distinguished from self DNA. A cognate restriction endonuclease digests improperly modified nonself DNA. Little is known about R-M in E. faecalis. Here, we use genome resequencing to identify DNA modifications occurring in the oral isolate OG1RF. OG1RF has one of the smallest E. faecalis genomes sequenced to date and possesses few MGEs. Single-molecule real-time (SMRT) and bisulfite sequencing revealed that OG1RF has global 5-methylcytosine (m5C) methylation at 5'-GCWGC-3' motifs. A type II R-M system confers the m5C modification, and disruption of this system impacts OG1RF electrotransformability and conjugative transfer of an antibiotic resistance plasmid. A second DNA MTase was poorly expressed under laboratory conditions but conferred global N(4)-methylcytosine (m4C) methylation at 5'-CCGG-3' motifs when expressed in Escherichia coli. Based on our results, we conclude that R-M can act as a barrier to MGE acquisition and likely influences antibiotic resistance gene dissemination in the E. faecalis species. IMPORTANCE: The horizontal transfer of antibiotic resistance genes among bacteria is a critical public health concern. Enterococcus faecalis is an opportunistic pathogen that causes life-threatening infections in humans. Multidrug resistance acquired by horizontal gene transfer limits treatment options for these infections. In this study, we used innovative DNA sequencing methodologies to investigate how a model strain of E. faecalis discriminates its own DNA from foreign DNA, i.e., self versus nonself discrimination. We also assess the role of an E. faecalis genome modification system in modulating conjugative transfer of an antibiotic resistance plasmid. These results are significant because they demonstrate that differential genome modification impacts horizontal gene transfer frequencies in E. faecalis.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of synthetic peptides derived from lactoferricin against Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212.
AB  - Peptides derived from human and bovine lactoferricin were designed, synthesized,  purified, and characterized using RP-HPLC and MALDI-TOF-MS. Specific changes in the sequences were designed as (i) the incorporation of unnatural amino acids in the sequence, the (ii) reduction or (iii) elongation of the peptide chain length, and (iv) synthesis of molecules with different number of branches containing the same sequence. For each peptide, the antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212 was evaluated. Our results showed that Peptides I.2 (RWQWRWQWR) and I.4 ((RRWQWR)4K2Ahx2C2) exhibit bigger or similar activity against E. coli (MIC 4-33 muM) and E. faecalis (MIC 10-33 muM) when they were compared with lactoferricin protein (LF) and some of its derivate peptides as II.1 (FKCRRWQWRMKKLGA) and IV.1 (FKCRRWQWRMKKLGAPSITCVRRAE). It should be pointed out that Peptides I.2 and I.4, containing the RWQWR motif, are short and easy to synthesize; our results demonstrate that it is possible to design and obtain synthetic peptides that exhibit enhanced antibacterial activity using a methodology that is fast and low-cost and that allows obtaining products with a high degree of purity and high yield.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of curcumin I is associated with damaging of bacterial membrane.
AB  - Curcumin, an important constituent of turmeric, is known for various biological activities, primarily due to its antioxidant mechanism. The present study focused on the antibacterial activity of curcumin I, a significant component of commercial curcumin, against four genera of bacteria, including those that are Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis) and Gram-negative (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). These represent prominent human pathogens, particularly in hospital settings. Our study shows the strong antibacterial potential of curcumin I against all the tested bacteria from Gram-positive as well as Gram-negative groups. The integrity of the bacterial membrane was checked using two differential permeabilization indicating fluorescent probes, namely, propidium iodide and calcein. Both the membrane permeabilization assays confirmed membrane leakage in Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria on exposure to curcumin I. In addition, scanning electron microscopy and fluorescence microscopy were employed to confirm the membrane damages in bacterial cells on exposure to curcumin I. The present study confirms the broad-spectrum antibacterial nature of curcumin I, and its membrane damaging property. Findings from this study could provide impetus for further research on curcumin I regarding its antibiotic potential against rapidly emerging bacterial pathogens.
TI  - Hydrogel-based microfluidic incubator for microorganism cultivation and analyses.
AB  - This work presents an array of microfluidic chambers for on-chip culturing of microorganisms in static and continuous shear-free operation modes. The unique design comprises an in-situ polymerized hydrogel that forms gas and reagent permeable culture wells in a glass chip. Utilizing a hydrophilic substrate increases usability by autonomous capillary priming. The thin gel barrier enables efficient oxygen supply and facilitates on-chip analysis by chemical access through the gel without introducing a disturbing flow to the culture. Trapping the suspended microorganisms inside a gel well allows for a much simpler fabrication than in conventional trapping devices as the minimal feature size does not depend on cell size. Nutrients and drugs are provided on-chip in the gel for a self-contained and user-friendly handling. Rapid antibiotic testing in static cultures with strains of Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli is presented. Cell seeding and diffusive medium supply is provided by phaseguide technology, enabling simple operation of continuous culturing with a great flexibility. Cells of Saccharomyces cerevisiae are utilized as a model to demonstrate continuous on-chip culturing.
TI  - Ammonia sanitization of blackwater for safe use as fertilizer.
AB  - Source-separated blackwater from low-flush toilets contains plant-available nutrients and can be used as a fertilizer. The aim of the study was to evaluate the impact on pathogen inactivation when treating blackwater with urea and/or lime. Blackwater was spiked with Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli O157, Enterococcus faecalis, and Ascaris suum eggs, and treated with urea and/or lime in concentrations up to 0.1% w/w. The bottles were kept in a storage facility (manure slurry tank) for 102 days while monitoring the pathogen concentrations. The treatment time needed to meet the requirement for Salmonella and E. coli reduction could be reduced at least six-fold. The enterococci were more persistent, and only the highest treatment doses had a significantly higher inactivation than the controls. The Ascaris egg viability was only reduced by around 50%, so higher urea/lime doses and/or longer treatment times are required to fulfill the treatment requirements of 3 log10 reductions of parasite eggs.
TI  - Fluoroquinolone resistance in bacteremic and low risk febrile neutropenic patients with cancer.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The low risk febrile neutropenic patients with Multinational Association for Supportive Care in Cancer (MASCC) score of more than 20 are recommended to be treated with fluoroquinolone-based oral treatment by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guideline. This recommendation relies, at least partially, on the high sensitivity of the blood culture isolates to fluoroquinolone in clinical trials conducted in Western countries. Whether this also applies in middle or low income countries like China where antibiotic resistance is becoming prevalent recently has not been evaluated. METHODS: All the positive blood culture results from January 2010 to December 2013 in the 2 large Chinese cancer centers were reviewed. The patients were included into the study with the following criteria: febrile neutropenia, solid tumor or lymphoma, MASCC score >20, positive blood cultures within two days of the onset of fever, and detailed treatment history. RESULTS: A total of 38 patients were included in this analysis. Two patients had polymicrobial bacteremia (Enterococcus faecalis and Flavimonas oryzihabitans). Other isolates included coagulase-negative staphylococcus, micrococcal species, viridans streptococci, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli. The majority of the monomicrobial isolates from these 36 patients was Escherichia coli (28 patients, 74%). Notably, in contrast to the high sensitivity to fluoroquinolone from blood culture of the low risk patients in previous reports in Westen countries, a very high drug resistance was observed: 13 out of 28 Escherichia coli isolates (46%) or 14 out of all 38 positive cultures (37%). CONCLUSION: The results warrant further validations in prospective clinical trials in countries where antibiotic resistance is prevalent to ensure appropriate antibiotic administration.
TI  - Inoculation of tannin-degrading bacteria into novel hosts increases performance on tannin-rich diets.
AB  - It has been hypothesized that herbivores host tannin-degrading bacteria (TDB) to  overcome the toxic challenges posed by plant tannins. While TDB have been isolated from the guts of numerous mammals, their functional significance to their hosts has never been explicitly tested. We introduced TDB into lab rats, which do not host TDB, and measured host performance on tannin-rich diets. We first isolated three species of TDB, Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis and Enterococcus faecalis, from the guts of the desert woodrat (Neotoma lepida), which regularly feeds on tannin-rich plants. Then, we inoculated isolated TDB, as well as full woodrat microbial communities into laboratory rats. A control group was inoculated with sterilized woodrat faeces. Recipient lab rats were fed increasing concentrations of tannic acid, and we monitored tannic acid intake, body mass and liver damage as measured by serum alanine aminotransferase activity. Lab rats given TDB as isolates or full communities exhibited increased tannic acid intake, higher maintenance of body mass and lower indicators of liver damage compared with control animals. These differences were maintained when the trial was repeated after 6 weeks of feeding on tannin-free diets. Our results are the first to demonstrate that TDB significantly increase host performance on tannin-rich diets.
TI  - Quantitative profiling of colorectal cancer-associated bacteria reveals associations between fusobacterium spp., enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis (ETBF) and clinicopathological features of colorectal cancer.
AB  - Various studies have presented clinical or in vitro evidence linking bacteria to  colorectal cancer, but these bacteria have not previously been concurrently quantified by qPCR in a single cohort. We quantify these bacteria (Fusobacterium spp., Streptococcus gallolyticus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis (ETBF), Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC), and afaC- or pks-positive E. coli) in paired tumour and normal tissue samples from 55 colorectal cancer patients. We further investigate the relationship between a) the presence and b) the level of colonisation of each bacterial species with site and stage of disease, age, gender, ethnicity and MSI-status. With the exception of S. gallolyticus, we detected all bacteria profiled here in both tumour and normal samples at varying frequencies. ETBF (FDR = 0.001 and 0.002 for normal and tumour samples) and afaC-positive E. coli (FDR = 0.03, normal samples) were significantly enriched in the colon compared to the rectum. ETBF (FDR = 0.04 and 0.002 for normal and tumour samples, respectively) and Fusobacterium spp. (FDR = 0.03 tumour samples) levels were significantly higher in late stage (III/IV) colorectal cancers. Fusobacterium was by far the most common bacteria detected, occurring in 82% and 81% of paired tumour and normal samples. Fusobacterium was also the only bacterium that was significantly higher in tumour compared to normal samples (p = 6e-5). We also identified significant associations between high-level colonisation by Fusobacterium and MSI-H (FDR = 0.05), age (FDR = 0.03) or pks-positive E. coli (FDR = 0.01). Furthermore, we exclusively identified atypical EPEC in our cohort, which has not been previously reported in association with colorectal cancer. By quantifying colorectal cancer-associated bacteria across a single cohort, we uncovered inter- and intra-individual patterns of colonization not previously recognized, as well as important associations with clinicopathological features, especially in the case of Fusobacterium and ETBF.
TI  - [Analysis of pathogenic bacteria and drug resistance in neonatal purulent meningitis].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the clinical characteristics, pathogenic bacteria, and antibiotics resistance of neonatal purulent meningitis in order to provide the guide for early diagnosis and appropriate treatment. METHOD: A retrospective review was performed and a total of 112 cases of neonatal purulent meningitis (male 64, female 58) were identified in the neonatal intensive care unit of Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University seen from January 1, 2004 to December 31, 2013. The clinical information including pathogenic bacterial distribution, drug sensitivity, head imageology and therapeutic outcome were analyzed. Numeration data were shown in ratio and chi square test was applied for group comparison. RESULT: Among 112 cases, 46 were admitted from 2004 to 2008 and 66 from 2009 to 2013, 23 patients were preterm and 89 were term, 20 were early onset (occurring within 3 days of life) and 92 were late onset meningitis (occurring after 3 days of life). In 62 (55.4%) cases the pathogens were Gram-positive bacteria and in 50 (44.6%) were Gram-negative bacteria. The five most frequently isolated pathogens were Escherichia coli (32 cases, 28.6%), coagulase-negative staphylococcus (CNS, 20 cases, 17.9%), Streptococcus (18 cases, 16.1%, Streptococcus agalactiae 15 cases), Enterococci (13 cases, 11.6%), Staphylococcus aureus (9 cases, 8.0%). Comparison of pathogenic bacterial distribution between 2004-2008 and 2009-2013 showed that Gram-positive bacteria accounted for more than 50% in both period. Escherichia coli was the most common bacterium, followed by Streptococcus in last five years which was higher than the first five years (22.7% (15/66) vs. 6.5% (3/46), chi(2) = 5.278, P < 0.05). Klebsiella pneumoniae was more common isolate in preterm infants than in term infants (13.0% (3/23) vs. 1.1% (1/89), chi(2) = 7.540, P < 0.05). Streptococcus (most were Streptococcus agalactiae) was the most common bacteria in early onset meningitis and higher than those in late onset meningitis (35.0% (7/20) vs. 12.0% (11/92), chi(2) = 4.872, P < 0.05). Drug sensitivity tests showed that all the Gram-positive bacterial isolates were sensitive to linezolid. Staphylococci were resistant to penicillin, and most of them were resistant to erythromycin, oxacillin and cefazolin; 77.8%of CNS isolates were methicillin-resistant staphylococcus. No Streptococcus and Enterococcus faecalis was resistant to penicillin. None of enterococci was resistant to vancomycin. Among the Gram-negative bacterial isolates, more than 40% of Escherichia coli were resistant to commonly used cephalosporins such as cefuroxime, cefotaxime and ceftazidime, and all of them were sensitive to amikacin, cefoperazone sulbactam and imipenem. Isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae were all resistant to ampicillin, cefuroxime, cefotaxime and ceftazidime, but none of them was resistant to piperacillin tazobactam and imipenem. Of the 112 patients, 69 were cured, 23 improved, 9 uncured and 11 died. There were 47 cases (42.0%) with poor prognosis, they had abnormal head imageology, severe complications and some cases died, 13 of 18 (72.2%) patients with meningitis caused by Streptococcus died. CONCLUSION: Escherichia coli, CNS and Streptococcus are the predominant pathogens responsible for neonatal purulent meningitis over the past ten years. There were increasing numbers of cases with Streptococcus meningitis which are more common in early onset meningitis with adverse outcome, therefore careful attention should be paid in clinic. Linezolid should be used as a new choice in intractable neonatal purulent meningitis cases caused by gram positive bacteria.
TI  - New antimicrobial contact catalyst killing antibiotic resistant clinical and waterborne pathogens.
AB  - Microbial growth on medical and technical devices is a big health issue, particularly when microorganisms aggregate to form biofilms. Moreover, the occurrence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the clinical environment is dramatically growing, making treatment of bacterial infections very challenging. In search of an alternative, we studied a novel antimicrobial surface coating based on micro galvanic elements formed by silver and ruthenium with surface catalytic properties. The antimicrobial coating efficiently inhibited the growth of the nosocomial pathogens Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium as demonstrated by the growth inhibition on agar surface and in biofilms of antibiotic resistant clinical E. faecalis, E. faecium, and S. aureus isolates. It also strongly reduced the growth of Legionella in a drinking water pipeline and of Escherichia coli in urine. We postulate a mode of action of the antimicrobial material, which is independent of the release of silver ions. Thus, the novel antimicrobial coating could represent an alternative to combat microbial growth avoiding the toxic side effects of high levels of silver ions on eukaryotic cells.
TI  - Whole-genome mapping of 5' RNA ends in bacteria by tagged sequencing: a comprehensive view in Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - Enterococcus faecalis is the third cause of nosocomial infections. To obtain the  first snapshot of transcriptional organizations in this bacterium, we used a modified RNA-seq approach enabling to discriminate primary from processed 5' RNA ends. We also validated our approach by confirming known features in Escherichia coli. We mapped 559 transcription start sites (TSSs) and 352 processing sites (PSSs) in E. faecalis. A blind motif search retrieved canonical features of SigA- and SigN-dependent promoters preceding transcription start sites mapped. We discovered 85 novel putative regulatory RNAs, small- and antisense RNAs, and 72 transcriptional antisense organizations. Presented data constitute a significant insight into bacterial RNA landscapes and a step toward the inference of regulatory processes at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels in a comprehensive manner.
TI  - Chronic bacterial seminal vesiculitis as a potential disease entity in men with chronic prostatitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate bacterial infection in the seminal vesicles by bacteriological examination and radionuclide imaging in men with chronic prostatitis. METHODS: The study included 50 patients with chronic prostatitis who showed hot uptake in seminal vesicles on Tc-99 m ciprofloxacin imaging and eight patients who did not show hot uptake. The evaluation included the National Institutes of Health Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index and four-glass test. In all participants, transperineal aspiration of seminal vesicle fluid under the guidance of transrectal ultrasonography and bacteriological examination was carried out. RESULTS: Of the 50 patients who showed hot uptake in the seminal vesicles on the isotope study, microorganisms were isolated from the seminal vesicle fluid in 17 patients (positive predictive value, 34%). The most common causative organisms were Escherichia coli in 13 patients (26%), followed by coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species in two patients (4%), Enterococcus faecalis in one patient (2%) and Chlamydia trachomatis in one patient (2%). No microorganisms were isolated in the eight patients who did not show hot uptake in the seminal vesicles (negative predictive value, 100%). However, there were no significant differences in National Institutes of Health Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index total scores and subscores between the study groups. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic bacterial seminal vesiculitis might simultaneously affect a considerable portion of patients with chronic prostatitis, although the clinical implication of the disease remains to be further investigated.
TI  - Validation of a novel rinse and filtration method for efficient processing of fresh produce samples for microbiological indicator enumeration.
AB  - Several methods have been described to prepare fresh produce samples for microbiological analysis, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. The aim of this study was to compare the performance of a novel combined rinse and membrane filtration method to two alternative sample preparation methods for the quantification of indicator microorganisms from fresh produce. Decontaminated cantaloupe melons and jalapeno peppers were surface inoculated with a cocktail containing 10(6) CFU/ml Escherichia coli, Salmonella Typhimurium, and Enterococcus faecalis. Samples were processed using a rinse and filtration method, homogenization by stomacher, or a sponge-rubbing method, followed by quantification of bacterial load using culture methods. Recovery efficiencies of the three methods were compared. On inoculated cantaloupes, the rinse and filtration method had higher recovery of coliforms (0.95 log CFU/ml higher recovery, P = 0.0193) than the sponge-rubbing method. Similarly, on inoculated jalapenos, the rinse and filtration method had higher recovery for coliforms (0.84 log CFU/ml higher, P = 0.0130) and E. coli (1.46 log CFU/ml higher, P < 0.0001) than the sponge-rubbing method. For jalapenos, the rinse and filtration method outperformed the homogenization method for all three indicators (0.79 to 1.71 log CFU/ml higher, P values ranging from 0.0075 to 0.0002). The precision of the three methods was also compared. The precision of the rinse and filtration method was similar to that of the other methods for recovery of two of three indicators from cantaloupe (E. coli P = 0.7685, E. faecalis P = 0.1545) and was more precise for recovery of two of three indicators from jalapeno (coliforms P = 0.0026, E. coli P = 0.0243). Overall, the rinse and filtration method performed equivalent to, and sometimes better than, either of the compared methods. The rinse and filtration method may have logistical advantages when processing large numbers of samples, improving sampling efficiency and facilitating microbial detection.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial and cytotoxic effects of Anacardium occidentale and Mangifera indica in oral care.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Oral health is an integral and important component of general health. Infectious diseases such as caries, periodontal, and gingivitis indicate the onset of imbalance in homeostasis between oral micro biota and host. The present day medicaments used in oral health care have numerous side effects. The uses of herbal plants as an alternative have gained popularity due to side effects of antibiotics and emergence of multidrug resistant strains. Anacardium occidentale (cashew) and Mangifera indica (mango) have been used as traditional oral health care measures in India since time immemorial. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The ethanol extracts of cashew and mango leaves were obtained by maceration method. The antimicrobial activity was evaluated by clear zone produced by these plant extracts against Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans, Escherichia coli, and Candida albicans in agar plate method, determination of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), minimum bactericidal/fungicidal concentration (MBC/MFC), and suppression of biofilm. The cytotoxic effects of plants extract was determined by microculture tetrazolium assay on human gingival fibroblast and Chinese hamster lung fibroblast (V79) cell lines. RESULTS: Cashew and mango leaf extract significantly (P < 0.05) produced larger zone of inhibition against test pathogens when compared to povidone-iodine-based mouth rinses. Although the MIC and MBC/MFC values of mouth rinses were effective in lower concentrations; plant extracts significantly (P < 0.001) suppressed the biofilms of oral pathogens. The leaf extracts were less cytotoxic (P < 0.001) compared to mouth rinses. CONCLUSIONS: Plant extracts are superior to the mouth rinses and have a promising role in future oral health care.
TI  - Nonselective mevalonate kinase inhibitor as a novel class of antibacterial agents.
AB  - Introduction. There are a few evidences about targeting isoprenoids biosynthesis  pathway in bacteria for finding new antibiotics. This study was conducted to assess antibacterial effects of vanadyl sulfate (VS), one of the mevalonate kinase inhibitors to find a new target for killing bacteria. Materials and Methods. Antibacterial effect of VS alone and in combination with glycine or EDTA was assessed on Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa as Gram-negative and Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis as Gram-positive bacteria using serial dilution method and minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) identified. Result. MICs for S. aureus and E. coli were 4 and 8 mg/mL, respectively. VS could not affect the growth of two other bacteria. However, VS in combination with glycine not only inhibited the growth of E. faecalis and P. aeruginosa, but also reduced MICs for VS-sensitive bacteria (S. aureus and E. coli). EDTA could reduce MIC for E. coli and P. aeruginosa. Conclusion. VS could inhibit the growth of S. aurous and E. coli, and adding glycine or EDTA improved VS antibacterial activity presumably via instability of the cell wall and enhanced transport of VS through bacterial cell wall. Inhibition of the isoprenoid pathway might provide new tools to overcome bacterial resistance.
TI  - Tridentate hydrazone metal complexes derived from cephalexin and 2-hydrazinopyridine: synthesis, characterization and antibacterial activity.
AB  - Metal(II) coordination compounds of a tridentate hydrazone ligand (HL) derived from the condensation of cephalexin antibiotic with 2-hydrazinopyridine were synthesized. The hydrazone ligand and mononuclear [ML(OAc)(H2O)] (M(II)=Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ag) complexes were characterized by several techniques, including elemental and thermal analysis, molar conductance and magnetic susceptibility measurements, electronic, FT-IR, EPR and (1)H NMR spectral studies. The cephalexin 2-pyridinylhydrazone ligand HL behaves as a monoanionic tridentate NNO chelating agent. The biological applications of complexes have been studied on three bacteria strains (Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter baumannii and Enterococcus faecalis) by agar diffusion disc method.
TI  - Antimicrobial and Antifungal Activity of Pelargonium roseum Essential Oils.
AB  - PURPOSE: The antiseptic qualities of aromatic and medicinal plants and their extracts have been recognized since antiquity, while attempts to characterize these properties in the laboratory date back the beginning of the XX(th) century. In the current study essential oils obtained from Pelargonium roseum (Geraniacea) were analyzed for their antibacterial and antifungal activities. METHODS: The antimicrobial activity of the Pelargonium essential oil was tested against Gram-negative bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli), Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis) and fungi (Candida albicans). Disc diffusion method was used to study antimicrobial activity. RESULTS: Inhibition zones showed that the studied essential oils were active against all of the studied bacteria. In the case of Candida albicans, the complete inhibition of the fungus's development was observed. In the cases of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus we observed an inhibition comparable to that obtained by the use of an appropriate antimicrobial substance. CONCLUSION: The volatile oils exhibited considerable inhibitory effects against all the organisms under test, in some cases comparable with those of the reference antibiotics. There were no considerable differences between the antimicrobial activities of the oil obtained by distillation and commercially available Pelargonium oils.
TI  - Antimicrobial peptides expressed in medicinal maggots of the blow fly Lucilia sericata show combinatorial activity against bacteria.
AB  - The larvae of the common green bottle fly (Lucilia sericata) produce antibacterial secretions that have a therapeutic effect on chronic and nonhealing wounds. Recent developments in insect biotechnology have made it possible to use these larvae as a source of novel anti-infectives. Here, we report the application of next-generation RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) to characterize the transcriptomes of the larval glands, crop, and gut, which contribute to the synthesis of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and proteins secreted into wounds. Our data confirm that L. sericata larvae have adapted in order to colonize microbially contaminated habitats, such as carrion and necrotic wounds, and are protected against infection by a diverse spectrum of AMPs. L. sericata AMPs include not only lucifensin and lucimycin but also novel attacins, cecropins, diptericins, proline-rich peptides, and sarcotoxins. We identified 47 genes encoding putative AMPs and produced 23 as synthetic analogs, among which some displayed activities against a broad spectrum of microbial pathogens, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus vulgaris, and Enterococcus faecalis. Against Escherichia coli (Gram negative) and Micrococcus luteus (Gram positive), we found mostly additive effects but also synergistic activity when selected AMPs were tested in combination. The AMPs that are easy to synthesize are currently being produced in bulk to allow their evaluation as novel anti-infectives that can be formulated in hydrogels to produce therapeutic wound dressings and adhesive bandages.
TI  - Probiotic potential of lactobacillus strains isolated from sorghum-based traditional fermented food.
AB  - Sorghum-based traditional fermented food was screened for potential probiotic lactic acid bacteria. The isolates were identified by biochemical, physiological and genetic methods. Species identification was done by 16s rRNA sequence analysis. The functional probiotic potential of the two Lactobacillus species viz., Lactobacillus plantarum (Lact. plantarum) and Lactobacillus pentosus (Lact. pentosus) was assessed by different standard parameters. The strains were tolerant to pH 2 for 1 h and resistant to methicillin, kanamycin, vancomycin and norfloxacin. Two (Lact. plantarum COORG-3 and Lact. pentosus COORG-8) out of eight isolates recorded the cell surface hydrophobicity to be 59.12 and 64.06 %, respectively. All the strains showed tolerance to artificial duodenum juice (pH 2) for 3 h, positive for bile salt hydrolase test and negative for haemolytic test. The neutralized cell-free supernatant of the strains Lact. pentosus COORG-4, Lact. plantarum COORG-1, Lact. plantarum COORG-7, Lact. pentosus COORG-8 and Lact. plantarum COORG-3 showed good antibiofilm activity. Lact. pentosus COORG-8 exhibited 74 % activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa-MTCC 7903 and Lact. plantarum COORG-7 showed 68 % inhibition of biofilm against Klebsiella pneumonia MTCC 7407. Three (Lact. plantarum COORG-7, Lact. pentosus COORG-5 and Lact. pentosus COORG 8) out of eight isolates exhibited a good antimicrobial activity against Listeria monocytogenes and five isolates (Lact. pentosus COORG 2, Lact. plantarum COORG 1, Lact. plantarum COORG 4, Lact. pentosus COORG 3 and Lact. plantarum COORG 6) are active against Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumonia, Enterococcus faecalis. The study also evaluated the cholesterol lowering property of the Lactobacillus strains using hen egg yolk as the cholesterol source. The cholesterol in hen egg yolk was assimilated by 74.12 and 68.26 % by Lact. plantarum COORG 4 and Lact. pentosus COORG 7, respectively. The results of the present study suggest that the Lactobacillus strains isolated and characterized from sorghum-based fermented product may be used as probiotic strains for therapeutic applications.
TI  - Bactericidal Activity and Mechanism of Photoirradiated Polyphenols against Gram-Positive and -Negative Bacteria.
AB  - The bactericidal effect of various types of photoirradiated polyphenols against Gram-positive and -negative bacteria was evaluated in relation to the mode of action. Gram-positive bacteria (Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus mutans) and Gram-negative bacteria (Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) suspended in a 1 mg/mL polyphenol aqueous solution (caffeic acid, gallic acid, chlorogenic acid, epigallocatechin, epigallocatechin gallate, and proanthocyanidin) were exposed to LED light (wavelength, 400 nm; irradiance, 260 mW/cm2) for 5 or 10 min. Caffeic acid and chlorogenic acid exerted the highest bactericidal activity followed by gallic acid and proanthocyanidin against both Gram-positive and -negative bacteria. It was also demonstrated that the disinfection treatment induced oxidative damage of bacterial DNA, which suggests that polyphenols are incorporated into bacterial cells. The present study suggests that blue light irradiation of polyphenols could be a novel disinfection treatment.
TI  - Utilization of blood cultures in Danish hospitals: a population-based descriptive analysis.
AB  - This national population-based study was conducted as part of the development of  a national automated surveillance system for hospital-acquired bacteraemia and ascertains the utilization of blood cultures (BCs). A primary objective was to understand how local differences may affect interpretation of nationwide surveillance for bacteraemia. From the Danish Microbiology Database, we retrieved all BCs taken between 2010 and 2013 and linked these to admission data from the National Patient Registry. In total, 4 587 295 admissions were registered, and in 11%, at least one BC was taken. Almost 50% of BCs were taken at admission. The chance of having a BC taken declined over the next days but increased after 4 days of admission. Data linkage identified 876 290 days on which at least one BC was taken; 6.4% yielded positive results. Ten species, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, Enterobacter cloacae and Klebsiella oxytoca, accounted for 74.7% of agents for this purpose classified as pathogenic. An increase in BCs and positive BCs was observed over time, particularly among older patients. BCs showed a seasonal pattern overall and for S. pneumoniae particularly. A predominance of male patients was seen for bacteraemias due to S. aureus, E. faecium and K. pneumoniae. Minor differences in BCs and positive BCs between departments of clinical microbiology underpin the rationale of a future automated surveillance for bacteraemia. The study also provides important knowledge for interpretation of surveillance of invasive infections more generally.
TI  - Evaluation of antibacterial and antifungal activity of new calcium-based cement (Biodentine) compared to MTA and glass ionomer cement.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the antibacterial and antifungal properties of calcium-based cement, Biodentine (Ca3SiO2), compared to commercial glass ionomer cements (GICs) and mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pellets of GICs, ProRoot MTA, and Biodentine were prepared to test the influence of these cements on the growth of four oral microbial strains: Streptococcus mutans, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, and Candida albicans; using agar diffusion method. Wells were formed by removing the agar and the manipulated materials were immediately placed in the wells. The pellets were lodged in seeded plates and the growth inhibition diameter around the material was measured after 24-72 h incubation at 37 degrees C. The data were analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) test to compare the differences among the three cements at different concentrations. RESULTS: Test indicates that the antimicrobial activity of Biodentine, on all the microorganisms tested, was very strong, showing a mean inhibition zone of 3.2 mm, which extends over time towards all the strains. For Biodentine, GIC, and MTA, the diameters of the inhibition zones for S. mutans were significantly larger than for E. faecalis, Candida, and E. coli (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: All materials showed antimicrobial activity against the tested strains except for GIC on Candida. Largest inhibition zone was observed for Streptococcus group. Biodentine created larger inhibition zones than MTA and GIC.
TI  - Chemical composition and antibacterial activities of seven Eucalyptus species essential oils leaves.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In this paper, we have studied the essential oils chemical composition of the leaves of seven Eucalyptus species developed in Tunisia. Eucalyptus leaves were picked from trees growing in different arboretums in Tunisia. Choucha and Mrifeg arboretums located in Sedjnene, region of Bizerte (Choucha: E. maideni, E. astrengens et E. cinerea; Mrifeg : E. leucoxylon), Korbous arboretums located in the region of Nabeul, North East Tunisia with sub-humid bioclimate, (E. lehmani), Souiniet-Ain Drahem arboretum located in region of Jendouba (E. sideroxylon, E. bicostata). Essential oils were individually tested against a large panel of microorganisms including Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 6539), Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC29212), Listeria ivanovii (RBL 30), Bacillus cereus (ATCC11778). RESULTS: The yield of essential oils ranged from 1.2% to 3% (w/w) for the different Eucalyptus species. All essential oils contain alpha-pinene, 1,8-cineol and pinocarveol-trans for all Eucalyptus species studied. The 1,8-cineol was the major compound in all species (49.07 to 83.59%). Diameter of inhibition zone of essential oils of Eucalyptus species varied from 10 to 29 mm. The largest zone of inhibition was obtained for Bacillus cereus (E. astrengens) and the lowest for Staphylococcus aureus (E. cinerea). The essential oils from E. maideni, E. astrengens, E. cinerea (arboretum of Bizerte), E. bicostata (arboretum of Aindraham) showed the highest antibacterial activity against Listeria ivanovii and Bacillus cereus. CONCLUSION: The major constituents of Eucalyptus leaves essential oils are 1,8-cineol (49.07 to 83.59%) and alpha-pinene (1.27 to 26.35%). The essential oils from E. maideni, E. astrengens, E. cinerea, E. bicostata showed the highest antibacterial activity against Listeria ivanovii and Bacillus cereus, they may have potential applications in food and pharmaceutical products.
TI  - Extraction, characterization and antimicrobial activity of sulfated polysaccharides from fish skins.
AB  - Sulfated polysaccharides were extracted from gray triggerfish (GTSP) and smooth hound (SHSP) skins. Their chemical and physical characteristics were determined using X-ray diffraction and Infrared spectroscopic analysis. The antibacterial activities of GTSP and SHSP against Listeria monocytogenes (ATCC 43251), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923), Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29212), Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), Salmonella enterica (ATCC 43972) and Enterobacter sp were evaluated by determining clear growth inhibition zone diameters and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values and by essays in liquid media. GTSP and SHSP were fractionated by a Diethylaminoethyl-cellulose chromatography. Fraction FGII, from GTSP, and fraction FSII, from SHSP, showed the most important inhibitory effects against the tested bacterial species. The sulfated polysaccharides from fish skins did not show hemolytic activity towards bovine erythrocytes. Overall, the results suggested that those polysaccharides could offer promising sources of polysaccharides for future application as dietary ingredients in the nutraceutical industry.
TI  - Diagnostic and therapeutic utility of transrectal ultrasound in urological office prostatic abscess management: a short report from a single urologic center.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Prostatic abscess (PA) is an infrequent condition in the modern antibiotic era. The everyday use of transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) during diagnostic work-up and the widespread recurrence to prostatic biopsies may lead to an increase of PA diagnosis. In this short report we analyze the patients characteristics and the management of seven recent cases of PA diagnosed in our institution. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The records of 7 patients admitted to our Center for LUTS associated to septic fever or acute urinary retention, was prospectively collected. Suspect of PA was done on digital rectal examination (DRE) and confirmed by TRUS performed after urinary system ultrasound (UUS) evaluation. Patients were admitted to hospital only in case of septic signs. A sovrapubic (SPC) or urethral catheter (UC) was placed depending on symptoms. A TRUS-guided aspiration of PA was performed with patient in lithotomic position, using a 18 gauge two-part needle, side/end fire needle access. Patient was discharged with antibiotic therapy and followed up until complete resolution of the PA and symptoms. RESULTS: Mean age was 62 years (range 24-82). Two patients were diabetics and one was affected by the immunodeficiency acquired syndrome (HIV). In one case, PA was detected after a persistent fever post TRUS guided prostate biopsy. Average prostate volume was 69 ml (range 19-118 ml). DRE was able to diagnose PA only in 2 cases (29%), UUS evaluation in 1 case (14%). All cases were confirmed by TRUS as hypo-anechoic areas with or without internal echoes in all patients. Mean PA dimension was 3.64 cm (range 1.5-8). SPC was placed in 3 cases (43%), UC in 3 patients (43%). Only 1 patient refused catheterization. Side fire needle aspiration was performed in all cases and in combination with end fire access in case of particular location of abscess cavities. Second look was needed in 2 cases (29%). Antibiotics were administered in all cases. The aspirated pus showed a positive culture for Escherichia coli (43%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (29%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (14%) and Enterococcus faecalis (14%). PA resolution time mean was 9 days (range 3-24). CONCLUSIONS: TRUS evaluation in case of persistent LUTS associated with fever or acute urinary retention is determinant in the diagnosis of PA. Office or institutional management with TRUS needle aspiration is a good option in these cases.
TI  - Optimizing supercritical carbon dioxide in the inactivation of bacteria in clinical solid waste by using response surface methodology.
AB  - Clinical solid waste (CSW) poses a challenge to health care facilities because of the presence of pathogenic microorganisms, leading to concerns in the effective sterilization of the CSW for safe handling and elimination of infectious disease transmission. In the present study, supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO2) was applied to inactivate gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis, and gram-negative Escherichia coli in CSW. The effects of SC-CO2 sterilization parameters such as pressure, temperature, and time were investigated and optimized by response surface methodology (RSM). Results showed that the data were adequately fitted into the second-order polynomial model. The linear quadratic terms and interaction between pressure and temperature had significant effects on the inactivation of S. aureus, E. coli, E. faecalis, and B. subtilis in CSW. Optimum conditions for the complete inactivation of bacteria within the experimental range of the studied variables were 20 MPa, 60 degrees C, and 60 min. The SC-CO2-treated bacterial cells, observed under a scanning electron microscope, showed morphological changes, including cell breakage and dislodged cell walls, which could have caused the inactivation. This espouses the inference that SC-CO2 exerts strong inactivating effects on the bacteria present in CSW, and has the potential to be used in CSW management for the safe handling and recycling-reuse of CSW materials.
TI  - Direct Detection and Quantification of Bacterial Genes Associated with Inflammation in DNA Isolated from Stool.
AB  - Although predominantly associated with health benefits, the gut microbiota has also been shown to harbor genes that promote inflammation. In this work, we report a method for the direct detection and quantification of these pro-inflammatory bacterial genes by PCR and qPCR in DNA extracted from human stool samples. PCR reactions were performed to detect (i) the pks island genes, (ii) tcpC, which is present in some strains of Escherichia coli and (iii) gelE presented in some strains of Enterococcus faecalis. Additionally, we screened for the presence of the following genes encoding cyclomodulins that disrupted mammalian cell division: (iv) cdt (which encodes the cytolethal distending toxin) and (v) cnf-1 (which encodes the cytotoxic necrotizing factor-1). Our results show that 20% of the samples (N = 41) tested positive for detectable amounts of pks island genes, whereas 10% of individuals were positive for tcpC or gelE and only one individual was found to harbor the cnf-1 gene. Of the 13 individuals that were positive for at least one of the pro-inflammatory genes, 5 were found to harbor more than one. A quantitative version of the assay, which used real-time PCR, revealed the pro-inflammatory genes to be in high copy numbers: up to 1.3 million copies per mg of feces for the pks island genes. Direct detection of specific genes in stool could prove useful toward screening for the presence of pro-inflammatory bacterial genes in individuals with inflammatory bowel diseases or colorectal cancer.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of extracts and isoquinoline alkaloids of selected papaveraceae plants.
AB  - Alkaloidal extracts of seven selected plants of the family Papaveraceae were studied with respect to their activity against six strains of pathogenic bacteria and their alkaloidal fingerprint. Twenty-four alkaloids were determined by GC/MS, and twenty of them identified from their mass spectra, retention times and retention indexes. In the antibacterial assay, three Gram-positive (Enterorococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus and S. hyicus), and three Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) strains were used. The most promising antimicrobial activity was shown by the alkaloidal extract of Macleaya cordata with MIC values of 16 mug/mL for Staphylococcus aureus, 32 mug/mL for Enterococcus faecalis and 64 mug/mL for Staphylococcus hyicus and Escherichia coli. All the tested pure isoquinoline alkaloids were considered inactive within the tested concentrations.
TI  - Synthesis of silver nanoparticles using Solanum trilobatum fruits extract and its antibacterial, cytotoxic activity against human breast cancer cell line MCF 7.
AB  - In the present study, we have synthesized silver nanoparticles by a simple and eco-friendly method using unripe fruits of Solanum trilobatum. The aqueous silver ions when exposed to unripe fruits extract were reduced and stabilized over long time resulting in biosynthesis of surface functionalized silver nanoparticles. The bio-reduced silver nanoparticles were characterized by UV-visible spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDX) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). These biologically synthesized silver nanoparticles were tested for its antibacterial activity against few human pathogenic bacteria including Gram-positive (Streptococcus mutans, Enterococcus faecalis) and Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae) bacteria. In addition, we also demonstrated anticancer activity of these nanoparticles in vitro against human breast cancer cell line (MCF 7) using MTT, nuclear morphology assay, Western blot and RT-PCR expression. These results taken together show the potential applications of biosynthesized silver nanoparticles using S. trilobatum fruits.
TI  - Oxidative stress and antibacterial properties of a graphene oxide-cystamine nanohybrid.
AB  - Oxidative stress can damage proteins, DNA, and lipids, and is involved in the progression of many diseases. Damage to infected cells caused by oxidative stress is related to increased levels of reactive oxygen species, including hydrogen peroxide. During oxidative stress, hydrogen peroxide levels are often increased and catalase level decreased inside cells. This can lead to the death of skin and other cells. Hydrophobic low molecular weight compounds are useful in treating hemorrhagic conditions of the skin. To this end, cystamine has been successfully conjugated with graphene oxide (GO) as a drug carrier. The current study used the microdilution method to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations of cystamine-conjugated GO against four types of pathogenic bacteria. Minimum inhibitory concentrations values were 1 mug/mL against Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium, 6 mug/mL against Enterococcus faecalis, and 4 mug/mL against Bacillus subtilis. Toxicity of the conjugate against squamous cell carcinoma 7 cells was minimal at low concentrations, but increased in a dose-dependent manner. These results demonstrated that our protocol produced a cystamine-conjugated GO with low cytotoxicity, but strong reactive oxygen species effects and high antibacterial activity. This nanohybrid may be useful in the treatment of dermatological disorders. Moreover, this class of nanohybrid may have other biomedical applications due to their low cytotoxicity and high antibacterial activity.
TI  - [The urinary bacterial flora in patients with cutaneous ureterostomy].
AB  - Twenty-four patients with cutaneous ureterostomy at least 6 months after surgery  were included in this study. Single-J ureteral catheters were indwelt in 7 patients. Pouch urine was cultured and analyzed from asymptomatic patients and from those with pyelonephritis. Forty-eight bacterial strains were isolated from asymptomatic patients. Thirty-five of these strains consisting of 18 species were isolated from the patients without ureteral catheters. Enterococcus (E.) faecalis (20.0%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (11.4%) and Proteus (P.) mirabilis (11. 4%) were isolated at high frequency. One methicilline-resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (MRCNS) strain was isolated. Thirteen bacterial strains consisting of 8 species were isolated from the patients with ureteral catheters. E. faecalis (23.1%), Eschericia (E.) coli (23.1%) and Pseudomonas (P.) aeruginosa (15.4%) were isolated at high frequency. One E. coli strain harboring extended-spectrum beta lactamase (ESBL) and one MRCNS strain were isolated. Pyelonephritis occurred in 5 patients 14 times during follow-up for at least 6 months after surgery. The patients with ureteral catheters suffered from pyelonephritis (4/7, 57.1%) more frequently as compared to the patients without catheters (1/17, 5.9%) (p = 0.014). P. aeruginosa (26.9%), E. faecium (15.4%), and P. mirabilis (11.5%) were isolated inhigh frequency. One E. coli strain harboring ESBL and one P. mirabilis strain harboring ESBL were isolated. In conclusion, insertion of ureteral catheters in a cutaneous ureterostomy is a strong risk factor for pyelonephritis and development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Therefore, urine culture is important in these patients who are under surveillance.
TI  - In vitro spectrum of pexiganan activity when tested against pathogens from diabetic foot infections and with selected resistance mechanisms.
AB  - Pexiganan, a 22-amino-acid synthetic cationic peptide, is currently in phase 3 clinical trials as a topical antimicrobial agent for the treatment of mild infections associated with diabetic foot ulcers. Bacterial isolates from the 2013 SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program designated as pathogens from diabetic foot infections (DFI) and Gram-negative and -positive pathogens from various infection types that harbored selected resistance mechanisms/phenotypes were tested against pexiganan in reference cation-adjusted Mueller-Hinton broth. The MIC50 and MIC90 against all organisms tested from DFI were 16 and 32 mug/ml, respectively. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter koseri, Enterobacter cloacae, Acinetobacter species, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa MIC values ranged from 8 to 16 mug/ml. Pexiganan MIC values among Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-resistant S. aureus [MRSA] and methicillin-susceptible S. aureus [MSSA]), beta-hemolytic streptococci, and Enterococcus faecium ranged from 8 to 32 mug/ml. Pexiganan activity was not adversely affected for members of the family Enterobacteriaceae or P. aeruginosa that produced beta-lactamases or resistance mechanisms to other commonly used antimicrobial agents. Decreased susceptibility to vancomycin did not affect pexiganan activity against S. aureus or E. faecium. Enterococcus faecalis appears to be intrinsically less susceptible to pexiganan (MIC, 32 to 256 mug/ml). The "all organism" MIC90 of 32 mug/ml for pexiganan in this study was >250-fold below the pexiganan concentration in the cream/delivery vehicle being developed for topical use.
TI  - Risk factors analysis for occurrence of asymptomatic bacteriuria after endourological procedures.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Endourological procedures are performed according to the principles of aseptic techniques, jet still in certain number of patients urinary tract infections may occur. Considering the risk of urinary tract infection, there is no unique opinion about the prophylactic use of antibiotics in endourological procedures. GOAL: The objective of this study was to determine the connection between endourological procedures and occurrence of urinary infections and to analyze the risk factors of urinary infection for patients who were hospitalized at the Urology Clinic of the Clinical Center University of Sarajevo CCUS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The research was conducted as a prospective study on a sample of 208 patients of both genders, who were hospitalized at the Urology Clinic of the CCUS and to whom some endourological procedure was indicated for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes. We analyzed data from patient's histories of illness, laboratory tests taken at admission and after endourological procedures, also surgical programs for endoscopic procedures. All patients were clinically examined prior to endoscopic procedures while after the treatment attention was focused to the symptoms of urinary tract infections. RESULTS: Statistical analysis of the tested patients indicates that there is no significant difference in the presence of postoperative, compared to preoperative bacteriuria, which implies that the endourological procedures are safe procedures in terms of urinary tract infections. Preoperatively, the most commonly isolated bacteria was Escherichia coli (30.9%) and postoperatively, Enterococcus faecalis (25%). Statistically significant effect on the occurrence of postoperative bacteriuria has preoperative bacteriuria, duration of postoperative catheterization, and duration of hospitalization. CONCLUSION: In everyday urological practice, it is very important to identify and control risk factors for the development of urinary infection after endourological procedures, with main objective to minimize occurrence of infectious complications.
TI  - Drug resistance and molecular epidemiology of aerobic bacteria isolated from puerperal infections in bangladesh.
AB  - Puerperal infection is a common complication during postnatal period in developing countries. Bacterial species, drug resistance, and genetic characteristics were investigated for a total of 470 isolates from puerperal infections in Bangladesh for a 2-year period (2010-2012). The most common species was Escherichia coli (n=98), followed by Enterococcus faecalis (n=54), Staphylococcus haemolyticus (n=33), Proteus mirabilis (n=32), Staphylococcus aureus (n=27), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=22), and Enterobacter cloacae (n=21). S. aureus and Acinetobacter baumannii were isolated at a higher frequency from wound infections after cesarean section, while E. coli, E. cloacae, and K. pneumoniae were isolated from community-acquired endometritis and urinary tract infections. Resistance to third-generation cephalosporins was frequent for Enterobacteriacae, and was mainly mediated by blaCTX-M-1 group beta-lactamases. The CTX-M gene in E. coli from the four phylogroups was identified as blaCTX-M-15, and phylogroup B2 isolates with blaCTX-M-15 were classified into ST131 with O25b allele, harboring aac(6')-Ib-cr and various virulence factors. Carbapenemase genes blaNDM-1 and blaNDM-7 were identified in one isolate each of phylogroup A E. coli. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus isolates had type IV or V SCCmec, including isolates of ST361 (CC672), which is related to an emerging ST672 clone in the Indian subcontinent. This study revealed the recent epidemiological status of aerobic bacteria causing puerperal infections in Bangladesh, providing useful information to improve clinical practice and infection control.
TI  - Nanobioarchitectures based on chlorophyll photopigment, artificial lipid bilayers and carbon nanotubes.
AB  - In the last decade, building biohybrid materials has gained considerable interest in the field of nanotechnology. This paper describes an original design for bionanoarchitectures with interesting properties and potential bioapplications. Multilamellar lipid vesicles (obtained by hydration of a dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine thin film) with and without cholesterol were labelled with a natural photopigment (chlorophyll a), which functioned as a sensor to detect modifications in the artificial lipid bilayers. These biomimetic membranes were used to build non-covalent structures with single-walled carbon nanotubes. Different biophysical methods were employed to characterize these biohybrids such as: UV-vis absorption and emission spectroscopy, zeta potential measurements, AFM and chemiluminescence techniques. The designed, carbon-based biohybrids exhibited good physical stability, good antioxidant and antimicrobial properties, and could be used as biocoating materials. As compared to the cholesterol-free samples, the cholesterol-containing hybrid structures demonstrated better stability (i.e., their zeta potential reached the value of -36.4 mV), more pronounced oxygen radical scavenging ability (affording an antioxidant activity of 73.25%) and enhanced biocidal ability, offering inhibition zones of 12.4, 11.3 and 10.2 mm in diameter, against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis, respectively.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of prodigiosin isolated from Serratia marcescens UFPEDA 398.
AB  - Prodigiosin is an alkaloid and natural red pigment produced by Serratia marcescens. Prodigiosin has antimicrobial, antimalarial and antitumor properties and induces apoptosis in T and B lymphocytes. These properties have piqued the interest of researchers in the fields of medicine, pharmaceutics and different industries. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of prodigiosin against pathogenic micro-organisms. The red pigments produced by S. marcescens exhibited absorption at 534 nm, Rf of 0.59 and molecular weight of 323 m/z. Antimicrobial activity was tested against oxacillin-resistant Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Acinetobacter sp. and oxacillin-resistant S. aureus. The standard antibiotics employed were ampicillin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin and oxacillin. The disc-diffusion tests demonstrated significant inhibition zones for S. aureus (35 +/- 0.6), E. faecalis (22 +/- 1.0) and S. pyogenes (14 +/- 0.6). However, prodigiosin showed resistance to E. coli, P. aeruginosa and acinetobacter, where no significant formation of inhibitory halos were observed. We determined the inhibitory minimum concentrations and bactericidal for 20 strains of oxacillin-resistant S. aureus (ORSA). The pattern was the antibiotic oxacillin. The minimum inhibitory concentrations observed ranged from 1, 2 and 4.0 mug/mL, respectively, while the minimum bactericidal concentrations ranged from 2, 4, 8 and 16 mug/mL. The S. marcescens prodigiosin produced by showed bactericidal and bacteriostatic effect showing promising antimicrobial activity and suggesting future studies regarding its applicability in antibiotics therapies directed ORSA.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and its susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents--special references to bacteria isolated between April 2010 and March 2011].
AB  - Bacteria isolated from surgical infections during the period from April 2010 to March 2011 were investigated in a multicenter study in Japan, and the following results were obtained. In this series, 631 strains including 25 strains of Candida spp. were isolated from 170 (81.7%) of 208 patients with surgical infections. Four hundred and twenty two strains were isolated from primary infections, and 184 strains were isolated from surgical site infection. From primary infections, anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria were predominant, followed by aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, while from surgical site infection aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant, followed by anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria. Among aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Enterococcus spp. such as Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, and Enterococcus avium was highest, followed by Streptococcus spp. such as Streptococcus anginosus and Staphylococcus spp. such as Staphylococcus aureus, in this order, from primary infections, while Enterococcus spp. such as E. faecalis and E. faecium was highest, followed by Staphylococcus spp. such as S. aureus from surgical site infection. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in this order, and from surgical site infection, E. coli and R aeruginosa were most predominantly isolated, followed by E. cloacae and K. pneumoniae. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rates of Parvimonas micra, Eggerthella lenta, Streptococcus constellatus, Gemella morbillorum, and Collinsella aerofaciens were the highest from primary infections, and the isolation rate from surgical site infection was generally low. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of Bilophila wadsworthia was the highest from primary infections, followed by, Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides ovatus, and from surgical site infection, B. fragilis was most predominantly isolated, followed by Bacteroides thetaiotaomnicron, in this order. In this series, vancomycin-resistant MRSA (methicillin-resistant S. aureus), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp. and multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa were not observed.
TI  - New role for human alpha-defensin 5 in the fight against hypervirulent Clostridium difficile strains.
AB  - Clostridium difficile infection (CDI), one of the most common hospital-acquired infections, is increasing in incidence and severity with the emergence and diffusion of hypervirulent strains. CDI is precipitated by antibiotic treatment that destroys the equilibrium of the gut microbiota. Human alpha-defensin 5 (HD5), the most abundant enteric antimicrobial peptide, is a key regulator of gut microbiota homeostasis, yet it is still unknown if C. difficile, which successfully evades killing by other host microbicidal peptides, is susceptible to HD5. We evaluated, by means of viability assay, fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis, and electron microscopy, the antimicrobial activities of alpha-defensins 1 and 5 against a panel of C. difficile strains encompassing the most prevalent epidemic and hypervirulent PCR ribotypes in Europe (012, 014/020, 106, 018, 027, and 078). Here we show that (i) concentrations of HD5 within the intestinal physiological range produced massive C. difficile cell killing; (ii) HD5 bactericidal activity was mediated by membrane depolarization and bacterial fragmentation with a pattern of damage peculiar to C. difficile bacilli, compared to commensals like Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis; and (iii) unexpectedly, hypervirulent ribotypes were among the most susceptible to both defensins. These results support the notion that HD5, naturally present at very high concentrations in the mucosa of the small intestine, could indeed control the very early steps of CDI by killing C. difficile bacilli at their germination site. As a consequence, HD5 can be regarded as a good candidate for the containment of hypervirulent C. difficile strains, and it could be exploited in the therapy of CDI and relapsing C. difficile-associated disease.
TI  - Syntheses, structures, and antimicrobial activity of new remarkably light-stable  and water-soluble tris(pyrazolyl)methanesulfonate silver(I) derivatives of N-methyl-1,3,5-triaza-7-phosphaadamantane salt - [mPTA]BF4.
AB  - Two new silver(I) complexes of formula [Ag(mPTA)4](Tpms)4(BF4) (1) and [Ag(Tpms)(mPTA)](BF4) (2) (mPTA = N-methyl-1,3,5-triaza-7-phosphaadamantane cation, Tpms = tris(pyrazol-1-yl)methanesulfonate anion) have been synthesized and fully characterized by elemental analyses, (1)H and (31)P{(1)H} NMR, ESI-MS, and IR spectroscopic techniques. The single-crystal X-ray diffraction study of 1 discloses a noncoordinated nature of the Tpms species, existing as counterions around the highly charged metal center [Ag(mPTA)](5+), 1 being the first reported coordination compound bearing a kappa(0)-Tpms. 1 features high solubility and stability in water (S25 degrees C approximately 30 mg.mL(-1)). The two complexes interact with calf thymus DNA via intercalation mode, binding to the BSA with decrease of its tryptophan fluorescence with a static quenching mechanism. The two new silver complexes exhibit significant antibacterial and antifungal activities screened in vitro against the standard strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Candida albicans.
TI  - Effects of the probiotic Enterococcus faecium NCIMB 10415 on selected lactic acid bacteria and enterobacteria in co-culture.
AB  - Enterococcus faecium NCIMB 10415 is used as a probiotic for piglets and has been  shown to modify the porcine intestinal microbiota. However, the mode of action of this probiotic modification is still unclear. One possible explanation is the direct growth inhibiting or stimulating effect of the probiotic on other indigenous bacteria. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to examine the growth interactions of the probiotic with different indigenous porcine bacteria in vitro. Reference strains were cultivated with the probiotic E. faecium strain NCIMB10415 (SF68) in a checkerboard assay with 102 to 105 cells/ml inoculum per strain. Growth kinetics were recorded for 8 h and used to determine specific growth of the co-cultures. Additionally, total DNA was extracted from the co-cultures at the end of the incubation to verify which strain in the co-culture was affected. Co-cultivation with eight Enterococcus spp. tester strains showed strain-specific growth differences. Three of four E. faecium strains were not influenced by the probiotic strain. PCR results showed reduced growth of the probiotic strain in co-culture with E. faecium DSM 6177. Three of four Enterococcus faecalis strains showed reduced specific growth in co-culture with the probiotic strain. However, E. faecalis DSM 20478 impaired growth of the probiotic E. faecium strain. The growth of Lactobacillus johnsonii DSM 10533 and Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 20016 was enhanced in co-culture with the probiotic strain, but co-cultivations with Lactobacillus mucosae DSM13345 or Lactobacillus amylovorus DSM10533 showed no differences. Co-cultures with the probiotic E. faecium showed no impact on the growth rate of four different enterobacterial reference strains (2 strains of Salmonella enterica and 2 strains of Escherichia coli), but PCR results showed reduced cell numbers for a pathogenic E. coli isolate at higher concentration of the probiotic strain. As the in vitro effect of the probiotic E. faecium on enterococci was strain specific and the growth of certain Lactobacillus spp. was enhanced by the probiotic, these results indicate a direct effect of the probiotic on certain members of the porcine gastro intestinal microbiota.
TI  - Antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of alcoholic extracts obtained from vegetative organs of A. retroflexus.
AB  - In vitro antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of Amaranthus retroflexus leaves and inflorescence alcoholic (ethanol 70%) extracts of various concentrations ranging from 0.78 to 400 muL/ml were analyzed on different clinical and reference bacterial strains (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtills, Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii) and fungal strains (Candida albicans, C. famata, C. utilis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae) using agar disk diffusion method and broth dilution method (MIC determination) for antimicrobial activity and TEAC (Trolox capacity) assay for the evaluation of the antioxidant activity. The adapted diffusion method was used to test the antimicrobial effect of the extracts separately and in combination with a range of standard antibiotics, in order to evidence any synergic effects of A. retroflexus extracts on the antibiotics activity. The extracts showed the highest inhibitory effect against K. pneumoniae and B. subtilis with no activity against S. aureus among the bacterial strains, while in case of the fungal strains the most intensive effect was exhibited against C. famata by both extracts. The A. retroflexus leaves extract improved the ciprofloxacin and ticarcillin-clavulanic acid activity towards the P. aeruginosa clinical strain. The inflorescences extract significantly increased chloramphenicol activity on B. subtilis strain. The antioxidant activity assay showed that the studied extracts exhibited the ability to neutralize the free radicals leading to the conclusion that the tested extracts bear compounds with a broad spectrum of antimicrobial and antioxidant activity that could represent a potential alternative for treating various infectious diseases.
TI  - [Clinical efficacy of the antimicrobial drug furamag in nosocomial urinary tract  infections].
AB  - AIM: To evaluate the efficacy of the combined drug furamag (furasidine potassium  and magnesium hydroxycarbonate) in combination with the third-generation cephalosporin cefotaxime versus cephalosporin monotherapy for nosocomial urinary tract infections (NUTI). SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The randomized open-label comparative parallel group clinical trial enrolled 52 male and female patients aged over 18 years with a documented diagnosis of NUTI. Group 1 (a study group) took oral furamag 300 mg/day in combination with intravenous cefotaxime 6 g/day; Group 2 (a control group) received cefotaxime monotherapy. The duration of therapy in both groups was 7 to 10 days until the efficiency levels were achieved. RESULTS: A final efficiency analysis was made in 24 and 25 patients from Groups 1 and 2 who had different forms of NUTI (catheter-associated NUTI, cystitis, pyelonephritis). On day 3 of treatment, most patients were noted to have a decreased systemic inflammatory response; lower C-reactive protein and procalcitonin levels being in the study group patients. The clinical efficiency of antibacterial therapy, which had been evaluated both immediately after treatment termination and during further control, did not substantially differ in the furamag/cefotaxime combination and control groups although there was an obvious tendency towards the more marked effect of combined therapy 7-14 days after treatment (11.8% efficiency differences; p>0.05). Analysis of bacteriological efficacy revealed its most pronounced and clinically significant differences between the groups: the cefotaxime/furamag combination led to higher pathogen eradication in all follow-up periods: after 3 days of treatment (82.6%) and following a complete therapy cycle (95.8%) versus the cefotaxime monotherapy group (43.5 and 70.8%, respectively; p<0.01). Microbiological results showed that the major NUTI pathogens (Escherichia coli, enterococci) were more susceptible to potassium furasidine (furamag) versus cefotaxime. The in vitro higher activity of furamag versus cefotaxime was attended by the significantly higher eradication of one of the two important NUTI pathogens - Enterococcus faecalis. CONCLUSION: Furamag used in combination with the third-generation cephalosporin cefotaxime showed a higher bacteriological efficacy and a rapider reduction in the symptoms of a systemic inflammatory response in patients with NUTI. On the basis of the findings, the above combination of furamag and cefotaxime may be recommended as first-line therapy for NUTI when multidrug- resistant nosocomial infection pathogens are widely distributed now.
TI  - Epidemiology and antibiotic susceptibility of aerococci in urinary cultures.
AB  - In this study, we present population-based data regarding the prevalence of aerococci in clinical urinary samples. During a 3-month period, all aerococcal isolates from urinary samples from 2 clinical microbiology laboratories were collected. We identified 64 Aerococcus urinae isolates and 40 Aerococcus sanguinicola isolates, which correlates with an incidence of 33 cases of aerococcal bacteriuria per 100,000 inhabitants per year. The median age was 83years for all patients with aerococcal bacteriuria, which was significantly higher than for patients with Escherichia coli or Enterococcus faecalis bacteriuria. Sex was almost equally distributed between men and women with aerococcal bacteriuria, whereas females dominated in E. coli bacteriuria. The aerococcal isolates displayed low MICs for ampicillin, cefalotin, mecillinam, and nitrofurantoin. Most A. sanguinicola isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin, whereas most A. urinae isolates had low MICs. Clinical studies are needed to establish clinical breakpoints and optimal treatment.
TI  - Removal of total and antibiotic resistant bacteria in advanced wastewater treatment by ozonation in combination with different filtering techniques.
AB  - Elimination of bacteria by ozonation in combination with charcoal or slow sand filtration for advanced sewage treatment to improve the quality of treated sewage and to reduce the potential risk for human health of receiving surface waters was investigated in pilot scale at the sewage treatment plant Eriskirch, Baden-Wuerttemberg/Germany. To determine the elimination of sewage bacteria, inflowing and leaving wastewater of different treatment processes was analysed in a culture-based approach for its content of Escherichia coli, enterococci and staphylococci and their resistance against selected antibiotics over a period of 17 month. For enterococci, single species and their antibiotic resistances were identified. In comparison to the established flocculation filtration at Eriskirch, ozonation plus charcoal or sand filtration (pilot-scale) reduced the concentrations of total and antibiotic resistant E. coli, enterococci and staphylococci. However, antibiotic resistant E. coli and staphylococci apparently survived ozone treatment better than antibiotic sensitive strains. Neither vancomycin resistant enterococci nor methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) were detected. The decreased percentage of antibiotic resistant enterococci after ozonation may be explained by a different ozone sensitivity of species: Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis, which determined the resistance-level, seemed to be more sensitive for ozone than other Enterococcus-species. Overall, ozonation followed by charcoal or sand filtration led to 0.8-1.1 log-units less total and antibiotic resistant E. coli, enterococci and staphylococci, as compared to the respective concentrations in treated sewage by only flocculation filtration. Thus, advanced wastewater treatment by ozonation plus charcoal or sand filtration after common sewage treatment is an effective tool for further elimination of microorganisms from sewage before discharge in surface waters.
TI  - Physicochemical and biological properties of oxovanadium(IV), cobalt(II) and nickel(II) complexes with oxydiacetate anions.
AB  - The potentiometric and conductometric titration methods have been used to characterize the stability of series of VO(IV)-, Co(II)- and Ni(II)-oxydiacetato complexes in DMSO-water solutions containing 0-50 % (v/v) DMSO. The influence of DMSO as a co-solvent on the stability of the complexes as well as the oxydiacetic acid was evaluated. Furthermore, the reactivity of the complexes towards superoxide free radicals was assessed by employing the nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT) assay. The biological properties of the complexes were investigated in relation to their cytoprotective activity against the oxidative damage generated exogenously by using hydrogen peroxide in the Human Dermal Fibroblasts adult (HDFa) cell line as well as to their antimicrobial activity against the bacteria (Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis). The relationship between physicochemical and biological properties of the complexes was discussed.
TI  - Integration of non-oral bacteria into in vitro oral biofilms.
AB  - Biofilms are polymicrobial communities that grow on surfaces in nature. Oral bacteria can spontaneously form biofilms on the surface of teeth, which may compromise the health of the teeth, or their surrounding (periodontal) tissues. While the oral bacteria exhibit high tropism for their specialized ecological niche, it is not clear if bacteria that are not part of the normal oral microbiota can efficiently colonize and grow within oral biofilms. By using an in vitro "supragingival" biofilm model of 6 oral species, this study aimed to investigate if 3 individual bacterial species that are not part of the normal oral microbiota (Eschericia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecails) and one not previously tested oral species (Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans) can be incorporated into this established supragingival biofilm model. Staphylococcus aureus and A. actinomycetemcomitans were able to grow efficiently in the biofilm, without disrupting the growth of the remaining species. They localized in sparse small aggregates within the biofilm mass. Enterococcus faecalis and E. coli were both able to populate the biofilm at high numbers, and suppressed the growth of A. oris and S. mutants. Enterococcus faecalis was arranged in a chain-like conformation, whereas E. coli was densely and evenly spread throughout the biofilm mass. In conclusion, it is possible for selected species that are not part of the normal oral microbiota to be introduced into an oral biofilm, under the given experimental micro-environmental conditions. Moreover, the equilibrated incorporation of A. actinomycetemcomitans and S. aureus in this oral biofilm model could be a useful tool in the study of aggressive periodontitis and peri-implantitis, in which these organisms are involved, respectively.
TI  - Biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles using ethanolic petals extract of Rosa indica and characterization of its antibacterial, anticancer and anti-inflammatory activities.
AB  - The present study was aimed at biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) using ethanolic extract of rose (Rosa indica) petals and testing their potential antibacterial activity using selective human pathogenic microbes, anticancer activity using human colon adenocarcinoma cancer cell line HCT 15 as well as anti-inflammatory activity using rat peritoneal macrophages in vitro. The biologically synthesized AgNPs were also characterized by UV-visible spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The characterized AgNPs showed an effective antibacterial activity against Gram negative (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae) than Gram positive (Streptococcus mutans, Enterococcus faecalis) bacteria. MTT assay, analysis of nuclear morphology, mRNA expression of Bcl-2, Bax and protein expression of caspase 3 as well as 9, indicated potential anticancer activity. In addition, green synthesized AgNPs also attenuated cytotoxicity, nuclear morphology and free radical generation (O2(-) and NO) by rat peritoneal macrophages in vitro. The results of our study show the potential green synthesis of silver nanoparticles in mitigating their toxicity while retaining their antibacterial activities.
TI  - The use of the replication region of plasmid pRS7 from Oenococcus oeni as a putative tool to generate cloning vectors for lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - A chimeric plasmid, pRS7Rep (6.1 kb), was constructed using the replication region of pRS7, a large plasmid from Oenococcus oeni, and pEM64, a plasmid derived from pIJ2925 and containing a gene for resistance to chloramphenicol. pRS7Rep is a shuttle vector that replicates in Escherichia coli using its pIJ2925 component and in lactic acid bacteria (LAB) using the replication region of pRS7. High levels of transformants per microg of DNA were obtained by electroporation of pRS7Rep into Pediococcus acidilactici (1.5 x 10(7)), Lactobacillus plantarum (5.7 x 10(5)), Lactobacillus casei (2.3 x 10(5)), Leuconostoc citreum (2.7 x 10(5)), and Enterococcus faecalis (2.4 x 10(5)). A preliminary optimisation of the technical conditions of electrotransformation showed that P. acidilactici and L. plantarum are better transformed at a later exponential phase of growth, whereas L. casei requires the early exponential phase for better electrotransformation efficiency. pRS7Rep contains single restriction sites useful for cloning purposes, BamHI, XbaI, SalI, HincII, SphI and PstI, and was maintained at an acceptable rate (>50%) over 100 generations without selective pressure in L. plantarum, but was less stable in L. casei and P. acidilactici. The ability of pRS7Rep to accept and express other genes was assessed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the replication region of a plasmid from O. oeni has been used to generate a cloning vector.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of different filling pastes for deciduous tooth treatment.
AB  - Guedes-Pinto paste is the filling material most employed in Brazil for endodontic treatment of deciduous teeth; however, the Rifocort(R) ointment has been removed. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the antimicrobial potential of filling pastes, by proposing three new pharmacological associations to replace Rifocort(R) ointment with drugs of already established antimicrobial power: Nebacetin(R) ointment, 2% Chlorhexidine Gluconate gel, and Maxitrol(R) ointment. A paste composed of Iodoform, Rifocort(R) ointment and Camphorated Paramonochlorophenol (CPC) was employed as the gold standard (G1). The other associations were: Iodoform, Nebacetin(R) ointment and CPC (G2); Iodoform, 2% Chlorhexidine Digluconate gel and CPC (G3); Iodoform, Maxitrol(R) ointment and CPC (G4). The associations were tested for Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans), Streptococcus oralis (S. oralis), Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis), Escherichia coli (E. coli), and Bacillus subtilis (B. subtilis), using the methods of dilution on solid medium - orifice agar - and broth dilution. The results were tested using statistical analysis ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis. They showed that all the pastes had a bacteriostatic effect on all the microorganisms, without any statistically significant difference, compared with G1. S. aureus was statistically significant (multiple comparison test of Tukey), insofar as G2 and G3 presented the worst and the best performance, respectively. All associations were bactericidal for E. coli, S. aureus, S. mutans and S. oralis. Only G3 and G4 were bactericidal for E. faecalis, whereas no product was bactericidal for B. subtilis. Thus, the tested pastes have antimicrobial potential and have proved acceptable for endodontic treatment of primary teeth.
TI  - Isolation and identification of symbiotic bacteria from the skin, mouth, and rectum of wild and captive tree shrews.
AB  - Endosymbionts influence many aspects of their hosts' health conditions, including physiology, development, immunity, metabolism, etc. Tree shrews (Tupaia belangeri chinensis) have attracted increasing attention in modeling human diseases and therapeutic responses due to their close relationship with primates. To clarify the situation of symbiotic bacteria from their body surface, oral cavity, and anus, 12 wild and 12 the third generation of captive tree shrews were examined. Based on morphological and cultural characteristics, physiological and biochemical tests, as well as the 16S rDNA full sequence analysis, 12 bacteria strains were isolated and identified from the wild tree shrews: body surface: Bacillus subtilis (detection rate 42%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (25%), Staphlococcus aureus (33%), S. Epidermidis (75%), Micrococcus luteus (25%), Kurthia gibsonii (17%); oral cavity: Neisseria mucosa (58%), Streptococcus pneumonia (17%); anus: Enterococcus faecalis (17%), Lactococus lactis (33%), Escherichia coli (92%), Salmonella typhosa (17%); whereas, four were indentified from the third generation captive tree shrews: body surface: S. epidermidis (75%); oral cavity: N.mucosa (67%); anus: L. lactis (33%), E. coli (100%). These results indicate that S. epidermidis, N. mucosa, L. lactis and E. coli were major bacteria in tree shrews, whereas, S. aureus, M. luteus, K. gibsonii, E. faecalis and S. typhosa were species-specific flora. This study facilitates the future use of tree shrews as a standard experimental animal and improves our understanding of the relationship between endosymbionts and their hosts.
TI  - Stable synthetic mono-substituted cationic bacteriochlorins mediate selective broad-spectrum photoinactivation of drug-resistant pathogens at nanomolar concentrations.
AB  - Three stable synthetic mono-substituted cationic bacteriochlorins (BC37, BC38 and BC39) were recently reported to show exceptional activity (low nanomolar) in mediating photodynamic killing of human cancer cells after a 24h incubation upon excitation with near-infrared light (730 nm). The presence of cationic quaternary ammonium groups in each compound suggested likely activity as antimicrobial photosensitizers. Herein this hypothesis was tested against a panel of pathogenic microorganisms that have all recently drawn attention due to increased drug-resistance (Gram-positive bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis; Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli and Acinetobacter baumannii; and fungal yeasts, Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans). All three bacteriochlorins were highly effective against both Gram-positive species (>6 logs of eradication at 200 nM and 10 J/cm(2)). The dicationic bacteriochlorin (BC38) was best against the Gram-negative species (>6 logs at 1-2 muM) whereas the lipophilic monocationic bacteriochlorin (BC39) was best against the fungi (>6 logs at 1 muM). The bacteriochlorins produced substantial singlet oxygen (and apparently less Type-1 reactive-oxygen species such as hydroxyl radical) as judged by activation of fluorescent probes and comparison with 1H-phenalen-1-one-2-sulfonic acid; the order of activity was BC37 > BC38 > BC39. A short incubation time (30 min) resulted in selectivity for microbial cells over HeLa human cells. The highly active photodynamic inactivation of microbial cells may stem from the amphiphilic and cationic features of the bacteriochlorins.
TI  - Bicistronic mRNAs to enhance membrane protein overexpression.
AB  - Functional overexpression of membrane proteins is essential for their structural  and functional characterization. However, functional overexpression is often difficult to achieve, and frequently either no expression or expression as misfolded aggregates is observed. We present an approach for improving the functional overexpression of membrane proteins in Escherichia coli using transcriptional fusions. The method involves the use of a small additional RNA sequence upstream to the RNA sequence of the target membrane protein and results in the production of a bicistronic mRNA. In contrast to the common approach of translational fusions to enhance protein expression, transcriptional fusions do not require protease treatment and subsequent removal of the fusion protein. Using this strategy, we observed improvements in the quantity and/or the quality of the produced material for several membrane proteins to levels compatible with structural studies. Our analysis revealed that translation of the upstream RNA sequence was not essential for increased expression. Rather, the sequence itself had a large impact on protein yields, suggesting that alternative folding of the transcript was responsible for the observed effect.
TI  - Synthesis, antibacterial, antioxidant activity and QSAR studies of novel 2-arylidenehydrazinyl-4-arylthiazole analogues.
AB  - A novel series of 2-arylidenehydrazinyl-4-arylthiazole analogues (3a-p) was designed and synthesized in excellent yields using a rapid, simple, efficient methodology. Sixteen novel compounds were screened for in vitro antimicrobial activities against eleven bacteria, namely, Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis, Klebsiella pneumonia, Citrobacter freundii, Cronobacter sakazakii, Salmonella enteritidis, Escherichia coli, Yersinia pestis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. All 16 compounds showed significant anti-bacterial activities against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. In particular, compound 3g showed potent inhibition of E. coli and K. pneumonia, compound 3i inhibited E. faecalis, compound 3n S. tythi and E. faecalis, and compound 3c E. coli and C. sakazakii. In fact, our results indicate that most of the compounds synthesized exhibit strong antibacterial activity. The qualitative structure-antibacterial activity relationships (QSAR) were studied using the physicochemical and quantum-chemical parameters of the ab initio Hartree-Fock model at the RHF/6-31G level of theory. A good qualitative correlation between predicted physicochemical parameters (log P and polar surface area (PSA)) and antibacterial activity has been found. The synthesized compounds were also evaluated for antioxidant activity. Compounds 3j, 3a and 3i exhibited the greatest antioxidant activity, with IC50 values of 0.66, 0.81, and 1.08 microM, respectively, which were comparable to that of ascorbic acid (IC50 0.87 microM). The promising antibacterial and antioxidant activities of some of these synthesized 2-arylidenehydrazinyl-4-arylthiazole derivatives, together with the results of quantum-chemical studies, could be helpful for the development of drugs to combat diseases caused by microorganisms and oxidative stress.
TI  - Antimicrobial and immunomodulatory properties of PGLa-AM1, CPF-AM1, and magainin-AM1: potent activity against oral pathogens.
AB  - Cationic amphipathic alpha-helical peptides are intensively studied classes of host defence peptides (HDPs). Three peptides, peptide glycine-leucine-amide (PGLa-AM1), caerulein-precursor fragment (CPF-AM1) and magainin-AM1, originally isolated from norepinephrine-stimulated skin secretions of the African volcano frog Xenopus amieti (Pipidae), were studied for their antimicrobial and immunomodulatory activities against oral and respiratory pathogens. Minimal effective concentrations (MECs), determined by radial diffusion assay, were generally lower than minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) determined by microbroth dilution. PGLa-AM1 and CPF-AM1 were particularly active against Streptococcus mutans and all three peptides were effective against Fusobacterium nucleatum, whereas Enterococcus faecalis and Candida albicans proved to be relatively resistant micro-organisms. A type strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was shown to be more susceptible than the clinical isolate studied. PGLa-AM1 displayed the greatest propensity to bind lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Escherichia coli, P. aeruginosa and Porphyromonas gingivalis. All three peptides showed less binding to P. gingivalis LPS than to LPS from the other species studied. Oral fibroblast viability was unaffected by 50 muM peptide treatments. Production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-8 by oral fibroblasts was significantly increased following treatment with 1 or 10 muM magainin-AM1 but not following treatment with PGLa-AM1 or CPF-AM1. In conclusion, as well as possessing potent antimicrobial actions, the X. amieti peptides bound to LPS from three human pathogens and had no effect on oral fibroblast viability. CPF-AM1 and PGLa-AM1 show promise as templates for the design of novel analogues for the treatment of oral and dental diseases associated with bacteria or fungi.
TI  - Enhanced free fatty acid production by codon-optimized Lactococcus lactis acyl-ACP thioesterase gene expression in Escherichia coli using crude glycerol.
AB  - Fatty acid production and composition are determined by the type of acyl-acyl carrier protein thioesterases (acyl-ACP TEs) expressed in Escherichia coli. Bacterial acyl-ACP TEs from Lactococcus lactis (SGJS47), Enterococcus faecalis (SGJS49), and Burkholderia cepacia (SGJS50) were codon-optimized and expressed in E. coli for enhanced fatty acid production. Samples were extracted at the lag, log, and stationary phases of cell growth, and gene expression levels of the codon optimized acy-ACP TEs as well as fatty acid production were monitored. At 24h after initiation of gene expression, the OPLlTE expression level and fatty acid production in SGJS47 increased up to 15.8-fold and 3.2-fold compared to the control and other recombinant strains, respectively. Additionally, in SGJS47, improvement in free fatty acid (FFA) composition, high-specificity production of short-chain fatty acids (C8, C10) and unsaturated fatty acids (C16:1) was achieved in crude glycerol medium condition. Compared with control strain, the percentage of FFAs (C8 and C10) was enhanced by approximately 16- to 21-fold, C16:1 FFA ratio increased approximately 18-fold. Observation of codon-optimized acyl-ACP TE genes expression level in E. coli may be useful for understanding mechanisms towards improving fatty acid production. Engineered strains have the potential to overproduce specific FFAs and thereby reduce the cost of fatty acid production by using industrially inexpensive carbon sources.
TI  - The question of pathogen quantification in disinfected graywater.
AB  - Graywater (GW) reuse for irrigation is recognized as a sustainable solution for water conservation. One of the major impediments to GW reuse is the presence of pathogenic microorganisms. This study monitored three similar on-site GW treatment systems bi-monthly over the course of a year to compare the presence of pathogens and indicators in raw, biologically treated, and biologically treated and disinfected [by chlorine and ultraviolet light (UV)] GW. The systems were designed to allow the testing of the same batch (collection) of water as it passed through the treatment chain. The samples were analyzed using standard culture-dependent methods and the data were compared to culture-independent DNA-based methods. Results suggested that the presence and abundance of fecal coliforms, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, Enterococcus spp., Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa differ among the various GW streams (e.g. raw, biologically treated, and disinfected). The culture-dependent analyses suggested that both chlorine and UV inactivate most of the bacteria tested in the biologically treated GW, albeit at different efficiencies. Conversely, the DNA-based analyses indicated no significant differences in pathogenic bacterial abundance between the biologically treated GW with or without disinfection. To better understand the discrepancies between the results, we repeated the analysis in the laboratory under controlled conditions using Enterococcus faecalis as a model bacterium and obtained similar results. We suggest that disinfection of biologically treated GW with chlorine or UV is effective for treating pathogens, but that the inactivation efficiency cannot be estimated by DNA-based qPCR.
TI  - In-vitro screening of Malaysian honey from different floral sources for antibacterial activity on human pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Different researches on therapeutic effects of honey have been conducted in different regions; however the study on the potential antibacterial activity of Malaysian honey is still limited. In this study, antibacterial activities of different monofloral honey samples were tested against several common human pathogenic bacteria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The well-diffusion method, minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) techniques were employed to investigate the putative antibacterial activity of Malaysian monofloral honey from Koompassia excelsa (Becc.) Taub (Tualang), Melaleuca cajuputi Powell (Gelam) and Durio zibethinus Murr. (Durian). Honey samples were tested against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC6518 and ATCC25923, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC12228, Enterococcus faecium LMG16192, Enterococcus faecalis LMG16216 and ATCC29212, Escherichia coli ATCC25922, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium ATCC14028 and Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC13883. RESULTS: Marked variations were observed in the antibacterial activity of these honey samples. Durian honey failed to produce substantial antibacterial activity, whereas Tualang and Gelam honey showed a spectrum of antibacterial activity with their growth inhibitory effects against all of the tested bacterial species including vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). CONCLUSION: Present findings suggested Gelam honey possesses highest antibacterial effect among the tested Malaysian honey samples.
TI  - Pharmacological basis for the medicinal use of Linum usitatissimum (Flaxseed) in  infectious and non-infectious diarrhea.
AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Linum usitatissimum, commonly known as Flaxseed has traditionally been used for the management of diarrhea and gastrointestinal infections. This study was planned to assess pharmacological basis for the medicinal use of Flaxseed in infectious and non-infectious diarrhea. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The crude aqueous-methanolic extract of Flaxseed was studied using the in vivo castor oil-induced diarrhea, gut motility and enteropooling assays. Mechanistic basis was further elucidated by testing the inhibitory effect on spontaneously contracting isolated rabbit jejunum preparations, suspended in a 10ml tissue bath containing Tyrode solution, maintained at 37 degrees C and aerated with carbogen. Antibacterial efficacy of the Flaxseed extract was tested against different enteric and non-enteric pathogenic bacteria using in vitro antibacterial assays. RESULTS: Flaxseed extract reduced the diarrheal score in mice, by 39%, 63.90% and 68.34% at the respective doses of 100, 300 and 500mg/kg. Intestinal secretions were reduced by 24.12%, 28.09% and 38.80%, whereas the intestinal motility was reduced by 31.66%, 46.98% and 56.20% at respective doses of 100, 300 and 500mg/kg. When tested on isolated rabbit jejunum preparations, Flaxseed extract produced a dose-dependent inhibition of both spontaneous and high K(+) (80mM)-induced contractions, and shifted the concentration-response curves of Ca(++) to the right with suppression of the maximum response, similar to that caused by verapamil. Flaxseed extract was found to possess bactericidal activity at the tested concentrations of 12.5mg/ml, against vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (100%), Escherichia coli K1 (88.88%), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (98.76%), Bacillus cereus (92.64%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (76.83%) and Salmonella typhi (26.91+/-3.35%). The concentration of 10mg/ml showed bactericidal effects against all the aforementioned pathogens except Escherichia coli K1, whereas for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella typhi, it was bacteriostatic at this concentration. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that Linum usitatissimum (Flaxseed) extract exhibits antidiarrheal and antispasmodic activities by virtue of its antimotility and antisecretory effects which are mediated possibly through inhibition of Ca(++) channels, though additional mechanism(s) cannot be ruled out. Flaxseed extract proved effective against both enteric and non-enteric pathogens causing diarrhea, thus ensuring wide coverage and rationalizing its medicinal use in both the infectious and non-infectious diarrhea.
TI  - Antimicrobial bioassay-guided fractionation of a methanol extract of Eupatorium triplinerve.
AB  - CONTEXT: Eupatorium triplinerve Vahl (Asteraceae), popularly known as Japana, is  widely used in folk medicine, due its analgesic, anticoagulant, antianorexic, antiparasitic, anthelmintic, sedative, antifungal, and antibacterial properties. OBJECTIVE: The present study evaluated the chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of E. triplinerve extracts from different parts of the plant and identified the extract with the highest antimicrobial potential. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Extracts were obtained by maceration of all parts of plant, and subjected to bioassay-guided fractionation of methanol extract by partition column chromatography. The major chemical groups, saponins, reducing sugars, alkaloids, steroids, triterpenoids, phenols, tannins, flavonoids, and others were screened by standard techniques. The antimicrobial activity of the different extracts was performed by microdilution assay and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) values were reported. RESULTS: Phytochemical screening of hydroalcoholic extract from all parts of E. triplinerve identified mainly steroids, coumarins, alkaloids, saponins, tannins, depsides and absence of polysaccharides and flavonoids. The methanol extract of leaves presented the highest content of coumarins and lower MIC values of 62 and 75 microg/mL against Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus, respectively. In addition, its non-polar fractions showed antimicrobial activity with MIC ranging from 16 to 125 microg/mL against Gram-negative bacteria, mainly Escherichia coli. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Data showed that non-polar fractions of E. triplinerve methanolic extract has better antimicrobial activity and most likely depends on the presence of several compounds, such as depsidones, coumarins, saponins, and triterpenes on crude extract. The results can be exploited largely in research of new antibacterial agents.
TI  - In vitro activity of heather [Calluna vulgaris (L.) Hull] extracts on selected urinary tract pathogens.
AB  - Calluna vulgaris L. Hull (Ericaceae) has been used for treatment of urinary tract infections in traditional medicine. In this study we analyzed in vitro antibacterial activity of the plant extracts on different strains of Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis and Proteus vulgaris, as well as the concentrations of total phenols and flavonoids in the extracts. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) were determined. The concentrations of total phenols were examined by using Folin-Ciocalteu reagent and ranged between 67.55 to 142.46 mg GAE/g. The concentrations of flavonoids in extracts were determined using spectrophotometric method with aluminum chloride and the values ranged from 42.11 to 63.68 mg RUE/g. The aqueous extract of C. vulgaris showed a significant antibacterial activity. The values of MIC were in the range from 2.5 mg/ml to 20 mg/ml for this extract. Proteus vulgaris strains were found to be the most sensitive. The results obtained suggest that all tested extracts of C. vulgaris inhibit the growth of human pathogens, especially the aqueous extract.
TI  - Blood stream infections in renal transplant recipients: a single-center study.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Bacteremias among renal transplant recipients are more frequent as  a result of immunosuppression. They are considered extremely high-risk because they are correlated with decreased allograft and recipient survival. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All episodes of bacteremia among renal transplant recipients were documented following review of medical records, from January 2010 to May 2013. RESULTS: In total 26 episodes of bacteremia were observed in 22 patients. Gram negative bacteremia was identified in 73% (19/26) cases. Pathogens according to their frequency were the following Escherichia coli (6/26, 23%), Klebsiella pneumonia (5/26, 19%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (3/26, 11%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (3/26, 11%), Acinetobacter baumanni (2/26, 7.7%), Enterococcus faecalis (2/26, 7.7%). The first trimester post renal transplantation 18 episodes (69%) of bacteremia were presented that were not correlated to indwelling urinary catheter or stent. Positive urinary culture with the same pathogen was recognized in 13 patients. All recipients manifested fever, eight recipients had leucocytosis and three cases were complicated by septic shock. Immediate resuscitation with intravenous fluids and non-nephrotoxic antibiotic regimen was initiated. Acute renal allograft dysfunction (defined as an increase in serum creatinine more than 0.5 mg/dL from baseline) was observed in five patients and was restored following infection resolution. CONCLUSION: Increased prevalence of bacteremia in renal transplant recipients is attributed to immunosuppression and usually bacteremic episodes follow urinary tract infection. The commonest pathogens are Gram negative bacteria with E. coli the most frequent. Early detection and proper management are important as bacteremia affects renal allograft and recipient survival.
TI  - Estimation of cultivable bacterial diversity in the cloacae and pharynx in Eurasian griffon vultures (Gyps fulvus).
AB  - In this work, we describe the biodiversity of cloacal and pharynx culture-based bacteria (commensal and pathogenic), in 75 Eurasian griffon vultures (Gyps fulvus) from two geographic areas. We address the question of whether the cultivable microbiota of vultures is organised into assemblages occurring by chance. In addition, we assess bacterial diversity in both anatomic regions and geographic areas. Bacterial diversity was represented by 26 Gram-negative and 20 Gram-positive genera. The most common genera were Escherichia, Enterococcus, Staphylococcus, Clostridium and Lactococcus. Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis were the most common species in cloacal and pharyngeal samples. Staphylococcus and Erysipelothrix were isolated from the pharynx and Salmonella and Corynebacterium from the cloacae, and no Campylobacter was isolated from the cloacal swabs. Ten cloacal swabs were positive for Salmonella, of which five isolates were Salmonella enterica serotype 4,(5),12:i:-, one isolate was S. enterica serotype Derby, three isolates were S. enterica serotype 61:k:1,5,7 and one isolate was S. enterica serotype Infantis. The null modelling approach revealed that the commensal bacteria of vultures are not structured in assemblages. On the other hand, differences in bacterial genus and species richness between cloacal and pharyngeal samples or between geographic areas were clear, with the pharynx in vultures from both geographic areas being richer. The results of this study indicate also that vultures can serve as a reservoir of certain pathogenic zoonotic bacteria. The dissemination of these zoonotic pathogens in wildlife could be prevented by periodic sanitary surveys.
TI  - Comparative prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in community-acquired urinary  tract infection cases from representative States of northern and southern India.
AB  - CONTEXT: Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are amongst the most common infections described in outpatient settings. Increased antimicrobial resistance (AMR) of urinary tract pathogens is a matter of global public health concern. Treatment of UTI depends on both prevalence and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) of causative bacteria at any specific geographical location. AIM: This study was undertaken to compare the prevalence of uropathogens and their AMR profile in two different geographical parts of India. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Clean-catch mid-stream urine samples were collected from adult patients, bacterial flora isolated from human urine was evaluated for antimicrobial susceptibility profile using Kirby Bauer's disc diffusion method among patients from Hyderabad (Southern India), Rajasthan and Punjab (Northern India). The data were analysed using Chi-square (chi2) test, confidence interval (CI), odds ratio (OR) analysis and p-value using SPSS 16 software. RESULTS: Escherichia coli (55.1%) were the most prevalent isolates followed by Enterococcus faecalis (15.8%). Amikacin was the most active antimicrobial agents which showed low resistance rate of 14%. The present study revealed the geographical difference in prevalence of uropathogens with Klebsiella pneumoniae being the second most common uropathogen followed by E. faecalis in the states from northern India while no K. pneumoniae was seen in samples from southern India but E. faecalis was the second most prevalent organism. CONCLUSION: Therefore, development of regional surveillance programs is highly recommended for implementation of national CA-UTI guidelines in Indian settings.
TI  - Aerobic bacterial microbiota isolated from the cloaca of the European pond turtle (Emys orbicularis) in Poland.
AB  - We conducted a comparative analysis of the aerobic cloacal bacteria of European pond turtles (Emys orbicularis) living in their natural environment and juvenile turtles reared under controlled conditions in a breeding center. We included 130 turtles in the study. The aerobic bacteria isolated from the cloaca of the juvenile turtles were less diverse and more prevalent than the bacteria isolated from free-living adults. We isolated 17 bacterial species from juvenile captive turtles, among which the dominant species were Cellulomonas flavigena (77/96), Enterococcus faecalis (96/96), Escherichia coli (58/96), and Proteus mirabilis (41/96). From the adult, free-living turtles, we isolated 36 bacterial species, some of which are a potential threat to public health (e.g., Salmonella enterica serovars Newport, Daytona, and Braenderup; Listeria monocytogenes; Yersinia enterocolitica; Yersinia ruckeri; Klebsiella pneumoniae; Vibrio fluvialis; and Serratia marcescens), and pathogens that are etiologic agents of diseases of ectothermic animals (e.g., Aeromonas sobria, Aeromonas caviae, Hafnia alvei, Edwardsiella tarda, and Citrobacter braakii; the last two species were isolated from both groups of animals). The cloacal bacterial biota of the European pond turtle was characterized by numerous species of bacteria, and its composition varied with turtle age and environmental conditions. The small number of isolated bacteria that are potential human pathogens may indicate that the European pond turtle is of relatively minor importance as a threat to public health.
TI  - Identification of peptidoglycan-associated proteins as vaccine candidates for enterococcal infections.
AB  - Infections by opportunistic bacteria have significant contributions to morbidity  and mortality of hospitalized patients and also lead to high expenses in healthcare. In this setting, one of the major clinical problems is caused by Gram-positive bacteria such as enterococci and staphylococci. In this study we extract, purify, identify and characterize immunogenic surface-exposed proteins present in the vancomycin resistant enterococci (VRE) strain Enterococcus faecium E155 using three different extraction methods: trypsin shaving, biotinylation and elution at high pH. Proteomic profiling was carried out by gel-free and gel-nanoLC-MS/MS analyses. The total proteins found with each method were 390 by the trypsin shaving, 329 by the elution at high pH, and 45 using biotinylation. An exclusively extracytoplasmic localization was predicted in 39 (10%) by trypsin shaving, in 47 (15%) by elution at high pH, and 27 (63%) by biotinylation. Comparison between the three extraction methods by Venn diagram and subcellular localization predictors (CELLO v.2.5 and Gpos-mPLoc) allowed us to identify six proteins that are most likely surface-exposed: the SCP-like extracellular protein, a low affinity penicillin-binding protein 5 (PBP5), a basic membrane lipoprotein, a peptidoglycan-binding protein LysM (LysM), a D-alanyl-D-alanine carboxypeptidase (DdcP) and the peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PpiC). Due to their close relationship with the peptidoglycan, we chose PBP5, LysM, DdcP and PpiC to test their potential as vaccine candidates. These putative surface-exposed proteins were overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against the purified proteins were able to induce specific opsonic antibodies that mediated killing of the homologous strain E. faecium E155 as well as clinical strains E. faecium E1162, Enterococcus faecalis 12030, type 2 and type 5. Passive immunization with rabbit antibodies raised against these proteins reduced significantly the colony counts of E. faecium E155 in mice, indicating the effectiveness of these surface-related proteins as promising vaccine candidates to target different enterococcal pathogens.
TI  - Clinical epidemiological study on the incidence of Escherichia coli infections in the cancer patients admitted to Surgery Department II of the Iasi Regional Oncology Institute in 2013.
AB  - The aim of study was to identify pathogens involved in hospital-acquired or community-acquired infections in patients suffering from various types of cancers. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A clinical epidemiological study included a group of 355 cancer patients admitted and operated at the Surgery Department II of the Iasi Regional Oncology Institute in 2013 was performed using data from hospital statistical service and the surgery and laboratory records, then processed by epidemi ological and statistical methods. RESULTS: In cancer patients the pathogen most commonly involved in infections was E. coli, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis, Enterobacter cloacae and Acinetobacter. Analysis of bacterial resistance to antibiotics of the pathogen most commonly involved revealed that of the 29 E. coli strains 22 were tested for resistance/sensitivity to ampicillin; of these, 19 strains showed resistance, and only 3 were sensitive; 14 E. coli strains of were resistant to cephalosporins and 8 sensitive; all strains tested were sensitive to carbapenems, imipenem or meropenem and polypeptides (colistin); the 10 tested strains showed resistance to monobactams (aztreonam). CONCLUSIONS: E. coli was incriminated in most urinary tract infections, the other pathogens being identified sporadically. Surgical wound infections were caused mostly by E. coli and Staphylococcus aureus, followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In our study we encountered increased resistance of E. coli to penicillins, cephalosporins, monobactams (aztreonam), fluoro-quinolones and tetracyclines.
TI  - [Clinical and bacteriological characteristic of infectious purulent complications in patients after related renal transplantation].
AB  - We investigated the frequency and characteristics of infectious purulent and non-infectious complications in living related renal transplant recipients in early postoperative period. It was identified the prevalent microorganisms in urinary tract infections and its antibiotic sensitivity: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Candida albicans. 182 strains of bacteria and Candida were isolated from urine of renal graft patients in early postoperative period (from 2 days to 3 months). The prevention and treatment schemes, antimicrobial drugs dosing regimen were developed. It leads to decrease the infectious complications rate.
TI  - Antibacterial and antibiofilm activities of polysaccharides, essential oil, and fatty oil extracted from Laurus nobilis growing in Lebanon.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the antibacterial activity of the extracts of Laurus nobilis against three Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212 and Staphylococcus epidermidis CIP 444) and two Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli ATCC 35218 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853). Also, the antibiofilm activity has been investigated against the biofilm produced by Staphylococcus epidermidis CIP 444. MATERIALS: The polysaccharides, essential oil, and fatty oils extracted from the plant were used in broth microdilution methods to study the minimal inhibitory concentration, and then the minimal bactericidal concentration was determined. RESULTS: The results showed that alginate, fucoidan, fatty oils and essential oil have good antibacterial activities against the 5 bacterial strains, and a negligible biofilm eradication activity of fucoidan, laminaran, fatty oil, and essential oil was observed, but a promising biofilm eradication activity was obtained with alginate, which showed a reduced biofilm mass even at low concentration. CONCLUSIONS: The extracts obtained have promising antibacterial capacities which need further investigation for them to be incorporated in medical or nutritional applications.
TI  - Anaerobic bacteria grow within Candida albicans biofilms and induce biofilm formation in suspension cultures.
AB  - The human microbiome contains diverse microorganisms, which share and compete for the same environmental niches. A major microbial growth form in the human body is the biofilm state, where tightly packed bacterial, archaeal, and fungal cells must cooperate and/or compete for resources in order to survive. We examined mixed biofilms composed of the major fungal species of the gut microbiome, Candida albicans, and each of five prevalent bacterial gastrointestinal inhabitants: Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterococcus faecalis. We observed that biofilms formed by C. albicans provide a hypoxic microenvironment that supports the growth of two anaerobic bacteria, even when cultured in ambient oxic conditions that are normally toxic to the bacteria. We also found that coculture with bacteria in biofilms induces massive gene expression changes in C. albicans, including upregulation of WOR1, which encodes a transcription regulator that controls a phenotypic switch in C. albicans, from the "white" cell type to the "opaque" cell type. Finally, we observed that in suspension cultures, C. perfringens induces aggregation of C. albicans into "mini-biofilms," which allow C. perfringens cells to survive in a normally toxic environment. This work indicates that bacteria and C. albicans interactions modulate the local chemistry of their environment in multiple ways to create niches favorable to their growth and survival.
TI  - Comparison of the Antibacterial Efficacy of Manuka Honey Against E.faecalis and E.coli - An In vitro Study.
AB  - AIM: To compare the antibacterial efficacy of Manuka honey against E.faecalis and E.coli. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Escherichia coli (ATCC-25922) and Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC-29212) were separately inoculated in the nutrient broth and incubated at 37(o)C for 24-48 hrs. Bacterial samples were kept in contact with each disinfectant solution for varying intervals of time. Once the test time had elapsed 10muL of the bacterial dilutions were plated on Mueller-Hinton agar and incubated for 24-48 hrs at 37 degrees C to estimate the density. Study of the disinfection process with respect to time and Modeling was done. RESULTS: The mean value of the antimicrobial activity of Manuka honey against E.coli and E.faecalis are 1.55 and 0.36 respectively and are relatively higher. It shows that there is a significant difference among the various root canal disinfectant groups against E. coli and E. feacalis. (p<0.001) CONCLUSION: Manuka honey is shown to be a potential root canal disinfectant against gram positive and gram negative bacterial pathogens.
TI  - Comparative evaluation of antimicrobial activity of two root canal sealers: MTA Fillapex and AH 26.
AB  - AIM: Even after a complete root canal therapy, reinfection may occur as a result  of incomplete seal and activation of residual bacteria. Thus, antimicrobial activity is an important characteristic of root canal sealers. MTA Fillapex is a newly developed MTA-based sealer. It has been subjected to various studies evaluating its physical and chemical properties. In this study, we aimed to compare the antimicrobial activity of this sealer to the commonly known widely accepted sealer, AH26. METHODS: MTA Fillapex and AH 26 were exposed the bacterial suspension of Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus mutans, and Candida albicans after setting. After incubation and complete evaporation, BHI was added to microtubes. 24 hours later, the liquid content was placed in agar diffusion plate and bacterial count was performed. ANOVA followed by Tukey test, and t-Test were performed to analyze the data. RESULTS: With regard to all four bacterial groups, the bacterial count was significantly lower in MTAFillapex group comparing to AH 26 group. CONCLUSION: Newly developed MTA Fillapex sealer, has better antimicrobial properties in comparison to the widely accepted AH26 sealer.
TI  - Evolution of the resistance to antibiotics of bacteria involved in urinary tract  infections: a 7-year surveillance study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: We conducted a retrospective analysis on the identification and antibiogram of all bacteria isolated from urine samples with microbiological confirmation of urinary tract infection (UTI) in a Spanish reference hospital over a 7-year period. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed of the identification and antibiogram data. RESULTS: A total of 31,758 uropathogens were isolated. Escherichia coli accounted for the majority (55.2%) of these, followed by Enterococcus faecalis (18.0%) and Klebsiella spp (10.3%). The highest E coli susceptibility rates were to imipenem (93.0%-99.8%), amikacin (97.3%-99.5%), nitrofurantoin (96.7%-98.9%), and fosfomycin (95.3%-100%), and the lowest were to cefuroxime (67.8%-86.4%), ciprofloxacin (61.2%-69.8%), and co-trimoxazole (55.0%-65.5%). We highlight the overall high activity of imipenem, piperacillin-tazobactam, nitrofurantoin, and fosfomycin on isolates versus the low activity of fluoroquinolones, co-trimoxazole, or cephalosporins. The activity of amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and fosfomycin decreased significantly over the 7-year study period. CONCLUSIONS: Imipenem and piperacillin-tazobactam appear to be good options for the empiric treatment of UTI acquired in hospital or requiring hospitalization, whereas nitrofurantoin and fosfomycin can be first-choice antibiotics for the treatment of uncomplicated community-acquired cystitis. However, surveillance studies are required to detect resistance to these antibiotics, given that an increase in uropathogen resistance rates may contraindicate its future use in empiric UTI therapy.
TI  - Terpenoids, flavonoids and caffeic acid derivatives from Salvia viridis L. cvar.  Blue Jeans.
AB  - Three diterpenoids, 1-oxomicrostegiol (1), viroxocin (2), viridoquinone (3), were isolated from the roots of Salvia viridis L. cvar. Blue Jeans. Five known diterpenoids, microstegiol (4), 7alpha-acetoxy-14-hydroxy-8,13-abietadiene-11,12-dione (5; 7-O-acetylhorminone tautomer), 7alpha,14-dihydroxy-8,13-abietadiene-11,12-dione (6; horminone tautomer), ferruginol and salvinolonyl 12-methyl ether (7) were also found in the roots together with 1-docosyl ferulate (8), and a mixture of 2-(4'-alkoxyphenyl) ethyl alkanoates (9). Two lupane triterpenoids, 2alpha-acetoxy-lup-20(29)-en-3beta-ol (10), and 3beta-acetoxy-lup-20(29)-en-2alpha-ol (11) were found in the aerial parts together with known compounds, lup-20(29)-ene-2alpha,3beta-diol (12), ursolic acid, oleanolic acid, beta-sitosterol and beta-sitosterol glucoside. A known phenylpropanoid, trans-verbascoside (or acteoside; 13), was the main constituent in the polar fraction of the aerial part, and it is now reported in the genus Salvia for the first time. Other polyphenolic compounds were cis-verbascoside (14), leucosceptoside A (15), martynoside (16), caffeic acid, 6-O-caffeoyl-glucose (18), rosmarinic acid, salidroside, luteolin-7-O-alpha-rhamnopyranosyl-(1-->6)-beta-galactopyranoside, luteolin-7-O-beta-galactopyranoside, luteolin-7-O-alpha-rhamnopyranosyl-(1-->6)-beta-glucopyranoside, luteolin-7-O-beta-glucopyranoside, and apigenin-7-O-beta-glucopyranoside. The structures were determined by 1D-, 2D-NMR and HR-ESI-MS techniques. Compounds 6, 10, ferruginol, ursolic acid and oleanolic acid exhibited antibacterial activity against Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 775) with MIC 50 muM, 25 muM, 50 muM, 12.5 muM, 12.5 muM respectively. Ferruginol, ursolic acid and oleanolic acid were also active against Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 6571), and Bacillus cereus (ATCC 2599) with MIC 12.5-50 muM. 4 was also active against S.aureus (ATCC 6571) with MIC 50 muM. These values are consistent with previous studies on the antimicrobial activity of Salvia diterpenoids.
TI  - Intestinal translocation of clinical isolates of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis and ESBL-producing Escherichia coli in a rat model of bacterial colonization and liver ischemia/reperfusion injury.
AB  - The objectives of this study were to develop a rat model of gastrointestinal colonization with vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (VRE) and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing E. coli and to evaluate intestinal translocation to blood and tissues after total and partial hepatic ischemia. Methods - We developed a model of rat colonization with VRE and ESBL-E coli. Then we studied four groups of colonized rats: Group I (with hepatic pedicle occlusion causing complete liver ischemia and intestinal stasis); Group II (with partial liver ischemia without intestinal stasis); Group III (surgical manipulation without hepatic ischemia or intestinal stasis); Group IV (anesthetized without surgical manipulation). After sacrifice, portal and systemic blood, large intestine, small intestine, spleen, liver, lungs, and cervical and mesenteric lymph nodes were cultured. Endotoxin concentrations in portal and systemic blood were determined. Results - The best inocula were: VRE: 2.4x10(10) cfu and ESBL-E. coli: 1.12x10(10) cfu. The best results occurred 24 hours after inoculation and antibiotic doses of 750 microg/mL of water for vancomycin and 2.1 mg/mL for ceftriaxone. There was a significantly higher proportion of positive cultures for ESBL-E. coli in the lungs in Groups I, II and III when compared with Group IV (67%; 60%; 75% and 13%, respectively; p:0.04). VRE growth was more frequent in mesenteric lymph nodes for Groups I (67%) and III (38%) than for Groups II (13%) and IV (none) (p:0.002). LPS was significantly higher in systemic blood of Group I (9.761 +/- 13.804 EU/mL-p:0.01). No differences for endotoxin occurred in portal blood. Conclusion -We developed a model of rats colonized with resistant bacteria useful to study intestinal translocation. Translocation occurred in surgical procedures with and without hepatic ischemia-reperfusion and probably occurred via the bloodstream. Translocation was probably lymphatic in the ischemia-reperfusion groups. Systemic blood endotoxin levels were higher in the group with complete hepatic ischemia.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of an experimental dentifrice based on Ricinus communis.
AB  - This study evaluated the antimicrobial activity of a Ricinus communis-based experimental dentifrice for denture hygiene against the following standard strains: Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus mutans, Enterococcus faecalis, Candida albicans and Candida glabrata. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) assay was performed with R. communis in pure oil at 2.5%. Only E. coli was not inhibited by R. communis, but the MIC (0.0781%) was effective against the other microorganisms. From these results it was determined the R. communis concentrations for experimental dentifrices, 1, 2, 5 and 10%, which were evaluated by the test-well diffusion in agar. The commercial dentifrices Colgate, Trihydral and Corega Brite were tested for comparative purposes. The diameter of the zones of bacterial growth inhibition produced around the wells was measured (in mm) with a rule under reflected light. Data were analyzed statistically by analysis of variance and Tukey's post-hoc test (alpha=0.05). Neither the commercial nor the experimental dentifrices were effective against E. coli. The experimental dentifrices containing R. communis at 2, 5 and 10% presented action against S. mutans, S. aureaus and E. faecallis. The experimental dentifrices showed no antimicrobial activity against Candida spp. and E. coli in any of the tested concentrations. Trihydral was the most effective. Comparing the experimental dentifrices, the product with 10% R. communis produced the largest zones of bacterial growth inhibition and had similar antimicrobial activity to the commercial dentifrices, except against S. aureus.
TI  - An ABC transporter is required for secretion of peptide sex pheromones in Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - Enterococci are leading causes of hospital-acquired infection in the United States and continue to develop resistances to new antibiotics. Many Enterococcus faecalis isolates harbor pheromone-responsive plasmids that mediate horizontal transfer of even large blocks of chromosomal genes, resulting in hospital-adapted strains over a quarter of whose genomes consist of mobile elements. Pheromones to which the donor cells respond derive from lipoprotein signal peptides. Using a novel bacterial killing assay dependent on the presence of sex pheromones, we screened a transposon mutant library for functions that relate to the production and/or activity of the effector pheromone. Here we describe a previously uncharacterized, but well-conserved, ABC transporter that contributes to pheromone production. Using three distinct pheromone-dependent mating systems, we show that mutants defective in expressing this transporter display a 5- to 6-order-of-magnitude reduction in conjugation efficiency. In addition, we demonstrate that the ABC transporter mutant displays an altered biofilm architecture, with a significant reduction in biofilm biomass compared to that of its isogenic parent, suggesting that pheromone activity also influences biofilm development. The conservation of this peptide transporter across the Firmicutes suggests that it may also play an important role in cell-cell communication in other species within this important phylum. IMPORTANCE: Enterococcus faecalis ranks as one of the leading causes of hospital-associated infections. Strains possessing resistance to multiple antibiotics are becoming all too common in clinical settings. Pheromone-responsive plasmids play an important role in harboring and disseminating these antibiotic resistance genes. Here we have identified a novel ABC transporter that is responsible for the secretion of peptide pheromones, which enables communication between cells to mediate plasmid transfer. We have also shown that this transporter is important for biofilm formation, providing a strong rationale for its use as a viable therapeutic target which could be targeted to curb infection, as well as the spread of existing drug resistance.
TI  - Oligomerization of esculin improves its antibacterial activity and modulates antibiotic resistance.
AB  - In this particular study, the antibacterial activity of esculin and oligomer fractions was assessed. MIC values of esculin and its oligomer fractions as well as of some antibiotics against Gram-positive and Gram-negative strains and against Escherichia coli multiresistant variants were determined by the standard broth microdilution method. Both esculin and oligoesculin fractions exhibited antibacterial effect against reference strains; Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Salmonella enteritidis and Salmonella typhimurium. It appears that E3 oligomer fraction had the greatest antibacterial activity against these reference strains. Besides, as E2 and E3 revealed the best antibacterial effect against multiresistant variants of E. coli, we decided to test the effect of each, combined to the antibiotic against which the variants were resistant. In the interaction study, E2 and E3 oligoesculin fractions were found to be effective in reducing the resistance of E. coli 6574 to ofloxacin and the resistance of E. coli 6228 to amoxicillin. Only E3 oligoesculin fraction showed a synergetic interaction with amoxicillin and tetracyclin against E. coli 6708, but no interaction was found either with E2 or E3 fractions against E. coli 6234. Our study allowed us to conclude that oligomerization of esculin increases its antibacterial potential, according to the degree of polymerization.
TI  - Monotreme lactation protein is highly expressed in monotreme milk and provides antimicrobial protection.
AB  - Monotremes (platypus and echidna) are the descendants of the oldest ancestor of all extant mammals distinguished from other mammals by mode of reproduction. Monotremes lay eggs following a short gestation period and after an even briefer incubation period, altricial hatchlings are nourished over a long lactation period with milk secreted by nipple-less mammary patches located on the female's abdomen. Milk is the sole source of nutrition and immune protection for the developing young until weaning. Using transcriptome and mass spectrometry analysis of milk cells and milk proteins, respectively, a novel Monotreme Lactation Protein (MLP) was identified as a major secreted protein in milk. We show that platypus and short-beaked echidna MLP genes show significant homology and are unique to monotremes. The MLP transcript was shown to be expressed in a variety of tissues; however, highest expression was observed in milk cells and was expressed constitutively from early to late lactation. Analysis of recombinant MLP showed that it is an N-linked glycosylated protein and biophysical studies predicted that MLP is an amphipathic, alpha-helical protein, a typical feature of antimicrobial proteins. Functional analysis revealed MLP antibacterial activity against both opportunistic pathogenic Staphylococcus aureus and commensal Enterococcus faecalis bacteria but showed no effect on Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Salmonella enterica. Our data suggest that MLP is an evolutionarily ancient component of milk-mediated innate immunity absent in other mammals. We propose that MLP evolved specifically in the monotreme lineage supporting the evolution of lactation in these species to provide bacterial protection, at a time when mammals lacked nipples.
TI  - Presence of aerobic micro-organisms and their influence on basic semen parameters in infertile men.
AB  - Urogenital tract infections in males are one of the significant etiological factors in infertility. In this prospective study, 72 patients with abnormal semen parameters or any other symptoms of urogenital tract infection were examined. Semen analysis according to the WHO 2010 manual was performed together with microbial assessment: aerobic bacteria culture, Chlamydia antigen test, Candida culture, Ureaplasma and Mycoplasma-specific culture. In total, 69.4% of semen samples were positive for at least one micro-organism. Ureaplasma sp. was the most common micro-organism found in 33% of semen samples of infertile patients with suspected male genital tract infection. The 2nd most common micro-organisms were Enterococcus faecalis (12.5%) and Escherichia coli (12.5%), followed by Staphylococcus aureus (7%), Chlamydia trachomatis (7%) and Candida sp. (5.6%). Generally, bacteria were sensitive to at least one of the antibiotics tested. No statistically significant relationship was observed between the presence of aerobic micro-organisms in semen and basic semen parameters: volume, pH, concentration, total count, motility, vitality and morphology.
TI  - Antimicrobial Efficacy of Endodontic Irrigants against Enterococcus Faecalis and  Escherichia Coli: An in vitro study.
AB  - AIM: To evaluate the relative antimicrobial efficacy of five different commonly used antimicrobial agents with regard to reduction in the number of Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli as compared to normal saline. An agar disk diffusion in vitro method was used to test the efficacy of the root canal irrigants against these two microorganisms. The root canal irrigants used were: 5.25% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), 10% citric acid, 17% ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), 3% hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), 0.2% cetrimide and normal saline (as control). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The sample size consisted of 120 agar plates, divided into two groups: groups I and II. Group I consisted of 60 blood agar plates for assessment of E. faecalis and group II consisted of 60 MacConkey agar plates for assessment of E. coli. On each agar plate, 6 circular cellulose nitrate paper disks were placed, on which the inoculum of the respective microorganism was poured with a micropipette. After incubation, these paper disks were removed and put in test tubes containing the particular root canal irrigants, and were vortexed for 60 seconds.The microbial count was then assessed using a microbial colony counter. RESULTS: RESULTS showed that in the group I (E. faecalis), maximum reduction was achieved with cetrimide, followed by NaOCl, H2O2, citric acid and then EDTA. In group II (E. coli), maximum reduction was achieved with NaOCl, followed by cetrimide, H2O2, citric acid and then EDTA.

TI  - Development of a calcium phosphate nanocomposite for fast fluorogenic detection of bacteria.
AB  - Current procedures for the detection and identification of bacterial infections are laborious, time-consuming, and require a high workload and well-equipped laboratories. Therefore the work presented herein developed a simple, fast, and low cost method for bacterial detection based on hydroxyapatite nanoparticles with a nutritive mixture and the fluorogenic substrate. Calcium phosphate ceramic nanoparticles were characterized and integrated with a nutritive mixture for the early detection of bacteria by visual as well as fluorescence spectroscopy techniques. The composite was obtained by combining calcium phosphate nanoparticles (Ca:P ratio, 1.33:1) with a nutritive mixture of protein hydrolysates and carbon sources, which promote fast bacterial multiplication, and the fluorogenic substrate 4-methylumbellipheryl-beta-D-glucuronide (MUG). The composite had an average particle size of 173.2 nm and did not show antibacterial activity against Gram-negative or Gram-positive bacteria. After an Escherichia coli suspension was in contact with the composite for 60-90 min, fluorescence detected under UV light or by fluorescence spectrophotometer indicated the presence of bacteria. Intense fluorescence was observed after incubation for a maximum of 90 min. Thus, this calcium phosphate nanocomposite system may be useful as a model for the development of other nanoparticle composites for detection of early bacterial adhesion.
TI  - A prospective interventional study in chronic prostatitis with emphasis to clinical features.
AB  - PURPOSE: Chronic bacterial prostatitis displays a variety of symptoms (mainly local pain exhibiting vari-ability in origin and intensity). These symptoms often persist despite bacterial eradication. The purpose of this article is to exam the role of phytotherapeutic agents as complementary treatment in patients with bacterial prostatitis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The material consisted of individuals with reported pelvic discomfort and genital pain with or without lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and sexual dysfunction visiting our department from March 2009 to March 2011. Patients underwent Stamey-Meares test (several cases underwent the two glass test). Depending on history and specific symptoms urethral smear and semen cultures were additionally obtained from several patients. All patients were randomized into two groups. Subjects in the first group (72 patients) received appropriate antibiotic (according to the sensitivity test) for 15 days, while subjects in the second group (72 patients) received phytotherapeutic agents for 30 days, additionally the conventional 15 days antibiotic treatment. The response was tested using laboratory and clinical criteria. RESULTS: We found no statistically significant differences between the two groups regarding bacterial and symptom persistence rate, however, symptoms burden was lower in patients receiving combinational treatment. CONCLUSION: Phytotherapeutic agents may improve pain and prostatitis related difficulty in urination. Further randomized, placebo-controlled studies are needed to substantiate safer conclusions.
TI  - Impact of minimal inhibitory concentration breakpoints on local cumulative bacterial susceptibility data and antibiotic consumption.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) of bacteria depends on minimal inhibitory concentration breakpoints issued by national and international breakpoint committees. The current study was performed in order to test the influence of different AST standards on local cumulative AST data and on antibiotic consumption. METHODS: Automated AST was performed with clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Enterococcus faecalis, and E. faecium. From each species 100 prospectively collected non-duplicate clinical isolates were tested and MIC data were interpreted according to the interpretation standards issued by DIN and EUCAST, respectively. In addition cumulative AST data from clinical isolates and antibiotic consumption were monitored before and after implementation of new EUCAST MIC breakpoints. RESULTS: The susceptibility rate of P. aeruginosa against piperacillin and gentamicin, and of C. freundii against piperacillin/tazobactam increased significantly, whereas the susceptibility rates of E. cloacae, S. marcescens, and M. morganii against ciprofloxacin decreased significantly after switching from DIN to EUCAST MIC breakpoints. These changes in the cumulative antibiotic resistance pattern were reflected by enhanced consumption of piperacillin/tazobactam after implementation of EUCAST MIC breakpoints. CONCLUSIONS: These data show that changes of AST breakpoints have a significant influence on local cumulative AST data and on antibiotic consumption.
TI  - Surface free energy activated high-throughput cell sorting.
AB  - Cell sorting is an important screening process in microbiology, biotechnology, and clinical research. Existing methods are mainly based on single-cell analysis as in flow cytometric and microfluidic cell sorters. Here we report a label-free bulk method for sorting cells by differentiating their characteristic surface free energies (SFEs). We demonstrated the feasibility of this method by sorting model binary cell mixtures of various bacterial species, including Pseudomonas putida KT2440, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Salmonella Typhimurium ATCC 14028, and Escherichia coli DH5alpha. This method can effectively separate 10(10) bacterial cells within 30 min. Individual bacterial species can be sorted with up to 96% efficiency, and the cell viability ratio can be as high as 99%. In addition to its capacity of sorting evenly mixed bacterial cells, we demonstrated the feasibility of this method in selecting and enriching cells of minor populations in the mixture (presenting at only 1% in quantity) to a purity as high as 99%. This SFE-activated method may be used as a stand-alone method for quickly sorting a large quantity of bacterial cells or as a prescreening tool for microbial discrimination. Given its advantages of label-free, high-throughput, low cost, and simplicity, this SFE-activated cell sorting method has potential in various applications of sorting cells and abiotic particles.
TI  - Antibacterial validation of electrogenerated hypochlorite using carbon-based electrodes.
AB  - This proof-of-concept study explores the novel use of carbon-based electrodes for the electrochemical generation of hypochlorite and compares the antimicrobial efficacy against commercial hypochlorite solution. Antimicrobial concentrations of hypochlorite were generated using pad-printed carbon and carbon fibre electrodes, yielding up to 0.027% hypochlorite in 60 min and 0.1% hypochlorite in 15 min, respectively, in a nondivided assembly. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the electrogenerated hypochlorite produced using carbon fibre electrodes was established for four medically important bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus approx. 0.025%, Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis approx. 0.012%) and found to be in agreement with those determined using commercial hypochlorite solution. Therefore, carbon-based electrodes, particularly carbon fibre, have proven effective for the generation of antimicrobial concentrations of hypochlorite. The similarity of the MIC values to commercial hypochlorite solutions suggests that the antimicrobial efficacy is derived from the quantified hypochlorite generated and not due to marked cogeneration of reactive oxygen species, as identified for other assemblies. As such, the application of carbon electrodes may be suitable for the local production of hypochlorite for healthcare antisepsis. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Carbon fibre electrodes can rapidly generate antimicrobial concentrations of hypochlorite; as such, these cheap and commercially available electrodes are proposed for the local production of hypochlorite for healthcare antisepsis. Importantly, the antimicrobial properties of the electrochemically generated hypochlorite mirror those of commercial hypochlorite, suggesting this is not enhanced by the cogeneration of reactive oxygen species. This illustrates the potential use of disposable carbon electrodes for localized small-volume production of hypochlorite for surface and skin cleansing, and opens a broader scope of research into the exploitation of carbon electrodes for this application.
TI  - Evaluation of detachment methods for the enumeration of Bacteroides fragilis in sediments via propidium monoazide quantitative PCR, in comparison with Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli.
AB  - AIMS: The aim was to develop an optimized detachment method for separating Bacteroidales from sediments to allow enumeration via PMA-qPCR. The effectiveness of four different detachment treatments in removing Bacteroides fragilis was compared as a function of time as well as in relation to Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli as detected by cultivation and qPCR. METHODS AND RESULTS: Cells were inoculated into four sediments from sea water (SW) and freshwater (FW) beaches. Sediment samples were taken on days 1 and 7 and subjected to four different treatments for separation of micro-organisms. On day 1, the detachment treatments performed equally well in removing intact Bact. fragilis cells. In contrast, 7 days later the detachment treatment with Tween 80 and handshaking (TH) resulted in up to eightfold higher 16S rRNA gene concentrations of intact and total Bact. fragilis cells compared to other detachment treatments. Total Ent. faecalis cells based on the 23S rRNA gene were also preferentially recovered by treatment TH. Cultivable Ent. faecalis or E. coli numbers detached from sediments were similar for all methods in most sediments tested. CONCLUSIONS: Handshaking and 1% Tween 80/NaOH (pH 7.0) eluant was the most efficient technique to recover intact as well as total Bact. fragilis cells in sediment samples with different salinities and after prolonged sediment cell contact time. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The optimized detachment method enables the application of PMA-qPCR to sediment samples to detect the presence of Bacteroidales cells and their DNA in future microbial source tracking studies.
TI  - Vapor-induced transfer of bacteria in the absence of mechanical disturbances.
AB  - Transfer of bacteria through water vapor generated at moderate temperatures (30-50 degrees C) in passive solar stills, has scarcely been reported. The objective of this research was to investigate whether bacteria in highly humid atmospheres can get transferred through water vapor in the absence of other transfer media to find their way to the distillate. To achieve this objective, passive solar reactors were chosen as the medium for experimentation, and distillation experiments were conducted by spiking a pure bacterial culture (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia or Enterococcus faecalis) in low mineralized water vs. highly mineralized water in the dark under moderate temperatures ranges (30-35 degrees C, 40-45 degrees C and 50-55 degrees C). Results showed that bacteria indeed get transferred with the vapor in stills when not exposed to solar U.V. radiation. The trends observed were adequately explained by a zero-modified Hurdle-Poisson model. The numbers of cultivable bacterial colonies transferred were bacterial size, water type and temperature dependent with highest transfers occurring in E. faecalis>E. coli>K. pneumonia at the 40 degrees C range in low mineralized water. Proper management strategies are recommended to achieve complete disinfection in solar stills.
TI  - The influence of urinary pH on antibiotic efficacy against bacterial uropathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of pH on the activity of clinically relevant  antibiotics against bacterial uropathogens. Numerous factors affect antibiotic efficacy within the urinary tract including pH. Because human urine can substantially vary from acidic (pH 4.5) to alkaline (pH 8) conditions and can be easily clinically manipulated, it would be a great advantage to better understand the role of pH in antibiotic treatment of urinary tract infection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This in vitro study investigated the activity of 24 widely used antimicrobial agents against bacterial strains comprising 6 major uropathogenic species (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis) over the range of pH 5-8. Standard disk-diffusion and broth-microdilution assays were used. One-way analysis of variance was applied to determine significance (P <.05). RESULTS: For 18 of the 24 agents, pH was shown to play a significant role in overall inhibitory activity. Although most agents behaved similarly across most or all of the uropathogens tested, several only showed pH-dependent effects against certain organisms. The fluoroquinolones, co-trimoxazole, aminoglycosides, and macrolides all functioned optimally at alkaline pH, whereas the tetracyclines, nitrofurantoin, and many of the beta-lactams tested exhibited their highest activity under more acidic conditions. Sulfamethoxazole, oxacillin, amoxicillin and clavulanic acid, vancomycin, imipenem, and clindamycin were largely unaffected by pH. CONCLUSION: Clinicians should consider the urinary pH of their patients when treating urinary tract infection, especially in complicated scenarios. Future clinical investigations examining urinary pH and antibiotic efficacy may result in the application of decreased antibiotic dosages and regimen durations, potentially reducing antibiotic resistance development.
TI  - Which tree orders in southern Africa have the highest antimicrobial activity and  selectivity against bacterial and fungal pathogens of animals?
AB  - BACKGROUND: The study randomly screened leaf extracts of several hundred southern African tree species against important microbial pathogens to determine which taxa have the highest activity and may yield useful products to treat infections in the animal health market. METHODS: We determined the antibacterial and antifungal activity of 714 acetone leaf extracts of 537 different tree species against Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans. A sensitive serial dilution microplate method was used. RESULTS: Several extracts had MICs as low as 0.02 mg/ml. We analysed 14 out of the 38 tree orders where we determined the activity of more than 8 different tree species representing 89% of all species examined. There were statistically significant differences in some cases. Celastrales, Rosales and Myrtales had the highest activity against Gram-positive bacteria, the Myrtales and Fabales against the Gram-negative bacteria and the Malvales and Proteales against the fungi. Species present in the Asterales followed by the Gentiales and Lamiales had the lowest activities against all the microorganisms tested. Fabales species had the highest activities against all the microorganisms tested. There was substantial selectivity in some orders. Proteales species had very high activity against the fungi but very low activity against the bacteria. The species in the Celastrales and Rosales had very low antifungal activity, low activity against Gram-negative bacteria and very high activity against Gram-positive bacteria. CONCLUSION: Against all classes of microorganisms, the four orders containing species with the highest average antimicrobial activities also contained several species with low activities against different pathogens and vice versa. These results therefore should be used with circumspection in selecting tree orders that would yield the highest probability of finding species with promising activities. Nevertheless there was a twofold increase in probability of finding extracts with interesting antifungal activity from orders with high mean activity than from orders with low mean activity. The probability increased to threefold and fivefold for Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria respectively.
TI  - Low-shear force associated with modeled microgravity and spaceflight does not similarly impact the virulence of notable bacterial pathogens.
AB  - As their environments change, microbes experience various threats and stressors,  and in the hypercompetitive microbial world, dynamism and the ability to rapidly respond to such changes allow microbes to outcompete their nutrient-seeking neighbors. Viewed in that light, the very difference between microbial life and death depends on effective stress response mechanisms. In addition to the more commonly studied temperature, nutritional, and chemical stressors, research has begun to characterize microbial responses to physical stress, namely low-shear stress. In fact, microbial responses to low-shear modeled microgravity (LSMMG), which emulates the microgravity experienced in space, have been studied quite widely in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Interestingly, LSMMG-induced changes in the virulence potential of several Gram-negative enteric bacteria, e.g., an increased enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli-mediated fluid secretion in ligated ileal loops of mice, an increased adherent invasive E. coli-mediated infectivity of Caco-2 cells, an increased Salmonella typhimurium-mediated invasion of both epithelial and macrophage cells, and S. typhimurium hypervirulence phenotype in BALB/c mice when infected by the intraperitoneal route. Although these were some examples where virulence of the bacteria was increased, there are instances where organisms became less virulent under LSMMG, e.g., hypovirulence of Yersinia pestis in cell culture infections and hypovirulence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Listeria monocytogenes in a Caenorhabditis elegans infection model. In general, a number of LSMMG-exposed bacteria (but not all) seemed better equipped to handle subsequent stressors such as osmotic shock, acid shock, heat shock, and exposure to chemotherapeutics. This mini-review primarily discusses both LSMMG-induced as well as bona fide spaceflight-specific alterations in bacterial virulence potential, demonstrating that pathogens' responses to low-shear forces vary dramatically. Ultimately, a careful characterization of numerous bacterial pathogens' responses to low-shear forces is necessary to evaluate a more complete picture of how this physical stress impacts bacterial virulence since a "one-size-fits-all" response is clearly not the case.
TI  - A comparison of conventional methods for the quantification of bacterial cells after exposure to metal oxide nanoparticles.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Due to potential interference of nanoparticles on bacterial quantification, there is a challenge to develop a fast, accurate and reproducible method for bacterial quantification. Currently various bacterial quantification methods are used by researchers performing nanoparticles study, but there has been no efficacy evaluation of these methods. Here we study interference of nanoparticles on three most commonly used conventional bacterial quantification methods, including colony counting to determine the colony-forming units (CFU), spectrophotometer method of optical density (OD) measurement, and flow cytometry (FCM). RESULTS: Three oxide nanoparticles including ZnO, TiO2, and SiO2 and four bacterial species including Salmonella enterica serovar Newport, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, and Escherichia coli were included in the test. Results showed that there is no apparent interference of the oxide nanoparticles on quantifications of all four bacterial species by FCM measurement; CFU counting is time consuming, less accurate and not suitable for automation; and the spectrophotometer method using OD measurement was the most unreliable method to quantify and detect the bacteria in the presence of the nanoparticles. CONCLUSION: In summary, FCM measurement proved to be the best method, which is suitable for rapid, accurate and automatic detection of bacteria in the presence of the nanoparticles.
TI  - A simple and effective method to synthesize fluorescent nanoparticles using tryptophan and light and their lethal effect against bacteria.
AB  - A simple, environmentally friendly and cost-effective method was used to synthesize silver nanoparticles using tryptophan and light. To prepare the nanoparticles, the following components were used: deionized water, silver nitrate, light and tryptophan. The effects of the tryptophan concentration and light exposure time on the formation of tryptophan silver nanoparticles (Tnnps) were studied. The synthesized Tnnps were characterized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy and zeta potential measurements. The synthesized Tnnps were nearly spherical, with sizes of approximately 17 nm. In addition, the antibacterial activity of Tnnps was determined by monitoring the growth curves of strains of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Serratia marcescens, and Enterococcus faecalis using the microdilution test. The Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) for 4 of 5 tested bacteria was determined to be between 20.0 and 17.5 mug/mL for 48 h and between 22.5 and 20.0 mug/mL for 72 h.
TI  - Antibacterial phototoxic effects of synthetic asymmetric and glycosylated curcuminoids in aqueous formulations: studies on curcumin and curcuminoids. LIV.
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the in vitro phototoxic potential of synthetic asymmetric and glycosylated curcuminoids on planktonic model bacteria by counting the colony forming units. The Gram-positive Enterococcus faecalis and the Gram-negative Escherichia coli were exposed to aqueous solutions of the curcuminoids (2.5 muM) in the presence or absence of selected pharmaceutical excipients (Pluronic F127, PEG 400 and HPgammaCD) in combination with a low irradiation dose (5 J/cm(2); lambdamax: 450 nm) of constant irradiance and time. All the asymmetric curcuminoids, but only one of the glycosylated curcuminoids demonstrated substantial phototoxic effect on E.faecalis (4.7 log reduction). Only two of the asymmetric curcuminoids showed a moderate to low phototoxic effect on the more persistent E.coli. This study emphasized that aromatic hydroxyl substituents in the para-position are important to maintain the phototoxic potential of curcuminoids independent of molecular symmetry. Glycosylation of the aromatic substituents resulted in a substantial loss in phototoxicity towards planktonic bacteria, an apparent change in the non-radiative S(1)-decay process and a weaker interaction with Pluronic F127 compared to the non-glycosylated curcuminoids. The selected excipients Pluronic F127, PEG 400 and HPgammaCD strongly influenced the phototoxic potential of the unsymmetrical, non-glycosylated compounds.
TI  - Quantification of polyphenols and evaluation of antimicrobial, analgesic and anti-inflammatory activities of aqueous and acetone-water extracts of Libidibia ferrea, Parapiptadenia rigida and Psidium guajava.
AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Vast numbers of plant species from northeastern Brazil have not yet been phytochemically or biologically evaluated. AIM OF THE STUDY: The goal of this work was to obtain, characterize and show the antimicrobial, analgesic and anti-inflammatory activities of aqueous and acetone-water extracts of Libidibia ferrea, Parapiptadenia rigida and Psidium guajava. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The plant material (100g) was dried, and the crude extracts were obtained by using turbo-extraction (10%; w/v) with water or acetone:water (7:3, v/v) as the extraction solvent. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) methods were used to screen the crude extracts for hydrolysable tannins (gallic acid) and condensed tannins (catechins). The antibacterial activity was evaluated by agar-diffusion and microdilution methods against Gram-positive strains (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Staphylococcus epidermidis INCQS 00016, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212 and a clinical isolate of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) as well as Gram-negative strains (Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Salmonella enteritidis INCQS 00258, Shigella flexneri and Klebsiella pneumoniae). To evaluate the anti-inflammatory activity, a leukocyte migration model was used. Analgesic activity was determined by the hot plate test and the acetic acid-induced abdominal writhing test. Data were analyzed by analysis of variance (ANOVA) at a significance level of 5%. RESULTS: Parapiptadenia rigida presented the highest amount of total polyphenols (35.82 +/- 0.20%), while the greatest catechin content was found in the acetone-water extract of Psidium guajava (EAWPg; 1.04 mug/g). The largest amounts of catechins were found in the aqueous extract of Libidibia ferrea (EALf; 1.07 mug/g) and the acetone-water extract of Parapiptadenia rigida (EAWPr; 1.0 mug/g). All extracts showed activity against Gram-positive bacteria. The aqueous and acetone-water extracts of Psidium guajava showed the greatest inhibition zones in the agar diffusion tests. In the evaluation of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), the most susceptible Gram-positive bacterium was Staphylococcus epidermidis and the most susceptible Gram-negative bacterium was Shigella flexneri. EAPg and EAWPg showed the greatest MIC values. All extracts were significant inhibitors of leukocyte migration (p<0.05). Using the writhing test, significant analgesic activity was found for EAPr (50 mg/kg), EAWPr (100 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg) and EAWPg (50 mg/kg) (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Thus, the appropriate extraction procedure preserves the chemical components such as gallic acid and catechin, and showed antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties.
TI  - Bacteriophages as an alternative strategy for fighting biofilm development.
AB  - The ability of microbes to form biofilms is an important element of their pathogenicity, and biofilm formation is a serious challenge for today's medicine. Fighting the clinical complications associated with biofilm formation is very difficult and linked to a high risk of failure, especially in a time of increasing bacterial resistance to antibiotics. Bacterial species most commonly isolated from biofilms include coagulase-negative staphylococci, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. The frequent failure of antibiotic therapy led researchers to look for alternative methods and experiment with the use of antibacterial factors with a mechanism of action different from that of antibiotics. Experimental studies with bacteriophages and mixtures thereof, expressing lytic properties against numerous biofilm-forming bacterial species showed that bacteriophages may both prevent biofilm formation and contribute to eradication of biofilm bacteria. A specific role is played here by phage depolymerases, which facilitate the degradation of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and thus the permeation of bacteriophages into deeper biofilm layers and lysis of the susceptible bacterial cells. Much hope is placed in genetic modifications of bacteriophages that would allow the equipping bacteriophages with the function of depolymerase synthesis. The use of phage cocktails prevents the development of phage-resistant bacteria.
TI  - Antibiotic prophylaxis for transrectal prostate biopsy-a new strategy.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fluoroquinolones are extensively used as prophylaxis for transrectal  ultrasound-guided biopsy of the prostate (TRUBP). Emerging fluoroquinolone resistance and selection of multiresistant organisms warrant new prophylactic strategies. Pivmecillinam and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid have mutual synergistic activity and the combination of these agents has a broad coverage of the majority of microorganisms causing infectious complications after TRUBP and may be a valuable future prophylactic regimen. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of 2624 men that underwent TRUBP at a Danish university hospital. The patients were divided into three groups. Group 1 (n = 1220) received ciprofloxacin before TRUBP, Group 2 (n = 240) received a combination of pivmecillinam and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid before TRUBP and Group 3 (n = 1161) received an extended prophylaxis with pivmecillinam and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid before and for 2 days after TRUBP. RESULTS: One hundred and ten out of 148 (74.3%) post-TRUBP infections were caused by Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae or Enterococcus faecalis. Group 3 with the extended prophylaxis with pivmecillinam and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid had a significantly lower rate of bacteraemia (0.9%) as compared with Group 1 (1.8%) and Group 2 (3.7%). A significant fall in the proportion of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae was observed from the period when ciprofloxacin was used as prophylaxis (8.1%) compared with the subsequent period when pivmecillinam and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid was used (5.9%). CONCLUSIONS: The combination of pivmecillinam and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid is an attractive prophylaxis for TRUBP from a clinical, bacteriological and ecological point of view as compared with ciprofloxacin.
TI  - Development of a multiplex real-time PCR assay for the rapid diagnosis of neonatal late onset sepsis.
AB  - The diagnosis of late onset sepsis (LOS), a severe condition with high prevalence in preterm infants, is hampered by the suboptimal sensitivity and long turnaround time of blood culture. Detection of the infecting pathogen directly in blood by PCR would provide a much more timely result. Unfortunately, PCR-based assays reported so far are labor intensive and often lack direct species identification. Therefore we developed a real-time multiplex PCR assay tailored to LOS diagnosis which is easy-to-use, is applicable on small blood volumes and provides species-specific results within 4h. Species-specific PCR assays were selected from literature or developed using bioinformatic tools for the detection of the most prevalent etiologic pathogens: Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella spp. and Serratia marcescens. The PCR assays showed 100% specificity, full coverage of the target pathogens and a limit of detection (LOD) of </=10CFUeq./reaction. These LOD values were maintained in the multiplex format or when bacterial DNA was isolated from blood. Clinical evaluation showed high concordance between the multiplex PCR and blood culture. In conclusion, we developed a multiplex PCR that allows the direct detection of the most important bacterial pathogens causing LOS in preterm infants.
TI  - Beyond paraquats: dialkyl 3,3'- and 3,4'-bipyridinium amphiphiles as antibacterial agents.
AB  - Dialkyl 4,4'-bipyridinium compounds, known as 'paraquats' (PQs), have a long history of use as herbicides, as redox indicators, and more recently as potent antibacterial agents. However, due to their ability to form reactive oxygen species (ROS) in vivo, PQs are also known to be toxic. We proposed that altering the electrochemical properties of PQ, specifically by preparing isomeric bipyridinium structures with 3,3'- and 3,4'-substitution of the nitrogen heteroatoms on the biaryl core, would maintain antibacterial activity, yet decrease toxicity. We have thus prepared a series of 17 amphiphiles, dubbed 'metaquat' (MQ) and 'parametaquat' (PMQ), respectively, and investigated their antibacterial and electrochemical properties. Optimal inhibition of bacterial growth was observed in symmetric, biscationic structures; minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values measured as low as 0.5 muM against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria for the compound PMQ-11,11. Electrochemical analysis demonstrated the redox properties of the dialkyl 3,3'- and 3,4'-bipyridinium amphiphiles to be distinct from those of the 4,4'-bipyridinium isomer. Thus MQ and PMQ amphiphiles maintain the strong antibacterial activity of the PQ isomers, but show promise for reduced ROS toxicity.
TI  - Improved antibacterial behavior of titanium surface with torularhodin-polypyrrole film.
AB  - The problem of microorganisms attaching and proliferating on implants and medical devices surfaces is still attracting interest in developing research on different coatings based on antibacterial agents. The aim of this work is centered on modifying titanium (Ti) based implants surfaces through incorporation of a natural compound with antimicrobial effect, torularhodin (T), by means of a polypyrrole (PPy) film. This study tested the potential antimicrobial activity of the new coating against a range of standard bacterial strains: Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The morphology, physical and electrochemical properties of the synthesized films were assessed by SEM, AFM, UV-Vis, FTIR and cyclic voltammetry. In addition, biocompatibility of this new coating was evaluated using L929 mouse fibroblast cells. The results showed that PPy-torularhodin composite film acts as a corrosion protective coating with antibacterial activity and it has no harmful effect on cell viability.
TI  - Antibacterial efficiency of vermiculite/chlorhexidine nanocomposites and results  of the in vivo test of harmlessness of vermiculite.
AB  - Clay minerals have been proposed as very useful materials for modulating drug delivery. These are the commonly used materials in pharmaceutical production both as inorganic carriers or active agents. We focused on the development of suitable long-acting material for local treatment of oral infection where clay minerals act as inorganic drug carriers. Organovermiculites with antibacterial activity were prepared by ion exchange reactions using different concentrations of chlorhexidine diacetate. The samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and thermal analysis (TGA). The antibacterial activity was evaluated by finding the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). All studied organoclays possessed good antibacterial activity after 24h exposure against Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis and particularly against Staphylococcus aureus. Pseudomonas aeruginosa however proved very resistant as only the sample with the highest concentration of CA that successfully inhibited bacterial growth. Furthermore, clay mineral vermiculite was subjected to in vivo toxicological analysis and its influence on gastrointestinal tract during its oral application was investigated. Tissue samples from buccal mucosa, tongue, esophagus, stomach, terminal duodenum, small intestine, caecum, distal colon and liver were subjected to histological examination, both macroscopically and microscopically. Neither systemic nor local reactions were observed. Therefore the toxicity of vermiculite to a mammal model organism can be excluded.
TI  - Nitric oxide levels regulate the immune response of Drosophila melanogaster reference laboratory strains to bacterial infections.
AB  - Studies on the innate immune response against microbial infections in Drosophila  melanogaster involve mutant strains and their reference strains that act as experimental controls. We used five standard D. melanogaster laboratory reference strains (Oregon R, w1118, Canton-S, Cinnabar Brown, and Yellow White [YW]) and investigated their response against two pathogenic bacteria (Photorhabdus luminescens and Enterococcus faecalis) and two nonpathogenic bacteria (Escherichia coli and Micrococcus luteus). We detected high sensitivity among YW flies to bacterial infections and increased bacterial growth compared to the other strains. We also found variation in the transcription of certain antimicrobial peptide genes among strains, with Oregon and YW infected flies showing the highest and lowest gene transcription levels in most cases. We show that Oregon and w1118 flies possess more circulating hemocytes and higher levels of phenoloxidase activity than the other strains upon infection with the nonpathogenic bacteria. We further observed reduced fat accumulation in YW flies infected with the pathogenic bacteria, which suggests a possible decline in physiological condition. Finally, we found that nitrite levels are significantly lower in infected and uninfected YW flies compared to w1118 flies and that nitric oxide synthase mutant flies in YW background are more susceptible to bacterial infection compared to mutants in w1118 background. Therefore, increased sensitivity of YW flies to bacterial infections can be partly attributed to lower levels of nitric oxide. Such studies will significantly contribute toward a better understanding of the genetic variation between D. melanogaster reference strains.
TI  - Screening and characterisation of antimicrobial properties of semisynthetic betulin derivatives.
AB  - Betulin (lup-20(29)-ene-3beta, 28-diol) is a naturally occurring triterpene, which is found in substantial amounts from the outer bark of birch trees. A library of 51 structurally diverse semisynthetic betulin derivatives was screened against five bacterial strains, Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and a fungal strain Candida albicans, using broth microdilution assays. Primary antimicrobial screening at 50 microM concentration led to the identification of five compounds showing antimicrobial properties (inhibition of growth by >70% against one or more microbial strains). According to the dose-response results, 28-O-(N-acetylanthraniloyl)betulin (compound 5) was the most active, showing MIC90 of 6.25 microM against two Gram-positive bacteria, E. faecalis and S. aureus. However, the activity of this compound was affected by albumin binding, which was demonstrated by the loss of activity in a host-pathogen co-culture assay as well as in the antibacterial assay in the presence of increased concentration of albumin. Furthermore, the effects on mammalian cells were evaluated by cytotoxicity assessment on hepatocyte cell culture after 24 h exposure to the compounds. Betulinic aldehyde (18), betulin-28-oxime (31) and hetero cycloadduct with acetoxy groups at carbon atoms 3 and 28 and ethyl substituent at the triazolo ring (43) displayed cytotoxicity towards hepatocytes, with IC50 values of 47, 25 and 16 microM, respectively. The IC50 value for 28-O-(N-acetylanthraniloyl)betulin (5) was 56 microM. The current study presents an insight into using betulin scaffold for developing derivatives with antibacterial potential, and furthermore the necessity of in-depth analysis of found actives through selectivity profiling and follow-up studies including in silico ADMET predictions.
TI  - Using color histograms and SPA-LDA to classify bacteria.
AB  - In this work, a new approach is proposed to verify the differentiating characteristics of five bacteria (Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus oralis, and Staphylococcus aureus) by using digital images obtained with a simple webcam and variable selection by the Successive Projections Algorithm associated with Linear Discriminant Analysis (SPA-LDA). In this sense, color histograms in the red-green-blue (RGB), hue-saturation-value (HSV), and grayscale channels and their combinations were used as input data, and statistically evaluated by using different multivariate classifiers (Soft Independent Modeling by Class Analogy (SIMCA), Principal Component Analysis-Linear Discriminant Analysis (PCA-LDA), Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) and Successive Projections Algorithm-Linear Discriminant Analysis (SPA-LDA)). The bacteria strains were cultivated in a nutritive blood agar base layer for 24 h by following the Brazilian Pharmacopoeia, maintaining the status of cell growth and the nature of nutrient solutions under the same conditions. The best result in classification was obtained by using RGB and SPA-LDA, which reached 94 and 100 % of classification accuracy in the training and test sets, respectively. This result is extremely positive from the viewpoint of routine clinical analyses, because it avoids bacterial identification based on phenotypic identification of the causative organism using Gram staining, culture, and biochemical proofs. Therefore, the proposed method presents inherent advantages, promoting a simpler, faster, and low-cost alternative for bacterial identification.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of Medilox(R) super-oxidized water.
AB  - AIM: Super-oxidized water is one of the broad spectrum disinfectants, which was introduced recently. There are many researches to find reliable chemicals which are effective, inexpensive, easy to obtain and use, and effective for disinfection of microorganisms leading hospital infections. Antimicrobial activity of super-oxidized water is promising. The aim of this study was to investigate the in-vitro antimicrobial activity of different concentrations of Medilox(R) super-oxidized water that is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as high level disinfectant. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this study, super-oxidized water obtained from Medilox(R) [Soosan E & C, Korea] device, which had been already installed in our hospital, was used. Antimicrobial activities of different concentrations of super-oxidized water (1/1, 1/2, 1/5, 1/10, 1/20, 1/50, 1/100) at different exposure times (1, 2, 5, 10, 30 min) against six ATCC strains, eight antibiotic resistant bacteria, yeasts and molds were evaluated using qualitative suspension test. Dey-Engley Neutralizing Broth [Sigma-Aldrich, USA] was used as neutralizing agent. RESULTS: Medilox(R) was found to be effective against all standard strains (Acinetobacter baumannii 19606, Escherichia coli 25922, Enterococcus faecalis 29212, Klebsiella pneumoniae 254988, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 27853, Staphylococcus aureus 29213), all clinical isolates (Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Myroides spp.), and all yeastsat 1/1 dilution in >/=1 minute. It was found to be effective on Aspergillus flavus at 1/1 dilution in >/=2 minutes and on certain molds in >/=5 minutes. CONCLUSION: Medilox(R) super-oxidized water is a broad spectrum, on-site producible disinfectant, which is effective on bacteria and fungi and can be used for the control of nosocomial infection.
TI  - Role of the bacterial vaccine Solco-Urovac(R) in treatment and prevention of recurrent urinary tract infections of bacterial origin.
AB  - Urinary Tract Infections (UTI) represent a serious medical problem with considerably high rate of morbidity. Recurrent episodes of urinary tract infection (rUTI) may commonly develop in the way of relapse or reinfection. For patients, rUTI is always associated with costs, discomfort and decreased quality of life. Standard treatment of rUTI is through antibiotics and usually such treatment is required repeatedly. Repeat course of antibiotics leads to increase of resistance of uropathogenic strains. According to the European Association of Urology, "the present state of microbial resistance development is alarming". Our post-marketing trial was designed to demonstrate the substantial effect of the bacterial vaccine Solco-Urovac(R) both with independent administration and in conjunction with standard antibacterial medication within therapy and prevention of rUTI. Total of 115 patients (men and non-pregnant women) were enrolled in our open-label post-marketing trial. Each patient had more than one year history of rUTI and in the past had already taken appropriate course of standard therapy. The trial group included 50 patients: 32 men, 18 women (average age +/- 32.5). 32 patients (men) of the trial group received vaccination with Solco-Urovac(R) together with the standard antibacterial medication. According to bacteriologic tests, in 62% cases infection was caused by Escherichia coli, and in 38% cases by Morganella morganii, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis. 18 patients within the trial group were women with no recurrence episode at the start and during the trial period. Each woman was involved as the intercourse partner of the respective man within the trial group. The women received only vaccination with Solco-Urovac(R). 65 patients of the control group had more than one year history of rUTI and had been treated earlier, too. Patients of the control group received appropriate antibacterial medication without Solco-Urovac(R). After therapy and follow-up examination, results in the both groups were classified, also in consideration of the pathogen-specified subgroups, and then summarized and compared respectively. During the follow-up period no case of rUTI was noticed in women. In total, analysis of the medical records of 50 patients of the trial group demonstrated no case of rUTI in 46 patients during the follow-up period. Altogether, the rate of improvement of symptoms was as follows: the trial group - 92%, the control group - 74%. Through comparison with the past medical histories of patients, the higher rate of improvement and longer absence of rUTI episodes after treatment were certainly associated with the effect of Solco-Urovac(R). The results of our post-marketing trial allow recommending Solco-Urovac(R) for appropriate reference within the Georgian National Guideline on Urologic Infections.
TI  - Early colonizing Escherichia coli elicits remodeling of rat colonic epithelium shifting toward a new homeostatic state.
AB  - We investigated the effects of early colonizing bacteria on the colonic epithelium. We isolated dominant bacteria, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Lactobacillus intestinalis, Clostridium innocuum and a novel Fusobacterium spp., from the intestinal contents of conventional suckling rats and transferred them in different combinations into germfree (GF) adult rats. Animals were investigated after various times up to 21 days. Proliferative cell markers (Ki67, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, phospho-histone H3, cyclin A) were higher in rats monocolonized with E. coli than in GF at all time points, but not in rats monocolonized with E. faecalis. The mucin content of goblet cells declined shortly after E. coli administration whereas the mucus layer doubled in thickness. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analyses revealed that E. coli resides in this mucus layer. The epithelial mucin content progressively returned to baseline, following an increase in KLF4 and in the cell cycle arrest-related proteins p21(CIP1) and p27(KIP1). Markers of colonic differentiated cells involved in electrolyte (carbonic anhydrase II and slc26A3) and water (aquaglyceroporin3 (aqp3)) transport, and secretory responses to carbachol were modulated after E. coli inoculation suggesting that ion transport dynamics were also affected. The colonic responses to simplified microbiotas differed substantially according to whether or not E. coli was combined with the other four bacteria. Thus, proliferation markers increased substantially when E. coli was in the mix, but very much less when it was absent. This work demonstrates that a pioneer strain of E. coli elicits sequential epithelial remodeling affecting the structure, mucus layer and ionic movements and suggests this can result in a microbiota-compliant state.
TI  - The antimicrobial effects of Citrus limonum and Citrus aurantium essential oils on multi-species biofilms.
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of Citrus limonum and Citrus aurantium essential oils (EOs) compared to 0.2% chlorhexidine (CHX) and 1% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) on multispecies biofilms formed by Candida albicans, Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli. The biofilms were grown in acrylic disks immersed in broth, inoculated with microbial suspension (106 cells/mL) and incubated at 37 degrees C / 48 h. After the biofilms were formed, they were exposed for 5 minutes to the solutions (n = 10): C. aurantium EO, C. limonum EO, 0.2% CHX, 1% NaOCl or sterile saline solution [0.9% sodium chloride NaCl)]. Next, the discs were placed in sterile 0.9% NaCl and sonicated to disperse the biofilms. Tenfold serial dilutions were performed and the aliquots were seeded onto selective agar and incubated at 37 degrees C / 48 h. , the number of colony-forming units per milliliter was counted and analyzed statistically (Tukey test, p </= 0.05). C. aurantium EO and NaOCl inhibited the growth of all microorganisms in multi-species biofilms. C. limonum EO promoted a 100% reduction of C. albicans and E. coli, 49.3% of E. faecalis. CHX was less effective against C. albicans and E. coli, yielding a reduction of 68.8% and 86.7%, respectively. However, the reduction of E. faecalis using CHX (81.7%) was greater than that obtained using C. limonum EO. Both Citrus limonum and Citrus aurantium EOs are effective in controlling multi-species biofilms; the microbial reductions achieved by EOs were not only similar to those of NaOCl, but even higher than those achieved by CHX, in some cases.
TI  - Evaluation of the antimicrobial potency of silver nanoparticles biosynthesized by using an endophytic fungus, Cryptosporiopsis ericae PS4.
AB  - In the present study, silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) with an average particle size  of 5.5 +/- 3.1 nm were biosynthesized using an endophytic fungus Cryptosporiopsis ericae PS4 isolated from the ethno-medicinal plant Potentilla fulgens L. The nanoparticles were characterized using UV-visible spectrophotometer, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), selective area electron diffraction (SAED), and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy analysis. Antimicrobial efficacy of the AgNPs was analyzed singly and in combination with the antibiotic/antifungal agent chloramphenicol/fluconazole, against five pathogenic microorganisms--Staphylococcus aureus MTCC96, Salmonella enteric MTCC735, Escherichia coli MTCC730, Enterococcus faecalis MTCC2729, and Candida albicans MTCC 183. The activity of AgNPs on the growth and morphology of the microorganisms was studied in solid and liquid growth media employing various susceptibility assays. These studies demonstrated that concentrations of AgNPs alone between 10 and 25 muM reduced the growth rates of the tested bacteria and fungus and revealed bactericidal/fungicidal activity of the AgNPs by delaying the exponential and stationary phases. Examination using SEM showed pits and ruptures in bacterial cells indicating fragmented cell membrane and severe cell damage in those cultures treated with AgNPs. These experimental findings suggest that the biosynthesized AgNPs may be a potential antimicrobial agent.
TI  - Efficacy of coral-hydroxyapatite and biphasic calcium phosphate for early bacterial detection.
AB  - Nano- or microhydroxyapatites with microbiological properties are being used to detect pathogens in clinical samples and industrial environments. In this study, the calcium phosphates coral-hydroxyapatite and biphasic calcium phosphate were characterized physicochemically using x-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric, and differential thermal analysis. The morphology, texture, and chemical composition of the ceramics were also investigated using scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive spectroscopy. The biocompatibility of the ceramics was evaluated using Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis. Microorganisms were detected by incorporating the enzyme markers 4-metilumbelliferil-beta-d-glucoside and 4-metilumbelliferil-beta-d-glucuronide in the ceramic powders and evaluating fluorescence. The characterization of the ceramics revealed typical characteristics, such as crystallinity, thermal stability, and chemical composition, consistent with other calcium phosphates. The calcium phosphates coral-hydroxyapatite and biphasic calcium phosphate ceramics differed from one another in morphology, structural topography, particle size distribution, and the capacity to absorb water. These properties can influence the rates of microbiological responses and bacterial detection. Although both materials are suitable for use as structural supports in microbial diagnostic systems, BCP was more efficient and detected E. coli and E. faecalis more rapidly than CHA.
TI  - Toll-like receptor 8 agonist and bacteria trigger potent activation of innate immune cells in human liver.
AB  - The ability of innate immune cells to sense and respond to impending danger varies by anatomical location. The liver is considered tolerogenic but is still capable of mounting a successful immune response to clear various infections. To understand whether hepatic immune cells tune their response to different infectious challenges, we probed mononuclear cells purified from human healthy and diseased livers with distinct pathogen-associated molecules. We discovered that only the TLR8 agonist ssRNA40 selectively activated liver-resident innate immune cells to produce substantial quantities of IFN-gamma. We identified CD161(Bright) mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) and CD56(Bright) NK cells as the responding liver-resident innate immune cells. Their activation was not directly induced by the TLR8 agonist but was dependent on IL-12 and IL-18 production by ssRNA40-activated intrahepatic monocytes. Importantly, the ssRNA40-induced cytokine-dependent activation of MAIT cells mirrored responses induced by bacteria, i.e., generating a selective production of high levels of IFN-gamma, without the concomitant production of TNF-alpha or IL-17A. The intrahepatic IFN-gamma production could be detected not only in healthy livers, but also in HBV- or HCV-infected livers. In conclusion, the human liver harbors a network of immune cells able to modulate their immunological responses to different pathogen-associated molecules. Their ability to generate a strong production of IFN-gamma upon stimulation with TLR8 agonist opens new therapeutic opportunities for the treatment of diverse liver pathologies.
TI  - Prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria and its antibacterial susceptibility pattern among pregnant women attending the antenatal clinic at kanpur, India.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Symptomatic and asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) is common in pregnant  women. Pregnancy enhances the progression from ASB to symptomatic bacteriuria, which if left untreated, could lead to acute pyelonephritis and other adverse outcomes such as prematurity, postpartum, hypertensive disease, anaemia, UTIs and higher foetal mortality rates. AIM: To identify the prevalence of ASB, the most common causative microorganisms and the antibacterial susceptibilities of the isolated microorganisms at a tertiary care centre at Kanpur, India. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total number of 300 asymptomatic pregnant women were screened for ASB by urine culture by using a semi quantitative culture method. RESULTS: In this study, significant bacteriuria was found in only 22 cases (7.3%). Growth of contaminants was seen in 40 cases (13.3%). Among cases which showed positive cultures, 48.9% were primigravidae and 51.1% were multigravidae. Highest incidence was reported in age group of 21-30 years. The predominant organisms which were isolated were Escherichia coli, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus and Proteus mirabilis. Escherichia coli, the most common isolate, was found to be only 61% and 70% sensitive to ampicillin and amoxicillin + clavulanate, respectively. Sensitivity to ceftriaxone and ciprofloxacin was 95%, and sensitivity to amikacin was 99%. Hundred percent sensitivity was found for the broad spectrum pencillins, imipenem, and meropenem. Klebsiella pneumoniae, the second most frequent organism which was grown on culture, was only 11% sensitive to ampicillin, while sensitivity to amoxicillin + clavulanate and cefuroxime was 86%. 100% sensitivity was found for cefepime, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, imipenem and meropenem. CONCLUSION: Routine urine culture test should be carried out for all antenatal women, to detect asymptomatic bacteriuria, and every positive case should be treated with appropriate antibiotic therapy, to prevent any obstetric complication which is associated with pregnancy.
TI  - [Photoreactivation of Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis in the secondary effluent disinfected by UV-TiO2].
AB  - Effects of photoreactivating light intensity (0-41 microW x cm(-2)) on photoreactivation of Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis) in the secondary effluent after UV and UV-TiO2 disinfection were investigated. The results indicated that the disinfection efficiency of UV-TiO2 was much higher than that of UV disinfection. The photoreactivation rate of E. coli was much higher in UV disinfection than that in UV-TiO2 disinfection. Under high light intensity in UV-TiO2 disinfection, high resurrection rate can be induced. However, a higher resurrection rate can be introduced even under low light intensity in the UV disinfection. Meanwhile, UV-TiO2 disinfection had a strong inhibition effect on E. faecalis photoreactivation, when the light intensity was lower than 21 microW x cm(-2), three was no resurrection occurred on E. faecalis after 72 h resurrection irradiation, only under a strong photoreactivating light intensity, the resurrection rate of E. faecalis was observed.
TI  - Autoimmune neutropenia of infancy with recurrent urinary tract infections: a case report.
AB  - Autoimmune neutropenia of infancy is characterized by minor intercurrent infections despite severe neutropenia; severe bacterial infections are uncommon. An infant developed recurrent urinary tract infections at 9 and 11 months of age. The identified uropathogens were Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis, respectively. Empirical treatment with carbapenems, as broad-spectrum antibiotics, promptly resolved the infection without sequelae. Febrile neutropenic children with cancer and autoimmune neutropenia can develop urinary tract infections; therefore, in such infants, urine culture should be obtained through catheterization. In febrile neutropenic infants with no apparent fever source, cephalosporin monotherapy should not be selected empirically because Enterococci can be the involved pathogens.
TI  - Bacteriology and drug susceptibility analysis of pus from patients with severe intra-abdominal infection induced by abdominal trauma.
AB  - The aim of the present study was to retrospectively analyze the bacteriology and  drug susceptibility of pus flora from abdominal trauma patients with severe intra-abdominal infection (SIAI). A total of 41 patients with SIAI induced by abdominal trauma were enrolled in the study, from which 123 abdominal pus samples were obtained. The results from laboratory microbiology and drug sensitivity were subjected to susceptibility analysis using WHONET software. A total of 297 strains were isolated in which Gram-negative bacteria, Gram-positive bacteria and fungi accounted for 53.5 (159/297), 44.1 (131/297) and 0.7% (2/297), respectively. Anaerobic bacteria accounted for 1.7%. The five predominant bacteria were Escherichia coli (E. coli), Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae), Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa). E. coli was highly susceptible to cefoperazone (91%) and imipenem (98%), while Gram-positive cocci were highly susceptible to teicoplanin (100%) and linezolid (100%). S. aureus was 100% susceptible to vancomycin and K. pneumoniae was highly susceptible to imipenem (100%) and amikacin (79%). P. aeruginosa was the most susceptible to ciprofloxacin (90%). Gram-negative bacterial infection was present in the majority of cases of SIAI. However, a large number of patients were infected by Gram-positive bacteria, particularly S. aureus that exhibited significant resistance to penicillin (100%), oxacillin (100%) and a third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic cefotaxime (95%). Amongst the pathogenic bacteria that cause SIAI, both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria account for a high proportion, so high-level and broad-spectrum antibiotics should be initially used.
TI  - Oxidative stress enhances the expression of sulfur assimilation genes: preliminary insights on the Enterococcus faecalis iron-sulfur cluster machinery regulation.
AB  - The Firmicutes bacteria participate extensively in virulence and pathological processes. Enterococcus faecalis is a commensal microorganism; however, it is also a pathogenic bacterium mainly associated with nosocomial infections in immunocompromised patients. Iron-sulfur [Fe-S] clusters are inorganic prosthetic groups involved in diverse biological processes, whose in vivo formation requires several specific protein machineries. Escherichia coli is one of the most frequently studied microorganisms regarding [Fe-S] cluster biogenesis and encodes the iron-sulfur cluster and sulfur assimilation systems. In Firmicutes species, a unique operon composed of the sufCDSUB genes is responsible for [Fe-S] cluster biogenesis. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of the E. faecalis sufCDSUB system in the [Fe-S] cluster assembly using oxidative stress and iron depletion as adverse growth conditions. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction demonstrated, for the first time, that Gram-positive bacteria possess an OxyR component responsive to oxidative stress conditions, as fully described for E. coli models. Likewise, strong expression of the sufCDSUB genes was observed in low concentrations of hydrogen peroxide, indicating that the lowest concentration of oxygen free radicals inside cells, known to be highly damaging to [Fe-S] clusters, is sufficient to trigger the transcriptional machinery for prompt replacement of [Fe-S] clusters.
TI  - Influence of acetylation degree and molecular weight of homogeneous chitosans on  antibacterial and antifungal activities.
AB  - The results given in the literature are conflicting when considering the relationship between antimicrobial activity and chitosan characteristics. To be able to clarify, we prepared fifteen homogeneous chitosans with different acetylation degrees (DA) and molecular weights (MW) by reacetylation of a fully deacetylated chitin under homogeneous conditions. They were tested at different pH values for their antimicrobial activities against four Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Salmonella typhi), four Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis and Micrococcus luteus) and three fungi (Aspergillus niger, Fusarium oxysporum and Alternaria solani). Chitosans markedly inhibited growth of most bacteria and fungi tested, although the inhibitory effect depends on the type of microorganism and on the chitosan characteristics (DA and MW) with minimum inhibitory concentrations in the range of 0.001 to 0.1 w%. Considering chitosan efficiency on bacteria, our series of data clearly show that the lower DA and the lower pH give the larger efficiency. Antibacterial activity was further enhanced for Gram-negative bacteria with decreasing MW, whereas, opposite effect was observed with the Gram-positive. Concerning the antifungal activity, the influence of chitosan characteristics was dependent on the particular type of fungus. Fungal growth decreased with increasing MW for F. oxysporum and decreasing DA for A. solani, but no MW or DA dependences were observed with A. niger.
TI  - Frequency and antibiotic susceptibility patterns of urinary pathogens in male outpatients in Argentina.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Knowledge of the etiology and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of uropathogens is important for determining the best treatment option. This study aimed to determine the distribution and antibiotic susceptibility patterns of bacterial strains isolated from adult male outpatients. METHODOLOGY: Between November 2012 and April 2013, 3,105 community urine samples were analyzed from adult male patients who attended the Laboratorio Hidalgo, Buenos Aires, Argentina. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by the Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method. Isolates resistant to third generation cephalosporin were tested for extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) production using the double-disk synergy test. RESULTS: Of the 3,105 urine samples analyzed, 791 (25.5%) had significant bacteriuria. The frequency of positive urine cultures increased significantly with patient age. Escherichia coli was isolated most frequently (47.3%), followed by Enterococcus faecalis (13.6%), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (11.9%). Gram-negative organisms represented 78.8% of urinary pathogens. The highest activities against Gram-negative bacteria were found with imipenem (99.0%), amikacin (98.1%), ertapenem (94.2%), fosfomycin (90.7%), and piperacillin-tazobactam (90.1%). The frequencies of ESBLs among E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and P. mirabilis were 15.2 %, 22.3%, and 8%, respectively. Fosfomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and nitrofurantoin were most effective against Gram-positive organisms. CONCLUSIONS: Fosfomycin may be an excellent option for cystitis treatment in patients without risk factors, whereas piperacillin-tazobactam is preferred for the treatment of parenchymatous UTIs, complicated UTIs, and UTIs associated with risk factors. To ensure the optimal selection of antibiotics, physicians should have access to up-to-date information about the local prevalence of antimicrobial resistance.
TI  - Determination of kinetics and the crystal structure of a novel type 2 isopentenyl diphosphate: dimethylallyl diphosphate isomerase from Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - Isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase (IDI) is a key enzyme in the isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway and is required for all organisms that synthesize isoprenoid metabolites from mevalonate. Type 1 IDI (IDI-1) is a metalloprotein that is found in eukaryotes, whereas the type 2 isoform (IDI-2) is a flavoenzyme found in bacteria that is completely absent from human. IDI-2 from the pathogenic bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae was recombinantly expressed in Escherichia coli. Steady-state kinetic studies of the enzyme indicated that FMNH2 (KM =0.3 muM) bound before isopentenyl diphosphate (KM =40 muM) in an ordered binding mechanism. An X-ray crystal structure at 1.4 A resolution was obtained for the holoenzyme in the closed conformation with a reduced flavin cofactor and two sulfate ions in the active site. These results helped to further approach the enzymatic mechanism of IDI-2 and, thus, open new possibilities for the rational design of antibacterial compounds against sequence-similar and structure-related pathogens such as Enterococcus faecalis or Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Recurring hyperammonemic encephalopathy induced by bacteria usually not producing urease.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hyperammonemic encephalopathy may occur when urease-positive bacteria in the urinary tract produce ammonium which directly enters systemic circulation. Predisposing conditions such as a neurogenic bladder can increase both urinary tract infection and urine stagnation. CASE PRESENTATION: We describe the case of a 66 years old woman with a neurogenic bladder who twice developed hyperammonemic encephalopathy following urinary tract infection. During the second episode Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis have been isolated in the urine. The neurologic examination showed psychomotor slowing, weak photomotor reflex, nystagmus in the lateral gaze and asterixis. The EEG showed triphasic waves which disappeared along with clinical recovery. CONCLUSION: Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis are commonly considered urease-negative bacteria. Although frequently involved in urinary tract infections, their role in causing hyperammonemic encephalopathy have not been previously reported. Moreover, despite only one case with a neurogenic bladder have been described so far, our is the first patient with reoccurring hyperammonemic encephalopathy secondary to urinary tract infections.
TI  - [Our experience in Fournier's gangrene with severe septic shock].
AB  - Fournier's gangrene is a rare, rapidly progressing necrotizing fasciitis, which involves the genital area and perineum, progresses towards the thighs and abdominal wall through fascial plains. In our surgical department we treated seven patients with Fournier's gangrene between 2007 and 2011. Early diagnosis, immediate radical surgical debridement, necrosectomy, appropriate antibiotics and intensive care are all required and necessary for the successful treatment. Despite appropriate therapy, two patients were lost in septic shock.
TI  - Purulent pericarditis after liver abscess: a case report.
AB  - We present the case of a 49-year-old woman, with previous clinical antecedents of recent hepatic metastasis, who was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure and hemodynamic instability. She was found to have purulent pericarditis complicated by pericardial tamponade and pleural effusion, as well as surgical site infection, which was the origin of the disease. Cultures of the surgical wound and the pericardial effusion were positive for Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli. A pericardial tap was performed and the intra-abdominal abscess was surgically drained. Pleural effusion was also evacuated. She received antibiotic treatment and recovered successfully. The only after-effect was a well-tolerated effusive-constrictive pericarditis.
TI  - Demography and burden of care associated with patients readmitted for urinary tract infection.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most prevalent admission  diagnoses in hospital-based clinical practice. Despite its frequency, few data are available regarding its demographics and economic implications. PURPOSE: To describe the demography, epidemiology, and burden of care of patients admitted to hospital with UTI and compare these characteristics depending on admission status. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study using an administrative database of patients admitted to Hartford Hospital (September 2011-August 2012) with UTI. Patient demographics, hospital characteristics, and total costs of care were examined. RESULTS: A total of 2345 unique patients were included. The mean age of the patients was 78 years and 71% were female. Median length of stay and total cost were 5 days and $8326 (interquartile range $5388-$14,179), respectively. A total of 359 patients (16.4%) were readmitted within 30 days, of which 111 patients (5.1%) had UTI on readmission. Only 16.3% of readmitted patients were infected with the same causative pathogen. A significant increase in the incidence of Enterococcus faecalis (1.2% vs. 9.3%; p = 0.046) occurred upon readmission, whereas occurrence of Enterobacteriaceae infection decreased in the readmission group (50.0% vs. 25.6%; p = 0.006), including a lower proportion of Escherichia coli (32.5% vs. 11.6%; p < 0.001). A higher proportion of readmission pathogens were nonsusceptible, including significant changes to cefazolin (24.4% vs. 63.6%; p = 0.004) and cefepime (8.7% vs. 27.6; p = 0.05). CONCLUSION: UTI is highly prevalent and is associated with significant utilization of health-care resources among hospitalized patients. These findings, coupled with considerable rates of 30-day readmission, stress the importance of proper diagnosis and treatment.
TI  - Eco-designed biohybrids based on liposomes, mint-nanosilver and carbon nanotubes  for antioxidant and antimicrobial coating.
AB  - Noncovalent entities (consisting of liposomes, phyto-nanosilver and carbon nanotubes) with interesting properties were constructed by a "green" bottom-up method. Phytosynthesis of silver nanoparticles using the Mentha piperita extract combines the benefits of this herb with the interesting properties of silver. The obtained silver-based biohybrids showed antioxidant and antimicrobial properties that have been considerable improved in the presence of carbon nanotubes. Thus the eco-designed bioconstructs consisting of cholesterol-containing liposomes, phytonanosilver and carbon nanotubes exhibited high antioxidant activity (AA=90.8%) and have been shown to be strong biocides offering inhibition zone of 25mm against Escherichia coli and 23mm against Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis.
TI  - Development of an immunochromatographic test with anti-LipL32-coupled gold nanoparticles for Leptospira detection.
AB  - Detection of antibody specific to Leptospira by various immunological techniques  has been used for leptospirosis diagnosis. However, the sensitivity of antibody detection during the first few days after infection is low. Molecular techniques are suggested to provide earlier diagnosis than antibody detection, but a rapid and easy to perform assay for Leptospira antigen detection would provide an additional useful tool for disease diagnosis. In this study, we coupled gold nanoparticles with antibody to LipL32, a protein commonly found in pathogenic Leptospira. This coupled gold reagent was used in the immunochromatographic strip for Leptospira detection. We demonstrated that the sensitivity of Leptospira detection by this strip was 10(3) ml(-1). There was no positive result detected when strips were tested with non-pathogenic Leptospira, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus group B, Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis or Enterococcus faecium. These data suggest that gold nanoparticles coupled with antibody to LipL32 could be used for Leptospira detection by a rapid test based on an immunochromatographic technique.
TI  - [Clinical distribution and antimicrobial resistance analysis of 754 pathogenic bacteria in diabetic foot infection].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the microbiological profiles and antibiotic susceptibility  patterns of organisms isolated from diabetic foot ulcers so as to provide selection rationales of antibiotics. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted on the microbiological profiles and antibiotic susceptibilities in 754 strains of pathogens isolated from 519 patients with diabetic foot ulcers at our hospital from January 2010 to August 2013. The inter-group data were compared by Chi-square test. RESULTS: There were 322 (62.0%) males and 197 (38.0%) females. Their mean age was (67.7 +/- 12.3) (30-93) years, duration of diabetes 10 (0-40) years, duration of lower-limb lesion 1.0 (0.0-72.0) months and HbA1c (9.09% +/- 2.28%). Among 444 (85.5%) cases, a total of 754 strains of pathogens were isolated. Gram-positive aerobes were the most frequently isolated (47.3%, 357 strains) and followed by gram-negative aerobes and fungus (40.3% vs 12.3%, 304 vs 93 strains respectively). With rising Wagner's grades, bacterial floras transformed from Gram-positive cocci to Gram-negative rods while fungus and composite infections increased. And 122 strains were of multi drug resistant organisms (MDRO). Among 357 strains of Gram-positive bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis were dominating floras. Staphylococcus was highly resistant to penicillin G, erythromycin, and oxacillin while vancomycin and linezolid were the most effective agents against gram-positive bacteria. Among 304 strains of gram-negative bacteria, enterobacteria were the most prevalent, including 48 strains of Escherichia coli, 34 strains of Proteus mirabilis and 31 strains of Proteus vulgaris. And there were 29 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Enterobacteria were highly resistant to ampicillin, followed by bactrim and furadantin while meropenem, imipenem, piperacillin/sulbactam, sulperazone and cefepime were the most effective agents. The predominant fungus was Blastomyces albicans. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with severe diabetic foot ulcers, Gram-negative rods predominate while the prevalence of fungus and composite infections increases. Vancomycin and imipenem maintain highly antibacterial activity. It is essential to pay attention to pathogen survey and use antibiotics more rationally.
TI  - New rhenium complexes with ciprofloxacin as useful models for understanding the properties of [99mTc]-ciprofloxacin radiopharmaceutical.
AB  - Rhenium complexes with the antibiotic ciprofloxacin have been prepared to be studied as models of technetium radiopharmaceuticals. With this aim, the new rhenium complexes 1 {[ReO(Cpf)2]Cl}, 2 {[ReO(CpfH)2]Cl3} and 3 {fac-[Re(CO)3(H2O)(Cpf)]} with ciprofloxacin (CpfH=ciprofloxacin; Cpf=conjugated base of ciprofloxacin) have been synthesised and characterised by elemental analyses, IR, NMR ((1)H, (19)F and (13)C CP-MAS) spectroscopy, as well as MS measurements. All spectroscopic data are consistent with the coordination of ciprofloxacin in all these complexes through the carbonyl and the carboxylate oxygen atoms with the formation of a six member chelate ring. The study of a Tc-ciprofloxacin solution by ESI-MS reveals the presence of [TcO(Cpf)2](+) cations, which agrees with the hypothesis that complexes 1 and 2 can be seen as model rhenium complexes of this radiopharmaceutical. Antimicrobial and DNA gyrase inhibition studies performed with complexes 2 and 3 have shown a very similar behaviour between complex 2 and the free antibiotic, whereas complex 3 exhibit a lower antimicrobial activity. Based on a joint analysis of the data reported in the literature and the chemical and biological results obtained in this study, a tentative proposal to explain some aspects of the behaviour of Tc-ciprofloxacin radiopharmaceutical has been made.
TI  - Comparative analysis of pathogenic organisms in cockroaches from different community settings in Edo State, Nigeria.
AB  - Cockroaches are abundant in Nigeria and are seen to harbour an array of pathogens. Environmental and sanitary conditions associated with demographic/socio-economic settings of an area could contribute to the prevalence of disease pathogens in cockroaches. A total of 246 cockroaches (Periplaneta americana) in urban (Benin, n=91), semi-urban (Ekpoma, n=75) and rural (Emuhi, n=70) settings in Edo State, Nigeria were collected within and around households. The external body surfaces and alimentary canal of these cockroaches were screened for bacterial, fungal, and parasitological infections. Bacillus sp. and Escherichia coli were the most common bacteria in cockroaches. However, Enterococcus faecalis could not be isolated in cockroaches trapped from Ekpoma and Emuhi. Aspergillus niger was the most prevalent fungus in Benin and Ekpoma, while Mucor sp. was predominant in Emuhi. Parasitological investigations revealed the preponderance of Ascaris lumbricoides in Benin and Emuhi, while Trichuris trichura was the most predominant in Ekpoma. The prevalence and burden of infection in cockroaches is likely to be a reflection of the sanitary conditions of these areas. Also, cockroaches in these areas making incursions in homes may increase the risk of human infections with these disease agents.
TI  - Low-dose cisplatin administration to septic mice improves bacterial clearance and programs peritoneal macrophage polarization to M1 phenotype.
AB  - Sepsis is a systemic inflammatory response to infection, and early responses of macrophages are vital in controlling the infected microorganisms. We used a cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) model of sepsis to determine the role of cisplatin (0.1, 0.5 and 1 mg kg(-1)) with respect to peritoneal macrophages, controlling peritoneal/blood bacterial infection, and systemic inflammation. We found that mice which received low-dose (0.1 and 0.5 mg kg(-1)) i.p. cisplatin had lower mortality rate and improved clinical scores compared with mice in normal saline-treated group, and the level of IL-6 and TNF-alpha was significantly reduced after cisplatin administration in peritoneal fluid of mice underwent CLP. Although cisplatin had no directly bactericidal ability, the numbers of bacteria in peritoneal and blood were significantly reduced at 24 and 72 h after the onset of CLP. Besides, in vivo phagocytosis and killing assay showed that the ability of macrophage derived from peritoneum was significantly increased with cisplatin treatment (5, 10, and 15 muM) for both gram-positive (Enterococcus faecalis) and gram-negative (Escherichia coli) bacteria. This was associated with the macrophage phenotype polarization from CD11b(+) F4/80(high) CD206(-) to CD11b(+) F4/80(low) CD206(-) M1 group. These findings underscore the importance of low-dose cisplatin in the treatment of sepsis.
TI  - Formulation and characterization of lyophilized curcumin solid dispersions for antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT): studies on curcumin and curcuminoids LII.
AB  - CONTEXT: Bacterial resistance to antibiotics is increasing and alternative antibacterial treatments like antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) are needed. Curcumin is under investigation as a potential photosensitizer in aPDT. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to develop rapidly dissolving formulations of curcumin that could photoinactivate both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Curcumin solid dispersions with methyl-beta-cyclodextrin and hyaluronic acid (HA), hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) or both HA and HPMC were prepared through lyophilization. The lyophilizates were characterized by curcumin drug load [% (w/w)], differential scanning calorimetry, photostability, thermal stability, their ability to form supersaturated solutions and by in vitro photoinactivation of Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The lyophilizates were amorphous solid dispersions with a curcumin drug load in the range of 1.4-5.5% (w/w) depending on the included polymer and the ratio between curcumin and the cyclodextrin. The lyophilizates were photolabile, but thermally stable and dissolved rapidly in contact with water to form supersaturated solutions. Selected lyophilizates demonstrated >log 6 reduction of colony forming units/ml of both E. faecalis and E. coli after exposure to low curcumin concentrations (0.5-10 microM) and blue light dose (11-16 J/cm(2)). The high drug load of the lyophilizates, rapid dissolution, ability to form relatively stable supersaturated solutions and the very high phototoxicity towards both E. faecalis and E. coli make these lyophilizates suitable for in vivo aPDT. CONCLUSIONS: This treatment with optimized curcumin formulations should be explored as an alternative to topical antibiotics in the treatment of wound infections.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of THAM Trisphenylguanide against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - This study investigated the potential antibacterial activity of three series of compounds synthesized from 12 linear and branched polyamines with 2-8 amino groups, which were substituted to produce the corresponding guanides, biguanides, or phenylguanides, against Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. Antibacterial activity was measured for each compound by determining the minimum inhibitory concentration against the bacteria, and the toxicity towards mammalian cells was determined. The most effective compound, THAM trisphenylguanide, was studied in time-to-kill and cytoplasmic leakage assays against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA, USA300) in comparison to chlorhexidine. Preliminary toxicity and MRSA challenge studies in mice were also conducted on this compound. THAM trisphenylguanide showed significant antibacterial activity (MIC approximately 1 mg/L) and selectivity against MRSA relative to all the other bacteria examined. In time-to-kill assays it showed increased antimicrobial activity against MRSA versus chlorhexidine. It induced leakage of cytoplasmic content at concentrations that did not reduce cell viability, suggesting the mechanism of action may involve membrane disruption. Using an intraperitoneal mouse model of invasive MRSA disease, THAM trisphenylguanide reduced bacterial burden locally and in deeper tissues. This study has identified a novel guanide compound with selective microbicidal activity against Staphylococcus aureus, including a methicillin-resistant (MRSA) strain.
TI  - Isolation and biological activity of compounds from Garcinia preussii.
AB  - CONTEXT: Plants of the genus Garcinia (Clusiaceae) are traditionally used to relieve stomachaches, toothaches, and as a chew stick. OBJECTIVE: In order to determine which compounds were responsible for these activities, a phytochemical investigation of the fruits and leaves of Garcinia preussii Engl. was pursued. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Plants were extracted by solvents of various polarities. Compounds isolation was then carried out using chromatography methods (medium- and high-pressure liquid chromatography, open column and thin-layer chromatography). The isolated compounds were identified and characterized by using 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopies. The antioxidant activity was evaluated using DPPH(*), ABTS(*-), ALP, and ORAC assays. The antimicrobial activity was assayed against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis by determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) value. The cytotoxic activity of most of the isolated compounds was evaluated on a small panel of human cancer cell lines (DU145, HeLa, HT-29, and A431) using the XTT method. RESULTS: The phytochemical investigation of G. preussii led to the isolation of eight known compounds, six benzophenones and two flavonoids. These compounds were tested for their biological activities. 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 and 8 demonstrated a high free radical scavenging activity with ER50 ranging from 0.1 to 0.7. The antimicrobial activity was shown only against Gram-positive bacteria for 1, 4, and 5. A moderate cytotoxic activity with IC50 ranging from 7 to 50 microM was observed, except for 6 which was not active. CONCLUSION: These results appear to support some of the properties reported for Garcinia species.
TI  - Infliximab therapy increases the frequency of circulating CD16(+) monocytes and modifies macrophage cytokine response to bacterial infection.
AB  - Crohn's disease (CD) has been correlated with altered macrophage response to microorganisms. Considering the efficacy of infliximab treatment on CD remission, we investigated infliximab effects on circulating monocyte subsets and on macrophage cytokine response to bacteria. Human peripheral blood monocyte-derived macrophages were obtained from CD patients, treated or not with infliximab. Macrophages were infected with Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) or M. avium subsp avium, and cytokine levels [tumour necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin (IL)-10] were evaluated at different time-points. To evaluate infliximab-dependent effects on monocyte subsets, we studied CD14 and CD16 expression by peripheral blood monocytes before and after different infliximab administrations. We also investigated TNF secretion by macrophages obtained from CD16(+) and CD16(-) monocytes and the frequency of TNF(+) cells among CD16(+) and CD16(-) monocyte-derived macrophages from CD patients. Infliximab treatment resulted in elevated TNF and IL-10 macrophage response to bacteria. An infliximab-dependent increase in the frequency of circulating CD16(+) monocytes (particularly the CD14(++) CD16(+) subset) was also observed (before infliximab: 4.65 +/- 0.58%; after three administrations: 10.68 +/- 2.23%). In response to MAP infection, macrophages obtained from CD16(+) monocytes were higher TNF producers and CD16(+) macrophages from infliximab-treated CD patients showed increased frequency of TNF(+) cells. In conclusion, infliximab treatment increased the TNF production of CD macrophages in response to bacteria, which seemed to depend upon enrichment of CD16(+) circulating monocytes, particularly of the CD14(++) CD16(+) subset. Infliximab treatment of CD patients also resulted in increased macrophage IL-10 production in response to bacteria, suggesting an infliximab-induced shift to M2 macrophages.
TI  - Role of glycolipids in the pathogenesis of Enterococcus faecalis urinary tract infection.
AB  - BACKGROUND: After uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC), Enterococcus faecalis is the second most common pathogen causing urinary tract infections. Monoglucosyl-diacylglycerol (MGlcDAG) and diglucosyl-diacylglycerol (DGlcDAG) are the main glycolipids of the E. faecalis cell membrane. Examination of two mutants in genes bgsB and bgsA (both glycosyltransferases) showed that these genes are involved in cell membrane glycolipid biosynthesis, and that their inactivation leads to loss of glycolipids DGlcDAG (bgsA) or both MGlcDAG and DGlcDAG (bgsB). Here we investigate the function of bgsB and bgsA regarding their role in the pathogenesis in a mouse model of urinary tract infection and in bacterial adhesion to T24 bladder epithelial cells. RESULTS: In a mouse model of urinary tract infection, we showed that E. faecalis 12030DeltabgsB and E. faecalis 12030DeltabgsA mutants, colonize uroepithelial surfaces more efficiently than wild-type bacteria. We also demonstrated that these mutants showed a more than three-fold increased binding to human bladder carcinoma cells line T24 compared to the wild-type strain. Bacterial binding could be specifically inhibited by purified glycolipids. Lipoteichoic acid (LTA), wall-teichoic acid (WTA), and glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) were not significantly involved in binding of E. faecalis to the bladder epithelial cell line. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that the deletion of bgsB and bgsA and the absence of the major glycolipid diglucosyl-diacylglycerol increases colonization and binding to uroepithelial cells. We hypothesize that secreted diglucosyl-diacylglycerol blocks host binding sites, thereby preventing bacterial adhesion. Further experiments will be needed to clarify the exact mechanism underlying the adhesion through glycolipids and their cognate receptors.
TI  - Paenibacterin, a novel broad-spectrum lipopeptide antibiotic, neutralises endotoxins and promotes survival in a murine model of Pseudomonas aeruginosa-induced sepsis.
AB  - Paenibacterin, produced by Paenibacillus thiaminolyticus OSY-SE, is active both against Gram-negative and Gram-positive pathogens, including antibiotic-resistant strains of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis. Paenibacterin showed relatively low cytotoxicity against a human kidney cell line (ATCC CRL-2190), with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50)>/=109mug/mL. The cationic paenibacterin molecule binds to the negatively charged Gram-negative endotoxins in vitro, suggesting that paenibacterin can neutralise lipopolysaccharides. In a murine septic shock model, two 500mug doses of paenibacterin significantly increased the survival of mice challenged with a lethal level of P. aeruginosa. Considering that paenibacterin is effective against many strains of antibiotic-resistant pathogens, this study suggests that this antimicrobial agent is a promising candidate as a new drug.
TI  - Fabrication and characterization of bioactive and antibacterial composites for dental applications.
AB  - There is an increasing clinical need to design novel dental materials that combine regenerative and antibacterial properties. In this work the characterization of a recently developed sol-gel-derived bioactive glass ceramic containing silver ions (Ag-BG) is presented. The microstructural characteristics, ion release profile, zeta potential value and changes in weight loss and pH value as a function of the immersion time of Ag-BG in Tris buffer are evaluated. Ag-BG is also incorporated into natural extracellular matrix (ECM) hydrogel to further enhance its regenerative properties. Then, the micro and macro architectures of these new composites (ECM/Ag-BG) are characterized. In addition, the antibacterial properties of these new composites are tested against Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis, a bacterium commonly implicated in the pathogenesis of dental pulp infections. Cell-material interaction is also monitored in a primary culture of dental pulp cells. Our study highlights the benefits of the successful incorporation of Ag in the bioactive glass, resulting in a stable antibacterial material with long-lasting bactericidal activity. Furthermore, this work presents for the first time the fabrication of new Ag-doped composite materials, with inductive pulp-cell proliferation and antibacterial properties (ECM/Ag-BG). This advanced composite made of Ag-BG incorporated into natural ECM possesses improved properties that may facilitate potential applications in tooth regeneration approaches.
TI  - Colloidal gold-based immunochromatographic strip test compromising optimised combinations of anti-S. suis capsular polysaccharide polyclonal antibodies for detection of Streptococcus suis.
AB  - A rapid diagnosis kit that detects Streptococcus suis (S. suis) antigens from urine with an immunochromatographic stripe (ICS) test was developed in this study. The ICS test was produced using colloidal gold coated with polyclonal antibodies (pAbs) against S. suis. The pAbs were developed from rabbits immunised with S. suis serotype 2 capsular polysaccharides (CPS). Development of the pAbs was investigated to establish their binding to CPS and to determine the maximum sensitivity of two combination antibodies for the ICS test. The results of the ICS optimisation revealed that the combinations of pAb C-N1 and pAb C-N2 had the highest sensitivity to CPS. The minimum limitation of ICS sensitivity indicated 1.0 x 10(4) colony forming units (CFU) and a CPS concentration of 0.05 microg. The assay time for detection of S. suis antigens is less than 15 min, which is suitable for rapid detection. A cross-reactive test was also conducted, and it detected no other bacteria (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae). The cross-reactivity of other serotypes in S. suis was also investigated, and tests for serotypes of 1, 1/2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 14, and 16 were positive. This study presents the first report of a development of an ICS that enables the quantitative detection of streptococcal antigens. The S. suis ICS provides several advantages over other methods, including the speed and simplicity of use.
TI  - Occurrence of urinary tract infection in adolescent and adult women of shanty town in Dhaka City, Bangladesh.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Urinary tract infection (UTI) is commonly experienced by women of various age groups especially elderly ones. We planned to find out the prevalent microbial strains causing UTI in slum inhabitant adolescent and adult women in Dhaka City, Bangladesh. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Urine sample was collected from 462 UTI suspected female subjects. Pathogenic bacteria were identified using standard microbiological tests, and antimicrobial sensitivity profiles of the pathogens were determined. RESULTS: Bacteriuria was present in 9% of the subjects. A higher incidence (16.8%) of UTI was noted among adult women aged above 19 years. Escherichia coli (69%), Streptococcus spp. (15%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7%) were more frequently isolated from the urine samples compared to Enterococcus faecalis (3%), Staphylococcus aureus (2%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (2%) and Hafnia alvei (2%). The E. coli isolates showed complete resistance to commonly used drugs, and 58% of these isolates were multidrug resistant (MDR). Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) values for ciprofloxacin ranged between 64microg/ml and 512microg/ml, and the Minimum Bactericidal Concentration (MBC) values against the isolates were 128microg/ml or above. Isolated strains of E. coli exhibited equal extent of ciprofloxacin resistance irrespective of the presence or absence of plasmid in them. CONCLUSION: The extent of drug resistance among the uropathogens if ignored may render them uncontrollable. This study suggests regular monitoring of drug resistance phenotype of the UTI pathogens to reduce the morbidity of female UTI patients and offer better treatment strategy in the healthcare sectors of Bangladesh.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of antimicrobial features of vasopressors.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Drugs administered as intravenous infusion may be contaminated during several stages of production or preparation. However studies focusing on antibacterial effects of vasopressor drugs are very rare. This study investigates the in vitro antimicrobial activity of the clinically used forms of vasopressors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In vitro antimicrobial activities of vasopressor drugs of different concentrations were investigated by using the micro dilution technique. Microorganisms used in the test were Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis ATCC 911, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 10145, Listeria monocytogenes ATCC 43251, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Bacillus cereus 702 Roma, Mycobacterium smegmatis ATCC607, Candida albicans ATCC 60193, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae RSKK 251. Antibacterial assays were performed in Mueller-Hinton broth at pH 7.3 and antifungal assays were performed in buffered Yeast Nitrogen Base at pH 7.0. RESULTS: Two different dopamine preparations showed antimicrobial activity. No other study drug showed any antimicrobial activity. CONCLUSIONS: In our opinion, dopamine's antibacterial effects may be advantageous for inhibiting the spread of bacterial contamination during the preparation of the infusion solutions. However, it is important that strict guidelines regarding the need for sterile equipment and deliverables be adhered to during all procedures performed in the intensive care units.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of kaolinite/nanoTiO2 composites in relation to irradiation time.
AB  - The paper addresses laboratory preparation and antibacterial activity testing of  kaolinite/nanoTiO2 composite in respect of the daylight irradiation time. Kaolinite/nanoTiO2 composites with 20 and 40 wt% of TiO2 were laboratory prepared, dried at 105 degrees C and calcined at 600 degrees C. The calcination caused transformation of kaolinite to metakaolinite and origination of the metakaolinite/nanoTiO2 composite. X-ray powder diffraction, Raman and FTIR spectroscopic methods revealed titanium dioxide only in the form of anatase in all evaluated samples (non-calcined and calcined) and also transformation of kaolinite to metakaolinite after the calcination treatment. Scanning electron microscopy was used as a method for characterization of morphology and elemental composition of the studied samples. A standard microdilution test was used to determine the antibacterial activity using four human pathogenic bacterial strains (Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa). A lamp with a wide spectrum bulb simulating daylight was used for induction of photocatalysis. The antibacterial assays found all the KATI samples to have antibacterial potency with different onset of the activity when calcined samples exhibited antibacterial activity earlier than the non-calcined. Significant difference in antibacterial activity of KATI samples for different bacterial strains was not observed.
TI  - [Specific features of materials for initial pulpitis treatment].
AB  - The aim of the current study was to assess antibacterial and cytotoxic properties of Biodentine (Septodont), Rootdent (TehnoDent) and adhesive Futurabond capital EN, Cyrilliccapital ER, Cyrillic (Voco). Two lines of experiments were carried out using cements water solutions and firm tablet-like samples (made by means of special pattern). Citotoxic activity was tested on NCTC L929 mice line fibroblasts culture. All the examined materials showed antibacterial activity against E. coli, S. aureus, C. albismall es, Cyrillicans, St. faecalis, mostly evident in Futurabond and the poorest in Biodentine samples. As for cytotoxic properties, Biodentine proved not to suppress metabolic activity stimulating odontotropic impact. The results confirm the analyzed materials to be a useful tool for deep caries lesions and initial pulpitis treatment.
TI  - Health evaluation and survey of zoonotic pathogens in free-ranging capybaras (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris).
AB  - Capybaras (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris) are the world's largest rodents and play an epidemiologic role in the transmission of zoonotic pathogens, including the causative agents of Brazilian spotted fever, leptospirosis, and others. We surveyed the health of 31 free-ranging capybaras at the Alberto Lofgren State Park, Sao Paulo, Brazil using a variety of diagnostic methods. Hematology and serum chemistry were consistent with mild malnutrition and parasitism but did not indicate severe physiologic imbalance or disease. All animals were serologically negative for Rickettsia rickettsii, Leishmania spp., and Trypanosoma sp., but antibodies against rabies virus (71%), Leptospira sp. (26%), and Toxoplasma sp. (23%) were detected. Salmonella sp. was not cultured from fecal samples. Frequently cultured enterobacteria included Escherichia coli (61%), Enterococcus casseiflavus (35%), Enterococcus faecalis (35%), Enterobacter aerogenes (32%), Klebisella pneumoniae (32%), and Serratia marcescens (32%). No potentially pathogenic fungi were cultured from hair samples. Fecal parasitology revealed infection by Protozoophaga sp. (58%), Viannella spp. (23%), Strongyloides spp. (10%), and Ancilostomatidae (10%). A total of 218 ticks was retrieved from the animals: Amblyomma sp. larvae and nymphs (43%), A. dubitatum adults (52%), and A. cajennense adults (5%). The capybaras were free from most potentially zoonotic pathogens evaluated; however, the presence of Amblyomma spp. ticks (potential vectors of Rickettsia spp.) and indirect evidence of exposure to the rabies virus, Leptospira sp., and Toxoplasma sp. warrant the maintenance of public health programs and wildlife health monitoring.
TI  - Evaluation of antimicrobial activity of silver nanoparticles for carboxymethylcellulose film applications in food packaging.
AB  - In this study, silver nanoparticles were prepared and incorporated into carboxymethylcellulose films to evaluate the antimicrobial activity for food packaging applications. The techniques carried out for material characterization were: infrared spectroscopy and thermal analysis for the silver nanoparticles and films, as well as particle size distribution for the nanoparticles and water vapor permeability for the films. The antimicrobial activity of silver nanoparticles prepared by casting method was investigated. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) value of the silver nanoparticles to test Gram-positive (Enterococcus faecalis) and Gram-negative (Escherichia coli) microorganisms was carried out by the serial dilution technique, tested in triplicate to confirm the concentration used. The results were developed using the Mcfarland scale which indicates that the presence or absence of turbidity tube demonstrates the inhibition of bacteria in relation to the substance inoculated. It was found that the silver nanoparticles inhibited the growth of the tested microorganisms. The carboxymethylcellulose film embedded with silver nanoparticles showed the best antimicrobial effect against Gram-positive (E. faecalis) and Gram-negative (E. coli) bacteria (0.1 microg cm(-3)).
TI  - Antimicrobial and immunomodulatory activities of PR-39 derived peptides.
AB  - The porcine cathelicidin PR-39 is a host defence peptide that plays a pivotal role in the innate immune defence of the pig against infections. Besides direct antimicrobial activity, it is involved in immunomodulation, wound healing and several other biological processes. In this study, the antimicrobial- and immunomodulatory activity of PR-39, and N- and C-terminal derivatives of PR-39 were tested. PR-39 exhibited an unexpected broad antimicrobial spectrum including several Gram positive strains such as Bacillus globigii and Enterococcus faecalis. Of organisms tested, only Staphylococcus aureus was insensitive to PR-39. Truncation of PR-39 down to 15 (N-terminal) amino acids did not lead to major loss of activity, while peptides corresponding to the C-terminal part of PR-39 were hampered in their antimicrobial activity. However, shorter peptides were all much more sensitive to inhibition by salt. Active peptides induced ATP leakage and loss of membrane potential in Bacillus globigii and Escherichia coli, indicating a lytic mechanism of action for these peptides. Finally, only the mature peptide was able to induce IL-8 production in porcine macrophages, but some shorter peptides also had an effect on TNF-alpha production showing differential regulation of cytokine induction by PR-39 derived peptides. None of the active peptides showed high cytotoxicity highlighting the potential of these peptides for use as an alternative to antibiotics.
TI  - Amikacin-fosfomycin at a five-to-two ratio: characterization of mutation rates in microbial strains causing ventilator-associated pneumonia and interactions with commonly used antibiotics.
AB  - The amikacin-fosfomycin inhalation system (AFIS), a combination of antibiotics administered with an in-line nebulizer delivery system, is being developed for adjunctive treatment of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The in vitro characterization of amikacin-fosfomycin (at a 5:2 ratio) described here included determining resistance selection rates for pathogens that are representative of those commonly associated with VAP (including multidrug-resistant strains) and evaluating interactions with antibiotics commonly used intravenously to treat VAP. Spontaneous resistance to amikacin-fosfomycin (5:2) was not observed for most strains tested (n, 10/14). Four strains had spontaneously resistant colonies (frequencies, 4.25 x 10(-8) to 3.47 x 10(-10)), for which amikacin-fosfomycin (5:2) MICs were 2- to 8-fold higher than those for the original strains. After 7 days of serial passage, resistance (>4-fold increase over the baseline MIC) occurred in fewer strains (n, 4/14) passaged in the presence of amikacin-fosfomycin (5:2) than with either amikacin (n, 7/14) or fosfomycin (n, 12/14) alone. Interactions between amikacin-fosfomycin (5:2) and 10 comparator antibiotics in checkerboard testing against 30 different Gram-positive or Gram-negative bacterial strains were synergistic (fractional inhibitory concentration [FIC] index, </= 0.5) for 6.7% (n, 10/150) of combinations tested. No antagonism was observed. Synergy was confirmed by time-kill methodology for amikacin-fosfomycin (5:2) plus cefepime (against Escherichia coli), aztreonam (against Pseudomonas aeruginosa), daptomycin (against Enterococcus faecalis), and azithromycin (against Staphylococcus aureus). Amikacin-fosfomycin (5:2) was bactericidal at 4-fold the MIC for 7 strains tested. The reduced incidence of development of resistance to amikacin-fosfomycin (5:2) compared with that for amikacin or fosfomycin alone, and the lack of negative interactions with commonly used intravenous antibiotics, further supports the development of AFIS for the treatment of VAP.
TI  - Exploring 5-nitrofuran derivatives against nosocomial pathogens: synthesis, antimicrobial activity and chemometric analysis.
AB  - The burden of nosocomial or health care-associated infection (HCAI) is increasing worldwide. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), it is several fold higher in low- and middle-income countries. Considering the multidrug-resistant infections, the development of new and more effective drugs is crucial. Herein, two series (I and II) of 5-nitrofuran derivatives were designed, synthesized and assayed against microorganisms, including Gram-positive and -negative bacteria, and fungi. The pathogens screened was directly related to either the most currently relevant HCAI, or to multidrug-resistant infection caused by MRSA/VRSA strains, for instance. The sets I and II were composed by substituted-[N'-(5-nitrofuran-2-yl)methylene]benzhydrazide and 3-acetyl-5-(substituted-phenyl)-2-(5-nitro-furan-2-yl)-2,3-dihydro-1,3,4-oxadiazo le compounds, respectively. The selection of the substituent groups was based upon physicochemical properties, such as hydrophobicity and electronic effect. The compounds have showed better activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Enterococcus faecalis. The findings from S. aureus strain, which was more susceptible, were used to investigate the intersamples and intervariables relationships by applying chemometric methods. It is noteworthy that the compound 4-butyl-[N'-(5-nitrofuran-2-yl)methylene]benzhydrazide has showed similar MIC value to vancomycin, which is the reference drug for multidrug-resistant S. aureus infections. Taken the findings together, the 5-nitrofuran derivatives might be indeed considered as promising hits to develop novel antimicrobial drugs to fight against nosocomial infection.
TI  - Investigation of antimicrobial resistance in Escherichia coli and enterococci isolated from Tibetan pigs.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study investigated the antimicrobial resistance of Escherichia coli and enterococci isolated from free-ranging Tibetan pigs in Tibet, China, and analyzed the influence of free-ranging husbandry on antimicrobial resistance. METHODS: A total of 232 fecal samples were collected from Tibetan pigs, and the disk diffusion method was used to examine their antimicrobial resistance. Broth microdilution and agar dilution methods were used to determine minimum inhibitory concentrations for antimicrobial agents for which disks were not commercially available. RESULTS: A total of 129 E. coli isolates and 84 Enterococcus isolates were recovered from the fecal samples. All E. coli isolates were susceptible to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, and 40.4% were resistant to tetracycline. A small number of isolates were resistant to florfenicol (27.9%), ampicillin (27.9%), sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (19.4%), nalidixic acid (19.4%), streptomycin (16.2%) and ceftiofur (10.9%), and very low resistance rates to ciprofloxacin (7.8%), gentamicin (6.9%), and spectinomycin (2.3%) were observed in E. coli. All Enterococcus isolates, including E. faecium, E. faecalis, E. hirae, and E. mundtii, were susceptible to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and vancomycin, but showed high frequencies of resistance to oxacillin (92.8%), clindamycin (82.1%), tetracycline (64.3%), and erythromycin (48.8%). Resistance rates to florfenicol (17.9%), penicillin (6.0%), ciprofloxacin (3.6%), levofloxacin (1.2%), and ampicillin (1.2%) were low. Only one high-level streptomycin resistant E. faecium isolate and one high-level gentamicin resistant E. faecium isolate were observed. Approximately 20% and 70% of E. coli and Enterococcus isolates, respectively, were defined as multidrug-resistant. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, E. coli and Enterococcus isolated from free-ranging Tibetan pigs showed relatively lower resistance rates than those in other areas of China, where more intensive farming practices are used. These results also revealed that free-range husbandry and absence of antibiotic use could decrease the occurrence of antimicrobial resistance to some extent.
TI  - Intestinal alkaline phosphatase promotes gut bacterial growth by reducing the concentration of luminal nucleotide triphosphates.
AB  - The intestinal microbiota plays a pivotal role in maintaining human health and well-being. Previously, we have shown that mice deficient in the brush-border enzyme intestinal alkaline phosphatase (IAP) suffer from dysbiosis and that oral IAP supplementation normalizes the gut flora. Here we aimed to decipher the molecular mechanism by which IAP promotes bacterial growth. We used an isolated mouse intestinal loop model to directly examine the effect of exogenous IAP on the growth of specific intestinal bacterial species. We studied the effects of various IAP targets on the growth of stool aerobic and anaerobic bacteria as well as on a few specific gut organisms. We determined the effects of ATP and other nucleotides on bacterial growth. Furthermore, we examined the effects of IAP on reversing the inhibitory effects of nucleotides on bacterial growth. We have confirmed that local IAP bioactivity creates a luminal environment that promotes the growth of a wide range of commensal organisms. IAP promotes the growth of stool aerobic and anaerobic bacteria and appears to exert its growth promoting effects by inactivating (dephosphorylating) luminal ATP and other luminal nucleotide triphosphates. We observed that compared with wild-type mice, IAP-knockout mice have more ATP in their luminal contents, and exogenous IAP can reverse the ATP-mediated inhibition of bacterial growth in the isolated intestinal loop. In conclusion, IAP appears to promote the growth of intestinal commensal bacteria by inhibiting the concentration of luminal nucleotide triphosphates.
TI  - Hospital acquired infections among patients admitted in the medical and surgical  wards of a non-teaching secondary care hospital in northern India.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the incidence of Nosocomial Infection (NI) and type of  bacteriological isolates among the patients admitted in the medical and surgical wards of a non-teaching secondary care hospital in north India. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a cross-sectional hospital based study conducted in the Wards of General Medicine, General Surgery and Orthopaedic of the hospital. The patient were admitted in the department for various surgical procedures, without evidence of initial infection, were included in the study. RESULTS: A total of 176 patients were included in the study of which 82 were from Medical and 94 from Surgical ward. Overall incidence of NI was found to be 26.1% (Medical ward=28%, Surgical ward=24.5%., p=0.58). The isolation rate of Acinetobacter baumanii was (p=0.15) higher among the patients of medical ward (95.7%) than surgical ward (82.6). Escherichia coli was isolated in 89.1% and no significant difference was observed between medical and surgical wards. Klebsiella pneumoniae was isolated in 50% patients and was almost similar (p=0.37) in medical surgical wards. The isolation rate of Pseudomonos aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus and Coagulase negative staphylococci were 43.5%, 73.9%, 34.8% and 17.4% respectively. A significant difference was observed in the isolation rate of Enterococcus faecalis (p=0.007) and Coagulase negative staphylococci (p=0.002) between medical and surgical wards. Overall, among the patients who developed NI, 27.2% patient's bacterial isolates were Gram positive (Surgical=64.1, Medical=80%). CONCLUSION: The incidence of NI is increasing in the hospitals, so extensive that more care has to be taken in cleaning the wards of the hospitals.
TI  - High inhibition of Paenibacillus larvae and Listeria monocytogenes by Enterococcus isolated from different sources in Tunisia and identification of their bacteriocin genes.
AB  - A total of 300 isolates of Enterococcus, from different sources including faeces  of poultry, cow and sheep, raw milk, ricotta cheese and water, in Tunisia, were screened for their antibacterial activity. Amongst them, 59 bacteriocin-producing strains were detected and identified by molecular methods. Genes encoding for entA, entP, entB, entL50A/B, AS-48 and bac31 bacteriocins were targeted by PCR. The bacteriocin-producing strains were assigned to the species Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus hirae, Enterococcus mundtii and Enterococcus durans, respectively, 34, 19, 3, 2 and 1 isolates. Antimicrobial activity was specifically observed against different spoilage and pathogenic micro-organisms, such as Listeria monocytogenes, Listeria innocua, Listeria ivanovii, Escherichia coli, Ent. faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis and Paenibacillus larvae. The inhibitory activity was totally lost after proteinase K treatment, thereby revealing the proteinaceous nature of the antimicrobial compound. Only three bacteriocin genes, namely entP, entA and entL50A/B were detected in the isolates included in this study. Enterocins A and P were the most frequent genes and they were found in 55 (93.2%) and 39 isolates (66.1%), respectively, followed by enterocin L50A/B present in 27 isolates (45.7%). These newly identified bacteriocin-producing enterococci have the potential to be used in bio-preservation of food as well as biological control of foulbrood disease. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Enterococci possess interesting properties not only for the food industry, but also for animal and human health. The antimicrobial potential of these bacteria includes principally bacteriocin-like molecules. With the aim of identifying bacteriocinogenic strains, a collection of 300 enterococci isolated from different origins were screened and their spectrum of action, as well as the gene encoding the bacteriocin, was determined. Fifty-nine bacteriocin-producing Enterococcus showed high activity against Listeria monocytogenes and Paenibacillus larvae, the causative agent of American foulbrood. Enterocins A, P and L50A/B were found in various combinations. The most important finding of this study is the growth inhibition of P. larvae due to bacteriocin-producing Enterococcus, which opens up the possibility to use these strains to control the disease in honeybees.
TI  - Composition and biological activities of hogweed [Heracleum sphondylium L. subsp. ternatum (Velen.) Brummitt] essential oil and its main components octyl acetate and octyl butyrate.
AB  - The essential oil obtained from the fruits of hogweed (Heracleum sphondylium subsp. ternatum) growing in central Apennines (Italy) was analysed for chemical composition by gas chromatographic-flame ionisation detector (GC-FID) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The oil was composed mainly of aliphatic esters (86.9-89.5%), among them octyl acetate (54.9-60.2%) and octyl butyrate (10.1-13.4%) were the most abundant. The oil and its two major esters, octyl acetate and octyl butyrate, were tested for in vitro biological activity, namely antibacterial, antioxidant and cytotoxic, by microdilution, DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl), ABTS (2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid)) and MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) assays. Worthy of mention was only the cytotoxic activity of the oil against two tumour cell lines, i.e. A375 (human malignant melanoma) and HCT116 (human colon carcinoma) cells, with IC50 values of 48.69 and 95.83 mug/mL, respectively; the major compound responsible for this effect was octyl butyrate which displayed IC50 values of 20.19 mug/mL (100.8 muM) and 55.35 mug/mL (276.3 muM) on the same cells, respectively.
TI  - Heterologous expression and characterization of tyrosine decarboxylase from Enterococcus faecalis R612Z1 and Enterococcus faecium R615Z1.
AB  - Tyrosine decarboxylase (TDC) is responsible for tyramine production and can catalyze phenylalanine to produce beta-phenylethylamine. Enterococcus strains are a group of bacteria predominantly producing tyramine and beta-phenylethylamine in water-boiled salted duck. In this study, the heterologous expression and characterization of two TDCs from Enterococcus faecalis R612Z1 (612TDC) and Enterococcus faecium R615Z1 (615TDC) were studied. The recombinant putative proteins of 612TDC and 615TDC were heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli. 612TDC is a 620-amino-acid protein with a molecular mass of 70.0 kDa, whereas 615TDC is a 625-amino-acid protein with a molecular mass of 70.3 kDa. Both 612TDC and 615TDC showed an optimum temperature of 25 degrees C for the tyrosine and phenylalanine substrates. However, 612TDC revealed maximal activity at pH 5.5, whereas 615TDC revealed maximal activity at pH 6.0. Kinetic studies showed that 612TDC and 615TDC exhibited higher specificity for tyrosine than for phenylalanine. The catalysis abilities of both 612TDC and 615TDC for phenylalanine were restrained significantly with the increase in NaCl concentration, but this was not the case for tyrosine. This study revealed that the enzyme properties of the purified recombinant 612TDC and 615TDC were similar, although their amino acid sequences had 84% identity.
TI  - Influence of in vitro gastrointestinal digestion of fruit juices enriched with pine bark extract on intestinal microflora.
AB  - The selective antimicrobial effect of fruit juices enriched with pine bark extract (PBE) (0.5 g/L) has been studied before and after in vitro gastrointestinal digestion. PBE (a concentrate of water-soluble bioflavonoids, mainly including phenolic compounds) has been proven to have high stability to the digestion process. Pure phenolic compounds such as gallic acid had a high antimicrobial effect on Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli, maintaining the lactic acid bacteria population ( approximately 100%). Otherwise, E. coli O157:H7 only growth 50% when PBE was added to the culture media, while a slight increase on the growth of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria was observed after exposition to the bark extract. Fresh fruit juices enriched with PBE showed the highest inhibitory effect on pathogenic intestinal bacterial growth, mainly E. coli and Enterococcus faecalis. The in vitro digestion process reduced the antibacterial effect of juices against most pathogenic bacteria in approximately 10%. However, the beneficial effect of fruit juices enriched with PBE (0.5 g/L) on gut microbiota is still considerable after digestion.
TI  - In vitro comparison of the effects of probiotic, commensal and pathogenic strains on macrophage polarization.
AB  - Macrophages are important with respect to both innate and adaptive immune responses and are known to differentiate into pro-inflammatory M1- or anti-inflammatory M2-phenotypes following activation. In order to study how different bacteria affect macrophage polarization, we exposed murine RAW 264.7 macrophages to sixteen different strains representing probiotic strains, pathogens, commensals and strains of food origin. Increased inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) or arginase-1 gene expression indicates M1 or M2 polarization, respectively, and was quantified by qRT-PCR. Strains of Escherichia and Salmonella elevated iNOS expression more so than strains of Enterococcus, Lactobacillus and Lactococcus, indicating that Gram-negative strains are more potent M1 inducers. However, strain-specific responses were observed. For instance, Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 was a poor inducer of iNOS gene expression compared to the other E. coli strains, while Enterococcus faecalis Symbioflor-1 was more potent in this respect compared to all the eleven Gram-positive strains tested. Macrophage polarization was further characterized by quantifying secreted pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines. Exposure to the pathogen E. coli 042 produced a cytokine profile indicating M1 differentiation, which is in accordance with the PCR data. However, exposure to most strains resulted in either high or low secretion levels of all cytokines tested, rather than a clear M1 or M2 profile. In general, the Gram-negative strains induced high levels of cytokine secretion compared to the Gram-positive strains. Interestingly, strains of human origin had a higher impact on macrophages compared to strains of food origin.
TI  - Application of nanometal oxides in situ in nonwoven polyester fabric for the removal of bacterial indicators of pollution from wastewater.
AB  - The objective of this study is to investigate and assess the use of in situ deposit nanosilver (nAg2O) or nanocopper oxides (nCuO) into nonwoven polyester fabric (NWPF) as a safe and effective antibacterial filter of pollution from domestic wastewater. The bactericidal effect of both nAg2O and nCuO was examined against Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi) and Gram-positive bacteria (Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus) using agar diffusion disk method. In addition, the capability of nAg2O and nCuO as disinfectants for secondary treated domestic wastewater was investigated as a case study. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) confirmed the formation of nAg2O and nCuO particles with average particle sizes of 15 and 41 nm, respectively. Disk diffusion results showed that nAg2O had a higher bactericidal effect than nCuO. Moreover, the disinfection of secondary treated wastewater using 1.27 mg/cm(3) of nAg2O in the nonwoven fabric was capable of hindering 99.6% and 91.7% of total and fecal coliforms within 10 minutes with a residual value of 18 and 15 MPN-index/100 mL, respectively. The residual total and fecal coliform concentrations were far less than that stated in the national and international limits for wastewater reuse in agriculture purpose.
TI  - Graphene oxide as an anaerobic membrane scaffold for the enhancement of B. adolescentis proliferation and antagonistic effects against pathogens E. coli and S. aureus.
AB  - The impact of the gut microbiota on human health is widely perceived as the most  exciting advancement in biomedicine. The gut microbiota has been known to play a crucial role in defining states of human health and diseases, and thus becomes a potential new territory for drug targeting. Herein, graphene oxide (GO) interaction with five common human gut bacteria, B. adolescentis, L. acidophilus, E. coli, E. faecalis, and S. aureus, was studied. It was shown that, in bacterial media, GO sheets were able to form effective, anaerobic membrane scaffolds that enhanced the antagonistic activity of B. adolescentis against the pathogens E. coli andS. aureus. Data obtained using bacterial growth measurements, colony counting and 16S rRNA gene sequencing consistently indicated that GO sheets promoted proliferation of gut bacteria, particularly for B. adolescentis. Scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy images, and membrane potential measurements showed that cell membranes maintained their integrity and that no observable variations in cell morphology were induced after interaction with GO sheets, indicating good biocompatibility of GO. These results suggest the possibility of using GO sheets as efficient drug carriers in therapeutic applications to treat diseases related to the gut microbiota.
TI  - Toxicity of magnetic chitosan micro and nanoparticles as carriers for biologically active substances.
AB  - Nanoparticles of inorganic magnetic core surrounded by layers of functional coatings are potential representatives of nanostructures for immobilization of bio-substances. Magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) are often bound in aggregates due to a strong magnetic dipole, which has a lot of advantages, such as large surface area for binding biologically active substances. Chitosan is a polysaccharide polymer that is non-toxic, hydrophilic, biocompatible and has hydroxy and amino groups in its structure. Because of these chemical and biological properties it is a desirable bio-product for immobilization of enzymes and for binding of other biologically active substances. Magnetic micro and nanoparticles were synthesized with chitosan by three different methods; microemulsion process, suspension cross-linking technique and covalent binding of chitosan. Toxic effect of the prepared magnetic particles was determined as well and was examined on five different bacterial cultures; Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis and Klebsiella pneumoniae. At concentrations of 10-30 mg of magnetic particles per 0.5 McFarland Standard solution of E. coli and per 400 CFU of S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, E. faecalis in K. pneumonia, no inhibition on the chosen bacterial cultures was detected.
TI  - Antibacterial properties of water-soluble gold(I) N-heterocyclic carbene complexes.
AB  - The antibacterial properties of water-soluble gold(I) complexes [1-methyl-3-(3-sulfonatopropyl)imidazol-2-ylidene]gold(I) chloride (C1), [1-mesityl-3-(3-sulfonatopropyl)imidazol-2-ylidene]gold(I) chloride (C2), [1-(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)-3-(3-sulfonatopropyl)imidazol-2-ylidene]gold(I) chloride (C3) and [1,3-bis(2,6-diisopropyl-4-sodiumsulfonatophenyl)imidazol-2-ylidene]gold(I) chloride (C4) and the respective ligands were assessed by agar diffusion and broth macrodilution methods against Gram-positives Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis and Micrococcus luteus and the Gram-negative bacteria Yersinia ruckeri, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli. Viability after treatments was determined by direct plate count. The bactericidal activity displayed by C1 and C3 was comparable to that of AgNO3.
TI  - Synergistic antibacterial effect of honey and Herba Ocimi Basilici against some bacterial pathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the antibacterial activity of the combination of different honey brands and methanolic fraction of Herba Ocimi Basilici using agar well diffusion assay. METHODS: The antibacterial activity was determined against thirteen pathogenic bacterial clinical isolates including six gram negative (Klebsiella pneumonia, Pseudomonas aeroginosa, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, Salmonella typhimirium, Xanthomonas campestris) and six gram positive strains (Enterococcus faecalis faecalis, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium perfringens type C, Clostridium perfringens type D, Clostridium chauvoei). Agar well diffusion method was used while zones of inhibition were measured with vernier scale. RESULTS: At higher concentration, all the honey brands showed good to significant activity. The highest activity was observed for Hamdard brand honey (27.60 +/- 0.40) against Enterococcus faecalis. CONCLUSION: These results revealed that combinations of plant extracts of Herba Ocimi Basilici with honey can be used for the development of potent and novel antibacterial agents.
TI  - Aureobasidium pullulans as a source of liamocins (heavy oils) with anticancer activity.
AB  - Liamocins are structurally unique, heavier-than-water "oils" produced by certain  strains of Aureobasidium pullulans. The aim of the current study is to identify new sources of liamocins and evaluate their potential as anticancer agents. Nine strains of A. pullulans from phylogenetic clades 8, 9, and 11 were examined for the first time for production of liamocins. Strains in these clades have only been isolated from tropical environments, and all strains tested here were from various locations in Thailand. Strains RSU 9, RSU 21, and RSU 29, all from clade 11, produced from 7.0 to 8.6 g liamocins/l from medium containing 5 % sucrose. These are the highest yields of liamocins that we have found thus far. These strains also produced from 9.4 to 17 g pullulan/l. The structural identity of liamocins was confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry; differential spectra were obtained in which the dominant ion was either at about m/z 805.5 or m/z 949.6, consistent with the structure of liamocins. Liamocins from A. pullulans strains RSU 9 and RSU 21 inhibited two human breast cancer cell lines and a human cervical cancer cell line (IC50 values of 32.2 +/- 1.4 to 63.1 +/- 2.4 mug liamocins/ml) but were not toxic to a normal cell line. Liamocins weakly inhibited a strain of Enterococcus faecalis, but did not inhibit strains of Lactobacillus fermentum, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Thus, A. pullulans phylogenetic clade 11 is a promising source of liamocins, and these compounds merit further examination as potential anticancer agents.
TI  - [In vitro activity of sitafloxacin against clinical isolates in 2012].
AB  - In vitro activity of sitafloxacin (STFX) and various oral antimicrobial agents against bacterial isolates recovered from clinical specimens between January and December 2012, at different healthcare facilities in Japan was evaluated. A total of 1,620 isolates including aerobic and anaerobic organisms were available for the susceptibility testing using the microbroth dilution methods recommended by Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. The minimum inhibitory concentration of STFX at which 90% of isolates (MIC90) was 0.5 microg/mL for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and was 2 times lower than that of garenoxacin (GRNX), 4 times lower than that of moxifloxacin (MFLX), and 16 times lower than that of levofloxacin (LVFX). STFX inhibited the growth of all the isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae at 0.06 microg/mL or less. The MIC90 of STFX was 0.03 microg/mL and was 2 times lower than that of GRNX, 4 times lower than that of MFLX, and 32 times lower than that of LVFX. Against Streptococcus pyogenes, the MIC90 of STFX was 0.06 microg/mL and was 2 times lower than that of GRNX, 8 times lower than that of MFLX, and 32 times lower than that of LVFX. The MIC90 of STFX was 2 microg/mL for Enterococcus faecalis, and was 4 times lower than that of GRNX, 8 times lower than that of MFLX, and 32 times lower than that of LVFX. The MIC90 of STFX for Escherichia coli was 2 microg/mL, and the MIC90(s) of other 10 species of Enterobacteriaceae which were the lowest values of the quinolones tested ranged from 0.03 to 1 microg/mL. The MIC90 of STFX for Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates recovered from urinary infections was 4 microg/mL and was 32 times lower than those of GRNX, MFLX and LVFX. The MIC90 of STFX for P. aeruginosa isolates recovered from respiratory infections was 4 microg/mL and was 8 to 16 times lower than those of GRNX, MFLX, and LVFX. STFX inhibited the growth of all the isolates of Haemophilus influenzae at 0.004 microg/mL or less, and was 4 times lower than that of GRNX, 16 times lower than that of MFLX, and 8 times lower than that of LVFX. The MIC90 of STFX was 0.015 microg/mL for Moraxella catarrhalis, and was equal to that of GRNX, 4 times lower than those of MFLX and LVFX. The MIC90(s) of STFX ranged from 0.03 to 0.25 microg/mL for all the species of anaerobic bacteria and were the lowest values of all the antimicrobial agents tested. In conclusion, the activity of STFX against Gram-positive cocci was comparable or superior to those of GRNX, MFLX and LVFX. STFX showed the most potent activity against Gram-negative bacteria and anaerobic bacteria of all the antimicrobial agents tested in this study.
TI  - Enterococci as Indicators of Environmental Fecal Contamination
AB  - Enterococci are found in high concentrations in human feces, usually between 104  and 106 bacteria per gram wet weight (Layton, Walters, Lam, & Boehm, 2010; Slanetz & Bartley, 1957; Zubrzycki & Spaulding, 1962); see also Enterococcus Diversity, Origins in Nature, and Gut Colonization). Although enterococci usually represent less than 1% of the flora (Tendolkar, Baghdayan, & Shankar, 2003), they are usually present in the fecal consortium, but are outnumbered by other bacteria, including Escherichia coli, clostridia, and the Bacteroidales (Zubrzycki & Spaulding, 1962). Due to their ubiquity in human feces and persistence in the environment, enterococci have been adopted as indicators of human fecal pollution in water. More recently, their densities on human hands have been used as indicators of hand hygiene. The use of enterococci as indicators of human fecal pollution or contamination can be problematic, however, because enterococci are also found in animal feces (Harwood, Whitlock, & Withington, 2000; Layton, Walters, Lam, & Boehm, 2010), in soils (Byappanahalli & Fujioka, 2004; Goto & Yan, 2011), and on plants (Byappanahalli, Shively, Nevers, Sadowsky, & Whitman, 2003; Imamura, Thompson, Boehm, & Jay, 2011; Muller, Ulrich, Ott, & Muller, 2001). Although there is debate about the extent to which this happens in nature, there is evidence that enterococci are capable of replicating in extra-enteric environments, such as on beach sands (Bahirathan, Puente, & Seyfried, 1998; Zubrzycki & Spaulding, 1962) and in water containing kelp (Byappanahalli, Shively, Nevers, Sadowsky, & Whitman, 2003; Imamura, Thompson, Boehm, & Jay, 2011) and plankton (Mote, Turner, & Lipp, 2012). Identification of human-specific enterococcal species or genotypes could aid in the discrimination of human fecal contamination from other environmental sources of the organisms. Some data suggest that Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis may be more prevalent in human feces than other enterococcal species, while Enterococcus casseliflavus and Enterococcus mundtii may be more abundant in environmental reservoirs (such as on plants) than other species (Bahirathan, Puente, & Seyfried, 1998; Ferguson, Moore, Getrich, & Zhowandai, 2005; Wheeler, Hartel, Godfrey, Hill, & Segars, 2002). However, a number of species of Enterococcus have been isolated from human feces (Layton, Walters, Lam, & Boehm, 2010); Enterococcus Diversity, Origins in Nature, and Gut Colonization), so it will be difficult to derive a single host-specific indicator. It has been suggested that E. faecium that contains the enterococcal surface protein (esp) gene may be human-specific (Scott, Jenkins, Lukasik, & Rose, 2005), but esp-containing E. faecium can also be found in select animal hosts (Layton, Walters, & Boehm, 2009; Whitman, Przybyla-Kelly, Shively, & Byappanahalli, 2007). Fecal enterococci from the GI tract consortia of healthy humans are generally not virulent. Nevertheless, multidrug-resistant Enterococcus strains have emerged as leading causes of hospital-acquired infections (Tendolkar, Baghdayan, & Shankar, 2003). Vancomycin-resistant enterococci are particularly important pathogens (Willems, et al., 2005), as are esp-containing E. faecalis (Shankar, Baghdayan, Huycke, Lindahl, & Gilmore, 1999) and E. faecium (Willems, et al., 2001), as well as other types of E. faecalis and E. faecium (Wisplinghoff, Bischoff, Tallent, Seifert, Wenzel, & Edmond, 2004). It is estimated that there are 800,000 cases of enterococcal infection in the US each year, adding $500,000,000 to annual healthcare costs (Tendolkar, Baghdayan, & Shankar, 2003). Therefore, the presence of enterococci in the environment and on hands may have important direct health implications.
TI  - Green synthesis of silver nanoparticles using Alternanthera dentata leaf extract  at room temperature and their antimicrobial activity.
AB  - A green rapid biogenic synthesis of silver nanoparticles AgNPs using Alternanthera dentata (A. dentata) aqueous extract was demonstrated in this present study. The formation of silver nanoparticles was confirmed by Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) at 430nm using UV-visible spectrophotometer. The reduction of silver ions to silver nanoparticles by A. dentata extract was completed within 10min. Synthesized nanoparticles were characterized using UV-visible spectroscopy; Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The extracellular silver nanoparticles synthesis by aqueous leaf extract demonstrates rapid, simple and inexpensive method comparable to chemical and microbial methods. The colloidal solution of silver nanoparticles were found to exhibit antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumonia and, Enterococcus faecalis.
TI  - Antibacterial effect of Iranian green-tea-containing mouthrinse vs chlorhexidine  0.2%: an in vitro study.
AB  - PURPOSE: Considering the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties of green tea, this study aimed to evaluate the antibacterial effect of mouthrinses containing green tea extract vs 0.2% chlorhexidine on selected microorganisms in vitro. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The antibacterial activity of both mouthrinses and the pure green tea extract was assessed by using disk diffusion and the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) methods against five microorganisms: Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aerogenosa and Escherichia coli. Growth inhibition zones were measured in mm after 24 h of incubation at 37 degrees C. The two mouthrinses were assessed at concentrations of 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256 and 512 mg/ml to determine the MIC, which was interpreted as the lowest concentration of the agent that completely inhibited the growth of the test species. RESULTS: 0.2% chlorhexidine produced a larger zone of growth inhibition than did the mouthrinse made of green tea extract (P < 0.01). Paradoxically, the growth inhibition zones of the tested bacteria were significantly larger in pure extract of green tea than in 0.2% chlorhexidine (P < 0.01). The chlorhexidine mouthrinse inhibited the growth of all tested species and exhibited significantly lower MICs than did the green tea mouthrinse (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Even though the mouthrinse made with green tea extract presented an in vitro antimicrobial activity inferior to 0.2% chlorhexidine, the pure extract had considerable bactericidal effect.
TI  - Genomics-guided discovery of endophenazines from Kitasatospora sp. HKI 714.
AB  - In this study we report on the genomics-guided exploration of the metabolic potential of the newly discovered strain Kitasatospora sp. HKI 714. The bioinformatics analysis of the whole genome sequence revealed the presence of a biosynthetic gene cluster presumably responsible for the biosynthesis of formerly unknown endophenazine derivatives. A 200 L cultivation combined with bioactivity-guided isolation techniques revealed four new natural products belonging to the endophenazines and the 5,10-dihydrophenazines. Detailed descriptions of their biological effects, mainly focused on antimicrobial properties against several mycobacteria, are given.
TI  - Antibacterial, anti-inflammatory and probiotic potential of Enterococcus hirae isolated from the rumen of Bos primigenius.
AB  - In the present study bacterial strains were isolated from the rumen fluids of Bos primigenius and investigated their in vitro probiotic properties with potent antibacterial activity and anti-inflammatory effects. 9 g positive bacterial isolates were obtained and three isolates could able to tolerate gastric conditions, high bile salt concentrations and exhibited significant bactericidal effect against the enteric pathogens Vibrio cholera, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterobacter aerogens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhi. Moreover it showed above 70% cell surface hydrophobicity, significant low-invasion ability and potential adherence capacity in Caco-2 cells when compared with the control. The proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha) was greatly reduced in rumen bacteria treatment and ARBS-1 modulate the immune response by activating the IL-4 secretion in parallel to TNF-alpha suppression. The 16s rRNA gene sequence of the active isolates were identified as Enterococcus hirae (ARBS-1), Pediococcus acidilactici (ARBS-4) and Bacillus licheniformis (ARBS-7). This study revealed the probiotic bactericidal properties of E. hirae obtained from the rumen of B. primigenius with potential antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects. Future studies with the strains may yield some novel probiotic product for livestock's.
TI  - EndoE from Enterococcus faecalis hydrolyzes the glycans of the biofilm inhibiting protein lactoferrin and mediates growth.
AB  - Glycosidases are widespread among bacteria. The opportunistic human pathogen Enterococcus faecalis encodes several putative glycosidases but little is known about their functions. The identified endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase EndoE has activity on the N-linked glycans of the human immunoglobulin G (IgG). In this report we identified the human glycoprotein lactoferrin (hLF) as a new substrate for EndoE. Hydrolysis of the N-glycans from hLF was investigated using lectin blot, UHPLC and mass spectrometry, showing that EndoE releases major glycoforms from this protein. hLF was shown to inhibit biofilm formation of E. faecalis in vitro. Glycans of hLF influence the binding to E. faecalis, and EndoE-hydrolyzed hLF inhibits biofilm formation to lesser extent than intact hLF indicating that EndoE prevents the inhibition of biofilm. In addition, hLF binds to a surface-associated enolase of E. faecalis. Culture experiments showed that the activity of EndoE enables E. faecalis to use the glycans derived from lactoferrin as a carbon source indicating that they could be used as nutrients in vivo when no other preferred carbon source is available. This report adds important information about the enzymatic activity of EndoE from the commensal and opportunist E. faecalis. The activity on the human glycoprotein hLF, and the functional consequences with reduced inhibition of biofilm formation highlights both innate immunity functions of hLF and a bacterial mechanism to evade this innate immunity function. Taken together, our results underline the importance of glycans in the interplay between bacteria and the human host, with possible implications for both commensalism and opportunism.
TI  - Antibacterial properties and mode of action of new triaryl butene citrate compounds.
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the antibacterial activity of newly synthesized triaryl butene analogues of tamoxifen. Several compounds were synthesized and converted to citrate salts to ensure greater solubility. Four compounds showed significant antibacterial activity at micromolar concentrations against Gram-positive and Gram-negative foodborne pathogens including Listeria monocytogenes, Listeria ivanovii, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. Two compounds at 50 muM, caused only 7.8 and 11% hemolysis. One of these as well as the remaining two caused high K(+) and Na(+) efflux from bacterial cells. Ultrastructural alterations were also visible using transmission electron microscopy, which revealed severe damage of the inner or outer membrane of E. coli. L. ivanovii showed swelling, corrugations and similar damage indicating a loss of cell-wall integrity. Organometallic compounds may offer interesting opportunities for the design of novel classes of antimicrobial compounds.
TI  - Novel benzoxazoles: synthesis and antibacterial, antifungal, and antitubercular activity against antibiotic-resistant and -sensitive microbes.
AB  - A new series of 5-(p-substituted benzamido/phenylacetamido)-2-(p-tert-butylphenyl)benzoxazole derivatives were synthesized and evaluated for their antibacterial, antifungal, and antimycobacterial activities against antibiotic-resistant and -sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis as well as against Candida albicans and Candida krusei. The compounds possessed broad-spectrum activity against all of the tested Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and yeasts, their minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) ranging between 16-128 microg/ml. One compound exhibited significant antibacterial activity (16 microg/ml) against an antibiotic-resistant Enterococcus faecalis isolate, having twice the potency of the compared standard drugs vancomycin and gentamycin sulfate. The compounds also showed moderate antitubercular activity with MIC values between 8-128 microg/ml against Mycobacterium tuberculosis and its clinical isolate.
TI  - Antibacterial substances from marine algae isolated from Jeddah coast of Red sea, Saudi Arabia.
AB  - Marine algae are known to produce a wide variety of bioactive secondary metabolites and several compounds have been derived from them for prospective development of novel drugs by the pharmaceutical industries. However algae of the Red sea have not been adequately explored for their potential as a source of bioactive substances. In this context Ulva reticulata, Caulerpa occidentalis, Cladophora socialis, Dictyota ciliolata, and Gracilaria dendroides isolated from Red sea coastal waters of Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, were evaluated for their potential for bioactivity. Extracts of the algae selected for the study were prepared using ethanol, chloroform, petroleum ether and water, and assayed for antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli ATCC 25322, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Stapylococcus aureus ATCC 29213, and Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212. It was found that chloroform was most effective followed by ethanol, petroleum ether and water for the preparation of algal extract with significant antibacterial activities, respectively. Results also indicated that the extracts of red alga G. dendroides were more efficient against the tested bacterial strains followed by green alga U. reticulata, and brown algae D. ciliolata. Chemical analyses showed that G. dendroides recorded the highest percentages of the total fats and total proteins, followed by U. reticulata, and D. ciliolate. Among the bioflavonoids determined Rutin, Quercetin and Kaempherol were present in high percentages in G. dendroides, U. reticulata, and D. ciliolate. Estimation of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids revealed that palmitic acid was present in highest percentage in all the algal species analyzed. Amino acid analyses indicated the presence of free amino acids in moderate contents in all the species of algae. The results indicated scope for utilizing these algae as a source of antibacterial substances.
TI  - Analysis of the promoters involved in enterocin AS-48 expression.
AB  - The enterocin AS-48 is the best characterized antibacterial circular protein in prokaryotes. It is a hydrophobic and cationic bacteriocin, which is ribosomally synthesized by enterococcal cells and post-translationally cyclized by a head-to-tail peptide bond. The production of and immunity towards AS-48 depend upon the coordinated expression of ten genes organized in two operons, as-48ABC (where genes encoding enzymes with processing, secretion, and immunity functions are adjacent to the structural as-48A gene) and as-48C1DD1EFGH. The current study describes the identification of the promoters involved in AS-48 expression. Seven putative promoters have been here amplified, and separately inserted into the promoter-probe vector pTLR1, to create transcriptional fusions with the mCherry gene used as a reporter. The activity of these promoter regions was assessed measuring the expression of the fluorescent mCherry protein using the constitutive pneumococcal promoter PX as a reference. Our results revealed that only three promoters PA, P2(2) and PD1 were recognized in Enterococcus faecalis, Lactococcus lactis and Escherichia coli, in the conditions tested. The maximal fluorescence was obtained with PX in all the strains, followed by the P2(2) promoter, which level of fluorescence was 2-fold compared to PA and 4-fold compared to PD1. Analysis of putative factors influencing the promoter activity in single and double transformants in E. faecalis JH2-2 demonstrated that, in general, a better expression was achieved in presence of pAM401-81. In addition, the P2(2) promoter could be regulated in a negative fashion by genes existing in the native pMB-2 plasmid other than those of the as-48 cluster, while the pH seems to affect differently the as-48 promoter expression.
TI  - The antibacterial activity, antioxidant activity and selectivity index of leaf extracts of thirteen South African tree species used in ethnoveterinary medicine to treat helminth infections.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diseases caused by bacteria remain a major challenge globally and particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. The plants used in this study have been used in South Africa to treat helminth infections in livestock and humans. In a previous study we found a correlation between antifungal and anthelmintic activity in some cases. In this study we examined other potential uses of these thirteen plant species by determining the antibacterial and antioxidant activity of the leaf acetone extracts.The antibacterial activity was determined by using a serial microdilution method against Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis. Bioautography was used to determine the number of antibacterial compounds. The antioxidant activity was determined using the ABTS and DPPH methods. RESULTS: Maesa lanceolata and Leucosidea sericea with an MIC of 0.02 mg/ml had excellent antibacterial activity against Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. There was a poor correlation between antioxidant activity and antibacterial activity with R2 = 0.143. This is because antibacterial activity is mainly related to non-polar compounds and antioxidant activity to polar compounds. Maesa lanceolata extracts had a low cytotoxicity with a selectivity index of 5.2, 2.6, 2.6 and 1.3 for P. aeruginosa, E. faecalis, E. coli and S. aureus respectively. Strychnos mitis extracts had a therapeutic index of 1.1 for E. coli. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that plant extracts of some species used in ethnoveterinary medicine as anthelmintic may also have excellent antibacterial activity.
TI  - Effects of single- and multi-strain probiotics on biofilm formation and in vitro  adhesion to bladder cells by urinary tract pathogens.
AB  - PURPOSE: There is increasing evidence that probiotic bacteria can inhibit and/or  prevent urinary tract infections. Possible mechanisms include prevention of adhesion of pathogens to the bladder epithelium and inhibition of biofilm formation. Currently there is interest in the comparative efficacy of single probiotics vs. strain mixtures. We have therefore tested the inhibitory activity of four single probiotics and four probiotic mixtures towards the urinary tract pathogens Escherichia coli NCTC 9001 and Enterococcus faecalis NCTC 00775. METHODS: Inhibition of biofilm formation by cell-free supernatants was tested using the Crystal Violet assay, while prevention of pathogen adhesion to host cells was tested by using bladder cancer cells as a model for the human urinary tract. RESULTS: Under pH-controlled conditions, there was no significant inhibition of biofilm formation by any treatment. Without pH control, 5/8 treatments significantly inhibited biofilm production by E. coli, while 5/8 treatments inhibited production by E. faecalis. Using data from all Crystal Violet assays, there was no significant difference in the ability of single- and multi-strain probiotics to inhibit biofilm formation. In the cell culture assays, all treatments were able to significantly reduce numbers of pathogenic cells adhering to host cells by 2.5-3.5 logs. No significant difference was observed between the displacement caused by single strains and mixtures for either pathogen. CONCLUSIONS: Inhibition of biofilm seems to be a major mechanism of urinary tract pathogen exclusion, related to, and possibly dependent upon, the probiotic ability to reduce environmental pH. Exclusion via competition of binding sites is a possible in vivo mechanism for these probiotics. If an additive or synergistic effect exists between strains within a mixture, it does not manifest itself in a greater effect through these two inhibitory mechanisms.
TI  - Recombinant human lipocalin 2 acts as an antibacterial agent to prevent platelet  contamination.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial contamination of platelet products is the major infectious  risk in blood transfusion medicine, which can result in life-threatening sepsis in recipient. Lipocalin 2 (Lcn2) is an iron-sequestering protein in the antibacterial innate immune response, which inhibit bacterial growth. This study was aimed to evaluate the antibacterial property of Lcn2 in preventing bacterial contamination of platelets. METHODS: Recombinant Lcn2 was expressed in a eukaryotic expression system and following purification and characterization of the recombinant Lcn2, its minimum inhibitory concentration was determined. Then, platelet concentrates were inoculated with various concentrations of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Enterococcus faecalis, and the antibacterial effects of Lcn2 was evaluated at 20-24 degrees C. RESULTS: Results revealed that Lcn2 effectively inhibited the growth of 1.5 x 10(4) CFU/ml S. epidermidis, P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae, E. coli, and E. faecalis at 40 ng/ml. At this concentration, Lcn2 also inhibited the growth of 1.5 x 10(3) CFU/ml Staphylococcus aureus and Proteus mirabilis. CONCLUSION: Recombinant Lcn2 inhibited growth of a variety of platelet-contaminating bacteria. Therefore, supplementation of platelet concentrates with Lcn2 may reduce bacterial contamination.
TI  - Microwave-assisted preparation of azachalcones and their N-alkyl derivatives with antimicrobial activities.
AB  - Two new azachalcones were prepared by both Claisen-Schmidt condensation and a simple environmentally trendy microwave-assisted method. Ten new N-alkyl (C6,8,10,12,14)-substituted azachalconium bromides (3a-e, 4a-e) were prepared from compounds 1 and 2 with corresponding alkyl halides. The antimicrobial activities of all the compounds were tested against Enterococcus faecalis, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus micro-organisms.
TI  - The interplay between the innate immune system and the microbiota.
AB  - The human gastrointestinal tract harbors one of the highest densities of microorganisms on earth, called the microbiota. In fact, the number of microbial cells in the intestine outnumbers the amount of human cells of the entire organism by a factor of 10. As such, a human being is more and more perceived as a super-organism consisting of a eukaryotic and a prokaryotic part. The compartment mediating the communication between both parts is the innate immune system and its various microbe-sensing pattern-recognition receptors. Co-evolution of the microbiota with the innate immune system has resulted in elaborate interdependency and feedback mechanisms by which both systems control mutual homeostasis. Here, we review the most important innate immune-microbiota interdependencies known to date. While microbial sensing by pattern-recognition receptors is required for stable microbial composition, the presence of the microbiota, in turn, is necessary for proper development and function of the immune system.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of the marine alkaloids, clathrodin and oroidin, and their synthetic analogues.
AB  - Marine organisms produce secondary metabolites that may be valuable for the development of novel drug leads as such and can also provide structural scaffolds for the design and synthesis of novel bioactive compounds. The marine alkaloids, clathrodin and oroidin, which were originally isolated from sponges of the genus, Agelas, were prepared and evaluated for their antimicrobial activity against three bacterial strains (Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli) and one fungal strain (Candida albicans), and oroidin was found to possess promising Gram-positive antibacterial activity. Using oroidin as a scaffold, 34 new analogues were designed, prepared and screened for their antimicrobial properties. Of these compounds, 12 exhibited >80% inhibition of the growth of at least one microorganism at a concentration of 50 microM. The most active derivative was found to be 4-phenyl-2-aminoimidazole 6h, which exhibited MIC(9)(0) (minimum inhibitory concentration) values of 12.5 microM against the Gram-positive bacteria and 50 microM against E. coli. The selectivity index between S. aureus and mammalian cells, which is important to consider in the evaluation of a compound's potential as an antimicrobial lead, was found to be 2.9 for compound 6h.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of synthetic curcumin derivatives: 3,5-bis(benzylidene)-4-piperidone (EF24) and EF24-dimer linked via diethylenetriaminepentacetic acid (EF2DTPA).
AB  - Curcumin is well known for its antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties. However, since systemic absorption and bioavailability of curcumin from gastrointestinal tract is considerably poor, synthetic curcuminoids are being developed as better alternatives. Two curcumin derivatives: 3,5-bis(benzylidene)-4-piperidone (EF24) and EF24-dimer linked via diethylenetriaminepentacetic acid (EF2DTPA), were included in this study. We investigated the antibacterial activity of EF24 and EF2DTPA against Gram-negative (Escherichia coli) and Gram-positive (Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus) bacteria. We also studied the effects of EF24 and EF2DTPA on uptake and localization of pHrodo-labeled E. coli in the acidic compartments (phagolysosomes) of dendritic cells (DCs) under in vitro conditions. Our results demonstrate that treatment with EF24 and EF2DTPA directly suppresses the bacterial growth. However, these compounds do not affect the bacterial uptake or localization in the DCs.
TI  - Cerecidins, novel lantibiotics from Bacillus cereus with potent antimicrobial activity.
AB  - Lantibiotics are ribosomally synthesized and posttranslationally modified antimicrobial peptides that are widely produced by Gram-positive bacteria, including many species of the Bacillus group. In the present study, one novel gene cluster coding lantibiotic cerecidins was unveiled in Bacillus cereus strain As 1.1846 through genomic mining and PCR screening. The designated cer locus is different from that of conventional class II lantibiotics in that it included seven tandem precursor cerA genes, one modification gene (cerM), two processing genes (cerT and cerP), one orphan regulator gene (cerR), and two immunity genes (cerF and cerE). In addition, one unprecedented quorum sensing component, comQXPA, was inserted between cerM and cerR. The expression of cerecidins was not detected in this strain of B. cereus, which might be due to repressed transcription of cerM. We constitutively coexpressed cerA genes and cerM in Escherichia coli, and purified precerecidins were proteolytically processed with the endoproteinase GluC and a truncated version of putative serine protease CerP. Thus, two natural variants of cerecidins A1 and A7 were obtained which contained two terminal nonoverlapping thioether rings rarely found in lantibiotics. Both cerecidins A1 and A7 were active against a broad spectrum of Gram-positive bacteria. Cerecidin A7, especially its mutant Dhb13A, showed remarkable efficacy against multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MDRSA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (VRE), and even Streptomyces.
TI  - In Vitro antibacterial efficacy of 21 Indian timber-yielding plants against multidrug-resistant bacteria causing urinary tract infection.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To screen methanolic leaf extracts of 21 timber-yielding plants for antibacterial activity against nine species of uropathogenic bacteria isolated from clinical samples of a hospital (Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter baumannii, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). METHODS: Bacterial strains were subjected to antibiotic sensitivity tests by the Kirby-Bauer's disc diffusion method. The antibacterial potentiality of leaf extracts was monitored by the agar-well diffusion method with multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains of nine uropathogens. RESULTS: Two Gram-positive isolates, E. faecalis and S. aureus, were resistant to 14 of the 18 antibiotics used. Gram-negative isolates A. baumannii, C. freundii, E. aerogenes, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis, and P. aeruginosa were resistant to 10, 12, 9, 11, 11, 10, and 11 antibiotics, respectively, of the 14 antibiotics used. Methanolic leaf extracts of Anogeissus acuminata had the maximum zone of inhibition size-29 mm against S. aureus and 28 mm against E. faecalis and P. aeruginosa. Cassia tora had 29 mm as the zone of inhibition size for E. faecalis, E. aerogenes, and P. aeruginosa. Based on the minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration values, the most effective 10 plants against uropathogens could be arranged in decreasing order as follows: C. tora > A. acuminata > Schleichera oleosa > Pterocarpus santalinus > Eugenia jambolana > Bridelia retusa > Mimusops elengi > Stereospermum kunthianum > Tectona grandis > Anthocephalus cadamba. The following eight plants had moderate control capacity: Artocarpus heterophyllus, Azadirachta indica, Dalbergia latifolia, Eucalyptus citriodora, Gmelina arborea, Pongamia pinnata, Pterocarpus marsupium, and Shorea robusta. E. coli, followed by A. baumannii, C. freundii, E. aerogenes, P. mirabilis, and P. aeruginosa were controlled by higher amounts/levels of leaf extracts. Phytochemicals of all plants were qualitatively estimated. CONCLUSIONS: A majority of timber-yielding plants studied had in vitro control capacity against MDR uropathogenic bacteria.
TI  - Etiology of peritonitis.
AB  - AIM: To determine the etiology of peritonitis, as well as the sensitivity of isolated bacteria to antibiotics. METHODS: Study was performed at the Surgical Clinic, Department of Anesthesiology and Reanimation, Department of Microbiology, Department of Clinical Pharmacology of University Clinical Centre (UCC) Tuzla. In a prospective study, starting from 1.6.2009. to 30.6.2010., was 60 patients analyzed who underwent surgery for acute peritonitis in the Surgical Clinic, UCC Tuzla. RESULTS: After microbiological processing of the content of the operative field, wound swabs and smears of drainage, we isolated Gram positive coccid bacteria: Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus in 18.36%, Staphylococcus aureus in 12.6%, while Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecum were found in 3.44% isolates. In the group of Gram-negative bacteria we isolated: Escherichia coli in 15.51%, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae in 10.34% of the cases. The sensitivity of coagulase-negative Staphylococcus was largest to vancomycin (100%), and lowest to penicillin (10%) and Staphylococcus aureus sensitivity was largest to vancomycin and amoxicillin-clavulanate (100%) and lowest to penicillins (3.7%). Sensitivity of the facultative anaerobic Gram-negative bacilli was highest to carbapenems 95-100%, and lowest to penicillin preparations 0-56%. CONCLUSION: Based on the results of microbiological findings of 83.33% patients empirical antibiotic therapy was appropriately involved, and in 16.67% was inadequate and later changed, following the results of microbiological findings. This study indicates the importance and validity of microbiological diagnostics to determine the etiology of peritonitis and appropriate selection of antibiotics to treat these infections, with the required surgical treatment.
TI  - Vellozia flavicans Mart. ex Schult. hydroalcoholic extract inhibits the neuromuscular blockade induced by Bothrops jararacussu venom.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Snakebite is a significant public health issue in tropical countries. In Brazil, some of the most common snake envenomations are from Bothrops. Bothrops bites trigger local and systemic effects including edema, pain, erythema, cyanosis, infections, and necrosis. Vellozia flavicans is a plant from the Brazilian "cerrado" (savanna) that is popularly used as an anti-inflammatory medicine. Since inflammation develops quickly after Bothrops bites, which can lead to infection, the aim of the present study was to observe possible anti-snake venom and antimicrobial activities of V. flavicans (Vf). METHODS: The chromatographic profile of the main constituents from the Vf leaf hydroalcoholic extract was obtained by thin-layer chromatography (TLC). The anti-snake venom activity was measured by Vf's ability to neutralize the in vitro neuromuscular blockade caused by Bothrops jararacussu venom (Bjssu) in a mouse phrenic nerve-diaphragm model (PND). After a 20 min incubation, preparations of PND were added to Tyrode's solution (control); Vf (0.2, 0.5, 1, and 2 mg/mL); 40 mug/mL Bjssu; pre-incubation for 30 min with Bjssu and 1 mg/mL Vf; and a Bjssu pretreated preparation (for 10 min) followed by 1 mg/mL Vf. Myographic recording was performed, and the contractile responses were recorded. The antimicrobial activity (minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC] and minimum bactericidal concentration [MBC]) was obtained for Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Enterococcus faecalis, using gentamicin and vancomycin as positive controls. RESULTS: TLC analysis yielded several compounds from Vf, such as flavonoids (quercetin) and phenolic acids (chlorogenic acid). Bjssu completely blocked the contractile responses of PND preparations, while Vf preserved 97% (+/-10%) of the contractile responses when incubated with Bjssu. In the PND pretreated with Bjssu, Vf was able to inhibit the neuromuscular blockade progress. MIC and MBC of Vf ranged from 2.5 to 5.0 mg/mL for P. aeruginosa and S. aureus strains, while no antimicrobial activity was observed for E. coli and E. faecalis. CONCLUSIONS: The hydroalcoholic extract from Vf leaves was able to neutralize and decrease the in vitro neuromuscular blockade caused by Bjssu. However, it did not show significant antimicrobial activity against the tested bacteria.
TI  - New hydrazines with sulphonamidic structure: synthesis,characterization and biological activity.
AB  - Infections caused by bacterial species are common in immunocompromised patients and carry significant treatment costs and mortality. The emerging resistance of microorganisms to some synthetic antimicrobial agents makes it necessary to continue the research for new antimicrobial drugs. AIM: To design new sulphonamide compounds with potential antibacterial and antioxidant activity. MATERIAL AND METHODS: New N-hydrazino acetyl-sulphonamides were prepared by condensation of some sulphonamides with chloroacetyl chloride and amination of intermediate compounds with hydrazine hydrate. RESULTS: The synthesized compounds were screened for their antibacterial activity against Gram positive (Klebsiellapneumoniae. Proteus vulgaris, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis) and Gram negative bacterial strains (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli). Some of them were found to have good antibacterial activity. The antioxidant activity of these compounds was also tested using different methods: total antioxidant capacity, reducing power, and DPPH radical scavenging activity. CONCLUSIONS: Chemical modulations performed on sulphonamide structure have a good influence on the biological activity of the synthesized compounds, especially on their antioxidant effects.
TI  - Chemical composition, antibacterial and cytotoxic activities of the essential oil from the flowers of Tunisian Convolvulus althaeoides L.
AB  - This study describes the chemical composition and evaluates the antibacterial and the cytotoxic effects of the essential oil from the flowers of Convolvulus althaeoides. Its chemical composition, determined by GC and GC-MS, is reported for the first time. A total of 24 compounds, accounting for 95.5% of the total oil, have been identified. The oil was characterised by a high proportion of sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (36.3%), followed by oxygenated sesquiterpenes (34.7%) and oxygenated monoterpenes (24.5%). The main compounds were germacrene D (12.5%), T-cadinol (11.8%) and verbenone (6.9%). The essential oil was tested for its antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis and the clinical strain Acinetobacter sp. as well as facts cytotoxic activity towards the human breast cancer cells MCF-7. This oil did not exhibit significant antibacterial activity against the tested bacteria; however, it exerted a significant cytotoxic activity against the tested cell line (IC(5)(0) = 8.16 mug/mL).
TI  - [Treatment of Fournier's gangrene].
AB  - Fournier's gangrene is a necrotizing fasciitis and soft-tissue infection of the perineal region. The clinical course of the disease, in many cases, is fulminant. This case presents a patient with symptoms of Fournier's gangrene that developed during hospitalization following a vehicular accident. The disease was diagnosed six days into hospitalization. The patient underwent numerous surgical procedures. Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis were found in a culture of the surgical wound. Because of the progressing septic shock, the patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit. Treatment was based on extensive soft tissue debridement, antibiotic and hyperbaric-oxygen therapy. The patient was discharged 7 weeks after hospitalization.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of indicator bacteria isolated from chickens in Southeast Asian countries (Vietnam, Indonesia and Thailand).
AB  - To determine the prevalence of indicator bacteria resistant to antimicrobials among poultry in three Southeast Asian countries (Vietnam, Indonesia and Thailand), we examined the antimicrobial susceptibilities of commensal bacteria isolated from chickens. In total, 125, 117 and 180 isolates of Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium, respectively, were used to test for antimicrobial susceptibility. Bacterial resistance to antimicrobial treatment was most frequently observed with oxytetracycline with a prevalence of 73.6% (E. coli), 69.2% (E. faecalis) and 92.2% (E. faecium). Resistance to fluoroquinolones, which are critically important medicines, was also frequently observed in E. coli (48.8%), E. faecalis (17.9%) and E. faecium (82.8%). The prevalence of indicator bacteria resistant to most of the antimicrobials tested in these countries was higher than those for developed countries. The factors underlying antimicrobial resistance may include inappropriate and/or excessive use of antimicrobials. These results highlight the need for monitoring the emergence and prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in developing countries.
TI  - Diagnosis of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID): intra-operative findings and comparison of vaginal and intra-abdominal cultures.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is frequent in adolescents and younger women. Diagnosis is usually based on the clinical findings, and the threshold for empiric antibiotic therapy should be low. However, at least in cases of resistance toward therapy or deterioration of symptoms, laparoscopic evaluation can be helpful. METHODS: We searched the hospital charts for in-house patients who were treated for PID or tubo-ovarian abscess between 2007 and 2010. In cases with both vaginal and intra-abdominal bacterial cultures, results of those were compared. RESULTS: 73 patients with suspected PID or tubo-ovarian abscess were included. Median patients' age was 40 years (18-88), 18 of 73 (24.7 %) patients had an IUD at the time of consultation. 58 patients underwent laparoscopy or laparotomy. In 41 patients (70.7 %) tubo-ovarian abscess could be confirmed, four patients had differential gynecologic diagnoses, and two patients appendicitis. In vaginal swabs, most frequent bacteria were Streptococcus sp. (28.5 %), Escherichia coli (22.2 %), Enterococcus faecalis (15.9 %), and Staphylococcus sp. (9.5 %). In eight patients (11 %) Chlamydia trachomatis could be found, there was no case of Neisseria gonorrhea. In 33 patients both vaginal and abdominal cultures were available. In nine cases (27.3 %), identical bacteria could be found, however, 11 cases (33.3 %) showed different results. CONCLUSION: In severe cases of PID, laparoscopic evaluation and taking an intra-abdominal bacterial culture are helpful for the confirmation of diagnosis, accurate microbiologic testing and specific therapy.
TI  - Effect of proton pump inhibitors on in vitro activity of tigecycline against several common clinical pathogens.
AB  - In this study, we evaluated the effect of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) on in vitro antimicrobial activity of tigecycline against several species of clinical pathogens. Clinical non-duplicate isolates of Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis and three species of Enterobacteriaceae (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia and Enterobacter cloacae) were collected from a tertiary hospital and their MICs of tigecycline alone and in combination with PPIs (omeprazole, lansoprazole and pantoprazole) were determined. With one randomly selected isolate of each bacterial species, an in vitro time-kill study was performed for the confirmation of the effect of PPIs on tigecycline activity. The MIC changes after PPIs addition correlated with the PPIs concentrations in the test media. Compared with tigecycline alone, the addition of 5 mg/L PPIs could increase the MICs of tigecycline by 0 to 2-fold and the addition of 50 mg/L PPIs could increase the MICs of tigecycline by 4 to >128-fold. The time-kill study confirmed that the addition of PPIs could affect the in vitro activity of tigecycline. Even at low concentration (5 mg/L) of omeprazole and pantoprazole, antagonistic effect could be observed in E. cloacae and E. faecalis strains. We conclude that In vitro activity of tigecycline can be influenced by the presence of PPIs in a concentration-dependent manner.
TI  - Evaluation of epidemiological cut-off values indicates that biocide resistant subpopulations are uncommon in natural isolates of clinically-relevant microorganisms.
AB  - To date there are no clear criteria to determine whether a microbe is susceptible to biocides or not. As a starting point for distinguishing between wild-type and resistant organisms, we set out to determine the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) distributions for four common biocides; triclosan, benzalkonium chloride, chlorhexidine and sodium hypochlorite for 3319 clinical isolates, with a particular focus on Staphylococcus aureus (N = 1635) and Salmonella spp. (N = 901) but also including Escherichia coli (N = 368), Candida albicans (N = 200), Klebsiella pneumoniae (N = 60), Enterobacter spp. (N = 54), Enterococcus faecium (N = 53), and Enterococcus faecalis (N = 56). From these data epidemiological cut-off values (ECOFFs) are proposed. As would be expected, MBCs were higher than MICs for all biocides. In most cases both values followed a normal distribution. Bimodal distributions, indicating the existence of biocide resistant subpopulations were observed for Enterobacter chlorhexidine susceptibility (both MICs and MBCs) and the susceptibility to triclosan of Enterobacter (MBC), E. coli (MBC and MIC) and S. aureus (MBC and MIC). There is a concern on the potential selection of antibiotic resistance by biocides. Our results indicate however that resistance to biocides and, hence any potential association with antibiotic resistance, is uncommon in natural populations of clinically relevant microorganisms.
TI  - In vitro activity of rifaximin against isolates from patients with small intestinal bacterial overgrowth.
AB  - Rifaximin, a non-absorbable rifamycin derivative, has published clinical efficacy in the alleviation of symptoms in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) is associated with the pathogenesis of IBS. This study describes for the first time the antimicrobial effect of rifaximin against SIBO micro-organisms from humans. Fluid was aspirated from the third part of the duodenum from 567 consecutive patients; quantitative cultures diagnosed SIBO in 117 patients (20.6%). A total of 170 aerobic micro-organisms were isolated and the in vitro efficacy of rifaximin was studied by (i) minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) testing by a microdilution technique and (ii) time-kill assays using bile to simulate the small intestinal environment. At a breakpoint of 32 mug/mL, rifaximin inhibited in vitro 85.4% of Escherichia coli, 43.6% of Klebsiella spp., 34.8% of Enterobacter spp., 54.5% of other Enterobacteriaceae spp., 82.6% of non-Enterobacteriaceae Gram-negative spp., 100% of Enterococcus faecalis, 100% of Enterococcus faecium and 100% of Staphylococcus aureus. For the time-kill assays, 11 E. coli, 15 non-E. coli Gram-negative enterobacteria and three E. faecalis isolates were studied. Rifaximin produced a >3 log10 decrease in the starting inoculum against most of the tested isolates at 500 mug/mL after 24h of growth. The results indicate that rifaximin has a potent effect on specific small bowel flora associated with SIBO. This conclusion should be regarded in light of the considerable time-kill effect at concentrations lower than those achieved in the bowel lumen after administration of conventional doses in humans.
TI  - Detection, partial purification and characterization of bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus brevis FPTLB3 isolated from freshwater fish: Bacteriocin from Lb. brevis FPTLB3.
AB  - Lactobacillus brevis FPTLB3 was isolated from freshwater fish, capable of producing bacteriocin that had broad spectrum of inhibition (3200 AU/ml) against Escherichia coli MTCC 1563, Enterococcus faecalis MTCC 2729, Lactobacillus casei MTCC 1423, Lactobacillus sakei ATCC 15521 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923. The antimicrobial activity of crude supernatant fluid was stable after heating at 121 degrees C for 60 min and declined thereafter. Stability of antimicrobial activity was observed at pH range of 2.0 to 8.0. Its active principle was proteinaceous in nature since the bacteriocin was inactivated by proteolytic enzymes, but not by other non-proteolytic enzymes. Mitomycin C and UV light did not affect the activity of the bacteriocin, while chloroform extraction completely destroyed their activity. Exposure to surfactant resulted in an increase in titre, except Nonidet P-40, which led to total loss of activity. No bacteriocin adsorption was detected at pH 1 to 2, whereas 100% bacteriocin adsorption was found at pH 6.5. Based on Tricine SDS-PAGE the estimated molecular mass of bacteriocin was 54 kDa. No plasmid was found to present in the isolate.
TI  - Chitosan-cellulose composite for wound dressing material. Part 2. Antimicrobial activity, blood absorption ability, and biocompatibility.
AB  - Chitosan (CS), a polysaccharide derived from chitin, the second most abundant polysaccharide, is widely used in the medical world because of its natural and nontoxic properties and its innate ability for antibacterial and hemostasis effects. In this study, the novel composites containing CS and cellulose (CEL) (i.e., [CEL + CS]), which we have previously synthesized using a green and totally recyclable method, were investigated for their antimicrobial activity, absorption of anticoagulated whole blood, anti-inflammatory activity through the reduction of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), and the biocompatibility with human fibroblasts. The [CEL + CS] composites were found to inhibit the growth of both Gram positive and negative micro-organisms. For examples, the regenerated 100% lyophilized chitosan material was found to reduce growth of Escherichia coli (ATCC 8739 and vancomycin resistant Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 51299) by 78, 36, and 64%, respectively. The composites are nontoxic to fibroblasts; that is, fibroblasts, which are critical to the formation of connective tissue matrix were found to grow and proliferate in the presence of the composites. They effectively absorb blood, and at the same rate and volume as commercially available wound dressings. The composites, in both air-dried and lyophilized forms, significantly inhibit the production of TNF-alpha and IL-6 by stimulated macrophages. These results clearly indicate that the biodegradable, biocompatible and nontoxic [CEL + CS] composites, particularly those dried by lyophilizing, can be effectively used as a material in wound dressings.
TI  - Effect of bacterial cell-free supernatants on infectivity of norovirus surrogates.
AB  - Bacterial metabolic products were evaluated for inhibitory effects on viral propagation in cell culture. Cell-free supernatants (CFS) were prepared from growth of Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 19433, Pseudomonas fluorescens ATCC 13525, Escherichia coli 08, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Bacillus subtilis 168, Bacillus coagulans 185A, B. coagulans 7050, Clostridium sporogenes PA3679, and a commercial probiotic mixture of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Lactobacillus salivarius, and Streptococcus thermophilus in microbiological medium or milk. The inhibitory effects of CFS on the propagation of murine norovirus 1 and Tulane virus in RAW 264.7 and LLCMK2 cells, respectively, were evaluated in the continuous presence of CFS or after exposure of host cells to CFS. Slight inhibition of viral propagation was observed for murine norovirus and Tulane virus in the continuous presence of CFS of B. subtilis 168 and E. faecalis 19433, respectively. CFS cytotoxicity was also determined by microscopic examination. Virus persisted in the CFS that demonstrated cytotoxic effects, suggesting a lack of direct effect of CFS on virions. The viral propagation indicates a general lack of competitive inhibition by bacterial extracellular products and bears significance in understanding the persistence of virus in food and human systems shared by bacteria that are recognized for their colonization and competitive capabilities.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of traditional medicinal plants from Ankober District, North Shewa Zone, Amhara Region, Ethiopia.
AB  - CONTEXT: Traditional medicinal plants have long been used in Ethiopia to treat human and livestock ailments. Despite a well-documented rich tradition of medicinal plant use in the country, their direct antimicrobial effects are still poorly known. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the antimicrobial activity of 19 medicinal plant species that were selected based on the ethnobotanical information on their traditional use to treat infectious diseases in Ankober District. METHODS: About 23 different ethanol extracts of plants obtained by maceration of various parts of 19 medicinal plant species were studied for potential antimicrobial activity using a broth microdilution method against Bacillus cereus, Bacteroides fragilis, Candida albicans, Clostridium perfringens, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enteritidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus pyogenes. RESULTS: Plant extracts from Embelia schimperi Vatke (Myrsinaceae) showed the strongest antibacterial activity with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) value of 64 microg/ml against B. cereus, L. monocytogenes, and S. pyogenes. Growth inhibitory activities were also observed for extracts of Ocimum lamiifolium Hochst. (Lamiaceae) against S. pyogenes, and those of Rubus steudneri Schweinf. (Rosaceae) against S. epidermidis at an MIC value of 128 microg/ml. Generally, 74% of ethanol extracts (17 extracts) showed antimicrobial activity against one or more of the microbial strains tested at an MIC value of 512 microg/ml or below. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Results confirm the antimicrobial role of traditional medicinal plants of Ankober and warrant further investigations on promising medicinal plant species so as to isolate and characterise chemicals responsible for the observed strong antimicrobial activities.
TI  - Phenolic content, antibacterial and antioxidant activities of Erica herbacea L.
AB  - Antibacterial and antioxidant activity, total phenolic and flavonoid concentrations of aqueous, ethanol and ethyl acetate extracts from the leaves and flowers of Erica herbacea L. were studied. In vitro antibacterial activity of the extracts was determined by macrodilution method. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) have been determined. Testing was performed on 30 clinical isolates, including different strains of Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis and Proteus vulgaris. The values for MIC were in the range from 2.5 mg/mL to 40 mg/mL. The most sensitive bacterial strains were Proteus vulgaris strains. The aqueous extract from E. herbacea was found the most active. The total phenolic content was determined using Folin-Ciocalteu reagent and ranged between 14.98 and 119.88 mg GA/g. The concentration of flavonoids in extracts was determined using spectrophotometric method with aluminium chloride and obtained results varied from 16.19 to 26.90 mg RU/g. Antioxidant activity was monitored spectrophotometrically using DPPH reagent. The highest capacity to neutralize DPPH radicals was found in the aqueous extract from E. herbacea. The results of the total phenolic content determination of the examined extracts indicate that E. herbacea extracts are a rich source of phenolic compounds and also possess a significant antioxidant activity and moderate antibacterial activity.
TI  - ArdA proteins from different mobile genetic elements can bind to the EcoKI Type I DNA methyltransferase of E. coli K12.
AB  - Anti-restriction and anti-modification (anti-RM) is the ability to prevent cleavage by DNA restriction-modification (RM) systems of foreign DNA entering a new bacterial host. The evolutionary consequence of anti-RM is the enhanced dissemination of mobile genetic elements. Homologues of ArdA anti-RM proteins are encoded by genes present in many mobile genetic elements such as conjugative plasmids and transposons within bacterial genomes. The ArdA proteins cause anti-RM by mimicking the DNA structure bound by Type I RM enzymes. We have investigated ArdA proteins from the genomes of Enterococcus faecalis V583, Staphylococcus aureus Mu50 and Bacteroides fragilis NCTC 9343, and compared them to the ArdA protein expressed by the conjugative transposon Tn916. We find that despite having very different structural stability and secondary structure content, they can all bind to the EcoKI methyltransferase, a core component of the EcoKI Type I RM system. This finding indicates that the less structured ArdA proteins become fully folded upon binding. The ability of ArdA from diverse mobile elements to inhibit Type I RM systems from other bacteria suggests that they are an advantage for transfer not only between closely-related bacteria but also between more distantly related bacterial species.
TI  - Enterococcus faecalis subverts and invades the host urothelium in patients with chronic urinary tract infection.
AB  - Bacterial urinary tract infections (UTI) are a major growing concern worldwide. Uropathogenic Escherichia coli has been shown to invade the urothelium during acute UTI in mice and humans, forming intracellular reservoirs that can evade antibiotics and the immune response, allowing recurrence at a later date. Other bacterial species, such as Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Klebsiella pneumonia and Salmonella enterica have also been shown to be invasive in acute UTI. However, the role of intracellular infection in chronic UTI causing more subtle lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), a particular problem in the elderly population, is poorly understood. Moreover, the species of bacteria involved remains largely unknown. A previous study of a large cohort of non-acute LUTS patients found that Enterococcus faecalis was frequently found in urine specimens. E. faecalis accounts for a significant proportion of chronic bladder infections worldwide, although the invasive lifestyle of this uropathogen has yet to be reported. Here, we wanted to explore this question in more detail. We harvested urothelial cells shed in response to inflammation and, using advanced imaging techniques, inspected them for signs of bacterial pathology and invasion. We found strong evidence of intracellular E. faecalis harboured within urothelial cells shed from the bladder of LUTS patients. Furthermore, using a culture model system, these patient-isolated strains of E. faecalis were able to invade a transitional carcinoma cell line. In contrast, we found no evidence of cellular invasion by E. coli in the patient cells or the culture model system. Our data show that E. faecalis is highly competent to invade in this context; therefore, these results have implications for both the diagnosis and treatment of chronic LUTS. worldwide. Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) are strains of Enterococcus faecium or Enterococcus faecalis that contain genes conferring resistance to vancomycin. Escherichia coli (E. coli), Klebsiella pneumonia (K. pneumonia), and other gram-negative bacteria may produce the enzymes known as extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL). These have the ability to inactivate beta lactam antibiotics such as penicillin, ampicillin, and the cephalosporins. The presence and growth (colonization) of VRE and ESBL-producing micro-organisms in the gastrointestinal tract is usually of no consequence for the host, but under certain circumstances, such as immunosuppression, gastrointestinal surgery, or physical debilitation, they may serve as a source of infection for the carrier. These hosts may also serve as a reservoir for the transmission of VRE and ESBL-producing organisms to other persons. Results from the Canadian Nosocomial Infection Surveillance Program showed that from 1999 to 2005, the rate of VRE colonization and VRE infection increased from 0.37 to 1.32 cases, and from 0.02 to 0.05 cases respectively per 1,000 patients admitted to hospital. The laboratory-based Canadian Ward Surveillance Study in 2008 found that ESBL-producing E. coli were identified in all Canadian geographic regions, and that 4.9% of E. coli isolates were ESBL producers. Specific prevention and control measures for antibiotic-resistant organisms (AROs) include screening (a process to identify persons colonized with AROs) and isolation of the carriers. Hospital infection prevention and control strategies have been developed in some Canadian jurisdictions, and these are compatible with other national and international documents. Non-specific strategies for controlling ARO transmission and infection include hand hygiene; environmental cleaning; antimicrobial stewardship; and bundled practices, such as those to prevent central line-associated blood stream infections. Antibiotic-resistant organisms, such as VRE and ESBL-producers, lead to the increased use of hospital resources due to extended hospital stays, laboratory tests, physician consultations, costly medications if therapy for a VRE or ESBL-related infection were to arise, and the need to adhere to infection prevention and control measures to prevent the further spread of these pathogens. Some of the increased resource usage results from the morbidity caused by VRE or ESBL-producing organism infections, while some is a consequence of control strategies. For example, it may be harder to transfer a patient to a rehabilitation facility if they are currently in isolation, which will in and of itself, prolong the length of stay. The objective of this systematic review is to evaluate the clinical evidence for the effectiveness of screening, isolation, and decolonization strategies for persons colonized or infected with VRE and ESBL-producing organisms in acute and long-term care facilities. The health services impact of these strategies will be discussed.
AB  - Bacterial resistance to antibiotics is an increasing problem in Canada and
TI  - [Bacteriological spectrum and drug susceptibility of pus from severe intra-abdominal infected patients with abdominal trauma].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To retrospectively analyze the bacteriological spectrum and drug susceptibility of pus flora from abdominal traumatic patients with severe intra-abdominal infection. METHODS: A total of 41 severe intra-abdominal infected patients with abdominal trauma were recruited to collect 123 abdominal pus specimens. And the results of laboratory microbiology and drug sensitivity were analyzed with the WHONET 5.4 software. RESULTS: A total of 297 strains of bacteria were isolated at (7.2 +/- 2.3) strains for each patient. Gram-positive bacteria accounted for 44.1% (131/297) , Gram-negative bacteria 55.2% (164/297) and fungi 0.7% (2/297). The top five isolates were Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumonia, Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Those antibiotics highly sensitive (>90%) to Escherichia coli included cefoperazone (91%), imipenem (98%); highly sensitive to Gram-positive cocci included teicoplanin (100%) and linezolid (100%). Staphylococcus aureus was 100% sensitive to vancomycin. The agents with a high susceptibility to Klebsiella pneumonia included imipenem (100%) and amikacin (79%). Ciprofloxacin (90%) had the highest sensitivity to Pseudomonas aeruginosa. CONCLUSIONS: The predominant bacteria of causing severe intra-abdominal infection of traumatic patients is Gram-negative bacteria, but the infection of Gram-positive bacteria, especially the ratio of Staphylococcus aureus infection is also comparatively high. Cefoperazone, ciprofloxacin, imipenem, vancomycin, teicoplanin and linezolid have higher antibacterial activity.
TI  - TMEDA-derived biscationic amphiphiles: An economical preparation of potent antibacterial agents.
AB  - Bis-alkylated derivatives of N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylenediamine (TMEDA) represent a well-known class of versatile biscationic amphiphiles, owing to their low cost and ease of preparation. Asymmetric TMEDA derivatives, however, have been studied significantly less, particularly in regards to their antimicrobial properties. We have thus prepared a series of 36 mono- and bis-alkylated TMEDA derivatives to evaluate their inhibition of bacterial growth. This series of compounds showed low micromolar activity against a panel of four bacteria. Optimal inhibition was observed when the biscationic amphiphiles possessed modest asymmetry and were composed of between 20 and 24 total carbon atoms in the side chains. These amphiphiles were prepared in a simple two-step procedure, utilizing inexpensive materials and atom-economical reactions, making them practical for further development.
TI  - Characteristics of urinary tract infection pathogens and their in vitro susceptibility to antimicrobial agents in China: data from a multicenter study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study assessed the characteristics of pathogens identified in clinical isolates from patients with urinary tract infection (UTI) and their in vitro sensitivity to commonly used antibiotics in the clinical setting in China. DESIGN AND SETTING: Multicenter study was conducted between January and December 2011 in 12 hospitals in China. PARTICIPANTS: Urine samples were collected from 356 symptomatic patients treated in the study hospitals for acute uncomplicated cystitis, recurrent UTI or complicated UTI. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were measured using broth microdilution according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute 2011 guidelines. Thirteen antimicrobial agents were tested: fosfomycin tromethamine, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, cefdinir, cefixime, cefaclor, cefprozil, cefuroxime, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, cefotaxime, azithromycin, nitrofurantoin and oxacillin. Escherichia coli isolates were screened and extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) production was confirmed by a double-disk synergy test. RESULTS: 198 urine samples were culture-positive and 175 isolates were included in the final analysis. E coli was detected in 50% of cultures, followed by Staphylococcus epidermidis (9%), Enterococcus faecalis (9%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (5%). The detection rate of ESBL-producing E coli was 53%. Resistance to levofloxacin was the most common among all the isolates. Nitrofurantoin and fosfomycin tromethamine had the greatest activity against E coli; overall, 92% and 91% of isolates were susceptible to these antimicrobials. E faecalis had the highest susceptibility rates to fosfomycin tromethamine (100%). CONCLUSIONS: The most frequently identified pathogens in our patients were ESBL-producing E coli and E faecalis. Fosfomycin tromethamine and nitrofurantoin showed a good antimicrobial activity against UTI pathogens. They may represent good options for the empiric treatment of patients with UTI.
TI  - [The frequency of bacteria in human gallstones].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Complications caused by lost gallstones within the abdominal cavity are well known. Abscesses, perforation of the gastro-intestinal tract were all described in the literature, but gallstones were found in hernial sac, or even in sputum after it penetrated through the diaphragm into the respiratory tract. These complications can develop between several weeks to several years postoperatively. Most complications can be treated surgically only. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty gallstones and bile samples were collected from 50 patients who underwent cholecystectomy (36 female / 14 male, avarge age: 60.8 +/- 6.8 years). All samples were sent for microbiological examination. RESULTS: bacterial colonization of the gallstone and the bile were found in 16 cases. Four of them showed acute inflammation in the gallbladder while pathological signs of chronic inflammation in the gallbladder wall were detected in eight cases. Empyema was found in four cases. Bacteria from enteral origin (Esherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterobacter cloacae) was detected in 13 cases, while non-enteral (Klebsiella penumoniae, Streptococcus alfa-haemoliticus) colony were detected in three cases. Positive bacterial cultures were identified in twelve female and fourmale patients. CONCLUSIONS: Different types of bacteria can be found in the gallstones, which may cause various complications.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of the roots, stems and leaves of Alchornea floribunda.
AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Alchornea floribunda Mull. Arg. is used in traditional medicine across Africa for the treatment of bacterial, fungal, parasitic and inflammatory disorders. AIM OF THE STUDY: To evaluate the antibacterial activity of the crude extracts of different plant parts in order to provide a scientific rationale for the proposed broad efficacy of Alchornea floribunda in the treatment of bacterial infections. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Extracts of roots, stems and leaves were prepared using solvents of various polarities in order to extract a wide range of phytochemicals. The antibacterial activity of these crude extracts was evaluated by micro-dilution assay, against Gram-positive (i.e. Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus saprophyticus) as well as Gram-negative (i.e. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Proteus mirabilis) bacteria. RESULTS: Generally, the ethanol (EtOH), methanol (MeOH), ethyl acetate (EtOAc) and chloroform (CHCl3) extracts demonstrated the best activities, with the leaves exhibiting the highest average activity for six of the eight pathogens. Of these, the ethanolic leaf extract was the most active against Staphylococcus aureus with an MIC value of 50microg/mL. Some other notable activity was observed for the ethyl acetate and chloroform root extracts against Staphylococcus aureus (50microg/mL), and for selected stem extracts against Staphylococcus aureus (50microg/mL), Klebsiella pneumoniae (63microg/mL) and Staphylococcus saprophyticus (63microg/mL). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the promising antibacterial activity of Alchornea floribunda against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria responsible for gastrointestinal, skin, respiratory and urinary ailments, and validates its use in the ethnopharmacology of the region.
TI  - In vitro regulation of CCL3 and CXCL12 by bacterial by-products is dependent on site of origin of human oral fibroblasts.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Production of chemokines by tissue resident cells is one of the main mechanisms involved in the inflammatory infiltrate formation during inflammation. The specific ability of fibroblasts from different oral tissues such as gingiva, periodontal ligament, and dental pulp from permanent and deciduous teeth in producing the chemokines CCL3 and CXCL12 under stimulation by bacterial products commonly found in endodontic infections was investigated. METHODS: Cultures of fibroblasts from gingiva and periodontal ligament as well as from dental pulp from permanent and deciduous teeth were established by using an explant technique and stimulated with increasing concentrations of Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (EcLPS) and Enterococcus faecalis lipoteichoic acid (EfLTA) for 1, 6, and 24 hours. Supernatants were tested for CCL3 and CXCL12 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: In general, CCL3 production was induced by EcLPS in the 4 fibroblast subtypes and by EfLTA in fibroblasts from gingiva and periodontal ligament. Constitutive CXCL12 synthesis decreased in all fibroblast subtypes especially under stimulation with EcLPS. Fibroblast from permanent deciduous teeth was the cell type presenting the most expressive reduction in CXCL12 release by both stimuli. On the basis of computational matching of CXCL12 mRNA with the microRNAs miR-141 and miR-200a, their expression was also investigated. Although detected in the fibroblasts, these molecules remained unaltered by bacterial by-product stimulation. CONCLUSIONS: EcLPS and EfLTA induced the production of CCL3 and unbalanced the synthesis of CXCL12 in a manner dependent on the specific tissue origin of fibroblasts.
TI  - Prolonged delivery of ciprofloxacin and diclofenac sodium from a polymeric fibre  device for the treatment of periodontal disease.
AB  - In vitro analysis of drug release and antimicrobial activity of the coblended crosslinked polymeric fibre device (PFD) were investigated. The fibre loaded with ciprofloxacin and diclofenac sodium was comprised of alginate and glycerol crosslinked with barium cations. The pH dependent drug release was evident with ciprofloxacin and diclofenac sodium diffusing from the fibre at pH 4.0 compared to pH 6.8, where the fibre swelled and eroded resulting in zero-order drug release. Agar diffusion studies followed by minimum inhibitory assays were conducted to determine the antimicrobial activity of the device against Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus mutans. The antimicrobial activity of the PFD was confirmed in both test assays against all test pathogens. The MIC ranges at pH 4.0 for E. coli, E. faecalis, and S. mutans were 0.5-0.8, 0.4-1.1, and 0.7-2.1 mug/mL, respectively. At pH 6.8, similar efficacies (0.3-0.5 mug/mL for E. coli and E. faecalis and 0.6-1.0 mug/mL for S. mutans) were observed. The effect of varying the plasticizer and crosslinking ion concentration on drug release profile of the fibers was further elucidated and conceptualized using molecular mechanics energy relationships (MMER) and by exploring the spatial disposition of geometrically minimized molecular conformations.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of resin rich plant extracts.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The in vitro antibacterial activity of resin rich methanolic extracts (RRMEs) of Commiphora myrrha, Operculina turpethum, and Pinus roxburghii. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Different concentration were studied by agar-well diffusion method against Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, Enterococcus faecalis) and Gram-negative bacterial strains (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Shigella dysenteriae). RESULTS: Among all the bacterial strains tested, E. faecalis was most sensitive and S. typhi was resistant to C. myrrha and P. roxburghii. The extracts of O. turpethum were active against all tested strains in which B. subtilis and S. aureus were the most sensitive. CONCLUSION: This suggested that the antibacterial activity of RRMEs of O. turpethum was more than C. myrrha and P. roxburghii. This probably explains the potential of these plants against a number of infections caused by bacterial strains tested.
TI  - [Comparative evaluation of antimicrobial activity of root canal irrigation agents].
AB  - A comparative study of the antimicrobial activity of different antiseptics for root canal irrigation: chlorhexidine bigluconate solution in 6 concentrations (2.0-1.0-0.5-0.2-0.1-0.02%), two sodium hypochlorite formulations: "Parcan" (France) and "Hypochloran-3" (Russia), and stabilized EDTA solution (EDTA Solutions (Korea)) was carried out. The results indicate that the level of antimicrobial activity of chlorhexidine is directly proportional to its concentration. Sodium hypochlorite tends to be more effective in compare with chlorhexidine. EDTA Solutions has a pronounced antimicrobial activity against all strains.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of the risk of inducing bacterial resistance to disinfection  treatment with photolysis of hydrogen peroxide.
AB  - The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the risk of inducing bacterial resistance to disinfection treatment with photolysis of H2O2 and comparing this with existing antibacterial agents. We tested seven antibacterial agents, including amoxicillin, cefepime hydrochloride, erythromycin, ofloxacin, clindamycin hydrochloride, ciprofloxacin hydrochloride, and minocycline hydrochloride, as positive controls for validation of the assay protocol. For all of the agents tested, at least one of the four bacterial species (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, and Streptococcus salivarius) was resistant to these agents by repeated exposure to subinhibitory concentrations of the agents up to 10 times. In contrast, antibacterial activity against any of the bacterial species tested (S. aureus, E. faecalis, E. coli, S. salivarius, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus mutans, and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans) was not affected by repeated exposure to the disinfection treatment up to 40 times. This finding suggested that the risk of inducing bacterial resistance by disinfection treatment was low. The active ingredient of this disinfection treatment is hydroxyl radicals generated by photolysis of H2O2. Therefore, hydroxyl radicals interact with several cell structures and different metabolic pathways in microbial cells, probably resulting in a lack of development of bacterial resistance. In conclusion, disinfection treatment with photolysis of H2O2 appears to be a potential alternative for existing antimicrobial agents in terms of a low risk of inducing bacterial resistance.
TI  - Neutralization of the antimicrobial effect of glyphosate by humic acid in vitro.
AB  - In the present study, the neutralization ability of the antimicrobial effect of glyphosate by different humic acids was investigated. The minimal inhibitory concentrations of glyphosate for different bacteria such as Bacillus badius, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Escherichia coli, E. coli 1917 strain Nissle, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Salmonella enteritidis and Salmonella typhimurium were determined in the presence or absence of different concentrations of humic acid (0.25, 0.5 and 1.0 mg mL(-1)). Our findings indicated that humic acids inhibited the antimicrobial effect of glyphosate on different bacteria. This information can help overcome the negative impact of glyphosate residues in feed and water.
TI  - Comparison of bacteria isolated from emergency department patients versus hospitalized patients.
AB  - PURPOSE: The frequencies and corresponding susceptibilities of bacteria isolated  from patients in the emergency department (ED) were compared with those from hospitalized patients. METHODS: A microbiology laboratory report of all positive bacterial cultures obtained in the ED, regardless of the source (e.g., blood, urine, sputum), was obtained. In the case of duplicate cultures, only the first isolate cultured from a single patient was included. Colonization-site cultures (e.g., nasal swabs) and culture reports identified by the laboratory as contaminant organisms were excluded from the evaluation. Antimicrobial susceptibility results were then compiled into a standardized ED-specific antibiogram. Antimicrobial susceptibilities for each pathogen in the ED antibiogram were compared with those in the hospitalwide antibiogram. If there was a difference of >/=5% between the susceptibility of a single antimicrobial agent, chi-square tests were conducted, and unadjusted odds ratios were calculated. Pathogens with fewer than 30 isolates were excluded from the susceptibility comparison. RESULTS: A total of 3140 cultures were evaluated (1417 from the ED, 1723 from the hospital). The frequencies of pathogens isolated in the ED and hospitalwide were similar, with the exception of Escherichia coli, which were more commonly isolated in ED patients, and Enterococcus species and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which were more common in hospitalized patients. Significant differences in susceptibility profiles were identified for Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, Enterococcus faecalis, E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and P. aeruginosa. CONCLUSION: Significant differences in the frequencies of bacteria isolated and corresponding susceptibilities were found in cultures obtained in ED patients compared with those obtained in hospitalized patients.
TI  - Boosted rat natural xenoantibodies cross-react with Enterococcus faecalis by targeting melibiose and L-rhamnose.
AB  - Natural antibodies include a subset described as xenoantibodies considered to be  directed at microorganisms and also cross-react with antigens of unrelated species. In this study, we generated T-cell-independent (TI) and T-cell-dependent (TD) xenoantibodies in Lewis rats with hamster and pig blood injections. TI anti-hamster and anti-pig IgM and IgG xenoantibodies cross-reacted with Enterococcus faecalis but not with Escherichia coli isolated from the blood of Lewis rats after cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). TI anti-pig IgM xenoantibodies also showed some reactivity with two human blood isolates of E. faecalis. In contrast, TD xenoantibodies did not show any reactivity with rat or human bacteria. TI and TD anti-hamster and anti-pig IgM and IgG xenoantibodies showed cross-reactivity with lymphocytes and endothelial cells from species distinct to that used for immunization. Glycan array analysis and inhibition assays identified antibodies against melibiose and L-rhamnose as mediators of anti-hamster and anti-porcine xenoantibody cross-reactivity with E. faecalis. A rise in TI anti-hamster and anti-pig xenoantibodies was accompanied by decreased survival of Lewis rats in a low-severity sepsis model of CLP. Therefore, TI xenoantibodies in the rat include anti-carbohydrate antibodies reactive to bacteria of endogenous flora. Enhancement of these antibodies may result in more severe infectious diseases caused by these microorganisms.
TI  - PrgK, a multidomain peptidoglycan hydrolase, is essential for conjugative transfer of the pheromone-responsive plasmid pCF10.
AB  - Peptidoglycan (PG) hydrolases associated with bacterial type IV secretion systems (T4SSs) are thought to generate localized lesions in the PG layer to facilitate assembly of the translocation channel. The pheromone-responsive plasmid pCF10 of Enterococcus faecalis encodes a putative cell wall hydrolase, PrgK, and here we report that a prgK deletion abolished functionality of the pCF10-encoded T4SS as monitored by pCF10 conjugative transfer. Expression in trans of wild-type prgK fully complemented this mutation. PrgK has three potential hydrolase motifs resembling staphylococcal LytM, soluble lytic transglycosylase (SLT), and cysteine-, histidine-dependent amidohydrolase/peptidase (CHAP) domains. Complementation analyses with mutant alleles established that PrgK bearing two hydrolase domains in any combination supported near-wild-type plasmid transfer, and PrgK bearing a single hydrolase domain supported at least a low level of transfer in filter matings. When exported to the Escherichia coli periplasm, each domain disrupted cell growth, and combinations of domains additionally induced cell rounding and blebbing and conferred enhanced sensitivity to osmotic shock. Each domain bound PG in vitro, but only the SLT domain exhibited detectable hydrolase activity, as shown by zymographic analyses and release of fluorescent PG fragments. Genes encoding three T4SS-associated, putative hydrolases, Lactococcus lactis CsiA, Tn925 Orf14, and pIP501 TraG, partially complemented the DeltaprgK mutation. Our findings establish that PrgK is an essential component of the pCF10-encoded Prg/Pcf T4SS and that its hydrolase domains coordinate their activities for full PrgK function. PrgK is indispensable for plasmid transfer in liquid matings, suggestive of a role in formation or stabilization of mating junctions.
TI  - [Pathogens of prostatitis and their drug resistance: an epidemiological survey].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the epidemiological features of the pathogens responsible for prostatitis in the Changshu area, and offer some evidence for the clinical treatment of prostatitis. METHODS: This study included 2 306 cases of prostatitis that were all clinically confirmed and subjected to pathogenic examinations in 3 hospitals of Changshu area from 2008 to 2012. Neisseria gonorrhoeae, mycoplasma urealyticum and chlamydia trachomatis were detected by nucleic acid amplification ABI 7500, the bacterial data analyzed by VITEK-2 Compact, the drug-resistance to antibacterial agents determined using the WHONET 5.6 software, and the enumeration data processed by chi-square test and curvilinear regression analysis using SPSS 19.0. RESULTS: The main pathogens responsible for prostatitis were found to be Staphylococcus haemolyticus (30%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (12%), Enterococcus faecalis (9%), Escherichia coli (6%), Staphylococcus warneri and Staphylococcus aureus (3%), Mycoplasma urealyticum (8%), chlamydia trachomatis (5%) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (6%). Statistically significant increases were observed in the detection rates of Escherichia coli (chi2 = 17.56, P<0.05), Mycoplasma urealyticum (chi2 = 8.73, P<0.05), Chlamydia trachomatis (chi2 = 8.73, P<0.05) and Enterococcus (chi2 = 8.22, P<0.05), but not in other pathogens. The resistance rates of Gram-positive bacteria to erythromycin and benzylpenicillin G were both above 45%, but with no significant difference between the two, those of Oxacillin (chi2 = 10.06, P<0.05) and Cefoxitin (chi2 = 9.89, P<0.05) were markedly increased, but those of quinolones, gentamycin and clindamycin remained low, except rifampicin (chi2 = 11.09, P<0.05). The resistance rates of Gram-negative bacteria to cefazolin and ampicillin were relatively high (mean 57.3%), and those to ceftriaxone (chi2 = 11.26, P<0.05) and trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole (chi2 =11.00, P< 0.05) significantly high; those to amikacin, cefepime, piperacillin/tazobactam and imipenem remained at low levels with no significant changes. However, the resistance rates of mycoplasma urealyticum to ciprofloxacin (chi2 = 11.18, P<0.05) and azithromycin (chi2 = 9.89, P<0.05) were remarkably increased. CONCLUSION: Gram-positive bacteria are the major pathogens responsible for prostatitis, but Escherichia coli, enterococcus and sexually transmitted disease pathogens are found to be involved in recent years. Quinolones and aminoglycosides are generally accepted as the main agents for the treatment of Gram-positive bacterial infection. However, rational medication for prostatitis should be based on the results of pathogen isolation and drug sensitivity tests in a specific area.
TI  - Epidemic Escherichia coli ST131 and Enterococcus faecium ST17 in coastal marine sediments from an Italian beach.
AB  - Fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) are used worldwide to assess water quality in coastal environments, but little is known about their genetic diversity and pathogenicity. This study examines the prevalence, antimicrobial resistance, virulence, and genetic diversity of FIB isolated from marine sediments from a central Adriatic seaside resort. FIB, recovered from 6 out of 7 sites, were significantly more abundant at sampling stations 300 m offshore than close to the shore. Escherichia coli accounted for 34.5% of fecal coliforms, and Enterococcus faecalis accounted for 32% of enterococci. Most isolates (27% of E. coli and 22% of enterococci) were recovered from the sediments that had the highest organic content. Multidrug-resistant E. coli (31%) and enterococci (22%) were found at nearly all sites, whereas 34.5% of E. coli and 28% of enterococci harboring multiple virulence factors were recovered from just two sites. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis typing showed wide genetic diversity among isolates. Human epidemic clones ( E. coli ST131 and Enterococcus faecium ST17) were identified for the first time by multilocus sequence typing in an area where bathing had not been prohibited. These clones were from sites far removed from riverine inputs, suggesting a wide diffusion of pathogenic FIB in the coastal environment and a high public health risk.
TI  - Prevalence of the aminoglycoside phosphotransferase genes aph(3')-IIIa and aph(3')-IIa in Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica and Staphylococcus aureus isolates in Austria.
AB  - The aminoglycoside phosphotransferase aph(3')-IIa primarily inactivates kanamycin and neomycin, whilst aph(3')-IIIa also inactivates amikacin. The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of both resistance genes in major human pathogens to obtain their baseline prevalence in the gene pool of these bacterial populations in Austria. In total, 10 541 Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica and Staphylococcus aureus isolates were collected representatively without selection bias between 2008 and 2011. Isolates were analysed by aph(3')-IIIa/nptIII- and aph(3')-IIa/nptII-specific TaqMan real-time PCR. For positive strains, MICs using Etests were performed and resistance gene sequences were determined. The overall prevalence of aph(3')-IIIa/nptIII was 1.62 % (95 % confidence interval: 1.38-1.88 %). In Escherichia coli, enterococci, Staphylococcus aureus, P. aeruginosa and Salmonella spp., the aph(3')-IIIa/nptIII prevalence was 0.47 % (0-1.47 %), 37.53 % (32.84-42.40 %), 2.90 % (1.51-5.02 %), 0 % (0-0.32 %) and 0 % (0-0.037 %), respectively. Eleven of a total of 169 carriers showed single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the resistance allele. The overall prevalence of aph(3')-IIa/nptII was 0.0096 % (0-0.046 %). Escherichia coli (0-0.70 %), enterococci (0-0.75 %), Staphylococcus aureus (0-0.73 %) and P. aeruginosa (0-0.32 %) did not carry aph(3')-IIa. A single Salmonella isolate was positive, resulting in an aph(3')-IIa prevalence of 0.013 % (0-0.058 %). aph(3')-IIIa/nptIII carriers were moderately prevalent in the strains tested except for in enterococci, which appeared to be an important reservoir for aph(3')-IIIa. aph(3')-IIa/nptII genes were detected at clinically irrelevant frequencies and played no significant role in the aminoglycoside resistance gene pool during the observation period.
TI  - Microbiological findings of vulvovaginitis in prepubertal girls.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare vaginal culture results between prepubertal girls with and  without vulvovaginitis, and obtain an overview of the most commonly encountered microbes. DESIGN: Prospective descriptive study. SETTING: Outpatient clinic of Vilnius University Hospital Santariskiu Klinikos during September 2011-December 2012. PATIENTS: 115 prepubertal girls with vulvovaginitis symptoms and additionally 20 age-matched asymptomatic girls. METHODS: Each girl had a vaginal smear carried out using a sterile swab from the introitus or lower third of the vagina. All samples were referred to the microbiology laboratory where standard microbiological diagnostic procedures were performed. RESULTS: Positive microbiological findings were seen in all 115 (100%) symptomatic girls and in 12 (60%) control group girls (p<0.001). Pathogenic bacteria were found only in symptomatic girls. Statistically significant differences in bacteria culture results (pure or mixed) and growth of isolated bacteria colonies between patients versus healthy girls were found (p<0.05). The dominant bacteria in the target group, accounting for 66% of all isolated microbes, were Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus coagulase negative, Streptococcus alpha haemolyticus and A group Streptococcus beta haemolyticus. The bacteria of faecal origin were isolated from 61 (53%) girls with vulvovaginitis and from 5 (25%) girls without vaginal inflammation (p<0.05). Instances of Candida species were extremely rare (2.6%). CONCLUSIONS: Positive microbiological findings, mixed bacteria cultures and a high growth of bacteria colonies are found significantly more often in girls with vulvovaginitis. The main causative premenarchal vulvovaginitis agents are faecal in origin.
TI  - Sunlight mediated inactivation mechanisms of Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli in clear water versus waste stabilization pond water.
AB  - Escherichia coli and enterococci have been previously reported to differ in the mechanisms and conditions that affect their sunlight-mediated inactivation in waste stabilization ponds. This study was undertaken to further characterize these mechanisms, using simulated sunlight and single strains of laboratory-grown E. coli and Enterococcus faecalis, with a focus on characterizing the contribution of exogenous reactive oxygen species to the inactivation process. We found that direct damage by UVB light (280-320 nm) was not a significant inactivation mechanism for either organism. E. coli inactivation was strongly dependent on dissolved oxygen concentrations and the presence of UVB wavelengths but E. coli were not susceptible to inactivation by exogenous sensitizers present in waste stabilization pond water. In contrast, E. faecalis inactivation in pond water occurred primarily through exogenous mechanisms, with strong evidence that singlet oxygen is an important transient reactive species. The exogenous mechanism could utilize wavelengths into the visible spectrum and sensitizers were mainly colloidal, distributed between 0.2 and approximately 1 mum in size. Singlet oxygen is likely an important endogenous species in both E. faecalis and E. coli inactivation due to sunlight. Although the two organisms had similar inactivation rates in buffered, clear water, the inactivation rate of E. faecalis was 7 times greater than that of E. coli in air-saturated pond water at circumneutral pH due to its susceptibility to exogenous sensitizers and longer wavelengths.
TI  - Rapid whole-genome sequencing for detection and characterization of microorganisms directly from clinical samples.
AB  - Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) is becoming available as a routine tool for clinical microbiology. If applied directly on clinical samples, this could further reduce diagnostic times and thereby improve control and treatment. A major bottleneck is the availability of fast and reliable bioinformatic tools. This study was conducted to evaluate the applicability of WGS directly on clinical samples and to develop easy-to-use bioinformatic tools for the analysis of sequencing data. Thirty-five random urine samples from patients with suspected urinary tract infections were examined using conventional microbiology, WGS of isolated bacteria, and direct sequencing on pellets from the urine samples. A rapid method for analyzing the sequence data was developed. Bacteria were cultivated from 19 samples but in pure cultures from only 17 samples. WGS improved the identification of the cultivated bacteria, and almost complete agreement was observed between phenotypic and predicted antimicrobial susceptibilities. Complete agreement was observed between species identification, multilocus sequence typing, and phylogenetic relationships for Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis isolates when the results of WGS of cultured isolates and urine samples were directly compared. Sequencing directly from the urine enabled bacterial identification in polymicrobial samples. Additional putative pathogenic strains were observed in some culture-negative samples. WGS directly on clinical samples can provide clinically relevant information and drastically reduce diagnostic times. This may prove very useful, but the need for data analysis is still a hurdle to clinical implementation. To overcome this problem, a publicly available bioinformatic tool was developed in this study.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity and cytotoxicity of the ethanol extract, fractions and eight compounds isolated from Eriosema robustum (Fabaceae).
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity and  the cytotoxicity of the ethanol crude extract, fractions and isolated compounds from the twigs of Eriosema robustum, a plant used for the treatment of coughs and skin diseases. METHODS: Column chromatographic and spectroscopic techniques were used to isolate and identify eight compounds, robusflavones A (1) and B (2), orostachyscerebroside A (3), stigmasterol (4), 1-O-heptatriacontanoyl glycerol (5), eicosanoic acid (6), 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside of sitosterol (7) and 6-prenylpinocembrin (8), from E. robustum. A two-fold serial microdilution method was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against fungi and bacteria, and the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazolyl-2)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide reduction assay was used to evaluate the cytotoxicity. RESULTS: Fraction B had significant antimicrobial activity against Aspergillus fumigatus and Cryptoccocus neoformans (MIC 0.08 mg/ml), whilst the crude extract and fraction A had moderate activity against A. fumigatus and Candida albicans (MIC 0.16 mg/ml). Fraction A however had excellent activity against Staphylococcus aureus (MIC 0.02 mg/ml), Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli (MIC 0.04 mg/ml). The crude extract had significant activity against S. aureus, E. faecalis and E. coli. Fraction B had good activity against E. faecalis and E. coli (MIC 0.08 mg/ml). All the isolated compounds had a relatively weak antimicrobial activity. An MIC of 65 mug/ml was obtained with robusflavones A (1) and B (2) against C. albicans and A. fumigatus, orostachyscerebroside A (3) against A. fumigatus, and robusflavone B (2) against C. neoformans. Compound 8 had the best activity against bacteria (average MIC 55 mug/ml). The 3 fractions and isolated compounds had LC50 values between 13.20 to > 100 mug/ml against Vero cells yielding selectivity indices between 0.01 and 1.58. CONCLUSION: The isolated compounds generally had a much lower activity than expected based on the activity of the fractions from which they were isolated. This may be the result of synergism between different compounds in the complex extracts or fractions. The results support the traditional use of E. robustum to treat infections. The crude extract had a good activity and low preparation cost, and may be useful in topical applications to combat microbial infections.
TI  - Bio-preservation of ground beef meat by Enterococcus faecalis CECT7121.
AB  - Meat and particularly ground beef is frequently associated with Food Poisoning episodes and breeches in Food Safety. The main goal of this research was to evaluate the bactericide effect of the probiotic Enterococcus faecalis CECT7121, against different pathogens as: Escherichia coli O157:H7, Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium perfringens and Listeria monocytogenes, inoculated in ground beef meat. Three studies were performed to evaluate the inhibition of E. faecalis CECT7121 on ground beef meat samples inoculated with pathogens: Study I: Samples (100 g meat) were inoculated with pathogens (10(3) CFU/g)) and E. faecalis CECT7121 (10(4) CFU/g) simultaneously. Study II: Samples were inoculated with E. faecalis CECT7121 24 h before the pathogens. Study III: E. faecalis CECT7121were inoculated 24 h after pathogens. The viable counts were performed at 0, 24, 48 and 72 h post-inoculation. The simultaneous inoculation of E. faecalis CECT7121 with E. coli O157:H7 strains resulted in the absence of viable counts of bacteria at 72 h post-treatment. However, when the probiotic was added 24 h before and 24 h after the pathogen E. coli O157:H7, viable cells were not detected at 24 h and 48 h post-treatment, respectively. Consistently, neither S. aureus nor Cl. perfringens viable bacteria were detected at 48 h in whole assays when inoculated with E. faecalis CECT7121. The same trend than described before was obtained after applying the 3 models assayed for L. monocytogenes. The current assays demonstrated the bactericide activity of E. faecalis CECT7121 strain on bacterial pathogens in ground beef meat.
TI  - Prevalence and antimicrobial resistance of canine urinary tract pathogens.
AB  - This study aims to describe the incidence and risk factors for positive urinary tract culture, the prevalence of urinary tract pathogens in single organism and mixed cultures and changes in their antimicrobial resistance over 10 years. A retrospective review of computer records detailing canine urine samples submitted between August 1999 and September 2009 for culture and sensitivity in a UK tertiary referral hospital is described. 17.5 per cent of 5923 samples (670 of 4530 dogs) were positive cultures. 85.3 per cent of cultures yielded a single isolate. The prevalence of bacterial species differed between mixed and single isolate cultures. Entire and neutered female dogs were more likely to return positive cultures than male dogs (OR=2.5 and 1.5, respectively). Escherichia coli was most commonly isolated (53.9 per cent) and affected female dogs, older dogs and neutered dogs more. There was an increase in the antimicrobial resistance of Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas Aeruginosa, and a decrease in the effectiveness of enrofloxacin, cephalexin and oxytetracycline. The prevalence of urinary bacterial isolates is described for a large group of dogs. Monitoring changes in antimicrobial efficacy and microbial resistance guides the empirical use of antimicrobials for the treatment of urinary tract infection and helps formulate strategic plans to limit drug resistance.
TI  - Size and composition of synthetic calcium sulfate beads influence dissolution and elution rates in vitro.
AB  - Treatments of osteomyelitis lag behind bacterial resistance to antibiotics. We tested different-sized calcium sulfate beads and their ability to elute multiple antibiotics in vitro as a possible method to improve the therapeutic delivery in patients. Two sizes of calcium sulfate beads (4.8 and 3.0 mm diameter) that contained vancomycin, tobramycin, or both were dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline, and the rate of dissolution by weight and antibiotic elution by the disc diffusion assay and high-pressure liquid chromatography were measured. The 4.8 mm beads showed significantly higher dissolution rates relative to the 3.0 mm beads (2.3 mg/day vs. 1.3 mg/day). While the vancomycin-loaded 4.8 mm beads eluted for a longer time relative to the 3.0 mm beads (20 days vs. 10 days), the smaller beads had threefold higher elution for the first 2 days, before dropping to near zero elution by day 4. The presence of tobramycin extended the elution of the vancomycin to day 40, which closely matches the recommended 6 weeks to treat orthopedic staphylococcus infections. These data suggest that size and content of the bead are variables that could affect their clinical success, and both could be exploited to tailor treatments of specific infections and injuries.
TI  - Photocatalytic antibacterial effects are maintained on resin-based TiO2 nanocomposites after cessation of UV irradiation.
AB  - Photocatalysis induced by TiO2 and UV light constitutes a decontamination and antibacterial strategy utilized in many applications including self-cleaning environmental surfaces, water and air treatment. The present work reveals that antibacterial effects induced by photocatalysis can be maintained even after the cessation of UV irradiation. We show that resin-based composites containing 20% TiO2 nanoparticles continue to provide a pronounced antibacterial effect against the pathogens Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus mutans and Enterococcus faecalis for up to two hours post UV. For biomaterials or implant coatings, where direct UV illumination is not feasible, a prolonged antibacterial effect after the cessation of the illumination would offer new unexplored treatment possibilities.
TI  - Isolation and biological activities of an endophytic Mortierella alpina strain from the Antarctic moss Schistidium antarctici.
AB  - The Antarctic endophytic fungus (strain ITA1-CCMA 952) was isolated from the moss Schistidium antarctici found in Admiralty Bay, King George Island, Antarctica. Strain ITA1-CCMA 952 was assigned to the specie Mortierella alpina by phylogenetic analysis based on 18S rRNA gene sequences. This strain produces high levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), including y-(gamma) linolenic acid and arachidonic acid, which when combined represents 48.3% of the total fatty acid content. Fungal extracts demonstrated strong antioxidant activity with the EC50 value of 48.7 mug mL(-1) and also a strong antibacterial activity, mainly against the following bacteria: Escherichia coli, with a MIC of 26.9 mug mL(-1) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus faecalis, both with a MIC of 107 mug mL(-1). A GC-MS analysis of the chloroform fraction obtained from the crude extract revealed the presence of potential antimicrobials (Pyrrolo[1,2-a]pyrazine-1,4-dione, hexahydro-3-(2-methylpropyl) and Pyrrolo[1,2-a]pyrazine-1,4-dione, hexahydro-3-(phenylmethyl)) as the major compounds. Therefore, the M. alpina strain ITA1-CCMA 952 is a promising fungus for the biotechnological production of antibiotics, antioxidant substances and PUFAs. This study highlights the need for more research in extreme environments, such as Antarctica.
TI  - Combined dielectrophoresis-Raman setup for the classification of pathogens recovered from the urinary tract.
AB  - Rapid and effective methods of pathogen identifications are of major interest in  clinical microbiological analysis to administer timely tailored antibiotic therapy. Raman spectroscopy as a label-free, culture-independent optical method is suitable to identify even single bacteria. However, the low bacteria concentration in body fluids makes it difficult to detect their characteristic molecular fingerprint directly in suspension. Therefore, in this study, Raman spectroscopy is combined with dielectrophoresis, which enables the direct translational manipulation of bacteria in suspensions with spatial nonuniform electrical fields so as to perform specific Raman spectroscopic characterization. A quadrupole electrode design is used to capture bacteria directly from fluids in well-defined microsized regions. With live/dead fluorescence viability staining, it is verified, that the bacteria survive this procedure for the relevant range of field strengths. The dielectrophoretic enrichment of bacteria allows for obtaining high quality Raman spectra in dilute suspensions with an integration time of only one second. As proof-of-principle study, the setup was tested with Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis, two bacterial strains that are commonly encountered in urinary tract infections. Furthermore, to verify the potential for dealing with real world samples, pathogens from patients' urine have been analyzed. With the additional help of multivariate statistical analysis, a robust classification model could be built and allowed the classification of those two strains within a few minutes. In contrast, the standard microbiological diagnostics are based on very time-consuming cultivation tests. This setup holds the potential to reduce the crucial parameter diagnosis time by orders of magnitude.
TI  - Polymerase chain reaction for Enterococcus faecalis in drain fluid: the first screening test for symptomatic colorectal anastomotic leakage. The Appeal-study: analysis of parameters predictive for evident anastomotic leakage.
AB  - PURPOSE: With current diagnostic methods, the majority of patients with symptomatic colorectal anastomotic leakage(CAL) is identified approximately 1 week after operation.The aim of this study is to determine whether real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for detection of Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis on drain fluid can serve as a screening test for CAL in the early postoperative phase. METHODS: All patients included in this multicenter prospective observational study underwent left-sided colorectal resection for both malignant and benign diseases with construction of an anastomosis. In all patients, an intra-abdominal drain was placed during operation. During the first five postoperative days, drain fluid was processed for RT-PCR. The quantitative results of the RT-PCR on days 2 to 5 were compared to the results of day 1 in order to detect concentration changes. RESULTS: In total, 243 patients, with both benign and malignant diseases, were included of whom 19 (7.8 %) developed symptomatic CAL. An increase in E. coli concentration was found insignificantly more patients with CAL on day 4 and 5 [p =0.0004; diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) 7.9]. For E. faecalis, this result was found for days 2, 3, and 4 (p <0.003) with highest DOR on day 3 (31.6). Sensitivity and negative predictive values were 92.9 and 98.7 %, respectively, virtually ruling out CAL in case of negative test results on the third postoperative day. CONCLUSION: Quantitative PCR for E. faecalis performed on drain fluid may be an objective, affordable and fast screening tool for symptomatic colorectal anastomotic leakage.
TI  - A new plant-derived antibacterial is an inhibitor of efflux pumps in Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - An in-depth evaluation was undertaken of a new antibacterial natural product (1)  recently isolated and characterised from the plant Hypericum olympicum L. cf. uniflorum. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined for a panel of bacteria, including: meticillin-resistant and -susceptible strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus; vancomycin-resistant and -susceptible Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium; penicillin-resistant and -susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae; group A streptococci (Streptococcus pyogenes); and Clostridium difficile. MICs were 2-8 mg/L for most staphylococci and all enterococci, but were >/=16 mg/L for S. haemolyticus and were >32 mg/L for all species in the presence of blood. Compound 1 was also tested against Gram-negative bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium but was inactive. The MIC for Mycobacterium bovis BCG was 60 mg/L, and compound 1 inhibited the ATP-dependent Mycobacterium tuberculosis MurE ligase [50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) = 75 muM]. In a radiometric accumulation assay with a strain of S. aureus overexpressing the NorA multidrug efflux pump, the presence of compound 1 increased accumulation of (14)C-enoxacin in a concentration-dependent manner, implying inhibition of efflux. Only moderate cytotoxicity was observed, with IC50 values of 12.5, 10.5 and 8.9 muM against human breast, lung and fibroblast cell lines, respectively, highlighting the potential value of this chemotype as a new antibacterial agent and efflux pump inhibitor.
TI  - Hydrolysates of glycated and heat-treated peanut 7S globulin (Ara h 1) modulate human gut microbial proliferation, survival and adhesion.
AB  - AIMS: Evaluation of an effect of glycation of Ara h 1 on proliferation and survival rate and adhesion of intestinal Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli and Lactobacillus acidophilus. METHODS AND RESULTS: Pure Ara h 1 heated at three different temperature conditions (G37, G60 and C145 degrees C) in the presence or absence of glucose was subjected to enzymatic hydrolysis. Impacts of Ara h 1 hydrolysates on the bacterial proliferation, survival rate and adhesion to Caco-2 cells in mono and heterogeneous cultures were studied with fluorescent techniques: DAPI, LIVE/DEAD staining and FISH. Examined hydrolysates hindered proliferation of E. coli and Ent. faecalis with simultaneous decrease in their survival. Maillard reaction (MR, glycation) of Ara h 1 did not alter the effect of hydrolysates on bacterial proliferation rate. Hydrolysates modified at 60 and 145 degrees C with glucose altered the profile of immobilized bacteria, mostly by lowering the number of adhering E. coli and promoting the adhesion of bacteria from genera Lactobacillus and Enterococcus. CONCLUSIONS: Ara h1 hydrolysates processed in various ways demonstrated their strong modulatory effect on bacterial proliferation, survival rate and adhesion. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Reducing the adhesion of opportunistic bacteria by hydrolysates of Ara h 1 glycated at 60 and 145 degrees C, together with modulation of immobilization of beneficial lactobacilli and enterococci, may be of relevance in terms of the physiological status of the intestinal barrier.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity and SAR study of new gemini imidazolium-based chlorides.
AB  - A series of 70 new 3,3'(alpha,omega-dioxaalkyl)bis(1-alkylimidazolium) chlorides  were synthesized. They were characterized with respect to surface active properties and antimicrobial activity against the following pathogens: Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida krusei, and Candida albicans. In this article, besides description of the synthesis, we characterize a set of features of these compounds, concerning their structure (described by the length of the dioxaalkan spacer and the length of the alkyl substituent in the aromatic ring) and surface active properties (critical micelle concentration, value of surface tension at critical micelle concentration, value of surface excess, molecular area of a single particle, and free energy of adsorption of molecule). Then, we present a SAR study for Staphylococcus aureus, as one of the most widespread pathogenic strains, conducted with the help of the Dominance-based Rough Set Approach (DRSA), that involves identification of relevant features and relevant combinations of features being in strong relationship with a high antimicrobial activity of the compounds. The SAR study shows, moreover, that the antimicrobial activity is dependent on the type of substituents and their position at the chloride moiety, as well as on the surface active properties of the compounds.
TI  - An endogenous ribonuclease inhibitor regulates the antimicrobial activity of ribonuclease 7 in the human urinary tract.
AB  - Recent studies stress the importance of antimicrobial peptides in protecting the  urinary tract from infection. Previously, we have shown that ribonuclease 7 (RNase 7) is a potent antimicrobial peptide that has a broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity against uropathogenic bacteria. The urothelium of the lower urinary tract and intercalated cells of the kidney produce RNase 7, but regulation of its antimicrobial activity has not been well defined. Here, we characterize the expression of an endogenous inhibitor, ribonuclease inhibitor (RI), in the urinary tract and evaluate its effect on the antimicrobial activity of RNase 7. Using RNA isolated from non-infected human bladder and kidney tissue, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction showed that RNH1, the gene encoding RI, is constitutively expressed throughout the urinary tract. With pyelonephritis, RNH1 expression and RI peptide production significantly decrease. Immunostaining localized RI production to the umbrella cells of the bladder and intercalated cells of the renal collecting tubule. In vitro assays showed that RI bound to RNase 7 and suppressed its antimicrobial activity by blocking its ability to bind the cell wall of uropathogenic bacteria. Thus, these results demonstrate a new immunomodulatory role for RI and identified a unique regulatory pathway that may affect how RNase 7 maintains urinary tract sterility.
TI  - Isolation and partial characterization of bacteria (Pseudoalteromonas sp.) with potential antibacterial activity from a marine costal environment from New Caledonia.
AB  - Marine bacteria are a rich source of bioactive metabolites. However, the microbial diversity of marine ecosystem still needs to be explored. The aim of this study was to isolate and characterize bacteria with antimicrobial activities from various marine coastal environment of New Caledonia. We obtained 493 marine isolates from various environments and samples of which 63 (12.8%) presented an antibacterial activity against a panel of reference pathogenic strains (Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis). Ten out of the most promising strains were cultured, fractionated and screened for antibacterial activity. Four of them (NC282, NC412, NC272 and NC120) showed at least an activity against reference and multidrug-resistant pathogenic strains and were found to belong to the genus Pseudoalteromonas, according to the 16S phylogenetic analysis. The NC282 strain does not belong to any described Pseudoalteromonas species and might be of interest for further chemical and biological characterization. These findings suggest that the identified strains may contribute to the discovery for new sources of antimicrobial substances to develop new therapies to treat infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: With the constant increasing of bacterial resistance against known antibiotics in worldwide public health, it is now necessary to find new sources of antimicrobials. Marine bacteria from New Caledonia were isolated, tested for antibacterial activity and characterized to find new active molecules against multidrug-resistant bacteria. This study illustrates the diversity of the marine ecosystem with potent new bacteria species. Also the potential of marine bacteria as a rich source of bioactive molecule, for example antibiotics, is highlighted.
TI  - Antibacterial effects of curcumin: an in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration study.
AB  - Aim: To evaluate the antibacterial effect of curcumin with the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) method in standard bacterial strains. METHODS: The in vitro antibacterial activity of curcumin was evaluated against methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) (ATCC 29213), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (ATCC 43300), Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29212), Bacillus subtilis (ATCC 6633), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853), Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (ATCC 700603) using the macrodilution broth susceptibility test method. After incubation in tubes, the antibacterial activity of curcumin was detected by a lack of turbidity, which indicated the inhibition of bacterial growth. The concentration in the tube with the highest dilution showing no turbidity was defined as the MIC. RESULTS: The curcumin MIC values were 175 microg/ml, 129 microg/ml, 219 microg/ml, 217 microg/ml, 163 microg/ml, 293 microg/ml and 216 microg/ml against P. aeruginosa, B. subtilis, MSSA, MRSA, E. coli, E. faecalis and K. Pneumonia, respectively. CONCLUSION: This study revealed antibacterial effects of curcumin against standard bacterial strains in high concentrations. Animal experiments have demonstrated that curcumin applied at high doses has strong antibacterial activity. There is a need for further in vivo studies to shed light on antibacterial effects of curcumin with high concentrations.
TI  - Solidago, orthosiphon, birch and cranberry extracts can decrease microbial colonization and biofilm development in indwelling urinary catheter: a microbiologic and ultrastructural pilot study.
AB  - PURPOSE: Plants extracts are used in urology to manage urinary tract infections.  We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of a preparation with solidago, orthosiphon, birch and cranberry extracts (CISTIMEV PLUS((R))) in reducing microbial colonization and biofilm development in patients with indwelling urinary catheters. METHODS: All consecutive outpatients attending our department between January and June 2010 for the substitution of indwelling catheters were considered for this single-blinded, randomized and controlled pilot study to test superiority of the preventative management (CISTIMEV PLUS((R)), 1 tablet daily for 30 days) in respect to no treatment. A sample size of 10-40 participants per group was considered adequate. All patients underwent urine culture the same day of the catheter substitution and were then randomized into test group (n = 48) and control group (n = 35). Ultrastructural analysis was also performed. After 30 days, the catheter was replaced and the analysis repeated. The primary outcome was the rate of positive urinary culture at the end of the entire study period. RESULTS: Ten patients abandoned the study. At 30 days, according to per-protocol analysis, the groups statistically differed regarding the rate of positive urine cultures: test group 10/43 and control group 16/30 (p = 0.013) (-30.1 % [95 % CI -51.94 to -8.21]). The most common isolated bacteria were Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis. CONCLUSIONS: The use of solidago, orthosiphon, birch and cranberry extracts resulted in a significant reduction of microbial colonization in patients with indwelling urinary catheters. Larger clinical trials are needed to demonstrate that the effects here reported are sufficient to reduce symptomatic catheter-associated urinary tract infections.
TI  - In vitro efficacy of various topical antimicrobial agents in different time periods from contamination to application against 6 multidrug-resistant bacterial strains isolated from burn patients.
AB  - AIM: In vitro efficacy evaluation of eleven topical antimicrobials against multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria isolated from burn wounds of our patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Growth of six MDR bacterial strains: Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2 strains), Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli in burn-wound models was evaluated 24-h after application of the tested agents. Four different wound models were created to investigate the role of time elapsed between inoculation of bacteria and application of the agents on their antimicrobial activity and efficacy. RESULTS: The efficacy against all the 6 bacteria in freshly contaminated wounds was excellent in majority of the tested agents. The longer was the time interval between inoculation and application of the topical antimicrobial agents, the higher failure of the agents was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Topical antimicrobials play an important role in treatment of burn wounds, but they should be used according to their efficacy against bacterial strains present in patients' wounds. In cases where topical agents have been applied after 24 h, when formation of mature biofilm in the wound could be expected, it would probably not be possible to kill all the bacteria using topical antimicrobial therapy only.
TI  - The two functional enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductases of Enterococcus faecalis do not mediate triclosan resistance.
AB  - Enoyl-acyl carrier protein (enoyl-ACP) reductase catalyzes the last step of the elongation cycle in the synthesis of bacterial fatty acids. The Enterococcus faecalis genome contains two genes annotated as enoyl-ACP reductases, a FabI-type enoyl-ACP reductase and a FabK-type enoyl-ACP reductase. We report that expression of either of the two proteins restores growth of an Escherichia coli fabI temperature-sensitive mutant strain under nonpermissive conditions. In vitro assays demonstrated that both proteins support fatty acid synthesis and are active with substrates of all fatty acid chain lengths. Although expression of E. faecalis fabK confers to E. coli high levels of resistance to the antimicrobial triclosan, deletion of fabK from the E. faecalis genome showed that FabK does not play a detectable role in the inherent triclosan resistance of E. faecalis. Indeed, FabK seems to play only a minor role in modulating fatty acid composition. Strains carrying a deletion of fabK grow normally without fatty acid supplementation, whereas fabI deletion mutants make only traces of fatty acids and are unsaturated fatty acid auxotrophs. IMPORTANCE: The finding that exogenous fatty acids support growth of E. faecalis strains defective in fatty acid synthesis indicates that inhibitors of fatty acid synthesis are ineffective in countering E. faecalis infections because host serum fatty acids support growth of the bacterium.
TI  - Protection of Enterococcus faecalis in mixed cultures with carbapenemase-producing Escherichia coli and Bacteroide fragilis: effect of the bacterial load.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: This study explores effects of pH and inoculum size on imipenem versus tigecycline activity against E. coli, B. fragilis and E. faecalis, both in individual and mixed cultures. METHODS: MIC/MBCs (mg/L) of tigecycline and imipenem were 0.12/>/= 16 and 4/4 for E. coli, 0.12/0.5 and >/= 16/>/= 16 for B. fragilis, and 0.12/>/= 16 and 2/>/= 16 for E. faecalis, respectively. Killing curves in supplemented Brucella broth were performed at pH 7 or 5.8, with two final inocula ( approximately 105 or approximately 107 cfu/ml) of each isolate (individual cultures) and with 1:1:1 mixed inocula. Tubes were 48 h incubated at 37 masculineC in anaerobiosis. Final concentrations (estimated concentrations in colon) were 1.50 mg/L for tigecycline and 26.40 mg/L for imipenem, with antibiotic-free curves as controls. Experiments were performed in triplicate. RESULTS: Imipenem showed inoculum effect against E.coli and B. fragilis, with reductions in initial inocula in experiments with standard inocula contrasting with increases in experiments with high inocula (both individual and mixed cultures). Against E. faecalis no inoculum effect for imipenem was observed in individual cultures, with marked reductions in initial inocula regardless inoculum size. However in mixed experiments the indirect protection of E. faecalis by the two gramnegatives resulted in bacterial regrowth. This protection was inoculum-dependant since it occurred with high but not with standard inocula. Tigecycline reduced initial inocula of the three isolates regardless culture type (individual/mixed) or experimental conditions (pH/inocula size), with lower reductions for the tolerant E. faecalis. CONCLUSION: Carbapenemase activity was inoculum-dependant for self-protection and indirect protection of E. faecalis.
TI  - Microwave-assisted synthesis, characterization and antibacterial activity of Ag/ZnO nanoparticles supported bentonite clay.
AB  - Composites of silver-zinc oxide nanoparticles supported on bentonite clay were synthesized by the microwave-assisted synthesis method for use as an antibacterial material. Silver nitrate was used as the precursor of silver nanoparticles while zinc oxide nanoparticles were commercially sourced. The composites were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscope (TEM), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and BET surface area measurements. XRD spectra showed peaks of silver confirming the formation of the silver and not of the silver nitrate or any other impurity of the metal. Meanwhile TEM confirmed the formation of silver and zinc oxide nanoparticles on the clay layers, with particle sizes ranging from 9-30 nm and 15-70 nm, respectively. The antibacterial activities of the composites were evaluated against Gram negative Escherichia coli bacteria and Gram positive Enterococcus faecalis bacteria by the disc diffusion method. Whereas both composites of Ag-clay and ZnO-clay showed good antibacterial activity against bacteria, a better antibacterial activity was observed with Ag/ZnO-clay composite. The results therefore reveal that Ag/ZnO-clay composite is a promising bactericide that can be used for deactivating microbes in water.
TI  - New function of molybdenum trioxide nanoplates: toxicity towards pathogenic bacteria through membrane stress.
AB  - Inorganic nanostructures are highly recognized for their potential use in the development of new functional materials for biomedical applications. In this study, we investigated the antibacterial efficiency of molybdenum trioxide (MoO3) nanoplates against four types of pathogenic bacteria. MoO3 nanoplates are synthesized by a simple wet chemical approach. X-ray diffraction and FT-IR analysis showed the presence of an orthorhombic phase of MoO3 nanoplates. Field emission scanning electron microscope studies confirmed the formation of plate-like structures of MoO3. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of MoO3 nanoplates against pathogenic bacteria was evaluated using a microdilution method. MICs such as 8mug/mL (against Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium), 16mug/mL (against Enterococcus faecalis), and 8mug/mL (against Bacillus subtilis) show that MoO3 nanoplates have predominant antibacterial activity compared to the standard antibiotic, kanamycin. Evaluation of bacterial enzymatic (beta-d-galactosidase) activity in the hydrolysis of o-nitrophenol and beta-d-galactopyranoside suggested the disruption of the bacterial cell wall mechanism responsible for bacterial toxicity.
TI  - Production of microbial medium from defatted brebra (Milletia ferruginea) seed flour to substitute commercial peptone agar.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate and optimize microbial media that substitute peptone agar using brebra seed defatted flour. METHODS: Defatted process, inoculums preparation, evaluation of bacterial growth, preparation of cooked and hydrolyzed media and growth turbidity of tested bacteria were determined. RESULTS: Two percent defatted flour was found to be suitable concentration for the growth of pathogenic bacteria: Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922) (E. coli), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853), Salmonella (NCTC 8385) and Shigella flexneri (ATCC 12022) (S. flexneri), while 3% defatted flour was suitable for Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923) (S. aureus). E. coli (93+/-1) and S. flexneri (524+/-1) colony count were significantly (P</=0.05) greater in defatted flour without supplement than in supplemented medium. E. coli [(3.72x10(9)+/-2) CFU/mL], S. aureus [(7.4x10(9)+/-2) CFU/mL], S. flexneri [(4.03x10(9)+/-2) CFU/mL] and Salmonella [(2.37x10(9)+/-1) CFU/mL] in non-hydrolyzed sample were statistically (P</=0.05) greater than hydrolyzed one and commercial peptone agar. Colony count of Salmonella [(4.55x10(9)+/-3) CFU/mL], S. flexneri [(5.40x10(9)+/-3) CFU/mL] and Lyesria moncytogenes (ATCC 19116) [(5.4x10(9)+/-3) CFU/mL] on raw defatted flour agar was significantly (P</=0.05) greater than cooked defatted flour and commercial peptone agar. Biomass of E. coli, S. aureus, Salmonella and Enterococcus faecalis in non-hydrolyzed defatted flour is highly increased over hydrolyzed defatted flour and commercial peptone broth. CONCLUSIONS: The defatted flour agar was found to be better microbial media or comparable with peptone agar. The substances in it can serve as sources of carbon, nitrogen, vitamins and minerals that are essential to support the growth of microorganisms without any supplements. Currently, all supplements of peptone agar are very expensive in the market.
TI  - Synthesis and Biological Evaluation of Some Novel 3,5-Disubstituted-1,2,4-triazole Incorporated 2-Mercaptobenzothiazoles.
AB  - Several 2-mercaptobenzothiazole derivatives 5a-i containing 1,2,4-triazole moiety incorporating two additional substituents were synthesized. All the newly synthesized compounds were tested for in vitro activity against certain strains of bacteria such as Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus coagulans, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Candida albicans. Compound 5a showed significant activity against the Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli. Compounds 5a-i were also screened for their antifungal activity against Candida albicans and compounds 5a, 5b, 5d and 5g displayed significant activity against this fungus. Some of these compounds were evaluated for their in vivo anti-inflammatory activity, acute toxicity and ulcerogenic actions. Tested compounds 5g and 5h showed significant anti-inflammatory activity and significant gastrointestinal protection compared to the standard drug diclofenac sodium. Molecular modeling studies of the synthesized compounds are presented.
TI  - Microwave assisted synthesis of dihydrobenzo[4,5]imidazo[1,2-a]pyrimidin-4-ones;  synthesis, in vitro antimicrobial and anticancer activities of novel coumarin substituted dihydrobenzo[4,5]imidazo[1,2-a]pyrimidin-4-ones.
AB  - The present article describes the synthesis of dihydrobenzo[4,5]imidazo[1,2-a]pyrimidin-4-one (2a-h) under microwave irradiation. The product was obtained in excellent yield (74-94%) in a shorter reaction time (2 min). These molecules (2a, b) further reacted with various substituted 4-bromomethylcoumarins (3a-f) to yield a new series of coumarin substituted dihydrobenzo[4,5]imidazo[1,2-a]pyrimidin-4-ones (4a-h). The structure of all the synthesized compounds were confirmed by spectral studies and screened for their in vitro antibacterial activity against three Gram-positive bacteria viz., Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus mutans and three Gram-negative bacteria viz., Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and antifungal activity against Candida albicans, Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus flavus, Fusarium oxysporum, Penicillium chrysogenum and anticancer activity against Dalton's Ascitic Lymphoma (DAL) cell line. In general, all the compounds possessed better antifungal properties than antibacterial properties. The coumarin substituted dihydrobenzo[4,5]imidazo[1,2-a]pyrimidin-4-one (4g) (R = i-Pr, R(1) = 6-Cl) was found to be the most potent cytotoxic compound (88%) against Dalton's Ascitic Lymphoma cell line at the concentration of 100 mug/mL.
TI  - Evaluation of the nanosphere verigene gram-positive blood culture assay with the  VersaTREK blood culture system and assessment of possible impact on selected patients.
AB  - The Verigene Gram-positive blood culture (BC-GP) assay (Nanosphere, Northbrook, IL) is a molecular method for the rapid identification of Gram-positive organisms and resistance markers directly from blood culture bottles. A total of 148 VersaTREK REDOX 1 40-ml aerobic bottles demonstrating Gram-positive bacteria were tested. Results were compared with those from conventional biochemical and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) identifications. We obtained isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (24), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) (14), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) (17), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus epidermidis (MSSE) (9), other coagulase-negative staphylococci (19), Streptococcus salivarius (5), Streptococcus parasanguinis (2), Streptococcus sanguinis (1), Streptococcus cristatus (1), the Streptococcus bovis group (5), Streptococcus agalactiae (9), the Streptococcus anginosus group (1), Streptococcus pneumoniae (6), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE FCM) (16), vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis (3), Aerococcus viridans (2), Bacillus (6), Corynebacterium (8), Lactobacillus (2), Micrococcus (2), Neisseria mucosa (1), Escherichia coli (3), Candida tropicalis (1), Propionibacterium (1), and Rothia (1). Overall agreement with the culture results was 95%. A total of 137 of 138 (99%) monomicrobial cultures were concordant. We tested 9 polymicrobial samples and found 33% agreement. A chart review of 31 patients with MRSA, MSSA, or VRE demonstrated that the Nanosphere BC-GP assay might have led to more appropriate antibiotic selection for these patients an average of 42 h earlier. Additionally, contact isolation could have been initiated an average of 37 h earlier for patients with MRSA or VRE. The BC-GP assay may have a positive impact on patient care, health care costs, and antibiotic stewardship.
TI  - Dissemination of antibiotic resistant Enterococcus spp. and Escherichia coli from wild birds of Azores Archipelago.
AB  - Antibiotic-resistant is profoundly important to human and animal health, but the  environmental reservoirs of resistance determinants are poorly understood, in particular in wild environments in remote Archipelagos. Moreover, the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in wild bird populations is rather unknown. In the present study, we used the Azores Islands as a model study for antimicrobial resistance in a remote Archipelago, and examined the antibiotic resistance profile in enterococci and Escherichia coli recovered from faecal samples of wild birds collected in this Archipelago. A total of 138 enterococci and 115 E. coli isolates were analyzed for resistance to antimicrobial agents. Of the enterococcal isolates, Enterococcus faecalis was the most prevalent detected species (59 isolates), followed by Enterococcus faecium (40 isolates), Enterococcus durans (27 isolates) and Enterococcus hirae (12 isolates). The enterococci strains showed high percentages of resistance to tetracycline (32.6%), to ciprofloxacin (19.6%) and to erythromycin (11.6%). Lower level of resistance (<10%) was detected for ampicillin, chloramphenicol and teicoplanin. One vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis isolate was detected and harbored the vanA resistant gene. Resistance genes detected included tet(M) and/or tet(L), ermB in all tetracycline and erythromycin-resistant isolates. Resistance in E. coli isolates was detected for ampicillin, tetracycline, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, streptomycin, and tobramycin. The blaTEM, aadA, aadA5, strA, strB, tet(A) and/or tet(B), and the intI genes were found in all ampicillin, streptomycin, tetracycline, and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim-resistant isolates respectively. The data shown in this study are essential to improve knowledge about the dissemination of resistant strains through wild birds from remote archipelagos such as the Azores Archipelago and the possible implications involved in transferring these resistances either to other animals or to humans.
TI  - Microbiological quality of ready-to-eat salads: an underestimated vehicle of bacteria and clinically relevant antibiotic resistance genes.
AB  - The increase demand for fresh vegetables is causing an expansion of the market for minimally processed vegetables along with new recognized food safety problems. To gain further insight on this topic we analyzed the microbiological quality of Portuguese ready-to-eat salads (RTS) and their role in the spread of bacteria carrying acquired antibiotic resistance genes, food products scarcely considered in surveillance studies. A total of 50 RTS (7 brands; split or mixed leaves, carrot, corn) were collected in 5 national supermarket chains in Porto region (2010). They were tested for aerobic mesophilic counts, coliforms and Escherichia coli counts as well as for the presence of Salmonella and Listeria monocytogenes. Samples were also plated in different selective media with/without antibiotics before and after enrichment. The E. coli, other coliforms and Enterococcus recovered were characterized for antibiotic resistance profiles and clonality with phenotypic and genetic approaches. A high number of RTS presented poor microbiological quality (86%--aerobic mesophilic counts, 74%--coliforms, 4%--E. coli), despite the absence of screened pathogens. In addition, a high diversity of bacteria (species and clones) and antibiotic resistance backgrounds (phenotypes and genotypes) were observed, mostly with enrichment and antibiotic selective media. E. coli was detected in 13 samples (n=78; all types and 4 brands; phylogenetic groups A, B1 and D; none STEC) with resistance to tetracycline [72%; tet(A) and/or tet(B)], streptomycin (58%; aadA and/or strA-strB), sulfamethoxazole (50%; sul1 and/or sul2), trimethoprim (50%; dfrA1 or dfrA12), ampicillin (49%; blaTEM), nalidixic acid (36%), ciprofloxacin (5%) or chloramphenicol (3%; catA). E. coli clones, including the widespread group D/ST69, were detected in different samples from the same brand or different brands pointing out to a potential cross-contamination. Other clinically relevant resistance genes were detected in 2 Raoultella terrigena carrying a bla(SHV-2) and 1 Citrobacter freundii isolate with a qnrB9 gene. Among Enterococcus (n=108; 35 samples; Enterococcus casseliflavus--40, Enterococcus faecalis--20, Enterococcus faecium--18, Enterococcus hirae--9, Enterococcus gallinarum--5, and Enterococcus spp.--16) resistance was detected for tetracyclines [6%; tet(M) and/or tet(L)], erythromycin [3%; erm(B)], nitrofurantoin (1%) or ciprofloxacin (1%). The present study places ready-to-eat salads within the spectrum of ecological niches that may be vehicles for antibiotic resistance bacteria/genes with clinical interest (e.g. E. coli-D-ST69; bla(SHV-2)) and these findings are worthy of attention as their spread to humans by ingestion cannot be dismissed.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of some medicinal plants from the cerrado of the centralwestern region of Brazil.
AB  - Ethanol extracts from six selected species from the Cerrado of the Central-Western region of Brazil, which are used in traditional medicine for the treatment of infectious diseases and other medical conditions, namely Erythroxylum suberosum St. Hil. (Erythroxylaceae), Hyptis crenata Pohl. ex Benth. (Lamiaceae), Roupala brasiliensis Klotz. (Proteaceae), Simarouba versicolor St. Hil. (Simaroubaceae), Guazuma ulmifolia Lam. (Sterculiaceae) and Protium heptaphyllum (Aubl.) March. (Burseraceae), as well as fractions resulting from partition of these crude extracts, were screened in vitro for their antifungal and antibacterial properties. The antimicrobial activities were assessed by the broth microdilution assay against six control fungal strains, Candida albicans, C. glabrata, C. krusei, C. parapsilosis, C. tropicalis and Cryptococcus neoformans, and five control Gram-positive and negative bacterial strains, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. Toxicity of the extracts and fractions against Artemia salina was also evaluated in this work. All plants investigated showed antimicrobial properties against at least one microorganism and two species were also significantly toxic to brine shrimp larvae. The results tend to support the traditional use of these plants for the treatment of respiratory and gastrointestinal disorders and/or skin diseases, opening the possibility of finding new antimicrobial agents from these natural sources. Among the species investigated, Hyptis crenata, Erythroxylum suberosum and Roupala brasiliensis were considered the most promising candidates for developing of future bioactivity-guided phytochemical investigations.
TI  - Utilization of major fucosylated and sialylated human milk oligosaccharides by isolated human gut microbes.
AB  - Human milk oligosaccharides (HMOS) are not digested in the proximal intestine. In distal intestine, HMOS collectively modify the microbiota, but the response of individual bacteria to individual components of the HMOS is not well defined. Here, each of 25 major isolates of the human intestinal microbiota was fed individual major fucosylated and sialylated HMOS in anaerobic culture. This allowed for an assessment of the influence of specific HMOS on the growth and metabolic products of individual microbiota bacteria. Most Bifidobacteria spp. and Bacteroides spp. grew, induced alpha-L-fucosidase activity, and produced abundant lactate or short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) when fed 2'-fucosyllactose (2'-FL), 3-FL, and lactodifucotetraose (LDFT). Lactobacillus delbrueckii ATCC7830, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC19433, and Streptococcus thermophilus ATCC19258 exhibited slight growth, pH reduction, and lactate production when supplemented with 2'-FL or 3-FL, but not LDFT. Supplementation with 3'-sialyllactose (3'-SL) and 6'-SL promoted moderate growth of Bifidobacterium longum JCM7007, 7009, 7010, 7011, 1272, 11347, ATCC15708, Bacteroides vulgatus ATCC8482, and B. thetaiotaomicron ATCC29148; accordingly, these bacteria exhibited greater neuraminidase activity and produced copious lactate, SCFA, or both. Lactobacillus delbrueckii ATCC7830 also consumed 6'-SL. In contrast, Clostridium spp., L. rhamnosus ATCC53103, E. faecalis ATCC29200, Staphylococcus spp., Enterobacter spp., and Escherichia coli K12 did not consume milk oligosaccharides nor produce appreciable acidic fermentation products. Specific Bifidobacteria and Bacteroides differentially digest specific individual HMOS, with the major fucosylated milk oligosaccharides most strongly stimulating key species of mutualist symbionts. This suggests strategies for treating dysbiosis of the microbiota and associated inflammatory disorders.
TI  - Surface activation of graphene oxide nanosheets by ultraviolet irradiation for highly efficient anti-bacterials.
AB  - A comprehensive investigation of anti-bacterial properties of graphene oxide (GO) and ultraviolet (UV) irradiated GO nanosheets was carried out. Microscopic characterization revealed that the GO nanosheet-like structures had wavy features and wrinkles or thin grooves. Fundamental surface chemical states of GO nanosheets (before and after UV irradiation) were investigated using x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) results revealed that UV irradiated GO nanosheets have more pronounced anti-bacterial behavior than GO nanosheets and standard antibiotic, kanamycin. The MIC of UV irradiated GO nanosheets was 0.125 mug ml(-)(1) for Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium, 0.25 mug ml(-)(1) for Bacillus subtilis and 0.5 mug ml(-)(1) for Enterococcus faecalis, ensuring its potential as an anti-infective agent for controlling the growth of pathogenic bacteria. The minimum bactericidal concentration of normal GO nanosheets was determined to be two-fold higher than its corresponding MIC value, indicating promising bactericidal activity. The mechanism of anti-bacterial action was evaluated by measuring the enzymatic activity of beta-D-galactosidase for the hydrolysis of o-nitrophenol-beta-D-galactopyranoside.
TI  - Alternating electric fields combined with activated carbon for disinfection of Gram negative and Gram positive bacteria in fluidized bed electrode system.
AB  - Strong electric fields for disinfection of wastewaters have been employed already for several decades. An innovative approach combining low strength (7 V/cm) alternating electric fields with a granular activated carbon fluidized bed electrode (FBE) for disinfection was presented recently. For disinfection performance of FBE several pure microbial cultures were tested: Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus subtilis subsp. subtilis, Enterococcus faecalis as representatives from Gram positive bacteria and Erwinia carotovora, Pseudomonas luteola, Pseudomonas fluorescens and Escherichia coli YMc10 as representatives from Gram negative bacteria. The alternating electric field amplitude and shape were kept constant. Only the effect of alternating electric field frequency on disinfection performance was investigated. From the bacteria tested, the Gram negative strains were more susceptible and the Gram positive microorganisms were more resistant to FBE disinfection. The collected data indicate that the efficiency of disinfection is frequency and strain dependent. During 6 h of disinfection, the decrease above 2 Log units was achieved with P. luteola and E. coli at 10 kHz and at dual frequency shift keying (FSK) modulated signal with frequencies of 10 kHz and 140 kHz. FBE technology appears to offer a new way for selective bacterial disinfection, however further optimizations are needed on treatment duration, and energy input, to improve effectiveness.
TI  - Culture independent Raman spectroscopic identification of urinary tract infection pathogens: a proof of principle study.
AB  - Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a very common infection. Up to every second woman will experience at least one UTI episode during her lifetime. The gold standard for identifying the infectious microorganisms is the urine culture. However, culture methods are time-consuming and need at least 24 h until the results are available. Here, we report about a culture independent identification procedure by using Raman microspectroscopy in combination with innovative chemometrics. We investigated, for the first time directly, urine samples by Raman microspectroscopy on a single-cell level. In a first step, a database of eleven important UTI bacterial species, which were grown in sterile filtered urine, was built up. A support vector machine (SVM) was used to generate a statistical model, which allows a classification of this data set with an accuracy of 92% on a species level. This model was afterward used to identify infected urine samples of ten patients directly without a preceding culture step. Thereby, we were able to determine the predominant bacterial species (seven Escherichia coli and three Enterococcus faecalis ) for all ten patient samples. These results demonstrate that Raman microspectroscopy in combination with support vector machines allow an identification of important UTI bacteria within two hours without the need of a culture step.
TI  - Correlations between Income inequality and antimicrobial resistance.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to investigate if correlations exist between income inequality and antimicrobial resistance. This study's hypothesis is that income inequality at the national level is positively correlated with antimicrobial resistance within developed countries. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Income inequality data were obtained from the Standardized World Income Inequality Database. Antimicrobial resistance data were obtained from the European antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Network and outpatient antimicrobial consumption data, measured by Defined daily Doses per 1000 inhabitants per day, from the European Surveillance of antimicrobial Consumption group. Spearman's correlation coefficient (r) defined strengths of correlations of: > 0.8 as strong, > 0.5 as moderate and > 0.2 as weak. Confidence intervals and p values were defined for all r values. Correlations were calculated for the time period 2003-10, for 15 European countries. RESULTS: Income inequality and antimicrobial resistance correlations which were moderate or strong, with 95% confidence intervals > 0, included the following. Enterococcus faecalis resistance to aminopenicillins, vancomycin and high level gentamicin was moderately associated with income inequality (r= >/=0.54 for all three antimicrobials). Escherichia coli resistance to aminoglycosides, aminopenicillins, third generation cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones was moderately-strongly associated with income inequality (r= >/=0.7 for all four antimicrobials). Klebsiella pneumoniae resistance to third generation cephalosporins, aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones was moderately associated with income inequality (r= >/=0.5 for all three antimicrobials). Staphylococcus aureus methicillin resistance and income inequality were strongly associated (r=0.87). CONCLUSION: As income inequality increases in European countries so do the rates of antimicrobial resistance for bacteria including E. faecalis, E. coli, K. pneumoniae and S. aureus. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings outside Europe and investigate the processes that could causally link income inequality and antimicrobial resistance.
TI  - Synthesis and characterization of novel organocobaloximes as potential catecholase and antimicrobial activity agents.
AB  - An asymmetric, potentially bidentate dioxime ligand (H(2)L) was formed by condensation of 4-biphenylchloroglyoxime and napthyl-1-amine. Two equivalents of H(2)L were reacted with CoCl(2) . 6H(2)O under appropriate conditions with deprotonation of the dioxime ligand. A series of new organocobaloxime derivatives of the type [CoR(HL)(2)Py], [CoRL(2)PyB(2)F(4)], and [CoRL(2)Py(Cu(phen))(2)] (H(2)L = 4-(napthyl-1-amino)biphenylglyoxime; phen = 1,10-phenathroline; R = izopropyl and benzyl; Py = pyridine) were synthesized. The products were characterized by elemental analysis, molar conductance, FT-IR, (1)H NMR, and magnetic susceptibility measurements. Catecholase-like activity properties of all complexes were also studied. All complexes are catalysts for the oxidation of 3,5-di-tert-butylcatechol to 3,5-di-tert-butyl-1,2-benzoquinone in methanol. Antimicrobial activity studies of H(2)L and the six complexes were carried out on standard strains (human pathogenic) of bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Pseudominas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi) and the yeast Candida albicans. The compounds showed a significant inhibition of the growth of the Gram-positive bacteria tested. Among the tested microorganisms, S. aureus was the most sensitive strain, especially to H(2)L and its complexes.
TI  - Lysozyme-encapsulated gold nanocluster-based affinity mass spectrometry for pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - RATIONALE: Bacterial infections can be difficult to treat and can lead to irreversible damage to patients if proper treatment is not provided in time. Additionally, the emerging threat from antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains makes medical treatment even more difficult. Thus, rapid identification of infected bacterial strains is essential to assist diagnostics and medical treatment. METHODS: Lysozymes are glycoside hydrolases that can bind with peptidoglycans on bacterial cell walls. In this work, we demonstrated that lysozyme-encapsulated gold nanoclusters (lysozyme-AuNCs) with red photoluminescence can be used as affinity probes to concentrate pathogenic bacteria. After bacteria had been probed by the lysozyme-AuNCs in a sample solution, the lysozyme-AuNC-bacteria conjugates were readily spun down at a low centrifugation speed. The red emission from the AuNCs on the conjugates could be visualized with the naked eye under illumination of ultraviolet light. The bacteria in the conjugates can be identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) combined with principal component analysis (PCA). RESULTS: We demonstrated that pathogenic bacteria including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, pandrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (VRE) can be readily concentrated by the lysozyme-AuNCs and distinguished by the results combining MALDI-MS and PCA. Additionally, the possibility of using the current approach to differentiate E. faecalis from VRE was also demonstrated. The lowest detection concentration for E. coli using the current approach is ~10(6) cells/mL. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicated that the lysozyme-AuNCs are effective affinity probes for Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. By combining the results from MALDI-MS and PCA, different bacteria can be easily distinguished. The current approach can be potentially used to assist the identification of bacteria from biological fluids.
TI  - [Comparative study of antimicrobial activity of "Biodentin" and "Rootdent" cements and "Futurabond NR" adhesive].
AB  - Bacterial contamination under fillings proved to be the main reason for pulp inflammation thus emphasizing the importance of antibacterial properties of restorative materials. The aim of the current study was to assess antibacterial properties of "Biodentine" (Septodont), "Rootdent" (TehnoDent) and adhesive "Futurabond capital EN, Cyrilliccapital ER, Cyrillic" (Voco). Two lines of experiments were carried out using cements water solutions and firm tablet-like samples (made by means of special pattern). All the examined materials showed antibacterial activity against E. coli, S. aureus, C. albismall es, Cyrillicans, Str. faecalis. The results confirm the analyzed materials to be a useful tool for deep caries lesions treatment.
TI  - Food-borne zoonotic pathogens and antimicrobial resistance of indicator bacteria  in urban wild boars in Barcelona, Spain.
AB  - Wildlife is increasingly abundant in urban environments, but little is known about the zoonotic pathogens carried by these populations. Urban wild boars are of particular concern because this species is well-known as a pathogen reservoir, and thus, we studied selected zoonotic pathogens in urban wild boars in Barcelona, Spain (n=41). Salmonella enterica was found in 5.00% (95% CI 0.61-16.91) and Campylobacter coli in 4.88% (95% CI 0.6-16.53) of the animals. E. coli O157:H7 and C. jejuni were not found. Other thermophilic Campylobacter were moderately prevalent (19.51%, 95% CI 8.82-34.87). Additionally, we screened for antimicrobial resistance in indicator bacteria: resistance was most frequent in Enterococcus faecium (95% of the isolates were resistant to at least one antimicrobial agent), followed by Enterococcus faecalis (50%) and Escherichia coli (10%). For the first time resistance to linezolid in bacteria carried by wildlife is reported. These findings pose a concern for public health, and thus, further research is needed on wildlife in urban environments.
TI  - Conducting nanosponge electroporation for affordable and high-efficiency disinfection of bacteria and viruses in water.
AB  - High-efficiency, affordable, and low energy water disinfection methods are in great need to prevent diarrheal illness, which is one of the top five leading causes of death over the world. Traditional water disinfection methods have drawbacks including carcinogenic disinfection byproducts formation, energy and time intensiveness, and pathogen recovery. Here, we report an innovative method that achieves high-efficiency water disinfection by introducing nanomaterial-assisted electroporation implemented by a conducting nanosponge filtration device. The use of one-dimensional (1D) nanomaterials allows electroporation to occur at only several volts, which is 2 to 3 orders of magnitude lower than that in traditional electroporation applications. The disinfection mechanism of electroporation prevents harmful byproduct formation and ensures a fast treatment speed of 15,000 L/(h.m(2)), which is equal to a contact time of 1 s. The conducting nanosponge made from low-cost polyurethane sponge coated with carbon nanotubes and silver nanowires ensures the device's affordability. This method achieves more than 6 log (99.9999%) removal of four model bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica Typhimirium, Enterococcus faecalis, and Bacillus subtilis, and more than 2 log (99%) removal of one model virus, bacteriophage MS2, with a low energy consumption of only 100 J/L.
TI  - Reduction of the neutralisation time during antimicrobial activity testing of disinfectants according to European Standards.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Evaluation of the biocidal activity of chemical disinfectants and antiseptics according to European Standards (EN) is based on determination of the reduction of the number of viable test microorganisms under defined conditions. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to investigate whether reducing the neutralization time required following declared product contact times for the tested microorganisms yields method validations. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study was conducted on 14 products containing active substances from different chemical groups: alcohols, aldehydes, biguanides, quaternary ammonium compounds, phenols, amines derivatives, oxidizing agents. These products were tested according to phase 1 tests: EN 1040:2005 and EN 1275:2005 and then according to phase 2, step 1 tests: Draft EN 13727:2005 and EN 13624:2003. Biocidal activity was evaluated using the following test organisms: S. aureus ATCC 6538, P. aeruginosa ATCC 15442, E. coli NCTC 10538, E. coli ATCC 10536, E. hirae ATCC 10541, C. albicans ATCC 10231 and A. brasiliensis ATCC 16404. RESULTS: Validation C results for all products and tested microorganism strains were at least half of the density of the suspension for validation (Nvo) after only 10 s of neutralization. Furthermore, results from test procedures performed in parallel were also positive except 5 products toward A. brasiliensis. CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study confirm that the contact time described in the European Standards phase 1: EN 1040 and EN 1275, as well as phase 2, step 1: Draft EN 13727 and EN 13624 can be precisely determined in spite of reducing the neutralization time from 5 minutes to even 10 seconds.
TI  - The diversity and antimicrobial activity of Preussia sp. endophytes isolated from Australian dry rainforests.
AB  - Limited knowledge currently exists regarding species diversity and antimicrobial  activity of endophytic isolates of Preussia within Australia. This report describes endophytic Preussia species that were identified through molecular analysis of the internal transcribed spacer region. Screening for antimicrobial secondary metabolites was determined by testing crude ethyl acetate (EtOAc) extracts derived from fungal mycelia against a panel of ATCC type strains which included Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and the opportunist yeast pathogen Candida albicans. Subsequently, high-performance liquid chromatography generated fractions of bioactive EtOAc extracts which were subject to confirmatory testing using the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute reference microdilution antimicrobial activity assay. A total of 18 Preussia were isolated from nine host plants with 6/18 having a <97 % sequence similarity to other known species in Genbank, suggesting that they are new species. In preliminary screening, 13/18 Preussia isolates revealed antimicrobial activity against at least one of the microbes tested, whilst 6/18 isolates, including 4/6 putative new species showed specific antimicrobial activity against MRSA and C. albicans. These results highlight the antimicrobial potential of Australian Preussia spp. and also the importance of Australian dry rainforests as an untapped repository of potentially significant bioactive compounds.
TI  - [Comparison of in vitro antimicrobial activities of bioaggregate and mineral trioxide aggregate].
AB  - Treatment outcome of endodontic perforations depends on successful elimination of the associated microorganisms and infected tissues as well as the effective seal of the root-end or perforation site to prevent future contamination. Ideally, perforation repair material has to be bacteriostatic or bactericidal in order to prevent bacterial contamination as well as good sealing properties and biocompatibility. The aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial effects of BioAggregate (BA) and Mineral Trioxide Aggregate (MTA) on the standard strains of Candida albicans, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguinis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa using the agar disc diffusion test. Colonies of each strains were harvested from the medium and microorganisms were diluted to obtain a suspension of approximately 108 cfu/ml. Petri plates with blood agar base with 5% sheep blood or Sabouraud dextrose agar (for C.albicans) were inoculated with experimental suspensions and BA and MTA discs prepared as 2 mm length and 6 mm diameter were placed. After 24 and 48 hours incubation, the diameters of the zones of inhibition were measured. The results of the disc diffusion tests showed that BA and MTA were effective on the tested microorganisms at 24 and 48 hours incubation periods. BA and MTA showed similar antimicrobial effects on C.albicans and E.coli. BA was more effective than MTA on S.mutans, E.faecalis and P.aeruginosa, however MTA was more effective than BA on S.sanguinis at 48 hours. When the time efficiency of the materials were compared, there was no statistically difference between 24 to 48 hours on E.coli, E.faecalis, S.mutans, S.sanguinis in both two groups (p> 0.05). There was statistically significant decrease 24 to 48 hours on C.albicans in BA and MTA groups and P.aeruginosa in BA group (p< 0.05). It can be concluded that although BA and MTA displayed similar antimicrobial efficacy on the tested microorganisms newly improved material BA demonstrated superior antimicrobial activity than other.
TI  - Mortality in kittens is associated with a shift in ileum mucosa-associated enterococci from Enterococcus hirae to biofilm-forming Enterococcus faecalis and adherent Escherichia coli.
AB  - Approximately 15% of foster kittens die before 8 weeks of age, with most of these kittens demonstrating clinical signs or postmortem evidence of enteritis. While a specific cause of enteritis is not determined in most cases, these kittens are often empirically administered probiotics that contain enterococci. The enterococci are members of the commensal intestinal microbiota but also can function as opportunistic pathogens. Given the complicated role of enterococci in health and disease, it would be valuable to better understand what constitutes a "healthy" enterococcal community in these kittens and how this microbiota is impacted by severe illness. In this study, we characterized the ileum mucosa-associated enterococcal community of 50 apparently healthy and 50 terminally ill foster kittens. In healthy kittens, Enterococcus hirae was the most common species of ileum mucosa-associated enterococci and was often observed to adhere extensively to the small intestinal epithelium. These E. hirae isolates generally lacked virulence traits. In contrast, non-E. hirae enterococci, notably Enterococcus faecalis, were more commonly isolated from the ileum mucosa of kittens with terminal illness. Isolates of E. faecalis had numerous virulence traits and multiple antimicrobial resistances. Moreover, the attachment of Escherichia coli to the intestinal epithelium was significantly associated with terminal illness and was not observed in any kitten with adherent E. hirae. These findings identify a significant difference in the species of enterococci cultured from the ileum mucosa of kittens with terminal illness compared to the species cultured from healthy kittens. In contrast to prior case studies that associated enteroadherent E. hirae with diarrhea in young animals, these controlled studies identified E. hirae as more often isolated from healthy kittens and adherence of E. hirae as more common and extensive in healthy kittens than in sick kittens.
TI  - The crystal structure of D-mandelate dehydrogenase reveals its distinct substrate and coenzyme recognition mechanisms from those of 2-ketopantoate reductase.
AB  - D-Mandelate dehydrogenases (D-ManDHs), belonging to a new d-2-hydroxyacid dehydrogenase family, catalyze the conversion between benzoylformate and d-mandelate using NAD as a coenzyme. We determined the first D-ManDH structure, that of ManDH2 from Enterococcus faecalis IAM10071. The overall structure showed ManDH2 has a similar fold to 2-ketopantoate reductase (KPR), which catalyzes the conversion of 2-ketopantoate to d-pantoate using NADP as a coenzyme. They share conserved catalytic residues, indicating ManDH2 has the same reaction mechanism as KPR. However, ManDH2 exhibits significant structural variations in the coenzyme and substrate binding sites compared to KPR. These structural observations could explain their different coenzyme and substrate specificities.
TI  - [System analysis of the relationship between the metabolism of vitamins by micro-biota and the survival of the positive microflora of the digestive tract].
AB  - A perspective direction of the treatment of dysbacteriosis is the use of so-called metabolic prebiotics--products of metabolism of positive flora (for example, water substrate of the products of metabolism of E. coli, S. faecalis, L. acidophilus, L. helveticus (strains of DSM), out of which, as known, drug Hylak Forte is made. Our earlier systematic analysis of metabolomics, representatives of positive microflora, pointed to the fact that the latter contain specific biochemical mechanisms for biosynthesis and processing of a number of vitamins. In the present paper the results of a systematic analysis of the effects of vitamins B2, B6 and K on the survival of the representatives of the positive microflora on the basis of the substrate of metabolic products of positive flora have been presented. The results of the analysis allow us clarify the molecular mechanisms of the therapeutic effects of this drug with a very complex structure and confirm the available clinical data and are an important foundation for subsequent microbiological research. Metabolites in the preparation composition contribute to the normalization of metabolism of pyridoxalphosphate (vitamin B6), flavin adenin dinucleotide (FAD, a derivative of vitamin B2) and nicotinamide dinucleotide (NAD, a derivative of vitamin B3)--cofactors of enzymes that have a significant impact on the survival of microbiota. The proposed molecular mechanisms also indicate on a possible synergies between certain vitamins and micro elements, on the one hand, and molecular components of the preparations on the basis of waste products of microbiota on the other.
TI  - A product of heme catabolism modulates bacterial function and survival.
AB  - Bilirubin is the terminal metabolite in heme catabolism in mammals. After deposition into bile, bilirubin is released in large quantities into the mammalian gastrointestinal (GI) tract. We hypothesized that intestinal bilirubin may modulate the function of enteric bacteria. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the effect of bilirubin on two enteric pathogens; enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC), a Gram-negative that causes life-threatening intestinal infections, and E. faecalis, a Gram-positive human commensal bacterium known to be an opportunistic pathogen with broad-spectrum antibiotic resistance. We demonstrate that bilirubin can protect EHEC from exogenous and host-generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) through the absorption of free radicals. In contrast, E. faecalis was highly susceptible to bilirubin, which causes significant membrane disruption and uncoupling of respiratory metabolism in this bacterium. Interestingly, similar results were observed for other Gram-positive bacteria, including B. cereus and S. aureus. A model is proposed whereby bilirubin places distinct selective pressure on enteric bacteria, with Gram-negative bacteria being protected from ROS (positive outcome) and Gram-positive bacteria being susceptible to membrane disruption (negative outcome). This work suggests bilirubin has differential but biologically relevant effects on bacteria and justifies additional efforts to determine the role of this neglected waste catabolite in disease processes, including animal models.
TI  - Trimebutine as a potential antimicrobial agent: a preliminary in vitro approach.
AB  - AIM: The aim of this preliminary study was to investigate the in vitro effect of  "non-antibiotic" trimebutine against reference strains Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213, ATCC 25923, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, ATCC 35218, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 and Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212; microbiota that are potentially involved in the pathophysiology of post-infectious functional gastrointestinal disorders. METHODS: Trimebutine activity was assessed by the broth microdilution method according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute recommendations against reference strains S. aureus ATCC 29213 and ATCC 25923, E. coli ATCC 25922 and ATCC 35218, P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 and E. faecalis ATCC 29212. Bactericidal activity of the compound was determined by spreading a 10 muL aliquot on Mueller-Hinton agar from each dilution showing non-visible growth. All tests were carried out in triplicate. RESULTS: Trimebutine was active against all strains tested presenting with MIC ranging from 1024 to 4000 mg/L. MIC and MBC were similar for E. coli ATCC 25922 and P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 whereas for Gram-positive isolates and E. coli ATCC 35218 the MBC was higher. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated the in vitro bacteriostatic/bactericidal activity of trimebutine against bacteria frequently colonizing the gastrointestinal tract and potentially involved in human gastrointestinal infections that might trigger post-infectious functional gastrointestinal disorders.
TI  - Rapid detection of bacteria in urine samples by the "three-plug-injection" method using capillary electrophoresis.
AB  - This study explored a method that can rapidly detect bacteria in urine samples for the auxiliary determination of urinary tract infections (UTIs). Urine samples from patients with UTIs (230 cases) were obtained using aseptic technique. The urine biochemical assay was then carried out using an automated urine analyzer for all the urine samples. Bacterial species were identified by a combination of bacterial culture technique, morphological observation and the BACT-IST microbial identification/susceptibility analysis system. The most common seven species of bacteria in the study included Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Bacterial samples were suspended in sample buffer solutions and separated by the "three-plug-injection" method using capillary electrophoresis (CE). Each species of bacteria appeared as a bacterial peak. The mixture of the seven species also provided only one peak. Further analysis showed that the concentration limit for the "three-plug-injection" method is 10(6) colony forming units (CFU)/mL, and there is a good linear relationship between the peak height and bacterial concentration (R(2)=0.99). The effect of urine composition on CE results was also investigated. The results showed that urine composition, i.e., proteins, white blood cells (WBCs) and red blood cells (RBCs), affected the peak retention time but could not affect the separation of bacteria. The results demonstrated that the bacteria in urine samples can be detected within 10min by the "three-plug-injection" method using CE. The "three-plug-injection" method is therefore suitable for the rapid detection of organisms in clinical urine samples from UTIs.
TI  - Rv3168 phosphotransferase activity mediates kanamycin resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
AB  - Tuberculosis is a worldwide epidemic disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, with an estimated one-third of the human population currently affected. Treatment of this disease with aminoglycoside antibiotics has become less effective owing to antibiotic resistance. Recent determination of the crystal structure of the M. tuberculosis Rv3168 protein suggests a structure similar to that of Enterococcus faecalis APH(3')-IIIa, and that this protein may be an aminoglycoside phosphotransferase. To determine whether Rv3168 confers antibiotic resistance against kanamycin, we performed dose-response antibiotic resistance experiments using kanamycin. Expression of the Rv3168 protein in Escherichia coli conferred antibiotic resistance against 100 muM kanamycin, a concentration that effected cell growth arrest in the parental E. coli strain and an E. coli strain expressing the Rv3168(D249A) mutant, in which the catalytic Asp249 residue was mutated to alanine. Furthermore, we detected phosphotransferase activity of Rv3168 against kanamycin as a substrate. Moreover, docking simulation of kanamycin into the Rv3168 structure suggests that kanamycin fits well into the substrate binding pocket of the protein, and that the phosphorylation-hydroxyl-group of kanamycin was located at a position similar to that in E. faecalis APH(3')-IIIa. On the basis of these results, we suggest that the Rv3168 mediates kanamycin resistance in M. tuberculosis, likely through phosphotransferase targeting of kanamycin.
TI  - Screening of antimicrobial activity and cytotoxic effects of two Cladonia species.
AB  - The present study explores the antimicrobial activity and cytotoxic effects in culture assays of two fruticose soil lichens, Cladonia rangiformis Hoffm. and Cladonia convoluta (Lamkey) Cout., to contribute to possible pharmacological uses of lichens. In vitro antimicrobial activities of methanol and chloroform extracts against two Gram-negative bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli), two Gram-positive bacteria (Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus), and the yeast Candida albicans were examined using the paper disc method and through determination of minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs). The data showed the presence of antibiotic substances in the chloroform and the methanol extracts of the lichen species. The chloroform extracts exhibited more significant antimicrobial activity than the methanol extracts. However, a higher antifungal activity was noted in the methanol extract of C. rangiformis. The maximum antimicrobial activity was recorded for the chloroform extract of C. convoluta against E. coli. The cytotoxic effects of the lichen extracts on human breast cancer MCF-7 cells were evaluated by the trypan blue assay yielding IC50 values of ca. 173 and 167 microg/ml for the extracts from C. rangiformis and C. convoluta, respectively.
TI  - Interdigitated silver-polymer-based antibacterial surface system activated by oligodynamic iontophoresis - an empirical characterization study.
AB  - There is a pressing need to control the occurrences of nosocomial infections due  to their detrimental effects on patient well-being and the rising treatment costs. To prevent the contact transmission of such infections via health-critical surfaces, a prophylactic surface system that consists of an interdigitated array of oppositely charged silver electrodes with polymer separations and utilizes oligodynamic iontophoresis has been recently developed. This paper presents a systematic study that empirically characterizes the effects of the surface system parameters on its antibacterial efficacy, and validates the system's effectiveness. In the first part of the study, a fractional factorial design of experiments (DOE) was conducted to identify the statistically significant system parameters. The data were used to develop a first-order response surface model to predict the system's antibacterial efficacy based on the input parameters. In the second part of the study, the effectiveness of the surface system was validated by evaluating it against four bacterial species responsible for several nosocomial infections - Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterococcus faecalis - alongside non-antibacterial polymer (acrylic) control surfaces. The system demonstrated statistically significant efficacy against all four bacteria. The results indicate that given a constant total effective surface area, the system designed with micro-scale features (minimum feature width: 20 mum) and activated by 15 muA direct current will provide the most effective antibacterial prophylaxis.
TI  - Czech ethanol-free propolis extract displays inhibitory activity against a broad  spectrum of bacterial and fungal pathogens.
AB  - Propolis acts primarily as a biocide against invasive bacteria and fungi in the hive, suggesting its potential for industrial applications. In food application, propolis is considered as a chemical preservative in meat products, extending shelf life of frozen meat and other food. The mechanism of action is still unclear due to the synergy of multiple compounds contained in propolis and due to parallel targeting of multiple pathways within each affected organism. Here, we examined the antimicrobial properties of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) Czech propolis extract. Until recently, DMSO was only rarely used in the propolis studies, although the other solvents tested (mostly ethanol) may significantly affect the observed inhibitory effects, notwithstanding the antimicrobial effects of ethanol itself. Here, we provide results of zone inhibition tests against Aspergillus fumigatus, Microsporum gypseum, Microsporum canis, Candida albicans, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, and Enterococcus faecalis. Although we determined inhibitory effects against all the microorganisms tested, the dose-dependent response curves were not similar to each other. While inhibitory effects against C. albicans or S. aureus were strictly dose-dependent, responses of M. gypseum and E. faecalis displayed plateau across the broad range of concentrations tested. Interestingly, response of E. coli revealed the double-peak dose-dependent curve, and responses of M. canis and L. monocytogenes decreased at the highest concentrations tested. Suggested is evaluation of DMSO propolis extracts in experimental treatment of human and veterinary infections, preferably in multitherapy with antibiotics.
TI  - Evaluation of pH, calcium ion release and antimicrobial activity of a new calcium aluminate cement.
AB  - This study evaluated the pH, calcium ion release and antimicrobial activity of EndoBinder (EB), containing different radiopacifiers: bismuth oxide (Bi2O3), zinc oxide (ZnO) or zirconium oxide (ZrO2), in comparison to MTA. For pH and calcium ion release tests, 5 specimens per group (n=5) were immersed into 10 mL of distilled and deionized water at 37 degrees C. After 2, 4, 12, 24, 48 h; 7, 14 and 28 days, the pH was measured and calcium ion release quantified in an atomic absorption spectrophotometer. For antimicrobial activity, the cements were tested against S. aureus, E. coli, E. faecalis and C. albicans, in triplicate. MTA presented higher values for pH and calcium ion release than the other groups, however, with no statistically significant difference after 28 days (p>0.05); and the largest inhibition halos for all strains, with no significant difference (E. coli and E. faecalis) for pure EB and EB+Bi2O3 (p>0.05). EB presented similar performance to that of MTA as regards pH and calcium ion release; however, when ZnO and ZrO2 were used, EB did not present antimicrobial activity against some strains.
TI  - Electrokinetic stringency control in self-assembled monolayer-based biosensors for multiplex urinary tract infection diagnosis.
AB  - Rapid detection of bacterial pathogens is critical toward judicious management of infectious diseases. Herein, we demonstrate an in situ electrokinetic stringency control approach for a self-assembled monolayer-based electrochemical biosensor toward urinary tract infection diagnosis. The in situ electrokinetic stringency control technique generates Joule heating induced temperature rise and electrothermal fluid motion directly on the sensor to improve its performance for detecting bacterial 16S rRNA, a phylogenetic biomarker. The dependence of the hybridization efficiency reveals that in situ electrokinetic stringency control is capable of discriminating single-base mismatches. With electrokinetic stringency control, the background noise due to the matrix effects of clinical urine samples can be reduced by 60%. The applicability of the system is demonstrated by multiplex detection of three uropathogenic clinical isolates with similar 16S rRNA sequences. The results demonstrate that electrokinetic stringency control can significantly improve the signal-to-noise ratio of the biosensor for multiplex urinary tract infection diagnosis. FROM THE CLINICAL EDITOR: Urinary tract infections remain a significant cause of mortality and morbidity as secondary conditions often related to chronic diseases or to immunosuppression. Rapid and sensitive identification of the causative organisms is critical in the appropriate management of this condition. These investigators demonstrate an in situ electrokinetic stringency control approach for a self-assembled monolayer-based electrochemical biosensor toward urinary tract infection diagnosis, establishing that such an approach significantly improves the biosensor's signal-to-noise ratio.

TI  - Oral application of bacterial lysate in infancy diminishes the prevalence of atopic dermatitis in children at risk for atopy.
AB  - Numerous interventions such as avoidance of food allergens, prolonged breast feeding and supplementation of pro-and/or prebiotics have been tried as primary prevention of atopic dermatitis. Recent data suggest that prevention of infantile eczema is possible in a subgroup of children by feeding bacterial lysates early in life. Bacterial lysates of Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis were found to impair allergic immune responses in rats. An interventional trial in 606 infants at risk for atopy showed a reduction of atopic dermatitis at the end of the treatment phase (month 2 until month 7) of 50% in a subgroup of children with single heredity for atopy. This was even more pronounced in the group of children with paternal heredity for atopy. This effect was still seen at age 1 year. There was no effect on food sensitisation. In conclusion, an immune modulation in terms of prevention of atopic dermatitis in infancy if single atopic family history is present seems to be possible by feeding bacterial lysates early in life.
TI  - Kinetic characterization of arginine deiminase and carbamate kinase from Streptococcus pyogenes M49.
AB  - Streptococcus pyogenes (group A Streptococcus, GAS) is an important human pathogen causing mild superficial infections of skin and mucous membranes, but also life-threatening systemic diseases. S. pyogenes and other prokaryotic organisms use the arginine deiminase system (ADS) for survival in acidic environments. In this study, the arginine deiminase (AD), and carbamate kinase (CK) from S. pyogenes M49 strain 591 were heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli DH5alpha, purified, and kinetically characterized. AD and CK from S. pyogenes M49 share high amino acid sequence similarity with the respective enzymes from Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis IL1403 (45.6% and 53.5% identical amino acids) and Enterococcus faecalis V583 (66.8% and 66.8% identical amino acids). We found that the arginine deiminase of S. pyogenes is not allosterically regulated by the intermediates and products of the arginine degradation (e.g., ATP, citrulline, carbamoyl phosphate). The Km and Vmax values for arginine were 1.13+/-0.12mM (mean+/-SD) and 1.51+/-0.07mumol/min/mg protein. The carbamate kinase is inhibited by ATP but unaffected by arginine and citrulline. The Km and Vmax values for ADP were 0.72+/-0.08mM and 1.10+/-0.10mumol/min/mg protein and the Km for carbamoyl phosphate was 0.65+/-0.07mM. The optimum pH and temperature for both enzymes were 6.5 and 37 degrees C, respectively.
TI  - Association of bacteria with marine invertebrates: implications for ballast water management.
AB  - Bacteria associated with plankton are of importance in marine bioinvasions and the implementation of ship's ballast water treatment technologies. In this study, epibiotic and endobiotic bacteria associated with zooplankton, including barnacle nauplii, veliger larvae, and adults of the copepod Oithona sp., were characterized and quantified. Barnacle nauplius and veliger larva harbored ~4.4 x 10(5)cells ind(-1) whereas Oithona sp. had 8.8 x 10(5)cells ind(-1). Computation of bacterial contribution based on biovolume indicated that despite being the smallest zooplankton tested, veliger larvae harbored the highest number of bacteria, while barnacle nauplii, the largest of the zooplankton, tested in terms of volume contributed the least. Pulverization of zooplankton led to an increase in bacterial numbers; for example, Vibrio cholerae, which was initially 3.5 x 10(3), increased to 5.4 x 10(5)CFU g(-1); Escherichia coli increased from 5.0 x 10(2) to 1.3 x 10(4)CFU g(-1); and Streptococcus faecalis increased from 2.1 x 10(2) to 2.5 x 10(5)CFU g(-1), respectively. Pulverized zooplankton was aged in the dark to assess the contribution of bacteria from decaying debris. Aging of pulverized zooplankton led to emergence of Chromobacterium violaceum, which is an opportunistic pathogen in animals and humans.
TI  - Bacterial lysates in food allergy prevention.
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In the concept of food allergy prevention, no successful strategy could be identified until now. Although interventional trials using probiotics, prebiotics, hydrolyzed formula and bacterial lysates early in infancy were found to reduce the incidence of atopic dermatitis, no effect on food sensitization and allergy could be shown. RECENT FINDINGS: Studies in a farming environment showed that early contact to livestock, bacteria and moulds may upregulate the immune responses regulated via Toll-like receptors and thus prevent allergy. There is increasing evidence that the unbalanced composition of the human microbiome on human skin and mucosal surfaces may be a key player in the development of inflammatory diseases like allergy and asthma. However, during the last 5 years, this concept could not yet be verified in the interventional trials. There are few studies using bacterial lysates, for example, Escherichia coli plus Enterococcus faecalis in ProSymbioflor and heat-killed Bifidobacterium breve and Streptococcus thermophilus; however, food allergy prevalence could not be reduced by these interventions. SUMMARY: During the last 5 years, new interventional trials addressed the use of bacterial lysates. There was only an effect on eczema in the ProSymbioflor trial, whereas the trial using B. breve and S. thermophilus in a cow's milk formula showed a slight reduction of food sensitization at the age of 12 months. However, these strategies need further investigation and success seems to be restricted to certain subpopulations.
TI  - Proteomics as a Quality Control Tool of Pharmaceutical Probiotic Bacterial Lysate Products.
AB  - Probiotic bacteria have a wide range of applications in veterinary and human therapeutics. Inactivated probiotics are complex samples and quality control (QC) should measure as many molecular features as possible. Capillary electrophoresis coupled to mass spectrometry (CE/MS) has been used as a multidimensional and high throughput method for the identification and validation of biomarkers of disease in complex biological samples such as biofluids. In this study we evaluate the suitability of CE/MS to measure the consistency of different lots of the probiotic formulation Pro-Symbioflor which is a bacterial lysate of heat-inactivated Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis. Over 5000 peptides were detected by CE/MS in 5 different lots of the bacterial lysate and in a sample of culture medium. 71 to 75% of the total peptide content was identical in all lots. This percentage increased to 87-89% when allowing the absence of a peptide in one of the 5 samples. These results, based on over 2000 peptides, suggest high similarity of the 5 different lots. Sequence analysis identified peptides of both E. coli and E. faecalis and peptides originating from the culture medium, thus confirming the presence of the strains in the formulation. Ontology analysis suggested that the majority of the peptides identified for E. coli originated from the cell membrane or the fimbrium, while peptides identified for E. faecalis were enriched for peptides originating from the cytoplasm. The bacterial lysate peptides as a whole are recognised as highly conserved molecular patterns by the innate immune system as microbe associated molecular pattern (MAMP). Sequence analysis also identified the presence of soybean, yeast and casein protein fragments that are part of the formulation of the culture medium. In conclusion CE/MS seems an appropriate QC tool to analyze complex biological products such as inactivated probiotic formulations and allows determining the similarity between lots.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of a UV-stable bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance (BLIS) produced by Enterococcus faecium strain DSH20 against vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) strains.
AB  - BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: The narrow spectrum of action of most bacteriocins is an important limitation for their application as antimicrobial agents. The current study describes a novel bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance (BLIS) that display extended spectrum antimicrobial activity against vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) strains. METHODS: Acquired resistance profiles of Enterococcus isolates determined based on the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) definition as multidrug-resistant (MDR), extensively drug-resistant (XDR) and pandrug resistant (PDR). BLIS activity of Enterococcus isolates was investigated against Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis) ATCC 29212 as the indicator strain and clinical isolates including VRE, methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Gram-negative bacteria containing Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa), Klebsiella, Acinetobacter, and Escherichia coli (E. coli). RESULTS: Among 273 Enterococcus isolates, 27 and 2 VRE isolates, respectively, were XDR and PDR and eight isolates had BLIS activity against the indicator strain. One of these isolates, identified as E. faecium strain DSH20 based on its phenotypical and biochemical properties, as well as its 16S rRNA gene sequence, had potent BLIS production against all 29 VRE strains, but had no activity against MRSA, P. aeruginosa, Klebsiella, Acinetobacter, and E. coli strains. It was heat stable up to 121 degrees C for 15 minutes (autoclave condition), active within the pH range of 3-9 and had UV stability, but its activity disappeared by treatment with proteinase K, pepsin, and trypsin, demonstrating its proteinaceous nature. It was designated as an approximately 35kDa peptide using the sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) method. CONCLUSION: This peptide is a potential agent for use as an alternative antibacterial agent for the treatment of drug-resistant strains of VRE infection.
TI  - Bacterial infections of the lower genital tract in fertile and infertile women from the southeastern Poland.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objective of the study was to investigate the detection rates of  Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Mycoplasma genitalium, Mycoplasma hominis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Gardnerella vaginalis, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus agalactiae and Enterococcus faecalis, showing no clinical signs of an ongoing, acute inflammatory state of the vagina and/or the cenrvix, in fertile and infertile women. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study encompassed 161 women, including 101 women treated for infertility and 60 fertile women who had already given birth to healthy children. The material for the presence of C. trachomatis, N. gonorrhoeae, M. genitalium, M. hominis and U. urealyticum was collected from the cervical canal and analyzed by PCR. Furthermore, BD ProbeTec ET system was used to detect C. trachomatis infection. Vaginal swabs were collected for classification of bacterial vaginosis and aerobic vaginitis and assessed according to the Nugent score, as well as by traditional culture methods. RESULTS: U. urealyticum was identified in 9% of the infertile women and in 8% of controls. Presence of M. hominis was demonstrated only in the former (4%) and C. trachomatis only in latter (3%). N. gonorrhoeae and M. genitalium were not found in any of the examined women. The frequency of aerobic vaginitis in both groups was estimated at 12%. There were 7% bacterial vaginosis cases in the study group, and none in the control group (p=0.0096). CONCLUSIONS: Despite having no symptoms of an ongoing acute inflammation of the reproductive tract, many women may experience permanent or periodic shifts of equilibrium of the vaginal and/or cervical microflora. BV develops more frequently in infertile patients when compared to the fertile women.
TI  - Resistance mechanisms and epidemiology of multiresistant pathogens in Europe and  efficacy of tigecycline in observational studies.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Antimicrobial drug resistance is a growing problem in Europe and, even with differences in epidemiology, it is of great concern. The treatment of complicated skin and soft-tissue infections (cSSTIs) and complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAIs) is hindered further by pathogens that are resistant to methicillin, carbapenems, third-generation cephalosporins and glycopeptides. PATIENTS AND METHODS: An analysis of the microbiological results from five European observational studies (July 2006 to October 2011) evaluating the efficacy of tigecycline (prescribed as monotherapy or in combination with other antibacterials) for the treatment of cSSTI and cIAI is presented. RESULTS: In total, 213 cSSTI and 623 cIAI patients were included; 34.4% and 56.6%, respectively, were critically ill in intensive care units. At baseline, at least one pathogen was isolated in 167 (78.4%) cSSTI and 464 (74.5%) cIAI patients, and 32.9% and 49.1% of infections were polymicrobial. In cSSTI, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli (52.7% and 18.0%, respectively) were the most frequently isolated pathogens, whereas in cIAI most infections were due to E. coli (41.8%), Enterococcus faecium (40.1%) and Enterococcus faecalis (21.1%). Clinical response was observed in >80% of patients with E. coli in both cIAI and cSSTI. In cSSTI patients, the clinical response rate to S. aureus was 80.8%. For cIAI, 77.4% of E. faecium and 79.5% of E. faecalis patients responded to treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Tigecycline when given alone or in combination with other antibacterials appeared to be efficacious against multiple pathogens, affirming its role in real-life clinical practice as a broad-spectrum antibacterial for the treatment of patients with cSSTI and cIAI, including the critically ill, across Europe.
TI  - Efficacy of tigecycline for the treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections in real-life clinical practice from five European observational studies.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Tigecycline is a broad-spectrum antibiotic approved for the treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAIs). The efficacy of tigecycline when administered as monotherapy or in combination with other antibacterials in the treatment of cIAIs in routine clinical practice is described. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Individual patient-level data were pooled from five European observational studies (July 2006 to October 2011). RESULTS: A total of 785 cIAI patients who received tigecycline were included (mean age 63.1 +/- 14.0 years). Of these, 56.6% were in intensive care units, 65.6% acquired their infection in hospital, 88.1% had at least one comorbidity and 65.7% had secondary peritonitis. The mean Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores at the beginning of treatment were 16.9 +/- 7.6 (n = 614) and 7.0 +/- 4.2 (n = 108), respectively, indicating high disease severity. Escherichia coli (41.8%), Enterococcus faecium (40.1%) and Enterococcus faecalis (21.1%) were the most frequently isolated pathogens; 49.1% of infections were polymicrobial and 17.5% were due to resistant pathogens. Overall, 54.8% (n = 430) received tigecycline as monotherapy and 45.2% (n = 355) as combination therapy for a mean duration of 10.6 days. Clinical response rates at the end of treatment were 77.4% for all patients (567/733), 80.6% for patients who received tigecycline as monotherapy (329/408), 75.2% for patients with a nosocomial infection (354/471), 75.8% for patients with an APACHE II score >15 (250/330) and 54.2% (32/59) for patients with a SOFA score >/= 7. CONCLUSIONS: In these real-life studies, tigecycline, alone and in combination, achieved favourable clinical response rates in patients with cIAI with a high severity of illness.
TI  - Bactericidal efficacy of elevated pH on fish pathogenic and environmental bacteria.
AB  - Ship ballast water is a recognized medium for transfer and introductions of nonindigenous species. There is a need for new ballast water treatment methods that effectively and safely eliminate or greatly minimize movements of these species. The present study employed laboratory methods to evaluate the bactericidal efficacy of increased pH (pH 10.0-12.0) for exposure durations of up to 72 h to kill a variety of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria including fish pathogens (Aeromonas spp., Yersinia ruckeri, Edwardsiella ictaluri, Serratia liquefaciens, Carnobacterium sp.), other common aquatic-inhabitant bacteria (Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Staphylococcus sp., Bacillus sp.) and indicators listed in International Maritime Organization D2 Standards; namely, Vibrio cholera (an environmental isolate from fish), Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis. Volumes of 5 N NaOH were added to tryptic soy broth to obtain desired pH adjustments. Viable cells were determined after 0, 4, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h. Initial (0 h) cell numbers ranged from 3.40 x 10(4) cfu/mL for Bacillus sp. to 2.44 x 10(7) cfu/mL for E. faecalis. The effective endpoints of pH and treatment duration necessary to realize 100% bactericidal effect varied; however, all bacteria tested were killed within 72 h at pH 12.0 or lower. The lowest parameters examined, 4 h at pH 10.0, were bactericidal to V. cholera, E. ictaluri, three of four isolates of E. coli, and (three of four) Aeromonas salmonicida subsp. salmonicida. Bactericidal effect was attained at pH 10.0 within 12 h for the other A. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida, and within 24 h for P. fluorescens, and the remaining E. coli.
TI  - Impact of chlorine dioxide gas sterilization on nosocomial organism viability in  a hospital room.
AB  - To evaluate the ability of ClO2 to decontaminate pathogens known to cause healthcare-associated infections in a hospital room strains of Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Mycobacterium smegmatis, and Staphylococcus aureus were spot placed in duplicate pairs at 10 sites throughout a hospital room and then exposed to ClO2 gas. Organisms were collected and evaluated for reduction in colony forming units following gas exposure. Six sterilization cycles with varied gas concentrations, exposure limits, and relative humidity levels were conducted. Reductions in viable organisms achieved ranged from 7 to 10-log reductions. Two sterilization cycles failed to produce complete inactivation of organisms placed in a bathroom with the door closed. Reductions of organisms in the bathroom ranged from 6-log to 10-log reductions. Gas leakage between hospital floors did not occur; however, some minor gas leakage from the door of hospital room was measured which was subsequently sealed to prevent further leakage. Novel technologies for disinfection of hospital rooms require validation and safety testing in clinical environments. Gaseous ClO2 is effective for sterilizing environmental contamination in a hospital room. Concentrations of ClO2 up to 385 ppm were safely maintained in a hospital room with enhanced environmental controls.
TI  - Bacterial colonization of microbial biofilms in oral squamous cell carcinoma.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this prospective clinical study was to identify the bacterial spectra on the surface of oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCC) in comparison to oral mucosa of patients with a higher risk to emerge an OSCC and a control group to determine their susceptibility to various common antibiotics. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Swabs from 90 patients, 30 patients of each group, were cultured on media for aerobes and anaerobes and tested with agar diffusion and Etest. RESULTS: The predominant pathogens of the normal healthy oral mucosa were aerobes. The ratio between aerobes and anaerobes was 2:1, balanced in risk patients and inverted in the OSCC group. Altogether, 1,006 isolates were cultured. The most frequent strains were 47 viridans streptococci, 30 Staphylococcus species, 14 Enterococcus faecalis, 36 Neisseria species, 14 Escherichia coli, and 23 other aerobes, 66 Peptostreptococcus species, 39 Fusobacterium species, and 34 Prevotella species. The resistance rates in the OSCC group were penicillin 40%, ampicillin 57%, doxycycline 23%, clindamycin 47%, and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid 20%, but up to 100% of pathogens were susceptible to azithromycin, telithromycin, levofloxacin, and moxifloxacin. CONCLUSION: Gram-negative anaerobes play a decisive role in the development of postoperative infections in patients with OSCC. This tumor special type of colonization does not agree with the normal flora of the oral cavity. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Biofilms on OSCC surfaces provide an important reservoir for anaerobic bacteria. As a consequence, a proposal for an antibiotic prophylactic regime should be given.
TI  - Human colonic mucus is a reservoir for antimicrobial peptides.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: To prevent bacterial adherence and translocation, the colonic mucosa is covered by a protecting mucus layer and the epithelium synthesizes antimicrobial peptides. The present qualitative study investigated the contents and interaction of these peptides in and with rectal mucus. METHODS: Rectal mucus extracts were analyzed for antimicrobial activity and screened with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, Dot blot and immunohistochemistry for antimicrobial peptides. In addition, binding of AMPs to mucins was investigated by Western blot and enzyme-linked lectin assays. RESULTS: In functional tests the mucus layer exhibited a strong antimicrobial activity. We detected 11 antimicrobial peptides in mucus extracts from healthy persons including the defensins HBD-1 and -3, the cathelicidin LL-37, ubiquitin, lysozyme, histones, high mobility group nucleosome-binding domain-containing protein 2, ubiquicidin and other ribosomal proteins. AMPs were bound by mucins but this was demonstrated to be reversible and inhibition of antibacterial activity was limited. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that epithelial antimicrobial peptides are retained in the intestinal mucus layer without losing their efficacy. Thus, the mucus layer and its composition provide an attractive drug target to restore antimicrobial barrier function in intestinal diseases.
TI  - Photodynamic effect of hypericin on the microorganisms and primary human fibroblasts.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypericin (HYP) is a natural photosensitizer considered for the new generation of photodynamic therapy (PDT) drugs. The aim of this study was to evaluate the in vitro bactericidal effect of HYP-PDT on four bacterial species, assessing its photocytotoxicity to primary human fibroblasts to determine possible side effects. METHODS: Effect of photosensitizer concentration (0.1, 0.3, 0.6, and 1 mug/ml) and light irradiation time (3, 5, 10 min) on photodynamic inactivation of microorganisms and primary human fibroblasts was investigated. RESULTS: A 6.3 log killing was obtained for Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923) treated with 1 mug/ml at 48 J/cm(2). For this set of PDT parameters, Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 11700) showed 6.5 log killing, Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922) 6.2 log killing, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853) 0.7 log killing. Fibroblasts can be preserved by keeping the HYP concentration below 0.6 mug/ml and the light dose below 48 J/cm(2). CONCLUSION: S. aureus, E. faecalis, and E. coli appear to be suitable for treatment with HYP-PDT without significant damage to fibroblasts.
TI  - Preparation, characterization and antibacterial activity of poly(epsilon-caprolactone) electrospun fibers loaded with amoxicillin for controlled release in biomedical applications.
AB  - Amoxicillin (AMOX) was successfully encapsulated at different concentrations into poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL) by the electrospinning technique, and mats of non-woven fibers were obtained and characterized in terms of morphology, in vitro release and antibacterial properties. The scanning electron microscopy evidenced the nanofibrous structure of the pristine PCL, composed of individual, uniform, and randomly oriented fibres with an average diameter ranging around 0.8 micron. The addition of amoxicillin at different concentrations (3, 5 and 7 wt%) did not evidence change in the fiber morphology. The release curves, for all samples, present mainly two stages: a first stage, quick as a "burst," is followed by a second slow stage. The burst was analyzed as a function of amoxicillin concentration and thickness of the membranes, and values corresponding to absence of burst were individuated. In the second stage the release was found very slow extending up to months for the most concentrated sample. The antibacterial activity of the electrospun fibers was effective to inhibit in different proportions Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli. The properties of the filled membranes and their capability for local delivery of antibiotics make them suitable for biomedical applications.
TI  - Antioxidant and antimicrobial activities, and phenolic compounds of selected Inula species from Turkey.
AB  - Three Inula species, I. viscosa, I. helenium ssp. turcoracemosa and I. montbretiana, collected from different locations of Anatolia were investigated for their antioxidant and antimicrobial potential, and their total phenolic content and phenolic composition. Antioxidant activities of various extracts of the plant parts were measured using DPPH radical scavenging and ABTS assays. Antimicrobial potential of methanol extracts of the plant parts was determined by the agar dilution method against Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans and Candida tropicalis. All the extracts were more active against Gram-positive bacteria and yeasts than Gram-negative bacteria. The extracts exhibited antioxidant and antimicrobial activities in different concentrations. Total phenolic concentration of the extracts was estimated with Folin-Ciocalteu reagent using gallic acid as standard. The total phenolic content varied widely in different parts of the three tested Inula species, ranging from 21.1 +/- 0.8 to 190.9 +/- 6.1 mg GAE/g extract. Phenolic components, such as chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, rutin, myricetin, quercetin, luteolin and kaempferol were quantified by HPLC-DAD in the methanol extracts of the Inula species. It was obvious that the antioxidant and antimicrobial properties of the plants were due to the phenolics.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of organisms causing community-acquired urinary tract infections in Gauteng Province, South Africa.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with community-acquired urinary tract infections (UTIs) frequently present to healthcare facilities in South Africa (SA). AIM: To provide information on UTI aetiology and antimicrobial susceptibility of pathogens. METHODS: We recruited women with UTI-related symptoms, who tested positive for >/=2 urine dipstick criteria (proteinuria, blood, leucocytes or nitrites) at 1 public and 5 private primary healthcare facilities in 2011. Demographic and clinical data were recorded and mid-stream urine (MSU) specimens were cultured. UTI pathogens were Gram-stained and identified to species level. Etest-based antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed for amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, cefixime, cefuroxime, ciprofloxacin, fosfomycin, levofloxacin, nitrofurantoin, norfloxacin and trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole. RESULTS: Of the 460 women recruited, 425 MSU samples were processed and 204 UTI pathogens were identified in 201 samples. Most pathogens were Gram-negative bacilli (GNB) (182; 89.2%) and 22 (10.8%) were Gram-positive cocci (GPC). Escherichia coli was the most frequent GNB (160; 79.6%), while Enterococcus faecalis was the predominant GPC (8; 4.0%). The UTI pathogens had similar susceptibility profiles for fosfomycin (95.5%; 95% confidence interval (CI) 92.6 - 98.4), the 3 fluoroquinolones (94.1%; 95% CI 90.8 - 97.4), nitrofurantoin (91.7%; 95% CI 87.8 - 95.6), cefuroxime (90.1%; 95% CI 86.0 - 94.3) and cefixime (88.2%; 95% CI 83.7 - 92.6). UTI pathogens were less susceptible to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (82.8%; 95% CI 77.5 - 88.0) when compared with fluoroquinolones and fosfomycin. Trimethoprim/ sulphamethoxazole was the least efficacious antimicrobial agent (44.3% susceptible; 95% CI 37.4 - 51.2). CONCLUSION: This study provides relevant data for the empirical treatment of community-acquired UTIs in SA.
TI  - Engineering solutions to improve the removal of fecal indicator bacteria by bioinfiltration systems during intermittent flow of stormwater.
AB  - Bioinfiltration systems facilitate the infiltration of urban stormwater into soil and reduce high flow events and flooding. Stormwater carries a myriad of pollutants including fecal indicator bacteria (FIB). Significant knowledge gaps exist about the ability of bioinfiltration systems to remove and retain FIB. The present study investigates the ability of model, simplified bioinfiltration systems containing quartz sand and iron oxide-coated quartz sand (IOCS) to remove two FIB (Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli) suspended in synthetic stormwater with and without natural organic matter (NOM) as well as the potential for accumulated FIB to be remobilized during intermittent flow. The experiments were conducted in two phases: (1) the saturated columns packed with either sand or IOCS were contaminated by injecting stormwater with bacteria followed by injection of sterile stormwater and (2) the contaminated columns were subjected to intermittent infiltration of sterile stormwater preceded by a pause during which columns were either kept saturated or drained by gravity. During intermittent flow, fewer bacteria were released from the saturated column compared to the column drained by gravity: 12% of attached E. coli and 3% of attached Ent. faecalis were mobilized from the drained sand column compared to 3% of attached E. coli and 2% attached Ent. faecalis mobilized from the saturated sand column. Dry and wet cycles introduce moving air-water interfaces that can scour bacteria from grain surfaces. During intermittent flows, less than 0.2% of attached bacteria were mobilized from IOCS, which bound both bacteria irreversibly in the absence of NOM. Addition of NOM, however, increased bacterial mobilization from IOCS: 50% of attached E. coli and 8% of attached Ent. faecalis were released from IOCS columns during draining and rewetting. Results indicate that using geomedia such as IOCS that promote irreversible attachment of bacteria, and maintaining saturated condition, could minimize the mobilization of previous attached bacteria from bioinfiltration systems, although NOM may significantly decrease these benefits.
TI  - Epidemiology of urinary tract infection among spinal cord injured patients in rehabilitation ward at Siriraj Hospital.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: A prophylactic antibiotic in retrograde investigations  (Ix) such as an urodynamic study was suggested by the European Association of Urology in order to prevent urinary tract infection (UTI) in the neurogenic bladder However finding an appropriate antibiotic is questionable since bacterial types and their sensitivities are variable in different settings. Therefore, the present study was aimed to find out the epidemiology of UTI in spinal cord injured (SCI) patients within the rehabilitation ward at Siriraj Hospital. MATERIAL AND METHOD: A retrospective chart review of 100 SCI patients admitted to the rehabilitation ward between 2006 and 2010 was done. Symptomatic UTI events, urine cultures, and sensitivities (C/S) were reviewed Demographic data and possible UTI-associated factors were collected and examined the association with the occurrence of UTI RESULTS: There were 64 males and 36 females with a mean age of 42.9 (SD 15.8) years. Most of them (77%) were injured at cervical and thoracic spinal cords. Forty-five patients had 57 UTI episodes. Escherichia coli was the most common isolated pathogen (50%), followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (17.3%), and Enterococcus faecalis (7.7%). The top three most sensitive antibiotics were imipenem, amikacin, and piperacillin/tazobactam. Unfortunately, gentamicin, ceftriaxone, and ciprofloxacin, which were frequently used as a prophylactic antibiotic, had the efficacy for only 51.9%, 38.5%, and 28.8% ofpathogens respectively. The mean length ofstay ofpatients with UTI was far greater than non-UTI patients, 45.5 (SD 24.4) versus 30.4 (SD 14.8) days (p = 0.001). Vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) (OR 21.2, 95% CI2.1 to 214.2) and increased intravesical pressure at storage phase (OR 1.1, 95% CI 1.004-1.113) were significant riSk factors for post investigation UTI. CONCLUSION: UTI was commonly observed in SCI patients within the rehabilitation ward The most common uropathogen was Escherichia coli. Therefore, a prophylactic antibiotic such as amikacin should be prescribed in patients with VUR and increased intravesical pressure at storage phase.
TI  - Internalisation potential of Escherichia coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium and Staphylococcus aureus in lettuce seedlings and mature plants.
AB  - The internalisation potential of Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium in lettuce was evaluated using seedlings grown in vermiculite in seedling trays as well as hydroponically grown lettuce. Sterile distilled water was spiked with one of the four human pathogenic bacteria (10(5) CFU/mL) and used to irrigate the plants. The potential for pathogen internalisation was investigated over time using light microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and viable plate counts. Additionally, the identities of the pathogens isolated from internal lettuce plant tissues were confirmed using polymerase chain reaction with pathogen-specific oligonucleotides. Internalisation of each of the human pathogens was evident in both lettuce seedlings and hydroponically grown mature lettuce plants. To our knowledge, this is the first report of S. aureus internalisation in lettuce plants. In addition, the levels of background microflora in the lettuce plants were determined by plate counting and the isolates identified using matrix-assisted laser ionisation-time of flight (MALDI-TOF). Background microflora assessments confirmed the absence of the four pathogens evaluated in this study. A low titre of previously described endophytes and soil inhabitants, i.e., Enterobacter cloacae, Enterococcus faecalis, Lysinibacillus fusiformis, Rhodococcus rhodochrous, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus hominis were identified.
TI  - Anti-infective potential of marine invertebrates and seaweeds from the Brazilian  coast.
AB  - This manuscript describes the evaluation of anti-infective potential in vitro of  organic extracts from nine sponges, one ascidian, two octocorals, one bryozoan, and 27 seaweed species collected along the Brazilian coast. Antimicrobial activity was tested against Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923), Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29212), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853), Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922) and Candida albicans (ATCC 10231) by the disk diffusion method. Antiprotozoal activity was evaluated against Leishmania braziliensis (MHOM/BR/96/LSC96-H3) promastigotes and Trypanosoma cruzi (MHOM/BR/00/Y) epimastigotes by MTT assay. Activity against intracellular amastigotes of T. cruzi and L. brasiliensis in murine macrophages was also evaluated. Antiviral activity was tested against Herpes Simplex Virus type 1 (HSV-1, KOS strain) by the plaque number reduction assay (IC(5)(0)). Cytotoxicity on VERO cells was evaluated by the MTT assay (CC(5)(0)). The results were expressed as SI = CC(5)(0)/IC(5)(0). The most promising antimicrobial results were obtained against S. aureus and C. albicans with Dragmacidon reticulatum. Among the seaweeds, only Osmundaria obtusiloba showed moderate activity against P. aeruginosa. Concerning antiprotozoal activity, Bugula neritina, Carijoa riseii, Dragmaxia anomala and Haliclona (Halichoclona) sp. showed the most interesting results, mainly against extracellular promastigote forms of L. braziliensis (66, 35.9, 97.2, and 43.6% inhibition, respectively). Moreover, six species of seaweeds Anadyomene saldanhae, Caulerpa cupressoides, Canistrocarpus cervicornis, Dictyota sp., Ochtodes secundiramea, and Padina sp. showed promising results against L. braziliensis (87.9, 51.7, 85.9, 93.3, 99.7, and 80.9% inhibition, respectively), and only Dictyota sp. was effective against T. cruzi (60.4% inhibition). Finally, the antiherpes activity was also evaluated, with Haliclona (Halichoclona) sp. and Petromica citrina showing the best results (SI = 11.9 and SI > 5, respectively). All the active extracts deserve special attention in further studies to chemically characterize the bioactive compounds, and to perform more refined biological assays.
TI  - Short-term inactivation rates of selected Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria attached to metal oxide mineral surfaces: role of solution and surface chemistry.
AB  - Metal oxides such as ferric or aluminum oxides can play an important role in the  retention of bacteria in granular aquatic environments; however, their role in bacterial inactivation is not well understood. Herein, we examined the role of water chemistry and surface chemistry on the short-term inactivation rates of three bacteria when adhered to surfaces. To evaluate the role of water chemistry on the inactivation of attached bacteria, the loss in membrane integrity of bacteria attached to an iron oxide (Fe2O3) surface was measured over a range of water ionic strengths of either monovalent or divalent salts in the absence of a growth substrate. The influence of surface chemistry on the inactivation of attached bacteria was examined by measuring the loss in membrane integrity of cells attached to three surfaces (SiO2, Fe2O3, and Al2O3) at a specific water chemistry (10 mM KCl). Bacteria were allowed to attach onto the SiO2 or metal oxide coated slides mounted in a parallel-plate flow cell, and their inactivation rate (loss in membrane integrity) was measured directly without removing the cells from the surface and without disturbing the system. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis revealed a high correlation between the amounts of C-metal or O-metal bonds and the corresponding bacterial inactivation rates for each surface. Finally, for all three surfaces, a consistent increase in inactivation rate was observed with the type of bacterium in the order: Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli O157:H7, and Escherichia coli D21f2.
TI  - Volatile metabolites of pathogens: a systematic review.
AB  - Ideally, invading bacteria are detected as early as possible in critically ill patients: the strain of morbific pathogens is identified rapidly, and antimicrobial sensitivity is known well before the start of new antimicrobial therapy. Bacteria have a distinct metabolism, part of which results in the production of bacteria-specific volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which might be used for diagnostic purposes. Volatile metabolites can be investigated directly in exhaled air, allowing for noninvasive monitoring. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of VOCs produced by the six most abundant and pathogenic bacteria in sepsis, including Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli. Such VOCs could be used as biological markers in the diagnostic approach of critically ill patients. A systematic review of existing literature revealed 31 articles. All six bacteria of interest produce isopentanol, formaldehyde, methyl mercaptan, and trimethylamine. Since humans do not produce these VOCs, they could serve as biological markers for presence of these pathogens. The following volatile biomarkers were found for identification of specific strains: isovaleric acid and 2-methyl-butanal for Staphylococcus aureus; 1-undecene, 2,4-dimethyl-1-heptane, 2-butanone, 4-methyl-quinazoline, hydrogen cyanide, and methyl thiocyanide for Pseudomonas aeruginosa; and methanol, pentanol, ethyl acetate, and indole for Escherichia coli. Notably, several factors that may effect VOC production were not controlled for, including used culture media, bacterial growth phase, and genomic variation within bacterial strains. In conclusion, VOCs produced by bacteria may serve as biological markers for their presence. Goal-targeted studies should be performed to identify potential sets of volatile biological markers and evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of these markers in critically ill patients.
TI  - Etiology and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of bacterial pathogens from urinary tract infection.
AB  - Urinary tract infection (UTI) is the most common infection in both community and  hospital patients. In majority of the cases, empirical antimicrobial treatment is practiced before the laboratory results of urine culture. Thus, antibiotic resistance may increase in urinary bacterial pathogens due to improper use of drugs. This study was designed to find out the etiological agents of UTI and their prevalence, and to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of the bacterial pathogens isolated from urine culture. This study was conducted in Kathmandu Model Hospital, Kathmandu, Nepal from April to October, 2009. Midstream Urine samples from 1323 patients suspected of UTI were analyzed by microscopy, and conventional semi-quantitative culture technique for the significant growth. Antimicrobial susceptibility test was performed for the isolates by Modified Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method. Data were analyzed using SPSS software window version 16. The overall prevalence of UTI was found to be 18.89%. The most frequent causative organisms isolated were Escherichia coli (82.30%), Enterococcus faecalis (5.60%), Citrobacter freundii (3.60%), Enterobacter aerogenes (2.40%), Coagulase Negative Staphylococci (2.40%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1.20%), Proteus mirabilis (0.8%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (0.4%), and Staphylococcus aureus (0.4%). Nitrofurantoin and Amoxycillin were found to be the most effective antibiotic against gram negative and gram positive isolates respectively. E. coli was found to be the most common etiological agent of UTI and Nitrofurantoin was the most effective drug among the isolates.
TI  - Prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of bacteria from milkmen and cows with clinical mastitis in and around Kampala, Uganda.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Identification of pathogens associated with bovine mastitis is helpful in treatment and management decisions. However, such data from sub-Saharan Africa is scarce. Here we describe the distribution and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of bacteria from cows with clinical mastitis in Kampala, Uganda. Due to high concern of zoonotic infections, isolates from milkmen are also described. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Ninety seven milk samples from cows with clinical mastitis and 31 nasal swabs from milkmen were collected (one sample per cow/human). Fifty eight (60%) Gram-positive isolates namely Staphylococci (21), Enterococci (16), Streptococci (13), Lactococci (5), Micrococci (2) and Arcanobacteria (1) were detected in cows; only one grew Staphylococcus aureus. Furthermore, 24 (25%) coliforms namely Escherichia coli (12), Klebsiella oxytoca (5), Proteus vulgaris (2), Serratia (2), Citrobacter (1), Cedecea (1) and Leclercia (1) were identified. From humans, 24 Gram-positive bacteria grew, of which 11 were Staphylococci (35%) including four Staphylococcus aureus. Upon susceptibility testing, methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) were prevalent; 57%, 12/21 in cows and 64%, 7/11 in humans. However, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was not detected. Furthermore, methicillin and vancomycin resistant CoNS were detected in cows (Staphylococcus hominis, Staphylococcus lugdunensis) and humans (Staphylococcus scuiri). Also, vancomycin and daptomycin resistant Enterococci (Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium, respectively) were detected in cows. Coliforms were less resistant with three pan-susceptible isolates. However, multidrug resistant Klebsiella, Proteus, Serratia, Cedecea, and Citrobacter were detected. Lastly, similar species grew from human and bovine samples but on genotyping, the isolates were found to be different. Interestingly, human and bovine Staphylococcus aureus were genetically similar (spa-CC435, spa-type t645 corresponding to ST121) but with different susceptibility patterns. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: CoNS, Enterococci, Streptococci, and Escherichia coli are the predominant pathogens associated with clinical bovine-mastitis in Kampala, Uganda. Multidrug resistant bacteria are also prevalent. While similar species occurred in humans and cows, transmission was not detected.
TI  - Assessment of pathogenic bacteria in treated graywater and irrigated soils.
AB  - Reuse of graywater (GW) for irrigation is recognized as a sustainable solution for water conservation. One major impediment for reuse of GW is the possible presence of pathogenic microorganisms. The presence and abundance of six pathogens and indicators were investigated in three GW recirculating vertical flow constructed wetland treatment systems and their respective irrigated yard soils. The treated GW and soils were monitored once every two months for six months using real-time quantitative PCR. As a control, samples from four soils irrigated with fresh water (FW) were similarly analyzed for pathogens and indicators. Comparable types of pathogens and fecal indicator bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella enterica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, and Shigella spp., were found in the treated GW, their corresponding irrigated soils and the FW-irrigated soils. Moreover, the abundance of these bacteria in the GW- and FW-irrigated soils was of the same order of magnitude, suggesting that the source of the pathogens cannot be established. Our results suggest that GW irrigation has no effect on the diversity and abundance of the tested pathogens and indicators in yard soils.
TI  - Evaluation of pharmacological activities, cytotoxicity and phenolic composition of four Maytenus species used in southern African traditional medicine to treat intestinal infections and diarrhoeal diseases.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Microbial infections and resulting inflammation and oxidative stress  are common pathogenesis of gastrointestinal tract (GIT) disorders. In South Africa, several species of the genus Maytenus are used in traditional medicine to treat various infectious diseases. Most of the previous work on this genus was focused on nonpolar extracts from the root and bark. In this study, leaf extracts of polar extracts of Maytenus peduncularis, Maytenus procumbens, Maytenus senegalensis and Maytenus undata were evaluated for antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities to determine their efficacy as therapeutic agents in GIT disorders. METHODS: Phenolic-enriched leaf extracts and fractions were prepared by extracting with acidified 70% methanol and solvent-solvent fractionation. The activities of the fractions against Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis as well as clinical isolates of Aspergillus fumigatus, Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans were determined using a serial microplate dilution method. Antioxidant activities were determined using 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 2,2'-azinobis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS), hydroxyl (OH) radical scavenging and linoleic acid peroxidation inhibitory assays. The phenolic composition as well as the cytotoxicity against Vero cell lines of the crude extracts was evaluated using various standard protocols. RESULTS: The antimicrobial activities were concentrated in the non-polar fractions of hexane, dichloromethane and ethyl acetate (MICs 19-312 mug/ml). The crude extracts and polar fractions (butanol and water) had moderate to poor antimicrobial activity (MICs 312 to above 2500 mug/ml). The crude extracts and polar fractions had good antioxidant activity (EC50 values varied from 1.22 to 607 mug/ml, 1.71 to 312 mug/ml and 23 to 284 mug/ml for DPPH, ABTS and OH respectively. Linoleic acid peroxidation inhibition EC50 values of the crude extracts ranged between 27 and 39 mug/ml with relatively low toxicity against Vero cell lines (IC50 values 87 to 187 mug/ml). Fractionation of a crude extract with low activity could lead to fractions with more potent activity. CONCLUSION: This study justifies the traditional use of leaf crude extracts and fractions from these four plants to remedy gastrointestinal disorders resulting from infection, inflammation and oxidative stress complications. The study also provides rationale for the use of leaf extracts with same beneficial effects in place of unsustainable root and bark harvest.
TI  - Fate of pathogenic bacteria in microcosms mimicking human body sites.
AB  - During the infectious process, pathogens may reach anatomical sites where they are exposed to substances interfering with their growth. These substances can include molecules produced by the host, and his resident microbial population, as well as exogenous antibacterial drugs. Suboptimal concentrations of inhibitory molecules and stress conditions found in vivo (high or low temperatures, lack of oxygen, extreme pH) might induce in bacteria the activation of survival mechanisms blocking their division capability but allowing them to stay alive. These "dormant" bacteria can be reactivated in particular circumstances and would be able to express their virulence traits. In this study, it was evaluated the effect of some environmental conditions, such as optimal and suboptimal temperatures, direct light and antibiotic sub-inhibitory concentrations doses of antibiotic, on the human pathogens Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis when incubated in fluids accumulated in the body of patients with different pathologies. It is shown that inoculation in a number of accumulated body fluids and the presence of gentamicin, reliable conditions encountered during pathological states, induce stress-responding strategies enabling bacteria to persist in microcosms mimicking the human body. Significant differences were detected in Gram-negative and Gram-positive species with E. faecalis surviving, as starved or viable but non-culturable forms, in any microcosm and condition tested and E. coli activating a viable but non-culturable state only in some clinical samples. The persistence of bacteria under these conditions, being non-culturable, might explain some recurrent infections without isolation of the causative agent after application of the standard microbiological methods.
TI  - Hospital basins used to administer chlorhexidine baths are unlikely microbial reservoirs.
AB  
TI  - Bloodstream infections in patients with or without cancer in a large community hospital.
AB  - PURPOSE: Cancer is associated with an increased risk of acquiring bloodstream infection (BSIs). Most knowledge on pathogens and outcome are derived from specialised cancer centres. We here sought to compare causative micro-organisms in BSIs in patients with or without cancer in a 600-bed teaching community hospital. METHODS: We analysed all positive blood cultures from adult patients between January 2005 and January 2011. RESULTS: A total of 4,918 episodes of BSI occurred in 2,891 patients, of whom 13.4% had a diagnosis of cancer (85.5% with a solid tumour). In both patient groups, Gram-positive isolates were more prevalent (58.7 and 61.4% in patients with and without cancer, respectively) than Gram-negative isolates (31.8 and 32.3%, respectively). Amongst Gram-positive organisms, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Staphylococcus aureus and enterococci were the most frequently isolated in both patient groups; in cancer patients, twice as many BSIs were caused by Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium. Amongst Gram-negative organisms, Escherichia coli was the most common isolate; in cancer patients, twice as many BSIs were caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter cloacae. Yeasts were grown from 3.0% of blood cultures from cancer patients compared to 1.5% of cultures from non-cancer patients. Cancer patients had a 90-day mortality of 35.8% following BSI compared to 23.5% in patients without cancer. CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate distinct BSI pathogens and impaired outcomes in patients with cancer in the setting of a large community teaching hospital.
TI  - Nationwide surveillance of bacterial pathogens from patients with acute uncomplicated cystitis conducted by the Japanese surveillance committee during 2009 and 2010: antimicrobial susceptibility of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus saprophyticus.
AB  - The Japanese surveillance committee conducted the first nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of uropathogens responsible for female acute uncomplicated cystitis at 43 hospitals throughout Japan from April 2009 to November 2010. In this study, the causative bacteria (Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus saprophyticus) and their susceptibility to various antimicrobial agents were investigated by isolation and culturing of bacteria from urine samples. In total, 387 strains were isolated from 461 patients, including E. coli (n = 301, 77.8 %), S. saprophyticus (n = 20, 5.2 %), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 13, 3.4 %), and Enterococcus faecalis (n = 11, 2.8 %). S. saprophyticus was significantly more common in premenopausal women (P = 0.00095). The minimum inhibitory concentrations of 19 antibacterial agents used for these strains were determined according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute manual. At least 87 % of E. coli isolates showed susceptibility to fluoroquinolones and cephalosporins, and 100 % of S. saprophyticus isolates showed susceptibility to fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides. The proportions of fluoroquinolone-resistant E. coli strains and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing E. coli strains were 13.3 % and 4.7 %, respectively. It is important to confirm the susceptibility of causative bacteria for optimal antimicrobial therapy, and empiric antimicrobial agents should be selected by considering patient characteristics and other factors. However, the number of isolates of fluoroquinolone-resistant or ESBL-producing strains in gram-negative bacilli may be increasing in patients with urinary tract infections (UTIs) in Japan. Therefore, these data present important information for the proper treatment of UTIs and will serve as a useful reference for future surveillance studies.
TI  - Identification of pathogens in mastitis milk samples with fluorescent in situ hybridization.
AB  - Traditionally, the bacteriological examination of mastitis milk samples is performed by culture followed by biochemical tests on the cultured bacteria to allow identification of the causative pathogen. Depending on the species involved, this classic identification is time-consuming compared to other techniques such as fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), a culture-independent method that utilizes oligonucleotides (labeled with a fluorophore) that are specific to a string of target DNA/RNA. In the current study, the applicability of FISH was evaluated for the detection of mastitis pathogens directly in milk samples. To remove interfering lipids and proteins from mastitis milk samples prior to FISH, a previously published enzymatic treatment with savinase was evaluated. FISH was performed using oligonucleotides specific for Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus uberis, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, and Trueperella (Arcanobacterium) pyogenes. The enzymatic pretreatment and the sensitivity of FISH were evaluated using spiked whole milk samples and mastitis milk samples with bacterial loads of less than 10(3) up to 10(8) colony-forming units (CFU)/ml. Bacteria were reliably detected in milk samples with bacterial numbers of 10(6) CFU/ml or higher. However, bacteria present in numbers below 10(6) CFU/ml were not detectable in all cases. The ability of FISH to identify mastitis-causing pathogens directly in milk samples, and therefore earlier than classical culture methods, can supplement the classic diagnostic procedures for mastitis milk samples.
TI  - Antibacterial resistance and trend of urinary tract pathogens to commonly used antibiotics in Kashmir Valley.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Increase in resistance pattern of urinary tract pathogens to conventional antimicrobial agents used for urinary tract infections (UTIs) is gaining the attention of many microbiologists worldwide in respect to treatment of UTIs. The aim of the present study was to obtain data on resistance patterns of pathogens responsible for UTIs to currently used antimicrobial agents in Sher-I-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences (tertiary healthcare hospital). METHOD: A total of 2842 samples were collected from both outpatient and inpatient departments. The majority of samples in this study were midstream urine specimens, others included catheterized urine samples. Standard parameters were followed for isolation and identification of clinical isolates and further antimicrobial susceptibility test was done by Kirby Bauer disk diffusion method. RESULTS: Out of 2842 samples, 1980 (67%) were culture positive. Escherichia coli (E coli) was the most prevalent isolate (OP 63%, IP 45.5%) followed by Klebsiella pneumonia (K pneumonia) as the second commonest UTI-causing agent (OP 15.9%, IP 21.7%). High percentage of isolates showed resistance to sulfa drugs such as cotrimoxazole. First generation cephalosporins were ineffective, while aminoglycosides and third generation cephalosporins were effective against E coli, K pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P aeruginosa), Enterococcus faecalis and Staphyococcus aureus (Staph aureus). Furthermore, this study noticed that glycopeptide drugs such as vancomycin are highly effective against E faecalis and Staph aureus UTIs. CONCLUSION: This study reveals the increased trend in resistance pattern of uropathogens in the valley region. These data may aid health professionals in choosing the appropriate treatment for patients with UTI in the region and hopefully will prevent the misuse of antibiotics.
TI  - Surveillance of multidrug resistant uropathogenic bacteria in hospitalized patients in Indian.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To record surveillance, antibiotic resistance of uropathogens of hospitalized patients over a period of 18 months. METHODS: Urine samples from wards and cabins were used for isolating urinary tract infection (UTI)-causing bacteria that were cultured on suitable selective media and identified by biochemical tests; and their antibiograms were ascertained by Kirby-Bauer's disc diffusion method, in each 6-month interval of the study period, using 18 antibiotics of five different classes. RESULTS: From wards and cabins, 1 245 samples were collected, from which 996 strains of bacteria belonging to 11 species were isolated, during April 2011 to September 2012. Two Gram-positive, Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis), and nine Gram-negative bacteria, Acinetobacter baumannii, Citrobacter sp., Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were isolated. Both S. aureus and E. faecalis were vancomycin resistant, and resistant-strains of all pathogens increased in each 6-month period of study. Particularly, all Gram-negatives were resistant to nitrofurantoin and co-trimoxazole, the most preferred antibiotics of empiric therapy for UTI. CONCLUSIONS: Antibiograms of 11 UTI-causing bacteria recorded in this study indicated moderately higher numbers of strains resistant to each antibiotic studied, generating the fear of precipitating fervent episodes in public health particularly with bacteria, Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and S. aureus. Moreover, vancomycin resistance in strains of S. aureus and E. faecalis is a matter of concern.
TI  - Screening for polyphenols, antioxidant and antimicrobial activitiesof extracts from eleven Helianthemum taxa (Cistaceae) used in folk medicine in south-eastern Spain.
AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: The Helianthemum genus contains approximately one hundred taxa. Some of them are important medicinal plants used in several countries for many different purposes. However, studies addressing the phytochemistry of many of these species or their biological activities are currently nonexistent. AIM OF THE STUDY: To perform a comparative analysis of the qualitative composition of secondary metabolites and biological activities of the leaves of the most commonly distributed and used Spanish Helianthemum taxa in order to find a relationship between chemotype, biological activity and uses. MATERIALS AND METHODS: water and 80% methanolic extracts derived from 11 different Helianthemum taxa were analyzed for their phytochemical composition using standard methods. Furthermore, HPLC analysis was performed for the estimation of gallic acid, ellagic acid, tannins and flavonols as marker compounds. The antioxidant activity was measured by employing the scavenging activity on DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) and ABTS (2,2'-azinobis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonate) radicals. The 80% methanolic extracts were evaluated for antibacterial (Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis and Listeria monocytogenes and Gram-negative Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica) activity using the micro dilution technique. RESULTS: The total polyphenolic content and antioxidant capabilities differed significantly among the Helianthemum leaf extracts. A strong correlation between total phenolic content, antioxidant properties and antimicrobial activity was found. The polyphenolic profile was specific for each taxon. Whereas Helianthemum alypoides, Helianthemum cinereum subsp. rotundifolium, Helianthemum hirtum, Helianthemum asperum, and Helianthemum marifolium subsp. marifolium were characterized by the presence of gallic acid, egallic derivatives and ellagitannins; the polyphenolic profile of Helianthemum apenninum subsp. cavanillesianum, Helianthemum syriacum and Helianthemum polygonoides was mostly based on flavonoids. Helianthemum cinereum, Helianthemum alypoides and Helianthemum marifolium consistently presented the strongest radical scavenging activity (in water extracts EC50 ranges from 29.88 to 38.1 against DPPH and from 8.11 to 20.8 against ABTS, and in 80% MeOH extracts from 25.3 to 31.8 against DPPH and from 6.15 to 8.6 against ABTS), total phenol content (>117mg GAE/l) and antimicrobial activities. CONCLUSION: The Helianthemum taxa used in folk medicine did not cluster in a unique section, being equally distributed in two out of the four sections analysed. There was not a clear relationship between the chemotype, based on the polyphenolic composition of the taxa, and their taxonomical classification. However, the composition of the methanolic and water extracts from the leaves of plants belonging to the Helianthemum genus was strongly related to their medicinal uses.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of pleurocidin is retained in Plc-2, a C-terminal 12-amino acid fragment.
AB  - An analysis of a series of five peptides composed of various portions of the pleurocidin (Plc) sequence identified a l2-amino acid fragment from the C-terminus of Plc, designated Plc-2, as the smallest fragment that retained a antimicrobial activity comparable to that of the parent compound. MIC tests in vitro with low-ionic-strength medium showed that Plc-2 has potent activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus but not against Enterococcus faecalis. The antifungal activity of the synthetic peptides against phytopathogenic fungi, such as Fusarium oxysporum, Colletotrichum sp., Aspergillus niger and Alternaria sp., also identified Plc-2 as a biologically active peptide. Microscopy studies of fluorescently stained fungi treated with Plc-2 demonstrated that cytoplasmic and nuclear membranes were compromised in all strains of phytopathogenic fungi tested. Together, these results identify Plc-2 as a potential antimicrobial agent with similar properties to its parent compound, pleurocidin. In addition, it demonstrated that the KHVGKAALTHYL residues are critical for the antimicrobial activity described for pleurocidin.
TI  - Investigation of chemical compounds, antioxidant and antimicrobial properties of  teucrium arduini L. (lamiaceae).
AB  - In this paper chemical composition of the essential oil (analysed by GC and GC-MS), the content of phenolic compounds (analysed by HPLC), quantity of total phenols and total flavonoids (analysed by UV/Vis spectrophotometer), antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of ethanolic extracts were investigated in endemic Teucrium arduini L. in population of Mt Biokovo (Croatia). The oil was characterized by a high concentration of sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (70.4%) of which beta-caryophyllene (35.2%) and germacrene D (18.7%) being the major compounds. Three phenolic compounds (quercetin, ferulic acid and rosmarinic acid) were identified and quantified in ethanolic extract of T. arduini using HPLC. The results also showed that T. arduini is a source of polyphenolic and other antioxidants with radical-scavenging and chelating properties. The ethanol extracts prepared from the leaf of T. arduini showed broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity on Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans and Aspergillus brasiliensis, which are susceptible on concentration below or equal to 4.00 mg/mL, whilst Microsporum gypseum was resistant at investigated concentrations.
TI  - [Efficacy and safety of sitafloxacin in patients with urinary tract infections].
AB  - Sitafloxacin (STFX, Gracevit 50mg, fine granules 10%), a new quinolone antibacterial agent, was approved in January 2008, and the use-results survey was carried out over the 2 years between December 2008 and November 2010. We studied the efficacy and safety of STFX in 1,452 patients with urinary tract infections (cystitis, pyelonephritis, urethritis). The total efficacy rate for urinary tract infections was 91.4% (1,235/1,351 patients). Efficacy rates, classified by the type of infection, were: uncomplicated cystitis 95.9% (466/486 patients), complicated cystitis 87.2% (511/586 patients), uncomplicated pyelonephritis 96.1% (49/51 patients), complicated pyelonephritis 93.5% (145/155 patients), and urethritis 87.7% (64/73 patients). Efficacy rates were 86.0% (49/57 patients) for non-responders to cephems and 77.4% (48/62 patients) for non-responders to quinolones. The eradication rate of indicated strains was 90.5% (545/602 strains). The eradication rates of major causative bacteria were; Escherichia coli 92.7% (294/317 isolates), Enterococcus faecalis 86.0% (43/50 isolates), Pseudomonas aeruginosa 66.7% (16/24 isolates), Klebsiella pneumoniae 95.2% (20/21 isolates), and Chlamydia trachomatis 88.9% (8/9 isolates). The incidence of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) was 2.71% (37/1,365 cases). Major ADRs were diarrhoea (0.88%, 12 cases) and hepatic function disorders (0.51%, 7 cases). A serious ADR (hepatic function abnormality) was observed in 1 case, and the hepatic function in this patient returned to normal after treatment with STFX was discontinued. In conclusion, these results suggest that STFX is a useful antibacterial agent with an efficacy rate of 91.4% against urinary tract infections, with a minimum efficacy rate of 87.2% (against complicated cystitis), and has no serious problems in its safety profile.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria collected from countries in Eastern Europe: results from the Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (T.E.S.T.) 2004-2010.
AB  - The Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (T.E.S.T.) commenced in 2004 to longitudinally monitor global changes in bacterial susceptibility to a suite of antimicrobial agents. The current study examined the activity of tigecycline and comparators against isolates collected across Eastern Europe between 2004 and 2010. Minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined using Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) broth microdilution methodologies. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined using CLSI interpretive criteria, and tigecycline susceptibility was established using European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) breakpoints. This study included 10 295 Gram-negative and 4611 Gram-positive isolates from 42 centres. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) were reported among 15.3% of Escherichia coli and 39.3% of Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates; the highest rates were observed in Turkey (30.9%) and Bulgaria (53.8%), respectively. Imipenem-non-susceptible K. pneumoniae were identified only in Turkey. ESBL-positive E. coli were highly susceptible to imipenem (95.1%), meropenem (98.0%) and tigecycline (98.5%). Most antimicrobials showed poor activity against Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Vancomycin resistance was noted among 0.9% of Enterococcus faecalis and 11.7% of Enterococcus faecium isolates. High rates of susceptibility were reported for linezolid (99.7%) and tigecycline (100%) against E. faecium. One-quarter of Staphylococcus aureus isolates were meticillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), with the highest rate in Romania (51.5%); all MRSA were susceptible to linezolid, tigecycline and vancomycin. Antimicrobial resistance is high in much of Eastern Europe, with considerable variation seen among countries. Tigecycline and the carbapenems retain excellent activity against many pathogens from Eastern Europe; linezolid and vancomycin are active against most Gram-positive pathogens.
TI  - Bioreduction of sheep carcasses effectively contains and reduces pathogen levels  under operational and simulated breakdown conditions.
AB  - Options for the storage and disposal of animal carcasses are extremely limited in the EU after the introduction of the EU Animal By-products Regulations (ABPR; EC/1774/2002), leading to animosity within the livestock sector and the call for alternative methods to be validated. Novel storage technologies such as bioreduction may be approved under the ABPR provided that they can be shown to prevent pathogen proliferation. We studied the survival of Enterococcus faecalis, Salmonella spp., E. coli O157 and porcine parvovirus in bioreduction vessels containing sheep carcasses for approximately 4 months. The vessels were operated under two different scenarios: (A) where the water within was aerated and heated to 40 degrees C, and (B) with no aeration or heating, to simulate vessel failure. Microbial analysis verified that pathogens were contained within the bioreduction vessel and indeed reduced in numbers with time under both scenarios. This study shows that bioreduction can provide an effective and safe on-farm storage system for livestock carcasses prior to ultimate disposal. The findings support a review of the current regulatory framework so that bioreduction is considered for approval for industry use within the EU.
TI  - Detection of antibiotic resistant enterococci and Escherichia coli in free range  Iberian Lynx (Lynx pardinus).
AB  - Thirty fecal samples from wild specimens of Iberian lynx were collected and analyzed for Enterococcus spp. (27 isolates) and Escherichia coli (18 isolates) recovery. The 45 isolates obtained were tested for antimicrobial resistance, molecular mechanisms of resistance, and presence of virulence genes. Among the enterococci, Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus hirae were the most prevalent species (11 isolates each), followed by Enterococcus faecalis (5 isolates). High percentages of resistance to tetracycline and erythromycin (33% and 30%, respectively) were detected among enterococcal isolates. The tet(M) and/or tet(L), erm(B), aac(6')-Ie-aph(2'')-Ia, ant(6)-Ia, or aph(3')-IIIa genes were detected among resistant enterococci. Virulence genes were detected in one E. faecalis isolate (cpd, cylB, and cylL) and one E. hirae isolate (cylL). High percentages of resistance were detected in E. coli isolates to tetracycline (33%), streptomycin (28%), nalidixic acid (28%), and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (SXT, 22%). Additionally, the blaTEM, tet(A), aadA, cmlA, and different combinations of sul genes were detected among most ampicillin, tetracycline, streptomycin, chloramphenicol and SXT-resistant isolates, respectively. Two isolates contained a class 1 integron with the gene cassette arrays dfrA1 + aadA1 and dfrA12 + aadA2. The E. coli isolates were ascribed to phylo-groups A (n=5); B1 (n=4); B2 (n=6), and D (n=3), with the virulence gene fimA present in all E. coli isolates. This study found resistance genes in wild specimens of Iberian lynx. Thus, it is important to notice that multiresistant bacteria have reached species as rare and completely non-synanthropic as the Iberian lynx. Furthermore, the susceptibility of this endangered species to bacterial infection may be affected by the presence of these virulence and resistance genes.
TI  - In situ synthesis and antibacterial activity of copper nanoparticle loaded natural montmorillonite clay based on contact inhibition and ion release.
AB  - Copper nanoparticle based clay composite has been synthesized by in situ reduction of a copper ammonium complex ion and characterized by different analytical instruments. The copper nanoparticles were both intercalated and adsorbed on the surface with diameters of <5nm (for intercalated) and 25-30nm (for adsorbed). The composite showed good stability for over 3 months in air. Excellent antimicrobial activity of the composite was observed on Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus faecalis with mortality rates >90% after 12h. Cellular membrane damage permeated by direct attachment of the composite and indirect damage caused by released copper ion are the primary sources of antibacterial action. Cytotoxicity measurements showed minimal adverse effect on the two human cell lines beyond the M.B.C. value for the microorganisms studied. In the present form the clay composite shows good promise for use in therapeutic applications.
TI  - Pyelonephritis: what are the present day causative organisms and antibiotic susceptibilities?
AB  - AIM: Infections of the lower urinary tract and acute pyelonephritis are commonly  encountered in clinical practice. Widespread usage of antibiotics and changing susceptibility profiles of uropathogens requires regular review of treatment guidelines to meet these challenges. We aimed to better understand the prevalence of uropathogens and emerging antibiotic resistance in patients with pyelonephritis requiring hospital admission. METHODS: In this single centre, 12-year retrospective observational study, we reviewed case notes and urine culture results of 249 patients admitted with acute pyelonephritis under the care of the nephrology department, along with 46,660 urine samples with positive isolates from the emergency department (ED) during the same period. The prevalence of uropathogens, their antibiotic susceptibilities and emerging resistance patterns to commonly used antibiotics were studied. Antibiotic susceptibilities were also reviewed in line with the currently recommended national guidelines for empiric therapy. RESULTS: We found the most prevalent uropathogen to be Escherichia coli. Approximately 50% of E. coli infections were resistant to ampicillin. First and third generation cephalosporin resistance was <5%, however, the latter has increased over the last decade and is more prevalent in the elderly. Enterococcus faecalis was associated with less than 10% of cases of lower urinary tract infections and no case of pyelonephritis. CONCLUSION: Antibiotic resistance of uropathogens to commonly used antibiotics is increasing with time and there is a need for hospitals to review their recommended guidelines for empiric therapy in line with local patterns of uropathogens and antibiotic susceptibilities.
TI  - Design, synthesis and antimicrobial activity of novel benzothiazole analogs.
AB  - In an attempt to design and synthesize a new class of antimicrobials, dialkyne substituted 2-aminobenzothiazole was reacted with various substituted aryl azides to generate a small library of 20 compounds (3a-t) by click chemistry. Structures of the newly synthesized compounds were established on the basis of spectral data. These compounds were screened for their antibacterial activity against Gram+ bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis), Gram- bacteria (Salmonella typhi, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Shigella boydii) and antifungal activity against Candida tropicalis, Candida albicans, Candida krusei, Cryptococcus neoformans) as well as molds (Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus fumigatus). The compound 3e showed maximum potency against all Gram+/gram- bacterial strains with MIC value 3.12 mug/ml, which is two fold more active as compared to standard drug ciprofloxacin (MIC 6.25 mug/ml). However, all compounds were found ineffective against S. boydii (clinical isolate). Further, only one compound 3n was found to be the most active against all fungal strains with MIC value in the range of 1.56 mug/ml-12.5 mug/ml while the remaining compounds showed moderate to weak antifungal activity.
TI  - Synthesis and biological evaluation of new 2-azetidinones with sulfonamide structures.
AB  - New series of N-(arylidene)hydrazinoacetyl sulfonamides 4a1-6, 4b1-6 and N-(4-aryl-3-chloro-2-oxoazetidin-1-yl)aminoacetyl sulfonamides 5a1-6, 5b1-6 were synthesized. The structures of the new derivatives was confirmed using spectral methods (FT-IR, 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR). The antibacterial activities of these compounds against Gram positive (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6583, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 25912) and Gram negative (Klebsiella pneumoniae CIP 53153, Proteus vulgaris CIP 104989, Citrobacter freundii CIP 5732, Enterobacter cloacae CIP 103475, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa CIP 82118) bacterial strains were evaluated using the broth micro-dilution method. Compound 4a2 displayed the highest antibacterial activity, especially against Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The antioxidant potential of the synthesized compounds was also investigated according to ferric reducing power, total antioxidant activity and DPPH radical scavenging assays. All tested compounds showed excellent antioxidant activity in comparison with sulfadiazine and sulfisoxazole which were used as parent sulfonamides. Moreover, some of them showed an antioxidant activity comparable with that of ascorbic acid. In general, the compounds designed based on a sulfadiazine skeleton (compounds 4a1-6, 5a1-6) are more active than those obtained from sulfisoxazole (compounds 4b1-6, 5b1-6), and the N-(arylidene)hydrazinoacetyl sulfonamide derivatives 4a1-6, 4b1-6 are more active than their azetidionone analogues 5a1-6, 5b1-6.
TI  - Effect of Zingiber officinale and propolis on microorganisms and endotoxins in root canals.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of glycolic propolis  (PRO) and ginger (GIN) extracts, calcium hydroxide (CH), chlorhexidine (CLX) gel and their combinations as ICMs (ICMs) against Candida albicans, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli and endotoxins in root canals. MATERIAL AND METHODS: After 28 days of contamination with microorganisms, the canals were instrumented and then divided according to the ICM: CH+saline; CLX, CH+CLX, PRO, PRO+CH; GIN; GIN+CH; saline. The antimicrobial activity and quantification of endotoxins by the chromogenic test of Limulus amebocyte lysate were evaluated after contamination and instrumentation at 14 days of ICM application and 7 days after ICM removal. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: After analysis of results and application of the Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn statistical tests at 5% significance level, it was concluded that all ICMs were able to eliminate the microorganisms in the root canals and reduce their amount of endotoxins; however, CH was more effective in neutralizing endotoxins and less effective against C. albicans and E. faecalis, requiring the use of medication combinations to obtain higher success.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance of Enterococcus species from meat and fermented meat products isolated by a PCR-based rapid screening method.
AB  - Enterococci are predominantly found in the gastrointestinal tract of humans and animals, but species commonly resident on vegetation are known. Their presence in large numbers in foods may indicate a lapse in sanitation and their ability to serve as a genetic reservoir of transferable antibiotic resistance is of concern. Conventional culture methods for identification of enterococci are slow and sometimes give false results because of the biochemical diversity of the organisms in this genus. This work reports the development of a PCR-based assay to detect enterococci at the genus level by targeting a 16S rRNA sequence. Published 16S rRNA sequences were aligned and used to design genus specific primers (EntF and EntR). The primers were able to amplify a 678 bp target region from Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 7080 and 20 other strains of enterococci from 11 different species, but there was no amplification by 32 species from closely related genera (Pediococcus, Lactobacillus, Streptococcus and Listeria) or species of Escherichia coli and Salmonella. The PCR positive samples were plated, screened by a colony patch technique and their identities were confirmed by API 20 Strep panels and sequencing. When dry fermented sausage and ham as well as fresh meat batter for dry cured sausage manufacture were tested for enterococci by the method, 29 Enterococcus strains (15 E. faecalis, 13 E. faecium, and one E. gallinarum) were identified. When susceptibility of these enterococci to 12 antibiotics was tested, the highest incidence of resistance was to clindamycin (89.6%), followed by tetracycline hydrochloride (65.5%), tylosin (62%), erythromycin (45%), streptomycin and neomycin (17%), chloramphenicol (10.3%), penicillin (10.3%), ciprofloxacin (10.3%) and gentamicin (3.4%). None was resistant to the clinically important drugs vancomycin or ampicillin. Most strains (27/29) were resistant to more than one antibiotic while 17 of 29 strains were resistant to three to 8 antibiotics. The molecular method developed was validated for speciation of enterococci and was useful in assessing uncooked processed meat products as a reservoir for multi-drug resistant Enterococcus species.
TI  - The effects of bee pollen extracts on the broiler chicken's gastrointestinal microflora.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of bee pollen ethanolic extracts on the in vivo gastrointestinal tract microflora colonization of broiler chickens. A completely randomized experiment based on six treatments (different concentrations of bee pollen - 0, 5, 15, 25, 35 and 45 g kg(-1) diet) was used during 7 weeks. The highest count of faecal Enterococci was found in the experimental group with the addition of 15 g of pollen (8.85 +/- 0.87 log CFU g(-1)) per 1 kg of feed mixture. The highest count of Lactobacilli was detected in the experimental group with 35 g of pollen per 1 kg of feed mixture and the highest number of the Enterobacteriaceae genera count was found in the control group (8.43 +/- 0.15 log CFU g(-1)). Moreover, the MALDI TOF MS Biotyper identified the following genera: Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella oxytoca, as well as Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. crispatus, L. fermentum and L. salivarius from the Lactobacilli group and Enterococcus avium, E. casseliflavus, E. cecorum, E. faecalis, E. faecium, E. gallinarum, E. hirae and E. malodoratus from the Enterococci group. Additionally, the in vitro antimicrobial activities of pollen against five bacteria species isolated from gastrointestinal tracts of chickens were tested. The best antimicrobial effect of the pollen extract was detected against K. oxytoca.
TI  - CD137 expressed on neutrophils plays dual roles in antibacterial responses against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial infections.
AB  - Severe sepsis and septic shock caused mainly by bacterial infections are life-threatening conditions that urge the development of novel therapies. However, host responses to and pathophysiology of sepsis have not been clearly understood, which remains a major obstacle for the development of effective therapeutics. Recently, we have shown that stimulation of a costimulatory molecule, CD137, enhanced survival of mice infected with the Gram-positive (G(+)) intracellular bacterium Listeria monocytogenes but decreased survival in a polymicrobial sepsis model. Herein, we report that CD137 deficiency or blocking of CD137 signaling decreased antibacterial responses of mice infected with G(+) bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Enterococcus faecalis) but increased these responses in mice infected with Gram-negative (G(-)) bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium). Consistent with these findings, stimulation of CD137 by administration of agonistic antibody enhanced responses against G(+) bacteria, whereas it decreased these responses against G(-) bacteria. Neutrophils were responsible for CD137-mediated opposite roles in control of G(+) and G(-) bacterial infections. Stimulation of CD137 enhanced activities of neutrophils against S. aureus but decreased these activities against E. coli, while CD137 blocking produced opposite results with the stimulation of CD137 in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, we found that combined signaling of CD137 and Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) induced synergistic production of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) by neutrophils, but combined signaling of CD137 and TLR4 did not. Our data strongly suggest that CD137 may play a dual role in sepsis in association with TLRs.
TI  - In vitro assessment of functional properties of lactic acid bacteria isolated from faecal microbiota of healthy dogs for potential use as probiotics.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria were isolated and identified in the faeces of Chinese Crested and Yorkshire terrier pups and their probiotic features were investigated in vitro. Thirty seven isolates were identified as Lactobacillus or Enterococcus. Out of these isolates, 31 were lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and belonged to the species Lactobacillus reuteri (16/37; 43.3%), Lactobacillus animalis (7/37; 18.9%), Lactobacillus acidophilus (3/37; 8.1%), Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis (2/37; 5.4%), Lactobacillus murinus (2/37; 5.4%), and Lactobacillus paraplantarum (1/37; 2.7%), while six other LAB isolates were Enterococcus spp. (6/37; 16.2%). Strains were tested for resistance to gastric acidity (pH 2.5 for 3 h) and bile salts (0.3% ox gall), cell surface hydrophobicity by microbial adhesion to solvents, antagonism against pathogenic bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and Listeria monocytogenes), production of hydrogen peroxide, and antibiotic susceptibility. Thirty four strains were highly resistant to acidic conditions with slight (18 strains) to moderate (16 strains) growth inhibition by bile salts. Seven isolates had highly hydrophobic cellular surfaces and 28 strains exhibited strong antagonism against the bacterial pathogens tested, although 8 isolates tested against Leptospira interrogans had no effect on pathogen growth. All isolates produced low rates of hydrogen peroxide. Based on these results, two Lactobacillus strains showed promising probiotic-related features and merit investigation as probiotics for dogs.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity and hydrophobicity of edible whey protein isolate films formulated with nisin and/or glucose oxidase.
AB  - The use of edible antimicrobial films has been reported as a means to improve food shelf life through gradual releasing of antimicrobial compounds on the food surface. This work reports the study on the incorporation of 2 antimicrobial agents, nisin (N), and/or glucose oxidase (GO), into the matrix of Whey protein isolate (WPI) films at pH 5.5 and 8.5. The antimicrobial activity of the edible films was evaluated against Listeria innocua (ATCC 33090), Brochothrix thermosphacta (NCIB10018), Escherichia coli (JMP101), and Enterococcus faecalis (MXVK22). In addition, the antimicrobial activity was related to the hydrophobicity and water solubility of the WPI films. The greatest antibacterial activity was observed in WPI films containing only GO. The combined addition of N and GO resulted in films with lower antimicrobial activity than films with N or GO alone. In most cases, a pH effect was observed as greater antimicrobial response at pH 5.5 as well as higher film matrix hydrophobicity. WPI films supplemented with GO can be used in coating systems suitable for food preservation.
TI  - New water-soluble polypyridine silver(I) derivatives of 1,3,5-triaza-7-phosphaadamantane (PTA) with significant antimicrobial and antiproliferative activities.
AB  - The new series of silver(I) coordination polymers [Ag(N-N)(mu-PTA)]n(X)n (1, 2, 4-8, 10, 11) and discrete monomers [Ag(N-N)(PTA)2](X) (3, 9) {N-N = bpy (1-3), dtbpy (4), neocup (5, 6), phen (7-9), dione (10, 11); X = NO3 (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10), PF6 (2, 4, 6, 8, 11)} were generated by self-assembly reactions, in MeOH at ~25 degrees C, of AgNO3 or AgPF6 with 1,3,5-triaza-7-phosphaadamantane (PTA) and the corresponding polypyridines, namely 2,2'-bipyridine (bpy), 4,4'-di-tert-butyl-2,2'-bipyridine (dtbpy), 1,10-phenanthroline (phen), 2,9-dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroline (neocup) and 1,10-phenanthroline-5,6-dione (dione). The compounds were obtained as air and light stable solids and characterized by IR, (1)H and (31)P{(1)H} NMR spectroscopy, ESI(+)-MS and elemental analyses. The crystal structure of 1 was determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis, revealing infinite one-dimensional (1D) linear chains driven by mu-PTA N,P-linkers. Apart from representing the first examples of the metal-PTA derivatives bearing polypyridine ligands, 1-11 also feature solubility in water (S(25 degrees C) approximately 4-18 mg mL(-1)). Selected compounds (1, 3, 5, 7, 9 and 10) were thus tested for their biological properties and found to exhibit significant antibacterial and antifungal activities, screened in vitro against the standard strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus sanguinis, Staphylococcus mutans, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Candida albicans. Furthermore, the compounds 5, 7, 9 and 10 show a pronounced antiproliferative activity against human malignant melanoma (A375), and the effects on the inhibition of tumor cells in vitro are in agreement with the DNA-binding studies.
TI  - Broad-spectrum antibacterial activity of carbon nanotubes to human gut bacteria.
AB  - Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) hold promise in manufacturing, environmental, and biomedical applications, as well as food and agricultural industries. Previous observations have shown that CNTs have antimicrobial activity; however, the impact of CNTs to human gut microbes has not been investigated. Here, the antibacterial activity of CNTs against the microbes commonly encountered in the human digestion system--L. acidophilus, B. adolescentis, E. coli, E. faecalis, and S. aureus--are evaluated. The bacteria studied include pathogenic and non-pathogenic, gram-positive and negative, and both sphere and rod strains. In this study, CNTs, including single-walled CNTs (SWCNTs, 1-3 mum), short and long multi-walled CNTs (s-MWCNTs: 0.5-2 mum; l-MWCNTs: >50 mum), and functionalized multi-walled CNTs (hydroxyl- and carboxyl-modification, 0.5-2 mum), all have broad-spectrum antibacterial effects. Notably, CNTs may selectively lyse the walls and membranes of human gut microbes, depending on not only the length and surface functional groups of CNTs, but also the shapes of the bacteria. The mechanism of antibacterial activity is associated with their diameter-dependent piercing and length-dependent wrapping on the lysis of microbial walls and membranes, inducing release of intracellular components DNA and RNA and allowing a loss of bacterial membrane potential, demonstrating complete destruction of bacteria. Thin and rigid SWCNT show more effective wall/membrane piercing on spherical bacteria than MWCNTs. Long MWCNT may wrap around gut bacteria, increasing the area making contact with the bacterial wall. This work suggests that CNTs may be broad-spectrum and efficient antibacterial agents in the gut, and selective application of CNTs could reduce the potential hazard to probiotic bacteria.
TI  - Undecaprenyl pyrophosphate phosphatase confers low-level resistance to bacitracin in Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Undecaprenyl pyrophosphate phosphatases (UppPs) have been implicated  in bacitracin resistance in some bacterial genera and the aim of this study was to determine the role of UppPs in mediating low-level bacitracin resistance in Enterococcus faecalis. METHODS: The uppP gene was identified in the genomes of laboratory (JH2-2) and clinical (V583) strains of E. faecalis. Gene fusions (uppP-lacZ) and 5'-RACE were used to study uppP expression. The uppP gene in both strains was inactivated and mutants were studied for antimicrobial susceptibility and their susceptibilities to various stress agents. RESULTS: The UppP protein from E. faecalis showed high sequence identity to the Escherichia coli BacA-type UppP and was predicted to be a hydrophobic protein with eight transmembrane helices. The expression of uppP-lacZ was constitutive and not affected by bacitracin or cell wall-active antimicrobials. E. faecalis uppP mutants showed no significant changes in growth rate, colony morphology and biofilm formation. The uppP mutants exhibited increased susceptibility to bacitracin (MICs=3-6 mg/L) relative to the isogenic wild-type (MICs=32-48 mg/L). When uppP was expressed in a wild-type background, the MIC of bacitracin increased to 128->/=256 mg/L. The MICs of cefoxitin, teicoplanin, vancomycin, gentamicin, enrofloxacin and d-cycloserine were unaltered in the uppP mutant relative to the wild-type, as were susceptibilities to other stress agents (glycine, lysozyme, NaCl, SDS, low and high pH, oxidative stress and ethanol). CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate that low-level bacitracin resistance in E. faecalis is mediated by a BacA-type UppP.
TI  - In vitro biological effects of two anti-diabetic medicinal plants used in Benin as folk medicine.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Extracts from Polygonum senegalensis (Polygonaceae) and Pseudocedrela kotschyi (Meliaceae) are two important traditionally used medicinal plants in rural Benin to treat many diseases and notably type 2 diabetes. The aim of the study was to investigate the alpha-glucosidase inhibition, antioxidant and antibacterial activities of those plants extract: Polygonum senegalensis leaves, and Pseudocedrela kotschyi root. METHODS: Hydro-alcoholic (50%) extracts were analyzed for their phytochemical content and tested for their inhibition potency on alpha-glucosidase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Antioxidant activities were assessed using the DPPH, ORAC, FRAP and DCFH-DA (cell based) assay. Finally, the antibacterial activity was evaluated using MIC determination on four Gram-positive cocci (Bacillus subtilis, Clostridium difficile, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus), three Gram-negative bacilli (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae), and the yeast Candida albicans. RESULTS: Each extract presented significant alpha-glucosidase inhibition and antioxidant activities. Polygonum senegalensis leaf extracts were the most active in each in vitro assay with an IC50 = 1.5 mug/ml for alpha-glucosidase inhibition and an IC50 = 6.8 mug/ml for DPPH scavenging, - 4.5 mumol Fe II/g of dry matter - 9366 mumol Trolox / g DW - for FRAP and ORAC values, respectively. IC50 = 2.3 mug GA / ml for DCFH-DA assay. Concerning its antibacterial activity, a growth inhibitory effect was observed only against three Gram negative bacilli: B. subtilis, E. faecalis, S. aureus and the yeast C. albicans at high concentration. CONCLUSION: The results showed that the semi alcoholic extract of the two studied plants possess alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activity, antioxidant potency, and low antibacterial effect.
TI  - [Microbial and pharmacological characteristics of VancogenX].
AB  - PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: Prosthetic joint infection is a feared complication in total hip arthroplasty. The use of antibiotic-impregnated bone cement is the important part of preventive and therapeutic strategies. At present a number of commercial bone cements are available and support of their use by the results of experimental trials and clinical studies has varied. In relation to this issue we studied essential microbiological and pharmacological characteristics of VancogenX in comparison with gentamicin-loaded bone cement used conventionally. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Based on a previously described protocol, we tested pellets of four commercial bone cements, namely, Hi-Fatigue G, Palacos R+G, VancogenX, and Palacos R as a control. Bone cement was prepared in a vacuum-mixing system. The strains used for bacterial load included Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli. Each cement was tested for its antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities and the results were evaluated by standard methods. In addition, we investigated time-related release of gentamicin and vancomycin from the bone cements tested. RESULTS: All antibiotic-loaded cement pellets were able to prevent growth of the bacterial strains tested. The bactericidal effect lasted for several days in relation to the bacterial species and cement used, with the exception of S. epidermidis whose growth was inhibited by gentamicin-loaded cement only for one day. The antibiotic-loaded pellets also prevented the formation of a biofilm for 24 hours at least. The major amount of vancomycin (32.915 mg/l) was released from VancogenX to MH medium within 24 hours and the last measureable amount (4.327 mg/l) was recorded at 48 hours after the start of the experiment. In physiological saline the highest level of vancomycin was 139.852 mg/ml measured at 24 hours, and the antibiotic was detectable at a level of 2.334 mg/ml as late as 8 days after the experiment started. Release of gentamicin from VancogenX was as follows: the 24-hour level was higher in MH medium than physiological saline (178 versus 131.4 mg/ml); however, gentamicin was still detectable in physiological saline at 192 hours after the start of the experiment while no gentamicin was found in MH medium after 72 hours. DISCUSSION: The antimicrobial effect of VancogenX bone cement was not an unexpected finding since both gentamicin and vancomycin have been used with bone cement for a long time and their combination is optimal in terms of preventing prosthetic joint infection. However, there is a disputable issue of poor release of vancomycin from bone cement. In MH medium we were able to detect the vancomycin released from VancogenX only for two days after the initial rapid elution while its release into physiological saline seemed to be slower but much longer. It is possible that more vancomycin is released from bone cement, but this amount is immediately bound to proteins in the cement vicinity and this process is not detectable by any analytical method. CONCLUSIONS: The bone cement VancogenX showed excellent antimicrobial and antibiofilm properties and can be recommended for use in orthopaedic practice. Therapy of prosthetic joint infection is the main indication. Extension of the indication to the prevention of prosthetic joint infection in high-risk patients should be preceded by biomechanical studies demonstrating that the cement is appropriate for long-term implant fixation.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of essential oils from Mediterranean aromatic plants against several foodborne and spoilage bacteria.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of essential oils extracted from a variety of aromatic plants, often used in the Portuguese gastronomy was studied in vitro by the agar diffusion method. The essential oils of thyme, oregano, rosemary, verbena, basil, peppermint, pennyroyal and mint were tested against Gram-positive (Listeria monocytogenes, Clostridium perfringens, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus epidermidis) and Gram-negative strains (Salmonella enterica, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). For most essential oils examined, S. aureus, was the most susceptible bacteria, while P. aeruginosa showed, in general, least susceptibility. Among the eight essential oils evaluated, thyme, oregano and pennyroyal oils showed the greatest antimicrobial activity, followed by rosemary, peppermint and verbena, while basil and mint showed the weakest antimicrobial activity. Most of the essential oils considered in this study exhibited a significant inhibitory effect. Thyme oil showed a promising inhibitory activity even at low concentration, thus revealing its potential as a natural preservative in food products against several causal agents of foodborne diseases and food spoilage. In general, the results demonstrate that, besides flavoring the food, the use of aromatic herbs in gastronomy can also contribute to a bacteriostatic effect against pathogens.
TI  - Bactericidal Activity of Methanol Extracts of Crabapple Mangrove Tree (Sonneratia caseolaris Linn.) Against Multi-Drug Resistant Pathogens.
AB  - The crabapple mangrove tree, Sonneratia caseolaris Linn. (Family: Sonneratiaceae), is one of the foreshore plants found in estuarine and tidal creek areas and mangrove forests. Bark and fruit extracts from this plant have previously been shown to have an anti-oxidative or cytotoxic effect, whereas flower extracts of this plant exhibited an antimicrobial activity against some bacteria. According to the traditional folklore, it is medicinally used as an astringent and antiseptic. Hence, this investigation was carried out on the extract of the leaves, pneumatophore and different parts of the flower or fruit (stamen, calyx, meat of fruit, persistent calyx of fruit and seeds) for antibacterial activity using the broth microdilution method. The antibacterial activity was evaluated against five antibiotic-sensitive species (three Gram-positive and two Gram-negative bacteria) and six drug-resistant species (Gram-positive i.e. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium and Gram-negative i.e. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-Escherichia coli, multidrug-resistant-Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acenetobacter baumannii). The methanol extracts from all tested parts of the crabapple mangrove tree exhibited antibacterial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, but was mainly a bactericidal against the Gram-negative bacteria, including the multidrug-resistant strains, when compared with only bacteriostatic on the Gram-positive bacteria. Using Soxhlet apparatus, the extracts obtained by sequential extraction with hexane, dichloromethane and ethyl acetate revealed no discernable antibacterial activity and only slightly, if at all, reduced the antibacterial activity of the subsequently obtained methanol extract. Therefore, the active antibacterial compounds of the crabapple mangrove tree should have a rather polar structure.
TI  - Biochemical and genetic characterization of the Enterococcus faecalis oxaloacetate decarboxylase complex.
AB  - Enterococcus faecalis encodes a biotin-dependent oxaloacetate decarboxylase (OAD), which is constituted by four subunits: E. faecalis carboxyltransferase subunit OadA (termed Ef-A), membrane pump Ef-B, biotin acceptor protein Ef-D, and the novel subunit Ef-H. Our results show that in E. faecalis, subunits Ef-A, Ef-D, and Ef-H form a cytoplasmic soluble complex (termed Ef-AHD) which is also associated with the membrane. In order to characterize the role of the novel Ef-H subunit, coexpression of oad genes was performed in Escherichia coli, showing that this subunit is vital for Ef-A and Ef-D interaction. Diminished growth of the oadA and oadD single deletion mutants in citrate-supplemented medium indicated that the activity of the complex is essential for citrate utilization. Remarkably, the oadB-deficient strain was still capable of growing to wild-type levels but with a delay during the citrate-consuming phase, suggesting that the soluble Ef-AHD complex is functional in E. faecalis. These results suggest that the Ef-AHD complex is active in its soluble form, and that it is capable of interacting in a dynamic way with the membrane-bound Ef-B subunit to achieve its maximal alkalinization capacity during citrate fermentation.
TI  - Infectious risk assessment of unsafe handling practices and management of clinical solid waste.
AB  - The present study was undertaken to determine the bacterial agents present in various clinical solid wastes, general waste and clinical sharp waste. The waste was collected from different wards/units in a healthcare facility in Penang Island, Malaysia. The presence of bacterial agents in clinical and general waste was determined using the conventional bacteria identification methods. Several pathogenic bacteria including opportunistic bacterial agent such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella spp., Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes were detected in clinical solid wastes. The presence of specific pathogenic bacterial strains in clinical sharp waste was determined using 16s rDNA analysis. In this study, several nosocomial pathogenic bacteria strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Lysinibacillus sphaericus, Serratia marcescens, and Staphylococcus aureus were detected in clinical sharp waste. The present study suggests that waste generated from healthcare facilities should be sterilized at the point of generation in order to eliminate nosocomial infections from the general waste or either of the clinical wastes.
TI  - Photoelectrocatalytic disinfection of water and wastewater: performance evaluation by qPCR and culture techniques.
AB  - Photoelectrocatalytic oxidation (PEC) was evaluated as a disinfection technique using water and secondary treated wastewater spiked with Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis. PEC experiments were carried out using a TiO(2)/Ti-film anode and a zirconium cathode under simulated solar radiation. Bacterial inactivation was monitored by culture and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Inactivation rates were enhanced when the duration of the treatment was prolonged and when the bacterial density and the complexity of the water matrix were decreased. E. coli cells were reduced by approximately 6 orders of magnitude after 15 min of PEC treatment in water at 2V of applied potential and an initial concentration of 10(7) CFU/mL; pure photocatalysis (PC) led to about 5 log reduction, while electrochemical oxidation alone resulted in negligible inactivation. The superiority of PEC relative to PC can be attributed to a more efficient separation of the photogenerated charge carriers. Regarding disinfection in mixed bacterial suspensions, E. coli was more susceptible than E. faecalis at a potential of 2V. The complex composition of wastewater affected disinfection efficiency, yielding lower inactivation rates compared to water treatment. qPCR yielded lower inactivation rates at longer treatment times than culture techniques, presumably due to the fact that the latter do not take into account the viable but not culturable state of microorganisms.
TI  - Preparation of Some Eco-friendly Corrosion Inhibitors Having Antibacterial Activity from Sea Food Waste.
AB  - Chitosan is one of the important biopolymers and it is extracted from exoskeletons of crustaceans in sea food waste. It is a suitable eco-friendly carbon steel corrosion inhibitor in acid media; the deacetylation degree of prepared chitosan is more than 85.16 %, and the molecular weight average is 109 kDa. Chitosan was modified to 2-N,N-diethylbenzene ammonium chloride N-oxoethyl chitosan (compound I), and 12-ammonium chloride N-oxododecan chitosan (compound II) as soluble water derivatives. The corrosion inhibition efficiency for carbon steel of compound (I) in 1 M HCl at varying temperature is higher than for chitosan and compound (II). However, the antibacterial activity of chitosan for Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Candida albicans is higher than for its derivatives, and the minimum inhibition concentration and minimum bacterial concentration of chitosan and its derivatives were carried out with the same strain.
TI  - Echinoderms from Azores islands: an unexpected source of antibiotic resistant Enterococcus spp. and Escherichia coli isolates.
AB  - The prevalence of antibiotic resistance and the implicated mechanisms of resistance were evaluated in Enterococcus spp. and Escherichia coli, isolated from a total of 250 faecal samples of echinoderms collected from Azorean waters (Portugal). A total of 144 enterococci (120 Enterococcus faecium, 14 E. hirae, 8 E. faecalis, 2 E. gallinarum) and 10 E. coli were recovered. High percentages of resistance in enterococci were found for erythromycin, ampicillin, tetracyclin and ciprofloxacin. The erm(A) or erm(B), tet(M) and/or tet(L), vat(D), aac(6')-aph(2'') and aph(3')-IIIa genes were found in isolates resistant to erythromycin, tetracycline, quinupristin/dalfopristin, high-level gentamicin and high-level kanamycin, respectively. Resistance in E. coli isolates was detected for streptomycin, amikacin, tetracycline and tobramycin. The aadA gene was found in streptomycin-resistant isolates and tet(A)+tet(B) genes in tetracycline-resistant isolates. The data recovered are essential to improve knowledge about the dissemination of resistant strains through marine ecosystems and the possible implications involved in transferring these resistances either to other animals or to humans.
TI  - Biological approach to synthesize TiO2 nanoparticles using Aeromonas hydrophila and its antibacterial activity.
AB  - Nanosized materials have been an important subject in basic and applied sciences. A novel, low-cost, green and reproducible bacteria, Aeromonas hydrophila mediated biosynthesis of titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2 NPs) was reported. The resulting nanoparticles were characterized by FTIR, XRD, AFM and FESEM with EDX. FTIR showed characteristic bands (1643 and 3430 cm(-1)) finds the role of carboxyl group OH stretching amine NH stretch in the formation of TiO2 NPs. The XRD spectrum confirmed that the synthesized TiO2 NPs were in the form of nanocrystals, as evidenced by the peaks at 2theta values of 27.47 degrees , 31.77 degrees , 36.11 degrees , 41.25 degrees , 54.39 degrees , 56.64 degrees and 69.54 degrees were identified as 110, 100, 101, 111, 211, 220 and 301 reflections, respectively. The crystallite sizes were calculated using Scherrer's formula applied to the major intense peaks and found to be the size of 40.50 nm. The morphological characterization was analyzed by FESEM and the analysis showed the NPs smooth shaped, spherical and uneven. GC-MS analysis showed the main compounds found in A. hydrophila were uric acid (2.95%), glycyl-L-glutamic acid (6.90%), glycyl-L-proline (74.41%) and L-Leucyl-D-leucine (15.74%). The potential glycyl-L-proline could have played an important role as a capping agent. A possible mechanism for the biosynthesis of TiO2 NPs has been proposed. The antibacterial activity of the synthesized TiO2 NPs was assessed by well diffusion method toward A. hydrophila, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes and Enterococcus faecalis and showed effective inhibitory activity against S. aureus (33 mm) and S. pyogenes (31 mm).
TI  - Microbiological survey of imported produce available at retail across Canada.
AB  - Increasing consumption and year-round consumer demand for fresh, minimally processed green vegetables have been observed in Canada and other developed countries. However, in the past two decades, produce has been increasingly implicated in outbreaks and correspondingly recognized as a vector for the transmission of pathogenic microorganisms. To this end, we examined the microbiological quality of imported produce available at retail across Canada during a period of limited domestic availability. In total, 106 samples obtained from five Canadian cities were purchased from retail outlets and subjected to microbiological analyses, including aerobic plate (APC) and coliform counts, and enrichments for enterococci, indicator Escherichia coli, E. coli O157:H7 and Salmonella spp. Also, recovered Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium were screened for antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Overall, samples included herbs (n=61), leafy greens (n=25), and spinach (n=20) deriving from five countries (Columbia, Dominican Republic, Guatemala, Mexico, and the United States [US]). APCs were consistent across commodities regardless of country, ranging from mean log10 CFU/g of 6.1 to 7.4, with no significant differences observed. Excluding a single leafy green sample from Guatemala, the lowest prevalence of coliforms was for Mexican herbs (22.2%), with a high of 66.7% on US leafy greens. With the exception of spinach, concentrations of coliforms varied widely, ranging from undetectable to too numerous to count (>8.5 log10 CFU/g). Of the commodities assessed, Mexican and US spinach had the lowest coliform concentrations (undetectable to 4.0 log10 CFU/g). Organic herbs and conventional leafy greens possessed significantly lower (p<0.05) prevalence of coliforms compared to conventional herbs and organic leafy greens, respectively. The most frequent recovery of indicator E. coli was observed for herbs, with 11.1, 8.3, and 3.7% prevalence observed in samples from Columbia, US, and Mexico, respectively. For spinach, 0 and 6.7% of Mexican and US samples tested positive, while no leafy green samples from either country were positive. No E. coli O157:H7 or Salmonella spp. were detected. E. faecium and E. faecalis were recovered from 15.1 and 5.7% of samples, respectively. Although no glycopeptide resistance was observed, resistance to other clinically relevant antibiotics was noteworthy in both species. Overall, though microbiological quality indicators were frequently high, E. coli O157:H7 and Salmonella were not detected. However, the presence of resistance and reduced susceptibility to clinically relevant antimicrobials in recovered enterococci demonstrate imported fresh produce may serve as a vehicle for the transmission of antimicrobial resistance across national borders.
TI  - Ochnaflavone and ochnaflavone 7-O-methyl ether two antibacterial biflavonoids from Ochna pretoriensis (Ochnaceae).
AB  - The acetone extract of Ochna pretoriensis was evaluated for antibacterial activity using bioautography and serial microplate dilution methods against four nosocomial bacterial pathogens namely: Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. A bioassay-guided fractionation of the crude extract led to the isolation of two antibacterial biflavonoids, ochnaflavone and ochnaflavone 7-O-methyl ether. Gram-negative bacteria were more sensitive to the isolated compounds than the Gram-positive bacteria (MIC values: 31.3 microg/mL for P. aeruginosa and 62.5 microg/mL for S. aureus). In addition, the isolated compounds were assessed for their potential toxic effects in the MTT toxicity assay using monkey kidney vero cells and Ames genotoxicity test using Salmonella typhimurium strain TA98. LC50 values were 125.9 microg/mL for ochnaflavone and 162.0/microg/mL for ochnaflavone 7-O-methyl ether. The isolated compounds have selectivity index values ranging from 1.29 to 4.03. Selectivity index values higher than one indicate that test samples are less toxic to the host cells than to the pathogens. The biflavonoids did not have any mutagenic effects in the Salmonella/microsome assay without metabolic activation.
TI  - Inactivation of Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli present in treated urban wastewater by coagulation-flocculation and photo-Fenton processes.
AB  - The purpose of the current study is to evaluate the inactivation of three different kinds of bacteria usually present in municipal wastewater treatment effluents (Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli) using a coagulation-flocculation-decantation (CFD) process combined with photo-Fenton treatment at pH 5. Different concentrations of Fe(3+)-H2O2 (0.4/25, 5/25 and 15/25 mg L(-1)), and H2O2 (25 mg L(-1)) were evaluated for 210 minutes under artificial solar irradiation in a solar chamber ATLAS SUNTEST CPS+. The results were compared applying the CFD process before or after the disinfection treatment. The results of the bacteria inactivation show that the highest rate was observed using CFD-photo-Fenton treatment with 15 mg L(-1) of Fe(3+) and 25 mg L(-1) of H2O2, obtaining the total inactivation of Pseudomonas sp., a 5.64-log inactivation of Enterococcus sp. and a 4.61-log inactivation of E. coli. In addition, turbidity and suspended solids decreased more than 90% with the combined treatments. The treated wastewater samples could be reused in urban, agricultural, industrial, recreational and environmental uses according to current Spanish legislation (RD 1620/2007).
TI  - Effects of antibiotics on bacterial species composition and metabolic activities  in chemostats containing defined populations of human gut microorganisms.
AB  - The composition and metabolic activities of the human colonic microbiota are modulated by a number of external factors, including diet and antibiotic therapy. Changes in the structure and metabolism of the gut microbiota may have long-term consequences for host health. The large intestine harbors a complex microbial ecosystem comprising several hundreds of different bacterial species, which complicates investigations on intestinal physiology and ecology. To facilitate such studies, a highly simplified microbiota consisting of 14 anaerobic and facultatively anaerobic organisms (Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides vulgatus, Bifidobacterium longum, Bifidobacterium infantis, Bifidobacterium pseudolongum, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Clostridium butyricum, C. perfringens, C. bifermentans, C. innocuum, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus acidophilus) was used in this investigation. Ampicillin [9.2 mug (ml culture)(-1)] was added to two chemostats operated at different dilution rates (D; 0.10 h(-1) and 0.21 h(-1)), and metronidazole [76.9 mug (ml culture)(-1)] was added to a third vessel (D = 0.21 h(-1)). Perturbations in bacterial physiology and metabolism were sampled over a 48-h period. Lactobacillus acidophilus and C. bifermentans populations did not establish in the fermentors under the imposed growth conditions. Ampicillin resulted in substantial reductions in bacteroides and C. perfringens populations at both dilution rates. Metronidazole strongly affected bacteroides communities but had no effect on bifidobacterial communities. The bacteriostatic effect of ampicillin on bifidobacterial species was growth rate dependent. Several metabolic activities were affected by antibiotic addition, including fermentation product formation and enzyme synthesis. The growth of antibiotic-resistant bifidobacteria in the large bowel may enable them to occupy ecological niches left vacant after antibiotic administration, preventing colonization by pathogenic species.
TI  - Formation of haloacetonitriles and haloacetamides during chlorination of pure culture bacteria.
AB  - The increasing reuse of organic nitrogen-rich wastewater raises concerns regarding the formation of nitrogenous disinfection by-products (N-DBPs), such as haloacetonitriles and haloacetamides. Previous research mainly focused on N-DBPs formation from dissolved organic matter in wastewater. In this study, dichloroacetonitrile (DCAN) and dichloroacetamide (DCAcAm) formation from particles in the secondary effluents of a domestic wastewater treatment plant during chlorination was assessed to account for 26-46% of the total formation. As part of particles in wastewater, bacterial cells enriched in organic nitrogen are considered a potential source for the formation of N-DBPs during chlorination. The formation of DCAN, DCAcAm and trichloroacetamide (TCAcAm) during the chlorination of a Gram-negative bacterium of Escherichia coli (E. coli) and a Gram-positive bacterium of Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis) were then evaluated. Compared with dissolved organic matter in the secondary effluent, bacterial cells formed more DCAN, DCAcAm and TCAcAm during chlorination. E. faecalis formed more DCAN, but less DCAcAm and TCAcAm than E. coli did under most chlorination conditions. Moreover, the effects of contact time, chlorine dose, pH value and ammonia nitrogen concentration on the N-DBPs formation from the two bacterial suspensions were investigated. Under the chlorination conditions in this study, DCAN formation from the bacterial suspensions initially increased and then decreased, while TCAcAm formation increased with increasing contact time and chlorine dose. DCAcAm formation from the bacterial suspensions increased with the prolonged contact time, and increased and then decreased with increasing chlorine dose. DCAN, DCAcAm and TCAcAm formation was favored under neutral pH condition, but was reduced with the addition of ammonia during the chlorination of the two bacterial suspensions.
TI  - Cold denaturation of a protein dimer monitored at atomic resolution.
AB  - Protein folding and unfolding are crucial for a range of biological phenomena and human diseases. Defining the structural properties of the involved transient species is therefore of prime interest. Using a combination of cold denaturation with NMR spectroscopy, we reveal detailed insight into the unfolding of the homodimeric repressor protein CylR2. Seven three-dimensional structures of CylR2 at temperatures from 25 degrees C to -16 degrees C reveal a progressive dissociation of the dimeric protein into a native-like monomeric intermediate followed by transition into a highly dynamic, partially folded state. The core of the partially folded state seems critical for biological function and misfolding.
TI  - Comparative in vitro inhibition of urinary tract pathogens by single- and multi-strain probiotics.
AB  - PURPOSE: Multi-species probiotic preparations have been suggested as having a wide spectrum of application, although few studies have compared their efficacy with that of individual component strains at equal concentrations. We therefore tested the ability of 4 single probiotics and 4 probiotic mixtures to inhibit the urinary tract pathogens Escherichia coli NCTC 9001 and Enterococcus faecalis NCTC 00775. METHODS: We used an agar spot test to test the ability of viable cells to inhibit pathogens, while a broth inhibition assay was used to assess inhibition by cell-free probiotic supernatants in both pH-neutralised and non-neutralised forms. RESULTS: In the agar spot test, all probiotic treatments showed inhibition, L. acidophilus was the most inhibitory single strain against E. faecalis, L. fermentum the most inhibitory against E. coli. A commercially available mixture of 14 strains (Bio-Kult((R))) was the most effective mixture, against E. faecalis, the 3-lactobacillus mixture the most inhibitory against E. coli. Mixtures were not significantly more inhibitory than single strains. In the broth inhibition assays, all probiotic supernatants inhibited both pathogens when pH was not controlled, with only 2 treatments causing inhibition at a neutral pH. CONCLUSIONS: Both viable cells of probiotics and supernatants of probiotic cultures were able to inhibit growth of two urinary tract pathogens. Probiotic mixtures prevented the growth of urinary tract pathogens but were not significantly more inhibitory than single strains. Probiotics appear to produce metabolites that are inhibitory towards urinary tract pathogens. Probiotics display potential to reduce the incidence of urinary tract infections via inhibition of colonisation.
TI  - Effectiveness of flexible gastrointestinal endoscope reprocessing.
AB  - The practice of reprocessing endoscopes and its effectiveness was evaluated in 37 services. Contamination of at least 1 endoscope could be identified in 34 (91.6%) of 37 services. Bacteria, fungi, and/or mycobacteria were isolated from 84.6% (33/39) of the colonoscopes (110-32,000 colony-forming units [CFUs]/mL) and from 80.6% (50/62) of the gastroscopes (100-33,000 CFUs/mL). Not all services followed recommended guidelines. Therefore, patients who underwent gastrointestinal endoscopies were exposed to diverse pathogens.
TI  - Effect of Ottoman Viper (Montivipera xanthina (Gray, 1849)) Venom on Various Cancer Cells and on Microorganisms.
AB  - Cytotoxic and antimicrobial effects of Montivipera xanthina venom against LNCaP,  MCF-7, HT-29, Saos-2, Hep3B, Vero cells and antimicrobial activity against selected bacterial and fungal species: Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, E. coli O157H7, Enterococcus faecalis 29212, Enterococcus faecium DSM 13590, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, S. typhimirium CCM 5445, Proteus vulgaris ATCC 6957 and Candida albicans ATCC 10239 were studied for evaluating the potential medical benefit of this snake venom. Cytotoxicity of venom was determined using MTT assay. Snake venom cytotoxicity was expressed as the venom dose that killed 50 % of the cells (IC50). The antimicrobial activity of venom was studied by minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and disc diffusion assay. MIC was determined using broth dilution method. The estimated IC50 values of venom varied from 3.8 to 12.7 or from 1.9 to 7.2 mug/ml after treatment with crude venom for 24 or 48 h for LNCaP, MCF-7, HT-29 and Saos-2 cells. There was no observable cytotoxic effect on Hep3B and Vero cells. Venom exhibited the most potent activity against C. albicans (MIC, 7.8 mug/ml and minimal fungicidal concentration, 62.5 mug/ml) and S. aureus (MIC, 31.25 mug/ml). This study is the first report showing the potential of M. xanthina venom as an alternative therapeutic approach due to its cytotoxic and antimicrobial effects.
TI  - Bacteriocin PJ4 active against enteric pathogen produced by Lactobacillus helveticus PJ4 isolated from gut microflora of wistar rat (Rattus norvegicus): partial purification and characterization of bacteriocin.
AB  - The increase of multidrug-resistant pathogens and the restriction on the use antibiotics due to its side effects have drawn attention to the search for possible alternatives. Bacteriocins are small antimicrobial peptides produced by numerous bacteria. Much interest has been focused on bacteriocins because they exhibit inhibitory activity against pathogens. Lactic acid bacteria possess the ability to synthesize antimicrobial compounds (like bacteriocin) during their growth. In this study, an antibacterial substance (bacteriocin PJ4) produced by Lactobacillus helveticus PJ4, isolated from rat gut microflora, was identified as bacteriocin. It was effective against wide assay of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria involved in various diseases, including Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus aureus. The antimicrobial peptide was relatively heat-resistant and also active over a wide pH range of 2-10. It has been partially purified to homogeneity using ammonium sulfate precipitation and size exclusion chromatography and checked on reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of bacteriocin PJ4 purified through size exclusion chromatography resolved ~6.5 kDa protein with bacteriocin activity. The peptide is inactivated by proteolytic enzymes, trypsin, and lipase but not when treated with catalase, alpha-amylase, and pepsin. It showed a bactericidal mode of action against the indicator strains E. coli MTCC443, Lactobacillus casei MTCC1423, and E. faecalis DT48. Such characteristics indicate that this bacteriocin may be a potential candidate for alternative agents to control important pathogens.
TI  - Evidence for bacteria-independent hatching of Trichuris muris eggs.
AB  - Hatching of infective larvae from embryonated eggs in the intestine is an essential first step in Trichuris infections. There are three isolates of the murine parasitic nematode Trichuris muris: E, E-J (the E isolate maintained in Japan), and S. Incubation of T. muris embryonated eggs with the intestinal bacteria Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus induced in vitro hatching of the eggs, but Enterococcus faecalis failed to induce hatching. Bacteria-induced in vitro hatching of embryonated eggs occurred in the E and E-J isolates, whereas the S isolate was unresponsive to bacteria. T. muris worms recovered from infected mice showed no significant difference between the E-J and S isolates in their infectivity to susceptible B10.BR mice (P>0.05). In vivo hatching of embryonated eggs occurred at 30 min post-infection in the upper and lower halves of the small intestine of ddY mice infected with the E-J or S isolates, and on average, 65% of embryonated eggs recovered from the upper half of the small intestine were hatched in both the E-J and S isolates. In comparison with Enterococcus, the bacteria E. coli and S. aureus represent relatively minor components of the flora of the upper half of the small intestine of mice. These observations point to the possibility that bacteria-independent hatching might also occur in vivo, at least for the S isolate, and imply the existence of a very different system of induction of hatching in vivo.
TI  - Chimeric beta-defensin analogs, including the novel 3NI analog, display salt-resistant antimicrobial activity and lack toxicity in human epithelial cell lines.
AB  - Human beta-defensins (hBDs) are crucial peptides for the innate immune response and are thus prime candidates as therapeutic agents directed against infective diseases. Based on the properties of wild-type hBD1 and hBD3 and of previously synthesized analogs (1C, 3I, and 3N), we have designed a new analog, 3NI, and investigated its potential as an antimicrobial drug. Specifically, we evaluated the antimicrobial activities of 3NI versus those of hBD1, hBD3, 1C, 3I, and 3N. Our results show that 3NI exerted greater antibacterial activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Enterococcus faecalis than did hBD1 and hBD3, even with elevated salt concentrations. Moreover, its antiviral activity against herpes simplex virus 1 was greater than that of hBD1 and similar to that of hBD3. Subsequently, we investigated the cytotoxic effects of all peptides in three human epithelial carcinoma cell lines: A549 from lung, CaCo-2 from colon, and Capan-1 from pancreas. None of the analogs significantly reduced cell viability versus wild-type hBD1 and hBD3. They did not induce genotoxicity or cause an increase in the number of apoptotic cells. Using confocal microscopy, we also investigated the localization of the peptides during their incubation with epithelial cells and found that they were distributed on the cell surface, from which they were internalized. Finally, we show that hBD1 and hBD3 are characterized by high resistance to serum degradation. In conclusion, the new analog 3NI seems to be a promising anti-infective agent, particularly given its high salt resistance--a feature that is relevant in diseases such as cystic fibrosis.
TI  - Microparticles containing propolis and metronidazole: in vitro characterization,  release study and antimicrobial activity against periodontal pathogens.
AB  - Ethylcellulose microparticles containing metronidazole and propolis extractive solution were prepared and evaluated in vitro against periodontal pathogens. Scanning electron microscopy, particle size analysis, drug entrapment efficiency and drug release of microparticles were determined. The antimicrobial activity of microparticles was evaluated against microorganisms of periodontal importance (Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli). It was obtained particles with regular morphology, mean diameter of 1.23 microm, and entrapment efficiency for propolis and metronidazole were 91.41% and 22.23%, respectively. In vitro release studies of propolis and metronidazole from microparticles showed prolonged drug release and controlled by Fickian diffusion. Both propolis and metronidazole displayed activity against the tested strains. Moreover, the results showed that the strains of E. faecalis, S. pyogenes and S. mutans were more susceptible to the propolis and E. faecalis to the metronidazole. It was also observed that the amount of metronidazole to inhibit the microorganism strains in the physical mixture with propolis was smaller than in the metronidazole alone, suggesting potentiation effect between propolis and metronidazole. These microparticles would be useful for developing intermediary or eventual dosage form to be administered into the periodontal pocket more easily and safely.
TI  - Glucose triggers ATP secretion from bacteria in a growth-phase-dependent manner.
AB  - ATP modulates immune cell functions, and ATP derived from gut commensal bacteria  promotes the differentiation of T helper 17 (Th17) cells in the intestinal lamina propria. We recently reported that Enterococcus gallinarum, isolated from mice and humans, secretes ATP. We have since found and characterized several ATP-secreting bacteria. Of the tested enterococci, Enterococcus mundtii secreted the greatest amount of ATP (>2 muM/10(8) cells) after overnight culture. Glucose, not amino acids and vitamins, was essential for ATP secretion from E. mundtii. Analyses of energy-deprived cells demonstrated that glycolysis is the most important pathway for bacterial ATP secretion. Furthermore, exponential-phase E. mundtii and Enterococcus faecalis cells secrete ATP more efficiently than stationary-phase cells. Other bacteria, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus, also secrete ATP in exponential but not stationary phase. These results suggest that various gut bacteria, including commensals and pathogens, might secrete ATP at any growth phase and modulate immune cell function.
TI  - An in vitro evaluation of antimicrobial efficacy of primary root canal filling materials.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed to evaluate and compare six different materials commonly used for filling the root canals of primary teeth for antimicrobial efficacy against some of the microorganisms commonly found in infected root canals. STUDY DESIGN: In this experimental in vitro study six root canal filling materials were tested for antimicrobial efficacy against eight microbial strains using the agar diffusion method. RESULTS: Zinc oxide eugenol paste exhibited the strongest antimicrobial potential followed by Endoflas, zinc oxide-calcium hydroxide-sodium fluoride mixture, zinc oxide-calcium hydroxide mixture and calcium hydroxide paste (Apexcal). The addition of sodium fluoride to the zinc oxide-calcium hydroxide mixture enhanced the antimicrobial efficacy. Metapex demonstrated minimal inhibition and Vaseline was non-inhibitory. CONCLUSIONS: All the test filling materials demonstrated varying antimicrobial activity against the microorganisms tested. Zinc oxide eugenol paste and materials containing zinc oxide were found to be more effective against the microorganisms compared to materials without zinc oxide.
TI  - Chemical composition and antioxidant/antimicrobial activities in supercritical carbon dioxide fluid extract of Gloiopeltis tenax.
AB  - Gloiopeltis tenax (G. tenax) is widely distributed along the Chinese coastal areas and is commonly used in the treatment of diarrhea and colitis. This study aimed at investigating the bioactivities of the volatile constituents in G. tenax. We extracted the essential constituents of G. tenax by supercritical carbon dioxide extraction (CO(2)-SFE), then identified and analyzed the constituents by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). In total, 30 components were identified in the G. tenax extract. The components showed remarkable antioxidant activity (radical scavenging activity of 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH)), lipid peroxidation inhibition capacity (in a beta-carotene/linoleic acid-coupled oxidation reaction), and hydroxyl radical-scavenging activity (by deoxyribose degradation by iron-dependent hydroxyl radical), compared to butylated hydroxytoluene. In microdilution assays, G. tenax extracts showed a moderate inhibitory effects on Staphyloccocus aureus (minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) = 3.9 mg/mL), Enterococcus faecalis (7.8 mg/mL), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (15.6 mg/mL), and Escherichia coli (3.9 mg/mL). Antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of G. tenax were related to the active chemical composition. These results suggest that the CO(2)-SFE extract from G. tenax has potential to be used as a natural antioxidant and antimicrobial agent in food processing.
TI  - Antimicrobial potential for the combination of bovine lactoferrin or its hydrolysate with lactoferrin-resistant probiotics against foodborne pathogens.
AB  - Previous reports have shown that several probiotic strains can resist the antibacterial activity of bovine lactoferrin (bLf), but the results are inconsistent. Moreover, a portion of orally administered apo-bLf is digested in vivo by pepsin to yield bLf hydrolysate, which produces stronger antibacterial activity than that observed with apo-bLf. However, whether bLf hydrolysate affects the growth of probiotic strains is unclear. Therefore, various probiotic strains in Taiwan were collected and evaluated for activity against apo-bLf and bLf hydrolysate in vitro. Thirteen probiotic strains were evaluated, and the growth of Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356, Lactobacillus salivarius ATCC 11741, Lactobacillus rhamnosus ATCC 53103, Bifidobacterium longum ATCC 15707, and Bifidobacterium lactis BCRC 17394 were inhibited by both apo-bLf and bLf hydrolysate. The growth of 8 strains were not affected by apo-bLf and bLf hydrolysate, including L. rhamnosus ATCC 7469, Lactobacillus reuteri ATCC 23272, Lactobacillus fermentum ATCC 11739, Lactobacillus coryniformis ATCC 25602, L. acidophilus BCRC 14065, Bifidobacterium infantis ATCC 15697, Bifidobacterium bifidum ATCC 29521, and Pediococcus acidilactici ATCC 8081. However, apo-bLf and its hydrolysate inhibited the growth of foodborne pathogens, including Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis. Moreover, the supernatants produced by L. fermentum, B. lactis, and B. longum inhibited the growth of most pathogens. Importantly, a combination of apo-bLf or bLf hydrolysate with the supernatants of cultures of the organisms described above showed synergistic or partially synergistic effects against the growth of most of the selected pathogens. In conclusion, several probiotic strains are resistant to apo-bLf and bLf hydrolysate, warranting clinical studies to evaluate the antimicrobial potential for the combination of apo-bLf or its hydrolysate with specific probiotics.
TI  - [Hospital outbreak of urinary tract infections by lubricant gel contaminated with Burkholderia cepacia].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Burkholderia cepacia (B. cepacia) has been the causal agent of infectious hospital outbreaks. METHODS: a case-controls study was conducted to describe an outbreak of urinary tract infection associated to lubricant-gel contaminated with B. cepacia. Patients who developed UTIsc were included in this study. Their clinical data, urine cultures, antiobiograms and the molecular bacterial analysis were analyzed. RESULTS: the urine culture was positive in 101 (55.8 %); the bacterial strains isolated were: B. cepacia 30.7 %, Escherichia coli 22.7 %, Enterococcus faecalis 9.9 %, Enterococcus spp. 8.9 %. They were 31 patients with B. cepacia isolation that was taken as the cases group and 63 with UTIsc due to another organism as control group. The Charlson comorbidity index was 5.3 +/- 1.8 for cases and 4.5 +/- 1.2 for controls. The factors associated with death were: heart disease, diabetes, pneumonia, bacteremia and UTIsc B. cepacia. CONCLUSIONS: the lubricant gel used for urinary catheter placement originated the outbreak. Heart disease, pneumonia, bacteremia and UTIsc B. cepacia were related to patients' death.
TI  - Comparing effects of freezing at -196 degrees C and -20 degrees C on the viability of mastitis pathogens.
AB  - The aim of this study was to compare the effects of cryopreservation at approximately -196 degrees C in liquid nitrogen (N) and freezing at approximately -20 degrees C in a freezer, on the viability and survival of eight different mastitogenic bacteria inoculated in milk. Bacteria were frozen at approximately -20 degrees C in a freezer and cryopreserved at approximately -196 degrees C in liquid nitrogen. An effective preservation method was needed for follow-up samples from cows identified in the South African National Milk Recording Scheme (NMRS) with somatic cell counts above 250 000 cells/mL milk. The organisation responsible for sample collection of the NMRS milk samples also provides producers with liquid nitrogen for their semen flasks at the collection sites. This existing mode of storage and transport could therefore be utilised.Ten samples of each organism were thawed and cultured bi-weekly until week 18 for both temperature treatments. An additional sampling was performed at week 30 for samples frozen at approximately -20 degrees C. Freezing and cryopreservation did not impair subsequent isolation of Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus uberis, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus (STH) (phage type lytic group III) or Sta. aureus (STA) (phage typed, other than lytic group III). Survival was indicated by the isolation of bacteria from samples, and viability by the strength of growth of the bacteria isolated. The survival of Streptococcus agalactiae decreased after week 12 and Escherichia coli after week 16 of freezing, but both organisms survived under cryogenic preservation until week 18. Coagulase-negative staphylococci survived until week 18 for both freezing and cryogenic preservation.Both storage methods could thus contribute to the improvement of a pro-active approach towards udder health management in South African dairy herds.
TI  - American Journal of Gastroenterology Lecture: Intestinal microbiota and the role  of fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) in treatment of C. difficile infection.
AB  - The vital roles that intestinal flora, now called microbiota, have in maintaining our health are being increasingly appreciated. Starting with birth, exposure to the outside world begins the life-long intimate association our microbiota will have with our diet and environment, and initiates determination of the post-natal structural and functional maturation of the gut. Moreover, vital interactions of the microbiota with our metabolic activities, as well as with the immunological apparatus that constitutes our major defense system against foreign antigens continues throughout life. A perturbed intestinal microbiome has been associated with an increasing number of gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal diseases including Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). It has become recognized that fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) can correct the dysbiosis that characterizes chronic CDI, and effect a seemingly safe, relatively inexpensive, and rapidly effective cure in the vast majority of patients so treated. In addition, FMT has been used to treat an array of other gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal disorders, although experience in these other non-CDI diseases is in its infancy. More work needs to be done with FMT to ensure its safety and optimal route of administration. There is a conceptual sea change that is developing in our view of bacteria from their role only as pathogens to that of being critical to health maintenance in a changing world. Future studies are certain to narrow the spectrum of organisms that need to be given to patients to cure disease. FMT is but the first step in this journey.
TI  - Using rapid diagnostic tests to optimize antimicrobial selection in antimicrobial stewardship programs.
AB  - New advances in rapid diagnostic tests provide several collaborative opportunities for stewardship teams, particularly in processes where delay in the initiation of appropriate therapy has significant consequences for patient outcomes. Rapid molecular tests enhance one of the key functions of microbiology laboratories, which is to produce accurate organism identification and timely antimicrobial susceptibility testing data. These data are used to guide the choice of antimicrobial agents for treating infections in individual patients, and the aggregate data (i.e., hospital's antibiogram) are used to guide empiric therapy for infections before the availability of the patient's culture results and antimicrobial susceptibility testing data. In addition, accurate antimicrobial susceptibility testing data are critical for the overall success of a health care institution's antimicrobial stewardship program. Tests that provide accurate organism identification and antimicrobial susceptibility not only benefit the individual patient but also increase the effectiveness of antimicrobial stewardship programs. This review focuses on the use of molecular diagnostic methods to rapidly identify Staphylococcus species, Enterococcus faecalis,Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli,Klebsiella pneumoniae,Pseudomonas aeruginosa,Clostridium difficile, and Candida species from clinical samples and summarizes studies that describe the application of rapid diagnostic tests in antimicrobial stewardship programs.
TI  - Antibacterial and antimycotic activities of Slovenian honeys.
AB  - In the present study, Slovenian honey samples produced from different floral sources are evaluated for their antibacterial and antifungal properties. The peroxide contribution to antibacterial activity is also determined. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the honeys was assessed against four bacterial species (Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus) and against eight fungal species (Aspergillus niger, Aureobasidium pullulans, Candida albicans, Candida parapsilosis, Candida tropicalis, Cladosporium cladosporioides, Penicillium chrysogenum and Rhodotorula mucilaginosa). Honey at concentrations between 1% and 50% (v/v) were tested. Although all of the bacterial species were inhibited by the different honey samples, the chestnut and pasture honeys showed the highest antibacterial activities. The antifungal activities were concentration-dependent, with five (Aureobasidium pullulans, Candida parapsilosis, Candida tropicalis, Cladosporium cladosporioides, Rhodotorula mucilaginosa) inhibited only at honey concentrations greater than 50%. The fungi Aspergillus niger, Candida albicans and Penicillium chrysogenum were not inhibited by any of the tested honeys, even at the highest concentrations. The lowest MICs seen were 2.5% (v/v) for the chestnut, fir and forest honeys against Staphylococcus aureus, and 10.0% (v/v) for the chestnut and pasture honeys against Cladosporium cladosporioides. The non-peroxide action of chestnut honey was tested against Escherichia coli. The MIC of the catalase-treated chestnut honey was 50% (v/v). The antibacterial effect of Slovenian honeys is mostly due to peroxide action. These data support the concept that Slovenian honeys are effective antibacterials and antifungals, and can thus be applied for medicinal purposes.
TI  - Behavior of Escherichia coli O26:H11 in the presence of Hafnia alvei in a model cheese ecosystem.
AB  - This study was designed to evaluate the capacity of three Hafnia strains to inhibit the growth of an E. coli strain O26:H11 in an uncooked pressed model cheese, in the presence or absence of a microbial consortium added to mimic a cheese microbial community. Inoculated at 2 log CFU/ml into pasteurized milk without Hafnia, the E. coli O26:H11 strain reached 5 log CFU/g during cheese-making and survived at levels of 4 to 5 log CFU/g beyond 40 days. Inoculated into milk at 6 log CFU/ml, all three tested Hafnia strains (H. alvei B16 and HA, H. paralvei 920) reached values close to 8 log CFU/g and reduced E. coli O26:H11 counts in cheese on day 1 by 0.8 to 1.4 log CFU/g compared to cheeses inoculated with E. coli O26:H11 and the microbial consortium only. The Hafnia strains slightly reduced counts of Enterococcus faecalis (~-0.5 log from day 1) and promoted Lactobacillus plantarum growth (+0.2 to 0.5 log from day 8) in cheese. They produced small amounts of putrescine (~1.3 mmol/kg) and cadaverine (~0.9 mmol/kg) in cheese after 28 days, and did not affect levels of volatile aroma compounds. Further work on H. alvei strain B16 showed that E. coli O26:H11, inoculated at 2 log CFU/ml, was inhibited by H. alvei B16 inoculated at 6 log CFU/ml and not at 4.5 log CFU/ml. The inhibition was associated neither with lower pH values in cheese after 6 or 24h, nor with higher concentrations of lactic acid. Enhanced concentrations of acetic acid on day 1 in cheese inoculated with H. alvei B16 (4 to 11 mmol/kg) could not fully explain the reduction in E. coli O26:H11 growth. A synergistic interaction between H. alvei B16 and the microbial consortium, resulting in an additional 0.7-log reduction in E. coli O26:H11 counts, was observed from day 8 in model cheeses made from pasteurized milk. However, E. coli O26:H11 survived better during ripening in model cheeses made from raw milk than in those made from pasteurized milk, but this was not associated with an increase in pH values. In vitro approaches are required to investigate the mechanisms and causative agents of this interaction. H. alvei B16 appears to be a promising strain for reducing E. coli O26:H11 growth in cheese, as part of a multi-hurdle approach.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of novel azaphenothiazine derivatives.
AB  - Antimicrobial activity in vitro of a series of novel azaphenothiazine derivatives containing a quinoline moiety was investigated using Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis) and Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) strains as well as in Candida albicans yeast. The examined compounds showed the highest activity against Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli whereas activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the lowest. Compound 1d demonstrates the highest activity against all tested bacterial strains. Compounds 1c, 1h and 1k with various substituents (CH3, OH, NH2) at C11 position of the quinobenzothiazine ring, did not exhibit activity against any tested bacterial strain. Only compounds 1m and 1n with long aliphatic chains at the quinoline nitrogen atom showed antifungal activity. Correlations between antimicrobial activity and chemical structure of the tested compounds were observed.
TI  - [A model of intestinal infiltrate in conditions of chronic experiment].
AB  - A chronic intestinal infiltrate model, aiming at a typical inflammatory process simulation, was elaborated in experiment. As a result of experiment on 30 rabbits the quantity of colonies of various causative agents was established, which did not cause the abscess and peritonitis formation. While doing the operation in 60 rabbits chronic infiltrate was formed between abducting and adducting small intestine loops, its mesentery and big omentum; between abducting and adducting large intestine loops, its mesentery and big omentum. The infiltrate formation process was studied up on the 3, 7, 14th and 28th day. Dynamics of changes in microorganisms species and quantity were studied, using microbiological investigations data. The stages of chronic intestinal infiltrate formation were followed up, using histological investigations. Application of the method proposed have permitted to form a chronic infiltrate owing predicted course to reduce the experiment duration and the investigated animals quantity.
TI  - Zn(II), Ni(II), Cu(II) and Pb(II) complexes of tridentate asymmetrical Schiff base ligands: synthesis, characterization, properties and biological activity.
AB  - New asymmetrical tridentate Schiff base ligands were synthesized using 1,2-phenylenediamine, 4-methyl-1,2-phenylenediamine, 2-hydroxy-1-napthaldehyde, 9-anthracenecarboxaldehyde. Schiff base ligands and their metal complexes were synthesised and characterized by using FT-IR, (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR, UV-Vis, XRD, ESR, elemental analysis and fluorescence studies. The antimicrobial activity of the ligands and their metal complexes were studied against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213, S. aureus ATCC 25923, Streptococcus mutans RSHM 676, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853. The determination of the antibacterial activity was done using the broth microdilution methods. In general, it has been determined that the studied compounds have MIC values similar to Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. It has been found that Ni, Pb, Zn derivatives of HL1A and ZnL(2)A has lower MIC values than ampicillin for P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 strain.
TI  - Comparison of filters for concentrating microbial indicators and pathogens in lake water samples.
AB  - Bacterial indicators are used to indicate increased health risk from pathogens and to make beach closure and advisory decisions; however, beaches are seldom monitored for the pathogens themselves. Studies of sources and types of pathogens at beaches are needed to improve estimates of swimming-associated health risks. It would be advantageous and cost-effective, especially for studies conducted on a regional scale, to use a method that can simultaneously filter and concentrate all classes of pathogens from the large volumes of water needed to detect pathogens. In seven recovery experiments, stock cultures of viruses and protozoa were seeded into 10-liter lake water samples, and concentrations of naturally occurring bacterial indicators were used to determine recoveries. For the five filtration methods tested, the highest median recoveries were as follows: glass wool for adenovirus (4.7%); NanoCeram for enterovirus (14.5%) and MS2 coliphage (84%); continuous-flow centrifugation (CFC) plus Virocap (CFC+ViroCap) for Escherichia coli (68.3%) and Cryptosporidium (54%); automatic ultrafiltration (UF) for norovirus GII (2.4%); and dead-end UF for Enterococcus faecalis (80.5%), avian influenza virus (0.02%), and Giardia (57%). In evaluating filter performance in terms of both recovery and variability, the automatic UF resulted in the highest recovery while maintaining low variability for all nine microorganisms. The automatic UF was used to demonstrate that filtration can be scaled up to field deployment and the collection of 200-liter lake water samples.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of AH Plus, EndoREZ and Epiphany against microorganisms.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of endodontic sealers against microorganisms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The agar diffusion method was used. A double base layer of Mueller Hinton agar was done. The microorganisms used were: Candida albicans, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. The wells were obtained by removing a standardized portion of the agar. After the distribution of the sealers, Petri plates were incubated for 24 h. Inhibition halos formed around the wells were measured. RESULTS: Epiphany did not show any antimicrobial activity on the tested microorganisms (without inhibition halo). The AH Plus showed the greatest inhibition halo on C. albicans followed by EndoREZ on S. aureus. EndoREZ also showed greater inhibition halo in comparison to AH Plus on E. faecalis and E. coli. CONCLUSION: It could be concluded that AH Plus and EndoREZ showed antimicrobial activity against all the tested microorganisms. No antimicrobial activity was observed for Epiphany.
TI  - Effect of low-dose gaseous ozone on pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Treatment of chronically infected wounds is a challenge, and bacterial environmental contamination is a growing issue in infection control. Ozone may have a role in these situations. The objective of this study was to determine whether a low dose of gaseous ozone/oxygen mixture eliminates pathogenic bacteria cultivated in Petri dishes. METHODS: A pilot study with 6 bacterial strains was made using different concentrations of ozone in an ozone-oxygen mixture to determine a minimally effective dose that completely eliminated bacterial growth. The small and apparently bactericidal gaseous dose of 20 mug/mL ozone/oxygen (1:99) mixture, applied for 5 min under atmospheric pressure was selected. In the 2nd phase, eight bacterial strains with well characterized resistance patterns were evaluated in vitro using agar-blood in adapted Petri dishes (105 bacteria/dish). The cultures were divided into 3 groups: 1--ozone-oxygen gaseous mixture containing 20 mug of O(3)/mL for 5 min; 2--100% oxygen for 5 min; 3--baseline: no gas was used. RESULTS: The selected ozone dose was applied to the following eight strains: Escherichia coli, oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae, carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii, Acinetobacter baumannii susceptible only to carbapenems, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa susceptible to imipenem and meropenem. All isolates were completely inhibited by the ozone-oxygen mixture while growth occurred in the other 2 groups. CONCLUSION: A single topical application by nebulization of a low ozone dose completely inhibited the growth of all potentially pathogenic bacterial strains with known resistance to antimicrobial agents.
TI  - PanG, a new ketopantoate reductase involved in pantothenate synthesis.
AB  - Pantothenate, commonly referred to as vitamin B(5), is an essential molecule in the metabolism of living organisms and forms the core of coenzyme A. Unlike humans, some bacteria and plants are capable of de novo biosynthesis of pantothenate, making this pathway a potential target for drug development. Francisella tularensis subsp. tularensis Schu S4 is a zoonotic bacterial pathogen that is able to synthesize pantothenate but is lacking the known ketopantoate reductase (KPR) genes, panE and ilvC, found in the canonical Escherichia coli pathway. Described herein is a gene encoding a novel KPR, for which we propose the name panG (FTT1388), which is conserved in all sequenced Francisella species and is the sole KPR in Schu S4. Homologs of this KPR are present in other pathogenic bacteria such as Enterococcus faecalis, Coxiella burnetii, and Clostridium difficile. Both the homologous gene from E. faecalis V583 (EF1861) and E. coli panE functionally complemented Francisella novicida lacking any KPR. Furthermore, panG from F. novicida can complement an E. coli KPR double mutant. A Schu S4 DeltapanG strain is a pantothenate auxotroph and was genetically and chemically complemented with panG in trans or with the addition of pantolactone. There was no virulence defect in the Schu S4 DeltapanG strain compared to the wild type in a mouse model of pneumonic tularemia. In summary, we characterized the pantothenate pathway in Francisella novicida and F. tularensis and identified an unknown and previously uncharacterized KPR that can convert 2-dehydropantoate to pantoate, PanG.
TI  - Tissue distribution, expression, and antimicrobial activity of Anas platyrhynchos avian beta-defensin 6.
AB  - In this study, a novel avian beta-defensin (AvBD) was isolated from the Chaohu duck. The complete nucleotide sequence of the gene contained a 204-bp open reading frame that encoded 67 amino acids (aa), including a signal peptide of 20 aa, a propiece of 5 aa, and a mature peptide of 42 aa. The homology, characterization, and comparison of this gene with AvBD from other avian species confirmed that it was duck AvBD6. Also, the preproprotein of AvBD6 from chicken, goose, and duck was highly conserved with 100% aa homology. The AvBD6 mRNA was widely expressed in the investigated tissues of healthy 5-mo-old ducks, with the exception of the skin, kidney, and bursa. The AvBD6 mRNA was highly expressed in the spleen, lung, stomach, tongue, and egg yolk, successively; moderately expressed in the bone marrow and liver; and expressed to lower degrees in the trachea, heart, intestine, muscle, esophagus, and testis. We produced recombinant AvBD6 by expressing the gene in Escherichia coli. The yield of soluble glutathione S-transferees (GST)-AvBD6 in the inclusion bodies increased significantly as the incubation temperature was decreased from 37 to 30 degrees C. As expected, the GST-AvBD6 exhibited strong bactericidal properties [minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) = 0.5 to 2 muM] against the Aeromonas veronii biovar sobria strain BJCP-5, E. coli, and Enterococcus faecalis [ATCC 29212); it possessed medium bactericidal properties (MIC = 4 to 8 muM) against Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella enteritidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853), and Bacillus subtilis (CMCC 63501;; and it possessed low bactericidal properties (MIC = 16 muM) against Candida albicans (ATCC 10231). Additionally, the antimicrobial activity of GST-AvBD6 proved to be the same as that of synthetic AvBD6. The A. veronii biovar sobria strain BJCP-5 cells that were treated with GST-AvBD6 showed lysis and shrinkage under scanning electron microscopy. The mechanisms of AvBD6-mediated killing of A. veronii biovar sobria involved both cell lysis and nonlysis. Our results indicate that AvBD6 plays an important role in the innate immunity of the Chaohu duck.
TI  - Cost-effectiveness analysis, prevention of atopic dermatitis by oral application  of bacterial lysate in newborns/small children.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this analysis was to determine the cost-effectiveness compared to placebo of prophylactic treatment with sterile bacterial lysate (Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis) (verum) of newborns/small children with heredity for atopy [atopic dermatitis (AD)]. Infants were followed from the age of 5 weeks until 3 years of age. During this time, the number of children with AD who were treated with verum or placebo was observed at eight visits. Cost-effectiveness analyses were performed at different time points. METHODS: A randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial performed in Germany included 606 newborns. After randomization, n = 303 patients were classified in the placebo group and n = 303 in the verum group. A total of 119 participants left the study, so data from n = 250 patients of the placebo group and n = 237 patients of the verum group were available for analysis. At the beginning of the study, newborns were treated prophylactically with bacterial lysate or placebo for 26 weeks. After this, children were observed until the age of 3 years. A systematic literature research was done to evaluate treatment costs of atopic eczema in newborn/small children. Finally, 17 publications were included and checked for searched treatment costs of AD. A study was then initiated to evaluate the direct costs to statutory health insurance. Based on the described clinical trial, a decision tree model was developed. Using the evaluated direct costs and prevalence according to the clinical trial, the developed model can be used in cost-effectiveness analyses. RESULTS: The focus of the analyses was on the subgroup "single heredity for atopy" in clinical trials. Cost-effectiveness analysis showed an advantage for bacterial lysate after 3 years. To further support this result a model extension was executed; the model was expanded from 3 to 6 years. Cost-effectiveness of bacterial lysate was also proven after 6 years. CONCLUSION: Prophylactic treatment with bacterial lysate of infants with single heredity for atopy for 26 weeks in the 1st year of life is cost-effective at the age of 3 and 6 years, i.e. prophylactic use of bacterial lysate generated lower costs by leading to lower prevalence compared to placebo.
TI  - Comparison of Rosco Neo-Sensitabs with Oxoid paper disks in EUCAST disk diffusion antimicrobial susceptibility testing on Mueller-Hinton agar.
AB  - This study compared Neo-Sensitabs with Oxoid paper disks using the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) disk diffusion antimicrobial susceptibility test on Mueller-Hinton agar. The EUCAST-recommended quality control strains (Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213 and Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212) (Part I) and clinical isolates (Part II) were investigated. In Part I of the study, 27 combinations of antimicrobial agents were tested on four quality control strains repeatedly up to 60 times and zone diameters of tablets and disks were compared. In Part II of the study, 351 clinical isolates were included to cover a broad range of species, as well as resistance mechanisms. In Part I, four major deviations (>1 mm outside quality control ranges) were observed with Neo-Sensitabs. In one case with P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 (meropenem), there was a corresponding major deviation (2 mm) with the Oxoid disk. The three remaining major deviations with Neo-Sensitabs were observed with meropenem (2 mm) in E. coli ATCC 25922 and with ciprofloxacin (2 mm) and gentamicin (3 mm) in P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853. For Oxoid disks, there were only minor deviations (=1 mm outside quality control ranges) in these three cases. In Part II, there were six discrepancies, susceptible versus resistant, in 3,533 comparisons between the two methods with the clinical isolates. The Rosco Neo-Sensitabs appear to be a possible alternative to Oxoid paper disks for EUCAST disk diffusion antimicrobial susceptibility testing on Mueller-Hinton agar.
TI  - Detection and enumeration of E. coli O157:H7 in water samples by culture and molecular methods.
AB  - The performances of three chromogenic agars were evaluated for the recovery of Escherichia coli O157:H7 from spiked dechlorinated tap, ground and surface water, and treated drinking water samples. The chromogenic agars: ChromAgar O157 (CHROM), Rainbow Agar O157 (RB) and HiCrome EC O157 (HC) were compared to cefixime-tellurite Sorbitol MacConkey (CT-SMAC), commonly used for the isolation of E. coli O157:H7. Confirmation of suspect E. coli O157:H7 colonies were performed by colony real-time PCR (C-RTi-PCR) based on the presence of Shiga-toxin genes (stx1 and stx2). Recovery of inoculated E. coli O157:H7 from dechlorinated tap water indicated that RB and CHROM agars demonstrated improved recovery when compared to HC or CT-SMAC. There was a significant drop in recovery on all agars tested after 120h (day 5). Twenty dechlorinated tap and/or treated drinking water samples were inoculated with a pure culture of E. coli O157:H7 (ATCC 43894), and a mixed culture of E. coli O157:H7 (ATCC 43894), E. coli strain K-12, and Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 063589). After a 48-hour holding time, the recovery using CHROM (99%) and HC (12%) from samples contaminated with the pure culture were found to be significantly different (p<0.05). Recovery results using CHROM (39%) and CT-SMAC (32%) from samples contaminated with the mixed culture after a 48-hour holding time were not significantly different (p>0.05). Analysis by C-RTi-PCR of forty five environmental water samples (surface, sewage, and final effluents) which were negative for E. coli O157:H7 showed an incidence of false suspect positive colonies of 38% (CHROM), 53% (RB), 58% (HC), and 91% (CT-SMAC). Further analysis of eight of the environmental samples inoculated with E. coli (ATCC 43894) showed 100% recovery when utilizing CHROM, 50% when using RB and 40% when using HC. In addition, the C-RTi-PCR positive confirmation rate was 100% for CHROM and HC and 65% for RB. CHROM demonstrated improved recovery of E. coli O157:H7 over RB, HC, and CT-SMAC in terms of sensitivity and specificity.
TI  - Characterization of recombinant FAD-independent catabolic acetolactate synthase from Enterococcus faecalis V583.
AB  - The catabolic acetolactate synthase (cALS) of Enterococcus faecalis V583 was cloned, expressed in Escherichia coli, and purified to homogeneity. The purified protein had a molecular weight of 60 kDa. The cALS of E. faecalis is highly homologous with other cALSs, while sharing low homology with its anabolic counterparts. The cALS of E. faecalis exhibits optimum activity at a temperature of 37 degrees C and pH 6.8. Based on the enzyme characterization, the apparent K(m) for pyruvate was calculated to be 1.37 mM, while the K(c) for thiamin diphosphate (ThDP) and Mg(2+) were found to be 0.031 muM and 1.27 mM, respectively. Negligible absorbance at 450 nm and lack of activity enhancement upon addition of flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) to the assay buffer suggest that the cALS of E. faecalis is not FAD-dependent. The enzyme showed extreme stability against the organic solvent dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), whereas the activity decreased to less than 50% in the presence of acetone and ethanol.
TI  - The efficacy of sequential therapy using pazufloxacin followed by oral fluoroquinolones for treatment of pyelonephritis.
AB  - The efficacy of sequential therapy of pazufloxacin (PZFX), which is a parenteral  fluoroquinolone, followed by oral fluoroquinolones [tosufloxacin tosilate (TFLX) or levofloxacin (LVFX)] for treatment of pyelonephritis, was evaluated. Patients with pyelonephritis who had fever (>/=37.5 degrees C), pyuria (>/=10 white blood cells/high-power field), and bacteriuria (>/=10(4) colony-forming units/ml) were eligible for this study. PZFX (500 mg) was given intravenously twice a day for at least 3 days. If the patients were clinically improved, TFLX (150 mg) or LVFX (100 mg) was then administered orally three times a day for at least 5 days. Patients underwent clinical and microbiological evaluation at 5-9 days after final drug administration. Clinical and microbiological efficacy could be assessed in 21 of 25 cases enrolled. Both clinical and microbiological efficacy rates were 81.0 % (17/21 cases). In the effective cases, the mean administration time was 4.2 days for PZFX and 6.0 days for oral fluoroquinolones. The mean time to defervescence was 3.4 days for the effective cases. In the four treatment failure cases, three quinolone-resistant Escherichia coli and a quinolone-resistant Enterococcus faecalis were isolated. This sequential therapy seemed to be clinically effective in the treatment of pyelonephritis; however, the prevalence of quinolone-resistant E. coli should be taken into account.
TI  - Enterococcus and Streptococcus spp. associated with chronic and self-medicated urinary tract infections in Vietnam.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Urinary tract infections (UTI) are one of the most common infections  among women worldwide. E. coli often causes more than 75% of acute uncomplicated UTI, however, little is known about how recurrent UTIs and indiscriminate use of antimicrobials affect the aetiology of UTIs. This study aimed to establish the aetiology of UTI in a population of recurrent and self-medicated patients referred from pharmacies to a hospital in Hanoi, Vietnam and to describe genotypes and antimicrobial susceptibility of the associated bacterial pathogens. The aetiology of bacterial pathogens associated with UTI (defined as >/= 104 CFU/ml urine) was established by phenotypic and molecular methods. Enterococcus faecalis isolates were typed by Multi Locus Sequence Typing (MLST), Pulsed-Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE) and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. METHODS: Urine samples from 276 patients suffering symptoms of urinary tract infection were collected and cultured on Flexicult agar(R) allowing for detection of the most common urine pathogens. Patients were interviewed about underlying diseases, duration of symptoms, earlier episodes of UTI, number of episodes diagnosed by doctors and treatment in relation to UTI. All tentative E. faecalis and E. faecium isolates were identified to species level by PCR, 16S rRNA and partial sequencing of the groEL gene. E. faecalis isolates were further characterized by Multi Locus Sequence Typing and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. RESULTS: Mean age of 49 patients was 48 yrs (range was 11-86 yrs) and included 94% women. On average, patients reported to have suffered from UTI for 348 days (range 3 days-10 years, and experienced 2.7 UTIs during the previous year). Cephalosporins were reported the second drug of choice in treatment of UTI at the hospital. E. faecalis (55.1%), E. coli (12.2%) and Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus (8.2%) were main bacterial pathogens. MIC testing of E. faecalis showed susceptibility to ampicillin, penicillin and vancomycin, but high-level resistance against gentamicin (48.1%). MLST revealed 12 Sequence Types (ST) of which ST 16 made up 44.5% and showed closely related PFGE types. CONCLUSION: The different aetiology of UTI compared with reports elsewhere, where E. coli dominates, may be a result of chronic and recurrent UTIs together with indiscriminate use of antimicrobials. The similar genotypes shown by epidemiologically unrelated ST 16 isolates in Vietnam and elsewhere, suggest that E. faecalis ST 16 might represent a globally distributed clone. Treatment of UTI with cephalosporins may select for E. faecalis as it is intrinsic resistant and further studies are needed to establish the source(s) and role of E. faecalis ST 16 in acute UTI.
TI  - Resistance profiles of urinary tract infections in general practice--an observational study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Guideline recommendations on therapy in urinary tract infections are  based on antibiotic resistance rates. Due to a lack of surveillance data, little is known about resistance rates in uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI) in general practice in Germany. In a prospective observational study, urine cultures of all women presenting with urinary tract infections in general practice were analysed. Resistance rates against antibiotics recommended in German guidelines on UTI are presented. METHODS: In a prospective, multi-center observational study general practitioner included all female patients >/= 18 years with clinically suspected urinary tract infection. Only patients receiving an antibiotic therapy within the last two weeks were excluded. RESULTS: 40 practices recruited 191 female patients (mean age 52 years; range 18-96) with urinary tract infections. Main causative agent was Escherichia coli (79%) followed by Enterococcus faecalis (14%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (7.3%).Susceptibility of E.coli as the main causative agent was highest against fosfomycin and nitrofurantoin, with low resistance rates of 4,5%; 2,2%. In 17,5%, E.coli was resistant to trimethoprim and in 8,5% to ciprofloxacin. CONCLUSIONS: Resistance rates of uropathogens from unselected patients in general practice differ from routinely collected laboratory data. These results can have an impact on antibiotic prescribing and treatment recommendations.
TI  - The effects of different concentrations of chlorhexidine gluconate on the antimicrobial properties of mineral trioxide aggregate and calcium enrich mixture.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of Mineral Trioxide Aggregate (MTA) and Calcium Enrich Mixture) CEM (mixed with different concentrations of chlorhexidine (CHX). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cements used in this in vitro study included Gray proRoot MTA and CEM with the microorganisms being entrococcus faecalis, streptococcus muntas, Candida albicans, Actinomyces, Escherichia coli, and a mixture of these microorganisms. CHX was used in the form of liquid at 0.2%, 2%, and 0.12% concentrations. Contact dilution and colony count method was used to evaluate the antibacterial activity of these cements. After 0, 24, 48, 72, and 96-hour intervals, we cultured the samples on blood agar medium. Colonies were counted after incubation at 37 degrees . Data were statistically analyzed by a Kruskal-Wallis test to compare the antimicrobial activity of MTA and CEM. RESULTS: All concentrations of CHX were mixed with MTA and the CEM had antibacterial activities on all microorganisms' strains except for the Enterococcus faecalis and the mixture group. MTA had better antibacterial activity than the CEM, but this difference was not significant (P = 0.13). The mixing of MTA and the CEM with CHX significantly increased the antibacterial properties of both cements (P < 0.03). There was no statistically significant difference between the different concentrations of CHX. The antibacterial activity of the materials increased through time. CONCLUSION: The mixture of MTA and CEM with different concentration of CHX significantly increased the antibacterial activity.
TI  - Comparative study of the antimicrobial effect of three irrigant solutions (chlorhexidine, sodium hypochlorite and chlorhexidinated MUMS).
AB  - AIM: To compare the antimicrobial effect of 2% chlorhexidine, 2.5% sodium hypochlorite and MUMS containing 2% chlorhexidine. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All of the above irrigants were examined on Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus mutans, Candida albicans, Lactobacillus casei and E. coli. A total of 0.5 CC of each solution and 0.5 CC of McFarland solution bacterium were added to each examination tube. After 15, 30 and 45 minutes, colony count was performed for each tube. The difference in the number of bacteria indicated the effect taken by disinfectant material. RESULTS: MUMS containing chlorhexidine showed the antimicrobial properties just like chlorhexidine's effect against E. coli, Streptococcus mutans, Candida albicans, Enterococcus faecalis and Lactobacillus casei in preventing these entire microorganisms to incubate. Sodium hypochlorite was not effective against Enterococcus faecalis and Candida albicans incubated in 15, 30 and 45 minutes and Enterococcus faecalis in 15 minutes. CONCLUSION: MUMS has antimicrobial properties similar to chlorhexidine. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: As MUMS containing chlorhexidine can transfer chlorhexidine through its own surfactant around apical area and it can open the dentinal tubules by its own chelator for more penetration of chlorhexidine, it may be a choice for canal irrigation.
TI  - Structural insight into the Clostridium difficile ethanolamine utilisation microcompartment.
AB  - Bacterial microcompartments form a protective proteinaceous barrier around metabolic enzymes that process unstable or toxic chemical intermediates. The genome of the virulent, multidrug-resistant Clostridium difficile 630 strain contains an operon, eut, encoding a bacterial microcompartment with genes for the breakdown of ethanolamine and its utilisation as a source of reduced nitrogen and carbon. The C. difficile eut operon displays regulatory genetic elements and protein encoding regions in common with homologous loci found in the genomes of other bacteria, including the enteric pathogens Salmonella enterica and Enterococcus faecalis. The crystal structures of two microcompartment shell proteins, CD1908 and CD1918, and an uncharacterised protein with potential enzymatic activity, CD1925, were determined by X-ray crystallography. CD1908 and CD1918 display the same protein fold, though the order of secondary structure elements is permuted in CD1908 and this protein displays an N-terminal beta-strand extension. These proteins form hexamers with molecules related by crystallographic and non-crystallographic symmetry. The structure of CD1925 has a cupin beta-barrel fold and a putative active site that is distinct from the metal-ion dependent catalytic cupins. Thin-section transmission electron microscopy of Escherichia coli over-expressing eut proteins indicates that CD1918 is capable of self-association into arrays, suggesting an organisational role for CD1918 in the formation of this microcompartment. The work presented provides the basis for further study of the architecture and function of the C. difficile eut microcompartment, its role in metabolism and the wider consequences of intestinal colonisation and virulence in this pathogen.
TI  - Nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of pathogens isolated from surgical site infections (SSI) in Japan.
AB  - To investigate the trends of antimicrobial resistance in pathogens isolated from  surgical site infections (SSI), a Japanese surveillance committee conducted the first nationwide survey. Seven main organisms were collected from SSI at 27 medical centers in 2010 and were shipped to a central laboratory for antimicrobial susceptibility testing. A total of 702 isolates from 586 patients with SSI were included. Staphylococcus aureus (20.4 %) and Enterococcus faecalis (19.5 %) were the most common isolates, followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (15.4 %) and Bacteroides fragilis group (15.4 %). Methicillin-resistant S. aureus among S. aureus was 72.0 %. Vancomycin MIC 2 mug/ml strains accounted for 9.7 %. In Escherichia coli, 11 of 95 strains produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (Klebsiella pneumoniae, 0/53 strains). Of E. coli strains, 8.4 % were resistant to ceftazidime (CAZ) and 26.3 % to ciprofloxacin (CPFX). No P. aeruginosa strains produced metallo-beta-lactamase. In P. aeruginosa, the resistance rates were 7.4 % to tazobactam/piperacillin (TAZ/PIPC), 10.2 % to imipenem (IPM), 2.8 % to meropenem, cefepime, and CPFX, and 0 % to gentamicin. In the B. fragilis group, the rates were 28.6 % to clindamycin, 5.7 % to cefmetazole, 2.9 % to TAZ/PIPC and IPM, and 0 % to metronidazole (Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron; 59.1, 36.4, 0, 0, 0 %). MIC(9)(0) of P. aeruginosa isolated 15 days or later after surgery rose in TAZ/PIPC, CAZ, IPM, and CPFX. In patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score >/=3, the resistance rates of P. aeruginosa to TAZ/PIPC and CAZ were higher than in patients with ASA </=2. The data obtained in this study revealed the trend of the spread of resistance among common species that cause SSI. Timing of isolation from surgery and the patient's physical status affected the selection of resistant organisms.
TI  - Crystallization and first data collection of the putative transfer protein TraN from the Gram-positive conjugative plasmid pIP501.
AB  - Conjugative plasmid transfer is the most important route for the spread of resistance and virulence genes among bacteria. Consequently, bacteria carrying conjugative plasmids are a substantial threat to human health, especially hospitalized patients. Whilst detailed information about the process has been obtained for Gram-negative type-4 secretion systems, little is known about the corresponding mechanisms in Gram-positive (G+) bacteria. The successful purification and crystallization of the putative transfer protein TraN from the G+ conjugative model plasmid pIP501 of Enterococcus faecalis are presented. Native crystals diffracted to 1.8 A resolution on a synchrotron beamline. The crystals belonged to space group P2(1), with unit-cell parameters a=32.88, b=54.94, c=57.71 A, beta=91.89 degrees and two molecules per asymmetric unit.
TI  - In vitro development and transfer of resistance to chlortetracycline in Bacillus  subtilis.
AB  - The present criteria and rules controlling the approval of the use of probiotics  are limited to antibiotic resistance patterns and the presence of antibiotic resistance genes in bacteria. There is little information available in the literature regarding the risk of the usage of probiotics in the presence of antibiotic pressure. In this study we investigated the development and transfer of antibiotic resistance in Bacillus subtilis selected in vitro by chlortetracycline in a stepwise manner. Bacillus subtilis was exposed to increasing concentrations of chlortetracyclineto induce in vitro resistance to chlortetracycline, and the minimal inhibitory concentrations were determinedfor the mutants. Resistant B. subtilis were conjugated with Escherichia coli NK5449 and Enterococcus faecalis JH2-2 using the filter mating. Three B. subtilis tetracycline resistant mutants (namely, BS-1, BS-2, and BS-3) were derived in vitro. A tetracycline resistant gene, tet (K), was found in the plasmids of BS-1 and BS-2. Three conjugates (BS-1N, BS-2N, and BS-3N) were obtained when the resistant B. subtilis was conjugated with E. coli NK5449. The conjugation frequencies for the BS-1N, BS-2N, and BS-3N conjugates were 4.57x10(-7), 1.4x10(-7), and 1.3x10(-8), respectively. The tet(K) gene was found only in the plasmids of BS-1N. These results indicate that long-term use of probiotics under antibiotic selection pressure could cause antibiotic resistance, and the resistance gene could be transferred to other bacteria. The risk arising from the use of probiotics under antibiotic pressure should be considered in the criteria and rules for the safety assessment of probiotics.
TI  - Molecular structure, Normal Coordinate Analysis, harmonic vibrational frequencies, Natural Bond Orbital, TD-DFT calculations and biological activity analysis of antioxidant drug 7-hydroxycoumarin.
AB  - In this work, we report harmonic vibrational frequencies, molecular structure, NBO and HOMO, LUMO analysis of Umbelliferone also known as 7-hydroxycoumarin (7HC). The optimized geometric bond lengths and bond angles obtained by computation (monomer and dimmer) shows good agreement with experimental XRD data. Harmonic frequencies of 7HC were determined and analyzed by DFT utilizing 6-311+G(d,p) as basis set. The assignments of the vibrational spectra have been carried out with the help of Normal Coordinate Analysis (NCA) following the Scaled Quantum Mechanical Force Field Methodology (SQMFF). The change in electron density (ED) in the sigma* and pi* antibonding orbitals and stabilization energies E(2) have been calculated by Natural Bond Orbital (NBO) analysis to give clear evidence of stabilization originating in the hyperconjugation of hydrogen-bonded interaction. The energy and oscillator strength calculated by Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory (TD-DFT) complements with the experimental findings. The simulated spectra satisfactorily coincides with the experimental spectra. Microbial activity of studied compounds was tested against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Psuedomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Shigella flexneri, Salmonella typhi and Enterococcus faecalis.

TI  - Proteolytic activity by multiple bacterial species isolated from chronic venous leg ulcers degrades matrix substrates.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A major feature of chronic wounds is the loss of tissue, with the exposure of dermal components preventing primary closure and leading to bacterial colonization. Bacterial colonization has been proposed as one of the common underlying pathologies present in chronic wounds. The objective of this exploratory study was to identify bacteria cultured from chronic venous leg ulcers and test for proteolytic activity that degrades matrix substrates. METHOD: Bacteria were isolated, cultured, and identified from six subjects (average age = 62.8 years) over 2-10 months under an approved protocol using swabs and microbiological culture media. Proteolytic activity against (a) gelatin, (b) an elastin substrate, and (c) a serine/trypsin-sensitive substrate was determined using a colorimetric plate assay with an ELISA plate reader and zymography. RESULTS: We identified 13 bacteria that expressed proteolytic activity against one or more of the tested substrates. Of these, six were Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Corynebacterium, and Streptococcus bovis) and seven were Gram-negative (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Bacteroides fragilis, and Serratia marcescens) organisms. Two of these, S. aureus and P. aeruginosa, are recognized wound pathogens. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple bacteria species isolated from colonized venous leg ulcers have the capacity to secrete proteases capable of degrading components of the extracellular matrix important for wound healing. Matrix degradation by bacteria may contribute to delays in tissue deposition and repair, suggesting that treatment of chronic wounds should include appropriate management of colonizing bacteria.
TI  - Biochemical characterization of cardiolipin synthase mutations associated with daptomycin resistance in enterococci.
AB  - Daptomycin (DAP) resistance in enterococci has been linked to mutations in genes  that alter the cell envelope stress response (CESR) (liaFSR) and changes in enzymes that directly affect phospholipid homeostasis, and these changes may alter membrane composition, such as that of cardiolipin synthase (Cls). While Cls substitutions are observed in response to DAP therapy, the effect of these mutations on Cls activity remains obscure. We have expressed, purified, and characterized Cls enzymes from both Enterococcus faecium S447 (residues 52 to 482; Cls447a) and Enterococcus faecalis S613 (residues 53 to 483; Cls613a) as well as Cls variants harboring a single-amino-acid change derived from DAP-resistant isolates of E. faecium. E. faecium Cls447a and E. faecalis Cls613a are tightly associated with the membrane and copurify with their substrate, phosphatidylglycerol (PG), and product, cardiolipin (CL). The amount of PG that copurifies with Cls is in molar excess to protein, suggesting that the enzyme localizes to PG-rich membrane regions. Both Cls447a(H215R) and Cls447a(R218Q) showed an increase in V(max) (muM CL/min/muM protein) from 0.16 +/- 0.01 to 0.26 +/- 0.02 and 0.26 +/- 0.04, respectively, indicating that mutations associated with adaptation to DAP increase Cls activity. Modeling of Cls447a to Streptomyces sp. phospholipase D indicates that the adaptive mutations Cls447a(H215R) and Cls447a(R218Q) are proximal to the phospholipase domain 1 (PLD1) active site and near the putative nucleophile H217. As mutations to Cls are part of a larger genomic adaptation process, increased Cls activity is likely to be highly epistatic with other changes to facilitate DAP resistance.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of ZnO nanoparticles with a modified surface under ambient illumination.
AB  - In various practical applications, nanomaterials typically have functionalized surfaces. Yet, the studies of toxicity and antibacterial activity of functionalized nanoparticles are scarce. We investigated the effect of surface modifications on antibacterial activity of ZnO under ambient illumination, and we found that nanoparticles coated with different surface modifying reagents could exhibit higher or lower toxicity compared to bare ZnO, depending on the surface modifying reagent used. Different surface modifying reagent molecules resulted in differences in the release of Zn(2+) ions and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, the antibacterial activity did not correlate with the ROS levels or the Zn(2+) ion release. One of the surface-modified ZnO samples exhibited significantly lower Zn(2+) ion release while at the same time exhibiting improved antibacterial activity. In all cases, damage of the cell wall membranes and/or changes in the membrane permeability have been observed, together with the changes in ATR-FTIR spectra indicating differences in protein conformation. Mechanisms of antibacterial activity are discussed.
TI  - Triterpene saponins of Maesa lanceolata stem wood.
AB  - Phytochemical analysis of aqueous MeOH extract of Maesa lanceolata stem wood has  led to the isolation of four new triterpene saponins characterized as 16alpha,21beta-diacetoxy-22alpha-angeloyl-28-hydroxyolean-12-ene 3-O-[alpha-rhamnopyranosyl-(1'''' --> 6''')-beta-glucopyranosyl-(1''' --> 3')][beta-glucopyranosyl-(1'' --> 2')]-beta-glucuronopyranoside (1), 16alpha-acetoxy-21beta-hydroxy-22alpha-angeloyl-13beta,28-oxydoolean-28alpha-ol 3-O-[alpha-rhamnopyranosyl-(1'''' --> 6''')-beta-glucopyranosyl-(1''' --> 4')][beta-glucopyranosyl-(1'' --> 2')]-alpha-arabinopyranoside (2), 16alpha-acetoxy-21beta,22alpha-diangeloyl-13beta,28-epoxyoleanane 3-O-[alpha-rhamnopyranosyl-(1'''' --> 6''')-beta-glucopyranosyl-(1''' --> 4')][beta-glucopyranosyl-(1'' --> 2')]-beta-xylopyranoside (3), and 16alpha,22alpha-diacetoxy-13beta,28-oxydoolean-28alpha-ol 3-O-[beta-glucopyranosyl-(1'' --> 2')][beta-glucopyranosyl-(1''' --> 3')]-beta-glucuronopyranoside (4), together with the known compounds beta-acetylamyrin, physcion, emodin, chrysophanol, ursolic acid, 16alpha-hydroxy-12-oleanene 3-O-glucoside, beta-amyrin, sitosterol 3-O-beta-glucoside, stigmasterol, and 3beta,28-dihydroxyolean-12-ene. Their structural elucidation was accomplished by homo- and heteronuclear 2D NMR technique as well as comparison with data from known compounds. The in vitro antibacterial activity of the aqueous MeOH extract was also investigated and zones of inhibition ranging from 32 +/- 1.1 to 14 +/- 0.2 mm were observed. Among the isolates, compound 1 was the most active with an minimum inhibitory concentration value of 25 mug/ml against Staphylococcus aureus.

AB  - The aim of this study was to obtain saccharide (dextran and sucrose)-coated maghemite nanoparticles with antibacterial activity. The polysaccharide-coated maghemite nanoparticles were synthesized by an adapted coprecipitation method. X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies demonstrate that the obtained polysaccharide-coated maghemite nanoparticles can be indexed into the spinel cubic lattice with a lattice parameter of 8.35 A. The refinement of XRD spectra indicated that no other phases except the maghemite are detectable. The characterization of the polysaccharide-coated maghemite nanoparticles by various techniques is described. The antibacterial activity of these polysaccharide-coated maghemite nanoparticles (NPs) was tested against Pseudomonas aeruginosa 1397, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Candida krusei 963, and Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and was found to be dependent on the polysaccharide type. The antibacterial activity of dextran-coated maghemite was significantly higher than that of sucrose-coated maghemite. The antibacterial studies showed the potential of dextran-coated iron oxide NPs to be used in a wide range of medical infections.
TI  - Human serum albumin stabilized gold nanoclusters as selective luminescent probes  for Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - In this work, human serum albumin (HSA) stabilized gold nanoclusters (HSA-AuNCs)  with reddish photoluminescence were used as sensing probes for pathogenic bacteria including Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli J96, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, pandrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (PDRAB), Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Streptococcus pyogenes, and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (VRE). We discovered that HSA-AuNCs have unique affinity with S. aureus and MRSA. In addition to demonstrating the selective sensing ability of HSA-AuNCs toward S. aureus and MRSA, the binding peptide motifs identified from HSA-AuNCs were characterized by mass spectrometry. The identified binding peptides were further used as the reducing and stabilizing agents for generation of peptide-bound AuNCs (Pep-AuNCs). The generated Pep-AuNCs were demonstrated to have the binding affinities with S. aureus and MRSA.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of the venom of Heterometrus xanthopus.
AB  - Heterometrus xanthopus (Scorpion) is one of the most venomous and ancient arthropods. Its venom contains anti-microbial peptides like hadrurin, scorpine, Pandinin 1, and Pandinin 2 that are able to effectively kill multidrug-resistant pathogens. The present study was conducted to evaluate the anti-bacterial activity of H. xanthopus venom. Six Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial strains were tested against 1/100, 1/10, and 1/1 fractions of distilled water diluted and crude venom. 1/100 and 1/10 dilutions were not successful in any of the six bacterial strains studied while the 1/1 dilution was effective on Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633, Salmonella typhimurium ATCC 14028, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 with highest zone of inhibition were obtained on B. subtilis. Crude venom was effective against Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 14506, B. subtilis, S. typhimurium, and P. aeruginosa. The most effective results were observed on B. subtilis.
TI  - Rapid discrimination of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria in liquid samples by using NaOH-sodium dodecyl sulfate solution and flow cytometry.
AB  - BACKGROUND: For precise diagnosis of urinary tract infections (UTI), and selection of the appropriate prescriptions for their treatment, we explored a simple and rapid method of discriminating gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria in liquid samples. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We employed the NaOH-sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) solution conventionally used for plasmid extraction from Escherichia coli and the automated urine particle analyzer UF-1000i (Sysmex Corporation) for our novel method. The NaOH-SDS solution was used to determine differences in the cell wall structures between gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, since the tolerance to such chemicals reflects the thickness and structural differences of bacterial cell walls. The UF-1000i instrument was used as a quantitative bacterial counter. We found that gram-negative bacteria, including E. coli, in liquid culture could easily be lysed by direct addition of equal volumes of NaOH-SDS solution. In contrast, Enterococcus faecalis, which is a gram-positive bacterium, could not be completely lysed by the solution. We then optimized the reaction time of the NaOH-SDS treatment at room temperature by using 3 gram-positive and 4 gram-negative bacterial strains and determined that the optimum reaction time was 5 min. Finally, in order to evaluate the generalizability of this method, we treated 8 gram-positive strains and 8 gram-negative strains, or 4 gram-positive and 4 gram-negative strains incubated in voluntary urine from healthy volunteers in the same way and demonstrated that all the gram-positive bacteria were discriminated quantitatively from gram negative bacteria using this method. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Using our new method, we could easily discriminate gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria in liquid culture media within 10 min. This simple and rapid method may be useful for determining the treatment course of patients with UTIs, especially for those without a prior history of UTIs. The method may be easily applied in order to obtain additional information for clinical prescriptions from bacteriuria.
TI  - Study of photodynamic effects on NIH 3T3 cell line and bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial resistance to antibiotics is a constantly growing challenge. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) offers a new approach to the treatment of bacterial and viral diseases. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of photosensitizers used in PDT applied to cell lines and bacterial strains. METHODS: We tested the cytotoxicity and phototoxicity of 3 photosensitizers: TPPS4, ZnTPPS4 and TMPyP applied to the NIH3T3 cell line using two established methods for measuring ROS production and, MTT viability assay. Bacterial viability was determined spectrophotometrically over 24 h following PDT. RESULTS: The most efficient photosensitiser was TMPyP as it reduced the viability of the NIH3T3 cell line by more than 85%. In general, the photosensitisers were more phototoxic to the two Gram-positive bacterial strains, Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus. The viability of E. faecalis was reduced to 78 % by a dose radiation 0.5 J/cm(2) and concentration of TMPyP 1.562 micromol/L. The viability of bacterium S. aureus was reduced to 23 % when exposed to a radiation dose 0.5 J/cm(2) and 100 micromol/L concentration of ZnTPPS4. The highest viability decrease (15 %) for Pseudomonas aeruginosa was caused by 0.5 J/cm(2) radiation dose and 50 micromol/L TMPyP concentration. Escherichia coli proved to be PDT resistant as the bacterial viability was higher than 90%. CONCLUSIONS: The goal of the present study was to test the efficiency of photosensitizers on the NIH 3T3 cell line and bacterial cells. Subsequently we would like to study effectiveness of photosensitizers bound to carriers (for example cyclodextrins) on other cell line and bacterial strain.
TI  - Activity of moxifloxacin, imipenem, and ertapenem against Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterococcus faecalis, and Bacteroides fragilis in monocultures and mixed cultures in an in vitro pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model simulating concentrations in the human pancreas.
AB  - The activities of moxifloxacin, imipenem, and ertapenem against pathogens causing severe necrotizing pancreatitis were studied in an in vitro pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) model. Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterococcus faecalis, and Bacteroides fragilis were exposed in monocultures and mixed cultures to concentrations of the three agents comparable to those in the human pancreas. Moxifloxacin was more active than the two carbapenems in monocultures and mixed cultures, reducing the numbers of CFU more drastically and more rapidly.
TI  - Evaluation of microbial survival post-incidence on fresh Mozzarella cheese.
AB  - Commercial fresh Mozzarella cheese is made by direct acidification and is stored  dry or in water without salt addition. The cheese has a shelf life of 6 wk, but usually develops an off-flavor and loses textural integrity by 4 wk, potentially due to the lack of salt and high moisture that allow the outgrowth of undesirable bacteria. To understand how microbial incidence affects cheese quality and how incident pathogen-related bacteria are limited by salt level during refrigerated storage, we made fresh Mozzarella cheese with high (2%) and low (0.5%) salt. The high-salt cheese was packaged and stored dry. The low-salt cheese was packaged and stored either dry or in 0.5% salt brine. One portion of cheeses was evaluated for surviving incident microbes by aerobic plate counts, coliform counts, and psychrophilic bacterial counts, of which coliforms and psychrophiles were not detected over 9 wk. Aerobic plate counts remained at 100 to 300 cfu/g up to 2 wk but increased by 1,000- to 10,000-fold between 4 and 6 wk at all salt levels and storage conditions. Other portions of cheeses were inoculated with either Escherichia coli or Enterococcus faecalis, both of which increased by 100-fold over 90 d of storage. Interestingly, E. coli added to the cheese brine first grew in the brine by 100-fold before attaching to the cheese, whereas Ent. faecalis attached to the cheese within 24h and grew only on the cheese. We conclude that incident bacteria, even from similar environments, may attach to cheese curd and survive differently in fresh Mozzarella cheese than in brine. Overall, 2% salt was insufficient to control bacterial growth, and slow-growing, cold- and salt-tolerant bacteria may survive and spoil fresh Mozzarella cheese.
TI  - A comparative study to determine the recovery rate of microorganisms of bloodstream infections: two versus three blood culture specimens.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: There has been a development of automated and continuous-monitoring blood culture systems that are more sensitive than conventional systems for the detection of microorganisms. Whether two or three blood culture specimens obtained during a 24-hour period using these automated systems achieving a higher recovery rate of microorganism remains to be determined. The present study was aimed to compare the recovery rates of microorganism of blood-stream infections (BSIs) using two and three blood culture specimens. MATERIAL AND METHOD: A prospective investigator-blinded study was carried out in patients who needed to have blood cultures in medicine wards and intensive care units as well as an emergency room of King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand, between October 1, 2010 and March 31, 2011. Three blood culture specimens were obtained from each patient during a 24-hour period. Each specimen was inoculated into an aerobic bottle of blood culture broth (TREK Diagnostics, Cleveland, OH, US), and then incubated at 37 degrees C for seven days. RESULTS: Of 568 patients, there were 116 (20.4%) unimicrobial episodes with three blood cultures obtained during a 24-hour period. There were 70 (12.3%) and 46 (8.1%) episodes of true pathogen and contaminant, respectively. The recovery rates of true pathogen were 75.7% (53 isolates), 87.1% (61 isolates), and 100% (70 isolates) with the first, second, and third blood culture specimens, respectively (p < 0.05 between the recovery rate with the first two and the third blood culture specimens). There were 25 (35.7%), 38 (58.6%) isolates, and four (5.7%) of Gram-positive, Gram-negative bacteria, and fungi, respectively. Among 25 Gram-positive bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus was the most common isolate (10, 14.3%), followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae (5, 7.1%) and Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (3, 10% each). Among 38 Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was the most common isolate (13, 18. 6%), followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8, 11.4%), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (6, 8.6%). The sensitivity and specificity of the recovery rate of microorganisms using two blood culture specimens were 85.7% and 92.3%, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of the recovery rate of microorganisms using three blood culture specimens were 100% and 90.8%, respectively. CONCLUSION: To the best of the authors'knowledge, the present study is the first prospective study to compare the recovery rate of microorganisms of BSIs between the two and three blood culture specimens using the VersaTREK blood culture system. Three blood culture specimens are required to achieve the recovery rate of more than 99%.
TI  - Removal of faecal indicator pathogens from waters and wastewaters by photoelectrocatalytic oxidation on TiO(2)/Ti films under simulated solar radiation.
AB  - PURPOSE: The disinfection efficiency of water and secondary treated wastewater by means of photoelectrocatalytic oxidation (PEC) using reference strains of Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli as faecal indicators was evaluated. Operating parameters such as applied potential (2-10 V), initial bacterial concentration (10(3)-10(7) CFU/mL), treatment time (up to 90 min) and aqueous matrix (pure water and treated effluent) were assessed concerning their impact on disinfection. METHODS: PEC experiments were carried out using a TiO(2)/Ti film anode and a zirconium cathode in the presence of simulated solar radiation. Bacterial inactivation was monitored by the culture method and real-time SYBR green PCR. RESULTS: A 6.2 log reduction in E. faecalis population was achieved after 15 min of PEC treatment in water at 10 V of applied potential and an initial concentration of 10(7) CFU/mL; pure photocatalysis (PC) led to only about 4.3 log reduction, whilst negligible inactivation was recorded when the respective electrochemical oxidation process was applied (i.e. without radiation). PEC efficiency was generally improved increasing the applied potential and decreasing initial bacterial concentration. Regarding real wastewater, E. coli was more susceptible than E. faecalis during treatment at a potential of 5 V. Wastewater disinfection was affected by its complex composition and the contained mixed bacterial populations, yielding lower inactivation rates compared to water treatment. Screening the results obtained from both applied techniques (culture method and real-time PCR), there was a discrepancy regarding the recorded time periods of total bacterial inactivation, with qPCR revealing longer periods for complete bacterial reduction. CONCLUSIONS: PEC is superior to PC in terms of E. faecalis inactivation presumably due to a more efficient separation and utilization of the photogenerated charge carriers, and it is mainly affected by the applied potential, initial bacterial concentration and the aqueous matrix.
TI  - Antifungal activity and composition of essential oils of Conyza canadensis herbs  and roots.
AB  - Essential oils from herbs and roots of Conyza canadensis (horseweed), collected in Hungary, were obtained by hydrodistillation. The chemical compositions of the oils were analysed by combination of GC and GC/MS. The major constituent of the oil obtained from the aerial parts of horseweed was limonene (78%), while the main component of root oil was 2Z,8Z-matricaria ester. The antimicrobial activities of the oils were tested on Gram-positive (Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pyogenes), Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) bacteria, reference fungal strains, and fungal strains isolated from patients (Candida, Cryptococcus, Trichophyton, Rhodotorula, and Aspergillus) by agar disc diffusion and broth dilution methods. None of the oils showed any activity against the tested bacterial strains, but exhibited moderate-to-strong activity against all fungi with the only exception of A. fumigatus. The highest zone of inhibition was observed in case of Cryptococcus neoformans and Trichophyton interdigitalis.
TI  - The changing epidemiology of bacteraemias in Europe: trends from the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System.
AB  - We investigated bacteraemia trends for five major bacterial pathogens, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium, and determined how expanding antimicrobial resistance influenced the total burden of bacteraemias in Europe. Aetiological fractions of species and antibiotic phenotypes were extracted from the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System (EARSS) database for laboratories, which consistently reported between 2002 and 2008. Trend analyses used generalized linear models. Robustness of results was assessed by iterative analysis for different geographic regions. From 2002 to 2008, the overall number of reports increased annually by 6.4% (95% confidence interval (CI) 6.2-6.5%), from 46 095 to 67 876. In the subset of laboratories providing denominator information, the overall incidence increased from 0.58/1000 patient-days to 0.90/1000 patient-days (7.2% per year; 95% CI 6.9-7.5%). The frequency of reported bacteraemia isolates of S. aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae increased moderately, while increase in E. coli and Enterococcus faecium was more pronounced. Bacteraemias caused by methicillin-resistant S. aureus increased until 2005 (7.6% per year; 95% CI 6.1-9.1%), and then decreased (-4.8% per year; 95% CI -6.1 to -3.5%), whereas the number attributable to methicillin-sensitive S. aureus increased continuously (3.4% per year; 95% CI 3.0-3.7). Increasing rates of E. coli were mainly caused by antibiotic-resistant phenotypes. Our data suggest that the burden of bacterial bloodstream infection has been increasing for all species during EARSS surveillance. Trends were mainly driven by resistant strains and clearly dissociated between resistant and susceptible isolates. It appears that infections with resistant clones add to rather than replace infections caused by susceptible bacteria. As a consequence, expansion of antibiotic resistance creates an additional strain on healthcare systems.
TI  - The effect of a wound care solution containing polyhexanide and betaine on bacterial counts: results of an in vitro study .
AB  - Polyhexanide and betaine topical solution is used in the management of infected wounds as a cleaning agent. An in vitro study was conducted to examine the antimicrobial effects of a solution containing 0.1% of the antimicrobial agent polyhexanide and 0.1% of the surfactant betaine. Three batches of each product were tested, and culture results of 13 microorganisms were evaluated after 7, 14, and 28 days using USP <51> methodology. Growth reduction was identical at each day following exposure to the solution in all micro-organisms except Aspergillus brasiliensis. A range of 5.3-log to 5.8-log reduction was seen for the following micro-organisms: Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Candida albicans, S. aureus, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterobacter cloacae, and E. faecalis. For A. brasiliensis, reductions were 2.1-log, 2.3-log and 2.8-log at 7, 14, and 28 days, respectively. The results of this study indicate a 4+ log inhibition of activity in 12 of 13 micro-organisms exposed to the solution. Research to elucidate the potential clinical effects of these observations is needed.
TI  - Impact of pH on activity of trimethoprim, fosfomycin, amikacin, colistin and ertapenem in human urine.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Although major impairment of activity at lower pH values has been reported for fluoroquinolones, acidification is a widely recommended practice for the prophylaxis and treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs). Until now, there is little evidence for the influence of pH on the activity on other antimicrobial classes in urine. METHODS: Bacterial growth curves of Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 29213), Klebsiella oxytoca (ATCC 700324), Proteus mirabilis (ATCC 14153), Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922) and Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29212) were performed in Mueller-Hinton broth and in pooled human urine with a pH of between 5.0 and 8.0. Bacterial killing of trimethoprim, fosfomycin, amikacin, colistin and ertapenem against the five strains (where appropriate) was determined consecutively at concentrations equal to the MIC. RESULTS: While no difference in the bacterial growth of E. coli, S. aureus, P. mirabilis and K. oxytoca was observed at different pH values, bacterial growth of E. faecalis was significantly reduced at low pH. Acidification to pH 5 impaired the antimicrobial activity of all investigated antibiotics, i.e. the net effect of bacterial growth and killing resulted in increased colony-forming units/ml at the end of the experiment. CONCLUSION: The present in vitro findings indicate that acidification of urine during the treatment of UTIs should be carefully considered. While growth curves of one strain supports the concept of therapeutic or prophylactic acidification during UTIs, the most common pathogen, E. coli, was not affected by low pH. Independent of the investigated strain or antibiotic, pH values below 6 lead to a reduction of antimicrobial activity.
TI  - Computer keyboard covers impregnated with a novel antimicrobial polymer significantly reduce microbial contamination.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Contaminated computer keyboards have been acknowledged as a potential source for bacterial transmission between health care providers and patients. Biosafe HM 4100 is an antimicrobial polymer that can be incorporated into the polyurethane material used to make keyboard covers. This study aimed to determine whether plastic keyboard covers containing HM 4100 effectively minimize the survival of bacterial species commonly present on health care environmental surfaces. METHODS: Polyurethane material that contained 0.5% HM 4100, 1% HM 4100, and 1% HM 4100 with spray coating of 1% HM 4100 were tested. In 2 separate experiments, the surfaces of test materials were inoculated with suspensions of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (VREF), Escherichia coli, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Viability was assessed on the materials at 0, 10, 30, 60, 120, and 240 minutes after inoculation. RESULTS: Maximum reductions in viability were observed for all 4 organisms at the longest tested time period on each test material. Mean reductions on the 0.5% HM 4100 material at 240 minutes were 99.99% for E coli, 97.8% for MRSA, 95.0% for VREF, and 92.1% for P aeruginosa. Mean reductions on the 1% HM 4100 at 120 minutes were 99.9% for VREF, 99.9% for MRSA, 99.9% for P aeruginosa, and 99.5% for E coli. Mean reductions on the 1% HM 4100 plus spray coating at 30 minutes were 99.9% for E coli, 99.8% for VREF, 98.8% for P aeruginosa, and 97.2% for MRSA. CONCLUSIONS: Incorporation of the HM 4100 antimicrobial polymer into polyurethane keyboard material may reduce the hand carriage of bacteria between health care providers and patients.
TI  - The relative importance of Staphylococcus saprophyticus as a urinary tract pathogen: distribution of bacteria among urinary samples analysed during 1 year at a major Swedish laboratory.
AB  - To determine the distribution of urinary tract pathogens with focus on Staphylococcus saprophyticus and analyse the seasonality, antibiotic susceptibility, and gender and age distributions in a large Swedish cohort. S. saprophyticus is considered an important causative agent of urinary tract infection (UTI) in young women, and some earlier studies have reported up to approximately 40% of UTIs in this patient group being caused by S. saprophyticus. We hypothesized that this may be true only in very specific outpatient settings. During the year 2010, 113,720 urine samples were sent for culture to the Karolinska University Hospital, from both clinics in the hospital and from primary care units. Patient age, gender and month of sampling were analysed for S. saprophyticus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis. Species data were obtained for 42,633 (37%) of the urine samples. The most common pathogens were E. coli (57.0%), Enterococcus faecalis (6.5%), K. pneumoniae (5.9%), group B streptococci (5.7%), P. mirabilis (3.0%) and S. saprophyticus (1.8%). The majority of subjects with S. saprophyticus were women 15-29 years of age (63.8%). In this age group, S. saprophyticus constituted 12.5% of all urinary tract pathogens. S. saprophyticus is a common urinary tract pathogen in young women, but its relative importance is low compared with E. coli even in this patient group. For women in other ages and for men, growth of S. saprophyticus is a quite uncommon finding.
TI  - Survey on hospital-acquired urinary tract infection in neurological intensive care unit.
AB  - This study aimed to explore the causes, incidence, and risk factors of urinary tract infection patients in neurological intensive care unit (ICU). Patients (n = 916) admitted to the neurological ICU from January 2005 to December 2010 were retrospectively surveyed for urinary tract infections. There were 246 patients in neurological ICU who were diagnosed with hospital-acquired urinary tract infection during that period of time (26.9%). Forty-three cases were upper urinary tract infection, and 203 cases were lower urinary tract infection. The top three strains were Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Older age (UTI rate, 22.6%), female patients (21.7%), hospital stay for more than 7 days (16.7%), diabetes (11.7%), and catheterization (21.1%) were the risk factors for hospital-acquired urinary tract infection. There is a high incidence of nosocomial urinary tract infection in the neurological intensive care unit. Active prevention program and surveillance need to be carried out in neurological ICU, especially in those with risk factors.
TI  - Structural basis for TetM-mediated tetracycline resistance.
AB  - Ribosome protection proteins (RPPs) confer tetracycline resistance by binding to  the ribosome and chasing the drug from its binding site. The current model for the mechanism of action of RPPs proposes that drug release is indirect and achieved via conformational changes within the drug-binding site induced upon binding of the RPP to the ribosome. Here we report a cryo-EM structure of the RPP TetM in complex with the 70S ribosome at 7.2-A resolution. The structure reveals the contacts of TetM with the ribosome, including interaction between the conserved and functionally critical C-terminal extension of TetM and the decoding center of the small subunit. Moreover, we observe direct interaction between domain IV of TetM and the tetracycline binding site and identify residues critical for conferring tetracycline resistance. A model is presented whereby TetM directly dislodges tetracycline to confer resistance.
TI  - Chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oil of Lippia grandis Schauer (Verbenaceae) from the western Amazon.
AB  - Lippia grandis Schauer is an aromatic plant that has been used as a spice in Brazilian culinary and in traditional medicine to treat liver disease, disorders of the stomach and throat infections. We determined the chemical composition of the essential oil of L. grandis and evaluated its potential for the treatment of clinically-important pathogenic micro-organisms. The essential oil was obtained by hydrodistillation and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), giving carvacrol (37.12%), rho-cymene (11.64%), and thymol (7.83%) as the main components. The agar disk diffusion method of the essential oil was effective against 75% of the micro-organisms analyzed, in particular, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Escherichia coli. The minimum inhibitory concentration was 0.57 mg/ml for E. faecalis and 1.15 mg/ml for all the other strains. The results indicate that the essential oil of L. grandis contains chemical compounds with good potential for the treatment of infections.
TI  - Synergistic bactericidal activity between hyperosmotic stress and membrane-disrupting nanoemulsions.
AB  - There is a clear clinical need for alternative types of non-antibiotic biocides due to the rising global health concern of microbial drug resistance. In this work, a novel antibacterial concept was delineated that utilized hyperosmotic stress (H) in concert with membrane-disrupting nanoemulsions (NEs). The antibacterial effects of either H or a NE, as well as in combination (H+NE), were assessed in vitro using an Escherichia coli model. It was found that exposure to H or NE alone produced dose-dependent bacteriostatic and bactericidal effects, respectively. However, the bactericidal action of NE was significantly amplified in the presence of H. Outcomes following H+NE exposure included rapid efflux of K(+) and nucleic acids, increased membrane permeability and a reduction in both intracellular ATP and cell viability. Further inspection of morphology by electron microscopy highlighted cell shrinkage, membrane dissolution and bacteriolysis. Pathogen inactivation occurred immediately upon contact with H+NE. The effects of H, NE and H+NE against Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus and meticillin-resistant S. aureus isolates were also examined. Similar to the Escherichia coli model, H+NE showed antibacterial synergism in these organisms when classified by the Chou-Talalay combination index for two-agent interactions. This synergistic interaction suggests that the H+NE platform may potentially serve as a new paradigm in disinfectants, antiseptics and antibacterial wound dressings. The H+NE mechanism of action was termed osmopermeation, as a descriptor for the underlying inactivation process.
TI  - Aerobic vaginitis and mixed infections: comparison of clinical and laboratory findings.
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the clinical features of aerobic vaginitis (AV) and mixed infections with AV to achieve efficient diagnosis. METHODS: From April 2008 to August 2009, 657 consecutive outpatients with vaginal symptoms in gynecology clinic in the General Hospital of Tianjin Medical University were investigated. Samples were taken for examination of vaginal discharge and fresh wet mount microscopy. AV, bacterial vaginosis (BV), vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC), and trichomonal vaginitis (TV) were diagnosed according to standardized definitions. Sixty patients with single AV were randomly selected over the same period. Each patient accepted moxifloxacin therapy. Two kinds of treatment course (400 mg qd, 6 days or 400 mg qd, 12 days) were given. Clinical features and laboratory test results in the first visit and follow-ups were recorded and statistically analyzed. RESULT: Among the 657 cases, AV was found in 23.74 % of the cases (156/657). AV mixed infections were diagnosed in 53.85 % (84/156): the mixed infections included VVC (32/84, 38.10 %), BV (31/84, 36.90 %), and TV (21/84, 25.00 %). Common symptoms of AV were a change in the characteristics of the discharge (44/72, 61.11 %) and increased discharge (30/72, 41.67 %). Vaginal pH was usually higher than 4.5 (63/72, 87.50 %). Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus viridans, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus epidermidis were frequently isolated. There is no statistically significant difference between two moxifloxacin treatment groups (p > 0.05). Cure rate was 89.7 % in 6-day group, and 71.4 % in 12-day group. CONCLUSIONS: AV is a common vaginal infection, and it is often mixed with other infections, especially VVC, BV and TV. The symptoms and signs of AV mixed infections are atypical. If a patient has vaginal complaints, it is necessary to determine whether AV or mixed infections are present. Oral moxifloxacin is effective in treating AV, and an appropriate course should be selected taking the severity of AV into consideration.
TI  - In vivo exposure of Mytilus edulis to living enteric bacteria: a threat for immune competency?
AB  - Mussels are widespread in coastal environments and experience various physical, chemical, and bacteriological conditions. Owing to the increase of coastal urbanization, mussels are now commonly exposed not only to indigenous bacteria, but also to enteric bacteria originating from pulsed and chronic sewage discharges into coastal environments. Due to its broad resilience to environmental variations, the blue mussel Mytilus edulis is commonly used as an indicator of environmental quality in bio-monitoring programs. However, since mussel immune system capabilities may be affected by the presence of exogenous fecal bacteria in coastal seawater subjected to sewage discharges, we aimed to determine the effect of in vivo bacterial challenges on mussels' immune competency by using two exogenous enteric bacterial strains, Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis, and an indigenous bacterial strain Vibrio splendidus (as control). Bacterial strains were tested individually, by injection into the posterior adductor muscle at three different cell densities (10(2), 10(3), and 10(4) cells). Unlike classic in vitro experiments using higher bacterial concentrations, neither the enteric bacteria nor the indigenous strain induced significant increase or decrease of either cell-mediated (phagocytosis, reactive oxygen species, and NO(x) production) or humoral components (prophenoloxidase-like, acid phosphatase, and L-leucine-aminopeptidase production) of the immune system. This study demonstrates that, at low concentrations, E. coli and E. faecalis do not represent an additional threat that could impair M. edulis immune competency and, as a consequence, its potential of survival in coastal areas subjected to sewage discharges.
TI  - Comparative analysis of classical and molecular microbiology methods for the detection of Escherichia coli and Enterococcus spp. in well water.
AB  - The microbiological quality of 165 1 litre well water samples collected in the Quebec City region was assessed by culture-based methods (mFC agar, Chromocult coliform agar, Colilert((R)), MI agar, Chromocult enterococci, Enterolert, and mEI agar) and by a molecular microbiology strategy, dubbed CRENAME-rtPCR, developed for the detection of Escherichia coli, Enterococcus spp., Enterococcus faecalis/faecium, and Bacillus atrophaeus subsp. globigii. In these drinking water samples, approved culture-based methods detected E. coli at rates varying from 1.8 to 3.6% and Enterococcus spp. at rates varying from 3.0 to 11.5%, while the molecular microbiology approach for E. coli was found to be as efficient, detecting contamination in 3.0% of samples. In contrast, CRENAME-rtPCR detected Enterococcus spp. in 27.9% of samples while the E. faecalis/faecium molecular assay did not uncover a single contaminated sample, thereby revealing a discrepancy in the coverage of waterborne enterococcal species detected by classical and molecular microbiology methods. The validation of the CRENAME-E. coli rtPCR test as a new tool to assess the quality of drinking water will require larger scale studies elaborated to demonstrate its equivalence to approved methods.
TI  - The influence of predation and competition on the survival of commensal and pathogenic fecal bacteria in aquatic habitats.
AB  - The role of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) in water quality assessment is to provide a warning of the increased risk of pathogen presence. An effective surrogate for waterborne pathogens would have similar survival characteristics in aquatic environments. Although the effect of abiotic factors such as sunlight and salinity on the survival of FIB and pathogens are becoming better understood, the effect of the indigenous microbiota is not well characterized. The influence of biotic factors on the survival of non-pathogenic Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, and E. coli O157:H7 were compared in fresh (river) water and sediments over 5 days. Treatments were (i) disinfection (filtration of water and baking of sediments) to remove indigenous protozoa (predators) and bacteria (competitors), and (ii) kanamycin treatment to reduce competition from indigenous bacteria. The disinfection treatment significantly increased survival of E. coli, E. coli O157:H7 and Ent. faecalis in the water column. In sediments, survival of FIB but not that of E. coli O157:H7 increased in disinfected treatments, indicating that the pathogen's survival was unaffected by the natural microbiota. Location (water or sediment) influenced bacterial survival more than species/type in the disinfection experiment. In the competition experiments where only the natural bacterial flora was manipulated, the addition of kanamycin did not affect the survival of Ent. faecalis, but resulted in greater survival of E. coli in water and sediment. Species/type influenced survival more than the level of competition in this experiment. This study demonstrates the complexity of interactions of FIB and pathogens with indigenous microbiota and location in aquatic habitats, and argues against over-generalizing conclusions derived from experiments restricted to a particular organism or habitat.
TI  - Retention of antimicrobial activity after reconstitution of doxycycline gel.
AB  - Doxycycline gel is licensed for the treatment of periodontal disease in dogs. Package labeling indicates the product is stable after reconstitution of antibiotic with polymer gel for up to 3-days when stored at room temperature. The purpose of this study was to determine if reconstituted doxycycline gel retained antimicrobial activity for greater than 3-days. The antibiotic activity of reconstituted doxycycline gel was evaluated against antimicrobial testing strains of bacteria and bacteria collected from throat swabs of 2 dogs using a standard disc diffusion assay. Our results showed that reconstituted doxycycline gel retained undiminished antimicrobial activity for a minimum of 8-weeks.
TI  - [Spectrum and drug sensitivity of pathogenic bacteria in children with nephrotic  syndrome complicated by urinary tract infection: an analysis of 97 cases].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the spectrum and drug sensitivity of pathogenic bacteria in children with nephrotic syndrome (NS) complicated by urinary tract infection (UTI). METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed on the spectrum and drug sensitivity of pathogenic bacteria in 97 children with NS complicated by UTI, who hospitalized from January to December, 2011. RESULTS: The incidence of UTI in children with NS was 36.5%. It was significantly more common in children with recurrent NS than in those with primary NS (44.0% vs 31.9%; P<0.05). These cases mainly presented with asymptomatic bacteriuria. Enterococcus was the most common pathogenic bacteria (50.5%), including Enterococcus faecium (29.4%) and Enterococcus faecalis (21.1%), followed by Gram-negative bacteria, such as Escherichia coli (15.6%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (14.7%). Enterococcus was highly sensitive to nitrofurantoin, vacomycin and linezolid, but was highly resistant to tetracycline and moxifloxacin. More multi-resistant strains were detected in Enterococcus faecium than in Enterococcus faecalis (72% vs 17%; P<0.05). Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were highly sensitive to amikacin, imipenem and piperacillin/tazobactam. Of the Gram-negative bacteria, 25% produced extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs). ESBLs-producing bacteria had 100% sensitivity to imipenem, amikacin and piperacillin/tazobactam but were highly resistant to ampicillin, cefazolin and ceftriaxone. CONCLUSIONS: Children with recurrent NS are more susceptible to UTI than those with primary NS. Enterococcus is becoming major pathogenic bacteria for UTI in children with NS and has relatively high drug resistance, and most strains of Enterococcus faecium are multi-resistant.
TI  - Phytochemical profiles of volatile constituents from Centaurea ragusina leaves and flowers and their antimicrobial effects.
AB  - The volatile oils obtained from the leaves and flowers of the Croatian endemic plant Centaurea ragusina L. were evaluated for antimicrobial activity. The chemical compositions, determined by GC and GC-MS, were complex, with sesquiterpenes the most abundant class of compound. Nonterpene hydrocarbons were also identified in high quantities, while acids and ketones were found in high quantities only in the leaf volatile oil. Aldehydes, alcohols, esters and other compounds were identified in lower quantities. Antimicrobial effects of the volatile samples were investigated by using the disc diffusion and microdilution assays. They were found to inhibit a wide range of bacteria and fungi, causing in vitro growth inhibition at a concentration of 250 microg/mL. The volatile oils displayed great antibacterial potential with MIC values ranging from 16 to 128 microg/mL against the Gram-positive bacteria Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus, and lesser activity against the Gram-negative bacteria Cronobacter sakazakii, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as fungal strains (MIC = 32-128 microg/mL).
TI  - Prevention of initial biofilm formation on ureteral stents using a sustained releasing varnish containing chlorhexidine: in vitro study.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Ureteral stents are being used exceedingly in the field of urology, and with advancements in endourology, this trend is increasing. Bacterial colonization and proliferation on the stent surface may result in urinary tract infections (UTIs) necessitating the administration of antibiotics that, in turn, may lead to the development of antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains. Several studies have shown that sustained release varnish (SRV) combined with antibiotics or antiseptics can prevent the proliferation of bacteria on urethral catheters. This is the first study that evaluates this technique implemented on ureteral stents. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated growth inhibition on ureteral stent segments coated with chlorhexidine (CHX) 1% SRV. The tests were conducted using common urinary pathogens: Enterococci, Pseudomonas, and Escherichia coli. Coated stent segments were inserted into bacterial suspensions. Controls included uncoated stent segments and stents coated with placebo SRV (without CHX). RESULTS: Bacterial growth measured as turbidity and as colony-forming units showed a significant inhibition effect of initial bacteria adhesion to the CHX-SRV coated stent segments compared with the controls (P<0.001). This inhibitory effect was apparent in each of the bacteria tested and was confirmed by inspection of the stent segments under an electron microscope. In a kinetic experiment using CHX 2% SRV, we were able to prolong the growth inhibition effect from 1 week to nearly 2 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: We believe this technique may play a significant role in reducing ureteral stent-associated UTIs. Further studies are needed before this approach can be implemented in clinical practice.
TI  - Identification and imaging of peptides and proteins on Enterococcus faecalis biofilms by matrix assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry.
AB  - The heptapeptide ARHPHPH was identified from biofilms and planktonic cultures of  two different strains of Enterococcus faecalis, V583 and ATCC 29212, using matrix assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS). ARHPHPH was also imaged at the boundary of cocultured, adjacent E. faecalis and Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922) biofilms, appearing only on the E. faecalis side. ARHPHPH was proteolyzed from kappa-casein, a component in the growth media, by E. faecalis microbes. Additionally, top down and bottom up proteomic approaches were combined to identify and spatially locate multiple proteins within intact E. faecalis V583 biofilms by MALDI-MS. The resultant tandem MS data were searched against the NCBInr E. faecalis V583 database to identify thirteen cytosolic and membrane proteins which have functional association with the cell surface. Two of these proteins, enolase and GAPDH, are glycolytic enzymes known to display multiple functions in bacterial virulence in related bacterial strains. This work illustrates a powerful approach for discovering and localizing multiple peptides and proteins within intact biofilms.
TI  - Lack of direct effects of agrochemicals on zoonotic pathogens and fecal indicator bacteria.
AB  - Agrochemicals, fecal indicator bacteria (FIB), and pathogens frequently contaminate water simultaneously. No significant direct effects of fertilizer, atrazine, malathion, and chlorothalonil on the survival of Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Salmonella enterica, human polyomaviruses, and adenovirus were detected, supporting the assertion that previously observed effects of agrochemicals on FIB were indirect.
TI  - Killer toxin from a novel killer yeast Pichia kudriavzevii RY55 with idiosyncratic antibacterial activity.
AB  - The killer phenomenon of yeast may have technological implications in many areas  like beverage fermentation, food technology, biological control in agriculture, and in medicine. In the present study the killer phenomenon in Pichia kudriavzevii (P. kudriavzevii RY55) is being reported for the first time. The P. kudriavzevii RY55 toxin exhibited excellent antibacterial activity against several pathogens of human health significance such as Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella sp., Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas alcaligenes. Killer toxin was purified to homogeneity by using ammonium sulphate precipitation and ion exchange chromatography and characterized for few properties. P. kudriavzevii RY55 killer toxin may be of vast significance in the development of novel antimicrobial chemotherapeutic agents, new bio-based safer candidates for food preservation and biocontrol, and starter cultures for fermentation industries.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of the antimicrobial activity of a range of probiotics against pathogens: evidence for the effects of organic acids.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the antimicrobial properties of fifteen  selected strains belonging to the Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Lactococcus, Streptococcus and Bacillus genera against Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria. In vitro antibacterial activity was initially investigated by an agar spot method. Results from the agar spot test showed that most of the selected strains were able to produce active compounds on solid media with antagonistic properties against Salmonella Typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium difficile. These results were also confirmed when cell-free culture supernatants (CFCS) from the putative probiotics were used in an agar well diffusion assay. Neutralization of the culture supernatants with alkali reduced the antagonistic effects. These experiments are able to confirm the capacity of potential probiotics to inhibit selected pathogens. One of the main inhibitory mechanisms may result from the production of organic acids from glucose fermentation and consequent lowering of culture pH. This observation was confirmed when the profile of organic acids was analysed demonstrating that lactic and acetic acid were the principal end products of probiotic metabolism. Furthermore, the assessment of the haemolytic activity and the susceptibility of the strains to the most commonly used antimicrobials, considered as basic safety aspects, were also studied. The observed antimicrobial activity was mainly genus-specific, additionally significant differences could be observed among species.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of filamentous fungi isolated from highly antibiotic-contaminated river sediment.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Filamentous fungi are well known for their production of substances with antimicrobial activities, several of which have formed the basis for the development of new clinically important antimicrobial agents. Recently, environments polluted with extraordinarily high levels of antibiotics have been documented, leading to strong selection pressure on local sentinel bacterial communities. In such microbial ecosystems, where multidrug-resistant bacteria are likely to thrive, it is possible that certain fungal antibiotics have become less efficient, thus encouraging alternative strategies for fungi to compete with bacteria. METHODS: In this study, sediment of a highly antibiotic-contaminated Indian river was sampled in order to investigate the presence of cultivable filamentous fungi and their ability to produce substances with antimicrobial activity. RESULTS: Sixty one strains of filamentous fungi, predominantly various Aspergillus spp. were identified. The majority of the Aspergillus strains displayed antimicrobial activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis and Candida albicans. Bioassay-guided isolation of the secondary metabolites of A. fumigatus led to the identification of gliotoxin. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated proof of principle of using bioassay-guided isolation for finding bioactive molecules.
TI  - Can artisanal "Coalho" cheese from Northeastern Brazil be used as a functional food?
AB  - Brazilian artisanal "Coalho" cheeses from six Northeast towns were investigated as a functional food based on their peptide profiles and antioxidant, zinc-binding and antimicrobial activities. The peptides (WSP) from "Coalho" cheese showed high antioxidant activity, the best value of TEAC being 2223+/-10.10muM, which means 91.1+/-0.43% oxidative inhibition and peptide concentration for IC(50) of 7mg/mL (21mug of peptides) for sample from the town of Correntes. The smallest TEAC value (1896+/-17muM), which means 75.9+/-0.7% oxidative inhibition and IC(50) of 10.5mg/mL (31.5mug of peptide), was obtained for samples from the town of Sao Bento do Una. The zinc-binding activities were: Arcoverde (72.21+/-0.24%) Cachoeirinha (75.02+/-0.02%), Capoeiras (61.78+/-0.65%), Correntes (75.47+/-0.5%), Sao Bento do Una (75.41+/-0.15%), and Venturosa (74.36+/-0.04%). The WSP extracts showed antimicrobial activity against Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. All the results obtained suggest that "Coalho" cheese has potential as a functional food.
TI  - Effects of potato fiber and potato-resistant starch on biomarkers of colonic health in rats fed diets containing red meat.
AB  - The effects of red meat consumption with and without fermentable carbohydrates on indices of large bowel health in rats were examined. Sprague-Dawley rats were fed cellulose, potato fiber, or potato-resistant starch diets containing 12% casein for 2 wk, then similar diets containing 25% cooked beef for 6 wk. After week 8, cecal and colonic microbiota composition, fermentation end-products, colon structure, and colonocyte DNA damage were analyzed. Rats fed potato fiber had lower Bacteroides-Prevotella-Porphyromonas group compared to other diet groups. Colonic Bifidobacterium spp. and/or Lactobacillus spp. were higher in potato fiber and potato-resistant starch diets than in the cellulose diet. Beneficial changes were observed in short-chain fatty acid concentrations (acetic, butyric, and propionic acids) in rats fed potato fiber compared with rats fed cellulose. Phenol and p-cresol concentrations were lower in the cecum and colon of rats fed potato fiber. An increase in goblet cells per crypt and longer crypts were found in the colon of rats fed potato fiber and potato-resistant starch diets. Fermentable carbohydrates had no effect on colonic DNA damage. Dietary combinations of red meat with potato fiber or potato-resistant starch have distinctive effects in the large bowel. Future studies are essential to examine the efficacy of different types of nondigestible carbohydrates in maintaining colonic health during long-term consumption of high-protein diets. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Improved understanding of interactions between the food consumed and gut microbiota provides knowledge needed to make healthier food choices for large bowel health. The impact of red meat on large bowel health may be ameliorated by consuming with fermentable dietary fiber, a colonic energy source that produces less harmful by-products than the microbial breakdown of colonic protein for energy. Developing functional red meat products with fermentable dietary fiber could be one way to promote a healthy and balanced macronutrient diet.
TI  - Non-tuberculous mycobacteria and their surface lipids efficiently induced IL-17 production in human T cells.
AB  - Interleukin-17 (IL-17) is produced by a subset of CD4(+) T helper (Th) lymphocytes known as Th17 cells. In humans, IL-1beta, enhanced by IL-6 and IL-23 is crucial for differentiation of these cells. IL-17 evokes inflammation and is involved in host defence against microorganisms, although little is known about its role in diseases caused by non-tuberculous mycobacteria. The genus Mycobacterium contains both obligate and opportunistic pathogens as well as saprophytes, and the mycobacterial cell envelope is unique in its abundance of lipids. Here we investigated IL-17 and IL-23 production in human PBMC in response to intact UV-inactivated mycobacteria and mycobacterial surface lipids from two opportunistic (Mycobacterium avium and Mycobacterium abscessus) and one generally non-pathogenic (Mycobacterium gordonae) species. Representative Gram-positive (Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus mitis) and Gram-negative (Escherichia coli) bacteria were included as controls. Intact mycobacteria induced production of large amounts of IL-17, while IL-17 responses to control bacteria were negligible. Purified CD4(+) T cells, but not CD4-depleted cell fractions, produced this IL-17. Isolated mycobacterial surface lipids induced IL-17, but not IL-23 production. The ability of the non-tuberculous mycobacteria to induce IL-17 production in CD4(+) T cells was the same regardless of the pathogenic potential of the particular mycobacterial species.
TI  - Antibacterial effect of phosphates and polyphosphates with different chain length.
AB  - The aim of this study was to monitor the antibacterial effect of seven phosphate  salts on selected strains of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, which could be considered responsible for food-borne diseases (Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Citrobacter freundii, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella enterica ser. Enteritidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). For these purposes, phosphates differing in chain length were used. The tested concentrations were in the range of 0.1-2.0% (wt v(-1)) applied at the model conditions. In the majority of cases the visible inhibitory effect on the growth of observed microorganisms could be seen. Due to the chemical structure of salts and their dissociation both the pH values of cultivation broth and similarly the growth characteristics of bacterial strains were affected. The inhibition of above mentioned bacteria was apparently supported by this dissociation. Phosphates obviously made the development of most Gram-positive bacteria impossible. Especially Micrococcus luteus was extremely sensitive to the presence of these substances. On the other hand, Gram-negative bacteria seemed to be resistant to the phosphate incidence. The exemption clause from the tested salts was represented by a high alkaline trisodium phosphate. It should be pointed out that generally the most significant antibacterial effects were shown by polyphosphates HEXA68 and HEXA70, trisodium phosphate undecahydrate, tetrasodium pyrophosphate and finally trisodium phosphate. By comparing the inhibitory effects of various phosphate salts can be concluded that the antibacterial activity was not determined only by the condensation degree but there was also proved the dependence on pH values.
TI  - The antimicrobial, antioxidative, anti-inflammatory activity and cytotoxicity of  different fractions of four South African Bauhinia species used traditionally to treat diarrhoea.
AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL IMPORTANCE: Many Bauhinia species, including those indigenous to South Africa, are used in traditional medicine across the world for treating ailments such as gastrointestinal tract (GIT) disorders, diabetes, infectious diseases and inflammation. AIMS: Several relevant aspects of different fractions of leaf extracts of Bauhinia bowkeri (BAB), Bauhinia galpinii (BAG), Bauhinia petersiana (BAP), and Bauhinia variegata (BAV) used in South African traditional medicine to alleviate diarrhoea related symptoms were evaluated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The antioxidative activities of the extracts were determined using the 2, 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 2, 2'-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid (ABTS(+)) radical scavenging and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) methods. In vitro antimicrobial activities of the extracts were determined against bacterial strains (Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis) and clinical isolates of the opportunistic fungal strains (Aspergillus fumigatus, Candida albicans, and Cryptococcus neoformans) using a serial dilution microplate method. The polyphenolic contents were quantified using standard methods, and anti-inflammatory activities of the crude extracts were determined using the cyclooxygenase and soybean 15-lipoxygenase enzyme inhibitory assays. The safety of the extracts was evaluated by determining the cytotoxicity against Vero cell lines. RESULTS: The acidified 70% acetone crude extract and their fractions had good antiradical potency against the DPPH and ABTS radicals. The methanol soluble portions of the butanol fractions were more potent (EC(50) ranges from 0.64 +/- 0.05 to 1.51 +/- 0.07 and 0.88 +/- 0.18 to 1.49 +/- 0.09 mug/ml against DPPH and ABTS radical respectively) compared to the standard, trolox and ascorbic acid (EC(50) ranges from 1.47 +/- 0.24 to 1.70 +/- 0.27 mug/ml) for both DPPH and ABTS. The crude extracts contained variable quantities of phenolic content. The crude extracts and their fractions had weak to good antimicrobial activities, inhibiting the growth of the organisms at concentrations ranging from 39 to 2500 mug/ml. The BAG crude extract and its fractions were the most active against the fungi (MICs ranging from 39 to 625 mug/ml) while the BAB extract and its fractions were the least active with the MICs ranging between 39 and 2500 mug/ml. Aspergillus fumigatus was the least susceptible fungus while Cryptococcus neoformans was the most susceptible. The phenolic-rich crude extracts of BAB, BAG, and BAP had moderate to good dose-dependent cyclooxygenase-1 enzyme inhibitory activity with inhibitions between 22.8% and 71.4%. The extracts were however, inactive against cyclooxygenase-2. The extracts had some level of cytotoxicity towards Vero cell lines, reducing cell viability to less than 10% at concentrations more than 50 mug/ml. CONCLUSION: The biological activities observed in Bauhinia species provide a scientific basis for the use of the plants in traditional medicines to treat diseases with multi-factorial pathogenesis such as diarrhoea, with each aspect of activity contributing to the ultimate therapeutic benefit of the plants. However, the use of the phenolic-rich extracts of these plants to treat diarrhoea or any other ailments in traditional medicine needs to be monitored closely because of potential toxic effects and selective inhibition of COX-1 with the associated GIT injury.
TI  - Chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oil of Linum pubescens growing wild in Jordan.
AB  - The volatile constituents of the aerial flowering parts of Linum pubescens were collected by hydro-distillation and analysed by GC and GC/MS. Analysis allowed the identification of 68 components of which, geranyl isovalerate (18.93%), lauric acid (12.07%), germacrene D (10.61%), decanoic acid (8.07%), 6,10,14-trimethyl-2-pentadecanone (5.02%) and 1-hexanol (4.99%) were detected as major constituents. The isolated essential oil of the plant exhibited high antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus cereus ATCC11778, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 2923) and showed moderate antimicrobial activity against Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 13048 and Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 10031).
TI  - The effect of tissue inhibitors on the antibacterial activity of chitosan nanoparticles and photodynamic therapy.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Newer antibacterial alternatives such as chitosan nanoparticles (CSnps) and photodynamic therapy (PDT) have been investigated to achieve effective root canal disinfection. The current study aims to assess the effect of various tissue inhibitors such as dentin, dentin matrix, pulp tissue, bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPSs), and bovine serum albumin (BSA) on the antibacterial activity of CSnps and PDT. METHODS: The antibacterial effect of CSnps and PDT using photosensitizers, rose bengal (RB), and methylene blue (MB) were tested on planktonic Enterococcus faecalis American Type Culture Collection 29212 with or without pretreatment using different tissue inhibitors for an hour. Bacterial survival was assessed after 1, 8, and 24 hours of incubation with CSnps and after PDT using RB and MB. RESULTS: Pulp and BSA inhibited the antibacterial effect of CSnps significantly (P < .05). The antibacterial effect of CSnps was not affected by dentin, dentin matrix, or LPSs. The antibacterial activity of PDT using MB and RB was inhibited in a decreasing order by dentin matrix, BSA, pulp, dentin, and LPSs (P < .05). The effect of tissue inhibitors was higher in the case of PDT with RB. Depending on the antibacterial mechanism of CSnps and PDT, different inhibitory patterns were observed with different tissue inhibitors. CONCLUSIONS: The tissue inhibitors existing within the root canal affected the antibacterial activity of CSnps and PDT at varying degrees. Further research is required to enhance their antimicrobial efficacy in an endodontic environment.
TI  - Microbiological profile of orbital abscess.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Knowledge of the culture and sensitivity pattern is necessary, for the institution of appropriate empirical antibiotic therapy in orbital abscess. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to describe culture and sensitivity patterns of specimens from the orbit and surrounding structures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospectively the medical records of 56 cases of orbital abscess were reviewed. RESULTS: Cultures were positive in 38/56 (68.8%) orbital specimens and the organisms included Staphylococcus aureus 18, Streptococci 7, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 3, 2 each of Enterobactersp, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Acinetobacter sp. and 1 each of Actinomyces israelii, Diptheroids, Coagulase negative Staphylococcus, Citrobacter freundii, Methicillin-resistant S. aureus and Enterococcus faecalis. Four had polymicrobial infection. Culture of purulent nasal discharge, swabs taken from foci of infection on the face, and blood cultures were done in 26/56, and positive cultures were obtained in 16/26 (61.5%) specimens. In 12 patients, there was a concurrence in the organism cultured from the orbit and from cultures from other sites. Gram-negative organisms were associated with increased ocular morbidity. CONCLUSION: Gram-positive cocci, especially S. aureus are the most common organisms isolated from orbital abscesses. Infections by Gram-negative organisms were associated with more complications. Empirical intravenous antibiotic therapy should have a broad spectrum of activity effective against a wide range of Staphylococcal organisms and Gram-negative bacilli.
TI  - The constituents of essential oil: antimicrobial and antioxidant activity of Micromeria congesta Boiss. & Hausskn. ex Boiss. from East Anatolia.
AB  - The chemical composition, antimicrobial activity, total phenol content, total antioxidant activity, and total oxidant status of the essential oil from Micromeria congesta Boiss. & Hausskn. ex Boiss. were investigated. Steam distillation was used to obtain the essential oil, and the chemical analyses were performed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The antimicrobial activity was tested by an agar disc diffusion method against the tested microorganisms: Bacillus subtilis NRRL B-744, Bacillus cereus NRRL B-3711, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 12598, S. aureus ATCC 25923, S. aureus ATCC 25933, Escherichia coli 0157H7, E. coli ATCC25922, Micrococcus luteus NRLL B-4375, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 19433, Proteus vulgaris RSKK 96026, and Yersinia enterecolitica RSKK 1501. The major compounds found in volatiles of M. congesta were piperitone oxide, linalool oxide, veratrole, pulegone, dihydro carvone, naphthalene, iso-menthone, para-menthone, and cyclohexanone. Compared to that of reference antibiotics, the antibacterial activity of the essential oil is considered as significant. Results showed that M. congesta has the potential for being used in food and medicine depending on its antioxidant and antibacterial activity.
TI  - Effect of freezing on photoreactivation of Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - The effect of freezing on photoreactivation of two strains of Escherichia coli (ATCC strain 25922 and O157:H7 strain 961019) and two strains of Enterococcus faecalis (strain ATCC 51299, vancomycin-resistant and strain ATCC 29212, vancomycin-sensitive) following ultraviolet irradiation were examined. The level of log photoreactivation of the freezing treated test organisms (frozen at -7, -15, or -30 degrees C then thawed at room temperature prior to ultraviolet irradiation) was compared with that of the samples that had not been frozen. Freezing had obvious impact on the response of the test organisms to visible light following ultraviolet irradiation. Significantly lower levels of photoreactivation were observed in the freezing treated cells. The effect of freezing on the ability of the test microbes to photoreactivate seems to be strain and species dependent. Overall, the experimental results suggest that less photoreactivation could be expected if freezing is used as a treatment method prior to ultraviolet disinfection.
TI  - The influences of natural zeolite (cliptinolite) on ammonia and biogenic amine formation by foodborne pathogen.
AB  - The influence of natural zeolite on biogenic amines (BAs) and ammonia (AMN) production by eight common gram negative and positive foodborne pathogens (FBP) were investigated in histidine decarboxylase broth (HDB). Presence of 1% zeolite in the HDB resulted in significantly higher AMN production. Histamine (HIS) production by gram positive bacteria was as low as 0.5 mg/L, whereas Escherichia coli produced 18.96 mg/L of HIS. The use of zeolite also significantly suppressed HIS accumulation by E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, S. paratyphi A (P < 0.05), although zeolite addition stimulated HIS production by K. pneumonia and Aeromonas hydrophila. The range of tyramine (TYR) production by gram positive bacteria was 1.19 and 4.06 mg/L for Enteroccus faecalis and Listeria monocytogenes respectively. The results of study showed that the effect of zeolite on BAs and AMN production was dependent on bacterial strains, as well as zeolite concentrations used. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Natural zeolites are the main absorptive, low-cost material used in agriculture and industry. Although the effect of zeolite on ammonia formation in some industrial systems is well known, there is limited information regarding the impact of zeolite on biogenic amine (BA) production by foodborne pathogens. The data presented in this article will help us to understand the impact of natural zeolite on BA and ammonia production by eight common foodborne pathogens.
TI  - Stimulation of cadaverine production by foodborne pathogens in the presence of Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, and Streptococcus spp.
AB  - The effect of Lactobacillus plantarum (FI8595), Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris MG 1363), Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (IL 1403), and Streptococcus thermophilus on cadaverine and other biogenic amine production by foodborne pathogens was investigated lysine decarboxylase broth. Both of lactic acid bacteria and foodborne pathogens used (especially Staphylococcus aureus, E. coli, Lc. lactis subsp. lactis and Lb. plantarum) had an ability to convert aminoacids into biogenic amine. The conversion of lysine into cadaverine was the highest (167.11 mg/L) by Lactobacillus spp. Gram-positive bacteria generally had a greater ability to produce cadaverine with corresponding value of 46.26, 53.76, and 154.54 mg/L for Enterococcus faecalis, S. aureus, and Listeria monocytogenes, respectively. Significant variations on biogenic amine production were observed in the presence of lactic acid bacteria strains (P < 0.05). The role of lactic acid bacteria on biogenic amine production by foodborne pathogens varied depending on strains and specific amine. Cadaverine accumulation by Enterobactericeae was increased in the presence of lactic acid bacteria strains except for St. thermophilus, which induced 2-fold lower cadaverine production by S. Paratyphi A. Lc. lactis subsp. lactis and Lc. lactis subsp. cremoris induced 10-fold higher increases in histamine for E. coli and K. pneumoniae, respectively. Lactic acid bacteria resulted in strong increases in cadaverine production by P. aeruginosa, although remarkable decreases were observed for histamine, spermidine, dopamine, agmatine, and TMA in the presence of lactic acid bacteria in lysine decarboxylase broth . The result of the study showed that amine positive lactic acid bacteria strains in fermented food led to significant amine accumulation by contaminant bacteria and their accumulation in food product may be controlled by the use of proper starters with amine-negative activity.
TI  - Standardization of isothermal microcalorimetry in urinary tract infection detection by using artificial urine.
AB  - PURPOSE: Isothermal microcalorimetry (IMC) has recently been reported as a new method to rapidly detect urinary tract pathogens (UTP). However, further application of microcalorimetry in the clinical setting requires a standardized procedure. An important step toward such standardization is to use a reproducible growth medium. In this study, we investigated the potential of artificial urine in combination with microcalorimetry for detection of common UTP. METHODS: A microcalorimeter equipped with 48 channels was used. Detection was accomplished, and growth was monitored for four bacterial strains in artificial urine at 37 degrees C by measuring metabolic heat flow (muW = muJ/s) as a function of time. The strains were Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus aureus. RESULT: Bacterial growth was detected after 3-32 h with decreasing inoculums down to 1 CFU. The gram-negative strains grew and were detected faster than their gram-positive counterparts. The growth rates the different strains were 0.75 +/- 0.11 for E. coli, 0.74 +/- 0.10 for E. faecalis, 1.31 +/- 0.04 for P. mirabilis, and 0.56 +/- 0.20 for S. aureus. The shape of individual heat flow curves was characteristic for each species independent of its initial concentration. CONCLUSIONS: IMC allows rapid detection of UTP in artificial urine. Clearly, different heat flow patterns enable accurate pathogen differentiation. UTP detection after only 4 h is realistic. The rapid detection of UTP tested in standardized artificial urine proves the diagnostic potential of IMC and warrants further microcalorimetric studies in the clinical setting of urinary tract infections.
TI  - An agar diffusion study comparing the antimicrobial activity of Nanoseal with some other endodontic sealers.
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of a new experimental nano-hydroxyapatite epoxy resin-based sealer (Nanoseal) with several other commercially available sealers; AH26, Tubliseal, Sealapex and Roekoseal against Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus and Escherichia coli for up to 7 days. Agar diffusion was used in this study. Fifty Muller-Hinton agar plates were prepared and divided into five experimental groups (n = 10), for each micro-organism. Another 10 agar plates were used as positive and negative controls. Endodontic sealers were tested against each micro-organism. Inhibition zones produced were recorded. The results of this study showed that all test materials exhibited inhibition zones towards the tested micro-organisms for 7 days except for Roekoseal, which showed no inhibition zones. Nanoseal and AH26 exhibited similar zones of inhibition. Significant difference was found between Nanoseal and the other tested sealers (P < 0.001).
TI  - Polymicrobial peritonitis following colonoscopic polypectomy in a peritoneal dialysis patient.
AB  - Patients undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) are at an increased risk of peritonitis following colonoscopy with or without polypectomy. Guidelines for peritoneal dialysis patients recommend administration of prophylactic antibiotics and drainage of the abdomen before colonoscopy. In this report, we describe a 53-year-old woman on CAPD who underwent colonoscopy with polypectomy and developed peritonitis within 24 hours. She presented with severe abdominal pain, typical rebounding tenderness, and turbid dialysate containing increased white blood cells with a predominance of neutrophils. A culture of the patient's peritoneal fluid grew polymicrobial species including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterococcus faecalis. She was treated with intraperitoneal and intravenous administration of combination antibiotics, and she fully recovered within 3 weeks. We suggest that nephrologists and endoscopists should be familiar with the risks and follow the guidelines to prevent such complications in CAPD patients. If peritonitis occurs, medical therapy with antibiotics should be considered before surgical intervention for catheter salvage.
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial activities of oximes derived from O-benzylhydroxylamine as FabH inhibitors.
AB  - Forty-three oxime derivatives were synthesized by allowing O-benzylhydroxylamines to react with primary benzaldehydes or salicylaldehydes; these products were gauged as potential inhibitors of beta-ketoacyl-(acyl-carrier-protein) synthase III (FabH). Among the 43 compounds, 38 are reported herein for the first time. These compounds were assayed for antimicrobial activities against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis. Compounds with prominent antibacterial activities were tested for their E. coli FabH inhibitory activities. 3-((2,4-Dichlorobenzyloxyimino)methyl)benzaldehyde O-2,4-dichlorobenzyl oxime (44) showed the best antibacterial activity, with minimum inhibitory concentrations of 3.13-6.25 mug mL(-1) against the tested bacterial strains, exhibiting the best E. coli FabH inhibitory activity, with an IC(50) value of 1.7 mM. Docking simulations were performed to position compound 44 into the E. coli FabH active site in order to determine the most probable binding conformation.
TI  - Fecal indicator bacteria transport and deposition in saturated and unsaturated porous media.
AB  - Beach sediment and sand are recognized as nonpoint fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) sources capable of causing water quality and health risks for beach-goers. A comprehensive understanding of the key factors and mechanisms governing the migration and exchange of FIB between beach water column and sediment is desired to better predict FIB concentration variations and assess the associated risk. The transport and retention behavior of two model FIB Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis) and Escherichia coli (E. coli) was examined using packed-bed columns in both saturated and unsaturated porous media to evaluate FIB migration potentials at conditions simulating the coastal aquatic environment. Additionally, complementary cell characterization techniques were conducted to better understand the migration behaviors of both FIB strains observed in the column experiments. The mobility of the gram-positive species E. faecalis was much more sensitive to solution chemistry and column saturation level than that of the gram-negative species E. coli. Interaction energy calculations suggest that E. faecalis retention was largely governed by the combination of DLVO (Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek) and non-DLVO (most likely hydrophobic and/or polymer bridging) interactions in saturated porous media, while the combination of DLVO and steric interactions controlled the deposition of E. coli cells. The measured surface properties of the two FIB strains supported the distinct bacteria transport behaviors and the differences of the identified mechanisms for each strain. As a result, E. faecalis showed the least affinity to sand in freshwater and appeared to be irreversibly attached in primary energy minima at elevated salt conditions; whereas the retained E. coli cells were reversibly attached and mostly associated with the secondary energy minima at both freshwater and seawater conditions. In unsaturated porous media, E. faecalis cells seemed to prefer to attachment at air/water interface rather than sand surface, while E. coli showed a similar affinity to the two interfaces. It was proposed that the different surface characteristics of the two FIB strains resulted in the distinct transport and retention behavior in porous media. These results highlight the need for FIB management to consider variations in transport behavior between model FIB when assessing water quality and associated risks.
TI  - Nonculture-based identification of bacteria in milk by protein fingerprinting.
AB  - Traditional methods for bacterial identification include Gram staining, culturing, and biochemical assays for phenotypic characterization of the causative organism. These methods can be time-consuming because they require in vitro cultivation of the microorganisms. Recently, however, it has become possible to obtain chemical profiles for lipids, peptides, and proteins that are present in an intact organism, particularly now that new developments have been made for the efficient ionization of biomolecules. MS has therefore become the state-of-the-art technology for microorganism identification in microbiological clinical diagnosis. Here, we introduce an innovative sample preparation method for nonculture-based identification of bacteria in milk. The technique detects characteristic profiles of intact proteins (mostly ribosomal) with the recently introduced MALDI Sepsityper(TM) Kit followed by MALDI-MS. In combination with a dedicated bioinformatics software tool for databank matching, the method allows for almost real-time and reliable genus and species identification. We demonstrate the sensitivity of this protocol by experimentally contaminating pasteurized and homogenized whole milk samples with bacterial loads of 10(3) -10(8) colony-forming units (cfu) of laboratory strains of Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus aureus. For milk samples contaminated with a lower bacterial load (10(4) cfu mL(-1) ), bacterial identification could be performed after initial incubation at 37 degrees C for 4 h. The sensitivity of the method may be influenced by the bacterial species and count, and therefore, it must be optimized for the specific application. The proposed use of protein markers for nonculture-based bacterial identification allows for high-throughput detection of pathogens present in milk samples. This method could therefore be useful in the veterinary practice and in the dairy industry, such as for the diagnosis of subclinical mastitis and for the sanitary monitoring of raw and processed milk products.
TI  - Evaluation of a therapeutic vaccine for the prevention of recurrent urinary tract infections versus prophylactic treatment with antibiotics.
AB  - INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS: Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are considered the most common bacterial infections, especially in women. The objective of this study was to evaluate the use of the sublingual bacterial vaccine Uromune(R) in order to prevent recurrent UTIs (RUTIs). METHODS: This study was conceived as a multicenter observational study. The clinical history of 319 women who presented at least 2 episodes of UTI in the last 6 months or 3 in 12 months was reviewed. Data related to treatment and clinical evolution were recorded and analyzed. A total of 159 patients received prophylactic treatment with Uromune(R) for a period of 3 months (group A) and 160 with sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim 200/40 mg/day for a period of 6 months (group B). Uromune(R) contained an inactivated bacterial cell suspension of selected strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, and Enterococcus faecalis. RESULTS: Patients in group A experienced a highly significant reduction in the number of infections compared to patients in group B. In the first 3 months, the mean number of infections was 0.36 versus 1.60 (P < 0.0001), respectively. A significant reduction was also observed after 9 and 15 months (P < 0.0001). The numbers of patients who did not have any UTI at 3, 9, and 15 months were 101, 90, and 55 in group A versus 9, 4, and 0 in group B (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: The results obtained in this study favor the use of this bacterial-based therapeutic vaccine as an effective strategy to reduce frequency, duration, severity, and costs of RUTIs.
TI  - Evidence for occurrence, persistence, and growth potential of Escherichia coli and enterococci in Hawaii's soil environments.
AB  - High densities of Escherichia coli and enterococci are common in freshwaters on Oahu and other Hawaiian Islands. Soil along stream banks has long been suspected as the likely source of these bacteria; however, the extent of their occurrence and distribution in a wide range of soils remained unknown until the current investigation. Soil samples representing the seven major soil associations were collected on the island of Oahu and analyzed for fecal coliforms, E. coli, and enterococci by the most probable number method. Fecal coliforms, E. coli, and enterococci were found in most of the samples analyzed; log mean densities (MPN +/- SE g soil(-)(1)) were 1.96 +/- 0.18, n=61; 1.21 +/- 0.17, n=57; and 2.99 +/- 0.12, n=62, respectively. Representative, presumptive cultures of E. coli and enterococci collected from the various soils were identified and further speciated using the API scheme; at least six species of Enterococcus, including Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium, were identified. In mesocosm studies, E. coli and enterococci increased by 100-fold in 4 days, after mixing sewage-spiked soil (one part) with autoclaved soil (nine parts). E. coli remained metabolically active in the soil and readily responded to nutrients, as evidenced by increased dehydrogenase activity. Collectively, these findings indicate that populations of E. coli and enterococci are part of the natural soil microflora, potentially influencing the quality of nearby water bodies.
TI  - Monitoring of antibiotic resistance in bacteria isolated from laboratory animals.
AB  - The drug resistance of microorganisms isolated from laboratory animals never treated with antibiotics is being reported consistently, while the number of laboratory animals used in medicine, pharmacy, veterinary medicine, agriculture, nutrition, and environmental and health science has increased rapidly in Korea. Therefore, this study examined the development of antimicrobial resistance in bacteria isolated from laboratory animals bred in Korea. A total of 443 isolates (7 species) containing 5 Sphingomonas paucimobilis, 206 Escherichia coli, 60 Staphylococcus aureus, 15 Staphylococcus epidermidis, 77 Enterococcus faecalis, 27 Citrobacter freundii, 35 Acinetobacter baumannii were collected from the nose, intestine, bronchus and reproductive organs of ICR mice and SD rats. Of these species, Acinetobacter baumannii and Enterococcus faecalis showed significant antimicrobial resistance according to the minimum inhibition concentration (MIC) in E-test. In case of Acinetobacter baumannii, several isolates showed MIC values 16-128 microg/mL for cefazolin and cefoxitin, and higher resistance (128-512 microg/mL) to nitrofurantoin than that of standard type. Resistance to cefazolin, cefoxitin and nitrofurantoin was detected in 17.14, 20.00, and 8.57% of the Acinetobacter baumannii isolates, respectively. In addition, 44.1% of the Enterococcus faecalis isolates collected from the laboratory animals were resistant to oxacillin concentration of 16-32 microg/mL range, while MIC value of standard type was below oxacillin concentration of 6 microg/mL. These results suggest that in rodent species of laboratory animals, Acinetobacter baumannii are resistance to cefazolin, cefoxitin and nitrofurantoin, whereas those of Enterococcus faecalis were resistance to oxacillin.
TI  - Nosocomial infections in a pediatric intensive care unit of a developing country: NHSN surveillance.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to determine the epidemiology of the three most common nosocomial infections (NI), namely, sepsis, pneumonia, and urinary tract infection (UTI), in a pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) in a developing country and to define the risk factors associated with NI. METHODS: We performed a prospective study on the incidence of NI in a single PICU, between August 2009 and August 2010. Active surveillance by National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) was conducted in the unit and children with NI (cases) were compared with a group (matched controls) in a case-control fashion. RESULTS: We analyzed 172 patients; 22.1% had NI, 71.1% of whom acquired it in the unit. The incidence densities of sepsis, pneumonia, and UTI per 1,000 patients/day were 17.9, 11.4, and 4.3, respectively. The most common agents in sepsis were Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli (18% each); Staphylococcus epidermidis was isolated in 13% of cases. In pneumonias Staphylococcus aureus was the most common cause (3.2%), and in UTI the most frequent agents were yeasts (33.3%). The presence of NI was associated with a long period of hospitalization, use of invasive devices (central venous catheter, nasogastric tube), and use of antibiotics. The last two were independent factors for NI. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of NI acquired in this unit was high and was associated with extrinsic factors.
TI  - Type I and Type II mechanisms of antimicrobial photodynamic therapy: an in vitro  study on gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (APDT) employs a non-toxic photosensitizer (PS) and visible light, which in the presence of oxygen produce reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as singlet oxygen ((1) O(2), produced via Type II mechanism) and hydroxyl radical (HO(.), produced via Type I mechanism). This study examined the relative contributions of (1) O(2) and HO(.) to APDT killing of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. STUDY DESIGN/MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fluorescence probes, 3'-(p-hydroxyphenyl)-fluorescein (HPF) and singlet oxygen sensor green reagent (SOSG) were used to determine HO(.) and (1) O(2) produced by illumination of two PS: tris-cationic-buckminsterfullerene (BB6) and a conjugate between polyethylenimine and chlorin(e6) (PEI-ce6). Dimethylthiourea is a HO(.) scavenger, while sodium azide (NaN(3)) is a quencher of (1) O(2). Both APDT and killing by Fenton reaction (chemical generation of HO(.)) were carried out on Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis) and Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). RESULTS: Conjugate PEI-ce6 mainly produced (1) O(2) (quenched by NaN(3)), while BB6 produced HO(.) in addition to (1) O(2) when NaN(3) potentiated probe activation. NaN(3) also potentiated HPF activation by Fenton reagent. All bacteria were killed by Fenton reagent but Gram-positive bacteria needed a higher concentration than Gram-negatives. NaN(3) potentiated Fenton-mediated killing of all bacteria. The ratio of APDT killing between Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria was 2 or 4:1 for BB6 and 25:1 for conjugate PEI-ce6. There was a NaN(3) dose-dependent inhibition of APDT killing using both PEI-ce6 and BB6 against Gram-negative bacteria while NaN(3) almost failed to inhibit killing of Gram-positive bacteria. CONCLUSION: Azidyl radicals may be formed from NaN(3) and HO(.). It may be that Gram-negative bacteria are more susceptible to HO(.) while Gram-positive bacteria are more susceptible to (1) O(2). The differences in NaN(3) inhibition may reflect differences in the extent of PS binding to bacteria (microenvironment) or differences in penetration of NaN(3) into cell walls of bacteria.
TI  - Marked elevation of interferon-gamma in acute focal bacterial nephritis.
AB  - Acute focal bacterial nephritis (AFBN) is a localized, interstitial bacterial infection of the renal parenchyma. In this study, we measured the serum levels of several cytokines in patients with AFBN. A total of 11 children were enrolled in the study and classified into two groups of patients: an AFBN group and a control group. There was no significant difference in the serum levels of interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, IL-17, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, or tumor necrosis factor-alpha among the patients in the two groups. However, the serum levels of interferon-gamma among the patients in the AFBN group were significantly higher than those among the patients in the control group. The current results suggest that the bacterial kidney infection in the AFBN group is localized and that interferon-gamma may be produced locally in response to the infection.
TI  - Exploring optimization parameters to increase ssDNA recombineering in Lactococcus lactis and Lactobacillus reuteri.
AB  - Single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) recombineering is a technology which is used to make  subtle changes in the chromosome of several bacterial genera. Cells which express a single-stranded DNA binding protein (RecT or Bet) are transformed with an oligonucleotide which is incorporated via an annealing and replication-dependent mechanism. By in silico analysis we identified ssDNA binding protein homologs in the genus Lactobacillus and Lactococcus lactis. To assess whether we could further improve the recombineering efficiency in Lactobacillus reuteri ATCC PTA 6475 we expressed several RecT homologs in this strain. RecT derived from Enterococcus faecalis CRMEN 19 yielded comparable efficiencies compared with a native RecT protein, but none of the other proteins further increased the recombineering efficiency. We successfully improved recombineering efficiency 10-fold in L. lactis by increasing oligonucleotide concentration combined with the use of oligonucleotides containing phosphorothioate-linkages (PTOs). Surprisingly, neither increased oligonucleotide concentration nor PTO linkages enhanced recombineering in L. reuteri 6475. To emphasize the utility of this technology in improving probiotic features we modified six bases in a transcriptional regulatory element region of the pdu-operon of L. reuteri 6475, yielding a 3-fold increase in the production of the antimicrobial compound reuterin. Directed genetic modification of lactic acid bacteria through ssDNA recombineering will simplify strain improvement in a way that, when mutating a single base, is genetically indistinguishable from strains obtained through directed evolution.
TI  - Characterization of the antibacterial activity and the chemical components of the volatile oil of the leaves of Rubus parvifolius L.
AB  - Rubus parvifolius L. (Rp) is a medicinal herb that possesses antibacterial activity. In this study, we extracted the volatile oil from the leaves of Rp to assess its antibacterial activity and analyze its chemical composition. A uniform distribution design was used to optimize the extraction procedure, which yielded 0.36% (w/w) of light yellowish oil from the water extract of Rp leaves. We found that the extracted oil effectively inhibited the growth of a wide range of Gram positive and negative bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumanii, Bacillus cloacae, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. We further analyzed the components contained in the hydro-distillated Rp volatile oil by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy. Twenty nine compounds were identified, including 4-hydroxy-3-methoxystyrene (66%), 3,7,11,15-tetramethyl-2-hexadecen-1-ol (10%) and 4-tert-butylbenzoic acid (2%). Our results suggest that one or multiple constituents contained in Rp volatile oil may account for its antibacterial activity.
TI  - The variability of bacterial aerosol in poultry houses depending on selected factors.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study is aimed at evaluation of bacterial air contamination in intensive poultry breeding. The evaluation was based on the determined levels of bacterial concentrations and qualitative identification of isolated microorganisms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study covered 5 poultry houses: two hatcheries and three hen houses with the litter bed system. The air was sampled in three measurement series in the central part of the investigated workplace at the height of about 1.5 m over the ground, using portable measuring sets consisting of a GilAir 5 (Sensidyne, USA) pump and a measuring head filled with a glass microfibre filter (Whatman, UK). For the quantitative and qualitative analysis of microorganisms were used appropriate microbiological media. RESULTS: The total concentrations of airborne mesophilic bacteria inside the poultry breeding houses ranged from 4.74 x 10(4) cfu/m(3) to 1.89 x 10(8) cfu/m(3). For Gram-negative bacteria, the range comprised the values from 4.33 x 10(2) cfu/m(3) to 4.29 x 10(6) cfu/m(3). The concentrations of the cocci of Enterococcus genus ranged from 1.53 x 10(4) cfu/m(3) to 1.09 x 10(7) cfu/m(3), whereas those of other Gram-positive bacteria from 3.78 x 10(4) cfu/m(3) to 6.65 x 10(7) cfu/m(3). The lowest concentrations of each group of the examined microorganisms were noted in the second measurement series when the air exchange in the breeding houses was over twice higher than in first and third measurement series because the mechanical ventilation was supported by natural ventilation (opened gates in the buildings). The lowest concentrations of total bacteria were obtained in those buildings where one-day old chickens were kept. Gram-positive bacteria of the genera: Staphylococcus, Enterococcus, Corynebacterium, Brevibacterium, Micrococcus, Cellulomonas, Bacillus, Aerococcus, and Gram-negative bacteria of the genera: Pseudomonas, Moraxella, Escherichia, Enterobacter, Klebsiella, Pasteurella, Pantoea were isolated. It was shown that for most of the investigated livestock premises the total bacteria concentrations exceeded the reference value of 1.0 x 10(5) cfu/m(3). Furthermore, pathogenic microorganisms which are a potential threat to human health (Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae ssp. ozaenae, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium) were found among the identified bacteria. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that the hygienic conditions of the working environment connected with litter bed system production of poultry are affected by changes of the efficiency of ventilation and create a direct health risk to employees. They should use personal protective measures to protect their respiratory tract, especially when the gates in the hen houses are closed.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antimicrobial activity of propolis on the microbiota from gastrointestinal tract of chickens.
AB  - The aim of this study was to examine the effect of propolis extracts on the microbial colonization of chicken gastrointestinal tract in vivo. The propolis was administered to both feed mixtures in various amounts except of the control group. The addition of 150 mg propolis to 1 kg of feed was included in the first experimental group, the addition of 450 mg.kg(-1) in the second experimental group, the addition of 600 mg.kg(-1) the third experimental group and 800 mg kg(-1) in the fourth one. The highest count of faecal enterococci was found in the third group (8.6 cfu.g(-1)) where 600 mg of propolis to 1 kg was added to the feed mixture. The highest count of lactobacilli was detected in the fourth experimental group (8.83 cfu.g(-1)) where was 800 mg of propolis added to 1 kg of feed mixture and number of Enterobacteriaceae genera count was found in control group (8.73 cfu.g(-1)). With RTQ PCR detected species from the genus Enterococcus were: E. avium, E. casseliflavus, E cecorum, E. faecalis, E. faecium, E. gallinarum, E. hirae and E. malodoratus and from genus Lactobacillus were: Lactobacillus crispatus, L. acidophilus and L. salivarius. With MALDI TOF MS Biotyper from Enterobacteriaceae genera were identified Citrobacter braakii, Raoultella ornithinolytica, Serratia fonticola, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella oxytoca. Antimicrobial activities In vitro of six species of bacteria isolated from gastrointestinal tract of chickens were also tested. The best antimicrobial effect of Citrobacter braakii on ethanolic propolis extract in all concentrations were found.
TI  - The role of asymptomatic bacteriuria in young women with recurrent urinary tract  infections: to treat or not to treat?
AB  - BACKGROUND: Little is known about the role of asymptomatic bacteriuria (AB) treatment in young women affected by recurrent urinary tract infection (UTI). We aimed to evaluate the impact of AB treatment on the recurrence rate among young women affected by recurrent UTI. METHODS: A total of 673 consecutive asymptomatic young women with demonstrated bacteriuria from January 2005 to December 2009 were prospectively enrolled. Patients were split into 2 groups: not treated (group A, n = 312) and treated (group B, n = 361). Microbiological and clinical evaluations were performed at 3, 6, and 12 months. Quality of life was also measured. Recurrence-free rate at the end of the entire study period was the main outcome measure. RESULTS: At baseline, the 2 most commonly isolated pathogens were Escherichia coli (group A, 38.4%; group B, 39.3%) and Enterococcus faecalis (group A, 32.7%; group B, 33.2%). At the first follow-up visit, there was no difference between the 2 groups (relative risk [RR], 1.05; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01-1.10), whereas after 6 months, 23 (7.6%) in group A and 98 (29.7%) in group B showed recurrence with a statistically significant difference (RR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.21-1.42; P < .0001). At the last follow-up, 41 (13.1%) in group A and 169 (46.8%) in group B showed recurrence (RR, 3.17; 95% CI, 2.55-3.90; P < .0001). One patient in group A and 2 patients in group B were found to have pyelonephritis. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that AB should not be treated in young women affected by UTI, suggesting it may play a protective role in preventing symptomatic recurrence.
TI  - Evaluation of impact of exposure of Sudan azo dyes and their metabolites on human intestinal bacteria.
AB  - Sudan azo dyes are banned for food usage in most countries, but they are illegally used to maintain or enhance the color of food products due to low cost, bright staining, and wide availability of the dyes. In this report, we examined the toxic effects of these azo dyes and their potential reduction metabolites on 11 prevalent human intestinal bacterial strains. Among the tested bacteria, cell growth of 2, 3, 5, 5, and 1 strains was inhibited by Sudan I, II, III, IV, and Para Red, respectively. At the tested concentration of 100 muM, Sudan I and II inhibited growth of Clostridium perfringens and Lactobacillus rhamnosus with decrease of growth rates from 14 to 47%. Sudan II also affected growth of Enterococcus faecalis. Growth of Bifidobacterium catenulatum, C. perfringens, E. faecalis, Escherichia coli, and Peptostreptococcus magnus was affected by Sudan III and IV with decrease in growth rates from 11 to 67%. C. perfringens was the only strain in which growth was affected by Para Red with 47 and 26% growth decreases at 6 and 10 h, respectively. 1-Amino-2-naphthol, a common metabolite of the dyes, was capable of inhibiting growth of most of the tested bacteria with inhibition rates from 8 to 46%. However, the other metabolites of the dyes had no effect on growth of the bacterial strains. The dyes and their metabolites had less effect on cell viability than on cell growth of the tested bacterial strains. Clostridium indolis and Clostridium ramosum were the only two strains with about a 10 % decrease in cell viability in the presence of Sudan azo dyes. The present results suggested that Sudan azo dyes and their metabolites potentially affect the human intestinal bacterial ecology by selectively inhibiting some bacterial species, which may have an adverse effect on human health.
TI  - The antimicrobial activity of the appetite peptide hormone ghrelin.
AB  - The present study examined the antimicrobial activity of the peptide ghrelin. Both major forms of ghrelin, acylated ghrelin (AG) and desacylated ghrelin (DAG), demonstrated the same degree of bactericidal activity against Gram-negative Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa), while bactericidal effects against Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis) were minimal or absent, respectively. To elucidate the bactericidal mechanism of AG and DAG against bacteria, we monitored the effect of the cationic peptides on the zeta potential of E. coli. Our results show that AG and DAG similarly quenched the negative surface charge of E. coli, suggesting that ghrelin-mediated bactericidal effects are influenced by charge-dependent binding and not by acyl modification. Like most cationic antimicrobial peptides (CAMPs), we also found that the antibacterial activity of AG was attenuated in physiological NaCl concentration (150mM). Nonetheless, these findings indicate that both AG and DAG can act as CAMPs against Gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Gender and age-dependent etiology of community-acquired urinary tract infections.
AB  - Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most frequent community-acquired infections worldwide. Escherichia coli is the most common UTI pathogen although underlying host factors such as patients' age and gender may influence prevalence of causative agents. In this study, 61 273 consecutive urine samples received over a 22-month period from outpatients clinics of an urban area of north Italy underwent microbiological culture with subsequent bacterial identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of positive samples. A total of 13 820 uropathogens were isolated and their prevalence analyzed according to patient's gender and age group. Overall Escherichia coli accounted for 67.6% of all isolates, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (8.8%), Enterococcus faecalis (6.3%), Proteus mirabilis (5.2%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2.5%). Data stratification according to both age and gender showed E. coli isolation rates to be lower in both males aged >/=60 years (52.2%), E. faecalis and P. aeruginosa being more prevalent in this group (11.6% and 7.8%, resp.), as well as in those aged </=14 years (51.3%) in whom P. mirabilis prevalence was found to be as high as 21.2%. Streptococcus agalactiae overall prevalence was found to be 2.3% although it was shown to occur most frequently in women aged between 15 and 59 years (4.1%). Susceptibility of E. coli to oral antimicrobial agents was demonstrated to be as follows: fosfomycin (72.9%), trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (72.9%), ciprofloxacin (76.8%), ampicillin (48.0%), and amoxicillin/clavulanate (77.5%). In conclusion, both patients' age and gender are significant factors in determining UTIs etiology; they can increase accuracy in defining the causative uropathogen as well as providing useful guidance to empiric treatment.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of wild mushroom extracts against clinical isolates resistant to different antibiotics.
AB  - AIMS: This work aimed to screen the antimicrobial activity of aqueous methanolic  extracts of 13 mushroom species, collected in Braganca, against several clinical isolates obtained in Hospital Center of Tras-os-Montes and Alto Douro, Portugal. METHODS AND RESULTS: Microdilution method was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC). MIC results showed that Russula delica and Fistulina hepatica extracts inhibited the growth of gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Morganella morganni and Pasteurella multocida) and gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, MRSA, Enterococcus faecalis, Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus pyogenes) bacteria. A bactericide effect of both extracts was observed in Past. multocida, Strep. agalactiae and Strep. pyogenes with MBC of 20, 10 and 5 mg ml(-)(1), respectively. Lepista nuda extract exhibited a bactericide effect upon Past. multocida at 5 mg ml(-)(1) and inhibited Proteus mirabilis at 20 mg ml(-)(1). Ramaria botrytis extract showed activity against Enterococcus faecalis and L. monocytogenes, being bactericide for Past. multocida, Strep. agalactiae (MBCs 20 mg ml(-)(1)) and Strep. pyogenes (MBC 10 mg ml(-)(1)). Leucopaxillus giganteus extract inhibited the growth of E. coli and Pr. mirabilis, being bactericide for Past. multocida, Strep. pyogenes and Strep. agalactiae. CONCLUSIONS: Fistulina hepatica, R. botrytis and R. delica are the most promising species as antimicrobial agents. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Mushroom extracts could be an alternative as antimicrobials against pathogenic micro-organisms resistant to conventional treatments.
TI  - [Skin antiseptics in plastic surgery].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Wound healing is a complex proces, which is influenced by multiple factors. Bacterial contamination and infection are frequent and severe complications. The treatment of such infected wounds is a major challenge to the plastic surgeon. The topical application of wound antiseptics is widely used as a therapeutic approach in the treatment of these wounds. This review provides an overview about their clinical application, their cytotoxic and antibacterial properties as well as interactions with commonly used wound dressings. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This article reviews current literature dealing with local antiseptics, antibacterial activity, cytotoxicity and compatibility with wound dressings. RESULTS: Topical antiseptics are used on a daily basis in order to reduce bacterial wound contamination. However, few data exist concerning their antimicrobial activity, especially in relation to their cytotoxicity. Furthermore, their compatibility with wound dressings is barely investigated. Recent studies show significant toxic effects on cells and an incompatibility with certain wound dressings for some of these antiseptics. DISCUSSION: Antiseptics are broadly used in healthcare to reduce, inactivate or eliminate bacterial pathogens. Recent studies show that many daily used antiseptics possess relevant cytotoxic properties as well as cross reactions with wound dressings. Additional studies are therefore needed to further investigate and characterize the properties of wound antiseptics in order to identify the optimal therapeutic agents for the treatment of infected wounds.
TI  - Total synthesis and biological evaluation of transvalencin Z.
AB  - The emerging global epidemic of drug-resistant tuberculosis has created an urgent need to identify novel therapeutic approaches for disease treatment. Transvalencin Z (1) is a natural product from Nocardia transvalensis with relatively potent and selective antimycobacterial activity against Mycobacterium smegmatis, making it an attractive target for structure-activity and mechanism of action studies. The total synthesis of the four possible diastereomers of transvalencin Z was completed (1a-d), and the absolute configurations were defined using chemical synthesis, HPLC retention times, and optical rotation measurements. Surprisingly, none of the transvalencin Z diastereomers exhibited any inhibitory activity against a panel of microbial pathogens, including several species of mycobacteria.
TI  - Selective grazing by protists upon enteric bacteria in an aquatic system.
AB  - It is well known that protozoan grazing can be an important agent of mortality for suspended bacteria, both in marine and freshwater environments. Considering that the presence of fecal contamination is a frequent phenomenon in triese environments, and that Escherichia coli and the genus Enterococcus are indicators of microbiological water quality, the effect of protozoan grazing on E. coli and Enterococcus faecalis in Los Padres Lagoon waters (Buenos Aires, Argentina, 37 degrees 56'30" S, 57 degrees 44'30" W) was herein analyzed. Microcosm assays were carried out, simulating lacustrine conditions, confronting suspensions of autochthonous bacterivorous protozoans with suspensions of autochthonous and collection strains of E. coli and E. faecalis, combined and individually. Daily counts were made for evaluating bacterial survival and the number of ciliates. The results obtained indicate that there is a preferential sequence for bacterial removal in the water, where E. faecalis is more grazing-resistant than E. coli. Moreover, it was noted that the origin of bacterial strains influenced their sensitivity for grazing, at least in the short term (e.g. the collection strains were less affected). We conclude that protozoan grazing can modify the relative abundance of fecal indicator microorganisms, thus altering the results of water quality studies.
TI  - Structural characterization and antimicrobial evaluation of atractyloside, atractyligenin, and 15-didehydroatractyligenin methyl ester.
AB  - We report the first complete structure elucidation of the ent-kaurane diterpenoid glycoside atractyloside (1) by means of NMR and X-ray diffractometry techniques. Extensive one- and two-dimensional NMR experiments were employed to assign the proton and carbon signals of 1, and crystallography experiments established the configurations of all stereogenic centers. Furthermore, we present a novel semisynthetic route for the preparation of the highly cytotoxic aglycone derivative of 1, 15-didehydroatractyligenin methyl ester (3). All compounds were tested for their antibiotic activity against Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, and several strains of Staphylococcus aureus, including fluoroquinolone-resistant (SA1199B) and two epidemic MRSA (EMRSA-15 and -16) strains. Compound 3 exhibited moderate activity against all of the Staph. aureus strains with an MIC value of 128 mg/L.
TI  - Urine flow cytometry as a primary screening method to exclude urinary tract infections.
AB  - PURPOSE: To exclude urinary tract infections, culture is the gold standard method, although it is time consuming and costly. Current strategies using dipstick analysis are unsatisfactory as screening methods, because of inadequate sensitivity/specificity. Urine flow cytometry is an attractive alternative. To exclude urinary tract infections, a cutoff value to screen for negative cultures was determined. METHODS: 281 outpatients (51 % male) of a general population visiting the urology department were included. Urine samples were measured by flow cytometry and compared with culture results and dipstick analysis. ROC analysis was performed to evaluate the screening performance of flow cytometry and dipstick analysis compared to culture. RESULTS: 18 % of cultures were positive, defined as >10(4) colony forming units/mL. Bacterial count by flow cytometry alone provides the best sensitivity and specificity to exclude a urinary tract infection. A cutoff value of 60 bacteria/muL urine leads to a sensitivity of 100 % and a specificity of 60 %. Retrospectively, with a cutoff value of 60 bacteria/muL urine, 49 % of the cultures would have been redundant. 20 % of patients receiving antibiotics possibly had received those unnecessarily. The calculated percentage of false negatives was 0 % (95 % confidence interval 0-3.3 %). CONCLUSIONS: Urine flow cytometry is a reliable screening method to exclude urinary tract infections. With a cutoff value of 60 bacteria/muL urine, negative predictive value is 100 % and the calculated percentage of false negatives is 0 % (95 % confidence interval 0-3.3 %). Using flow cytometry as a screening method could lead to a reduction in cultures and antibiotics.
TI  - Sensitivities of major causative organisms isolated from patients with acute uncomplicated cystitis against various antibacterial agents: results of subanalysis based on the presence of menopause.
AB  - We investigated whether the presence of menopause influenced the species and distribution of causative bacteria isolated from patients with acute uncomplicated cystitis (the most common urinary tract infection), and we also investigated the sensitivity of the isolated species to antibacterial agents. Using multivariate analysis, we also investigated risk factors for infection with quinolone-resistant Escherichia coli, because its frequency has increased and it is now a clinical problem in Japan. Six hundred and thirty-four strains were isolated from 489 premenopausal patients (mean age 32.3 +/- 10.1 years). Major causative bacteria detected were Escherichia coli (65.0 %), Enterococcus faecalis (12.0 %), Streptococcus agalactiae (5.5 %), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (1.6 %). From 501 postmenopausal patients (mean age 68.7 +/- 10.29 years), 657 strains were isolated, and the major causative bacteria detected were E. coli (61.5 %), E. faecalis (13.7 %), K. pneumoniae (5.2 %), and S. agalactiae (4.0 %). The sensitivities to fluoroquinolones (FQs) and cephems of E. coli isolated from premenopausal patients were both >/=90 %, while the sensitivities to FQs of E. coli isolated from postmenopausal patients were about 5 % lower. In regard to infection with quinolone-resistant E. coli (minimal inhibitory concentration of levofloxacin [LVFX] >/=4 mug/mL), significant risk factors were observed in patients with more than two episodes of cystitis within a year (p = 0.0002), patients to whom antibacterial agents were used previously for this episode of cystitis (p = 0.0175), and patients who had a history of FQ administration within 1 month. Although the species and distribution of causative bacteria of acute uncomplicated cystitis were the same regardless of the presence of menopause, the sensitivities to FQs of E. coli detected in postmenopausal patients were significantly lower than those in the premenopausal women. The major risk factors for infection with quinolone-resistant E. coli were a history of FQ administration and the morbidity of cystitis rather than the menopausal status. It was considered that taking an appropriate history including the morbidity of cystitis and history of FQ administration, and the appropriate selection of an antibacterial agent, would be important when empirical therapy is required.
TI  - Syntheses and biological studies of novel spiropiperazinyl oxazolidinone antibacterial agents using a spirocyclic diene derived acylnitroso Diels-Alder reaction.
AB  - Several novel oxazolidinone antibiotics with a spiropiperazinyl substituent at the 4'-position of the phenyl ring were synthesized through nitroso Diels-Alder chemistry and the in vitro antibacterial activities were evaluated against various Gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis), Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and mycobacteria (Mycobacterium vaccae, Mycobacterium tuberculosis). Analogs (8a and 12) were active against selected drug resistant microbes, like methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and had no mammalian toxicity in a Hep-2 cellular assay (CC(50) >100 muM).
TI  - Enhancing production of bio-isoprene using hybrid MVA pathway and isoprene synthase in E. coli.
AB  - The depleting petroleum reserve, increasingly severe energy crisis, and global climate change are reigniting enthusiasm for seeking sustainable technologies to replace petroleum as a source of fuel and chemicals. In this paper, the efficiency of the MVA pathway on isoprene production has been improved as follows: firstly, in order to increase MVA production, the source of the "upper pathway" which contains HMG-CoA synthase, acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase and HMG-CoA reductase to covert acetyl-CoA into MVA has been changed from Saccharomyces cerevisiae to Enterococcus faecalis; secondly, to further enhance the production of MVA and isoprene, a alanine 110 of the mvaS gene has been mutated to a glycine. The final genetic strain YJM25 containing the optimized MVA pathway and isoprene synthase from Populus alba can accumulate isoprene up to 6.3 g/L after 40 h of fed-batch cultivation.
TI  - An investigation on first-week mortality in layers.
AB  - The quality of day-old chick placement and management upon arrival have a major impact on first-week mortality (FWM) and subsequent welfare in layers. The present study investigated FWM and causes of FWM in 50 flocks of layers. Post mortem results from 983 chickens showed that 50% died from infections, whereas noninfectious causes, in particular dehydration and nephropathy with visceral gout, made up the remaining causes of mortality. Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis were identified as the most significant bacterial pathogens associated with FWM. Statistical analysis demonstrated a significant correlation between FWM and total mortality during rearing, and a model predicting total mortality in the rearing period based on FWM was established. A statistically significant correlation between FWM and uniformity of the flock was not demonstrated at 1-2 wk of age or at approximately 15 wk of age. Genetic characterization of E. coli and E. faecalis provided evidence for a polyclonal nature of these infections in affected flocks, indicating different sources of infection. Results obtained underline the importance of minimizing FWM to a level less than 1%.
TI  - Fluorescent protein vectors for promoter analysis in lactic acid bacteria and Escherichia coli.
AB  - Fluorescent reporter genes are valuable tools for real-time monitoring of gene expression in living cells. In this study we describe the construction of novel promoter-probe vectors containing a synthetic mCherry fluorescent protein gene, codon-optimized for lactic acid bacteria, divergently linked, or not, to a gene encoding the S65T and F64L variant of the green fluorescent protein. The utility of the transcriptional fusion vectors was demonstrated by the cloning of a single or two divergent promoter regions and by the quantitative evaluation of fluorescence during growth of Lactococcus lactis, Enterococcus faecalis, and Escherichia coli.
TI  - First study on antimicriobial activity and synergy between isothiocyanates and antibiotics against selected Gram-negative and Gram-positive pathogenic bacteria from clinical and animal source.
AB  - The emergence of new diseases and the resurgence of several infections that were  controlled in the past, associated with recent increase of bacterial resistance have created the necessity for more studies towards to the development of new antimicrobials and new treatment strategies. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the in vitro synergy between different classes of important glucosinolates hydrolysis products-isothiocyanates with antibiotics (gentamycin and vancomycin), against important pathogenic bacteria: Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Listeria monocytogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. A disc diffusion method was used to evaluate the antibacterial activity. The antimicrobial activity of phytochemicals and combinations between gentamycin, vancomycin and phytochemicals were quantitatively assessed by measuring the inhibitory halos. The results showed a selective antimicrobial effect of isothiocyanates, and this effect was strictly related with their chemical structure. In general the benzylisothiocyanate was the most effective compound against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus were the bacteria most affected either by the phytochemicals alone or by the combination phytochemical-antibiotic. The bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the less affected pathogen. The most important synergism detected occurred between the commercial antibiotics with benzylisothiocyanate and 2-phenylethylisothiocyanate. In conclusion, some isothiocyanates are effective inhibitors of in vitro bacterial growth, and they can act synergistically with antibiotics.
TI  - LiF Reduces MICs of Antibiotics against Clinical Isolates of Gram-Positive and Gram-Negative Bacteria.
AB  - Antibiotic resistance is an ever-growing problem yet the development of new antibiotics has slowed to a trickle, giving rise to the use of combination therapy to eradicate infections. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the combined inhibitory effect of lithium fluoride (LiF) and commonly used antimicrobials on the growth of the following bacteria: Enterococcus faecalis, Staphyloccoccus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The in vitro activities of ceftazidime, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, streptomycin, erythromycin, amoxicillin, and ciprofloxacin, doxycycline, alone or combined with LiF were performed by microdilution method. MICs were determined visually following 18-20 h of incubation at 37 degrees C. We observed reduced MICs of antibiotics associated with LiF ranging from two-fold to sixteen-fold. The strongest decreases of MICs observed were for streptomycin and erythromycin associated with LiF against Acinetobacter baumannii and Streptococcus pneumoniae. An eight-fold reduction was recorded for streptomycin against S. pneumoniae whereas an eight-fold and a sixteen-fold reduction were obtained for erythromycin against A. baumannii and S. pneumoniae. This suggests that LiF exhibits a synergistic effect with a wide range of antibiotics and is indicative of its potential as an adjuvant in antibiotic therapy.
TI  - The persistence of flood-borne pathogens on building surfaces under drying conditions.
AB  - Previous research into microbial persistence on material surfaces following flooding has produced a wide range of results due to differing experimental conditions, including the temperature and humidity conditions of the experimental material and/or surrounding air. However, investigations to identify and quantify these factors and their links to the hygrothermal properties of building materials and the transient environmental conditions are rarely reported. This paper examines the viability of bacterial species on drying material surfaces that have been saturated with water or synthetic sewage. Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis were inoculated on brick, wood, or plaster and allowed to dry at the conditions intended to mimic the remediation environments commonly found in domestic dwellings following a flood event. The inactivation rates were compared between environmental conditions, water type and the material properties of the surfaces. Significant differences were found in the declines in E. coli according to water type, the surface relative humidity and air relative humidity and between drying rates for sewage floods. Simulations using hygrothermal software were performed to illustrate the wide variation in material drying rates under different scenarios, taking into account material size, wall composition, and ventilation. The significantly differing rates of microbial death on flooded building materials under different drying regimes suggest that building simulation models can be useful tools for predicting the level and duration of microbial contamination in buildings following a flood event. A better understanding of microbial survival on drying surfaces can be used to assess the health risks to occupants in flood affected properties.
TI  - Profile of antibiotic consumption, sensitivity and resistance in an urban area of Andhra Pradesh, India.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Antibiotics are an important category of drugs in which indiscriminate use can affect the susceptibility patterns among infectious organisms, resulting in antibiotic resistance. METHODS: Data on antibiotic usage and susceptibility patterns were collected from public and private health centres in Vijayawada, Andhra Pradesh, India, through the use of questionnaires. The data collected were then coded, tabulated, computed and evaluated using statistical analysis. RESULTS: The consumption profile of the different categories of drugs used in public and private hospitals was as follows: nutrition and metabolism products 19.0%; gastrointestinal disorder-related drugs 18.5%; antibiotics 16.8%; anti-pyretics and anti-analgesics 20.6%. These drugs were found to be in high demand. Among the antibiotics, aminoglycosides (amikacin), quinolones (ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin), tetracyclines (doxycycline), penicillin (ampicillin) and sulphonamides (co-trimoxazole) were the most commonly prescribed drugs for antibiotic therapy. 46% of the culture laboratory reports were positive with the following organism profile: Escherichia coli (36%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (16%), Staphylococcus aureus (29%), Enterococcus faecalis (9%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10%). In terms of the sensitivity profile of antibacterials, amikacin (66.9%) was the only antibiotic showing sensitivity patterns, while the majority of antibiotics, such as cotrimoxazole, nalidixic acid, amoxicillin, gentamycin and norfloxacin, had acquired a resistance rate of 55.1%-80.6%. CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that indiscriminate prescription and consumption of new broad-spectrum antibiotics against sensitive organisms results in the development of antimicrobial resistance. Therefore, there is an urgent need to curb the excessive use of antibiotics in local hospitals in order to control the trend of increasing antimicrobial resistance to antibiotics.
TI  - The surface lipids of non-tuberculous mycobacteria suppress production of phagocyte activating cytokines in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells.
AB  - The genus Mycobacterium includes obligate pathogens as well as opportunistic and  non-pathogenic species ubiquitous in the environment. Mycobacteria have a unique cell wall abundant in lipids. Here we investigated cytokine production by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in response to the opportunistic mycobacteria Mycobacterium avium and Mycobacterium abscessus, the non-pathogenic Mycobacterium gordonae and extracted surface lipids from the three species. The cytokine response elicited by mycobacteria, regardless of their pathogenic potential, differed distinctly from that induced by control Gram-positive (Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus mitis) and Gram-negative (Escherichia coli) bacteria. Mycobacteria induced no IL-12 and less TNF and IFN-gamma compared with conventional Gram-positive bacteria. IL-10 was induced by all the mycobacteria and this production was partly responsible for the down-regulation of IL-12 and IFN-gamma. The capacity of the Gram-positive bacterium E. faecalis to induce IL-12, as well as TNF and IFN-gamma, in human PBMCs was strongly reduced when mycobacterial lipids were added. The mycobacterial surface lipids down-regulated the production of IL-12 and IFN-gamma without eliciting IL-10 production. Our results show that mycobacteria evade triggering production of phagocyte activating cytokines (IL-12, TNF and IFN-gamma) and that the mycobacterial cell wall surface lipids may play a significant role in this process.
TI  - Cytotoxicity and antimicrobial activity of the methanol extract and compounds from Polygonum limbatum.
AB  - The present study was designed to investigate the antimicrobial activity and the  cytotoxicity of the methanol extract (PLA) as well as fractions (PLA1-4) and compounds [cardamomin (1), (+/-)-polygohomoisoflavanone (2), (S)-(-)-pinostrobin (3), 2',4'-dihydroxy-3',6'-dimethoxychalcone (4), (2S)-(-)-5-hydroxy-6,7-dimethoxyflavanone (5), and (2S)-(-)-5,7-dimethoxyflavanone (6)] obtained from leaves of Polygonum limbatum. The microbroth dilution was used to determine the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the samples against 11 microbial strains including Candida albicans, C. krusei, C. tropicalis, Aspergillus fumigatus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (VRE), Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), S.epidermidis, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv. The sulphorhodamine B cell growth inhibition assay was used to assess the cytotoxicity of the above samples on lung A549 adenocarcinoma, breast carcinoma MCF-7, prostate carcinoma PC-3, cervical carcinoma HeLa, and the acute monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1. The results of the MIC determination indicated that, apart from fraction PLA3, all other fractions as well as PLA and compound 3 were selectively active. MIC values were noted on 100 % of the 11 tested microorganisms for fraction PLA3, 72.7 % for PLA, fraction PLA2, and compound 4, 63.6 % for PLA1, and 54.5 % for fraction PLA4. The results of the cytotoxicity assay revealed that, except for A459 cells, more than 50 % inhibition of the proliferation was obtained with each of the tested samples on at least one of the four other cell lines. IC(5)(0) values below 4 microg/mL were obtained with 1 and 4 on THP-1 cells. The overall results of the present study provided baseline information for the possible use of Polygonum limbatum as well as some of the isolated compounds for the control of cancer diseases and mostly leukemia.
TI  - Isolation and lytic activity of the Listeria bacteriophage endolysin LysZ5 against Listeria monocytogenes in soya milk.
AB  - The endolysin gene (lysZ5) from the genome of the Listeria monocytogenes phage FWLLm3 was cloned in Escherichia coli and characterized. Comparative sequence analysis revealed that lysZ5 resembled the murein hydrolase ply511 encoded by L. monocytogenes phage A511. The encoded protein LysZ5 had a predicted molecular mass of 35.8 kDa and was expressed in E. coli as an N-terminal fusion protein of 41.5 kDa. Addition of purified fusion protein to lawns of indicator bacteria showed that LysZ5 could lyse L. monocytogenes, Listeria innocua and Listeria welshimeri, but not Staphylococcus aureus or Enterococcus faecalis. The purified protein was able to kill L. monocytogenes growing in soya milk, with the pathogen concentration reduced by more than 4 log(1)(0) CFU ml(-)(1) after 3 h incubation at 4 degrees C. As far as we know, this is the first report of a Listeria phage endolysin to control pathogens in soya milk and to demonstrate endolysin activity in foods at refrigeration temperatures. Moreover, LysZ5 may also be useful for biocontrol in other ready-to-eat foods.
TI  - Essential oil composition and antibacterial activity of Monticalia greenmaniana (Asteraceae).
AB  - The essential oils from fresh aerial parts of Monticalia greenmaniana (Hieron) C. Jeffrey (Asteraceae) collected in March, were analyzed by GC/MS. Oil yields (w/v) of 0.1% (flowers), 0.07%, (stems) and 0.1% (leaves) were obtained by hydrodistillation. Thirteen, sixteen and eighteen components, respectively, were identified by comparison of their mass spectra with those in the Wiley GC-MS Library data base. The major components of the flower and stem oils were 1-nonane (38.8% flowers; 33.5% stems), alpha-pinene (29.0% flowers; 14.8% stems) and germacrene D (15.6% flowers; 18.6% stems). However, in the leaf oil, germacrene D was observed at 50.7%, followed by beta-cedrene at 8.4%. The leaf essential oil showed a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity against the important human pathogenic Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923), Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 19433), Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (ATCC 25955) with MIC values ranging from 75 to 6000 ppm.
TI  - [Diaper cystitis as recurrent cause of urinary infections in geriatric community  hospital].
AB  - AIM: Chronic cystitis in diaper-dependent elderly patients can be a causative pathology for recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) in community hospitals. METHODS: We analyzed hospital infections to determine causative organisms from January 2007 to December 2009 in patients in a long-term care hospital. The reading causes of hospital infections were UTIs (30.4%), aspiration pneumonia (CAP; 26%) and hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP; 17.2%). Of a total of 3,097 hospital infections over the investigation period, UTIs were the most common (n=940, 30.4%) followed by CAP (n=809, 26%) and HAP (n=533, 17.2%). Of 278 UTIs in 2007, the causative strains were Escherichia coli (n=106, 38%), Enterococcus faecalis (n=44, 16%), Proteus mirabilis (n=31, 11%), alpha-hemolytic streptococcus (n=22, 8%), and beta-hemolytic streptococcus (n=14, 5%). Extended spectrum beta-lactamase (n=14, 13%) strains were noted in 106 patients with Escherichia coli. We then retrospectively examined the records of 110 diaper dependent elderly patients, (medical words, n=52, mix-care wards, n=68) for UTIs over the same study period. Of these 16 (14.5%) had no UTIs at any time, 12 (11%) were infected 50% of the time, 17 (15.5%) were infected 51% to 99% of the time and 65 (59%) were infected 100% of the time. The UTI rate was not correlated with bladder function or between the 2 wards. We treated bacterial cystitis with antibiotics for 3-5 days but these were unsuccessful. Antiseptics worked temporarily, but recurrence or re-infection always occurred. It remains unknown if diapers are a potential cause of chronic cystitis in dependent elderly patients. The clinical dilemma of whether recurrent diaper cystitis should be treated and prohibit the growth and spread of drug-resistant strains, remains challenging.
TI  - Oral application of bacterial lysate in infancy decreases the risk of atopic dermatitis in children with 1 atopic parent in a randomized, placebo-controlled trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lower prevalence of atopy was found in children with continuous exposure to livestock and thus to microbial compounds. In animal models exposure to endotoxin (LPS) decreases allergic sensitization and airway inflammation. OBJECTIVE: We sought to evaluate the effect of orally applied bacterial lysate in infancy on the prevalence of atopic dermatitis (AD) after the treatment phase at 7 months of age. METHODS: This randomized, placebo-controlled trial included 606 newborns with at least single heredity for atopy. From week 5 until the end of month 7, infants were treated orally with bacterial lysate containing heat-killed gram-negative Escherichia coli Symbio and gram-positive Enterococcus faecalis Symbio or its placebo. Children were followed until 3 years of age. RESULTS: There was no difference in the primary outcome between the active and placebo groups in the total study group. AD prevalence was significantly reduced at the end of the intervention phase (31 weeks of age) in the subgroup of infants with single heredity for atopy (relative risk, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.3-0.9). Ten percent (15/154) of infants in the active group had AD compared with 19% (27/145, P = .030) in the placebo group. This was more pronounced in the group of infants with paternal heredity for atopy (11% vs 32%, P = .004; relative risk, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.2-0.7). CONCLUSION: Feeding of bacterial lysate might have prevented the development of AD, especially in children with paternal atopy, possibly indicating a preventive property only in subjects with a limited risk for atopy.
TI  - Validation of direct plating of a stool sample as a method for Listeria monocytogenes detection.
AB  - The aim of current studies was to validate the direct plating of a stool sample for Listeria monocytogenes detection, using selective medium Palcam agar with Palcam selective supplement. Validation was performed using stool samples collected from healthy humans inoculated with Listeria sp. strains. Stool samples were frozen to determine the influence of freezing on method robustness. The presented research defines the Listeria monocytogenes limit of detection (LOD) as 10(3) cfu/g of stools for fresh and frozen samples. Repeatability and reproducibility of the method has been confirmed using statistical methods. We show the effectiveness of direct plating of stool samples on Palcam agar with Palcam selective supplement collected for Listeria monocytogenes detection. This method could be useful for this pathogen detection in stool samples collected from patients with diarrhoea.
TI  - In vitro study of elution kinetics and bio-activity of meropenem-loaded acrylic bone cement.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Use of antibiotic-loaded acrylic bone cement to treat orthopaedic infections continues to remain popular, but resistance to routinely used antibiotics has led to the search for alternative, more effective antibiotics. We studied, in vitro, the elution kinetics and bio-activity of different concentrations of meropenem-loaded acrylic bone cement. METHODS: Meropenem-loaded bone cement cylinders of different concentrations were serially immersed in normal saline. Elution kinetics was studied by measuring the drug concentration in the eluate, collected at pre-determined intervals, by high-performance liquid chromatography. Bio-activity of the eluate of two different antibiotic concentrations was tested for a period of 3 weeks against each of the following organisms: Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 2593 (MSSA), Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, S. aureus ATCC 43300 (MRSA) and Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 700603 (ESBL). RESULTS: Meropenem elutes from acrylic bone cement for a period of 3-27 days depending on the concentration of antibiotic. Higher doses of antibiotic concentration resulted in greater elution of the antibiotic. The eluate was found to be biologically active against S. aureus ATCC 2593 (MSSA), P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853, E. coli ATCC 25922 and K. pneumoniae ATCC 700603 (ESBL) for a period of 3 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: The elution of meropenem is in keeping with typical antibiotic-loaded acrylic bone cement elution characteristics. The use of high-dose meropenem-loaded acrylic bone cement seems to be an attractive option for treatment of resistant Gram-negative orthopaedic infections but needs to be tested in vivo.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance pattern of uropathogenic Escherichia coli in South West Nigeria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Various studies have indicated Escherichia coli to be the most prevalent pathogen isolated in urine specimens. OBJECTIVES: This study was therefore conducted to find out whether the same holds in this environment. The study will also determine the resistance pattern of uropathogenic Escherichia coli isolates to available antibiotics. METHODS: Two hundred consecutive urine samples collected from patients with clinical diagnosis of urinary tract infections (UTI) and which have significant bacteriuria were included in this study. These were analysed using standard bacteriological techniques. Escherichia coli isolated from the urine specimens were subjected to antibiotic susceptibility testing because many cases of resistance to commonly available antibiotics here have been encountered in the course of management of patients with UTI. RESULTS: Klebsiella species (40%) were found to be the most prevalent uropathogen in this environment, followed by E. coli (25%), Staphylococcus aureus (25%), Proteus species (4%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2.5%), and Enterococcus faecalis (3.5%). Resistance of E. coli to antibiotics commonly used in our environment for UTI, namely, amoxicillin/ clavulanate, cotrimoxazole and amoxicillin were 100% each. Resistance rates to other antibiotics such as ofloxacin, gentamycin, nalidixic acid and tetracycline were 70%, 92%, 96% and 88% respectively. CONCLUSION: The high antibiotic resistance rates recorded in this study therefore calls for urgent review of existing and implementation of effective antibiotic policy in this community.
TI  - Antibacterial and antimycobacterial lignans and flavonoids from Larrea tridentata.
AB  - Three lignans and four flavonoids were isolated and characterized from Larrea tridentata and compounds were tested against 16 bacterial species/strains. Results showed that: dihydroguaiaretic acid (1) had activity towards methicillin resistant (MR) Staphylococcus aureus (minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) 50 microg/mL) and multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MIC 12.5-50 microg/mL); 4-epi-larreatricin (2) was active against Enterobacter cloacae (MIC 12.5 microg/mL), as well as sensitive (MIC 50 microg/mL) and MDR strains of M. tuberculosis (MIC 25 microg/mL). 3'-Demethoxy-6-O-demethylisoguaiacin (3) displayed activity against sensitive and resistant S. aureus (MIC 25 microg/mL), Enterococcus faecalis (MIC 12.5 microg/mL), Escherichia coli (MIC 50 microg/mL), E. cloacae (MIC 12.5 microg/mL) and MDR strains of M. tuberculosis (MIC 12.5 microg/mL). 5,4'-Dihydroxy-3,7,8,3'-tetramethoxyflavone (4) and 5,4'-dihydroxy-3,7,8-trimethoxyflavone (5) were active against M. tuberculosis MDR strains having MIC values of 25 and 25-50 microg/mL, respectively, while 5,4'-dihydroxy-7-methoxyflavone (6) was active against S. aureus (MIC 50 microg/mL) and E. faecalis (MIC 50 microg/mL). We concluded that lignan 3 is the main compound responsible for the antibacterial activity of L. tridentata. Lignans 1 and 2 as well as flavonoid 6 contribute with some degree of antibacterial activity. On the other hand, compounds 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 contributed to the antimycobacterial activity found in L. tridentata.
TI  - Inhibition of Candida albicans yeast-hyphal transition and biofilm formation by Solidago virgaurea water extracts.
AB  - Xerostomia is a decrease of saliva secretion, which can unbalance the oral microflora, mainly to the benefit of Candida albicans. The aim of the present study was to find a plant extract that could create an unfavourable environment for Candida, and would, therefore, be appropriate for use in a dry-mouth daily-care mouthwash. Water extract from the herbaceous plant Solidago virgaurea (Goldenrod) was selected due to its saponin content (plant detergents). Saponin concentrations reached 0.7 and 0.95 mg ml(-1) in S. virgaurea subsp. virgaurea and S. virgaurea subsp. alpestris extracts, respectively. C. albicans was grown in liquid medium and cells were counted by microscopic examination after 0, 4 and 24 h of incubation. Solidago extracts did not inhibit the growth of C. albicans (four strains), Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius or Enterococcus faecalis. When inocula were incubated with Solidago extract for 4 and 24 h, we observed a decrease in Candida yeast-hyphal transition. Candida biofilms were then prepared in microtitre plates and treated with plant extracts at 0 h, to estimate biofilm formation, or at 18 h to estimate the effect of the saponin on pre-formed biofilms. Biofilm formation and pre-formed biofilms were both strongly inhibited. In conclusion, the S. virgaurea extract was efficient against two key virulence factors of C. albicans: the yeast-hyphal transition phase and biofilm formation.
TI  - Correlation between chemical composition and antibacterial activity of essential  oils from fifteen Eucalyptus species growing in the Korbous and Jbel Abderrahman arboreta (North East Tunisia).
AB  - The essential oils of fifteen Eucalyptus species harvested from the Jbel Abderrahman and Korbous arboreta (North East Tunisia) were screened for their antibacterial activities by the agar disc diffusion method. Eighteen major components as identified by GC/FID and GC/MS were selected for a study of the chemical and biological activity variability. The main one was 1,8-cineole, followed by spathulenol, trans-pinocarveol, alpha-pinene, p-cymene, globulol, cryptone, beta-phellandrene, viridiflorol, borneol, limonene and isospathulenol. The chemical principal component analysis identified five species groups and subgroups, where each group constituted a chemotype, however that of the values of zone diameter of the inhibition (zdi) identified six groups of Eucalyptus oils, characterized by their antibacterial inhibition ability. The strongest activity was shown by E. platypus oil against Enterococcus faecalis and by E. lamannii oil against Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli. A correlation between the levels of some major components and the antibacterial activities was observed.
TI  - Comparison of swab transport media for recovery of Listeria monocytogenes from environmental samples.
AB  - Environmental monitoring is recognized as an important strategy for controlling Listeria monocytogenes in food processing facilities. Samples are taken by swabbing environmental surfaces, and the swabs are immersed in a medium for transport to the laboratory. In this study, buffered peptone water (BPW), Dey-Engley neutralizing broth (DE), neutralizing buffer (NB), Letheen broth (LE), and newly described MCC buffer (MCC) were evaluated as transport media for recovery of sanitizer-stressed L. monocytogenes from inoculated swabs. After storage at 4 degrees C, the media performed similarly, but at 25 degrees C relative recovery efficiency from the inoculated sponges was DE > LE > BPW > MCC > NB. Recoveries from stainless steel surfaces followed similar trends. MCC, DE, and NB were compared for L. monocytogenes recovery in the presence of Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Lactobacillus plantarum, Pseudomonas fluorescens, and Listeria innocua. After 4 degrees C storage, all population levels changed little; after 25 degrees C storage, DE allowed the best growth of L. monocytogenes regardless of other species present. MCC, DE, and NB performed similarly for recovery of L. monocytogenes from an artificial milk biofilm and for recovery of Listeria spp. from swabs obtained from a meat processing facility. Transport medium formulation, time and temperature of swab storage, and coexistence of other species affect recovery of sanitizer-stressed L. monocytogenes from environmental swabs. The study confirms the need to maintain 4 degrees C storage conditions during swab transport.
TI  - Microbiological aspects of vulvovaginitis in prepubertal girls.
AB  - This study aimed to establish the vaginal introitus microbial flora in girls with and without symptoms of vulvovaginitis, and to present the distribution of isolated microorganisms by age groups in girls with vulvovaginitis. We enrolled 500 girls with vulvovaginitis symptoms, aged 2-12 years, referred by their pediatricians for microbiological examination of the vaginal introitus swabs, and 30 age-matched asymptomatic girls. Similar microbial flora was isolated in both groups, but the symptomatic girls had significantly more common positive microbiological findings compared to controls (p < 0.001). In symptomatic girls, the following pathogenic bacteria were isolated: Streptococcus pyogenes (4.2%), Haemophilus influenzae (0.4%), and Staphylococcus aureus (5.8%). Bacteria of fecal origin were found in vaginal introitus swabs in 33.8% of cases, most commonly Proteus mirabilis (14.4%), Enterococcus faecalis (12.2%), and Escherichia coli (7.0%). The finding of fecal flora was more common compared to controls, reaching a statistical significance (p < 0.05), as well as in girls aged up to 6 years (p < 0.001). Candida species were found in 2.4% of girls with vulvovaginitis symptoms. CONCLUSION: The microbial ecosystem in girls with clinical signs of vulvovaginitis is complex and variable, and the presence of a microorganism does not necessarily imply that it is the cause of infection. The diagnosis of vulvovaginitis in prepubertal girls requires a complex and comprehensive approach, and microbiological findings should be interpreted in the context of clinical findings.
TI  - Enzymatic detergent in rat peritoneum. A comparative study with physiological solution.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Peritoneal washing out with physiological solution with different substances added is useful in peritoneal infections, but the effect of enzymatic detergents, such as quaternary didecyl-dimethyl ammonium compounds (DDAC), used in the sterilization of surgical material is unknown. We undertook this study to determine histological changes (inflammation, fibrosis and new vessel formation) in the peritoneum of Wistar rats after the application of physiological solution or DDAC. METHODS: The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of DDAC for E. coli (512 mug/ml) and E. faecalis (128 mug/ml) was determined. Sixty-three Wistar rats weighing 200 +/- 20 g were studied. They were divided into three groups: control: 7 rats were instilled with 3 ml of physiological solution in peritoneal cavity; groups 1 and 2 were instilled with 3 ml of MIC for E. coli and E. faecalis, respectively. These groups were divided into four subgroups of seven animals. In every rat, 1 cm(2) of peritoneum was obtained at 2, 7, 14, and 21 days for histological study with hematoxylin-eosin. Ten fields were evaluated. The data obtained were analyzed with the Mann-Whitney test. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in inflammation, fibrosis and new vessel formation with the physiological solution vs. DDAC at 2, 7, 14, and 21 days (p >0.05), except for inflammation at 2 days in group 2 (p = 0.026), which remitted. CONCLUSIONS: There was no significant difference in changes in rat peritoneum after physiological solution or DDAC application.
TI  - Development of 4H-pyridopyrimidines: a class of selective bacterial protein synthesis inhibitors.
AB  - BACKGROUND: We have identified a series of compounds that inhibit protein synthesis in bacteria. Initial IC50's in aminoacylation/translation (A/T) assays ranged from 3 to14 muM. This series of compounds are variations on a 5,6,7,8-tetrahydropyrido[4,3-d]pyrimidin-4-ol scaffold (e.g., 4H-pyridopyrimidine). METHODS: Greater than 80 analogs were prepared to investigate the structure-activity relationship (SAR). Structural modifications included changes in the central ring and substituent modifications in its periphery focusing on the 2- and 6-positions. An A/T system was used to determine IC50 values for activity of the analogs in biochemical assays. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were determined for each analog against cultures of Enterococcus faecalis, Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli tolC mutants and E. coli modified with PMBN. RESULTS: Modifications to the 2-(pyridin-2-yl) ring resulted in complete inactivation of the compounds. However, certain modifications at the 6-position resulted in increased antimicrobial potency. The optimized compounds inhibited the growth of E. faecalis, M. catarrhalis, H. influenzae, S. pneumoniae, S. aureus, E. coli tolC, mutants and E. coli modified with PMBN with MIC values of 4, </= 0.12, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1 mug/ml, respectively. IC50 values in biochemical assay were reduced to mid-nanomolar range. CONCLUSION: 4H-pyridopyrimidine analogs demonstrate broad-spectrum inhibition of bacterial growth and modification of the compounds establishes SAR.
TI  - Efficient synthesis and biological evaluation of proximicins A, B and C.
AB  - A quick and efficient synthesis and the biological evaluation of promising antitumor-antibiotics proximicins A, B and C are reported. The characteristic repetitive unit of these molecules, the methyl 4-Boc-aminofuran-2-carboxylate 15, was prepared in three synthetic steps in good yield using an optimised copper-catalysed amidation method. The proximicins were evaluated for their antitumor activity using cellular methods. Proximicin B induced apoptosis in both Hodgkin's lymphoma and T-cell leukemia cell lines and proximicin C exhibited significantly high cytotoxicity against glioblastoma and breast carcinoma cells. The proximicins were also screened against Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis and several strains of methicillin-and multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Proximicin B showed noteworthy activity against antibiotic-resistant Gram-positive cocci.
TI  - Antiadhesive activity of the biosurfactant pseudofactin II secreted by the Arctic bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens BD5.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pseudofactin II is a recently identified biosurfactant secreted by Pseudomonas fluorescens BD5, the strain obtained from freshwater from the Arctic Archipelago of Svalbard. Pseudofactin II is a novel compound identified as cyclic lipopeptide with a palmitic acid connected to the terminal amino group of eighth amino acid in peptide moiety. The C-terminal carboxylic group of the last amino acid forms a lactone with the hydroxyl of Thr3. Adhesion is the first stage of biofilm formation and the best moment for the action of antiadhesive and anti-biofilm compounds. Adsorption of biosurfactants to a surface e.g. glass, polystyrene, silicone modifies its hydrophobicity, interfering with the microbial adhesion and desorption processes. In this study the role and applications of pseudofactin II as a antiadhesive compound has been investigated from medicinal and therapeutic perspectives. RESULTS: Pseudofactin II lowered the adhesion to three types of surfaces (glass, polystyrene and silicone) of bacterial strains of five species: Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus hirae, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Proteus mirabilis and two Candida albicans strains. Pretreatment of a polystyrene surface with 0.5 mg/ml pseudofactin II inhibited bacterial adhesion by 36-90% and that of C. albicans by 92-99%. The same concentration of pseudofactin II dislodged 26-70% of preexisting biofilms grown on previously untreated surfaces. Pseudofactin II also caused a marked inhibition of the initial adhesion of E. faecalis, E. coli, E. hirae and C. albicans strains to silicone urethral catheters. The highest concentration tested (0.5 mg/ml) caused a total growth inhibition of S. epidermidis, partial (18-37%) inhibition of other bacteria and 8-9% inhibition of C. albicans growth. CONCLUSION: Pseudofactin II showed antiadhesive activity against several pathogenic microorganisms which are potential biofilm formers on catheters, implants and internal prostheses. Up to 99% prevention could be achieved by 0.5 mg/ml pseudofactin II. In addition, pseudofactin II dispersed preformed biofilms. Pseudofactin II can be used as a disinfectant or surface coating agent against microbial colonization of different surfaces, e.g. implants or urethral catheters.
TI  - Chemical composition and antibacterial activity of the volatile oil from seeds of Artemisia annua L. from Iran.
AB  - The composition of essential oil of the seeds of Artemisia annua L. was analysed  by GC-MS. Overall, 16 volatile components were identified on the basis of their mass spectra characteristics and retention indices representing 95.5% of the total oil. Trans-3(10)-caren-4-ol (22.3%), artemisia ketone (18.6%), 1,8-cineole (14.9%), delta-selinene (13.0%) and alpha-pinene (8.2%) were the major compounds. Oxygenated monoterpenes were the main compounds with 51.6% followed by sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (13.3%), monoterpene hydrocarbons (9.9%) and other compounds (8.3%). The essential oil was highly active against Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis.
TI  - Assessment of the antimicrobial activity of acellular vascular grafts.
AB  - Several studies have reported biological vascular grafts to be more resistant to  microbial infection than synthetic counterparts in vivo. Indeed, small intestinal submucosa (SIS) materials have previously been reported to be antimicrobial. The aim of this study was to assess the antimicrobial activity and the ability to resist biofilm formation of a novel acellular vascular graft and compare it to commercially available alternatives using a range of organisms: MRSA, MSSA, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans. This was achieved using a modified disk diffusion assay and extraction of the materials into solution followed by minimum inhibitory concentration assays. To assess resistance to biofilm formation a novel biofilm assay was developed which compared the total colony forming units (CFU) recovered from each material and identification of the percentage of CFU which were loosely attached, residing within the biofilm or attached to the biomaterial. The results indicated a lack of antimicrobial activity for all materials tested, including SIS. The biological materials were more resistant to the formation of a biofilm compared to Dacron.
TI  - Rapid detection of urinary tract pathogens using microcalorimetry: principle, technique and first results.
AB  - What's known on the subject? and What does the study add? Microcalorimetry has been applied in several microbiological studies, but never in a clinical urological context. In addition, basic knowledge on the growth of urinary pathogens in urine is still scarce and data regarding the growth rate of many urinary pathogens in urine are still not available. The study demonstrates that this innovative application of microcalorimetry is useful in (i) investigating the growth of urinary pathogens in sterilized urine and (ii) as a rapid tool for diagnosis of urinary infection as well as for further identification of the causative infectious agent. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the value of isothermal microcalorimetry (IMC) in the detection and differentiation of common urinary tract pathogens in urine. IMC is a non-specific analytical tool for the measurement of heat in the microwatt range. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A microcalorimeter equipped with 48 channels was used. Detection was accomplished, and growth was monitored for four bacterial strains in sterilized urine at 37 degrees C by measuring metabolic heat flow (microW = microJ/s) as a function of time. The strains were Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus. RESULTS: Bacterial growth was detected after 3.1 to 17.1 h with decreasing inocula. The detection limit was 1 colony-forming unit (CFU)/mL for E. coli, 10 CFU/mL for P. mirabilis and E. faecalis and 10(3) CFU/mL for S. aureus. The total heat was highest in P. mirabilis ranging from 10 to 12 J, followed by E. coli (3-4 J), S. aureus (2-3 J) and E. faecalis (1.3-1.5 J). The shape of the heat flow curves was characteristic for each species independent of its initial concentration. CONCLUSIONS: IMC allows rapid detection of bacteriuria, much faster than conventional culture. Urinary tract pathogen detection after only 3.1 h is realistic. Clearly different heat flow patterns enable accurate pathogen differentiation. Due to expeditious identification of urine samples that contain only low colony counts (i.e. less than 10(3) CFU/mL), IMC may become a valuable screening tool for detecting the presence of significant bacteriuria.
TI  - The effect of various concentrations of iodine potassium iodide on the antimicrobial properties of mineral trioxide aggregate--a pilot study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) is a multi-purpose dental material with various uses in dentistry. Iodine potassium iodide (IKI) is the most commonly used iodine compound in endodontics. We aimed to assess the antimicrobial activity of tooth-colored ProRoot MTA combined with IKI. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The antimicrobial activity of IKI was assessed at three concentrations (1%, 2%, and 4%) as the mixing agents combined with MTA against Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Candida albicans. For each microorganism, three plates were inoculated with 100 mul of a microbial suspension (McFarland 0.5). Four wells were prepared in each plate. MTA (70 mg) was mixed with any of the three concentrations of IKI (25 mul) or sterile distilled water (25 mul) and placed in each well. The plates were incubated for 24 h at 37 degrees C. Zones of inhibition (ZOI) were measured in millimeters by a blinded observer. Data were analyzed using analysis of variance and the Dunnett t-test. RESULTS: All MTA mixtures with water or IKI solutions showed inhibitory zones. The mean ZOI of each MTA/IKI mixture was not significantly different from MTA/water mixture (P > 0.05). MTA/1% IKI had smaller ZOI than MTA/water against E. coli, E. faecalis, and C. albicans. MTA/2% IKI showed larger ZOI only against P. aeruginosa. MTA/4% IKI showed larger ZOI against P. aeruginosa and E. coli (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Substitution of IKI solutions (1%, 2%, and 4%) for water did not significantly increase the antimicrobial activity of MTA.
TI  - Broad identification of bacterial type in urinary tract infection using (1)h NMR  spectroscopy.
AB  - To address the shortcomings of urine culture for the rapid identification of urinary tract infection (UTI), we applied (1)H-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy as a surrogate method for fast screening of microorganisms. Study includes 682 urine samples from suspected UTI patients, 50 healthy volunteers, and commercially available standard strains of gram negative bacilli (GNB) (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumonia, Enterobacter, Acinetobacter, Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter frundii) and gram positive cocci (GPC) (Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus group B, Staphylococcus saprophyticus). Acetate, lactate, ethanol, succinate, creatinine, trimethylamine (TMA), citrate, trimethylamin-N-oxide, glycine, urea, and hippurate were measured by (1)H NMR spectroscopy. All urine specimens were evaluated with culture method. Multivariate discriminant function analysis (DFA) reveals that acetate, lactate, succinate, and formate were able to differentiate, with high accuracy (99.5%), healthy controls from UTI patients. This statistical analysis was also able to classify GNB to GPC infected urine samples with high accuracy (96%). This technique appears to be a promising, rapid, and noninvasive approach to probing GNB and GPC infected urine specimens with its distinguishing metabolic profile. The determination of infection will be very important for rapidly and efficiently measuring the efficacy of a tailored treatment, leading to prompt and appropriate care of UTI patients.
TI  - MurAA is required for intrinsic cephalosporin resistance of Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - Enterococcus faecalis is a low-GC Gram-positive bacterium that is intrinsically resistant to cephalosporins, antibiotics that target cell wall biosynthesis. To probe the mechanistic basis for intrinsic resistance, a library of transposon mutants was screened to identify E. faecalis strains that are highly susceptible to ceftriaxone, revealing a transposon mutant with a disruption in murAA. murAA is predicted to encode a UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 1-carboxyvinyl transferase that catalyzes the first committed step in peptidoglycan synthesis: phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP)-dependent conversion of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine to UDP-N-acetylglucosamine-enolpyruvate. In-frame deletion of murAA, but not its homolog in the E. faecalis genome (murAB), led to increased susceptibility of E. faecalis to cephalosporins. Furthermore, expression of murAA enhanced cephalosporin resistance in an E. faecalis mutant lacking IreK (formerly PrkC), a key kinase required for cephalosporin resistance. Further genetic analysis revealed that MurAA catalytic activity is necessary but not sufficient for this role. Collectively, our data indicate that MurAA and MurAB have distinct roles in E. faecalis physiology and suggest that MurAA possesses a unique property or activity that enables it to enhance intrinsic resistance of E. faecalis to cephalosporins.
TI  - Indirect rapid prototyping of antibacterial acid anhydride copolymer microneedles.
AB  - Microneedles are needle-like projections with microscale features that may be used for transdermal delivery of a variety of pharmacologic agents, including antibacterial agents. In the study described in this paper, an indirect rapid prototyping approach involving a combination of visible light dynamic mask micro-stereolithography and micromolding was used to prepare microneedle arrays out of a biodegradable acid anhydride copolymer, Gantrez((R)) AN 169 BF. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, energy dispersive x-ray spectrometry and nanoindentation studies were performed to evaluate the chemical and mechanical properties of the Gantrez((R)) AN 169 BF material. Agar plating studies were used to evaluate the in vitro antimicrobial performance of these arrays against Bacillus subtilis, Candida albicans, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. Large zones of growth inhibition were noted for Escherichia coli, S. aureus, Enterococcus faecalis and B. subtilis. The performance of Gantrez((R)) AN 169 BF against several bacteria suggests that biodegradable acid anhydride copolymer microneedle arrays prepared using visible light dynamic mask micro-stereolithography micromolding may be useful for treating a variety of skin infections.
TI  - Degradation, mineralization and antibiotic inactivation of amoxicillin by UV-A/TiO(2) photocatalysis.
AB  - The UV-A/TiO(2) photocatalytic decomposition of amoxicillin (AMX) in aqueous suspensions was investigated. Experiments were performed at antibiotic concentrations between 2.5 and 30 mg/L, eight commercially available TiO(2) catalysts at loadings between 100 and 750 mg/L, acidic or near-neutral conditions (pH 5 or 7.5) and two different matrices (ultrapure water and secondary treated effluent) at a photon flux of 8 x 10(-4) E/(L min). Of the various catalysts tested, Degussa P25 was highly active, i.e. complete AMX degradation and 93% mineralization could be achieved after 25 and 90 min of reaction, respectively at 10 mg/L AMX and 250 mg/L titania. In general, mineralization was slower than degradation due to the formation of stable transformation by-products. For the range of concentrations studied, initial degradation rates can be approached by a Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetic model, while the reaction order with respect to AMX shifts from first to zeroth as initial concentration increases from 2.5 to 5 mg/L to higher values. Degradation in treated effluent was partly impeded compared to pure water due to the inherent presence of organic and inorganic constituents that compete for hydroxyl radicals. Although increasing solution pH from 5 to 7.5 had no effect on degradation, it retarded mineralization. The antibiotic activity of AMX prior to and after photocatalytic degradation was tested to three reference bacterial strains, namely Escherichia coli (ATCC 23716), Klebsiella pneumoniae (NCTC 5056) and Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 14506). The first two were found to be highly resistant at AMX concentrations up to 25 mg/L, while the latter could partly be inactivated at lower AMX concentrations (i.e. 10 mg/L) and/or in the presence of photocatalytic by-products.
TI  - Iron availability increases the pathogenic potential of Salmonella typhimurium and other enteric pathogens at the intestinal epithelial interface.
AB  - Recent trials have questioned the safety of untargeted oral iron supplementation  in developing regions. Excess of luminal iron could select for enteric pathogens at the expense of beneficial commensals in the human gut microflora, thereby increasing the incidence of infectious diseases. The objective of the current study was to determine the effect of high iron availability on virulence traits of prevalent enteric pathogens at the host-microbe interface. A panel of enteric bacteria was cultured under iron-limiting conditions and in the presence of increasing concentrations of ferric citrate to assess the effect on bacterial growth, epithelial adhesion, invasion, translocation and epithelial damage in vitro. Translocation and epithelial integrity experiments were performed using a transwell system in which Caco-2 cells were allowed to differentiate to a tight epithelial monolayer mimicking the intestinal epithelial barrier. Growth of Salmonella typhimurium and other enteric pathogens was increased in response to iron. Adhesion of S. typhimurium to epithelial cells markedly increased when these bacteria were pre-incubated with increasing iron concentration (P = 0.0001), whereas this was not the case for the non-pathogenic Lactobacillus plantarum (P = 0.42). Cellular invasion and epithelial translocation of S. typhimurium followed the trend of increased adhesion. Epithelial damage was increased upon incubation with S. typhimurium or Citrobacter freundii that were pre-incubated under iron-rich conditions. In conclusion, our data fit with the consensus that oral iron supplementation is not without risk as iron could, in addition to inducing pathogenic overgrowth, also increase the virulence of prevalent enteric pathogens.
TI  - Antibacterial effect and cytotoxicity of beta-1,3-1, 4-glucanase from endophytic  Bacillus subtilis SWB8.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We studied the antibiotic activity and selective cytotoxicity of beta-1,3-1,4-glucanase from endophytic Bacillus subtilis SWB8. METHODS: Based on gel permeation chromatography, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry methods, protein fragments of beta-1,3-1,4-glucanase from endophytic Bacillus subtilis strain SWB8 were purified and identified. Then, beta-1,3-1,4-glucanase was used to evaluate the antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, Salmonella paratyphi A, Shigella dysenteriae, Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans and cytotoxicity against human pulmonary adenocarcinoma cells (A549) and human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) by using the disc diffusion, methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium and flow cytometry methods, respectively. RESULTS: Bacterial beta-1,3-1,4-glucanase showed broad antimicrobial spectrum against all nine bacterial and fungal strains. Furthermore, beta-1,3-1,4-glucanase possessed significant anticancer activity against A549 cells that the IC50 and IC90 values were 11.5 and 20.1 microg/mL, respectively. The percentage of apoptotic A549 cells treated with different concentrations of beta-1,3-1,4-glucanase was significantly increased from 4.43% of the control to 43.1% of 19.2 microg/mL glucanase in a dose dependent manner. In contrast, these changes could not be observed in human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells. CONCLUSION: Beta-1,3-1,4-glucanase could be a potential source of desirable antimicrobial agent, or anticancer compounds with higher efficiency and lower toxicity.
TI  - Relationship between urinary tract infection categorization and pathogens' antimicrobial susceptibilities.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Urinary tract infections (UTIs) can be hard to treat and treatment plans need to include accurate categorization such as uncomplicated or complicated UTI, or catheterized or uncatheterized UTI. We investigated the antibiotic susceptibilities of representative uropathogens in UTI categories. METHODS: We isolated uropathogens and analyzed their antimicrobial susceptibilities according to UTI categorization such as: (1) urology outpatients, urology inpatients, or other department inpatients; (2) uncomplicated or complicated UTIs; (3) upper or lower UTIs, and (4) non-catheterized or catheterized UTIs. RESULTS: Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were representative uropathogens. Susceptibilities to levofloxacin (LVFX) in E. coli in urology outpatients (p = 0.0179), those to ceftadizime in E. coli in other department inpatients (p = 0.0327), and those to LVFX in E. faecalis in complicated UTI (p = 0.0137) significantly decreased in these 3 years compared with the previous 3 years. Susceptibilities of upper UTI to LVFX in E. coli were significantly lower in the recent 4 years compared to lower UTI (p = 0.0452) and those of catheterized UTI to LVFX in E. faecalis were significantly lower than in non-catheterized UTI (p = 0.0153). CONCLUSIONS: Data demonstrated different tendencies of uropathogens' antibiotic susceptibilities according to UTI categorizations and they could be useful for planning UTI treatments.
TI  - [Septic complications after multilocal fractures and multiple traumatic injury].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The increase of the number of the multiple traumatic injuries is related to social factors, such as: the development of industry, the change of life style and the conditions of work, the manner and the speed of relocation and the biological factors related with the elongation of life time. According to the World Health Organization data the injuries are one of the main health problems in the world. AIM: The clinical analysis of multitrauma patients treated due to the septic complications of the fractures. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The material consists of 34 multitrauma patients treated in The Osteomyelitis and Septic Complications Unit in Prof. A. Gruca Orthopedic and Trauma Hospital in Otwock, Poland between 2005 and 2010. The cause of trauma, the timing of arrival to our unit, the number of the days of treatment, the number and the specificity of bone and internal injuries, the bacteriology of bone infections and operative techniques and pharmacologic treatment were analyzed. RESULTS: The causes of the injuries were: road accident (79%), fall from the height (8.8%), others (12.2%). The first stay in our unit was 21 months after the injury on average (1-129 months), the number of stays in the unit was 2,8 on average (1-6), the length of stay was 25.7 days on average (4-108 days). In analyzed group of 34 patients, we found: 12 opened fractures of single bone, 11 opened fractures of more than one bone, 22 closed fractures of single bone, 12 closed fracture of more than one bone. Central nervous system (55.9%), abdominal organs (35.3%) and thorax (29.4%) were the most common internal organs ocuppied with the injury. Osteomyelitis was the most frequently diagnosed in femur (50%) and tibia (41.2%). The main reasons of bone infection were: Methycylin-Sensitive Staphylococcus Aureus (35,3%), Methycylin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (17,3%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (23,5%), Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter baumani, Enterococcus faecalis. The following treatment was undertaken: the debridement of septic bone, usually together with the removal of the hardware stabilization (73,5%), the removal of the damaged or improperly fixed stabilization (44%), the conversion of the internal fixation into the external fixation(62%). All the patients were taken intravenous antibiotics according to The Hospital Commission for Preventing of Infections, i.e. 2nd generation cephalosporin and gentamycin. Culture directed antibiotics were started after receiving the bacteriology results. The outcomes. The control of infection in 14 patients (41.3%), 18 patients (52.9%) still remain under the treatment, bad outcome (persistent infection, amputation of a extremity) we had in 2 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple traumatic injury and its immunologic consequences predispose to systemic infections including bone infections. Posttraumatic osteomyelitis is the indication to chronic treatment. Surgical management of the wound and external fixation of the fractures of the long bones according to the control damage surgery is the most important in prevention of posttraumatic osteomyelitis.
TI  - Impact of curcumin supersaturation in antibacterial photodynamic therapy--effect  of cyclodextrin type and amount: studies on curcumin and curcuminoides XLV.
AB  - Curcumin has been investigated as a potential photosensitizer (PS) in antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT). The phototoxic effect of curcumin is dependent on proper formulations of the compound because of the lipophilic nature of the molecule and the extremely low water solubility at physiological conditions. In the present study, the combination of curcumin with either a methylated beta-cyclodextrin (CD) or polyethylene glycol-based beta-CD or gamma-CD polymers was investigated in aPDT using Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Enterococcus faecalis as model bacteria. Solutions with various supersaturation ratios of curcumin were prepared with the selected CD or CD polymers. The concept of supersaturation was then investigated as a mean to enhance the phototoxic effect of curcumin, especially toward the gram-negative bacteria E. coli. A high supersaturation ratio corresponded with high phototoxicity of E. coli. Depending on the curcumin preparation, the bacterial survival ranged from 0.01% to no significant effect after irradiation with blue light (29 J/cm(2) ). Temporal stabilization of the supersaturated state is necessary in order to retain high and predictable photoreactivity of the PS. Further studies will be needed in order to formulate curcumin preparations with acceptable hydrolytic and photolytic stability and a temporal stabilization of a supersaturated state.
TI  - Chemical compositions of the essential oils of the aerial parts of Chamaemelum mixtum (L.) Alloni.
AB  - The chemical compositions of the aerial parts essential oils of Chamaemelum mixtum (L.) Alloni from Corsica and Sardinia were investigated employing gas chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The structure of (Z)-heptadeca-9,16-dien-7-one, a natural compound not previously described, was elucidated by GC-MS (electron impact and chemical ionization) and one-dimensional and two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The variation in C. mixtum essential oil was studied, and statistical analysis showed the clustering of oil samples into three groups according to the amount of oxygenated compounds; these groups correlated to the harvest area. The strong biological activity of the oxygenated fraction (minimum inhibitory concentration of <0.1 mg/mL) of the Corsican oil against Candida albicans , Citrobacter frendii , Enterococcus faecalis , Escherichia coli , Klebsiella pneumoniae , Listeria monocytogenes , and Staphyllococcus aureus can be attributed to the presence of irregular monoterpene alcohols and (Z)-heptadeca-9,16-dien-7-one.
TI  - Antioxidant, antimicrobial activities and fatty acid components of flower, leaf,  stem and seed of Hypericum scabrum.
AB  - The hexane extracts of flower, leaf, stem, and seed of Hypericum scabrum, which were collected from northwestern Iran, were obtained by extraction in a Soxhlet apparatus. The fatty acids were converted to methyl esters and determined by gas chromatography/flame ionization detector (GC/FID) and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) systems. The hexane extract from the flower, leaf, stem, and seed contained 39.1%, 43.2%, 29.0%, and 37.6% of omega-3 fatty acids, respectively. The other main components of the flower extract were tetracosane (12.2%) and palmitic acid (9.3%), and that of the leaf extract was palmitic acid (7.4%). The stem and seed extracts contained bis(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (18.7% and 35.7%), nonacosane (11.7% and 3.9%) and linoleic acid (6.5% and 6.9%) as major components. The hexane extracts of different parts from H. scabrum represent an important source of omega-3 fatty acids in several Hypericum species. The antioxidant activity of all hexane extracts was evaluated by the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging method. The results indicate that hexane extracts from different parts of H. scabrum possess considerable antioxidant activity. The highest radical scavenging activity was detected in seed, which had an IC50 = 165 microg/mL. The antimicrobial activity of the extracts of those samples were determined against seven Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae), as well as three fungi (Candida albicans, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Aspergillus niger). The bioassay showed that the oil exhibited moderate antimicrobial activity. This study reveals that the all parts of this plant are attractive sources of fatty acid components, especially the essential ones, as well as of effective natural antioxidants.
TI  - Influence of terminal substitution on structural, DNA, protein binding, anticancer and antibacterial activities of palladium(II) complexes containing 3-methoxy salicylaldehyde-4(N) substituted thiosemicarbazones.
AB  - The variable chelating behavior of 3-methoxysalicylaldehyde-4(N)-substituted thiosemicarbazones was observed in equimolar reactions with [PdCl(2)(PPh(3))(2)]. The new complexes were characterized by various analytical, spectroscopic techniques (mass, (1)H-NMR, absorption, IR). All the new complexes were structurally characterized by single crystal X-ray diffraction. Crystallographic results showed that the ligands H(2)L(1) and H(2)L(4) are coordinated as binegative tridentate ONS donor ligands in the complexes 1 and 4 by forming six and five member rings. However, the ligands H(2)L(2) and H(2)L(3) bound to palladium in 2 and 3 as uninegative bidentate NS donors by forming a five member chelate ring. From this study, it was found that the substitution on terminal 4(N)-nitrogen may have an influence on the chelating ability of thiosemicarbazone. The presence of hydrogen bonding in 2 and 3 might be responsible for preventing the coordination of phenolic oxygen to the metal ion. The interaction of the complexes with calf-thymus DNA (CT-DNA) has been explored by absorption and emission titration methods. Based on the observations, an electrostatic binding mode of DNA has been proposed. The protein binding studies were monitored by quenching of tryptophan and tyrosine residues in the presence of complexes using Lysozyme as model protein. Antibacterial activity studies of the complexes have been screened against pathogenic bacteria such as Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. MIC50 values of the complexes showed that they exhibited significant activity against the pathogens and among them, 3 exhibited higher activity. Further, anticancer activity of the complexes on the lung cancer cell line A549 has also been studied.
TI  - In vivo antibacterial activity of chinfloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone antibiotic.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the in vivo antibacterial efficacy of chinfloxacin, a novel fluoroquinolone, in murine systemic and local infection models. METHODS: The efficacy of chinfloxacin in systemic infection was evaluated in a mouse peritonitis model using isolates of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA, n = 3), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA; n = 1), penicillin-intermediate Streptococcus pneumoniae (PISP; n = 1), penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP; n = 2), vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis (VSE; n = 1), vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis (VRE; n = 2), Escherichia coli (n = 3) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 2). The local infections included mouse pulmonary infections caused by penicillin-susceptible S. pneumoniae (PSSP; n = 1), PRSP (n = 1) and K. pneumoniae (n = 2). RESULTS: In the mouse systemic infection model, chinfloxacin demonstrated potent activity against MSSA [50% effective dose (ED(50)) 2.28-4.15 mg/kg], MRSA (ED(50) 14.75 mg/kg), PISP (ED(50) 6.20 mg/kg), PRSP (ED(50) 3.51-5.03 mg/kg), VSE (ED(50) 25.02 mg/kg), VRE (ED(50) 5.18-15.39 mg/kg), E. coli (ED(50) 1.25-1.90 mg/kg) and K. pneumoniae (ED(50) 2.92-8.28 mg/kg). The therapeutic efficacy of chinfloxacin was generally similar to (P > 0.05) that of moxifloxacin, significantly higher (P < 0.01 or P < 0.05) than that of levofloxacin in Gram-positive isolate infections (MSSA, MRSA, PISP, PRSP, VSE and VRE), and less than that of levofloxacin against E. coli and K. pneumoniae infections (P < 0.01). In the mouse pulmonary infection model, chinfloxacin showed potent activity towards S. pneumoniae (higher than levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin) and K. pneumoniae (lower than levofloxacin and similar to or higher than ciprofloxacin) infections. CONCLUSIONS: The results validated the potent efficacy of chinfloxacin in vivo. The high efficacy of chinfloxacin in murine systemic and local infections warrants investigation of its clinical use.
TI  - Colicin M hydrolyses branched lipids II from Gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - Lipids II found in some Gram-positive bacteria were prepared in radioactive form  from l-lysine-containing UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide. The specific lateral chains of Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium and Staphylococcus aureus (di-L-alanine, D-isoasparagine, and pentaglycine, respectively) were introduced by chemical peptide synthesis using the Fmoc chemistry. The branched nucleotides obtained were converted into the corresponding lipids II by enzymatic synthesis using the MraY and MurG enzymes. All of the lipids were hydrolysed by Escherichia coli colicin M at approximately the same rate as the meso-diaminopimelate-containing lipid II found in Gram-negative bacteria, thereby opening the way to the use of this enzyme as a broad spectrum antibacterial agent.
TI  - Characterization of fecal indicator bacteria in sediments cores from the largest  freshwater lake of Western Europe (Lake Geneva, Switzerland).
AB  - This study characterized the fecal indicator bacteria (FIB), including Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Enteroccocus (ENT), disseminated over time in the Bay of Vidy, which is the most contaminated area of Lake Geneva. Sediments were collected from a site located at approximately 500 m from the present waste water treatment plant (WWTP) outlet pipe, in front of the former WWTP outlet pipe, which was located at only 300 m from the coastal recreational area (before 2001). E. coli and ENT were enumerated in sediment suspension using the membrane filter method. The FIB characterization was performed for human Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis) and Enterococcus faecium (E. faecium) and human specific bacteroides by PCR using specific primers and a matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). Bacterial cultures revealed that maximum values of 35.2 x 10(8) and 6.6 x 10(6)CFU g(-1) dry sediment for E. coli and ENT, respectively, were found in the sediments deposited following eutrophication of Lake Geneva in the 1970s, whereas the WWTP started operating in 1964. The same tendency was observed for the presence of human fecal pollution: the percentage of PCR amplification with primers ESP-1/ESP-2 for E. faecalis and E. faecium indicated that more than 90% of these bacteria were from human origin. Interestingly, the PCR assays for specific-human bacteroides HF183/HF134 were positive for DNA extracted from all isolated strains of sediment surrounding WWPT outlet pipe discharge. The MALDI-TOF MS confirmed the presence of general E. coli and predominance E. faecium in isolated strains. Our results demonstrated that human fecal bacteria highly increased in the sediments contaminated with WWTP effluent following the eutrophication of Lake Geneva. Additionally, other FIB cultivable strains from animals or adapted environmental strains were detected in the sediment of the bay. The approaches used in this research are valuable to assess the temporal distribution and the source of the human fecal pollution in aquatic environments.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Carpolobia lutea extracts and fractions.
AB  - Carpolobia lutea (G. Don) (Polygalaceae) is a tropical medicinal plant putative in traditional medicines against gonorrhea, gingivitis, infertility, antiulcer and malaria. The present study evaluated the antimicrobial, antifungal and antihelicobacter effects of extracts C. lutea leaf, stem and root. The extracts were examined using the disc-diffusion and Microplates of 96 wells containing Muller-Hinton methods against some bacterial strains: Eschericia coli (ATCC 25922), E. coli (ATCC10418), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923), Staphyllococus aureus (ATCC 6571), Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29212) and Bacillus subtilis (NCTC 8853) and four clinical isolates: one fungi (Candida albican) and three bacteria (Salmonella, Sheigella and staphylococcus aureus). The Gram-positive bacteria: Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923), Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29212), Bacillus subtilis (ATCC 19659) and the Gram-negative bacteria: Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853), Candida albicans (ATCC 18804) and Helicobacter pylori (ATCC 43504). Some of these extracts were found to be active against some tested strains but activity against H. pylori was >1000mg/ml and good fungistatic activity against C. albican. The MIC against C. albican is in the order n-HF > CHF > ETF= EAF.The order of potency of fraction was the ethanol root > n-HF leaf > ethanol fraction stem > chloroform fraction leaf = ethyl acetate fraction leaf. Polyphenols were demonstrated in ethanol fraction, ethyl acetate fraction, crude ethyl acetate extract and ethanol extract, respectively. These polyphenols isolated may partly explain and support the use of C. lutea for the treatment of infectious diseases in traditional Ibibio medicine of Nigeria.
TI  - Nanoscale surface modification favors benign biofilm formation and impedes adherence by pathogens.
AB  - We have found in vitro that a biofilm of benign Escherichia coli 83972 interferes with urinary catheter colonization by pathogens, and in human studies E. coli 83972-coated urinary catheters are associated with lower rates of catheter-associated urinary tract infections. We hypothesized that modifying surfaces to present mannose ligands for the type 1 fimbriae of E. coli would promote formation of dense E. coli 83972 biofilms, thereby interfering with surface colonization by Enterococcus faecalis, a common uropathogen. We covalently immobilized mannose on silicon substrates by attaching amino-terminated mannose derivative to carboxylic acid-terminated monolayers via amidation. Fluorescence microscopy showed that E. coli 83972 adherence to mannose-modified surfaces increased 4.4-fold compared to unmodified silicon surfaces. Pre-exposing mannose-modified surfaces to E. coli 83972 established a protective biofilm that reduced E. faecalis adherence by 83-fold. Mannose-fimbrial interactions were essential for the improved E. coli 83927 adherence and interference effects. From the Clinical Editor: Recurrent urinary tract infections remain major adverse events associated with catheter use. The authors report that modifying catheter surface to present mannose ligands for the type 1 fimbriae of benign Escherichia coli 83972 promotes formation of dense E. coli biofilms, which 100-fold reduces urinary catheter colonization of uropathogens. Future application of this technology is expected to result in substantial UTI risk reduction in catheter users.
TI  - Nanostructured silver vanadate as a promising antibacterial additive to water-based paints.
AB  - In this article, we report the use of nanostructured silver vanadate as a promising antibacterial additive to water-based paints that has potential for applications in bathrooms, kitchens, and hospital environments. This hybrid nanomaterial was prepared by a simple and fast precipitation reaction involving silver nitrate and ammonium vanadate, dismissing the hydrothermal treatment. The preparation involved using Ag vanadate nanowires (beta-AgVO(3)) with diameters ranging from 20 to 60 nm and decorated with silver (Ag) nanoparticles (NPs) with diameters ranging from 5 to 40 nm. Results of antibacterial tests show that this hybrid material has a promising antibacterial activity against several types of bacteria strains, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureas (MRSA), Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, and Salmonella enterica Typhimurium. The evaluated material exhibits antibacterial activity 30 times larger than that of Oxacillin. In addition, this nanomaterial was tested as an antibacterial additive to water-based paints, and formulations with 1% show a 4-mm inhibition zone against a MRSA strain.
TI  - A self-loading microfluidic device for determining the minimum inhibitory concentration of antibiotics.
AB  - This article describes a portable microfluidic technology for determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of antibiotics against bacteria. The microfluidic platform consists of a set of chambers molded in poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) that are preloaded with antibiotic, dried, and reversibly sealed to a second layer of PDMS containing channels that connect the chambers. The assembled device is degassed via vacuum prior to its use, and the absorption of gas by PDMS provides the mechanism for actuating and metering the flow of fluid in the microfluidic channels and chambers. During the operation of the device, degas driven flow introduces a suspension of bacterial cells, dissolves the antibiotic, and isolates cells in individual chambers without cross contamination. The growth of bacteria in the chambers in the presence of a pH indicator produces a colorimetric change that can be detected visually using ambient light. Using this device we measured the MIC of vancomycin, tetracycline, and kanamycin against Enterococcus faecalis 1131, Proteus mirabilis HI4320, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli MG1655 and report values that are comparable to standard liquid broth dilution measurements. The device provides a simple method for MIC determination of individual antibiotics against human pathogens that will have applications for clinical and point-of-care medicine. Importantly, this device is designed around simplicity: it requires a single pipetting step to introduce the sample, no additional components or external equipment for its operation, and provides a straightforward visual measurement of cell growth. As the device introduces a novel approach for filling and isolating dead-end microfluidic chambers that does not require valves and actuators, this technology should find applications in other portable assays and devices.
TI  - Influence of NaCl and NaNO3 on sinigrin hydrolysis by foodborne bacteria.
AB  - The glucosinolate sinigrin (SNG) is converted by endogenous plant myrosinase or by bacterial myrosinase-like activity to form the potent antimicrobial allyl isothiocyanate. In order to use SNG as a natural antimicrobial precursor in food, it became important to better understand the ability of bacteria to synthesize the enzyme(s) and understand factors influencing this synthesis at a constant SNG concentration. Eight spoilage, pathogenic, or starter culture bacteria were grown separately in medium containing individual or combined salts with SNG. SNG degradation by the bacteria and the formation of its major degradation product, allyl isothiocyanate, were followed for 12 days at 30 or 35 degrees C. The bacterial strains varied in their ability to metabolize SNG, and this was enhanced by NaCl and/or NaNO(3). SNG hydrolysis took place after 4 days, and the greatest amount occurred by day 12. At 12 days, Escherichia coli O157:H7 showed the greatest capacity to hydrolyze SNG (45.3% degradation), followed by Staphylococcus carnosus (44.57%), while Pseudomonas fluorescens was not active against SNG. The ability of tested strains to metabolize SNG, in decreasing order, was as follows: Escherichia coli O157:H7 > Staphylococcus carnosus > Staphylococcus aureus > Pediococcus pentosaceus > Salmonella Typhimurium > Listeria monocytogenes > Enterococcus faecalis > Pseudomonas fluorescens.
TI  - Anti-bacterial studies on Hemigraphis colorata (Blume) H.G. Hallier and Elephantopus scaber L.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the ethanol, aqueous, chloroform, benzene, acetone and petroleum ether extracts of, Hemigraphis colorata (H. colorata) leaves and stem and Elephantopus scaber (E. scaber) leaves, root and flower for the presence of phyto-constituents and screened the anti-bacterial activity against the selected pathogens. METHODS: The fresh materials were shade dried and powdered using the tissue blender. The dried and powered materials (50 g) were extracted successively with 200 mL of aqueous, acetone, benzene, chloroform, ethanol, and petroleum ether by using Soxhlet extractor for 8 h at a temperature not exceeding the boiling point of the solvent. Aqueous, acetone, benzene, chloroform, ethanol, and petroleum ether extracts were prepared from powdered materials were used for preliminary phytochemical and antimicrobial studies using standard methods. RESULTS: The crude aqueous, acetone, benzene, chloroform, ethanol, and petroleum ether extracts E. scaber leaves, flower and root and H. colorata leaves and stem demonstrated that out of (5x6x12 = 360) tests for the presence or absence of the above compounds, 188 tests gave positive results and the remaining 172 gave negative results. The results of the phytochemical screening revealed that phenol (12/12), carbohydrates (9/12), steroids (8/12), saponins and coumarins (7/12), tannins (6/12), proteins (5/12), carboxylic acid and flavonoids (4/12), xanthoproteins (3/12) and alkaloids (2/12) presence in the crude aqueous, acetone, benzene, chloroform, ethanol, and petroleum ether extracts of H. colorata leaves and stem. The crude aqueous, acetone, benzene, chloroform, ethanol, and petroleum ether extracts E. scaber leaves, flower and root displayed the presence of phenol (18/18), tannin (17/18), carbohydrates (16/18), steroids (14/18), carboxylic acid and coumarins (12/18), saponins (10/18), xanthoprotein (9/18), flavonoids (7/18), protein (4/18) and alkaloids (2/18). The root ethanolic extracts of E. scaber illustrated the highest zone of inhibition against three pathogens viz., Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) (24 mm), Escherichia coli (E. coli) (16 mm) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) (13 mm). The chlorofrom extracts of E. scaber showed the highest zone of inhibition against Bacillus cereus (B. cereus) (12 mm), The leaves ethanolic extracts of E. scaber demonstrated the highest zone of inhibition against three pathogens viz., Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis) (18 mm), Proteus mirabilis (P. mirabilis) (17 mm), Salmonella Typhi (S. typhi) (14 mm) and Enterobacter sp. (11 mm) While the benzene extracts of H. colorata demonstrated maximum zone of inhibition against the pathogen Acinetobacter sp. (14 mm) and S. aureus (12 mm). CONCLUSIONS: It is hoped that this study would direct to the establishment of some compounds that could be used to invent new and more potent antimicrobial drugs of natural origin.
TI  - Chemical constituents of the methanolic extract of leaves of Leiothrix spiralis Ruhland and their antimicrobial activity.
AB  - Chemical fractionation of the methanolic extract of leaves of Leiothrix spiralis  Ruhland afforded the flavonoids luteolin-6-C-beta-D-glucopyranoside (1), 7-methoxyluteolin-6-C-beta-D-glucopyranoside (2), 7-methoxyluteolin-8-C-beta-D-glucopyranoside (3), 4'-methoxyluteolin-6-C-beta-D-glucopyranoside (4), and 6-hydroxy-7-methoxyluteolin (5), and the xanthones 8-carboxymethyl-1,5,6-trihydroxy-3-methoxyxanthone (6), 8-carboxy-methyl-1,3,5,6-tetrahydroxyxanthone (7). Methanolic extract, fractions, and isolated compounds of the leaves of L. spiralis were assayed against Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis and Enterococcus faecalis) and Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella setubal and Helicobacter pylori) and fungi (the yeasts Candida albicans, C. tropicalis, C. krusei and C. parapsilosis). We observed the best minimum inhibitory concentration values for the methanolic extract against Candida parapsilosis, for the fraction 5 + 6 against Gram-negative bacteria E. coli and P. aeruginosa, and compound 7 against all tested Candida strains. The methanolic extract contents suggest that this species may be a promising source of compounds to produce natural phytomedicines.
TI  - Chlorine disinfection of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, total coliforms, Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis: revisiting reclaimed water regulations.
AB  - Pathogenic organisms can be transmitted orally through drinking water or through  skin and mucosae by both direct and indirect contact, and their presence in water thus has a negative impact on public health. In wastewater treatment plants (WWTP), water is disinfected to inactivate pathogens. The quantification of several microbial indicators in aquatic systems is required to estimate the biological quality of such systems. So far, coliform bacteria have been used as traditional indicators world-wide. This study has assessed the resistance of total coliforms, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus faecalis to three dosages of sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) at two exposure times. The bacteria were isolated from secondary effluents of a WWTP located in Hidalgo, Mexico. The results show that the number of colony-forming units of all studied bacterial types decreased when both the NaClO concentration and exposure times increased. However, they were not eliminated. The inclusion of the species Pseudomonas aeruginosa in regulations for treated wastewater quality as a new indicator is highly recommended due to its importance as an opportunistic pathogen. The detection of this species along with the traditional organisms could be particulary significant for reclaimed water to be used with direct human contact.
TI  - Pharmacological, genotoxic and phytochemical properties of selected South African medicinal plants used in treating stomach-related ailments.
AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: The evaluated medicinal plants are used in South  African traditional medicine in treating stomach-related ailments. AIMS OF THE STUDY: The study aimed at evaluating the pharmacological, genotoxic and phytochemical properties of the seven selected medicinal plants used for treating stomach-related ailments. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ethyl acetate (EtOAc), ethanol (EtOH) 70% and water extracts of the selected plant parts were evaluated for their antimicrobial and anthelmintic activities using microdilution assays. Gram-positive bacteria (Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus), Gram-negative bacterium (Escherichia coli) and Candida albicans were used for antimicrobial assays. Caenorhabditis elegans was used for the anthelmintic assay. Plant extracts were also assayed for their cyclooxygenase-inhibitory activity against cyclooxygenase-1 and -2 enzymes. The Ames test was used to evaluate the genotoxicity of the plant extracts. A spectrophotometric method was used to determine the total phenolics, gallotannins, flavonoids and saponins. RESULTS: Twelve extracts exhibited minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) <1 mg/mL against the bacterial test strains, and five extracts exhibited MIC <1 mg/mL against Candida albicans. The EtOAc extract of Tetradenia riparia had the best minimum lethal concentration (MLC) value (0.004 mg/mL) against Caenorhabditis elegans. All the EtOAc extracts exhibited percentage inhibition in the range of 50.7-94.7% against COX-1 and -2 enzymes at 250 mug/mL. All the plant extracts were non-mutagenic towards Salmonella typhimurium tester strains TA98, TA100 and TA1537 without metabolic activation. Phytochemical analysis revealed relatively high amounts of total phenolics, gallotannins and flavonoids in the evaluated plant extracts. CONCLUSIONS: The general pharmacological activities exhibited by some of the plant extracts in this study support the traditional uses of the selected plants in treating stomach-related ailments. The Ames test showed that all the plant extracts were non-mutagenic but cytotoxicity tests are needed to ascertain the safety for long-term consumption.
TI  - Green fluorescent protein-labeled monitoring tool to quantify conjugative plasmid transfer between Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - On the basis of pIP501, a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged monitoring tool  was constructed for quantifying plasmid mobilization among Gram-positive bacteria and between Gram-positive Enterococcus faecalis and Gram-negative Escherichia coli. Furthermore, retromobilization of the GFP-tagged monitoring tool was shown from E. faecalis OG1X into the clinical isolate E. faecalis T9.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of some African medicinal plants used traditionally against infectious diseases.
AB  - CONTEXT: Plants are known to play a crucial role in African traditional medicine  for the treatment of infection diseases. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the claimed antimicrobial properties of plants traditionally used in African countries, providing scientific validation for their use. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty-three polar and non-polar extracts from 22 medicinal plants were screened for their antibacterial activity against Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis) and Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae) and Mycobacterium smegmatis using the broth microdilution method. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: In vitro antibacterial activity against one or more tested bacteria was shown by 83% of the extracts. The highest activity was obtained with the methanol extracts of the aerial parts of Acacia karroo Hayne (Fabaceae) and Anacardium occidentale L. (Anacardiaceae) and the roots of Bridelia cathartica G. Bertol (Euphorbiaceae), against S. aureus (minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) = 7.5 microg/mL). The same MIC values were exhibited against E. faecalis by the methanol extract of A. occidentale, the dichloromethane and methanol extracts of B. cathartica and the ethyl acetate extract of Momordica balsamina l. (Curcubitaceae) leaves. Gram-negative bacteria were less sensitive; the growth of P. aeruginosa was significantly inhibited (MIC = 31 microg/mL) by the n-hexane and methanol extracts of Gomphocarpus fruticosus (l.) Ait. (Asclepiadaceae) fruits and by the dichloromethane extract of Trichilia emetica Vahl (Meliaceae) seeds. Most of the active extracts were rich in fenols/flavonoids. CONCLUSION: This study supports the use of most of the studied plants in traditional medicine, for the treatment of infectious diseases. Some of them are worthy of further investigation.
TI  - Substrate specificity of bacterial prolyl-tRNA synthetase editing domain is controlled by a tunable hydrophobic pocket.
AB  - Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases catalyze the covalent attachment of amino acids onto their cognate tRNAs. High fidelity in this reaction is crucial to the accurate decoding of genetic information and is ensured, in part, by proofreading of the newly synthesized aminoacyl-tRNAs. Prolyl-tRNA synthetases (ProRS) mischarge tRNA(Pro) with alanine or cysteine due to their smaller or similar sizes relative to cognate proline. Mischarged Ala-tRNA(Pro) is hydrolyzed by an editing domain (INS) present in most bacterial ProRSs. In contrast, the INS domain is unable to deacylate Cys-tRNA(Pro), which is hydrolyzed exclusively by a freestanding trans-editing domain known as YbaK. Here, we have used computational and experimental approaches to probe the molecular basis of INS domain alanine specificity. We show that the methyl side chain of alanine binds in a well defined hydrophobic pocket characterized by conserved residues Ile-263, Leu-266, and Lys-279 and partially conserved residue Thr-277 in Escherichia coli ProRS. Site-specific mutation of these residues leads to a significant loss in Ala-tRNA(Pro) hydrolysis, and altering the size of the pocket modulates the substrate specificity. Remarkably, one ProRS INS domain variant displays a complete switch in substrate specificity from alanine to cysteine. The mutually exclusive aminoacyl-tRNA substrate specificities of the WT and engineered INS domains is consistent with the evolution of two distinct editing domains that function to clear Ala-tRNA(Pro) and Cys-tRNA(Pro) in vivo.
TI  - Fate of pathogens in a simulated bioreduction system for livestock carcasses.
AB  - The EU Animal By-Products Regulations generated the need for novel methods of storage and disposal of dead livestock. Bioreduction prior to rendering or incineration has been proposed as a practical and potentially cost-effective method; however, its biosecurity characteristics need to be elucidated. To address this, Salmonella enterica (serovars Senftenberg and Poona), Enterococcus faecalis, Campylobacter jejuni, Campylobacter coli and a lux-marked strain of Escherichia coli O157 were inoculated into laboratory-scale bioreduction vessels containing sheep carcass constituents. Numbers of all pathogens and the metabolic activity of E. coli O157 decreased significantly within the liquor waste over time, and only E. faecalis remained detectable after 3months. Only very low numbers of Salmonella spp. and E. faecalis were detected in bioaerosols, and only at initial stages of the trial. These results further indicate that bioreduction represents a suitable method of storing and reducing the volume of livestock carcasses prior to ultimate disposal.
TI  - Evaluation of wound healing and antimicrobial potentials of Ixora coccinea root extract.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the wound healing and antimicrobial activity of root extracts of Ixora coccinea (I. coccinea). METHODS: To investigate the wound healing efficacy of root extract of I. coccinea Linn, five groups of animals were divided each containing six animals. Two wound models including incision and excision wound models were used in this study. The parameters studied were tensile strength on incision wound model and in terms of wound contraction for excision wound model were compared with standard Nitrofurazone (NFZ) ointment (0.2% w/w). Six extracts (ethanol, aqueous, petroleum ether, benzene, chloroform and ethyl acetate) of I. coccinea were screened for in vitro growth inhibiting activity against different bacterial strains viz, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus pumilius, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and fungi Candida albicans and Aspergillus niger were compared with the standard drugs ciprofloxacin and chloramphenicol for antibacterial and griseofulvin for antifungal screening. The serial dilution and cup (or) well plate methods were used for the antimicrobial study and MIC was determined. RESULTS: The ethanolic extract showed significant (P<0.001) wound healing activity when compared to standard drug NFZ with respect to normal control group. Amongst all, ethanolic extract showed highly significant antibacterial activity against all bacterial strains used in this study when compared to standard. The aqueous extract showed moderate significant inhibition against all bacterial strains when compared to standard. All the extracts were shown negligible activity against the fungal strains used in this study. CONCLUSIONS: The ethanolic root extract of I. coccinea showed pronounced wound healing and antibacterial activity. The probable reason to heal the wound was that the external application of the extract prevented the microbes to invade through the wound thus the protection of wound occurs against the infection of the various organisms.
TI  - Microbiological findings in endometrial specimen: our experience.
AB  - PURPOSE: Collection of an endometrial specimen for investigating infectious agents in the endometrial cavity is an invasive technique that is at times difficult and painful. In order to avoid the need for endometrial sampling in the cases of suspected or evident endometrial pathology, the aim of this study is to investigate the reliability of cervical cultures for detecting infectious agents present at the endometrial level, comparing the results between cervical cultures and endometrial cultures in women with clinical signs of endometrial inflammation. METHODS: In a prospective diagnostic study, in the period from January 2009 to October 2010, we enrolled 404 women referred to the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology for diagnostic hysteroscopy. All the patients underwent cervical and endometrial sampling. Cultures for common bacteria, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, yeast, and Ureaplasma urealyticum were performed. RESULTS: The most frequent infectious agents detected at the endometrial level were common bacteria, which accounted for 69% of all cases. In particular, streptococci were found in 27% of cases, and bacteria from intestinal flora (Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli) was recovered in 31% of cases. U. urealyticum was detected in 10% and Mycoplasma in only one patient (0.2% of cases). No cases of N. gonorrhoeae were found. CONCLUSIONS: Cervical culture has a low concordance with endometrial culture. In fact in only 33% of cases was the microorganism found in the cervix the same as that found in the endometrium. These results infer that an endometrial culture is a useful investigative tool for determining the microorganisms in endometrial pathology.
TI  - Activity of tigecycline and comparators against skin and skin structure pathogens: global results of the Tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial, 2004-2009.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This analysis from the global Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (T.E.S.T.) reports on 24 784 isolates collected from integumentary culture sources between 2004 and 2009. METHODS: Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and susceptibility were determined according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines (US Food and Drug Administration breakpoints applied against tigecycline). RESULTS: All methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus were susceptible to tigecycline, linezolid, and vancomycin. MIC(90)s for tigecycline against Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium ranged between 0.12 mg/l and 0.25mg/l. Resistance to the carbapenems and tigecycline was low among the Enterobacteriaceae, with resistance at </= 2.0% between 2004 and 2009 for tigecycline against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter spp, and Serratia marcescens, for imipenem against E. coli and Enterobacter spp, and for meropenem against E. coli, Enterobacter spp, and S. marcescens. Against the Acinetobacter baumannii collected in 2009, resistance to amikacin, ceftazidime, levofloxacin, meropenem, and piperacillin-tazobactam was >30%; between 2004 and 2009 resistance to minocycline varied between 1.4% and 4.8%, and tigecycline MIC(90)s were </= 2mg/l. Against the Pseudomonas aeruginosa collected, MIC(90)s were greater than the susceptibility breakpoint for cefepime, ceftazidime, imipenem, levofloxacin, and meropenem. CONCLUSIONS: The problem of antimicrobial resistance is demonstrated by the data presented. T.E.S.T. continues to provide valuable information on antimicrobial resistance globally.
TI  - High-level resistance to gentamicin: genetic transfer between Enterococcus faecalis isolated from food of animal origin and human microbiota.
AB  - AIMS: To investigate the in vivo gene transfer of high-level gentamicin resistance (HLRG) from Enterococcus faecalis isolated from the food of animal origin to a human isolate, using a mouse model of intestinally colonized human microbiota. METHODS AND RESULTS: In vitro study: The presence of plasmids involved in HLRG coding was investigated. After the conjugation experiment, the recipient strain, Ent. faecalis JH2-SS, acquired a plasmid responsible for HLRG [minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) >800 mug ml(-1) ], in a similar position to the donor cells. In vivo study: Seven BALB/c mice were dosed with ceftriaxone (400 mg kg(-1) ) and then inoculated with a dilution of 1/100 of human faeces (HFc). After 72 h, Ent. faecalis JH2-SS (recipient) was inoculated and then, after a further 72 h, the animals were given Ent. faecalis CS19, isolated from the food of animal origin, involved in HLRG (donor). The presence of transconjugant strains in HFc was subsequently recorded on a daily basis until the end of the experiment. The clonal relationship between Ent. faecalis and Escherichia coli in faeces was assessed by RAPD-PCR. Both the in vitro and in vivo studies showed that the receptor strain acquired a plasmid responsible for HLRG (MICs >800 mug ml(-1) ), which migrated with a similar relative mobility value. Transconjugant strains were detected from 24 h after the donor strain inoculation and persisted until the end of the experiment. CONCLUSIONS: The in vivo gene transfer of HLRG from Ent. faecalis strains, isolated from the food of animal origin, to human microbiota has been demonstrated in a mouse model. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The complexity found on the therapeutic responses of invasive infectious diseases caused by Ent. faecalis facilitates the assessment of food of animal origin as a resistant pathogen reservoir. In addition, this study may contribute to the understanding of antimicrobials' resistance gene transfer between Ent. faecalis strains from food and human GI tract.
TI  - The age-related risk of co-existing meningitis in children with urinary tract infection.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The primary aim of this study was to determine age-stratified rates of co-existing bacterial meningitis in children with urinary tract infection (UTI). The secondary aims of this study were to determine the causative pathogens of UTI, and the clinical features and outcome of children with co-existing meningitis. METHODS: Analysis of data collected over a nine-year period at a tertiary pediatric hospital in Australia. STUDY POPULATION: children below 16 years of age with culture-confirmed UTI and a paired CSF sample. RESULTS: A total of 748 episodes in 735 cases were included in the final analysis. The commonest pathogens causing UTI were Escherichia coli (67.4%), Enterococcus faecalis (8.4%), Klebsiella oxytoca (3.5%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (3.5%). Only two (1.2%; 95% CI: 0.15-4.36%) of 163 neonates (between 0 and 28 days of age) with UTI had co-existing meningitis. Both presented with pyrexia, irritability and lethargy, and recovered uneventfully with antibiotic treatment. There were no cases of co-existing meningitis among 499 infants (between 29 days and 12 months of age) with UTI (95% CI: 0.00-0.74%), or any of the 86 children aged 12 months or over (95% CI: 0.00-4.20%). CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that clinicians should have a low threshold to perform a lumbar puncture in neonates with UTI, as the risk of co-existing meningitis is not insignificant in this age group. In contrast, beyond the neonatal period, the risk is small and a more selective approach is warranted.
TI  - Intestinal bacterial translocation in rats with cirrhosis is related to compromised Paneth cell antimicrobial host defense.
AB  - Liver cirrhosis is associated with bacterial translocation (BT) and endotoxemia.  Most translocating bacteria belong to the common intestinal microbiota, suggesting a breakdown of intestinal barrier function. We hypothesized that diminished mucosal antimicrobial host defense could predispose to BT. Two rodent models of portal hypertension with increased BT were used, CCl(4)-induced ascitic cirrhosis and 2-day portal vein-ligated (PVL) animals. BT was assessed by standard microbiological techniques on mesenteric lymph nodes. Total RNA was isolated systematically throughout the intestinal tract, and expression of Paneth cell alpha-cryptdins and beta-defensins was determined by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). To determine functional consequences, mucosal antimicrobial activity was assessed with a fluorescence-activated cell sorting assay. BT was detectable in 40% of rats with cirrhosis. Compared with the group without BT, these animals exhibited diminished intestinal Paneth cell alpha-cryptdin 5 and 7 expression. In contrast, PVL was associated with BT in all animals but did not affect antimicrobial peptides. The decrease in Paneth cell antimicrobials was most pronounced in the ileum and the coecum. Other antimicrobials showed no changes or even an induction in the case of BT at different sites. Antimicrobial activity toward different commensal strains was reduced, especially in the distal ileum and the cecum in experimental cirrhosis with BT (excluding PVL). CONCLUSION: Compromised Paneth cell antimicrobial host defense seems to predispose to BT in experimental cirrhosis. Understanding this liver-gut axis including the underlying mechanisms could help us to find new treatment avenues.
TI  - Functionalized arrays of Raman-enhancing nanoparticles for capture and culture-free analysis of bacteria in human blood.
AB  - Detecting bacteria in clinical samples without using time-consuming culture processes would allow rapid diagnoses. Such a culture-free detection method requires the capture and analysis of bacteria from a body fluid, which are usually of complicated composition. Here we show that coating Ag-nanoparticle arrays with vancomycin (Van) can provide label-free analysis of bacteria via surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), leading to a ~1,000-fold increase in bacteria capture, without introducing significant spectral interference. Bacteria from human blood can be concentrated onto a microscopic Van-coated area while blood cells are excluded. Furthermore, a Van-coated substrate provides distinctly different SERS spectra of Van-susceptible and Van-resistant Enterococcus, indicating its potential use for drug-resistance tests. Our results represent a critical step towards the creation of SERS-based multifunctional biochips for rapid culture- and label-free detection and drug-resistant testing of microorganisms in clinical samples.
TI  - Development of an antibiogram in a long-term care facility.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To create an antibiogram-a profile of an organism's susceptibility/resistance to a panel of antibiotics- for a long-term care facility to assess the prevalence of resistance of bacteria present at the facility. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of culture and sensitivity data from July 1, 2009, through June 30, 2010. SETTING: A long-term care facility in Huntsville, Alabama. PATIENTS AND PARTICIPANTS: Residents of the long-term care facility that had one or more culture and sensitivity test performed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Susceptibility of bacteria to each antimicrobial tested. RESULTS: Results were compiled and reported according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute Analysis and Presentation of Cumulative Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test Data. The most commonly seen bacteria in our long-term care facility were Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus mirabilis. Resistance rates for these bacteria were high and included the presence of methicillinresistant S. aureus and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing bacteria. CONCLUSION: Resistance rates were high among all organisms reported. This poses a serious threat to the health care team's ability to effectively treat residents of this facility. Development of an antibiogram to assist physicians in antimicrobial selection will be beneficial in helping evaluate trends in drug resistance to current available treatments. Implementing clinical pathways for empiric treatment of infections could improve the ability to provide consistent treatment for all residents in the facility.
TI  - Enhanced antibacterial activity of bimetallic gold-silver core-shell nanoparticles at low silver concentration.
AB  - Herein we report the development of bimetallic Au@Ag core-shell nanoparticles (NPs) where gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) served as the seeds for continuous deposition of silver atoms on its surface. The core-shell structure and morphology were examined by UV-Vis spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The core-shell NPs showed antibacterial activity against both gram negative (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and gram positive (Enterococcus faecalis and Pediococcus acidilactici) bacteria at low concentration of silver present in the shell, with more efficacy against gram negative bacteria. TEM and flow cytometric studies showed that the core-shell NPs attached to the bacterial surface and caused membrane damage leading to cell death. The enhanced antibacterial properties of Au@Ag core-shell NPs was possibly due to the more active silver atoms in the shell surrounding gold core due to high surface free energy of the surface Ag atoms owing to shell thinness in the bimetallic NP structure.
TI  - DNA, protein binding, cytotoxicity, cellular uptake and antibacterial activities  of new palladium(II) complexes of thiosemicarbazone ligands: effects of substitution on biological activity.
AB  - The coordination propensities of 4(N,N')-diethylaminosalicylaldehyde-4(N)-substituted thiosemicarbazones (H(2)L(1-4)) were investigated by reacting with an equimolar amount of [PdCl(2)(PPh(3))(2)]. The new complexes were characterized by various spectroscopic techniques. The structure determination of the complexes [Pd(DeaSal-tsc)(PPh(3))] (1), [Pd(DeaSal-mtsc)(PPh(3))] (2) and [Pd(DeaSal-etsc)(PPh(3))] (3) by X-ray crystallography showed that ligands are coordinated in a dibasic tridentate ONS donor fashion forming stable five and six membered chelate rings. The binding ability of complexes (1-4) to calf-thymus DNA (CT DNA) has been explored by absorption and emission titration methods. Based on the observations, an electrostatic and an intercalative binding mode have been proposed. The protein binding studies have been monitored by quenching of tryptophan and tyrosine residues in the presence of complexes using lysozyme as a model protein. As determined by MTT assays, complex 3 exhibited a higher cytotoxic effect towards human lung cancer cell line (A549) and liver cancer cells (HepG2). LDH, NO assay and cellular uptake of the complexes have been studied. Further, antibacterial activity studies of the complexes have been screened against the pathogenic bacteria such as Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, MIC50 values of the complexes showed that the complexes exhibited significant activity against the pathogens and among the complexes, 3 exhibited higher activity.
TI  - [Biosynthesis of amorpha-4,11-diene, a precursor of the antimalarial agent artemisinin, in Escherichia coli through introducing mevalonate pathway].
AB  - Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) are recommended to be the most effective therapies for the first-line treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria. However, artemisinin is often in short supply and unaffordable to most malaria patients, which limits the wide use of ACTs. Production of amorpha-4,11-diene, an artemisinin precursor, was investigated by engineering a heterologous isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway in Escherichia coli. The production of amorpha-4,11-diene was achieved by expression of a synthetic amorpha-4,11-diene synthase gene in Escherichia coli DHGT7 and further improved by about 13.3 fold through introducing the mevalonate pathway from Enterococcus faecalis. After eliminating three pathway bottlenecks including amorpha-4,11-diene synthase, HMG-CoA reducase and mevalonate kinase by optimizing the metabolic flux, the yield of amorpha-4,11-diene was increased by nearly 7.2 fold and reached at 235 mg/L in shaking flask culture. In conclusion, an engineered Escherichia coli was constructed for high-level production of amorpha-4,11-diene.
TI  - Scleroderma digital ulcers complicated by infection with fecal pathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Digital ulcers represent one of the most frequent complications of systemic sclerosis (SSc; scleroderma); they are very painful, scarcely responsive to treatment, and often responsible for marked limitations on daily activities, including patient self-care. Infectious complications may severely compromise the outcome of skin lesions in a significant percentage of patients. Numerous pathogens of different origin may be involved, including bacteria from patient endogenous flora. Here we evaluated the possible involvement of fecal pathogens in scleroderma digital ulcers. METHODS: Among a series of 82 SSc patients with digital ulcers, we retrospectively analyzed 42 subjects with clinical signs of local bacterial infection. All digital ulcers with suspected infection have been investigated by microbiologic examinations. RESULTS: Bacterial infection was confirmed in all 42 patients investigated; in particular, Staphylococcus aureus were the most frequently found (50%). Interestingly, 11 (26%) of 42 patients showed digital ulcers infected with intestinal bacteria; specifically, 7 patients were positive for Escherichia coli and 4 for Enterococcus faecalis. Diffuse cutaneous SSc patients were more numerous in this subgroup versus the other 31 patients (Fisher's P = 0.011). CONCLUSION: A number of effective measures involving health care personnel and hospital environment are essential in the management of digital ulcers and prevention of infectious complications. In addition, the prevalence of fecal pathogens in one-quarter of cases, never reported previously, suggests an important role of a patient's self-care limitations, mainly during intercurrent home medications. Consequently, methodical education on hand hygiene of both patients and relatives, frequently involved in ulcer medications, is mandatory to avoid such deleterious complications.
TI  - Comparison of cefpodoxime proxetil release and antimicrobial activity from tablet formulations: complexation with hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin in the presence of water soluble polymer.
AB  - This study aims to prove the complexation of cefpodoxime proxetil (CP) by hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HP-beta-CD) in the presence of sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (Na CMC), and makes a comparison of commercial tablets by dissolution and antimicrobial activity studies. The CP--HP-beta-CD complex was prepared by kneading method and characterized by SEM, FTIR and DSC. The solubility method was used to investigate the effect of HP-beta-CD and Na CMC on the solubility of CP. The complex tablets were prepared using direct compression method. Dissolution studies were performed with complex tablets and commercial tablets in pH 1.2, 4.5, 6.8 and 7.4 buffer solutions. It was observed that complexation occurred in all formulations, and HP-beta-CD is able to increase CP solubility and dissolution rate of CP was improved from complex tablets, when compared with commercial tablets. Furthermore, the antimicrobial activity studies revealed that the CP--HP-beta-CD complex and complex tablets were shown to have more effective antimicrobial activity than commercial tablets. It is evident from the results that complexation with HP-beta-CD in the presence of Na CMC is feasible way to prepare a more efficient tablet formulation with improved dissolution and antimicrobial activity.
TI  - [Evaluation of chromogenic medium Uriselect4 in urine culture].
AB  - We evaluated the performance and the cost of chromogenic medium Uriselect4 agar with regard to the standard medium for the detection and identification of urinary tract pathogens. A total of 503 clinical urine specimens containing leucocytes greater or equal to 104/mL were analysed prospectively, in parallel by two different persons on blood agar (GS) and Uriselect4 according to the manufacturers' instructions. Of the 503 urine specimens tested, 210 gave a positive culture on Uriselect4 versus 181 on GS. The majority of bacterial species grew on both media; enterobacteria grew on Uriselect4 better than GS. The identification of Escherichia coli (E. coli), Proteus mirabilis (P. mirabilis), KES group and Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis) did not require the use of galleries Api and has a gain of 24 h. Positive pure cultures on Uriselect4 corresponding to negative cultures of GS were noted in 17 ases. Conversely, in seven cases a positive pure culture on GS was noted while the corresponding Uriselect4 cultures were negative. The cost of identification on GS (including the cost of galleries Api), was about two times higher than Uriselect4. Uriselect4 medium isolates the most frequent urinary tract pathogens and identify them so almost immediately, with a lower cost.
TI  - Synthesis, antimicrobial and antiproliferative activity of novel silver(I) tris(pyrazolyl)methanesulfonate and 1,3,5-triaza-7-phosphadamantane complexes.
AB  - Five new silver(I) complexes of formulas [Ag(Tpms)] (1), [Ag(Tpms)(PPh(3))] (2),  [Ag(Tpms)(PCy(3))] (3), [Ag(PTA)][BF(4)] (4), and [Ag(Tpms)(PTA)] (5) {Tpms = tris(pyrazol-1-yl)methanesulfonate, PPh(3) = triphenylphosphane, PCy(3) = tricyclohexylphosphane, PTA = 1,3,5-triaza-7-phosphaadamantane} have been synthesized and fully characterized by elemental analyses, (1)H, (13)C, and (31)P NMR, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), and IR spectroscopic techniques. The single crystal X-ray diffraction study of 3 shows the Tpms ligand acting in the N(3)-facially coordinating mode, while in 2 and 5 a N(2)O-coordination is found, with the SO(3) group bonded to silver and a pendant free pyrazolyl ring. Features of the tilting in the coordinated pyrazolyl rings in these cases suggest that this inequivalence is related with the cone angles of the phosphanes. A detailed study of antimycobacterial and antiproliferative properties of all compounds has been carried out. They were screened for their in vitro antimicrobial activities against the standard strains Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29922), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923), Streptococcus pneumoniae (ATCC 49619), Streptococcus pyogenes (SF37), Streptococcus sanguinis (SK36), Streptococcus mutans (UA159), Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), and the fungus Candida albicans (ATCC 24443). Complexes 1-5 have been found to display effective antimicrobial activity against the series of bacteria and fungi, and some of them are potential candidates for antiseptic or disinfectant drugs. Interaction of Ag complexes with deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) has been studied by fluorescence spectroscopic techniques, using ethidium bromide (EB) as a fluorescence probe of DNA. The decrease in the fluorescence of DNA-EB system on addition of Ag complexes shows that the fluorescence quenching of DNA-EB complex occurs and compound 3 is particularly active. Complexes 1-5 exhibit pronounced antiproliferative activity against human malignant melanoma (A375) with an activity often higher than that of AgNO(3), which has been used as a control, following the same order of activity inhibition on DNA, i.e., 3 > 2 > 1 > 5 > AgNO(3)>> 4.
TI  - Novel conjugation of norvancomycin-fluorescein for photodynamic inactivation of Bacillus subtilis.
AB  - A simple and unique conjugation of norvancomycin-fluorescein (VanF) has been achieved. It was characterized by UV-vis and fluorescence spectra and confirmed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrum. The photodynamic assay indicated that VanF effectively inactivated the Gram-positive Bacillus subtilis (ATCC 6633) from clinic with inactivation rate of 30-70% within 1-7.5 muM. In vitro, VanF showed low antimicrobial activity with value of >128 mug/mL, binding affinity with value of 180 nM per 10(8) cells/mL against the bacteria strains. The fluorescence imaging showed that VanF could label the B. subtilis strain, but not the Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 51299, VanD), and VRE strains from clinic.
TI  - Comparative study of antimicrobial activity and phytochemical analysis of methanolic and aqueous extracts of the fruit of Emblica officinalis against pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate antimicrobial potential of aqueous (infusions, decoctions) and methanlic extracts (1:2 and 1:5 concentrations) of Emblica officinalis (amla) against seven pathogenic bacteria namely Staphylococcs aureus, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus cloacae, Proteus vulgaris and Klebsiella pneumoniae. METHODS: The well diffusion technique was employed. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined using micro-broth dilution methods and phytochemical screening was done as per standard procedures. RESULTS: Aqueous infusion extract of amla exhibited potent antimicrobial activity against E. cloacae followed by E. coli. Preliminary phytochemical analysis of E. officinalis aqueous extracts (infusions and decoctions) only showed presence of tannins, saponins, flavanoids, Terpenoids and phenols. MIC of aqueous extract of E. officinalis was most active against K. pneumoniae. Whereas MIC of methanol extract of E. officinalis shows maximum activity against E. coli. CONCLUSION: Emblica officinalis definitely possesses potent antimicrobial activities and this can serve as an important platform for the development of inexpensive, safe and effective medicines
TI  - Predictors of in-hospital mortality in elderly patients with bacteraemia admitted to an Internal Medicine ward.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Infectious diseases are a common cause of increased morbidity and mortality in elderly patients. Bacteraemia in the elderly is a difficult diagnosis and a therapeutic challenge due to age-related vicissitudes and to their comorbidities. The main purpose of the study was to assess independent risk factors for in-hospital mortality among the elderly with bacteraemia admitted to an Internal Medicine Ward. METHODS: Overall, a cohort of 135 patients, 65 years of age and older, with bacteraemia were retrospectively studied. Data related to demographic information, comorbidities, clinical parameters on admission, source and type of infection, microorganism isolated in the blood culture, laboratory data and empirical antibiotic treatment was recorded from each patient. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to identify independent predictors of all-cause in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: Of these 135 patients, 45.9% were women. The most common infections in this group of patients were urinary tract infections (46.7%). The main microorganisms isolated in the blood cultures were Escherichia coli (14.9%), Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (12.0%), non-MRSA (11.4%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (9.1%) and Enterococcus faecalis (8.0%). The in-hospital mortality was 22.2%. Independent prognostic factors associated with in-hospital mortality were age >/= 85 years, chronic renal disease, bacteraemia of unknown focus and cognitive impairment at admission (OR, 2.812 [95% CI, 1.039-7.611; p = 0.042]; OR, 6.179 [95% CI, 1.840-20.748; p = 0.003]; OR, 8.673 [95% CI, 1.557-48.311; p = 0.014] and OR, 3.621 [95% CI, 1.226-10.695; p = 0.020], respectively). By multivariate analysis appropriate antibiotic therapy was not associated with lower odds of mortality. CONCLUSION: Bacteraemia in the elderly has a high mortality rate. There are no set of signs or clinical features that can predict bacteraemia in the elderly. However, older age (>/= 85 years), chronic renal disease, bacteraemia of unknown focus and severe cognitive impairment adversely affects the outcome of elderly patients with bacteraemia admitted to an Internal Medicine ward.
TI  - Phytochemical constituents and antibacterial efficacy of the flowers of Peltophorum pterocarpum (DC.) Baker ex Heyne.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the preliminary phytochemistry and antibacterial activity of the flower extract of Peltophorum pterocarpum . METHODS: Phytochemical analysis was done by using the standard methods given by Harbone. The methanolic flower extract were tested against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Salmonella typhi, Serratia marsecens, Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterobacter sp., Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus pyogenes by the agar disc diffusion method. RESULTS: Preliminary phytochemical screening of flower extract showed the presence of phenolic compounds, flavonoids, saponins, steroids, tannins, xanthoproteins, carboxylic acids, coumarins and carbohydrates. The flower extract of Peltophorum pterocarpum showed significant activity against four gram positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus pyogenes) and three gram negative bacteria (Proteus mirabilis, Acinetobacter baumannii and Serratia marsecens), out of 12 pathogenic bacteria studied. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the present study confirm the presence of significant antibacterial activity against human pathogens in the flowers of Peltophorum pterocarpum.
TI  - The revival of fosfomycin.
AB  - Fosfomycin, originally named phosphonomycin, was discovered in Spain in 1969. There are three forms of fosfomycin: fosfomycin tromethamine (a soluble salt) and fosfomycin calcium for oral use, and fosfomycin disodium for intravenous use. Fosfomycin is a bactericidal antibiotic that interferes with cell wall synthesis in both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria by inhibiting the initial step involving phosphoenolpyruvate synthetase. It has a broad spectrum of activity against a wide range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. It is highly active against Gram-positive pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus, and against Gram-negative bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Its unique mechanism of action may provide a synergistic effect to other classes of antibiotics including beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, and fluoroquinolones. Oral fosfomycin is mainly used in the treatment of urinary tract infections, particularly those caused by Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis. Intravenous fosfomycin has been administered in combination with other antibiotics for the treatment of nosocomial infections due to multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Fosfomycin has good distribution into tissues, achieving clinically relevant concentrations in serum, kidneys, bladder wall, prostate, lungs, inflamed tissues, bone, cerebrospinal fluid, abscess fluid, and heart valves. Fosfomycin is well tolerated, with a low incidence of adverse events. Further randomized controlled trials are needed in order to evaluate the efficacy of intravenous fosfomycin for the management of nosocomial infections due to MDR pathogens.
TI  - Synthesis, antioxidant and antimicrobial evaluation of simple aromatic esters of  ferulic acid.
AB  - Aromatic ester derivatives of ferulic acid where the phenolic hydroxyl is free (6a-d) or acetylated (5a-d) were evaluated for their antioxidant and antimicrobial properties. The superoxide radical scavenging capacity of compounds 5d and 6d-e (IC(50) of 0.19, 0.27 and 0.20 mM, respectively) was found to be twice as active as alpha-tocopherol (IC(50) = 0.51 mM). DPPH radical scavenging capacity was moderate and only found in compounds bearing free phenolic hydroxyl groups (6a-e). With regard to antimicrobial properties, compounds 6b and 6c displayed significant activity against Enterococcus faecalis (MICs = 16 mug/mL) and vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis (MIC for 6b, 32 and for 6c, 16 mug/mL). Compound 6c also demonstrated prominent activity against planktonic Staphylococcus aureus with a MIC value of <8 mug/mL and it inhibited bacterial biofilm formation by S. aureus with a MBEC value of <8 mug/mL, which was 64 and 128 times more potent than ofloxacin and vancomycin, respectively.
TI  - Bile culture and susceptibility testing of malignant biliary obstruction via PTBD.
AB  - PURPOSE: To assess the information obtained by bile culture and susceptibility testing for malignant biliary obstruction by a retrospective one-center study. METHODS: A total of 694 patients with malignant biliary obstruction received percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage during the period July 2003 to September 2010, and subsequently, bile specimens were collected during the procedure. Among the 694 patients, 485 were men and 209 were women, ranging in age from 38 to 78 years (mean age 62 years). RESULTS: A total of 42.9% patients had a positive bile culture (298 of 694). Further, 57 species of microorganisms and 342 strains were identified; gram-positive bacteria accounted for 50.9% (174 of 342) and gram-negative bacteria accounted for 41.5% (142 of 342) of these strains. No anaerobes were obtained by culture during this study. The most common microorganisms were Enterococcus faecalis (41 of 342, 11.9%), Escherichia coli (34 of 342, 9.9%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (28 of 342, 8.2%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (19 of 342, 5.5%), Enterococcus (18 of 342, 5.3%), and Enterobacter cloacae (16 of 342, 4.7%). The percentage of beta-lactamase-producing gram-positive bacteria was 27.6% (48 of 174), and the percentage of gram-negative bacteria was 19.7% (28 of 142). The percentage of enzyme-producing Escherichia coli was 61.7% (21 of 34). CONCLUSION: The bile cultures in malignant biliary obstruction are different from those in the Tokyo Guidelines and other benign biliary obstruction researches, which indicates that a different antibacterial therapy should be applied. Thus, knowledge of the antimicrobial susceptibility data could aid in the better use of antibiotics for the empirical therapy of biliary infection combined with malignant biliary obstruction.
TI  - Synthesis, spectroscopic properties and antipathogenic activity of new thiourea derivatives.
AB  - A number of acylthioureas, 2-((4-methylphenoxy)methyl)-N-(aryl-carbamothioyl)benzamides (aryl = 3,5-dichlorophenyl, 2,3-dichlorophenyl, 3,4-dichloro-phenyl, 2,4,5-trichlorophenyl, 3,4,5-trichlorophenyl, 2-bromophenyl, 2,4-dibromophenyl, 2,5-dibromophenyl, 2-iodophenyl, 3-fluorophenyl, 2,3,4-trifluorophenyl, 2,4,5-trifluoro-phenyl, 2,4,6-trifluorophenyl) have been synthesized, characterized by elemental analysis, IR and NMR spectroscopy and tested for their interaction with bacterial cells in free and adherent state. The anti-pathogenic activity was correlated with the presence of one iodine, bromide or fluorine, and two or three chloride atoms on the N-phenyl substituent of the thiourea moiety, being significant especially on Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus strains, known for their ability to grow in biofilms. Our results demonstrate the potential of these derivatives for further development of novel anti-microbial agents with antibiofilm properties.
TI  - Critical assessment of suitable methods used for determination of antibacterial properties at photocatalytic surfaces.
AB  - This work describes the development of methods necessary for antibacterial effect evaluation on irradiated TiO(2) layers. Two methods using bacteria suspensions and the glass adhesion method (based on ISO 27447:2009(E)) were critically assessed and compared. As test bacteria gram negative Escherichia coli and gram positive Enterococcus faecalis were employed. The method using 50 cm(3) of bacteria suspension is convenient for testing layers with strong antibacterial effect (prepared from powder photocatalysts). For the evaluation of the antibacterial effect of sol gel layers, the glass adhesion method based on the ISO is more appropriate than the method with 3 cm(3) of bacteria suspension. The reason is that the later does not allow a distinction between the inhibition effect of TiO(2) and UV light itself. Some improvements of the ISO method were suggested, namely the use of gelatinous pills (CCM) of bacteria, using saline solution instead of nutrient broth for bacteria suspension preparation and the application of selective media for bacteria cultivation. Decreasing the light intensity from 0.6 mW cm(-2) to 0.2 mW cm(-2) (fulfilling the requirements of the ISO) results in almost negligible effect of UV light itself, thus enabling proper testing of the antibacterial properties of TiO(2) thin films.
TI  - Adaptive evolution of a novel Drosophila lectin induced by parasitic wasp attack.
AB  - Drosophila melanogaster has long been used as a model for the molecular genetics  of innate immunity. Such work has uncovered several immune receptors that recognize bacterial and fungal pathogens by binding unique components of their cell walls and membranes. Drosophila also act as hosts to metazoan pathogens such as parasitic wasps, which can infect a majority of individuals in natural populations, but many aspects of their immune responses against these more closely related pathogens are poorly understood. Here, we present data describing the transcriptional induction and molecular evolution of a candidate Drosophila anti-wasp immunity gene, lectin-24A. Lectin-24A has a secretion signal sequence and its lectin domain suggests a function in sugar group binding. Transcript levels of lectin-24A were induced significantly stronger and faster following wasp attack than following wounding or bacterial infection, demonstrating lectin-24A is not a general stress response or defense response gene but is instead part of a specific response against wasps. The major site of lectin-24A transcript production is the fat body, the main humoral immune tissue of flies. Interestingly, lectin-24A is a new gene of the D. melanogaster/Drosophila simulans clade, displaying very little homology to any other Drosophila lectins. Population genetic analyses of lectin-24A DNA sequence data from African and North American populations of D. melanogaster and D. simulans revealed gene length polymorphisms segregating at high frequencies as well as strong evidence of repeated and recent selective sweeps. Thus, lectin-24A is a rapidly evolving new gene that has seemingly developed functional importance for fly resistance against infection by parasitic wasps.
TI  - Antimicrobial and toxicological activities of five medicinal plant species from Cameroon traditional medicine.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Infectious diseases caused by multiresistant microbial strains are on the increase. Fighting these diseases with natural products may be more efficacious. The aim of this study was to investigate the in vitro antimicrobial activity of methanolic, ethylacetate (EtOAc) and hexanic fractions of five Cameroonian medicinal plants (Piptadeniastum africana, Cissus aralioides, Hileria latifolia, Phyllanthus muellerianus and Gladiolus gregasius) against 10 pathogenic microorganisms of the urogenital and gastrointestinal tracts. METHODS: The fractions were screened for their chemical composition and in vivo acute toxicity was carried out on the most active extracts in order to assess their inhibitory selectivity. The agar well-diffusion and the micro dilution methods were used for the determination of the inhibition diameters (ID) and Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) respectively on 8 bacterial species including two Gram positive species (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis), and six Gram negative (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Shigella flexneri, Salmonella typhi) and two fungal isolates (Candida albicans, Candida krusei). The chemical composition was done according to Harbone (1976), the acute toxicity evaluation according to WHO protocol and the hepatic as well as serum parameters measured to assess liver and kidney functions. RESULTS: The chemical components of each plant's extract varied according to the solvent used, and they were found to contain alkaloids, flavonoids, polyphenols, triterpens, sterols, tannins, coumarins, glycosides, cardiac glycosides and reducing sugars. The methanolic and ethylacetate extracts of Phyllanthus muellerianus and Piptadeniastum africana presented the highest antimicrobial activities against all tested microorganisms with ID varying from 8 to 26 mm and MIC from 2.5 to 0.31 mg/ml. The in vivo acute toxicity study carried out on the methanolic extracts of Phyllanthus muellerianus and Piptadeniastrum africana indicated that these two plants were not toxic. At the dose of 4 g/kg body weight, kidney and liver function tests indicated that these two medicinal plants induced no adverse effect on these organs. CONCLUSION: These results showed that, all these plant's extracts can be used as antimicrobial phytomedicines which can be therapeutically used against infections caused by multiresistant agents.

TI  - Preparation and antibacterial evaluation of decarboxylated fluoroquinolones.
AB  - Decarboxylated ciprofloxacin (3) has been reported in the literature to have antibacterial activities against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens and especially potent activity against Escherichia coli. Herein, we report our syntheses of 3 and five additional decarboxylated fluoroquinolones (FQs). We have re-evaluated the antibacterial activity of these FQs. In contrast to previously reported data, none of these decarboxylated fluoroquinolones showed significant antibacterial activity in our assays using both the broth dilution and agar methods. Our study confirmed that the presence of a carboxylic acid group at the 3-position of the fluoroquinolone scaffold is essential for antibacterial activity.
TI  - Chemical and antidiarrheal studies of Plinia cauliflora.
AB  - Plinia cauliflora (Mart.) Kausel, widespread in South America, has edible fruits, and its bark is commonly used against diarrhea and other disorders, on account of its astringency. Because diarrhea is still one of the most important causes of illness and death among children in developing countries, where the population turns to traditional medicine for its treatment, the present study determined the composition of fruit and leaf extracts of P. cauliflora, analyzed the activity against diarrhea by antimicrobial and gastrointestinal motility, and evaluated the cytotoxicity of the extracts. Chemical composition was determined by high-performance liquid chromatograpy-ultraviolet/photodiode array detection. Antimicrobial activity was analyzed by agar diffusion and the microdilution method against etiological agents of diarrhea. The effect on gastrointestinal motility was analyzed using an experimental model in mice. Cytotoxicity was evaluated in vitro with the fibroblast cell line SIRC CCL 60, and leaf extract showed a 50% inhibitory concentration of 0.48 mug/mL. Gallic acid, ellagic acid, and flavonoid derivatives were detected in the extracts. It was observed that fruit and leaf extracts showed some activity against Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Salmonella sp., and Shigella sp. However, neither extract had any effect on gastrointestinal motility.
TI  - Method for the direct observation and quantification of survival of bacteria attached to negatively or positively charged surfaces in an aqueous medium.
AB  - The risk of groundwater contamination by microbial pathogens is linked to their survival in the subsurface. Although there is a large body of literature on the inactivation behavior of suspended (planktonic) microorganisms, little is known about the inactivation of bacteria when attached to sand grain surfaces in groundwater aquifers. The main goal of this study was to develop a fluorescence-based experimental technique for evaluating the extent of inactivation over time of bacteria adhered onto a surface in an aqueous environment. Key features of the developed technique are as follows: (i) attached cells do not need to be removed from the surface of interest for quantification, (ii) bacterial inactivation can be examined in real-time for prolonged time periods, and (iii) the system remains undisturbed (i.e., the aqueous environment is unchanged) during the assay. A negatively or positively charged substrate (i.e., bare or coated glass slide) was mounted in a parallel-plate flow cell, bacteria were allowed to attach onto the substrate, and the loss of bacterial membrane integrity and respiratory activity were investigated as a function of time by fluorescence microscopy using Live/Dead BacLight and BacLight RedoxSensor CTC (5-cyano-2,3-ditolyl tetrazolium chloride) viability assays. These two different measures of bacterial inactivation result in comparable trends in bacterial inactivation, confirming the validity of the experimental technique. The results of this work show that the developed technique is sensitive enough to distinguish between the inactivation kinetics of different representative bacteria attached to either a negatively charged (bare glass) surface or a positively charged (coated glass) surface. Hence, the technique can be used to characterize bacterial inactivation kinetics when attached to environmentally relevant surfaces over a broad range of groundwater chemistries.
TI  - Synthesis, antimicrobial activity and possible mechanism of action of 9-bromo-substituted indolizinoquinoline-5,12-dione derivatives.
AB  - A series of 9-bromo-substituted indolizinoquinoline-5,12-dione derivatives was synthesized. Antimicrobial activity assessment indicates that compounds 1, 26, 27 and 28 exhibit strong activity against gram-positive bacterial strains, including Beta-hemolytic streptococcus CMCC32210, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC25923, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC12228, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC29212 and methicillin-resistant S. aureus ATCC43300 (MRSA). Compound 27 shows the best anti-MRSA activity with an MIC value of 0.031 mug/ml. To assess the mechanism of action, the inhibitory activities of compound 1 against DNA gyrase and DNA topoisomerase IV were also measured. The results indicate that compound 1 has strong inhibitory effects on the Escherichia coli DNA gyrase supercoiling activity and S. aureus Topo IV relaxing activity.
TI  - Enterococcus faecalis SufU scaffold protein enhances SufS desulfurase activity by acquiring sulfur from its cysteine-153.
AB  - Iron-sulfur [Fe-S] clusters are inorganic prosthetic groups that play essential roles in all living organisms. In vivo [Fe-S] cluster biogenesis requires enzymes involved in iron and sulfur mobilization, assembly of clusters, and delivery to their final acceptor. In these systems, a cysteine desulfurase is responsible for the release of sulfide ions, which are incorporated into a scaffold protein for subsequent [Fe-S] cluster assembly. Although three machineries have been shown to be present in Proteobacteria for [Fe-S] cluster biogenesis (NIF, ISC, and SUF), only the SUF machinery has been found in Firmicutes. We have recently described the structural similarities and differences between Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli SufU proteins, which prompted the proposal that SufU is the scaffold protein of the E. faecalis sufCDSUB system. The present work aims at elucidating the biological roles of E. faecalis SufS and SufU proteins in [Fe-S] cluster assembly. We show that SufS has cysteine desulfurase activity and cysteine-365 plays an essential role in catalysis. SufS requires SufU as activator to [4Fe-4S] cluster assembly, as its ortholog, IscU, in which the conserved cysteine-153 acts as a proximal sulfur acceptor for transpersulfurization reaction.
TI  - Chemical composition and in vitro antibacterial activity of the essential oil of  Phthirusa adunca from Venezuelan Andes.
AB  - In this paper, preliminary studies on the chemical characterization of Phthirusa  adunca Meyer essential oil, obtained by hydrodistillation, is presented. The separation of the components was performed by GC-MS. Twenty-three compounds (94.5% of the sample) were identified of which the three major ones (76% of the sample) were beta-phellandrene (38.1%), germacrene D (26.8%) and beta-pinene (11.5%). The essential oil showed a broad spectrum of activity against Salmonella Typhi CDC 57 (100 microg/mL), Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 (200 microg/mL), Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212 (250 microg/mL), Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 y Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 23357 (500 microg/mL). This is the first report on the composition and activity of the essential oil of this species.
TI  - Chemical composition and antibacterial activity of the essential oil of Lantana camara var. moritziana.
AB  - The essential oil obtained from the leaves of Lantana camara var. moritziana (Otto & Dietr.) Lopez-Palacios collected at Rubio, Tachira State, Venezuela, was obtained by hydrodistillation in a Clevenger trap (0.1% yield). The oil was analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) on HP GC-MS System, model 5973, identifying 33 compounds (97.1%) of which the major components were germacrene D (31.0%), followed by beta-caryophyllene (14.8%), a-phellandrene (6.7%), limonene (5.7%) and 1,8-cineole (5.2%). Evaluation of the antibacterial activity by agar diffusion method with discs against international reference bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella Typhi, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) showed growing inhibition of E. faecalis and S. aureus at MIC of 350 mg/mL and 400 mg/mL, respectively.
TI  - Microbiology at first visit of moderate-to-severe diabetic foot infection with antimicrobial activity and a survey of quinolone monotherapy.
AB  - Samples from 1295 patients with diabetic foot infection were evaluated; 4332 samples were collected with an average of 3.3 samples per patient. Fifty-seven percent of patients had a 2B ulcer and 23% had a 3B ulcer according to Texas University Classification. In 64.2% of samples collected at first visit an etiologic agent was identified. About 40% of the positive samples were polymicrobial. Gram positive bacteria were more frequently isolated (52.6%), Staphylococcus aureus was the most frequently isolated single agent (29.9%) and MRSA was 22% of S. aureus. Enterococcus spp., mainly Enterococcus faecalis, were 9.9%, all vancomycin susceptible except 2 isolates. Streptococci were 4.6%, more than 60% Streptococcus agalactiae. Gram negative rods were 40.6%, with enterobacteria 23.5% and Pseudomonas aeruginosa 10.3%. Anaerobes were only 0.3%, probably due to culture methods applied in our laboratory. Cotrimoxazole, rifampin and doxycycline were still active against S. aureus. ESBL producers, among enterobacteria, were 10%, mainly Escherichia coli and Proteus spp. Only colistin had a rate of susceptibility against P. aeruginosa above 90%. Levofloxacin had the best clinical activity with respect to the other quinolones, but when it failed, selected more resistant strains with respect to moxifloxacin among S. aureus and with respect to ciprofloxacin among P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Investigation of the antimicrobial activity of Rhaponticum (Rhaponticum carthamoides D.C. Iljin) and shrubby cinquefoil (Potentilla fruticosa L.).
AB  - The aim of the study was to determine antimicrobial activity of rhaponticum and shrubby cinquefoil extracts. MATERIAL AND METHODS. Ethanol extract from the leaves of rhaponticum (Rhaponticum carthamoides D.C. Iljin) and shrubby cinquefoil (Potentilla fruticosa L.) was produced at the Department of Food Technology, Kaunas University of Technology. The antimicrobial activity of the viscous extract or rhaponticum and shrubby cinquefoil was evaluated using standard microorganism cultures (bacteria Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 33499, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Proteus mirabilis ATCC 12459, Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633, Bacillus cereus ATCC 8035 and fungi Candida albicans ATCC 60193). The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the examined preparations was determined. RESULTS. Both studied preparations - rhaponticum (Rhaponticum carthamoides D.C. Iljin) and shrubby cinquefoil (Potentilla fruticosa L.) - demonstrated similar antimicrobial activity. The highest sensitivity to the studied preparations was observed in microbes with eukaryotic cell structure: Candida albicans, which is a fungus, and a spore-forming prokaryotic bacterium, Bacillus cereus. The highest resistance was observed in Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. CONCLUSIONS. The studied preparations - viscous extracts of rhaponticum and shrubby cinquefoil - are substances with antimicrobial activity against gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis) and gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus mirabilis) bacteria, spore-forming bacteria (Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus cereus), and fungi (Candida albicans).
TI  - Synergistic and antagonistic effect of lactic acid bacteria on tyramine production by food-borne pathogenic bacteria in tyrosine decarboxylase broth.
AB  - The effect of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains on tyramine (TYR) and also other biogenic amines (BA) production by eight common food-borne pathogen (FBP) in tyrosine decarboxylase broth (TDB) was investigated by using a rapid HPLC method. Significant differences were observed among the FBP strains in ammonia (AMN) and BA production apart from tryptamine, histamine (HIS) and spermine formation (p<0.05). Salmonella paratyphi A was characterised as the main amine producer. LAB had an important synergetic role in some BA production by food-borne pathogenic bacteria, although the effect of some LAB strains on BA production was strain-dependent. Lactococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp. resulted in significantly higher TYR accumulation by Aeromonas hydrophila and Enterococcus faecalis in TDB. The presence of Lactococcus and/or Lactobacillus in TDB significantly increased HIS production by A. hydrophila, Escherichia coli, Ent. faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, whereas HIS accumulation was significantly reduced by Staphylococcus aureus, S. paratyphi A and Listeria monocytogenes.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial effect of aqueous and ethanolic Moringa leaf extracts.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the antibacterial effect of aqueous and ethanolic moringa  leaf extracts (Moringa oleifera) on the growth of gram-positive and negative bacteria. METHODS: Paper disks were soaked with 100, 200, 300 and 400 muL of extract at 20 g/180 mL and 10 g/190 mL. All extracts were tested against Escherichia coli (ATCC25922), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC25923), Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC29212), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC27853), Salmonella enteritidis (IH) and Aeromonas caviae. The susceptibility tests were performed using the modified disk diffusion method. RESULTS: The strains E. coli, P. aeruginosa and S. enteritidis (IH) were resistant to all treatments. In general, disks with 400 muL extract were the most efficient against S. aureus, V. parahaemolyticus, E. faecalis and A. caviae. CONCLUSIONS: The study indicates a promising potential for aqueous and ethanolic Moringa leaf extracts as alternative treatment of infections caused by the tested strains.
TI  - Potential role of fosfomycin in the treatment of community-acquired lower urinary tract infections caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli.
AB  - Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli (ESBLEC) are emerging pathogens causing urinary tract infections (UTIs) in community patients worldwide. Treatment for community-acquired ESBLEC UTIs, especially in the outpatient setting, may be problematic because many of the strains are resistant to the traditional oral therapies. Fosfomycin is an oral agent that is approved for the treatment of uncomplicated UTIs caused by Enterococcus faecalis and E. coli. Data evaluating the clinical efficacy of fosfomycin for the treatment of community-acquired ESBLEC lower UTIs are limited. Three studies evaluating fosfomycin in the treatment of ESBLEC lower UTIs have been conducted. Clinical success was documented in >78% of patients. From the available data, it seems that fosfomycin may be an effective and reasonable treatment option for outpatient management of community-acquired ESBLEC UTIs, excluding pyelonephritis. Fosfomycin is a very attractive agent because it is available orally, has limited drug interactions, has a favorable adverse event profile, and would be very cost effective considering the potential complications of inadequate treatment and the high cost associated with parenteral therapies. Limitations to the clinical use of fosfomycin may include optimal dose and duration not being established, fosfomycin not often being included on culture and sensitivity reports and emerging resistance.
TI  - Net energy production associated with pathogen inactivation during mesophilic and thermophilic anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge.
AB  - The potential for anaerobic digester energy production must be balanced with the  sustainability of reusing the resultant biosolids for land application. Mesophilic, thermophilic, temperature-phased, and high temperature (60 or 70 degrees C) batch pre-treatment digester configurations have been systematically evaluated for net energy production and pathogen inactivation potential. Energy input requirements and net energy production were modeled for each digester scheme. First-order inactivation rate coefficients for Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis and bacteriophage MS-2 were measured at each digester temperature and full-scale pathogen inactivation performance was estimated for each indicator organism and each digester configuration. Inactivation rates were found to increase dramatically at temperatures above 55 degrees C. Modeling full-scale performance using retention times based on U.S. EPA time and temperature constraints predicts a 1-2 log inactivation in mesophilic treatment, and a 2-5 log inactivation in 50-55 degrees C thermophilic and temperature-phased treatments. Incorporating a 60 or 70 degrees C batch pre-treatment phase resulted in dramatically higher potency, achieving MS-2 inactivation of 14 and 16 logs respectively, and complete inactivation (over 100 log reduction) of E. coli and E. faecalis. For temperatures less than 70 degrees C, viability staining of thermally-treated E. coli showed significantly reduced inactivation relative to standard culture enumeration. Due to shorter residence times in thermophilic reactors, the net energy production for all digesters was similar (less than 20% difference) with the 60 or 70 degrees C batch treatment configurations producing the most net energy and the mesophilic treatment producing the least. Incorporating a 60 or 70 degrees C pre-treatment phase can dramatically increase pathogen inactivation performance without decreasing net energy capture from anaerobic digestion. Energy consumption is not a significant barrier against improving the pathogen quality of biosolids.
TI  - Selective immobilization of Acinetobacter junii on the natural zeolitized tuff in municipal wastewater.
AB  - The immobilization of desired bacteria onto material was usually performed in synthetic media. The aim of this study was to test the immobilization of phosphate (P)-accumulating bacteria Acinetobacter junii onto natural zeolitized tuff (NZ) in the raw or sterilized municipal wastewater containing the common bacteria Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis and the performance of immobilized A. junii in the same type of wastewater. In the sterilized wastewater which contained the mixture of A. junii, E. coli and E. faecalis, the A. junii was selectively immobilized onto NZ in significantly higher numbers than E. coli and E. faecalis. The A. junii added in the form of bioparticles to the wastewater containing E. coli and E. faecalis, multiplied and removed P from wastewater. The P removal from wastewater was a function of biomass of P-accumulating bacteria and not the amount of NZ or bioparticles used. The performance of A. junii was significantly better in membrane filtered than in autoclaved wastewater. The experiments that were performed in raw non sterilized wastewater showed that A. junii can be successfully immobilized onto NZ in competition with natively present heterotrophic bacteria, retain its metabolic activity and successfully remove P from such water, which makes this technology feasible from biotechnological aspect.
TI  - Characterization of the deoxynucleotide triphosphate triphosphohydrolase (dNTPase) activity of the EF1143 protein from Enterococcus faecalis and crystal structure of the activator-substrate complex.
AB  - The EF1143 protein from Enterococcus faecalis is a distant homolog of deoxynucleotide triphosphate triphosphohydrolases (dNTPases) from Escherichia coli and Thermus thermophilus. These dNTPases are important components in the regulation of the dNTP pool in bacteria. Biochemical assays of the EF1143 dNTPase activity demonstrated nonspecific hydrolysis of all canonical dNTPs in the presence of Mn(2+). In contrast, with Mg(2+) hydrolysis required the presence of dGTP as an effector, activating the degradation of dATP and dCTP with dGTP also being consumed in the reaction with dATP. The crystal structure of EF1143 and dynamic light scattering measurements in solution revealed a tetrameric oligomer as the most probable biologically active unit. The tetramer contains four dGTP specific allosteric regulatory sites and four active sites. Examination of the active site with the dATP substrate suggests an in-line nucleophilic attack on the alpha-phosphate center as a possible mechanism of the hydrolysis and two highly conserved residues, His-129 and Glu-122, as an acid-base catalytic dyad. Structural differences between EF1143 apo and holo forms revealed mobility of the alpha3 helix that can regulate the size of the active site binding pocket and could be stabilized in the open conformation upon formation of the tetramer and dGTP effector binding.
TI  - Evaluation of forty new phenothiazine derivatives for activity against intrinsic  efflux pump systems of reference Escherichia coli, Salmonella Enteritidis, Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus strains.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Because phenothiazines inhibit efflux pumps of bacteria, forty new phenothiazine derivatives were tested for their inhibition of the efflux pump systems of Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Detection of efflux pump activity was conducted by a previously described automated fluorimetric method. RESULTS: Although many of the compounds significantly inhibited efflux by distinct bacteria, four compounds had exceptional activity against the efflux pump systems of the pathogenic wild type bacteria Escherichia coli, Salmonella Enteritidis, Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus. These four compounds were then evaluated for ability to reduce or reverse resistance of multi-drug resistant members of Escherichia coli, Salmonella and Staphylococcus aureus whose MDR phenotypes are mediated by specific over-expressed efflux pumps. One of the compounds, 2173, significantly reduced resistance of MDR Staphylococcus aureus. CONCLUSION: These results suggest possible use of compound 2173 for therapy of infections caused by this organism.
TI  - Antioxidant, electrochemical, thermal, antimicrobial and alkane oxidation properties of tridentate Schiff base ligands and their metal complexes.
AB  - In this study, two Schiff base ligands (HL(1) and HL(2)) and their Cu(II), Co(II), Ni(II), Pd(II) and Ru(III) metal complexes were synthesized and characterized by the analytical and spectroscopic methods. Alkane oxidation activities of the metal complexes were studied on cyclohexane as substrate. The ligands and their metal complexes were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity against Corynebacterium xerosis, Bacillus brevis, Bacillus megaterium, Bacillus cereus, Mycobacterium smegmatis, Staphylococcus aureus, Micrococcus luteus and Enterococcus faecalis (as gram-positive bacteria) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Yersinia enterocolitica, Klebsiella fragilis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Candida albicans (as gram-negative bacteria). The antioxidant properties of the Schiff base ligands were evaluated in a series of in vitro tests: 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical scavenging and reducing power activity of superoxide anion radical generated non-enzymatic systems. Electrochemical and thermal properties of the compounds were investigated.
TI  - Detection of volatile compounds produced by microbial growth in urine by selected ion flow tube mass spectrometry (SIFT-MS).
AB  - Selected ion flow tube-mass spectrometry has been used to measure the volatile compounds occurring in the headspace of urine samples inoculated with common urinary tract infection (UTI)-causing microbes Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, or Candida albicans. This technique has the potential to offer rapid and simple diagnosis of the causative agent of UTIs.
TI  - Validation of the Zurich burn-biofilm model.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite advances in the use of topical and parenteral antimicrobial therapy and the practice of early tangential burn-wound excision, bacterial infection remains a major problem in the management of burn victims today. The purpose of this study was to design and evaluate a polyspecies biofilm model with bacteria known to cause severe infections in burn patients. The model is simple to prepare, maintain and analyse, and allows for short-term exposure to antimicrobials. RESULTS: Initial experiments showed that it was impossible to establish balanced polyspecies biofilms with an inoculum of Gram-positive and -negative bacteria. After 64.5 h of incubation, the Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) had suppressed the Gram-positives (Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus intermedius). However, adding the Gram-negative bacteria after 41.5 h to an established biofilm of Gram-positives resulted in a balanced microbial consortium. After 64.5 h, all species were present in high numbers (10(7) to 10(8) colony forming units (CFU) per biofilm). Multiple repetitions showed high reproducibility of biofilm formation without significant differences between and within experiments. Combined fluorescence in situ hybridisation/confocal laser scanning microscopy (FISH/CLSM) analyses, for which biofilms had to be grown on a different non-flexible substrate (hydroxy apatite), revealed that, by 41.5 h, the biofilm consisted of an almost confluent layer of bacteria firmly adherent to the substratum. After 64.5 h (22 h after the addition of the Gram negatives), the biofilm consisted of a confluent mixture of single cells, an abundance of galaxies of bacteria with small lacunae and large amounts of extracellular matrix polysaccharides. CONCLUSIONS: The polyspecies biofilm model contains the most prevalent burn-associated Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial pathogens and mimics the Gram-negative shift observed in vivo. It shows excellent reproducibility. It should allow adaptation to the bacterial spectrum prevalent in different burn centres and lead to a much more reliable investigation of the efficiency of topical antimicrobial agents than models operating with planktonic bacteria. The experiments further open up the perspective to create an in vivo model using these biofilms as infectious agents.
TI  - Antagonistic effect of Lactobacillus strains against gas-producing coliforms isolated from colicky infants.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Infantile colic is a common disturb within the first 3 months of life, nevertheless the pathogenesis is incompletely understood and treatment remains an open issue. Intestinal gas production is thought to be one of the causes of abdominal discomfort in infants suffering from colic. However, data about the role of the amount of gas produced by infants' colonic microbiota and the correlation with the onset of colic symptoms are scanty. The benefit of supplementation with lactobacilli been recently reported but the mechanisms by which they exert their effects have not yet been fully defined. This study was performed to evaluate the interaction between Lactobacillus spp. strains and gas-forming coliforms isolated from stools of colicky infants. RESULTS: Strains of coliforms were isolated from stools of 45 colicky and 42 control breastfed infants in McConkey Agar and identified using PCR with species-specific primers, and the BBL Enterotube II system for Enterobacteriaceae. Gas-forming capability of coliforms was assessed in liquid cultures containing lactose as sole carbon source. The average count of total coliforms in colicky infants was significantly higher than controls: 5.98 (2.00-8.76) log10 vs 3.90 (2.50-7.10) CFU/g of faeces (p = 0.015). The following strains were identified: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae and Enterococcus faecalis. Then, 27 Lactobacillus strains were tested for their antagonistic effect against coliforms both by halo-forming method and in liquid co-cultures. Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii DSM 20074 and L. plantarum MB 456 were able to inhibit all coliforms strains (halo-forming method), also in liquid co-cultures, thus demonstrating an antagonistic activity. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that two out of 27 strains of Lactobacillus examined possess an antimicrobial effect against six species of gas-forming coliforms isolated from colicky infants. Our findings may stimulate new researches to identify which Lactobacillus strains can improve colicky symptoms by acting on coliforms gut colonization.
TI  - Epidemiological features and resistance pattern in uropathogens isolated from chronic bacterial prostatitis.
AB  - Chronic bacterial prostatitis (CBP) is, usually, caused by uropathogens, especially gram-negative bacilli, although infection is sometimes due to Gram-positive and atypical microorganisms. A recent increasing in prevalence of Gram-positive strains has been reported. The aim of this study was to explore the epidemiological features and resistance rates in uropathogens isolated from CBP outpatients in last 10 years. All consecutive outpatients with demonstrated CBP attending a single Sexually Transmitted Disease centre from January 1997 and December 2008, were enrolled and underwent microbiological cultures in first void early morning urine, midstream urine, expressed prostatic secretion, and post prostate massage urine. Prevalence of different bacterial strains was stratified in four different periods: 1997-1999, 2000-2002, 2003-2005, 2006-2008. Any changes observed in epidemiological features and resistance rates in uropathogens over the whole study period have been analyzed. The present study has been planned, thus, as in vitro study. From 6,221 patients, 4,601 Gram-positive and 1,620 Gram-negative bacterial strains have been isolated. Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli strains are the first and second frequent pathogens found, respectively. Significant differences between E. faecalis prevalence in the 1997-1999 and 2006-2008 periods were found. E. coli showed a significant difference between prevalence in 1997-1999 and 2006-2008 periods. Gram-positive organisms showed a decreasing of susceptibility to ciprofloxacin as well as Gram-negative strains, while a good susceptibility to the levofloxacin was evidenced. E. faecalis prevalence seemed to be raised in 2006-2008 periods. Moreover, a decreasing of activity of ciprofloxacin and a good activity profile of levofloxacin have been reported.
TI  - [Clinical and microbiological profiles of anti-personnel mine injuries in the Medellin area of northwestern Colombia].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The counts of antipersonnel mine injuries are increasing worldwide, but in Colombia, documentation of the clinical and microbiological characteristics of these lesions is lacking. OBJECTIVES: To determine the clinical and microbiological characteristics of antipersonnel mine injuries for patients admitted for treatment during a 2 and a half year period. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The medical records were reviewed for 151 patients hospitalized with injuries caused by antipersonnel mines. The admissions occurred between January 1st 2003 and July 31st 2005 at a highly specialized university hospital, the Pablo Tobon Uribe Hospital in Medellin, Colombia. RESULTS: All patients were male, mean age 24 years old, and all but 8 of them military. The length of stay averaged 20 days and hospital mortality 4%. Multiple lesions occurred in 66.8% of the cases, 88.0% of the injuries affected the limbs, and amputations were mandated in 52.3% of patients. A total of 313 specimens were cultured--68.7% of cultures were positive, and 386 microorganisms were identified. The most prevalent bacteria in the first culture were Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli. In subsequent cultures, P. aeruginosa and Enterococcus faecalis appeared. Most of the patients (93.4%) received standard antibiotic therapy, ampicillin/sulbactam. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical and microbiological characteristics of patients were related to their military occupation and the complex injuries produced by the mines. Knowledge of these characteristics will permit the design of better management strategies and empirical treatments.
TI  - Identification of the binding modes of N-phenylphthalimides inhibiting bacterial  thymidylate synthase through X-ray crystallography screening.
AB  - To identify specific bacterial thymidylate synthase (TS) inhibitors, we exploited phenolphthalein (PTH), which inhibits both bacterial and human enzymes. The X-ray crystal structure of Lactobacillus casei TS (LcTS) that binds PTH showed multiple binding modes of the inhibitor, which prevented a classical structure-based drug design approach. To overcome this issue, we synthesized two phthalimidic libraries that were tested against TS enzymes and then we performed X-ray crystallographic screening of the active compounds. Compounds 6A, 8A, and 12A showed 40-fold higher affinity for bacterial TS than human TS. The X-ray crystallographic screening characterized the binding mode of six inhibitors in complexes with LcTS. Of these, 20A, 23A, and 24A showed a common unique binding mode, whereas 8A showed a different, unique binding mode. A comparative analysis of the LcTS X-ray complexes that were obtained with the pathogenic TS enabled the selection of compounds 8A and 23A as specific compounds and starting points to be exploited for the specific inhibition of pathogen enzymes.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibilities of commonly encountered bacterial isolates to fosfomycin determined by agar dilution and disk diffusion methods.
AB  - We studied the antimicrobial activity of fosfomycin against 960 strains of commonly encountered bacteria associated with urinary tract infection using standard agar dilution and disk diffusion methods. Species studied included 3 common species of Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia; methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus; and vancomycin-susceptible and resistant Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium. MICs and inhibition zone diameters were interpreted in accordance with both the currently recommended Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) criteria for urinary tract isolates of Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis and the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) criteria for Enterobacteriaceae. Tentative zone diameter interpretive criteria were developed for species not currently published by CLSI or EUCAST. Escherichia coli was uniformly susceptible to fosfomycin, as were most strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae. A. baumannii was resistant to fosfomycin, while the prevalence of resistance in P. aeruginosa and S. maltophilia was greatly affected by the choice of MIC breakpoint. New tentative zone diameter criteria for K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, S. aureus, and E. faecium were able to be set, providing some interim laboratory guidance for disk diffusion until further breakpoint evaluations are undertaken by CLSI and EUCAST.
TI  - Neutral metallated and meso-substituted porphyrins as antimicrobial agents against gram-positive pathogens.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus is a bacterial pathogen that causes severe infections among humans. The increasing emergence of antibiotic resistance necessitates the development of new strategies to combat the spread of disease. One approach is photodynamic inactivation using porphyrin photosensitizers, which generate superoxide and other radicals in the presence of light, causing cell death via the oxidation of proteins and lipids. In this study, we analyzed a novel library of meso-substituted and metallated porphyrins for activity against multidrug-resistant S. aureus. From a library of 251 compounds, 51 showed antimicrobial activity, in three discrete classes of activity: those that functioned only in light, those that had toxicity only in darkness, and those that displayed activity regardless of illumination. We further demonstrated the broad-spectrum activity of these compounds against a variety of pathogens, including Bacillus anthracis, Enterococcus faecalis, and Escherichia coli. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) analyses of lead compounds (XPZ-263 and XPZ-271) revealed strong activity and killing towards methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains. An analysis of mutation frequencies revealed low incidences of resistance to lead compounds by E. coli and MRSA. Finally, an exploration of the underlying mechanism of action suggests that these compounds do not depend solely upon light-induced radical generation for toxicity, highlighting their potential for clinical applications.
TI  - Determination of disk diffusion and MIC quality control guidelines for JNJ-Q2, a  novel quinolone.
AB  - JNJ-Q2 is a novel fluorinated 4-quinolone in development for treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infection and community-acquired bacterial pneumonia. This quality control (QC) study was performed to establish ranges for control strains: Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213 (0.004 to 0.015 mug/ml), Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212 (0.015 to 0.06 mug/ml), Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 (0.5 to 2 mug/ml and 17 to 23 mm), Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 (0.008 to 0.03 mug/ml and 30 to 36 mm), Haemophilus influenzae ATCC 49247 (0.002 to 0.015 mug/ml and 31 to 39 mm), Streptococcus pneumoniae ATCC 49619 (0.004 to 0.015 mug/ml and 28 to 35 mm), and S. aureus ATCC 25923 (32 to 38 mm). These ranges will be crucial in evaluating JNJ-Q2 potency as it progresses through clinical trial development.
TI  - In vitro assay of the antimicrobial activity of kephir against bacterial and fungal strains.
AB  - Kephir is a fermented carbonated refreshing milk, with a slightly acidic aromatic taste and creamy foam composition which contains lactobacilli, leuconostocci, acetic acid bacteria, lactostreptococci and yeasts. Recent studies have demonstrated its antibacterial, immunostimulating, antitumoral and cholesterol-lowering activities. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the antimicrobial activity of kephir against Bacillus subtilis spp. spizizenii ATCC 6633, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Escherichia coli ATCC 8739, Salmonella enteritidis ATCC 13076, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 9027 and Candida albicans ATCC 10231. The kephir fermented for 24 h and 48 h, as well and after 7 days preservation at 4-8 degrees C was tested by in vitro disk diffusion method. The intensity of the antimicrobial activity was interpreted by comparison with two antibiotics, i.e. ampicillin and neomycin. RESULTS: The antimicrobial activity of 24 h as well as 48 fermented kephir, fresh or after 7 days preservation at 4-8 degrees C was similar and observed against B. subtilis, S. aureus, E. coli, E. faecalis and S. enteritidis. For E. coli, E. faecalis and S. enteritidis the antimicrobial activity was superior to both tested antibiotics and for B. subtilis and S. aureus to one antibiotic. The tested products exhibited no activity against P. aeruginosa and C. albicans. CONCLUSION: Kephir is exhibiting large spectrum and strong antibacterial activity probably due to the complex viable probiotic strains association producing antimicrobial substances.
TI  - Airway pathogens during the first year after lung transplantation: a single-center experience.
AB  - After lung transplantation, a high level of immunosuppression is needed to prevent rejection. This demand renders recipients more sensitive to infections. As pulmonary infections are a major clinical problem during the first postoperative year after lung transplantation, preventive treatment and regular surveillance examinations are needed for immediate, adequate therapy. We describe the airway pathogens registered during the first posttransplantation year among our 12 lung transplant recipients since December 2008. Samples were obtained for microbiologic analysis from the upper and lower respiratory tracts and from serum as part of routine care. During the first year after transplantation the most frequent pathogens were fungi (Candida albicans 82%; Aspergillus 50%), Pneumocystis (8%), gram-negative bacteria (Pseudomonas spp 60%; Klebsiella 25%, Acinetobacter 17%; Escherichia Coli 17%; and Enterococcus faecalis 25%), and Staphylococcus aureus (50%, including methicillin-resistant strains 25%). This pathogen spectrum in the first postoperative year after lung transplantation was similar to other centers. Colonization with Pseudomonas or fungi presented early and was prevalent among our patients.
TI  - Essential oil composition and antibacteral activity of Vismia baccifera fruits collected from Merida, Venezuela.
AB  - The essential oil from the fruits of Vismia baccifera Triana & Planch. (Gutttiferae), collected in June 2009, was analyzed by GC/MS. A yield of 0.6% oil was obtained by hydrodistillation. Twenty-seven components were identified by comparison of their mass spectra with those in the Wiley GC-MS Library data base. The major components were trans-cadin-l1,4-diene (36.6%), cis-cadin-1,4-diene (18.8%) and beta-caryophyllene (11.9%). The essential oil showed a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity against the important human pathogenic Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923), Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29212), Escherichia coli (ATCC 25992), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (ATCC 23357) with MIC values ranging from 9 to 37 microg/mL.
TI  - Recognition of pathogenic microbes by the Drosophila phagocytic pattern recognition receptor Eater.
AB  - Non-opsonic phagocytosis is a primordial form of pathogen recognition that is mediated by the direct interaction of phagocytic receptors with microbial surfaces. In the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, the EGF-like repeat containing scavenger receptor Eater is expressed by phagocytes and is required to survive infections with gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. However, the mechanisms by which this receptor recognizes different types of bacteria are poorly understood. To address this problem, we generated a soluble, Fc-tagged receptor variant of Eater comprising the N-terminal 199 amino acids including four EGF-like repeats. We first established that Eater-Fc displayed specific binding to broad yet distinct classes of heat- or ethanol-inactivated microbes and behaved similarly to the membrane-bound, full-length Eater receptor. We then used Eater-Fc as a tool to probe Eater binding to the surface of live bacteria. Eater-Fc bound equally well to naive or inactivated Staphylococcus aureus or Enterococcus faecalis, suggesting that in vivo, Eater directly targets live gram-positive bacteria, enabling their phagocytic clearance and destruction. By contrast, Eater-Fc was unable to interact with live, naive gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). For these bacteria, Eater-Fc binding required membrane-disrupting treatments. Furthermore, we found that cecropin A, a cationic, membrane-disrupting antimicrobial peptide, could promote Eater-Fc binding to live E. coli, even at sublethal concentrations. These results suggest a previously unrecognized mechanism by which antimicrobial peptides cooperate with phagocytic receptors to extend the range of microbes that can be targeted by a single, germline-encoded receptor.
TI  - Screening of Australian plants for antimicrobial activity against Campylobacter jejuni.
AB  - Campylobacter jejuni is the most common cause of acute enteritis in humans, with  symptoms such as diarrhoea, fever and abdominal cramps. In this study, 115 extracts from 109 Australian plant species were investigated for their antimicrobial activities against two C. jejuni strains using an in vitro broth microdilution assay. Among the plants tested, 107 (93%) extracts showed activity at a concentration between 32 and 1024 microg/mL against at least one C. jejuni strain. Seventeen plant extracts were selected for further testing against another six C. jejuni strains, as well as Campylobacter coli, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Bacillus cereus, Proteus mirabilis and Enterococcus faecalis. The extract from Eucalyptus occidentalis demonstrated the highest antimicrobial activity, with an inhibitory concentration of 32 microg/mL against C. jejuni and B. cereus. This study has shown that extracts of selected Australian plants possess antimicrobial activity against C. jejuni and thus may have application in the control of this organism in live poultry and retail poultry products.
TI  - Impact of medicated feed on the development of antimicrobial resistance in bacteria at integrated pig-fish farms in Vietnam.
AB  - Integrated livestock-fish aquaculture utilizes animal excreta, urine, and feed leftovers as pond fertilizers to enhance the growth of plankton and other microorganisms eaten by the fish. However, antimicrobial-resistant bacteria may be transferred and develop in the pond due to selective pressure from antimicrobials present in animal feed, urine, and feces. In an experimental pig-fish farm located in periurban Hanoi, Vietnam, nine piglets were provided feed containing 5 mug of tetracycline (TET)/kg pig weight/day and 0.45 mug of enrofloxacin (ENR)/kg pig weight/day during the second and fourth (last) months of the experiment. The aim of this study was to determine the association between the provision of pig feed with antimicrobials and the development of antimicrobial resistance, as measured in a total of 520 Escherichia coli and 634 Enterococcus strains isolated from pig manure and water-sediment pond samples. MIC values for nalidixic acid (NAL) and ENR showed that E. coli and Enterococcus spp. overall exhibited significant higher frequencies of resistance toward NAL and ENR during the 2 months when pigs were administered feed with antimicrobials, with frequencies reaching 60 to 80% in both water-sediment and manure samples. TET resistance for both indicators was high (>80%) throughout the study period, which indicates that TET-resistant E. coli and Enterococcus spp. were present in the piglets before the initiation of the experiment. PCR-based identification showed similar relative occurrences of Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, and other Enterococcus spp. in the water-sediment and manure samples, suggesting that Enterococcus spp. isolated in the ponds originated mainly from the pig manure. The development of antimicrobial resistance in integrated animal husbandry-fish farms and possible transfers and the impact of such resistance on food safety and human health should be further assessed.
TI  - Pharmacokinetics of free ertapenem in critically ill septic patients: intermittent versus continuous infusion.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this paper was to compare the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) parameters of continuous (CI) and intermittent infusion (ITI) of ertapenem into critically ill patients with severe abdominal infections. METHODS: Twenty septic patients hospitalized in a university hospital intensive care unit were enrolled in the study. Half of the patients received ertapenem as an ITI 1 g bolus once daily, and the other half of the patients received the same dose via CI over 24 h following a 1-g loading dose. Blood was drawn 1, 12 and 24 h after terminating ITI or on days 2, 3 and 5 after starting CI for each patient. After centrifugation, the drawn blood was frozen at -80 degrees C until being examined by high-performance liquid-chromatography analysis. RESULTS: Median serum-free ertapenem concentrations were as follows: fCmax = 98.9 mg/L and fCmin = 2.5 mg/L for ITI, and fCss=15.9 mg/L for CI. The ITI and CI median total clearance and volumes of distribution were 2.2 L/h vs. 2.5 L/h and 15.4 L vs. 21.0 L, respectively. The ertapenem MIC ranges were as follows: Escherichia coli (0.006 to 0.5 mg/L), Enterobacter cloacae (0.023 to 0.5 mg/L), Klebsiella oxytoca (0.023 to 0.5 mg/L), Staphylococcus aureus (0.38 to 3 mg/L), Streptococcus viridians (0.38 to 3 mg/L) and Enterococcus faecalis (0.38 to 3 mg/L). ITI and CI provided steady-state serum-free ertapenem concentrations constantly above the MIC for all bacteria. CONCLUSION: Ertapenem exhibited satisfactory PK/PD parameters and achieved serum-free concentrations 100% of the time, above even the high MIC of extracellular pathogens normally encountered during severe abdominal infections. CI administration resulted in equally effective PK/PD parameters as ITI in normal weight, good renal-function patients.
TI  - Sensitivity to disinfection of bacterial indicator organisms for monitoring the Salmonella Enteritidis status of layer farms after cleaning and disinfection.
AB  - The present study evaluated Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, and Enterococcus hirae as potential indicator organisms for the possible Salmonella Enteritidis (SE) presence in layer farms after cleaning and disinfection by comparing their susceptibility to disinfection. A quantitative suspension disinfection test according to European Standard EN1656 was performed using disinfection products CID20 and Virocid (both from CID Lines, Ieper, Belgium). In a preliminary test, the sensitivity to both disinfection products was compared between ATCC strains of SE, E. coli, En. faecalis, and En. hirae. The sensitivity of SE to disinfection was most comparable to that of E. coli. A second disinfection test compared the elimination of E. coli to SE ATCC strains as well as field strains. Results showed no significant effect regarding the strain (P > 0.05 for CID20 and Virocid), meaning that no difference was detected in sensitivity toward disinfection. When comparing the sensitivity in general at species level for all concentrations of disinfectant used, no significant difference was found between E. coli and SE in sensitivity to Virocid (P > 0.05). In conclusion, because of its similar response to disinfection in a suspension disinfection test, E. coli could be used as an indicator for possible Salmonella presence after cleaning and disinfection.
TI  - Outcome of treated and untreated asymptomatic bacteriuria in renal transplant recipients.
AB  - BACKGROUND: No guidelines exist concerning treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria  in renal transplant recipients (RTR). Because of scarce clinical symptoms and fear of complications, such episodes are frequently treated based on subjective criteria without clear clinical benefit, with the risk of selecting resistant pathogens. METHODS: We retrospectively analysed the outcome of 334 asymptomatic Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis) bacteriuria that occurred in 77 RTR later than 1 month post-transplantation. We distinguished: Type I, high-grade bacteriuria with pyuria; Type II, high-grade bacteriuria without pyuria; Type III, low-grade bacteriuria with pyuria and Type IV, low-grade bacteriuria without pyuria. RESULTS: None of the 334 episodes was followed by acute rejection or chronic pyelonephritis. One hundred and one (30%) episodes were treated [32 (62%) Type I, 38 (45%) Type II, 13 (36%) Type III and 18 (11%) Type IV]. Evolution to symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI) was similar between treated and untreated episodes (0/101 versus 4/233, P = 0.32). The four UTI resolved favourably without further complication upon treatment. Persistent asymptomatic bacteriuria occurred in 45 (46%) treated episodes (2 Type I, 27 Type II, 8 Type III and 9 Type IV), with selection of resistant pathogen in 35 cases (78%). Spontaneous bacterial clearance occurred in 138 (59%) untreated episodes (15 Type I, 23 Type II, 9 Type III and 91 Type IV). Negative control cultures tended to be more frequent in treated Type I (P = 0.09) and in untreated Type II episodes (P = 0.08). CONCLUSION: Restricting antibiotic treatments for asymptomatic low-grade bacteriuria and high-grade bacteriuria in the absence of pyuria, occurring later than 1 month posttransplantation, might be safe in RTR.
TI  - Structure-based design of a new series of D-glutamic acid based inhibitors of bacterial UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine:D-glutamate ligase (MurD).
AB  - MurD ligase is one of the key enzymes participating in the intracellular steps of peptidoglycan biosynthesis and constitutes a viable target in the search for novel antibacterial drugs to combat bacterial drug-resistance. We have designed, synthesized, and evaluated a new series of D-glutamic acid-based Escherichia coli MurD inhibitors incorporating the 5-benzylidenethiazolidin-4-one scaffold. The crystal structure of 16 in the MurD active site has provided a good starting point for the design of structurally optimized inhibitors 73-75 endowed with improved MurD inhibitory potency (IC(50) between 3 and 7 muM). Inhibitors 74 and 75 showed weak activity against Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis. Compounds 73-75, with IC(50) values in the low micromolar range, represent the most potent D-Glu-based MurD inhibitors reported to date.
TI  - Susceptibility of Gram-positive and -negative bacteria to novel nitric oxide-releasing nanoparticle technology.
AB  - The rapidly evolving crisis of antibiotic resistance among microorganisms has contributed to the rise of patient morbidity and mortality from nosocomial and community-acquired infections. Therefore, innovative antimicrobial technology targeting mechanisms to which the bacteria are unlikely to evolve resistance is urgently needed. We have previously described a nitric oxide-releasing nanoparticle (NO-np) with efficacy against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Acinetobacter baumannii in vitro and in murine wound and abscess models. Although the prior findings suggest that the NO-np can be a useful therapeutic for skin and soft tissue infections, the antimicrobial spectrum of NO-np has yet to be fully elucidated. In the current study, we investigated the efficacy of a NO-np against several Gram-positive and -negative clinical isolates. We found that the NO-np were uniformly active against all of the Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolates examined, including strains that were both sensitive and resistant to commonly used antibiotics. We concluded that the NO-np have the potential to serve as a novel broad spectrum antimicrobial agent.
TI  - [Antibiotic resistance of pathogens isolated from 181 children with complicated urinary tract infection].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the distribution and antibiotic resistance of pathogens isolated from children with complicated urinary tract infection. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed on the distribution and antibiotic resistance of pathogens isolated from 181 children with complicated urinary tract infection (positive urine culture). The antibiotic resistance of common pathogens was determined by the antimicrobial susceptibility test. RESULTS: Gram-negative bacilli were the main pathogens (63.5%), and involved Escherichia coli (E.coli) of 42.0%. Gram-positive cocci accounted for 32.1%, and involved enterococci faecalis of 15.5%. Fungi infection was found in 4.4% of children. The resistance rate of E.coli to ampicillin was the highest (89.4%), but the rate decreased significantly by adding amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (34.2%). E.coli had a high resistance rate to cephazolin, ceftriaxone and cafalotin (>50%), but the resistance rate of E.coli to cefoperazone/sulbouam was significantly lower than other cephalosporins (P<0.01). E.coli was sensitive to imipenem and displayed a lower resistance rate to furadantin (<10%). The resistance rate of enterococci faecalis to rifampicin was high (78.3%), but was low to furadantin, vancomycin and linezolid (<10%). The multiresistant strains accounted for 77.4% of gram-negative bacilli. CONCLUSIONS: E.coli is the major pathogen in children with complicated urinary tract infection, and the enterococci-caused urinary tract infection has been increasing. These pathogens have a high antibiotic resistance, and most of them are multiresistant. Antimicrobial therapy should be based on the results of urine culture and antimicrobial susceptibility test.
TI  - [Bacterial strains isolated from systemic infections and reported for evaluation  and antibiotic resistance surveillance by the "Dr. Victor Babes" Clinical Hospital for Infectious and Tropical Diseases, Bucharest].
AB  - AIM: Testing antibiotic resistance of bacterial strains (compulsor, reported for  EARSS surveillance) isolated from patients hospitalised for systemic infection in the "Dr. V. Babe" Hospital for Infectious and Tropical Diseases during 01.01.2005-11.11.2009, for a dynamic evaluation and for the surveillance of resistance emergence for certain classes of antibiotics. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Bacterial isolation: BacT/ALERT system; strain identification in classic and automated system (ATB Expression. VITEK 2C): antibioresistance: disk-difussion method (NCCLS 2005--CLSI 2009), MIC (E-Test, ATB/ Expression, VITEK 2C). Screening of ESBL-producing strains performed with double disk-difussion method (DDD). Reference strains used: S. aureus ATCC 25923, S. pneumoniae ATCC 49619, E. coli A TCC 25922, Enterococcus fiecalis ATCC 29212. RESULTS: During the studied period, 245 bacterial strains have been isolated, identified and tested (Staphylococcus aureus / 70, Streptococcus pneumoniae / 61, Enterococcus faecalis / 18, Enterococcus faecium / 5, Neisseria meningitidis / 18, E. coli / 73). out of 166 hemocultures and 79 cerebrospinal fluids / CSF. The average incidence of MRSA strains in systemic infections was 34.28%. 44.28% of the S. aureus strains were resistant to erythromycin, 17.14% to cyprofloxacyne, 15.71% to rifampicine, 14.49% to gentamycine. No strain resistant to vancomycine and linezolide. Streptococcus pneumoniae presented an average high resistance to penicillin G of 11.47%. and a 1.63% resistance to third generation cephalosporines. 0% resistance to vancomycine and rifampicine. 7/ 18 Enterococcus faecalis strains and 4/5 Enterococcus faecium strains presented high level resistance to gentamycine (CN 120 microg/disk) and no strain was resistant to vancomycine, teicoplanin or linezolid. The 18 Neisseria meningitidis strains were all sensitive to beta-lactams, macrolides, fluoroquinolones and cloramphenicol. For the 73 Escherichia coli strains, the average incidence of ESBL-producing isolates was 10.95%, the average resistance to ampicillin was 58.90%, to gentamycine--13.88% and to cyprofloxacin--20.83%. No strain resistant to carbapenemes and amikacine. CONCLUSIONS: For the systematic surveillance of antibiotic resistance there is a need for a harmonised protocol of data gathering and strain selection and the rigurous implementation of correct evaluating methods for antibiotic resistance in the microbiology laboratory. Carbapenemes. glycopeptides and oxazolidinones still present a major effectiveness in the first intention treatment of systemic infections.
TI  - [Trends of antimicrobial resistance in microbial strains isolated from invasive infections in Romania. Experience of participation in EARSS (European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System), 2002-2008].
AB  - EARSS (European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System) is the biggest antimicrobial resistance surveillance project in the world financed from public finds, aiming to provide validated and comparable official data on antimicrobial resistance of invasive microbial strains (isolated from blood and CSF), belonging to 6 indicator bacterial species, i.e.: S. aureus, E. coli, E. faecium/faecalis, Str. pneumoniae, Ps. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae. Romania reported data to EARSS since 2002 so far. Though the number of participating laboratories increased progressively from 12 to 35, the number of hospitals which reported for EARSS. as the number of strains included in the data base remained steady and relatively low. This issue is related to the particular position of Romania in the European context, in respect of the very low number of blood cultures performed in hospitals. Our paper is presenting the trends of antimicrobial resistance in the indicator strains in the 2002-2008 interval. During the 2002-2008 interval, Romania reported to EARSS a total number of 1276 bacterial strains, distributed by species as follows: 513 S aureus, 369 E. coli, 128 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 127 Enterococcus spp.. 71 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 68 Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were reported, according to the EARSS protocol, only for the 2005-2008 interval. It is difficult to describe trends, specially in Enterococcus, Streptococcus pneumonaie and the 2 species collected only since 2005, because of the low number of isolates, but there are several results that are supporting us to claim that antimicrobial resistance in invasive isolates is a real problem in Romanian hospitals, like in other Central, Southern and South Eastern European countries: more than 25% of S. aureus strains resistant to methicilline, with more than 50% in some years, high aminoglycozides resistance in more than 70-80% of Enterococcus faecium invasive strains, more than 80% of strains resistant to 3rd generation cephalosporines etc.
TI  - N-Benzyl-3-sulfonamidopyrrolidines are a New Class of Bacterial DNA Gyrase Inhibitors.
AB  - This paper characterizes N-benzyl-3-sulfonamidopyrrolidines (gyramides) as DNA gyrase inhibitors. Gyramide A was previously shown to exhibit antimicrobial activity that suggested it inhibited bacterial cell division. In this study, we conducted target identification studies and identified DNA gyrase as the primary target of gyramide A. The gyramide A resistance-determining region in DNA gyrase is adjacent to the DNA cleavage gate and is a new site for inhibitor design. We studied the antibiotic effects of gyramides A-C in combination with the Gram-negative efflux pump inhibitor MC-207,110 (60 muM). The gyramides had a minimum inhibitory concentration of 10-40 muM against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enterica, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pneumoniae; the compounds were ineffective against Enterococcus faecalis. The IC(50) of gyramides A-C against E. coli DNA gyrase was 0.7- 3.3 muM. The N-benzyl-3-sulfonamidopyrrolidines described in this manuscript represent a starting point for development of antibiotics that bind a new site in DNA gyrase.
TI  - Azaphilones from the endophyte Chaetomium globosum.
AB  - Six new azaphilones, 5'-epichaetoviridin A (7), 4'-epichaetoviridin F (9), 12beta-hydroxychaetoviridin C (10), and chaetoviridins G-I (11-13), and six known azaphilones, chaetoviridins A-E (1-5) and 4'-epichaetoviridin A (8), were isolated from the endophytic fungus Chaetomium globosum cultivated in PDB medium for 21 days. The structure elucidation and the assignment of the relative configurations of the new natural products were based on detailed NMR and MS spectroscopic analyses. The structure of compound 1 was confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. The absolute configurations of compounds 4, 7, 8, and 12 were determined using Mosher's method. The antibiotic activity of the compounds was evaluated using an in vivo Caenorhabditis elegans infection model.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial efficacy of a silver alginate dressing on burn wound isolates.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To test the antimicrobial effectiveness of a silver alginate dressing  on opportunistic pathogens, namely meticillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) and meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Klebsiella spp., Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter sakazakii, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Chryseobacterium indologenes, Proteus vulgaris and Acinetobacter baumannii. METHOD: In total, 40 microorganisms were isolated from patients attending three burn centres in the US and evaluated for their susceptibility to a silver alginate wound dressing, employing a corrected zone of inhibition assay, conducted on Mueller Hinton agar (MHA). RESULTS: The sizes of the corrected zones of inhibition varied between and within genera. For example, all Acinetobacter baumannii strains were found to be sensitive to ionic silver at pH 7, with a mean of 2.8mm, compared with 3.5mm at pH 5.5. The silver alginate dressing also demonstrated activity on all strains of Enterobacter and Escherichia coli, with susceptibility to the silver alginate dressing enhanced at pH 5.5. For Enterococcus spp. the average corrected zone of inhibition at pH 7 was 3.6mm, versus 4.9mm at pH 5.5. All strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were found to be sensitive to the silver alginate dressing. The average corrected zone of inhibition was 6.9mm at pH 7, compared with 8mm at pH 5.5. For MRSA and Staphylococcus aureus, it ranged from 4.5mm to 7.5mm at pH 7. When the pH was decreased to 5.5, the corrected zone of inhibition increased. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the activity of a silver alginate dressing on a wide range of burn isolates, including antibiotic-resistant bacteria, isolated from three different burn centres in the US. It also highlights the possible importance of pH and its potential effects on antimicrobial performance and microbial susceptibility. However, more extensive testing is required to substantiate this.

TI  - Lactobacillus fermentum isolated from human colonic mucosal biopsy inhibits the growth and adhesion of enteric and foodborne pathogens.
AB  - A number of Lactobacillus species are used as probiotic strains in order to benefit health. We have isolated L. fermentum from human colonic mucosal biopsy samples that possess antimicrobial activities against entroinvasive and foodborne pathogens such as Escherichia coli, Salmonella paratyphi A, Shigella sonnei, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Vibrio sp. In addition to lactic acid, L. fermentum secretes antimicrobial proteinacious compound(s) that was found to be active even at neutral pH (pH 7.0). The compound was sensitive to heat treatment and trypsin digestion. Lactobacillus fermentum inhibited the adhesion of enteropathogens to intestinal epithelial cells in vitro. Isolated cell surface associated proteins (SAPs) from L. fermentum were sufficient for the adhesion exclusions of enteropathogenic E. coli. Our results indicate that L. fermentum produces antimicrobial compounds and SAPs to inhibit the growth and adhesion of enteropathogens, respectively.
TI  - Characterization of lactic acid bacteria isolated from Italian Bella di Cerignola table olives: selection of potential multifunctional starter cultures.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria (19 isolates) from Bella di Cerignola Italian table olives were investigated for their technological and probiotic properties for the selection of multifunctional starter cultures for table olives. The bacteria were first identified by phenotyping and genotyping, then characterized for the production of biogenic amines, growth at different pH, NaCl concentrations, and temperatures. The potentiality of the bacteria to have some probiotic properties (antimicrobial activity against foodborne pathogens, survival in low pH and in the presence of bile salts, ability to adhere to the mammalian cells model IPEC-J2) was also investigated. Eighteen of the studied isolates were identified as Lactobacillus plantarum and one as Enterococcus faecalis. All bacteria were able to grow at a range of pH between 4.0 and 10.0 as well as in media supplemented with 2.5 to 7.5% of NaCl and 0.3% bile salts and survived in MRS broth acidified at pH 2.5; moreover, they inhibited significantly Escherichia coli O157:H7. The adhesion to IPEC-J2 cells was in general low to moderate (5.3 to 8.3%); however, 2 isolates of L. plantarum (c16 and c19) showed interesting higher adhesion values (up to 16%). Our results suggest that at least 3 isolates could be possible multifunctional starters for Bella di Cerignola olives: L. plantarum 16 and 19 for mainly their probiotic properties and L. plantarum 10 for mainly its technological characteristics. Practical Application: A functional starter is a microorganism exerting benefits on human health (probiotic) and able to guide a fermentation (starter). The main goal of this article was to select a functional starter for table olives.
TI  - Clinical course and outcomes of single-organism Enterococcus peritonitis in peritoneal dialysis patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Enterococci are part of the normal flora of the gastrointestinal tract. They can cause enteric peritonitis, which is a serious complication of peritoneal dialysis (PD). However, the clinical course and outcome of PD-related Enterococcus peritonitis remains unclear. METHODS: We reviewed all Enterococcus peritonitis episodes occurring in our dialysis unit from 1995 to 2009. RESULTS: During the study period, 1421 episodes of peritonitis were recorded. Of 29 episodes (2.0%) that were attributable to single-organism Enterococcus, 12 episodes were caused by E. faecalis; 9, by E. faecium; and the remaining 8, by other Enterococcus species. The overall rate of ampicillin resistance was 41.4%. Recent use of antibiotics was associated with the development of ampicillin-resistant Enterococcus (ARE) peritonitis (hazard ratio: 12.53; p = 0.04). The primary response rate of Enterococcus peritonitis was significantly higher than that of Escherichia coli peritonitis (89.7% vs. 69.9%, p = 0.038), but the primary response rate was not significantly lower for ARE peritonitis than for ampicillin-susceptible Enterococcus (ASE) peritonitis (83.3% vs. 94.1%, p = 0.553). However, significantly more patients with ARE had received vancomycin (83.3% vs. 23.5%, p = 0.003), with a longer mean duration of vancomycin treatment (11.8 +/- 6.9 days vs. 3.7 +/- 6.8 days, p = 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Recent use of antibiotics was a risk factor for the development of ARE peritonitis. Outcomes in ASE and ARE peritonitis were similar, but vancomycin was required during treatment for ARE peritonitis, in turn possibly predisposing the patients to infections caused by vancomycin-resistant organisms.
TI  - Identification of malic and soluble oxaloacetate decarboxylase enzymes in Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - Two paralogous genes, maeE and citM, that encode putative malic enzyme family members were identified in the Enterococcus faecalis genome. MaeE (41 kDa) and CitM (42 kDa) share a high degree of homology between them (47% identities and 68% conservative substitutions). However, the genetic context of each gene suggested that maeE is associated with malate utilization whereas citM is linked to the citrate fermentation pathway. In the present work, we focus on the biochemical characterization and physiological contribution of these enzymes in E. faecalis. With this aim, the recombinant versions of the two proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli, affinity purified and finally their kinetic parameters were determined. This approach allowed us to establish that MaeE is a malate oxidative decarboxylating enzyme and CitM is a soluble oxaloacetate decarboxylase. Moreover, our genetic studies in E. faecalis showed that the citrate fermentation phenotype is not affected by citM deletion. On the other hand, maeE gene disruption resulted in a malate fermentation deficient strain indicating that MaeE is responsible for malate metabolism in E. faecalis. Lastly, it was demonstrated that malate fermentation in E. faecalis is associated with cytoplasmic and extracellular alkalinization which clearly contributes to pH homeostasis in neutral or mild acidic conditions.
TI  - Bacterial monocultures, propionate, butyrate and H2O2 modulate the expression, secretion and structure of the fasting-induced adipose factor in gut epithelial cell lines.
AB  - Previous research showed that an intestinal microbial community represses the fasting-induced adipose factor (FIAF) in the gut epithelium, thereby increasing fat storage in the host. This study was designed to investigate the overall effect of different bacterial species and metabolites on FIAF in intestinal (Caco-2, HT-29 and HCT-116) and hepatic (HepG2) cancer cell lines. First, we showed that FIAF was present in different isoforms, and secreted as N-glycosylated proteins, exclusively at the basal side of the cell monolayer. Second, co-incubation of cell lines with bacterial monocultures and metabolites altered both FIAF production and isoform appearance. Propionate and/or butyrate treatment increased FIAF expression and cleavage in all tested cell lines. In contrast, different bacteria induced cell line-specific FIAF modulation. Clostridium perfringens induced FIAF isoform changes in Caco-2 cells. Enterococcus faecalis and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron treatment resulted in cell line-specific FIAF increases, whereas Escherichia coli significantly decreased FIAF expression in HCT-116 cells. Treatment with H(2) O(2) and peroxide-producing E. faecalis strains induced FIAF isoform changes in Caco-2 cells. Since bacteria and bacterial metabolites alter both FIAF production and isoform appearance, further investigation may reveal an important role for bacteria in FIAF-regulated physiological processes, such as cell differentiation and fat metabolism.
TI  - Enterococcus faecalis sufCDSUB complements Escherichia coli sufABCDSE.
AB  - Iron-sulfur [Fe-S] clusters are inorganic prosthetic groups that play essential roles in all living organisms. Iron and sulfur mobilization, formation of [Fe-S] clusters, and delivery to its final protein targets involves a complex set of specific protein machinery. Proteobacteria has three systems of [Fe-S] biogenesis, designated NIF, ISC, and SUF. In contrast, the Firmicutes system is not well characterized and has only one system, formed mostly by SUF homologs. The Firmicutes phylum corresponds to a group of pathological bacteria, of which Enterococcus faecalis is a clinically relevant representative. Recently, the E. faecalis sufCDSUB [Fe-S] cluster biosynthetic machinery has been identified, although there is no further information available about the similarities and/or variations of Proteobacteria and Firmicutes systems. The aim of the present work was to compare the ability of the different Proteobacteria and Firmicutes systems to complement the Azotobacter vinelandii and Escherichia coli ISC and SUF systems. Indeed, E. faecalis sufCDSUB is able to complement the E. coli SUF system, allowing viable mutants of both sufABCDSE and iscRSU-hscBA-fdx systems. The presence of all E. faecalis SUF factors enables proper functional interactions, which would not otherwise occur in proteins from different systems.
TI  - Persistence and diversity of faecal coliform and enterococci populations in faecally polluted waters.
AB  - AIM: To assess the persistence and diversity of faecal bacterial populations (faecal coliforms and enterococci) that have recently been included in microbial source tracking (MST) predictive models. METHODS AND RESULTS: The analysed bacterial populations included members of the enterococci group (ENT) [Enterococcus faecium (FM), Enterococcus faecalis (FS) and Enterococcus hirae (HIR)] and the faecal coliform group (FC) [diverse Escherichia coli phenotypes (ECP) and cellobiose-negative faecal coliforms (CNFC)]. The inactivation of these distinct groups was monitored over time on-site in river by biochemical fingerprinting, and diversity indices were calculated. Among the different analysed species belonging to the ENT group, HIR persisted longer and was able to replicate in the environment at a higher rate. On the other hand, ECP and NCFC showed a similar persistence throughout the different seasons. The diversity index (Di) for FC increased substantially in the summer after 96 h to a maximum value of 0.96. On the other hand, the Di for ENT diminished over the same period to a value of 0.86, suggesting a different persistence for the different species integrating this group. CONCLUSIONS: The persistence of ECP, CNFC, FM and FS in the aquatic environment is high, particularly for the members of the FC and in the summer season. On the contrary, HIR is able to replicate in the environment at a high rate even in winter, and therefore, its inclusion in MST predictive models is discouraged. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: ECP, CNFC, FMFS and HIR have been proposed as additional variables in MST predictive models. However, the different persistence of HIR compared with the other variables should be taken into account for the development of such models.
TI  - Microbial ethanol production: experimental study and multivariate evaluation.
AB  - Ethanol can be produced from all the postmortem available substrates, though with higher rates and yields from carbohydrates, during the early stages of putrefaction. The so-called higher alcohols (1-propanol, isobutanol, 2-methyl-1-butanol and 3-methyl-2-butanol) and 1-butanol could be produced, from all the available postmortem substrates. However, a quantitative relationship between the produced ethanol and the potentially produced other alcohols is still missing. The objective of this study was the development of a simple, mathematical model which could be able to approximate the microbial produced ethanol in correlation with other produced alcohols. The selected bacterial species included two Gram+ spore-forming anaerobic bacteria and two (one Gram+ one Gram-) aerobic/facultative anaerobic bacteria, all being common commensals of the digestive tract and common colonizers of the corpse. The selected bacterial strains, Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfrigens, Clostridium sporogenes and Enterococcus faecalis, were cultured separately at 25 degrees C, for 30 days, under controlled anaerobic conditions. The produced ethanol and the previously referred alcohols were determined in the culture medium in 24h intervals. Using partial least squares (PLS) regression, the estimation of the relevance score for the available descriptors established the statistical model to assess the ethanol concentration produced by each studied microbe. E. coli, C. perfrigens, and C. sporogenes produced different patterns of ethanol and other alcohols, while E. faecalis produced negligible amounts of ethanol and higher alcohols. In constructing the mathematical models to predict the produced ethanol, 1-propanol, 1-butanol, and isobutanol were significant for C. perfrigens and C. sporogenes, while 1-butanol, 1-propanol, and methyl-butanol were significant for E. coli. The applicability of these models was tested in microbial, anaerobic cultures of normal human blood and plasma at 25 degrees C. The results indicate that factors such as the type of microbe species, the glucose content and the medium composition apparently affect the procedure of microbial ethanol, and other alcohols production. However, the models can be applied with acceptable accuracy and they show potential for application in real postmortem cases.
TI  - The challenges of antimicrobial resistance in Brazil.
AB  - Brazil is a country with continental proportions with high geographic and economic diversity. Despite its medical centers of excellence, antimicrobial resistance poses a major therapeutic challenge. Rates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus are up to 60% and are related to an endemic Brazilian clone. Local resistance to vancomycin in Enterococci was first related to Enterococcus faecalis, which differs from European and American epidemiology. Also, local Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli isolates producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases have a much higher prevalence (40%-50% and 10%-18%, respectively). Carbapenem resistance among the enterobacteriaceae group is becoming a major problem, and K. pneumoniae carbapenemase isolates have been reported in different states. Among nonfermenters, carbapenem resistance is strongly related to SPM-1 (Pseudomonasaeruginosa) and OXA-23 (Acinetobacter baumannii complex) enzymes, and a colistin-only susceptible phenotype has also emerged in these isolates, which is worrisome. Local actions without loosing the global resistance perspective will demand multidisciplinary actions, new policies, and political engagement.
TI  - Short-term antimicrobial properties of mineral trioxide aggregate with incorporated silver-zeolite.
AB  - The purpose of this in vitro study was to determine whether adding silver-zeolite (SZ) to mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) would enhance the antimicrobial activity of MTA against Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC #25923), Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC #29212), Escherichia coli (ATCC#25922), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC #27853), Candida albicans (ATCC #90028), Porphyromonas gingivalis (ATCC #33277), Actinomyces israelii (ATCC #12102), and Prevotella intermedia (ATCC# 15032). SZ was added at 0.2% and 2% mass fraction concentration to MTA powder. The control group was MTA powder with no SZ. The antimicrobial effect test was accomplished by placing freshly mixed MTA specimens on agar plates inoculated with microorganisms and comparing the zones of inhibition at 24, 48, and 72 h. The amounts of silver ion release from MTA specimens were measured with atomic absorption spectrophotometry at 10-min, 24-, 48-, and 72-h periods. The pH of MTA specimens was measured with a pH meter at 10-min, 24-, 48-, and 72-h periods. MTA with 2% and 0.2% SZ specimens showed inhibitory effects on some microorganisms at all time periods, whereas no antimicrobial activity showed for P. intermedia and A. israelii. MTA without SZ inhibited C. albicans, E. Coli, and P. intermedia. The highest silver release was detected in 2% SZ MTA at 24 h. The incorporation of SZ may enhance the antimicrobial activity of MTA.
TI  - Urine cultures from indwelling bladder catheters in nursing home patients: a point prevalence study in a Swedish county.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To survey the bacterial flora and antibiotic resistance in urinary strains from patients with indwelling bladder catheters residing in nursing homes within a geographically defined region. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Urine was sampled for culture from 163 catheter patients (126 men and 37 women) during a 2 week period in March 2010. Susceptibility testing of the isolated bacteria was compared with all urinary strains (n = 9994) from hospitals and primary healthcare in the same geographical area cultured during the first 6 months of 2010 (control group). RESULTS: Bacteriuria was found in 159 of 163 urine samples (98%). Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli were the most common species, one or both being detected in 72% of the urine samples, while Proteus species were found in10% and a single isolate of Providentia species was seen.Strains in the study patients were more resistant to antibiotics than in the control group. Particularly large differences were noted for ciprofloxacinin in E. coli (16.9% vs 7.9%) and for trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in E. faecalis (39.1% vs 24.8%). One extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing E. coli was cultured (1.3%), compared with 1.6% in the control group. No vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) were detected. CONCLUSIONS: Proteus mirabilis and Providentia species were rarely isolated, in sharp contrast to previous studies from geriatric hospital wards where they have often been in the majority. The limited incidence of ESBL and the absence of VRE and MRSA is gratifying, but the high resistance to antibiotics needs to be assessed on a continuous basis.
TI  - Biofunctionalization of silicone polymers using poly(amidoamine) dendrimers and a mannose derivative for prolonged interference against pathogen colonization.
AB  - Despite numerous preventive strategies on bacterial adhesion, pathogenic biofilm  formation remained the major cause of medical device-related infections. Bacterial interference is a promising strategy that uses pre-established biofilms of benign bacteria to serve as live, protective coating against pathogen colonization. However, the application of this strategy to silicone urinary catheters was hampered by low adherence of benign bacteria onto silicone materials. In this work, we present a general method for biofunctionalization of silicone (PDMS) as one of the most widely used materials for biomedical devices. We used mild CO(2) plasma to activate PDMS surface followed by simple attachment of generation 5 (G5) poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimers to generate an amino-terminated surface that were maintained even after storage in PBS buffer for 36 days. We then covalently attach a carboxy-terminated mannose derivative to the modified PDMS to promote the adherence of benign Escherichia coli 83972 expressing mannose-binding type 1 fimbriae. We demonstrated that dense, stable biofilms of E. coli 83972 could be established within 48 h on the mannose-coated PDMS. Significantly, this benign biofilm reduced the adherence of the uropathogenic Enterococcus faecalis by 104-fold after 72 h, while the benign bacteria on the unmodified substrate by only 5.5-fold.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of the essential oil of Greek endemic Stachys spruneri and its main component, isoabienol.
AB  - The essential oils of Stachys spruneri Boiss. (sample A and sample B) were analyzed by GC and GC-MS. (+)-Isoabienol was the dominant component (49.5 and 48.2%, respectively of the total oils) among seventy-two identified constituents. Isoabienol was separated, purified by preparative thin-layer chromatography, and further identified by means ofphysicochemical and spectrometric analysis. The microbial growth inhibitory properties of the essential oil and its main metabolite, the labdane diterpene isoabienol, were determined using the broth microdilution method against eight laboratory strains of bacteria (Gram-positive: Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Micrococcus luteus, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis, and Gram- negative: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and two strains of the yeast Candida albicans. Both essential oil and isoabienol showed considerable activity against all the microorganisms tested, with the isolated compound being most active.
TI  - Monitoring of multiple drug-resistant pathogens in a selected stretch of Bay of Bengal, India.
AB  - The present work aims at identification of multiple drug-resistant pathogenic bacteria in a selected stretch, namely, Puri on the Bay of Bengal, India. Six stations at the coast of Puri were selected and samples of water and sediment were collected during the winter of 2008 and 2009 for this study. Thirty-eight pathogenic bacteria were isolated and identified from both the water and the sediment of 6 fixed stations (PU-1a, PU-1b, PU-2, PU-3, PU-4, and PU-5). The identified pathogens were Escherichia coli, Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus mirabilis. Antibiotic sensitivity of the isolated bacteria was studied by using 12 selected antibiotics, commonly used for the medication of human beings and animals. The isolated pathogens from both the water and the sediment samples showed lowest resistance to chloramphenicol (C-30 mug) where as the pathogens showed highest level of resistance to ampicillin (10-mug) among the antibiotics used for the study. Among the isolated pathogens E. faecalis (PU-1a), P. aeruginosa (PU-2 and PU-3), E. coli (PU-3 and PU-4), and K. pneumonia (PU-4) showed resistance to more than four antibiotics. Out of the isolated species, 57.8% pathogens were multi-drug resistant. Antibiotic resistance indexes of all the stations were calculated and found to be in the range of 0.066 to 0.083.
TI  - Spectrum of early-onset and late-onset bacteremias after liver transplantation: implications for management.
AB  - Bacteremia is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality after liver transplantation. The characterization of the microbiological spectrum of bacteremia after liver transplantation may help physicians in choosing the initial empirical antimicrobial therapy for patients presenting with sepsis. The clinical and microbiology records of patients who received liver transplantation from January 1997 to March 2006 were reviewed. One hundred twenty-three of the 737 liver recipients (16.7%) developed bacteremia during the median follow-up period of 5.8 years (interquartile range = 2.5-8.8 years); 92 patients (12.5%) had gram-positive bacteremia (GPB), whereas 47 (6.4%) had gram-negative bacteremia (GNB). Nosocomial bacteremia was significantly more frequent among patients with early-onset GPB or GNB versus patients with late-onset GPB (66.7% versus 23.7%, P < 0.001) or GNB (70.6% versus 20.0%, P = 0.001). Peritonitis (33.3% versus 7.9%, P = 0.004) and wound infections (13.0% versus 0%, P = 0.04) as sources were more common in patients with early-onset GPB versus patients with late-onset GPB. Likewise, peritonitis was a more common source of early-onset GNB than late-onset GNB (41.2% versus 6.7%, P = 0.007). Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecium were the most common pathogens in patients with early-onset GPB, whereas Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus species were most common in patients with late-onset GPB. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and anaerobes were the most common pathogens in patients with early-onset GNB, whereas Escherichia coli was most common in patients with late-onset GNB. In conclusion, the microbiological spectra of early-onset and late-onset bacteremias differ, and this should be considered by those determining the initial empirical treatment of liver transplant recipients suspected to have bacteremias.
TI  - Need for improved antimicrobial and infection control stewardship in Vietnamese intensive care units.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Survey of antibiotic consumption, microbial resistance and hygiene precautions in the intensive care units of three hospitals in northern Vietnam. METHODS: Observational study. Data were collected from the microbiological laboratories. Antibiotic consumption was determined based on quantities of drugs delivered from the pharmacy. A protocol to observe the application of hygiene precautions was developed and used. Bacteria were typed and tested for drug susceptibility using the disc-diffusion method. RESULTS: The mean antibiotic consumption was 811 defined daily doses per 1000 occupied bed days. The most commonly used antibiotics were third-generation cephalosporins, followed by carbapenems, amoxicillin and ampicillin. Eighty per cent of bacterial isolates were Gram-negative. The most common pathogens found in blood cultures were Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp., Pseudomonas spp., Acinetobacter spp., Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis. Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas spp. were the two most frequently isolated bacteria from the respiratory tract and all other sources together. Seventy per cent of Acinetobacter species showed reduced susceptibility to imipenem, 80% to ciprofloxacin and 89% to ceftazidime. Forty-four per cent of Pseudomonas spp. showed reduced susceptibility to imipenem, 49% to ciprofloxacin and 49% to ceftazidime. Escherichia coli was fully susceptible to imipenem, but 57% of samples were resistant to both ciprofloxacin and cefotaxime. Hygiene precautions were poor, and fewer than 50% of patient contacts incorporated appropriate hand hygiene. CONCLUSION: Low antibiotic consumption, poor hygiene precautions and the high level of antibiotic resistance indicate that there is room for improvement regarding antibiotic use and infection control.
TI  - Association of red complex, A. actinomycetemcomitans and non-oral bacteria with periodontal diseases.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Pathogens related to systemic infections have been detected in the periodontal microbiota. The relationship amongst these pathogens, periodontal bacteria and periodontal clinical status is poorly understood. This study evaluated the association amongst red complex, A. actinomycetemcomitans (A.a) and non-oral pathogenic bacteria in subjects with good periodontal health (PH), gingivitis (G), chronic (CP) and aggressive (AP) periodontitis. METHODS: Subgingival biofilm samples were obtained from 51 PH, 42 G, 219 CP and 90 AP subjects. The presence and levels of A.a, red complex (Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, Treponema denticola), Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus were determined by DNA probes and DNA-DNA hybridization technique. RESULTS: CP and AP subjects presented significantly higher prevalence and levels of A.a, red complex and A. baumannii than G and PH individuals (p<0.01), whereas S. aureus was detected in lower frequency and counts in AP as compared to the other groups (p<0.001). The predictor variables age, prevalence of red complex, and the presence of A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa were strongly associated with the frequency of sites with PD and CAL >/=5 mm. Increasing age (OR 1.08), high frequency of red complex (OR 6.10), and the presence of A.a with P. aeruginosa (OR 1.90) were associated with periodontal disease (p<0.001). Subjects harbouring a high prevalence of A.a, A. baumannii, and red complex with P. aeruginosa were more likely to have AP than CP (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: Putative periodontal pathogens and non-oral bacteria alone or in association were strongly associated with periodontitis.
TI  - Prevalence and epidemiology of microbial pathogens causing bloodstream infections: results of the OASIS multicenter study.
AB  - Beginning on April 2007, a prospective multicenter study was performed to investigate prevalence and epidemiology of microbial pathogens causing bloodstream infections (BSIs). Twenty microbiology laboratories participated to the survey over a 1-year period. A total of 11,638 episodes of BSI occurred in 11 202 patients, with 8.5% (n=985) of episodes being polymicrobial. Of 12 781 causative organisms, aerobic Gram-negative bacteria were 47.4% (n=6058), whereas Gram-positives accounted for 43.9% (n=5608). The remaining organisms included fungal species (n=924, 7.2%) and anaerobes (n=191, 1.5%). The most prevalent agents were Escherichia coli (21.7%), Staphylococcus aureus (14.9%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (8.2%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7.0%), and Enterococcus faecalis (6.3%). Isolates recovered from patients admitted to medical, surgical, and intensive care units accounted for 62.9%, 17.7%, and 19.4% of cases, respectively. BSIs were classified as hospital-acquired in 67.2% of cases. Compared with previous studies, our data show an increasing role of Gram-negative bacteria among both hospital- and community-acquired blood isolates.
TI  - Cytotoxicity, antiviral and antimicrobial activities of alkaloids, flavonoids, and phenolic acids.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Some natural products consisting of the alkaloids yohimbine and vincamine (indole-type), scopolamine and atropine (tropane-type), colchicine (tropolone-type), allantoin (imidazolidine-type), trigonelline (pyridine-type) as well as octopamine, synephrine, and capsaicin (exocyclic amine-type); the flavonoid derivatives quercetin, apigenin, genistein, naringin, silymarin, and silibinin; and the phenolic acids namely gallic acid, caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, and quinic acid, were tested for their in vitro antiviral, antibacterial, and antifungal activities and cytotoxicity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Antiviral activity of the compounds was tested against DNA virus herpes simplex type 1 and RNA virus parainfluenza (type-3). Cytotoxicity of the compounds was determined using Madin-Darby bovine kidney and Vero cell lines, and their cytopathogenic effects were expressed as maximum non-toxic concentration. Antibacterial activity was assayed against following bacteria and their isolated strains: Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Bacillus subtilis, although they were screened by microdilution method against two fungi: Candida albicans and Candida parapsilosis. RESULTS: Atropine and gallic acid showed potent antiviral effect at the therapeutic range of 0.8-0.05 microg ml(-1), whilst all of the compounds exerted robust antibacterial effect. CONCLUSION: Antiviral and antimicrobial effects of the compounds tested herein may constitute a preliminary step for further relevant studies to identify the mechanism of action.
TI  - A screening of curcumin derivatives for antibacterial phototoxic effects studies  on curcumin and curcuminoids. XLIII.
AB  - Curcumin, bis(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-1,6-heptadiene-3,5-dione, has potential  as a photosensitiser for photodynamic treatment of localised superficial infections in e.g., the mouth or skin. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the in vitro antibacterial phototoxic potential of a series of five curcumin derivatives. The gram-positive Enterococcus faecalis and the gram-negative Escherichia coli were used as bacterial models. The bacteria were exposed to curcuminoid preparations in two concentrations (2.5 and 25.0 microM) in combination with a constant irradiation dose (5 J/cm2). The UV-VIS absorption spectrum of the curcuminoids was in the same range as curcumin, 300-500 nm. Compound 1 (dimethoxycurcumin; C1) and compound 3 (bisdemethoxycurcumin; C3) were strongly phototoxic towards E. faecalis (no surviving bacteria) and showed a lower but significant effect towards E. coli (< or = 0.5 log reductions and 1 - 4 log reductions, respectively). Compound 2 (C2) and compound 4 (C4) in combination with blue light reduced the colony forming ability of E. faecalis (approximately 1-4 log reductions). The phototoxic effect of the curcuminoids varied with concentration, and for compounds C1, C2 and C3 it was further influenced by the addition of polyethylene glycol 400 (PEG 400) to the preparations. 2,6-Divanillylidenecyclohexanone (C5) showed very low phototoxic potential (< 0.2 log reductions) under the conditions used in the present study. The addition of polyethylene glycol 400 (PEG 400) seemed to increase the solubility of compound C1, C3 and C5 in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). This investigation demonstrates the importance and influence of the substituents on the phenolic rings and the keto-enol moiety for the phototoxic potential of curcumin and its derivatives.
TI  - In vitro activity of ceftobiprole against frequently encountered aerobic and facultative Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial pathogens: results of the CANWARD 2007-2009 study.
AB  - The in vitro activity of ceftobiprole was evaluated against 15 011 clinical isolates obtained from patients in Canadian hospitals between 2007 and 2009. All Staphylococcus aureus were susceptible to ceftobiprole (MIC(90)'s for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus of </= 1 mug/mL and 2 mug/mL, respectively). Ceftobiprole was active against penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC(90), </= 0.06 mug/mL), penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC(90), 0.5 mug/mL), Streptococcus pyogenes (MIC(90), </= 0.06 mug/mL), Staphylococcus epidermidis (MIC(90), </= 1 mug/mL), and Enterococcus faecalis (MIC(90), </= 1 mug/mL). Over 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, and Serratia marcescens isolates were inhibited by a ceftobiprole concentration of </= 1 mug/mL. Ceftobiprole was not active against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli and K. pneumoniae. The in vitro activity of ceftobiprole versus Pseudomonas aeruginosa was similar to that of cefepime (MIC(90), 16 mug/mL). The broad spectrum of activity by ceftobiprole would support further study of this agent in the treatment of hospital-acquired infections.
TI  - Prevalence of antimicrobial resistant pathogens from blood cultures from Canadian hospitals: results of the CANWARD 2007-2009 study.
AB  - This study assessed the epidemiology and antimicrobial resistance of pathogens associated with bloodstream infections in Canadian hospitals between 2007 and 2009. Tertiary-care medical centers representing 8 of 10 Canadian provinces submitted bloodstream infection pathogens from patients attending hospital clinics, emergency rooms, medical/surgical wards, and intensive care units. Over 8,000 blood culture pathogens were collected. The 10 most common pathogens (representing 80.9% of all isolates) were Escherichia coli (1856 [22.6%]), Staphylococcus aureus (1457 [17.7%] including 1101 methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and 356 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus), coagulase-negative staphylococci (907 [11.0%]), Klebsiella pneumoniae (600 [7.3%]), Streptococcus pneumoniae (470 [5.7%]), Enterococcus faecalis (360 [4.4%]), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (333 [4.0%]), viridans group streptococci (321 [3.9%]), Enterobacter cloacae (193 [2.3%]), and Streptococcus pyogenes (159 [1.9%]). The most active agents against Gram-negative bacilli were carbapenems (e.g., meropenem and ertapenem) and piperacillin-tazobactam, while for Gram-positive cocci, they were vancomycin, linezolid, and daptomycin.
TI  - Antibacterial efficacy of raw and processed honey.
AB  - In vitro antibacterial activity of methanol, ethanol, and ethyl acetate extracts  of raw and processed honey was tested against Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Micrococcus luteus) and Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella typhi). Both types of honey showed antibacterial activity against tested organisms with the zone of inhibition (ZOI) ranging from 6.94 to 37.94 mm, while E. coli, S. typhi, and P. aeruginosa showed that sensibility towards all the extracts with ZOI ranges between 13.09 to 37.94 mm. The methanol extract showed more potent activity than other organic extracts. Gram-negative bacteria were found to be more susceptible as compared to Gram-positive bacteria except E. faecalis. The broth microdilution assay gave minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) value of 625 mug/mL, while the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) ranges between 625 mug/mL 2500 mug/mL. The study showed that honey has antibacterial activity (bacteriostatic and bactericidal effect), similar to antibiotics, against test organisms and provides alternative therapy against certain bacteria.
TI  - [Epidemic hazard of water use in the reactivation of bacteria after disinfection].
AB  - Variability in the cultural and biochemical properties of indicator, opportunistic, and pathogenic bacteria and possibilities of their reactivation after exposure to chlorine-containing reagents and during photo-activated disinfection processes in the presence of photosensitizes were experimentally studied to enhance the epidemic reliability and adequacy of microbiological monitoring in the evaluation of the decontamination efficiency of water of its various use types. Reactivation of coliform bacteria, enterococci, salmonellas, and the total number of microbes were estimated after exposure to the bacteriostatic doses of sodium hypochlorite and chlorine dioxide when the river and waste waters were decontaminated. During photo-activated disinfection under the action of the photosensitizers methylene blue and proflavin acetate given in the bacteriostatic doses, there was transition into the uncultivated state, followed by 1-5-day reactivation of both museum strains and strains isolated from waste waters, such as Salmonella infantis spp, Salmonella enteritidis spp, Salmonella enteritidis 5765 ATCC, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 10145, Pseudomonas aeruginosa spp, Escherichia coli 1257, Staphylococcus aureus 906, and Enterococcus faecalis 29212. Moreover, Pseudomonas and Salmonellas not only regained their viability, but also multiplied up to the control level. Recommendations are given how to improve methods for monitoring the efficiency of disinfection, by taking into account a possible variability in the cultural and biochemical properties of bacteria and for reactivation by monitoring the trend in the process during 5 days.
TI  - Development of a DNA microarray for enterococcal species, virulence, and antibiotic resistance gene determinations among isolates from poultry.
AB  - A DNA microarray (Enteroarray) was designed with probes targeting four species-specific taxonomic identifiers to discriminate among 18 different enterococcal species, while other probes were designed to identify 18 virulence factors and 174 antibiotic resistance genes. In total, 262 genes were utilized for rapid species identification of enterococcal isolates, while characterizing their virulence potential through the simultaneous identification of endogenous antibiotic resistance and virulence genes. Enterococcal isolates from broiler chicken farms were initially identified by using the API 20 Strep system, and the results were compared to those obtained with the taxonomic genes atpA, recA, pheS, and ddl represented on our microarray. Among the 171 isolates studied, five different enterococcal species were identified by using the API 20 Strep system: Enterococcus faecium, E. faecalis, E. durans, E. gallinarum, and E. avium. The Enteroarray detected the same species as API 20 Strep, as well as two more: E. casseliflavus and E. hirae. Species comparisons resulted in 15% (27 isolates) disagreement between the two methods among the five API 20 Strep identifiable species and 24% (42 isolates) disagreement when considering the seven Enteroarray identified species. The species specificity of key antibiotic and virulence genes identified by the Enteroarray were consistent with the literature adding further robustness to the redundant taxonomic probe data. Sequencing of the cpn60 gene further confirmed the complete accuracy of the microarray results. The new Enteroarray should prove to be a useful tool to accurately genotype strains of enterococci and assess their virulence potential.
TI  - Bactericidal paper impregnated with silver nanoparticles for point-of-use water treatment.
AB  - There is an urgent need for cheap point-of-use methods to purify drinking water.  We describe a method to deactivate pathogenic bacteria by percolation through a paper sheet containing silver nanoparticles. The silver nanoparticles are deposited by the in situ reduction of silver nitrate on the cellulose fibers of an absorbent blotting paper sheet. The aim is to achieve inactivation of bacteria during percolation through the sheet, rather than removal of bacteria from the effluent by filtration. The silver-nanoparticle containing (AgNP) papers were tested for performance in the laboratory with respect to bacteria inactivation and silver leaching as suspensions of bacteria percolated through the paper. The AgNP sheets exhibited antibacterial properties toward suspensions of Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis, with log reduction values in the effluent of over log 6 and log 3, respectively. The silver loss from the AgNP sheets was minimal, with values under 0.1 ppm (the current US EPA and WHO limit for silver in drinking water). These results show promise that percolation of bacterially contaminated water through paper embedded with silver nanoparticles could be an effective emergency water treatment.
TI  - Thrombocytes are effectors of the innate immune system releasing human beta defensin-3.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Thrombocyte concentrate i.e. platelet-rich plasma (PRP) has become a  popular adjunct for many surgical procedures. It is believed to improve bone and soft tissue healing. Recently antimicrobial effects of the autologous preparation were reported by several groups. In this study we investigated the antimicrobial effect of PRP against gram-negative microbes which frequently cause severe complications in orthopaedic trauma surgery. METHODS: Platelet-rich plasma was produced from liquid preserved thrombocyte concentrates. ELISA, Western blot and immunohistochemistry were preformed to investigate the release and content of platelet concentrates. A radial diffusion assay was used to detect antimicrobial effects of PRP. RESULTS: We detected the human beta defensin-3 in bactericidal concentrations in platelet preparations by ELISA, Western blot and immunohistochemistry. In antimicrobial testing we demonstrated effective inhibition of Escherichia coli (ATCC 11303), Bacterium megaterium (ATCC 14581), Klebsiella pneumoniae (ATCC 13883), Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29212) and Proteus mirabilis (ATCC21100). CONCLUSION: With this study we demonstrate antimicrobial action of a popular adjunct for orthopaedic and trauma surgery against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. We have identified a possible mechanism of action via the secretion of HBD-3 as a first line defence in contaminated wounds and in elective application of PRP. This finding supports a broader spectrum of clinical indications for an autologous platelet preparation.
TI  - Triterpenoid saponins from Symplocos lancifolia.
AB  - Three new bidesmosidic saponins (1-3) and a new ursane triterpenoid, 2alpha,3beta,11alpha,23-tetrahydroxyurs-12-en-28-oic acid (4), along with seven known compounds, were isolated from a methanolic extract of the leaves of Symplocos lancifolia. The bidesmosidic saponins were found to possess the same sugar unit part, composed of two beta-d-glucose moieties and one alpha-l-rhamnose moiety, linked to maslinic acid, arjunolic acid, and asiatic acid, respectively. Their structures were elucidated by interpretation of their 1D and 2D NMR spectra and completed by analysis of the HRESIMS data. The antibacterial activity of the isolated triterpenoids was evaluated against Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and several showed activity against Gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Comparison of two diode lasers on bactericidity in root canals--an in vitro study.
AB  - This in vitro study compares two 810-nm and 940-nm diode lasers on bacterial kill in root canals of extracted human teeth and shows the clinical relevance of different treatment modalities. Ninety root canals of single-rooted human teeth were prepared up to ISO 70, steam sterilized, and assigned to two test groups (810 nm, 940 nm) and one control group. Following an initiatory experiment in which access opening of root canals and surrounding cavity were excluded from irradiation in the main experiment, 60 teeth were inoculated with 2 mul of either Escherichia coli or Enterococcus faecalis suspension. Laser irradiation was performed, additionally including access opening of root canals and surrounding cavity in the laser treatment. Excluding access opening of root canals and surrounding cavity from the laser treatment, the diode laser achieved an average bacterial reduction of Escherichia coli of 76.06% (810 nm) and 68.15% (940 nm), while including access cavities showed an average bacterial reduction of Escherichia coli of 97.84% (810 nm) and 98.83% (940 nm) and an average bacterial reduction of Enterococcus faecalis of 98.8% (810 nm) and 98.66% (940 nm). Diode laser wavelengths are effective in endodontic therapy. It seems to be clinically relevant that additional irradiation of the access cavity produces significantly better bactericidal results.
TI  - Intestinal microbiota was assessed in cirrhotic patients with hepatitis B virus infection. Intestinal microbiota of HBV cirrhotic patients.
AB  - To unravel the profile of intestinal microecological parameters in Chinese patients with asymptomatic carriage of hepatitis B virus (HBV), chronic hepatitis B, decompensated HBV cirrhosis, and health controls and to establish their correlation with liver disease progression, we performed quantitative PCR and immunological techniques to investigate fecal parameters, including population of fecal predominant bacteria and the abundance of some virulence genes derived from Escherichia coli, Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium difficile, and Clostridium perfringens in fecal crude DNA and some immunological parameters in extracts of all fecal samples. Data analysis indicated that 16S rRNA gene copy numbers for Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterobacteriaceae, bifidobacteria, and lactic acid bacteria (Lactobacillus, Pediococcus, Leuconostoc, and Weissella) showed marked variation in the intestine of HBV cirrhotic patients. The Bifidobacteria/Enterobacteriaceae (B/E) ratio, which may indicate microbial colonization resistance of the bowel, was decreased significantly in turn from 1.15 +/- 0.11 in healthy controls, 0.99 +/- 0.09 in asymptomatic carriers, and 0.76 +/- 0.08 in patients with chronic hepatitis B to 0.64 +/- 0.09 in patients with decompensated HBV cirrhosis (for all, P < 0.01). This suggests that B/E ratio is useful for following the level of intestinal microecological disorder in the course of liver disease progression. The data for virulence gene abundance suggested increased diversity of virulence factors during liver disease progression. Fecal secretory IgA and tumor necrosis factor-alpha in decompensated HBV cirrhotic patients were present at higher levels than in other groups, which indicates that a complicated autoregulatory system tries to achieve a new intestinal microecological balance.
TI  - Evaluation of three swab transport systems for the maintenance of clinically important bacteria in simulated mono- and polymicrobial samples.
AB  - In this study, three swab transport systems were evaluated: M40 Transystem, Amies broth with a relatively new type of swab (both Copan Diagnostics, Corona, CA, USA), and SSI transportmedium (Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen Denmark). The CLSI M40-A standard procedures and 11 culture collection strains were used. The transport systems were tested at room temperature for holding times of 0, 24, and 48 h, and both mono- and polymicrobial samples were included. After 24 h of simulated transportation, all systems were able to maintain the viability of all organisms tested. SSI transportmedium exhibited the lowest maintaining ability, whereas the two Copan systems were the most growth-promoting system. In polymicrobial samples, this latter feature was a problem. At 48 h, no transport system could maintain the viability of all strains, and the recovery rates differed depending on organism and device. The species most difficult to recover in all the three systems was Neisseria gonorrhoeae. When selecting a swab transport system, consideration must be given to the sample type, the conditions that prevail locally, and the performance in the clinical setting.
TI  - Synthesis of 2-mercaptobenzimidazole derivatives as potential anti-microbial and  cytotoxic agents.
AB  - A series of novel 2-(1H-benzimidazol-2-ylsulfanyl)-N-(4-oxo-2-phenyl-thiazolidin-3yl)-acetamide 5a-j have been synthesized from various aldehydes and 2-(5-phenyl-[1,3,4]-oxadiazol-2-ylmethylsulfanyl)-1H-benzimidazole 6a-j from various benzoic acids. These compounds were screened for their in-vitro anti-bacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis as Gram positive, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli as Gram negative bacterial strains and for in-vitro anti-fungal activity against Asperigillus fumigatus and Candida albicans. The in vitro cytotoxic properties were studied using brine shrimp bioassay. Results revealed that, compounds 5b, 5d, 5g, 5i, 6b, 6e, 6f, and 6i showed excellent activity against a panel of microorganisms. The cytotoxic activities of 5b, 5g, 5i, 6b, 6f, 6h, and 6i were found to be good. All the newly synthesized compounds were characterized by elemental analysis, IR, (1)H-NMR, (13)C-NMR and MS.
TI  - Macrophages from IBD patients exhibit defective tumour necrosis factor-alpha secretion but otherwise normal or augmented pro-inflammatory responses to infection.
AB  - Defects in macrophage function have been implicated in the establishment of Crohn's disease (CD). However, the response of macrophages from CD patients to live bacteria, particularly Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP), has not been addressed. Considering MAP has long been associated to CD, our objective was to assess whether macrophages from CD patients showed impaired inflammatory response to infection by MAP comparing to M. avium subsp. avium (MA) and other live intestinal commensal bacteria. Human peripheral blood monocyte-derived macrophages were obtained from CD patients, ulcerative colitis (UC) patients and controls. Following in vitro infection with MAP, MA, Escherichia coli or Enterococcus faecalis, cytokine levels and cell surface receptor expression were evaluated at different time points. Macrophages from CD patients showed impaired TNF-alpha secretion in response to bacterial challenge, but augmented IL-23 secretion and preserved IL-12 secretion and CD-40 expression. In addition, CD macrophages showed low IL-10 secretion. Macrophages from IBD patients showed increased expression of TLR-2 and -4, unaffected by infection. Differences in cytokine secretion observed after bacterial challenge were not MAP-specific, as other bacteria (E. coli and MA) showed similar effects. Macrophages from UC patients showed a less compromised TNF-alpha synthesis in response to mycobacterial infection than CD macrophages, with increased constitutive IL-12 secretion, and preserved IL-10 secretion. The increased IL-23 levels in response to infection and decreased IL-10 production observed in macrophages from CD patients may contribute to the inflammatory exacerbation observed in those patients.
TI  - Analysis of the bacterial heat shock response to photodynamic therapy-mediated oxidative stress.
AB  - Antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (PDT) has recently emerged as an effective modality for the selective destruction of bacteria and other pathogenic microorganisms. We investigated whether PDT induced protective responses such as heat shock proteins (HSPs) in bacteria. Using the photosensitizer Toluidine Blue O (TBO) at sublethal PDT conditions, a seven-fold increase in bacterial HSP GroEL and a three-fold increase in HSP DnaK were observed in Escherichia coli post PDT. Pretreatment with 50 degrees C heat for 30 min reduced PDT killing in both E. coli and in Enterococcus faecalis, with the most pronounced inhibition occurring at 50 mum TBO with 5 J cm(-2) 635 nm light, where E. coli killing was reduced by 2 log(10) and E. faecalis killing was reduced by 4 log(10). Finally, inhibition of the highly conserved chaperone DnaK using a small molecule benzylidene lactam HSP inhibitor potentiated (but not significantly) the effect of PDT at a TBO concentration of 2.5 mum in E. faecalis; however, this effect was not observed in E. coli presumably because inhibitor could not gain access due to Gram-negative permeability barrier. Induction of HSPs may be a mechanism whereby bacteria could become resistant to PDT and warrants the need for further study in the application of dual PDT-HSP-inhibition therapies.
TI  - Comparative genome-wide analysis of small RNAs of major Gram-positive pathogens:  from identification to application.
AB  - In the recent years, the number of drug- and multi-drug-resistant microbial strains has increased rapidly. Therefore, the need to identify innovative approaches for development of novel anti-infectives and new therapeutic targets is of high priority in global health care. The detection of small RNAs (sRNAs) in bacteria has attracted considerable attention as an emerging class of new gene expression regulators. Several experimental technologies to predict sRNA have been established for the Gram-negative model organism Escherichia coli. In many respects, sRNA screens in this model system have set a blueprint for the global and functional identification of sRNAs for Gram-positive microbes, but the functional role of sRNAs in colonization and pathogenicity for Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis and Clostridium difficile is almost completely unknown. Here, we report the current knowledge about the sRNAs of these socioeconomically relevant Gram-positive pathogens, overview the state-of-the-art high-throughput sRNA screening methods and summarize bioinformatics approaches for genome-wide sRNA identification and target prediction. Finally, we discuss the use of modified peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) as a novel tool to inactivate potential sRNA and their applications in rapid and specific detection of pathogenic bacteria.
TI  - A case with fistula formation between a perinephric retroperitoneal abscess and the duodenum: successful outcome after conservative management.
AB  - A 67-year-old woman diagnosed with pyonephrosis and perinephric abscess because of an impacted urinary stone in the pelvicoureteric junction was admitted to the hospital with a high-grade fever. Although construction of a right nephrostomy for drainage of the abscess improved her general condition, she had a fever again 2 weeks after the initial treatment. Computed tomography revealed a persistent perinephric retroperitoneal abscess and a second drainage procedure was performed. Then, imaging examination revealed fistula formation between the cavity of the perinephric retroperitoneal abscess and the duodenum. The patient received conservative management including percutaneous drainage, discontinuation of oral intake, and antimicrobial chemotherapy. Three days after the second drainage and discontinuation of oral intake, imaging examination revealed complete closure of the fistula. Fistula formation between a perinephric abscess and the duodenum is very rare but a favorable outcome was obtained by our conservative management.
TI  - Suprathel-antiseptic matrix: in vitro model for local antiseptic treatment?
AB  - Acetic acid is a traditional antiseptic agent that has been used for more than 6000 years. The main goal of this study was to demonstrate the suitability of Suprathel (PolyMedics Innovations GmbH, Denkendorf, Germany) in combination with various antiseptic agents to create an "antiseptic-matrix" especially designed for problematic microorganisms such as Proteus vulgaris, Acinetobacter baumannii, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which are frequently associated with burns. The study was designed to test the in vitro antimicrobial effect of a "Suprathel-antiseptic matrix" (Suprathel combined with acetic acid 3%, povidone-iodine 11% [Betaisodona], polyhexanide 0.04% [Lavasept], phenoxyethanol 2%/octenidine dihydrochloride 0.1% [Octenisept], mafenide acetate 5%, and chlorhexidine gluconate 1.5%/cetrimid 15% [Hibicet]). As a means to assess the typical bacterial spectrum of a burn unit, the following Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria strains were tested: Escherichia coli, P vulgaris, P aeruginosa, A baumannii, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S aureus, and beta-hemolytic streptococcus groups A and B. The tests showed a positive bactericidal effect of the Suprathel-antiseptic matrix, particularly with problematic Gram-negative bacteria such as P vulgaris, P aeruginosa, and A baumannii, except for the combination of Suprathel and mafenide acetate. It can be concluded that Suprathel-antiseptic matrix appears to be suitable as a local antiseptic agent, but clinical studies need to be performed to confirm these in vitro observations. The authors' previous studies have shown that acetic acid demonstrates a wide antiseptic spectrum for microorganisms typically found in burn patients. The combination of Suprathel and acetic acid worked well in this study and appears to be promising for future clinical application.
TI  - Nationwide survey of antibacterial activity against clinical isolates from urinary tract infections in Japan (2008).
AB  - In this study, the causative bacteria and their sensitivity to various antimicrobial agents as well as risk factors for quinolone-resistant Escherichia coli were investigated in patients with acute uncomplicated cystitis or complicated cystitis by isolation and culture of bacteria from urine samples. In total, 1312 strains were isolated from 1009 patients with acute uncomplicated cystitis, including E. coli (63.3%), Enterococcus faecalis (12.8%) and Streptococcus agalactiae (4.6%). In addition, 994 strains were isolated from 725 patients with complicated cystitis, including E. coli (36.4%), E. faecalis (19.2%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (5.0%), S. agalactiae (4.7%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4.5%). At least 90% of E. coli isolates from acute uncomplicated cystitis showed sensitivity to fluoroquinolones and cephems, whilst 70.4-88.4% of E. coli isolates from complicated cystitis were sensitive to fluoroquinolones and 85.4-89.5% were sensitive to cephems. Factors associated with quinolone-resistant E. coli included two or more episodes of cystitis within 1 year, failure of quinolone therapy, underlying urinary tract disease, prior quinolone treatment within 1 month and age >/= 75 years. It is important to confirm the sensitivity of causative bacteria for optimal antimicrobial therapy, and empirical antimicrobial agents should be selected by considering patient characteristics and other factors.
TI  - Carijodienone from the octocoral Carijoa multiflora. A spiropregnane-based steroid.
AB  - Two new steroids (1 and 2) and the known pregna-1,4,20-trien-3-one (3) have been  isolated from the Pacific octocoral Carijoa multiflora. Compound 1 possesses a novel spiropregnane-based steroidal skeleton. The photochemical transformation of 3 into 1 allowed the assignment of the absolute configuration at C-10 of 1. The antibacterial activities of compounds 1 and 3 were evaluated against a panel of bacterial strains.
TI  - Prevalence of hospital-acquired enterococci infections in two primary-care hospitals in osogbo, southwestern Nigeria.
AB  - Enterococci are opportunistic bacteria that become pathogenic when they colonize  niches where they are not normally found. Of recent, they have become major cause of nosocomial infections, especially of the bloodstream, urinary tract and surgical sites. The aim of this study is to determine the point-prevalence rate of human enterococci infections among hospitalized patients in Osogbo, Nigeria. The study was conducted between January and June 2009 in two primary-care hospitals in Osogbo and involved a total of 118 patients who developed clinical evidence of infection at least 48 hours after hospital admission. Appropriate clinical samples were collected from the patients after an informed consent and cultured for isolation/biochemical identification of Enterococcus species at the Bacteriology Laboratory of Ladoke Akintola University of Technology, Osogbo using standard microbiological methods. There were 525 hospital admissions within the time frame of the study of which 118 (22.5%) developed hospital acquired infection (HAI); 58 (49.2%) of which cultured positive for bacterial pathogens. Enterococci were isolated from infective focus in 7 patients, giving a prevalence rate of hospital-acquired enterococci infection of 5.9%. Two species of Enterococcus were identified; Enterococcus faecalis from urinary tract infection (UTI) and surgical site infection (SSI) of 6 (85.7%) patients and Enterococcus faecium from UTI in 1 (14.3%) patient. Other bacteria recovered from other infective foci were Klebsiella spp 31.0%, Pseudomonas spp 20.7%, Staphylococcus aureus 17.2%, Escherichia coli 12.1%, Staphylococcus epidermidis 3.4%, Streptococcus pneumoniae 1.7% and Serratia spp 1.7%. All the enterococci isolates were multiply antibiotic resistant, and 42.9% were vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) with the VRE strains showing resistance to wider range of antibiotics than the vancomycin-sensitive strains. Other Gram-positive and Gram negative bacterial isolates also demonstrated multiple resistance to all commonly available antibiotics in this community except E. coli and Pseudomonas spp which were relatively sensitive to ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime. This limited study demonstrated a high prevalence rate of multiple antibiotic resistant enterococci infections among hospitalized patients in this environment. There is need for systematic surveillance of hospitals for enterococci infections; prudent use and rational prescription of antibiotics and stringent measures to reduce the prevalence rate by health education on infection control measures such as isolation, cleaning, disinfection and sterilization.
TI  - [Chlorhexidine as a root canal irrigant--antimicrobial and scanning electron microscopic evaluation].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Selection of irrigant is very important for long-term success of root canal therapy. OBJECTIVE: This study was undertaken to evaluate the antimicrobial effects of 2% chlorhexidine digluconate solution (CHX) against five selected microorganisms and to evaluate its efficacy in root canal cleaning. METHODS: In this study, by agar diffusion test, were evaluated antimicrobial effects of three root canal irrigants: 5.25% NaOCl, 2.5% NaOCl and 2% CHX. The microorganisms tested in this study were Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli and Candida albicans. A scanning electron microscope was used to evaluate root canal cleaning ability of 5.25% NaOCl, 2.5% NaOCl, 2% CHX and 15% EDTA. Twelve extracted single-root human teeth were divided into four groups depending on the irrigant used during instrumentation. Mechanical preparation was performed with Step back technique and K files. Data were analysed statistically by Student's t-test. RESULTS: 5.25% NaOCl was the most effective against all tested microorganisms. 2.5% NaOCl and 2% CHX showed antimicrobial effects against all tested microorganisms but zones of inhibition were smaller.The best results in root canal walls cleaning were obtained in the group where the irrigant was 15% EDTA (score 2.33). In 5.25% NaOCl, 2.5% NaOCl and 2% CHX groups, there was more smear layer (score 4 and 5). CONCLUSION: 2% chlorhexidine digluconate showed strong antimicrobial effect on the tested microorganisms, but was not effective in cleaning root canal walls.
TI  - The nationwide study of bacterial pathogens associated with urinary tract infections conducted by the Japanese Society of Chemotherapy.
AB  - This study was conducted by the Japanese Society of Chemotherapy and is the first nationwide study on bacterial pathogens isolated from patients with urinary tract infections at 28 hospitals throughout Japan between January 2008 and June 2008. A total of 688 bacterial strains were isolated from adult patients with urinary tract infections. The strains investigated in this study are as follows: Enterococcus faecalis (n = 140), Escherichia coli (n = 255), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 93), Proteus mirabilis (n = 42), Serratia marcescens (n = 44), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 114). The minimum inhibitory concentrations of 39 antibacterial agents used for these strains were determined according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) manual. All Enterococcus faecalis strains were susceptible to ampicillin and vancomycin. Although a majority of the E. faecalis strains were susceptible to linezolid, 11 strains (7.8%) were found to be intermediately resistant. The proportions of fluoroquinolone-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and S. marcescens strains were 35.7%, 29.3%, 18.3%, and 15.2%, respectively. The proportions of E. coli, P. mirabilis, K. pneumoniae, and S. marcescens strains producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamase were 5.1%, 11.9%, 0%, and 0%, respectively. The proportions of Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains resistant to carbapenems, aminoglycosides, and fluoroquinolones were 9.2%, 4.4%, and 34.8%, respectively, and among them, 2 strains (1.8%) were found to be multidrug resistant. These data present important information for the proper treatment of urinary tract infections and will serve as a useful reference for periodic surveillance studies in the future.
TI  - Chitosan-cobalt(II) and nickel(II) chelates as antibacterial agents.
AB  - Antibacterial behavior of chitosan-bivalent metal chelates (Co and Ni) was investigated in vitro against standard bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 4533, S. faecalis ATCC 8043 and Escherichia coli ATCC 25923. The chitosan-metal chelates were prepared by varying the molar ratio of metal ions to a fixed amount of chitosan. The metal ion contents, structural properties and morphology of the chelates were respectively determined using ICP-OES, FT-IR and SEM. All the chitosan-metal chelates showed wide spectrum of effective antibacterial activities better than free chitosan and the individual metal ions. The results indicated that inhibitory effects of the chelates were dependent not only on the property of the coordinated metal ion, but also on the molar ratio of the metal ion. Consequently, the ideal inhibitory effects could be obtained with metal ion of high charge intensity and when the molar ratio of chitosan to metal was above 1:1. These chelates are promising materials for novel antibacterial agents.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance in community-acquired urinary tract infections: results  from the Korean Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System.
AB  - The Korean Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System was established and the first nationwide surveillance of bacterial uropathogens was conducted during the period from January 2008 to June 2009. With the cooperation of 34 medical centers throughout South Korea, a total of 1994 strains belonging to clinically relevant bacterial uropathogens were collected from patients with community-acquired urinary tract infections (UTIs). To compare with past data, understand a trend of antimicrobial resistance, and ultimately determine new regimens for empirical treatment of uncomplicated cystitis, the antimicrobial susceptibilities against Escherichia coli in uncomplicated cystitis to commonly prescribed drugs were investigated. In uncomplicated cystitis, the most prevalent causative organism was E. coli (72.7%), followed by Enterococcus faecalis (10.7%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (3.5%). Among E. coli isolates from acute uncomplicated cystitis, 38.5% were susceptible to ampicillin, 80.7% to amoxicillin/clavulanate, 67.3% to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, 74.6% to ciprofloxacin, 77.5% to levofloxacin, 86.0% to cefazolin, 86.1% to cefuroxime, 93.6% to cefpodoxime, 94.7% to ceftriaxone, 99.5% to amikacin, 80.9% to tobramycin, and 76.6% to gentamicin. An increasing tendency of resistance to ciprofloxacin (24.8%) has been observed compared with the similar studies in 2006 (23.4%) and 2002 (15.2%) from patients with uncomplicated cystitis. These data provide much needed information on the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in community-acquired UTIs in South Korea and will be a useful reference for future periodic surveillance studies.
TI  - Ceftaroline activity against pathogens associated with complicated skin and skin  structure infections: results from an international surveillance study.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the spectrum and potency of ceftaroline, a novel anti-methicillin-resistant staphylococcal cephalosporin, against a 2008 surveillance collection of clinical isolates from patients in the USA and Europe. METHODS: A collection of 14 169 isolates of various bacterial species from complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSIs) was tested for susceptibility to ceftaroline and 19 comparator agents in a central reference laboratory using CLSI broth microdilution methods. Organisms were received from 55 medical centres; 27 in the USA and 28 in Europe (12 countries, including Israel). The clonality of isolates of Staphylococcus aureus with elevated ceftaroline MICs (4 mg/L) was determined by PFGE and single and multilocus sequence typing, and the mechanism of ceftaroline non-susceptibility was assessed by molecular methods (PCR amplification and sequencing). RESULTS: Ceftaroline, the active component of the parenteral prodrug ceftaroline fosamil, was active against 2988 methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) isolates, with an MI(9)(0) of 1 mg/L. The MIC(9)(0) for methicillin-susceptible strains was 0.25-0.5 mg/L. Ceftaroline was additionally active against coagulase-negative staphylococci (MIC(9)(0), 0.5-1 mg/L), Enterococcus faecalis (MIC(5)(0), 2 mg/L), beta-haemolytic and viridans group streptococci (MIC(9)(0), 0.015-0.25 mg/L) and three commonly isolated Enterobacteriaceae (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp. and Proteus mirabilis; MIC(9)(0) values of 0.25 to > 16 mg/L). All but four isolates of MRSA (0.13%) had ceftaroline MIC values of </= 2 mg/L. The isolates for which ceftaroline MICs were 4 mg/L were clonal (single Greek hospital) and had detectable mecA mutations (N146K, N204K, E150K and H351N). CONCLUSIONS: The ceftaroline yearly (2008) surveillance for the USA and Europe documented low MIC(5)(0)/(9)(0) values for MRSA isolates at 1/1 and 1/2 mg/L, respectively. Ceftaroline demonstrated promising potency and coverage against Gram-positive and -negative pathogens known to cause cSSSIs, including MRSA and beta-haemolytic streptococci.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance of Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis in housed  laying-hen flocks in Europe.
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the potential association between housing  type and multiple drug resistance (MDR) in Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis isolates recovered from 283 laying-hen flocks. In each flock, a cloacal swab from four hens was collected and produced 1102 E. coli and 792 E. faecalis isolates. Broth microdilution was used to test susceptibility to antimicrobials. Country and housing type interacted differently with the MDR levels of both species. In the E. coli model, housing in a raised-floor system was associated with an increased risk of MDR compared to the conventional battery system [odds ratio (OR) 2.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.13-3.97)]. In the E. faecalis model the MDR levels were lower in free-range systems than in conventional battery cages (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.27-0.94). In Belgium, ceftiofur-resistant E. coli isolates were more numerous than in the other countries.
TI  - Expression of linear permutated variants from circular enterocin AS-48.
AB  - To confirm whether the head-to-tail circularization could be involved in the stability and activity of the circular bacteriocin AS-48, two permutated linear structural as-48A genes have been constructed by circular permutation. The absence of the leaderless linear AS(23/24) and AS(48/49) proteins in Escherichia coli, under all the conditions investigated, supports the idea that the circular backbone is important to stabilize their structure and also indicates the significance of a leader peptide. In fact, the approach taken in this study to generate linear permutated proteins fused to an appropriate partner was sufficient to prevent cellular proteolysis. In this case, the high expression levels found favour their intracellular accumulations as inclusion bodies, which after solubilization showed a propensity to aggregate, thus hindering the specific EK cleavage. This could explain the presence of active hybrid tagged proteins identified in this work. The conserved distribution of hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces in the hybrid proteins is responsible for the antibacterial activity. In addition, the opening of the AS-48 molecule between the residues G(23) W(24) connecting the alpha1/alpha2 helices, confers greater stability, suggesting that the sequence and/or the free amino acid in the polypeptide chain are critical aspects in the design of new variants.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of E-101 Solution, a novel myeloperoxidase-mediated antimicrobial, against Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: E-101 Solution (E-101) is a novel myeloperoxidase-mediated antimicrobial. It is composed of porcine myeloperoxidase (pMPO), glucose oxidase, glucose as the substrate and specific amino acids in an aqueous vehicle. E-101 is being developed for topical application directly into surgical wounds to prevent surgical site infections (SSIs). The in vitro activity of E-101 was investigated. METHODS: MIC, MBC, time-kill and antimicrobial combination experiments were performed according to CLSI guidelines with modifications. Resistance selection studies were performed using a serial passage method. RESULTS: E-101 showed MIC(90) values of 0.03, 0.5 and 0.5 mg pMPO/L for staphylococci (n = 140), streptococci (n = 95) and enterococci (n = 55), respectively. MIC(90) values ranged between 0.03-0.5 and </= 0.004-0.12 mg pMPO/L for Enterobacteriaceae (n = 148) and Gram-negative non-Enterobacteriaceae (n = 92) strains, respectively. There was no antimicrobial tolerance to E-101 for Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae or Streptococcus pyogenes. Time-kill studies demonstrated a rapid (<30 min) bactericidal effect against S. aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in a concentration-dependent and time-dependent manner. There was no evidence of stable resistance to E-101 among staphylococci, enterococci, E. coli or P. aeruginosa strains and no evidence of E-101 interaction with antibiotics commonly used in clinical medicine. Conclusions E-101 shows potent and broad-spectrum in vitro activity against bacteria that are the causative pathogens of SSIs, thereby providing the impetus to test its clinical utility in the prevention of SSIs.
TI  - Co(III), Ni(II), Zn(II) and Cd(II) complexes with 2-acetyl-2-thiazoline thiosemicarbazone: Synthesis, characterization, X-ray structures and antibacterial activity.
AB  - The new ligand 2-acetyl-2-thiazoline thiosemicarbazone (HATtsc) and the complexes [Co(ATtsc)(2)](2)[CoCl(4)].2H(2)O (1), [Co(ATtsc)(2)]NO(3).H(2)O (2), [Ni(HATtsc)(2)](NO(3))(2) (3), [ZnCl(2)(HATtsc)].CH(3)CN (4), [{CdCl(HATtsc)}(2)(mu-Cl)(2)].2H(2)O (5) and [{Cd(NO(3))(HATtsc)}(2)(mu-NO(3))(2)] (6) were isolated and characterized by a variety of physico-chemical techniques and X-ray diffraction. The structure of HATtsc in 1 and 2 presented a thiolate form while in 3-6 the thione form was present, as it was in free ligand. In addition, we studied the antibacterial activity of the ligand and complexes 2-6 against some representative bacteria. Cd(II) complexes were more active against Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis than organic ligand. Conversely, Cd(II) compounds seemed to interfere in the cell separation of B. subtilis.
TI  - Functional cationic nanomagnet-porphyrin hybrids for the photoinactivation of microorganisms.
AB  - Cationic nanomagnet-porphyrin hybrids were synthesized and their photodynamic therapy capabilities were investigated against the Gram (-) Escherichia coli bacteria, the Gram (+) Enterococcus faecalis bacteria and T4-like phage. The synthesis, structural characterization, photophysical properties, and antimicrobial activity of these new materials are discussed. The results show that these new multicharged nanomagnet-porphyrin hybrids are very stable in water and highly effective in the photoinactivation of bacteria and phages. Their remarkable antimicrobial activity, associated with their easy recovery, just by applying a magnetic field, makes these materials novel photosensitizers for water or wastewater disinfection.
TI  - Tangential-flow ultrafiltration with integrated inhibition detection for recovery of surrogates and human pathogens from large-volume source water and finished drinking water.
AB  - Tangential-flow ultrafiltration was optimized for the recovery of Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Clostridium perfringens spores, bacteriophages MS2 and PRD1, murine norovirus, and poliovirus seeded into 100-liter surface water (SW) and drinking water (DW) samples. SW and DW collected from two drinking water treatment plants were then evaluated for human enteric viruses.
TI  - Inhibition of efflux pumps in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis resistant strains by triterpenoids from Momordica balsamina.
AB  - Six cucurbitane-type triterpenoids (1-6) isolated from the aerial parts of Momordica balsamina were evaluated for their ability to inhibit the activity of bacterial efflux pumps of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) COL(OXA), Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Salmonella enterica subsp. I serovar Typhimurium 5408 and S. Typhimurium 5408CIP strains. The latter strain overproduces the AcrB transporter of the AcrAB-TolC efflux pump six-fold compared with its parent. Compounds 4-6 were also tested for similar activity against Escherichia coli AG100 wild-type strain and E. coli AG100TET8 that overproduces the AcrAB-TolC efflux pump. Evaluation of efflux activity was performed using a semi-automated method that measures accumulation of the universal efflux pump substrate ethidium bromide (EtBr). Some of the compounds significantly inhibited efflux of EtBr by MRSA COL(OXA) and E. faecalis ATCC 29212. A correlation between activity and the topological polar surface area of the compounds was found for MRSA COL(OXA).
TI  - [Antimicrobial potential of Metarhizium taii in vitro].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the antimicrobial potential of Metarhizium tail and its corresponding active fractions. METHODS: The agar diffusion method and growth-rate assay were employed individually to measure the antibacterial and antifungal activities of M. taii. The microdilution and disk colony count was used to test the minimal inhibitory concentration and minimal bacterial concentration. RESULTS: The extraction fractions of M. tail could evidently inhibi the growth of Gram positive bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Gram negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aerzginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterococcus faecalis,and phytopathogenic fungi such as Rhizoctonia solani, Fusarium oxysporum, hereby M. taii had a broad spectrum antimicrobial effect including potent antibacterial and antifungal activities. The antimicrobial active ingredients of M. tail mainly existed in three extraction fractions including ethyl acetate extract in fermented broth, chloroform, and ethyl acetate extracts in mycelia. However there was an evident discrepancy on the antibacterial spectrum and competence for different active extraction fractions. CONCLUSION: M. taii possess potent and broad-spectrum antimicrobial potential, and it is a good edible and medicinal resource for the functional food development and the discovery of new antimicrobial drug.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance in Swiss laying hens, prevalence and risk factors.
AB  - Antimicrobial resistance is an emerging concern to public health, and food-producing animals are known to be a potential source for transmission of resistant bacteria to humans. As legislation of the European Union requires to ban conventional cages for the housing of laying hens on the one hand, and a high food safety standard for eggs on the other hand, further investigations about the occurrence of antimicrobial resistance in alternative housing types are required. In this study, we determined antimicrobial resistance in indicator bacteria from 396 cloacal swabs from 99 Swiss laying hen farms among four alternative housing types during a cross-sectional study. On each farm, four hens were sampled and exposure to potential risk factors was identified with a questionnaire. The minimal inhibitory concentration was determined using broth microdilution in Escherichia coli (n=371) for 18 antimicrobials and in Enterococcus faecalis (n=138) and Enterococcus faecium (n=153) for 16 antimicrobials. All antimicrobial classes recommended by the European Food Safety Authority for E. coli and enterococci were included in the resistance profile. Sixty per cent of the E. coli isolates were susceptible to all of the considered antimicrobials and 30% were resistant to at least two antimicrobials. In E. faecalis, 33% of the strains were susceptible to all tested antimicrobials and 40% were resistant to two or more antimicrobials, whereas in E. faecium these figures were 14% and 39% respectively. Risk factor analyses were carried out for bacteria species and antimicrobials with a prevalence of resistance between 15% and 85%. In these analyses, none of the considered housing and management factors showed a consistent association with the prevalence of resistance for more than two combinations of bacteria and antimicrobial. Therefore we conclude that the impact of the considered housing and management practices on the egg producing farms on resistance in laying hens is low.
TI  - Silver or nitrofurazone impregnation of urinary catheters has a minimal effect on uropathogen adherence.
AB  - PURPOSE: Bacterial adherence to the urinary catheter is an early step in biofilm  formation and the pathogenesis of catheter associated urinary tract infection. We studied in vitro the effect of silver or nitrofurazone impregnation of urinary catheters on uropathogen ability to adhere to urinary catheters. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied commercially available nitrofurazone-silicone, silicone only, silver-silicone-hydrogel, silicone-hydrogel, silver-latex-hydrogel and latex-hydrogel catheters. Catheters were incubated in sterile broth for 0, 3, 5, 7 and 10 days, respectively, before inoculation and overnight incubation with Escherichia coli or Enterococcus faecalis. RESULTS: Adherence of E. coli and E. faecalis to nitrofurazone catheters was significantly decreased compared to that of silicone-only catheters when catheters were fresh. The anti-adherence effect of nitrofurazone on E. coli decreased with time but was still significant at 5 days. For E. faecalis the effect of nitrofurazone was lost by 3 days of pre-incubation. E. coli adherence was not significantly decreased on silver impregnated catheters compared to that on control catheters of the same base material. Silver was associated with a significant decrease in E. faecalis adherence to latex-hydrogel catheters but not to silicone-hydrogel catheters. The adherence of each species to silicone catheters with hydrogel was significantly lower than that to silicone-only control catheters. CONCLUSIONS: Silver impregnation had little effect on bacterial adherence in our model and nitrofurazone impregnation had a significant effect only for the first 5 days. Our results do not support a role for silver urinary catheters to prevent catheter associated urinary tract infection by decreasing bacterial adherence.
TI  - Myeloperoxidase selectively binds and selectively kills microbes.
AB  - Myeloperoxidase (MPO) is reported to selectively bind to bacteria. The present study provides direct evidence of MPO binding selectivity and tests the relationship of selective binding to selective killing. The microbicidal effectiveness of H(2)O(2) and of OCl(-) was compared to that of MPO plus H(2)O(2). Synergistic microbicidal action was investigated by combining Streptococcus sanguinis, a H(2)O(2)-producing microbe showing low MPO binding, with high-MPO-binding Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa without exogenous H(2)O(2), with and without MPO, and with and without erythrocytes (red blood cells [RBCs]). Selectivity of MPO microbicidal action was conventionally measured as the MPO MIC and minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) for 82 bacteria including E. coli, P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and viridans streptococci. Both H(2)O(2) and OCl(-) destroyed RBCs at submicrobicidal concentrations. Nanomolar concentrations of MPO increased H(2)O(2) microbicidal action 1,000-fold. Streptococci plus MPO produced potent synergistic microbicidal action against all microbes tested, and RBCs caused only a small decrease in potency without erythrocyte damage. MPO directly killed H(2)O(2)-producing S. pyogenes but was ineffective against non-H(2)O(2)-producing E. faecalis. The MPO MICs and MBCs for E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and S. aureus were significantly lower than those for E. faecalis. The streptococcal studies showed much higher MIC/MBC results, but such testing required lysed horse blood-supplemented medium, thus preventing valid comparison of these results to those for the other microbes. E. faecalis MPO binding is reportedly weak compared to binding of E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and S. aureus but strong compared to binding of streptococci. Selective MPO binding results in selective killing.
TI  - Chitosan-EDTA new combination is a promising candidate for treatment of bacterial and fungal infections.
AB  - Chitosan is an attractive preparation widely used as a pharmaceutical excipient.  This study aimed to evaluate the antimicrobial activities of chitosan derivatives, EDTA, and the newly developed chitosan-EDTA combination against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria as well as Candida albicans. Antimicrobial activity was studied. Both minimal Inhibitory Concentrations (MIC) and minimal biocidal concentrations (MBC) were determined. Chitosan acetic acid recorded lower MIC values against Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Candida albicans than those exhibited by EDTA. EDTA failed to have inhibitory activity against Enterococcus faecalis as well as MBC against any of the studied microorganisms. Chitosan acetic acid's MBC were recorded to all examined species. Checkerboard assay results indicated a synergistic antimicrobial activity of the new combination against Staphylococcus aureus and an additive effect against other microorganisms. Moreover, a short microbial exposure to chitosan-EDTA (20-30 min) caused complete eradication. Due to the continuous emergence of resistant strains, there is an urgent need to discover new antimicrobial agents. Our findings suggest the use of chitosan as an enhancing agent with antibacterial and antifungal properties in combination with EDTA in pharmaceutical preparations.
TI  - Elaboration of antibiofilm materials by chemical grafting of an antimicrobial peptide.
AB  - A peptide antibiotic, gramicidin A, was covalently bound to cystamine self-assembled monolayers on gold surfaces. Each step of the surface functionalization was characterized by polarization modulation infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The antimicrobial activity of the anchored gramicidin was tested against three Gram-positive bacteria (Listeria ivanovii, Enterococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus aureus), the Gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli and the yeast Candida albicans. The results revealed that the adsorbed gramicidin reduced, from 60% for E. coli to 90% for C. albicans, the number of culturable microorganisms attached to the surface. The activity was proven to be persistent overtime, up to 6 months after the first use. The bacteria attached to the functionalized surfaces were permeabilized as shown by confocal microscopy. Taken together, these results indicate a bacteriostatic mode of action of the immobilized peptide. Finally, using green fluorescent protein-expressing bacteria, it was shown that the development of a bacterial biofilm was delayed on peptide-grafted surfaces for at least 24 h.
TI  - Synergy of nitric oxide and silver sulfadiazine against gram-negative, gram-positive, and antibiotic-resistant pathogens.
AB  - The synergistic activity between nitric oxide (NO) released from diazeniumdiolate-modified proline (PROLI/NO) and silver(I) sulfadiazine (AgSD) was evaluated against Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis using a modified broth microdilution technique and a checkerboard-type assay. The combination of NO and AgSD was defined as synergistic when the fractional bactericidal concentration (FBC) was calculated to be <0.5. Gram-negative species were generally more susceptible to the individual antimicrobial agents than the Gram-positive bacteria, while Gram-positive bacteria were more susceptible to combination therapy. The in vitro synergistic activity of AgSD and NO observed against a range of pathogens strongly supports future investigation of this therapeutic combination, particularly for its potential use in the treatment of burns and chronic wounds.
TI  - Structural and biochemical analysis of the pentapeptide repeat protein EfsQnr, a  potent DNA gyrase inhibitor.
AB  - The chromosomally encoded Qnr homolog protein from Enterococcus faecalis (EfsQnr), when expressed, confers to its host a decreased susceptibility to quinolones and consists mainly of tandem repeats, which is consistent with belonging to the pentapeptide repeat family of proteins (PRPs). EfsQnr was cloned with an N-terminal 6x His tag and purified to homogeneity. EfsQnr partially protected DNA gyrase from fluoroquinolone inhibition at concentrations as low as 20 nM. EfsQnr inhibited the ATP-dependent supercoiling activity of DNA gyrase with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) of 1.2 muM, while no significant inhibition of ATP-independent relaxation activity was observed. EfsQnr was cytotoxic when overexpressed in Escherichia coli, resulting in the clumping of cells and a loss of viability. The X-ray crystal structure of EfsQnr was determined to 1.6-A resolution. EfsQnr exhibits the right-handed quadrilateral beta-helical fold typical of PRPs, with features more analogous to MfpA (mycobacterium fluoroquinolone resistance pentapeptide) than to the PRPs commonly found in cyanobacteria.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of extracts from Tamarindus indica L. leaves.
AB  - Tamarindus indica L. leaves are reported worldwide as antibacterial and antifungal agents; however, this observation is not completely accurate in the case of Cuba. In this article, decoctions from fresh and sun dried leaves, as well as fluid extracts prepared with 30 and 70% ethanol-water and the pure essential oil from tamarind leaves were microbiologically tested against Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Pseudomona aeruginosa and Candida albicans. Aqueous and fluid extracts were previously characterized by spectrophotometric determination of their total phenols and flavonoids, while the essential oil was chemically evaluated by gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy (GC/MS). Experimental data suggest phenols as active compounds against B. subtilis cultures, but not against other microorganisms. On the other hand, the essential oil exhibited a good antimicrobial spectrum when pure, but its relative low concentrations in common folk preparations do not allow for any good activity in these extracts.
TI  - Effects of Enterococcus faecium supplementation and floor type on performance, morphology of erythrocytes and intestinal microbiota in broiler chickens.
AB  - 1. The experiment was to study the effects of floor type and probiotic supplementation (Enterococcus faecium) on performance, morphology of erythrocytes and intestinal microbiota of male Ross 308 broiler chickens. 2. The experimental design was a factorial 2 x 2 with 6 replicates. The factors were floor type (wire floor versus wood shaving litter) and the presence or absence of probiotic. 3. Birds housed on wood shavings exhibited significantly improved weight gain and food intake. 4. Addition of E. faecium led to significantly decreased food intake and gizzard weight. Supplementation with E. faecium positively influenced the ileal and caecal microbiota, with a significant decrease in the population of Escherichia coli. 5. Erythrocyte length decreased and erythrocyte width increased in the birds housed on wood shavings.
TI  - Antimicrobial activities of single aroma compounds.
AB  - Commercially available aroma samples were evaluated for their olfactory quality by professional perfumers and tested for their antimicrobial activity. Agar diffusion and agar-dilution were used as test methods and a set of two Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis) and four Gram-negative bacterial strains (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus vulgaris G, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Salmonella abony) and a yeast, Candida albicans, were the test microorganisms. All the investigated compounds were active against Gram-positive bacteria, especially beta-caryophyllene against Enterococcus faecalis (MIC 6 ppm), but only few substances showed activity towards Gram-negative bacteria, except for cinnamic acid, which was active against all (MIC 60 ppm) and Candida albicans, against which cinnamic acid and caryophyllene oxide showed high activity (MIC < 60 ppm).
TI  - [Etiology and sensitivity of uropathogens identified in uncomplicated lower urinary tract infections in women (ARESC Study): implications on empiric therapy].
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: To determine the etiology and susceptibility of uropathogens identified in women with uncomplicated lower urinary tract infections (UTI). PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a multicenter study (ARESC) in 9 Spanish hospitals, 803 female patients with uncomplicated cystitis were consecutively enrolled and evaluated to identify the uropathogens and their susceptibility to 9 antimicrobials. RESULTS: Of 803 patients with uncomplicated cystitis, 784 patients were included. A positive urine culture was found in 87.7% of the samples. Of the 650 pathogens isolated, Escherichia coli (E. coli) was the most frequent (79.2%) followed by Staphylococcus saprophyticus (4.4%), Proteus mirabilis (4.3%), Enterococcus faecalis (3.2%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (2.3%). E. coli showed a high rate of susceptibility to phosphomycin (97.2%), nitrofurantoin (94.1%) and somewhat lower to ciprofloxacin (88.1%). Fluorquinolone resistance rates were higher among postmenopausal women (17 versus 10%). E. coli was highly resistant to ampicillin (65%) and cotrimoxazole (34%) and 25% of the strains were resistant to amoxicillin/clavulanalic acid and cefuroxime. CONCLUSIONS: In Spain, E. coli shows high resistance rates to widely used antimicrobial antibiotics. Phosphomycin and nitrofurantoin have a high in vitro activity. Taking into account practical aspects such as convenience (only one dose), and the influence of the amount of fluorquinolone use on enterobacteriaceae and other microorganisms resistance levels, phosphomycin trometamol represents the option of first choice for the empirical treatment of uncomplicated cystitis in women.
TI  - Leaves Antimicrobial Activity of Glycyrrhiza glabra L.
AB  - Licorice (Glycyrrhiza glabra L.) is an important medicinal plant. In this study,  the antimicrobial activities of ethanolic and aqueous extracts from licorice leaves were studied compared to root extracts activities. Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli, and Candida albicans were used as test organisms. Antimicrobial activity was tested by paper disc agar diffusion and serial dilution methods in order to determine minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC). The root and leave extracts showed activity against Candida albicans, and tested gram-positive bacteria in a dose dependent manner. The ethanolic extract of the leaves was the most active extract against gram-positive bacteria. Its effectiveness against strains provides hope that it can serve as an alternative therapeutic agent.
TI  - The bacteriological analysis and health risks in the urban estuary of St. George's Bay, Grenada, West Indies.
AB  - The dilution rates of indicators Enterococcus faecalis and E. coli were studied from the St. John's River estuary in Grenada, West Indies. Health risk zones were established based on the levels of bacteriological pollution. In accordance with the World Health Organization (WHO) health risk guidelines, risks were in the range of <1% gastrointestinal (GI); <0.3% acute febrile respiratory illness (AFRI) to a 1%-5% GI; and 0.9%-1.9% AFRI within 100 m from the St. John's River outflow site in St. George's Bay. These values were the result of river water dilution, where the most probable number (MPN) levels for both indicator organisms from the river were equivalent to that of raw sewage with an AFRI health risk of >3.9% and a GI risk of >10%. The distance intervals farther than 100 m showed fluctuating values and corresponding health risks. E. faecalis and E. coli strains isolated were resistant to 35.7% and 42.9% of the antibiotics tested, respectively.
TI  - Removal of Escherichia coli, Enterococcus fecalis, coliphage MS2, poliovirus, and hepatitis A virus from oysters (Crassostrea virginica) and hard shell clams (Mercinaria mercinaria) by depuration.
AB  - Filter-feeding bivalve mollusks (shellfish) can bioaccumulate pathogenic microorganisms in up to 1000-fold higher levels than overlying waters, and therefore disease risks are associated with consuming raw or partially cooked shellfish. Many of these shellfish-borne diseases are due to enteric bacteria and viruses associated with fecal contamination. To control shellfish-borne diseases, guidelines for shellfish harvest waters and shellfish meat have been devised, which include cleansing of contaminated shellfish by depuration in controlled systems, heat pasteurization, or relay to clean waters. This study examines the depuration of oysters (Crassostrea virginica) and hard shell clams (Mercinaria mercinaria) in a flow-through depuration system under variable temperature (12 degrees C, 18 degrees C, and 25 degrees C), salinity (8 ppt, 18 ppt, and 28 ppt), turbidity (<1NTU, 10NTU, and 20NTU), pH (pH 7 and pH 8), and algae conditions (0 cells/mL and 50,000 cells/mL), with constant dissolved oxygen (5-7 mg/L). Oysters and hard shell clams were artificially contaminated with enteric microorganisms: Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, coliphage MS2, Poliovirus type-1 and Hepatitis A virus HM-175 (HAV), then depurated in 5-day trials with daily sampling. In oysters, optimizing environmental parameters of water temperature improved E. coli, MS2, poliovirus and HAV depuration, and optimized salinity improved E. coli, E. faecalis, and MS2 depuration rates. In hard shell clams, salinity improved E. coli and E. faecalis depuration rates. Adjusting turbidity, pH or algae did not improve microorganism depuration in either oysters or hard shell clams, with the exception of turbidity on E. faecalis in hard shell clams. Microorganism depuration rates in oysters from greatest to least were: MS2>E. coli>E. faecalis>poliovirus>HAV, and in clams depuration rates from greatest to least were: E. coli>E. faecalis>HAV>MS2>poliovirus. Because E. coli and E. faecalis were removed at faster rates than HAV and poliovirus, these fecal bacteria appear to be poor process indicators of the virological quality of depurated oysters and hard shell clams.
TI  - In vivo antibacterial activity of nemonoxacin, a novel non-fluorinated quinolone.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the in vivo antibacterial efficacy of nemonoxacin, a novel C8-methoxy non-fluorinated quinolone in murine systemic and local infection models. METHODS: The efficacy of nemonoxacin in systemic infections was evaluated in mouse peritonitis models using isolates of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA, n=1), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA, n=1), methicillin- and levofloxacin-resistant Staphylococcus capitis (levofloxacin-resistant MRSC, n=1), penicillin-intermediate Streptococcus pneumoniae (PISP, n=1), penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP, n=2), Enterococcus faecalis (n=2, including 1 vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus, VRE) and Escherichia coli (n=3). The local infections included mouse pulmonary infections caused by PRSP (n=1), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=1) and mouse ascending urinary tract infection caused by E. coli (n=1). RESULTS: In the mouse systemic infection model, nemonoxacin demonstrated potent activity against MSSA (ED(50) =2.08 mg/kg), MRSA (ED(50) =2.59 mg/kg), levofloxacin-resistant MRSC (ED(50) =2.52 mg/kg), PISP (ED(50) =5.47 mg/kg), PRSP (ED(50) =3.68-5.28 mg/kg) and E. coli (ED(50) =3.13-5.28 mg/kg), and moderate activity towards E. faecalis infection (ED(50) =8.48-15.16 mg/kg). The therapeutic efficacy of nemonoxacin was significantly higher (P<0.01) than that of levofloxacin in infections caused by Gram-positive isolates (MSSA, MRSA, levofloxacin-resistant MRSC, PISP, PRSP and E. faecalis), but less potent than that of levofloxacin against E. coli infection (P<0.01). Nemonoxacin in vivo efficacy results with Gram-positive isolates (2- to 5-fold ED(50) advantage over levofloxacin) are consistent with the MIC data (4- to 16-fold MIC advantage of nemonoxacin over levofloxacin). In the mouse pulmonary infection model, nemonoxacin showed potent activity towards PRSP (higher than levofloxacin) and K. pneumoniae (lower than levofloxacin) infections. In the mouse ascending urinary tract infection model, nemonoxacin exhibited potent activity against E. coli infection (lower than levofloxacin). CONCLUSIONS: The results validated the potent efficacy of nemonoxacin in vivo. The higher efficacy of nemonoxacin than of levofloxacin towards infections caused by Gram-positive cocci (especially MRSA, levofloxacin-resistant MRSC, PRSP and VRE) warrants investigation of its clinical use.
TI  - Empirical first-line treatment with tigecycline for febrile episodes following abdominal surgery in cancer patients.
AB  - Cancer patients with complicated infections following abdominal surgery represent one of the worst clinical scenarios that is useful for testing the efficacy of empirical antimicrobial therapy. No study so far has evaluated the performance of tigecycline (TIG) when administered as empirical first-line treatment in a homogeneous population of surgical cancer patients with a febrile episode. An observational review of the data records of 24 sequential patients receiving TIG for a febrile episode following a major abdominal procedure in a single cancer institute was performed. Large bowel surgery represented 68% of all procedures, followed by gastric surgery (16%) and urinary-gynaecologic-biliary surgery (16%). Complications following surgery were observed in 68% of febrile episodes, with peritonitis and sepsis accounting for 59% and 24% of complications, respectively. Eight patients needed repeat surgery for source control. The mean duration of TIG treatment was 8 days. Causative pathogens were detected in 16 episodes (64%), and a total of 44 microorganisms were recovered (29% Escherichia coli, 9% Enterococcus faecalis and 9% coagulase-negative staphylococci). TIG was effective in 12 episodes (48%). The success rate was 67% when infectious episodes sustained by intrinsically resistant bacteria and fungi were excluded. Treatment failure was associated with the presence of complications and with microbiologically documented infection. TIG may be useful as a first-line treatment option in cancer patients requiring antibiotic treatment following surgery when complications are not present or suspected on clinical grounds and when local microbial epidemiology shows a low incidence of primary resistant bacteria.
TI  - X-ray crystal structure of the DNA-binding domain of response regulator WalR essential to the cell viability of staphylococcus aureus and interaction with target DNA.
AB  - A bacterial two-component signal transduction system, WalK/WalR, is essential to  the cell viability of Gram-positive bacteria and is therefore a potential target for the development of a new class of antibiotics. We have solved the X-ray crystal structure of the DNA-binding domain of the response regulator WalR (WalRc) from a Gram-positive pathogen Staphylococcus aureus, currently causing serious problems in public health through the acquisition of multi-drug resistance. The structure contains a winged helix-turn-helix motif and closely resembles those of WalRs of Bacillus subtilis and Enterococcus faecalis, and also that of PhoB of Escherichia coli. Gel mobility shift assays with mutant WalRs revealed specific interactions of WalR with the target DNA, as elaborated by in silico modeling of the WalRc-DNA complex.
TI  - Photokilling of bacteria by curcumin in selected polyethylene glycol 400 (PEG 400) preparations. Studies on curcumin and curcuminoids, XLI.
AB  - Curcumin, bis(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-1,6-heptadiene-3,5-dione, is a yellow-orange pigment which can be synthesised chemically or isolated from the plant Curcuma longa L. Curcumin has a rather broad absorption peak in the range 300-500 nm (maximum approximately 430 nm) and has potential as a photosensitiser for treatment of localised superficial infections in e.g., the mouth or skin. Previously, we have demonstrated phototoxic effects of curcumin in selected aqueous preparations against both gram-positive Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus intermedius and gram-negative Escherichia coil bacteria in vitro. One of the most efficient preparations was curcumin in polyethylene glycol (PEG 400) dissolved in phosphate buffered saline (PBS), pH 6.1. In this study the solubilising effect of PEG 400 on curcumin molecules and the in vitro phototoxic effects of these preparations were further evaluated. The effect of varying the curcumin concentration (2.50 microM -25.00 microM), the radiant exposure (0.5-30 J/cm2) and the physical state of curcumin against the survival of E. coli was investigated. PEG 400 showed an increasing physically stabilising effect towards crystallisation of curcumin in aqueous preparation with increasing concentrations (2.5%-10.0% v/v). Despite a higher solubility of curcumin with increasing PEG 400 concentrations, the surfactant reduced the phototoxicity of curcumin against E. coil. The highest phototoxic effect was obtained when curcumin was present in the least physically stable preparation, a stock solution in ethanol added to PBS with or without the lowest test concentration of PEG 400 (2.5% v/v). The obtained phototoxic effect can be increased by increasing the irradiation dose or by choosing an optimal curcumin concentration. E. faecalis was efficiently killed by the lowest concentration of curcumin in combination with the lowest radiant exposure when curcumin was dissolved in certain PEG solutions (< 0.02% survival), but showed no reduction when exposed to preirradiated curcumin.
TI  - Bacterial contamination of stethoscopes used by health workers: public health implications.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study was designed to assess both the potential for bacterial transmission by stethoscopes used by health-care workers in Nigeria and the implications for patient safety and control of hospital-acquired infections. METHODOLOGY: A structured questionnaire was administered to health workers and the surface of the diaphragm of their stethoscopes swabbed for bacteriological analysis using standard techniques. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Of the 107 stethoscopes surveyed, 84 (79%) were contaminated with bacteria; 59 (81%) of the contaminated stethoscopes belonged to physicians and 25 (74%) were from other health workers. Isolates included Staphylococcus aureus (54%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (19%), Enterococcus faecalis (14%), and Escherichia coli (13%). All stethoscopes that had never been cleaned were contaminated while lower levels of contamination were found on those cleaned one week or less before the survey (chi(2) = 22.4, P < .05). Contamination was significantly higher on stethoscopes cleaned with only water (100%) compared to those cleaned with alcohol (49%) (chi(2) = 30.17, P < .05). Significantly fewer (9%) stethoscopes from health workers who washed their hands after seeing each patient were contaminated when compared with the instruments (86%) of those who did not practice hand washing (chi(2) = 23.79, P < .05). E. coli showed the highest antibiotic resistance, while S. aureus showed the highest antibiotic susceptibility. Strict adherence to stethoscope disinfection practices by health workers can minimize cross-contamination and ensure improved patient safety in hospital environments.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance of fecal indicators in municipal wastewater treatment plant.
AB  - Antimicrobial resistance of fecal coliforms (n = 153) and enterococci (n = 199) isolates was investigated in municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) based on activated sludge system. The number of fecal indicators (in influent and effluent as well as in the aeration chamber and in return activated sludge mixture) was determined using selective media. Susceptibility of selected strains was tested against 19 (aminoglycosides, aztreonam, carbapenems, cephalosporins, beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitors, fluoroquinolones, penicillines, tetracycline and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole) and 17 (high-level aminoglycosides, ampicillin, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, fluoroquinolones, glycopeptides, linezolid, lincosamides, nitrofuration, streptogramins, tetracycline) antimicrobial agents respectively. Among enterococci the predominant species were Enterococcus faecium (60.8%) and Enterococcus faecalis (22.1%), while remaining isolates belonged to Enterococcus hirae (12.1%), Enterococcus casseliflavus/gallinarum (4.5%), and Enterococcus durans (0.5%). Resistance to nitrofuration and erythromycin was common among enterococci (53% and 44%, respectively), and followed by resistance to ciprofloxacin (29%) and tetracycline (20%). The resistance phenotypes related to glycopeptides (up to 3.2%) and high-level aminoglycosides (up to 5.4%) were also observed. Most frequently, among Escherichia coli isolates the resistance patterns were found for ampicillin (34%), piperacillin (24%) and tetracycline (23%). Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing E. coli was detected once, in the aeration chamber. In the study the applied wastewater treatment processes considerably reduced the number of fecal indicators. Nevertheless their number in the WWTP effluent was higher than 10(4) CFU per 100 ml and periodically contained 90% of bacteria with antimicrobial resistance patterns. The positive selection of isolates with antimicrobial resistance patterns was observed during the treatment processes. Substantial concern should be paid to the isolates resistant to 3 or more chemical classes of antimicrobials (MAR). In treated wastewater MAR E. coli and MAR enterococci constituted respectively 9% and 29% of tested isolates.
TI  - Fluorescence in situ hybridization rapidly detects three different pathogenic bacteria in urinary tract infection samples.
AB  - The detection of pathogenic bacteria in urine is an important criterion for diagnosing urinary tract infections (UTIs). By using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with rRNA-targeted, fluorescently labeled oligonucleotide probes, bacterial pathogens present in urine samples were identified within 3-4 h. In this study, three probes that are specific for Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus were designed based on the conserved 16S RNA sequences, whereas probe Eub338 broadly recognizes all bacteria. We collected a total of 1000 urine samples, and 325 of these samples tested positive for a UTI via traditional culturing techniques; additionally, all 325 of these samples tested positive with the Eub338 probe in FISH analysis. FISH analyses with species-specific probes were performed in parallel to the test the ability to differentiate among several pathogenic bacteria. The samples for these experiments included 76 E. coli infected samples, 32 E. faecalis infected samples and 9 S. aureus infected samples. Compared to conventional methods of bacterial identification, the FISH method produced positive results for >90% of the samples tested. FISH has the potential to become an extremely useful diagnostic tool for UTIs because it has a quick turnaround time and high accuracy.
TI  - Preservation of viability and antibacterial activity of Lactobacillus spp. in calcium alginate beads.
AB  - The objective of the study was to produce calcium alginate beads able to deliver  Lactobacillus spp. (Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Lactobacillus lactis) with preserved viability and antibacterial activity. Four types of beads, containing entrapped (E), surface and entrapped (ES), surface (S) and concentrated surface and entrapped lactobacilli (C(ES)) were prepared and physically characterized. The antibacterial activity of lactobacilli cultures before and after immobilization, freeze-drying and throughout storage was studied in relationship to the viable number of lactobacilli. Multi-resistant clinical isolates (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycine-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, VIM-2-metalo-beta-lactamase producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa and CTX-M-15-beta-lactamase producing strains: Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae) were used as indicator strains. Alginate beads in which lactobacilli proliferated to the beads surface (ES and C(ES)) differed significantly from the other types of beads in their physicochemical properties, showing smoother surface morphology, more spherical shape, bigger weight, lower calcium content, density and crushing force. Lactobacilli cultures, at high cell concentrations (10(8)cfu/ml) were active against both Gram-positive and negative multi-resistant bacteria. Beads containing both entrapped and surface lactobacilli (ES) resulted in viability and antibacterial activity most similar to non-processed lactobacilli cultures. The viability and antibacterial activity of the immobilized lactobacilli remained stable after 6 months storage.
TI  - Suprathel-acetic acid matrix versus acticoat and aquacel as an antiseptic dressing: an in vitro study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The treatment of burn wounds is still a challenge regarding the management of antiseptic wound conditioning. Especially, in the United States, silver-containing dressings, such as Acticoat and Aquacel are frequently used. Because silver-containing dressings have well-known drawbacks such as an antimicrobial lack against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, we sought to develop an alternative dressing method. In previous studies, we could demonstrate the excellent antiseptic properties of acetic acid against common burn unit germs, and in another study, the feasibility and suitability of a Suprathel-acetic acid matrix as an antiseptic dressing. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was designed to test the in vitro antimicrobial effect of a Suprathel-acetic acid matrix versus Acticoat and Aquacel. To cover the typical bacterial spectrum of a burn unit, the following Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria strains were tested: Escherichia coli, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-positive Klebsiella pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterococcus faecalis, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. RESULTS: The tests showed an excellent bactericidal effect of the Suprathel-acetic acid matrix particularly with problematic Gram-negative bacteria such as Proteus vulgaris, P. aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii. The efficiency was superior to that of Acicoat and Aquacel. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the notion, that the Suprathel-acetic acid matrix has an excellent bactericidal effect and therefore seems to be suitable as a local antiseptic agent in the treatment of burn wounds.
TI  - Relationship between differential retention of Escherichia coli and Enterococcus  faecalis and variations in enzyme activity in the scallop Patinopecten yessoensis.
AB  - Uptake of Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis and variations of trypsin amylase activity acid phosphatase and superoxide dismutase in tissue of the scallop Patinopecten yessoensis were detected. The results showed that P. yessoensis accumulated E. faecalis in larger numbers and more rapidly than E. coli, both with the highest concentration in the digestive tract and lowest in hemolymph. Compared to E. coli, all scallops exposed to E. faecalis showed significantly higher trypsin and AMS activity. SOD activity in hemocytes and ACP activity in hemolymph was significantly higher in the treatments with 5 log(10)CFU/ml E. coli than with E. faecalis. But no significant differences in ACP activity of P. yessoensis exposed to a 3 log(10)CFU/ml inoculum of both bacteria were recorded. In conclusion, the mass retention of gut microflora in P. yessoensis is positively correlated with digestive enzymes activity and negatively correlated with ACP activity in the hemocyte.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of doripenem against bacterial isolates from humans and animals.
AB  
TI  - Pitucamycin: structural merger of a phenoxazinone with an epoxyquinone antibiotic.
AB  - Chemical profiling of a Streptomyces griseus strain isolated from an old building with moisture damage led to the discovery of two novel phenoxazinones, chandrananimycin D and pitucamycin , along with the known grixazone B. Pitucamycin represents an unprecedented hybrid molecule composed of a phenoxazinone and an enaminomycin-like epoxyquinone moiety.
TI  - Seasonal variation, chemical composition, and analgesic and antimicrobial activities of the essential oil from leaves of Tetradenia riparia (Hochst.) Codd in southern Brazil.
AB  - The seasonal variation of the chemical composition of the essential oil from fresh leaves of Tetradenia riparia (Hochst.) Codd grown in southern Brazil was analyzed by GC-MS, and the analgesic and antimicrobial activities of this oil were assayed. The yield of essential oil ranged from 0.17% to 0.26%, with the maximum amount in winter and the minimum in spring. The results obtained from principal components analysis (PCA) revealed the existence of high chemical variability in the different seasons. The samples were clearly discriminated into three groups: winter, autumn, and spring-summer. Samples collected during winter contained the highest percentages of calyculone (24.70%), abietadiene (13.54%), and viridiflorol (4.20%). In autumn, the major constituents were ledol (8.74%) and cis-muurolol-5-en-4-alpha-ol (13.78%). Samples collected in spring-summer contained the highest percentages of fenchone (12.67%), 14-hydroxy-9-epi-caryophyllene (24.36%), and alpha-cadinol (8.33%). Oxygenated sesquiterpenes were predominant in all the samples analyzed. The observed chemovariation might be environmentally determined by a seasonal influence. The essential oil, when given orally at a dose of 200 mg/kg, exhibited good analgesic activity on acetic acid-induced writhing in mice, inhibiting the constrictions by 38.94% to 46.13%, and this effect was not affected by seasonal variation. The antimicrobial activity of the essential oil against the bacterial strains: Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumonia, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, and Enterobacter cloacae, and the pathogenic fungus Candida albicans was assessed by the disc diffusion method and determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration. The results obtained, followed by measurement of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), indicated that S. aureus, B. subtilis, and Candida albicans were the most sensitive microorganisms, showing largest inhibition, and the lowest MIC values varied from 15.6 to 31.2 microg/mL, 7.8 to 15.6 microg/mL, and 31.2 to 62.5 microg/mL, respectively.
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial, acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase inhibitory activities of novel ester and hydrazide derivatives of 3(2H)-pyridazinone.
AB  - In the current study, some novel ethyl 6- [(substituted-phenylpiperazine]-3(2H)-pyridazinone-2-yl propionate III and 6-[(substituted-phenylpiperazine]-3(2H)-pyridazinone-2-yl propionohydrazide IV derivatives were synthesized as acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) inhibitors. The structures of these new pyridazinone derivatives were confirmed by their IR, 1H-NMR spectra and elementary analysis. 6-Substituted-3(2H)-pyridazinone-2-yl propionate IIIa-e derivatives showed significant inhibitory activity against AChE and BChE. 6-[4-(3-Trifluoromethylphenyl)piperazine]-3(2H)-pyridazinone-2-yl propionate IIIe has been found to be the most active compound in terms of inhibition of either AChE or BChE. Compound IIIe exhibited inhibitory activity close to that of galantamine (CAS 357-70-0) and did not show any selectivity between the two enzymes. Also the antimicrobial activities of III and IV derivatives have been evaluated. All III and IV derivatives exhibited poor antibacterial activities but moderate antifungal activities.
TI  - Lycopersicon esculentum seeds: an industrial byproduct as an antimicrobial agent.
AB  - Lycopersicon esculentum (tomato) fruit is a widely studied matrix. However, only  few works focus their attention on its seeds, which constitute a major byproduct of the tomato processing industry. In this study the antimicrobial potential of ten different tomato seed extracts from "Bull's heart" and "Cherry" varieties were analyzed against Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Micrococcus luteus, Enterococcus faecalis and Bacillus cereus) and Gram-negative (Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella typhimurium) bacteria and fungi (Candida albicans, Aspergillus fumigatus and Trichophyton rubrum). Regarding antibacterial capacity, the different extracts were revealed to be active only against Gram-positive bacteria, E. faecalis being the most susceptible one (MIC: 2.5-10 mg/mL). Concerning antifungal activity, "Bull's heart" extracts were the most active. In a general way C. albicans was the most susceptible species (MIC: 5-10 mg/mL). The chemical composition of the extracts was also pursued, concerning organic acids, phenolics and fatty acids, in order to establish a possible relationship with the observed antimicrobial effect.
TI  - Biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles by Streptomyces hygroscopicus and antimicrobial activity against medically important pathogenic microorganisms.
AB  - Biological reduction of aqueous silver ions by extracellular components of Streptomyces hygroscopicus has facilitated the development of industrially viable greener methods for the synthesis of technologically important silver nanoparticles (AgNPs). The synthesized aqueous products showed the characteristic absorption spectra at 420 nm, which confirmed the presence of AgNPs. X-ray diffraction patterns displayed typical peaks of crystalline silver at approximately 38 degrees , approximately 45 degrees and approximately 65 degrees . The AgNPs were determined to be spherical (20-30 nm) with a purity of 70% as determined by FE-SEM, TEM, bio-AFM, XRD, and energy dispersive X-ray analysis. Furthermore, the biosynthesized AgNPs significantly inhibited the growth of medically important pathogenic gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus subtilis and Enterococcus faecalis), gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium) and yeast (Candida albicans). Thus, bioconversion of silver nanoparticles by S. hygroscopicus could be employed as a potential nanomedicine to eliminate pathogenic microorganisms.
TI  - Antibacterial & antiplasmid activities of Helicteres isora L.
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: The multiple drug resistance (MDR) is a serious health problem and major challenge to the global drug discovery programmes. Most of the genetic determinants that confer resistance to antibiotics are located on R-plasmids in bacteria. The present investigation was undertaken to investigate the ability of organic extract of the fruits of Helicteres isora to cure R-plasmids from certain clinical isolates. METHODS: Active fractions demonstrating antibacterial and antiplasmid activities were isolated from the acetone extracts of shade dried fruits of H. isora by bioassay guided fractionation. Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of antibiotics and organic extracts was determined by agar dilution method. Plasmid curing activity of organic fractions was determined by evaluating the ability of bacterial colonies (pre treated with organic fraction for 18 h) to grow in the presence of antibiotics. The physical loss of plasmid DNA in the cured derivatives was further confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis. RESULTS: The active fraction did not inhibit the growth of either the clinical isolates or the strains harbouring reference plasmids even at a concentration of 400 microg/ml. However, the same fraction could cure plasmids from Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus and E. coli (RP4) at curing efficiencies of 14, 26, 22 and 2 per cent respectively. The active fraction mediated plasmid curing resulted in the subsequent loss of antibiotic resistance encoded in the plasmids as revealed by antibiotic resistance profile of cured strains. The physical loss of plasmid was also confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: The active fraction of acetone extract of H. isora fruits cured R-plasmids from Gram-positive and Gram-negative clinical isolates as well as reference strains. Such plasmid loss reversed the multiple antibiotic resistance in cured derivatives making them sensitive to low concentrations of antibiotics. Acetone fractions of H. isora may be a source to develop antiplasmid agents of natural origin to contain the development and spread of plasmid borne multiple antibiotic resistance.
TI  - [Evaluation of the antimicrobial susceptibility profile of microorganisms isolated from urine in the region of Vale do Sousa and Tamega].
AB  - The urinary tract is one of the more common sites of bacterial infections, especially in women. Urinary infection can be defined as an infection of urinary tract structures which occurs, generally, as a consequence of the presence or colonization by urine bacteria. The aim of this study was to determine the etiology of urinary tract infections and their susceptibility to antimicrobial agents in the region of Vale do Sousa and Tamega. From February 2008 to January 2009, 18653 urine cultures were analyzed. From these cultures 1037 were positive. From this total of positive cultures, 18,3% were from males and 81.7% were from females. In bacteriological positive tests, 23 different strains of microorganisms were found. It was verified that the most frequent microorganism was Escherichia coli, followed by Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. For antimicrobial susceptibility it was verified that Escherichia coli showed low susceptibility to amoxicillin and cotrimoxazole. Proteus mirabilis showed good susceptibility to cefotaxime and low to cotrimoxazole, amoxicillin and ciprofloxacin. For Klebsiella pneumoniae was found only a reasonable susceptibility to gentamicin and Enterococcus faecalis showed amoxicillin susceptibility. Pseudomonas aeruginosa showed low susceptibility to all antibiotics analyzed with the exception of the combination piperacillin/tazobactam. In conclusion, this study shows that Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella pneumoniae are the three main microorganisms that causes urinary infections in the region of Vale do Sousa and Tamega. Therefore, the antimicrobial empirically used must have a spectrum against enterobacteria, because they are the most likely to be present in urinary tract infections acquired in the community. A periodic analysis of the susceptibility profile should be performed over time for each region in order to help in the beginning of the empirical antimicrobial treatment.
TI  - Spectral, thermal and in vitro antimicrobial studies of cyclohexylamine-N-dithiocarbamate transition metal complexes.
AB  - Transition metal complexes of the type [M(L)(2)] and those containing monodentate phosphines of the type [M(L)(2)(PPh(3))] {M=Ni, Co, Cu and Zn; L=cyclohexylamine-N-dithiocarbamate; PPh(3)=triphenylphosphine} have been synthesized. The complexes were characterized using IR, UV-vis, NMR spectroscopy, and thermal analysis (TGA). The (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR and (31)P NMR showed the expected signals for the dithiocarbamate and triphenylphosphine moieties. The spectral studies in all compounds revealed that the coordination of metals occurs via the sulphur atom of the dithiocarbamate ligand in a bidentate fashion. Thermal behavior of the complexes showed that the complexes were more stable than their parent ligands. The ligand moiety is lost in the first step and the rest of the organic moiety decomposes in the subsequent steps. Furthermore, the ligand and their metal complexes were screened in vitro for their antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella typhi, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bacillus cereus and antifungal activities against Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus carbonarius, Aspergillus niger and Aspergillus fumigatus. The metal complexes exhibited higher antimicrobial activity than the parent ligands. Generally, the zinc complexes were effective against the growth of bacteria with Zn(L)(2) displaying broad spectrum bacteriocidal activity at concentrations of 50microg/mL; and Ni(L)(2) was more effective against the growth of fungi at concentrations of 100-400microg/mL under laboratory conditions.
TI  - [Investigation of distribution of bacteria and fungi in severe acute pancreatitis].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the spectrum of bacteria and fungi in different sites in severe acute pancreatitis (SAP). METHODS: The prospective study was performed in 205 patients with SAP treated from January 2000 to December 2008. The Infection rate of bacteria and fungi was observed prospectively in pancreatic necrosis and(or) pus form abdomen, body fluids and deep vein catheter in SAP. Body fluids and pancreatic necrosis were cultured twice a week. Central venous catheter was cultured when it had been placed for two weeks. Blood was cultured for bacteria and fungi when body temperature was more than 39 degrees C. Constituent ratio of bacteria and fungi was observed in different sites and in all sites within 28 days after onset of SAP. RESULTS: There were 937 pathogens, among which infection rates of gram-negative bacteria was higher than gram-positive bacteria and fungi (P < 0.05), the infection rates of gam-positive bacteria and fungi were similar. Infection rates of gram-negative bacteria in pancreatic necrosis (55.2%), bile (55.4%), blood (68.1%) and central venous catheter (44.4%) were increased significantly (P < 0.05) compared with gram-positive bacteria and (30.2%, 33.9%, 23.4%, 38.9%) and fungi (14.6%, 10.7%, 8.5%, 16.7%); however, infection rate of fungi (59.6%) was increased significantly (P < 0.05) compared with gram-negative bacteria (24.0%) and gram-positive bacteria (16.3%) in urine; infection rate of gram-negative bacteria (53.2%) was significantly higher (P < 0.05) than that of fungi (27.1%) and gram-positive bacteria (19.7%) in sputum. Infection rate of non-zymogenic bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia) in gram-negative bacteria in pancreatic necrosis, bile, blood, central venous catheter and sputum was significantly higher than that of zymogenic bacteria (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae) (P < 0.01); infection rate of zymogenic bacteria (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli) was higher significantly (P < 0.01) than that of non-zymogenic bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii). Infection rate of staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus was significantly higher (P < 0.05) than that of Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium in pancreatic necrosis and sputum;but infection rate of Enterococcus faecium in bile and urine was significantly higher than other gram-positive bacteria (P < 0.05). There was not difference among gram-positive bacteria;however, infection rate of Staphylococcus epidermidis in central venous catheter was increased significantly (P < 0.05). Infection rate of candida mycoderma in pancreatic necrosis, bile, urine and sputum was significantly higher than that of tricho bacteria (P < 0.05). The peak of infection rate of microbes in body fluid was within 2 to 3 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Constituent ratio in gram-negative, gram-positive bacteria and fungi as well as their species in different sites is diverse. The peak of infection rate of microbes is 2 to 3 weeks after onset of the disease.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of extracts from plants of central Argentina--isolation of an active principle from Achyrocline satureioides.
AB  - The great increase in bacterial infections is fueling interest in the search for  antibacterial products of plant origin. Extracts obtained from 51 native and naturalized plants from central Argentina were therefore evaluated for their IN VITRO inhibitory activity on pathogenic bacteria with the aim of selecting the most active ones as new sources of effective antibiotics. The susceptibility of reference and clinical strains of Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis, and Staphylococcus aureus was determined. Extracts from Achyrocline satureioides, Flourensia oolepis, Lepechinia floribunda, and Lithrea molleoides were the most potent, with MIC and MBC values ranging from 0.006 to 2 and 0.012 to 10 mg/mL, respectively, on both gram-positive and negative bacteria. The antibacterial activity-guided isolation of A. satureioides ethanol extract showed 23-methyl-6-O-desmethylauricepyrone (1) to be the most active compound. This compound showed inhibitory effects against gram-positive bacteria with MIC and MBC values of 0.002 and 0.008 mg/mL, respectively, while on gram-negative strains, the MIC and MBC were 0.062-0.250 and 0.062-0.500 mg/mL, respectively. The strong antibacterial activity shown by the four plant extracts or the compound isolated from A. satureioides suggests that they could become part of the arsenal of antibacterial drugs currently used.
TI  - Imbalance of NKp44(+)NKp46(-) and NKp44(-)NKp46(+) natural killer cells in the intestinal mucosa of patients with Crohn's disease.
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Mucosal natural killer (NK) cells that produce interleukin (IL)-22 mediate intestinal homeostasis and inflammation in mice. However, their role in the pathogenesis of human inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) is not known. We investigated intestinal NK cells in intestinal mucosa samples of patients with Crohn's disease (CD). METHODS: We isolated lamina propria NK cells from intestinal mucosal samples of patients with IBD and subjects without IBD (controls) and analyzed expression patterns of cell surface molecules and cytokine production. Interactions between lamina propria NK cells and intestinal macrophages were examined. RESULTS: In intestinal mucosa samples from controls, NKp44 and NKp46 were expressed differentially on CD3(-)CD56(+) NK cells, NKp44(+)NKp46(-) (NKp44(+)) NK cells expressed CD127 and the transcription factor retinoic acid-related orphan receptor C (RORC) and produced IL-22 whereas NKp44(-)NKp46(+) (NKp46(+)) NK cells did not express CD127 or RORC and produced interferon (IFN)-gamma. NKp46(+) NK cells were predominant in intestinal mucosa of patients with CD compared with controls or patients with ulcerative colitis. Upon interaction with intestinal inflammatory macrophages NKp46(+), NK cells from patients with CD were activated via IL-23 and produced IFN-gamma; this activation required cell-to-cell contact. CONCLUSIONS: The balance of NKp44(+)/NKp46(+) NK cells is disrupted in intestinal mucosa of patients with CD. NKp46(+) NK cells might mediate the pathogenesis of CD by producing IFN-gamma.
TI  - Prevalence and clinical outcome of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in hospitalized patients with liver cirrhosis: a prospective observational study in central part of Croatia.
AB  - Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is a serious complication of liver cirrhosis and is defined as infected ascites in the absence of any recognizable secondary cause of infection. The aim of the study was to evaluate the prevalence, incidence, pathogens and clinical outcome of SBP. This prospective observational study included 108 cirrhotic patients with ascites treated during 18 months. Patients were divided into two groups according to diagnostic criteria of SBP: SBP group (n=23) and non-SBP group (n=85). Differences in clinical outcomes between the two groups were analyzed, including mortality rate, incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding, bacteremia/sepsis and frequency of rehospitalization. The pathogens responsible for SBP were analyzed in SBP group. The prevalence of SBP was 21% and incidence 14.1% per year. Statistically significant between-group differences were recorded in mortality (26% vs. 4.7%; P=0.017), incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding (39% vs. 11.7%; P=0.015) and rehospitalization frequency (47.8% vs. 20%; P=0.05). The incidence of sepsis following episode of gastrointestinal bleeding was similar in both groups (55.5% vs. 50%; P=0.892). The following pathogens were responsible for SBP: Escherichia coli (n=7), MRSA (n=2), Acinetobacter spp. (n=2), Staphylococcus aureus (n=1), Streptococcus spp. (n=1), Staphylococcus epidermidis (n=1) and Enterococcus faecalis (n=1). As indicated by study results, the incidence and mortality of SBP were high. Patients with liver cirrhosis and gastrointestinal hemorrhage were found to be at a high risk of developing sepsis with or without clinically proven SBP. The pathogens responsible for SBP were mostly gram-negative microorganisms; however, there were also a significant proportion of gram-positive microorganisms and hospital infections with antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Study results suggested the spectrum of pathogens to change due to the selection of antibiotic-resistant bacteria within the hospital setting.
TI  - Effects of autochthonous microbial community on the die-off of fecal indicators in tropical beach sand.
AB  - The recently observed high levels of fecal indicators in beach sand confound beach water monitoring efforts. The high levels of fecal indicators may be caused by the loss or the reduced activities of common environmental stresses controlling die-off in the sand. Microcosm experiments were conducted to compare the effects of biotic stresses from autochthonous sand bacteria, protozoa, and viruses on Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis in two tropical beach sands. The inhibition of protozoan activities by cycloheximide did not significantly affect the die-off of E. coli, indicating that protozoan predation played a limited role in beach sand. The contribution from phage infection to E. coli die-off was also negligible. Consequently, autochthonous bacteria were identified as the predominant biotic stress to the die-off of E. coli in beach sand. Subsequent experiments demonstrated that the beach sand had a very low protozoan concentration and low protozoan growth potential when compared with various environmental samples. Co-culturing of E. coli with autochthonous sand bacterial isolates significantly enhanced E. coli die-off. PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis revealed a complex sand bacterial community, suggesting that bacterial antagonistic effects may be widespread. The study also found that E. faecalis exhibited a much longer survival in beach sand compared with E. coli.

TI  - High level expression and purification of antimicrobial human cathelicidin LL-37  in Escherichia coli.
AB  - The human antimicrobial peptide LL-37 is a cationic peptide with antimicrobial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative microorganisms. This work describes the development of an expression system based on Escherichia coli capable of high production of the recombinant LL-37. The fusion protein Trx-LL-37 was expressed under control of T7 promoter. The expression of T7 polymerase in the E. coli strain constructed in this work was controlled by regulation mechanisms of the arabinose promoter. The expression plasmid was stabilized by the presence of parB locus which ensured higher homology of the culture during cultivation without antibiotic selection pressure. This system was capable of producing up to 1 g of fusion protein per 1 l of culture. The subsequent semipreparative HPLC allowed us to isolate 40 mg of pure LL-37. LL-37 showed high antimicrobial activity against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive microorganisms. Its activity against Candida albicans was practically nonexistent. Minimal Inhibition Concentration (MIC) determined for E. coli was 1.65 microM; for Staphylococcus aureus 2.31 microM, and for Enterococcus faecalis 5.54 microM. The effects of cathelicidin on E. coli included the ability to permeabilize both cell membranes, as could be observed by the increase of beta-galactosidase activity in extracellular space in time. Physiological changes were studied by scanning electron microscopy; Gram-positive microorganisms did not show any visible changes in cell shapes while the changes observed on E. coli cells were evident. The results of this work show that the herein designed expression system is capable of producing adequate quantities of active human antimicrobial peptide LL-37.
TI  - Molecular characterization of antimicrobial resistance in enterococci and Escherichia coli isolates from European wild rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus).
AB  - A total of 44 Escherichia coli and 64 enterococci recovered from 77 intestinal samples of wild European rabbits in Portugal were analyzed for resistance to antimicrobial agents. Resistance in E. coli isolates was observed for ampicillin, tetracycline, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, streptomycin, gentamicin, tobramycin, nalidixic acid, ciprofloxacin and chloramphenicol. None of the E. coli isolates produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs). The bla(TEM), aadA, aac(3)-II, tet(A) and/or tet(B), and the catA genes were demonstrated in all ampicillin, streptomycin, gentamicin, tetracycline, and chloramphenicol-resistant isolates respectively, and the sul1 and/or sul2 and/or sul3 genes in 4 of 5 sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim resistant isolates. Of the enterococcal isolates, Enterococcus faecalis was the most prevalent detected species (39 isolates), followed by E. faecium (21 isolates) and E. hirae (4 isolates). More than one-fourth (29.7%) of the isolates were resistant to tetracycline; 20.3% were resistant to erythromycin, 14.1% were resistant to ciprofloxacin and 10.9% were resistant to high-level-kanamycin. Lower level of resistance (<10%) was detected for ampicillin, quinupristin/dalfopristin and high-level-gentamicin, -streptomycin. No vancomycin-resistance was detected in the enterococci isolates. Resistance genes detected included aac(6')-aph(2''), ant(6)-Ia, tet(M) and/or tet(L) in all gentamicin, streptomycin and tetracycline-resistant isolates respectively. The aph(3')-IIIa gene was detected in 6 of 7 kanamycin-resistant isolates, the erm(B) gene in 11 of 13 erythromycin-resistant isolates and the vat(D) gene in the quinupristin/dalfopristin-resistant E. faecium isolate. This survey showed that faecal bacteria such as E. coli and enterococci of wild rabbits could be a reservoir of antimicrobial resistance genes.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance in faecal bacteria (Escherichia coli, Enterococcus spp.) in feral pigeons.
AB  - AIMS: To determine the presence of antibiotic-resistant faecal Escherichia coli and Enterococcus spp. in feral pigeons (Columba livia forma domestica) in the Czech Republic. METHODS AND RESULTS: Cloacal swabs of feral pigeons collected in the city of Brno in 2006 were cultivated for antibiotic-resistant E. coli. Resistance genes, class 1 and 2 integrons, and gene cassettes were detected in resistant isolates by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The samples were also cultivated for enterococci. Species status of enterococci isolates was determined using repetitive extragenic palindromic-PCR. Resistance genes were detected in resistant enterococci by PCR. E. coli isolates were found in 203 of 247 pigeon samples. Antibiotic resistance was recorded in three (1.5%, n(E. coli) =203) isolates. Using agar containing ciprofloxacin, 12 (5%, n(samples) =247) E. coli strains resistant to ciprofloxacin were isolated. No ESBL-producing E. coli isolates were detected. A total of 143 enterococci were isolated: Ent. faecalis (36 isolates), Ent. faecium (27), Ent. durans (19), Ent. hirae (17), Ent. mundtii (17), Ent. gallinarum (12), Ent. casseliflavus (12) and Ent. columbae (3). Resistance to one to four antibiotics was detected in 45 (31%) isolates. Resistances were determined by tetK, tetL, tetM, tetO, aac(6')aph(2''), ant(4')-Ia, aph(3')-IIIa, ermB, pbp5, vanA and vanC1 genes. CONCLUSIONS: Antibiotic-resistant E. coli and Enterococcus spp. occurred in feral pigeons in various prevalences. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Feral pigeon should be considered a risk species for spreading in the environment antimicrobial resistant E. coli and enterococci.
TI  - Linum usitatissimum (linseed/flaxseed) fixed oil: antimicrobial activity and efficacy in bovine mastitis.
AB  - PURPOSE: In vitro antimicrobial activity and in vivo therapeutic efficacy of L. usitatissimum (linseed/flaxseed) fixed oil in bovine mastitis were investigated. METHOD: In vitro antimicrobial activity of L. usitatissimum fixed oil was evaluated against a number of microorganisms by disc diffusion method and MIC determination. The in vivo efficacy of the oil was evaluated in nine mastitis-affected cows divided into three groups (three in each group), following once-a-day intramammary infusion of oil, cefoperazone or an oil-cefoperazone combination for 7 days and by monitoring the California mastitis test score, somatic cell count and microbial count in milk samples. RESULTS: The in vitro antimicrobial activity of the oil against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae and Escherichia coli was comparable to that of cefoperazone while the antimicrobial activity against Enterococcus faecalis, Micrococcus luteus and Candida albicans, was greater than that of cefoperazone. In the in vivo study, the oil exhibited significant reduction in the California mastitis test score and somatic cell count in milk samples from infected udders following 7 days of intramammary administration suggesting its anti-inflammatory effect. The microbial count in milk samples was also reduced significantly following oil treatment. The effects were comparable to the treatment by cefoperazone (Mastiwock) alone or in combination with the oil. Apparently, the anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties of the oil contribute to its therapeutic efficacy in mastitis; the oil could be used as an alternative treatment for bovine mastitis CONCLUSION: The results suggest possible therapeutic potential of L. usitatissimum fixed oil in bovine mastitis.
TI  - In vitro bactericidal activity of human beta-defensin 2 against nosocomial strains.
AB  - Human beta-defensin 2 (hBD-2) is a 41-amino acid cationic peptide of the innate immune system that serves as antimicrobial molecule. We determined the bactericidal activity of synthetic hBD-2 against nosocomial strains belonging to eight different bacterial species and exhibiting various antimicrobial resistance phenotypes. The native disulfide connectivity was found essential for the bactericidal activity of hBD-2, while sodium chloride concentration was reversely associated with its potency. hBD-2 exhibited high bactericidal activity against Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium and Staphylococcus aureus clinical strains. Characteristically, A. baumannii strains that exhibited multi-drug resistant (MDR) phenotypes were susceptible to lower concentrations of hBD-2 (vLD(90)=3.25-4.5 microg/ml) in comparison with non-MDR (wild-type) A. baumannii strains (vLD(90)=3.90-9.35 microg/ml). Bactericidal activity of hBD-2 was less pronounced against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis strains but was significantly enhanced against strains of these species that exhibited resistance to several beta-lactam antibiotics. These observations give indications that the natural hBD-2 has a potential therapeutic role against bacterial pathogens and particularly against those exhibiting MDR phenotypes.
TI  - Effects of myrcia ovata cambess. Essential oil on planktonic growth of gastrointestinal microorganisms and biofilm formation of enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - The essential oil from the leaves of Myrcia ovata Cambess., commonly used in Brazil for the treatment of gastric illnesses, was screened for antimicrobial activity and action in the formation of microbial biofilms by Enterococcus faecalis. The oil was obtained by hydrodistillation using a clevenger-type system. Its chemical composition was analyzed using GC and GC-MS. Both MIC and MBC of the essential oil were determined by broth microdilution techniques and agar dilution method. The essential oil showed antimicrobial activity against E. faecalis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella choleraesuis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Candida parapsilosis. The results showed that the essential oil of M. ovata Cambess. was effective against the formation of biofilm by E. faecalis when compared with the control. Four volatile compounds, representing 92.1 % of the oil, were identified and geranial was the major component (50.4 %). At the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oil from leaves of M. ovata.
TI  - Study of the direct bactericidal effect of Nd:YAG and diode laser parameters used in endodontics on pigmented and nonpigmented bacteria.
AB  - Laser light can be used during endodontic procedures to sterilize the root canal  by destroying bacteria. Previous in-vitro studies that investigated the mechanism of the destruction of bacteria inhabiting the root canal by 1,064-nm Nd:YAG and 808-nm diode laser light used substrates that absorb light in the near-infrared (NIR) spectrum. These substrates heat the bacterial microenvironment, which possibly contributes to cell death. To determine the direct effect of laser light on the bacterial sample in the absence of detrimental heating, a sapphire substrate, which is virtually transparent in NIR spectrum, was inoculated with bacterial samples and subjected to laser irradiation at 1,064 nm (1.5 W, 15 Hz) and at 808 nm (1.5 W, 20 Hz). Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, and Porphyromonas gingivalis bacteria were used. E. faecalis and E. coli were largely unaffected by laser light. The viability of P. gingivalis, a pigmented bacterium, was directly affected by both NIR wavelengths (a 57% decrease of viability at 1,064 nm and a 31% decrease at 808 nm). Our results indicate that the primary mediator of cell death appears to be the interaction between NIR laser light and the bacterial microenvironment, most likely in the form of heating. Our research suggests that when optimizing the efficacy of laser-assisted endodontic sterilization of the root canal, the optical characteristics of the bacterial microenvironment play a key role, as nonpigmented bacteria appear to be virtually transparent at 808 nm and 1,064 nm.
TI  - Evaluation of the epinecidin-1 peptide as an active ingredient in cleaning solutions against pathogens.
AB  - We tested the activity of epinecidin-1, a novel antimicrobial peptide structurally related to pleurocidin, in commercial cleaning solutions stored at 4 and 25 degrees C for 7 and 14 days. The peptide's activities against Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Propionibacterium acnes, and Candida albicans were measured in a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) determination, minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) determination, disk diffusion test, and a count of the bacterial numbers. Exposure to epinecidn-1 in a cleaning solution following MIC value comparisons in the disk diffusion test and counts of bacterial numbers after 16, 24, 48, and 72 h suggested that bacterial numbers were much lower than those treated with only commercial cleaning solutions for all bacteria. The efficacy of the antimicrobial activities of inhibiting bacterial numbers by epinecidin-1 in cleaning solutions at a low pH and a low temperature was not affected. Given its simple structure and antimicrobial activity, epinecidin-1 may be a useful component of microbicides designed to prevent pathogen infections and/or remediate abnormal vaginal or skin flora.
TI  - Formulation and bacterial phototoxicity of curcumin loaded alginate foams for wound treatment applications: studies on curcumin and curcuminoides XLII.
AB  - Curcumin loaded alginate foams are proposed for application in antimicrobial photodynamic therapy of infected wounds. The drug loaded foams were formulated to provide a burst release of the photosensitizer when hydrated. The foams remained intact after hydration and would be possible to remove from the wound prior to irradiation without causing any tissue damage. The characterization of the prepared foams showed that both curcumin loaded and unloaded foams hydrated within 1 min and absorbed from 12 to 16 times their dry weight of a model physiological fluid. Curcumin, the model photosensitizer, has an extremely low solubility in water and may aggregate in aqueous environment. Cyclodextrins (CDs) and polyethylene glycol 400 (PEG 400) were therefore selected as solubilizers of curcumin in the foams to provide a burst release of the photosensitizer. Exposure to the prepared foams in combination with visible light irradiation ( approximately 9.7 J/cm(2)) resulted in >6 log reduction of Entrococcus faecalis cells. However, curcumin mediated photokilling of Escherichia coli was ineffective when CDs were selected as solubilizer of curcumin in the foams. An 81% reduction in viable E. coli cells was detected after treatment with the foam containing PEG 400 as the only solubilizer of curcumin combined with visible light irradiation ( approximately 29 J/cm(2)).
TI  - Prophylactic cefdinir for pediatric cases of complicated urinary tract infection.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study evaluated the effect of prophylactic cefdinir (3 mg/kg given once daily) for the prevention of recurrent and complicated urinary tract infections (UTI) in pediatric patients. METHODS: The study included 14 infants who were observed for at least 6 months following the first signs of infection (eight boys, six girls; mean age at admission [+/- SD]: 6.2 [+/- 7.4] months). Twelve patients had vesico-ureteric reflux (grade I, two; grade II, three; grade III, six; grade IV, one), and two patients had ureteropelvic junction stenosis. RESULTS: No patients discontinued medication due to diarrhea or other adverse drug reactions. The patients had a 6-month recurrence-free rate of 93% (13/14); only one patient had recurrent UTI. The mean urinary cefdinir concentration was 16.3 [+/- 11.7]microg/mL; there was considerable variability among individual measurements, even though the samples were collected at similar intervals after drug intake (mean 18.00 [+/- 2.63] h after dose). However, the lowest measured urinary cefdinir concentration (1.16 microg/mL) was sufficient to eradicate Escherichia coli, one of the most significant causes of UTI. Fecal cultures, obtained at monthly clinic visits during the observation period, indicated that the patients' E. coli strains were very sensitive to cefdinir. No patients were infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa or other non-fermenting Gram-negative bacilli or fungi. CONCLUSIONS: These results show that cefdinir given 3 mg/kg once daily is very effective and safe for preventing recurrent complicated UTI in infants.
TI  - Standardized comparison of antiseptic efficacy of triclosan, PVP-iodine, octenidine dihydrochloride, polyhexanide and chlorhexidine digluconate.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study presents a comparative investigation of the antimicrobial  efficacy of the antiseptics PVP-iodine, triclosan, chlorhexidine, octenidine and polyhexanide used for pre-surgical antisepsis and antiseptic treatment of skin, wounds and mucous membranes based on internationally accepted standards. METHODS: MICs and MBCs were determined in accordance with DIN 58940-7 and 58940-8 using Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus), Enterococcus faecalis (including vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus), Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Clostridium perfringens, Haemophilus influenzae and Candida albicans. The microbicidal efficacy was determined in accordance with DIN EN 1040 and 1275 using S. aureus, P. aeruginosa and C. albicans. RESULTS: For chlorhexidine, octenidine and polyhexanide, MIC(48) and MBC(24) ranged from 16 to 32 mg/L. Maximum values for triclosan ranged from 256 to 512 mg/L, with an efficacy gap against P. aeruginosa, while the maximum values of PVP-iodine were 1024 mg/L, with a gap against S. pneumoniae. Comparing the minimal effective concentrations, octenidine was most effective. After 1 min, only octenidine and PVP-iodine fulfil the requirements for antiseptics. CONCLUSIONS: Tests under standardized and harmonized conditions help to choose the most efficacious agent. When a prolonged contact time is feasible, ranking of agents would be polyhexanide = octenidine > chlorhexidine > triclosan > PVP-iodine. This is consistent with the recommendations for antisepsis of acute wounds. Polyhexanide seems to be preferable for chronic wounds due to its higher tolerability. If an immediate effect is required, ranking would be octenidine = PVP-iodine>> polyhexanide > chlorhexidine > triclosan.
TI  - [Fosfomycin: past, present and future].
AB  - The continuously increasing problem of multidrug-resistant (extended-spectrum beta-lactamase and/or metallo-beta-lactamase producing) bacteria in recent years has created the need to re-evaluate antibiotic therapy for these infections. Fosfomycin is reconsidered to be an alternative treatment agent for such infections. Fosfomycin was first discovered in Spain in 1969 from cultures of Streptomyces species and originally called phosphonomycin. In the early years, fosfomycin was administered parenterally to the patients with many serious infections including meningitis. In some European countries, fosfomycin is occasionally administered for the initial empirical therapy of sepsis or soft-tissue infections. Although in most European countries fosfomycin has been used for many years, it has become available in clinical use only recently in Turkey. In USA, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved fosfomycin only for the treatment of patients with uncomplicated cystitis. The use of fosfomycin in the treatment of multidrug-resistant bacterial infections and in the treatment of pediatric cancer patients with fever and neutropenia in combination with other antibiotics, has withdrawn attention to this agent. Fosfomycin has a rapid bactericidal effect and a wide antibacterial spectrum, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, glycopeptide-susceptible or resistant enterococci and a large number of gram-negative pathogens. Since it has a long serum half-life and high concentrations are achieved in urine after oral administration; fosfomycin deserved further consideration for single-dose treatment of urinary tract infections caused by Escherichia coil and Enterococcus faecalis. In this review article the properties, mechanisms of action and resistance, antibacterial spectrum, clinical use, toxicity and adverse reactions of fosfomycin have been summarized.
TI  - A type III-like restriction endonuclease functions as a major barrier to horizontal gene transfer in clinical Staphylococcus aureus strains.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus is an versatile pathogen that can cause life-threatening infections. Depending on the clinical setting, up to 50% of S. aureus infections are caused by methicillin-resistant strains (MRSA) that in most cases are resistant to many other antibiotics, making treatment difficult. The emergence of community-acquired MRSA drastically changed the picture by increasing the risk of MRSA infections. Horizontal transfer of genes encoding for antibiotic resistance or virulence factors is a major concern of multidrug-resistant S. aureus infections and epidemiology. We identified and characterized a type III-like restriction system present in clinical S. aureus strains that prevents transformation with DNA from other bacterial species. Interestingly, our analysis revealed that some clinical MRSA strains are deficient in this restriction system, and thus are hypersusceptible to the horizontal transfer of DNA from other species, such as Escherichia coli, and could easily acquire a vancomycin-resistance gene from enterococci. Inactivation of this restriction system dramatically increases the transformation efficiency of clinical S. aureus strains, opening the field of molecular genetic manipulation of these strains using DNA of exogenous origin.
TI  - Defensin of the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha): molecular structure, in vitro expression, antimicrobial activity, and potential functions.
AB  - A 409 bp full length defensin gene was cloned and sequenced based on an expressed sequence tag (EST) obtained from a normalized zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) foot cDNA library developed in our laboratory. The D. polymorpha defensin (Dpd) gene encoded a peptide with 76 amino acid residues. The mature Dpd contains 54 amino acids with a fully functional insect defensin A domain. Homologue searching against GenBank database suggested that this Dpd was phylogenetically close to defensins from a group of insects with six conserved cysteine residues. Predicted with homology-modeling method, the three-dimensional structure of Dpd also demonstrated a significant similarity with insect defensin A. The recombinant Dpd was in vitro expressed through an Escherichia coli expression system. The antimicrobial activities of the refolded recombinant Dpd were found against the growth of Morganella sp., Plesiomonas shigelloides, Edwardsiella tarda, E. coli and Staphylococcus aureus aureus (ATCC12598) with the minimal inhibition concentration (MIC) 0.35, 0.43, 1.16, 6.46, and 30.39 microM, respectively. However, with less than 50 microM no detectable inhibition activities were observed against the other four Gram-negative bacteria (Aeromonas salmonicida salmonicida, Motile Aeromonas, Flavobacterium sp., Pseudomonas fluorescens, Shewanella putrifaciens), as well as the other Gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus megaterium ATCC14581, Carnobacterium maltaromaticum ATCC27865, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC19433, and Micrococcus leteus ATCC4698), and the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The RNA fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) of Dpd in the zebra mussel suggested that the Dpd was expressed in a variety of tissues, such as foot, retractor muscle, ctenidium, mantle, hemocytes, gonad, digestive gland, and intestine. By using the quantitative PCR, the expression level of Dpd in the zebra mussel foot was the highest, followed by the muscle. By comparing the amount of Dpd transcripts in the zebra mussel foot under two different byssogenesis conditions (byssogenesis and non-byssogenesis) with qPCR, we found that the higher expression levels of Dpd were always associated with the byssogenesis status from 2 to 4 days after the start of byssogenesis. Findings of this study suggest that the expression of the Dpd gene was upregulated in vivo by byssogeneis, and by hemocytes in vitro upon stimulation with microbial antigens.
TI  - Isolation of bacteriocin-like substances producing bacteria from finished cattle-manure compost and activity evaluation against some food-borne pathogenic and spoilage bacteria.
AB  - A finished compost sample was examined for bacteriocin-like substance production  against five pathogenic bacteria: Salmonella typhimurium EF 85-9, Escherichia coli O157:H7 ATCC 43888, Enterococcus faecalis JCM 8726, Staphylococcus aureus JCM 2151, and Yersinia enterocolitica JCM 7577. At the preliminary detection of bacterial strains exhibiting antimicrobial activity from the compost sample, thirteen strains could be isolated. Screening of the inhibitory activity was done using agar-well diffusion assay and Microtiter plate growth assay. Six bacterial strains from the compost showed an antimicrobial activity against one or more of the tested indicator strains. Four strains (M1-M4) belonged to Shigella species and the other two strains (M5 and M6) belonged to Salmonella species. The antimicrobial activity was sensitive for alpha-chymotrypsin and papain. The antimicrobial substances from M3, M4 and M6 were heat stable when heated for 15 min at 121 degrees C with 100% relative activity. The bacteriocin-like substance produced by strain M2 was partially characterized. It exhibited an inhibitory activity against the tested food-borne pathogenic and spoilage bacteria, except Enterobacter aerogenes JCM 1235 and Lactobacillus plantarum subsp. plantarum JCM 1149. It was stable at a wide range of pH (3-11). There was no loss of activity for up to 3 weeks when stored at 4 and -20 degrees C or for up to 2 weeks when stored at 28 and -80 degrees C. This is the first report indicating the presence of bacteriocin-like activity in animal manure compost.
TI  - Bacteriological quality of drinking water in Nyala, South Darfur, Sudan.
AB  - The objective of this study was to determine the bacterial contaminations in drinking water in Nyala city, South Darfur, Sudan with special reference to the internally displaced people camps (IDPs). Two hundred and forty water samples from different sites and sources including bore holes, hand pumps, dug wells, water points, water reservoir and household storage containers were collected in 2009. The most probable number method was used to detect and count the total coliform, faecal coliform and faecal enterococci. Results revealed that the three indicators bacteria were abundant in all sources except water points. Percentages of the three indicators bacteria count above the permissible limits for drinking water in all samples were 46.4% total coliform, 45.2% faecal coliform and 25.4% faecal enterococci whereas the highest count of the indicators bacteria observed was 1,600 U/100 ml water. Enteric bacteria isolated were Escherichia coli (22.5%), Enterococcus faecalis (20.42%), Klebsiella (15.00%), Citrobacter (2.1%) and Enterobacter (3.33%). The highest contamination of water sources was observed in household storage containers (20%) followed by boreholes (11.25%), reservoirs (6.24%), hand pumps (5.42%) and dug wells (2.49%). Contamination varied from season to season with the highest level in autumn (18.33%) followed by winter (13.75%) and summer (13.32%), respectively. All sources of water in IDP camps except water points were contaminated. Data suggested the importance of greater attention for household contamination, environmental sanitation control and the raise of awareness about water contamination.
TI  - [Investigation of the in vitro antibacterial effects of statins].
AB  - It was previously shown that statins have anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory and anti-oxidant effects. This study was aimed to investigate the in-vitro antibacterial effects of simvastatin and atorvastatin. In this study antibacterial activity of the statins were tested against 16 methicillin-susceptible Stophylococcus aureus (MSSA), 16 methicillin-resistant S.aureus (MRSA), 16 methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (MRCoNS), 9 vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecium, 7 vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecolis, 13 vancomycin-resistant E. faecium, 16 extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) positive Escherichia coli, 16 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 16 Acinetobacter boumannii, 15 ESBL positive Klebsiella pneumoniae, 6 Stenotrophomonas maltophilio by broth microdilution method according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) performance and interpretive guidelines. S. aureus ATCC 29213, S. aureus ATCC 25923, S. aureus ATCC 43300, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, K.pneumoniae ATCC 700603 and E. coli ATCC 35218 were tested as control strains. The results showed that minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values for all isolates were > 128 microg/ml for the two statins tested. However, MIC of simvastatin was 32 microg/ml for S. aureus ATCC 29213 and was 64 microg/ml for S. aureus ATCC 25923 and E. faecalis ATCC 29212 and was > 128 microg/ml for others, but MIC of atorvastatin was > 128 microg/mI for all standard strains. According to these results, we observed that simvastatin and atorvastain had no significant antibacterial effect in vitro. In this study, although no antibacterial effect of statins were determined in vitro, further studies are needed to investigate the combined effect of statins with antibacterial agents in the living organism.
TI  - Nepetalactone content and antibacterial activity of the essential oils from different parts of Nepeta persica.
AB  - The essential oils from the flower, leaf, stem and root of Nepeta persica Boiss., analyzed by GC and GC/MS, were shown to contain 4abeta,7alpha,7abeta-nepetalactone (58.5%, 62.3%, 66.2% and 27.1%, respectively), and 4aalpha,7alpha,7abeta-nepetalactone (33.0%, 28.3%, 24.9% and 7.6%, respectively). The other main component of the flower and stem oils was alpha-pinene (3.6% and 4.4%) and of the leaf oil beta-ocimene (3.6%). In the root oil, other main constituents were alpha-pinene (40.4%), alpha-amorphene (5.3%), gamma-cadinene (2.9%), and cis-calamenene (2.5%). Nepetalactone was the major component of the flower, leaf and stem oils, which are thus important sources of nepetalactone. Antibacterial activities of the flower, leaf, stem and root oils were evaluated using the micro-dilution broth method. Inhibitory effects on Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella typhi and Enterococcus faecalis were recorded. The flower, leaf, stem, and root oils had difference activities against the test microorganisms. The antibacterial property of the essential oils might be ascribed to their high content of nepetalactone isomers.
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial activity of novel Ag-N-hetero-cyclic carbene complexes.
AB  - A series of imidazolidinium ligand precursors are metallated with Ag2O to give silver(I) N-heterocyclic carbene complexes. All compounds were fully characterized by elemental analyses, 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR and IR spectroscopy techniques. All compounds studied in this work were screened for their in vitro antimicrobial activities against the standard strains: Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29212), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 29213), Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853) and the fungi Candida albicans and Candida tropicalis. The new imidazolidin-2-ylidene silver complexes have been found to display effective antimicrobial activity against a series of bacteria and fungi.
TI  - Gold(I) complexes of N-heterocyclic carbene ligands containing benzimidazole: synthesis and antimicrobial activity.
AB  - Gold(I) N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complexes were obtained in good yields from  the corresponding silver complexes by treatment with [AuCl(PPh3)] following the commonly used silver carbene transfer route. The silver complexes were synthesized from the benzimidazolium halide salts by the in situ reactions with Ag2O in dichloromethane as a solvent at room temperature. All gold complexes have been characterized by 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR and IR spectroscopy and elemental analysis. Au-NHC complexes were evaluated for their in vitro antimicrobial activity against a variety of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and fungal species.
TI  - Genome-wide RNA interference in Drosophila cells identifies G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 as a conserved regulator of NF-kappaB signaling.
AB  - Because NF-kappaB signaling pathways are highly conserved in evolution, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster provides a good model to study these cascades. We carried out an RNA interference (RNAi)-based genome-wide in vitro reporter assay screen in Drosophila for components of NF-kappaB pathways. We analyzed 16,025 dsRNA-treatments and identified 10 novel NF-kappaB regulators. Of these, nine dsRNA-treatments affect primarily the Toll pathway. G protein-coupled receptor kinase (Gprk)2, CG15737/Toll pathway activation mediating protein, and u-shaped were required for normal Drosomycin response in vivo. Interaction studies revealed that Gprk2 interacts with the Drosophila IkappaB homolog Cactus, but is not required in Cactus degradation, indicating a novel mechanism for NF-kappaB regulation. Morpholino silencing of the zebrafish ortholog of Gprk2 in fish embryos caused impaired cytokine expression after Escherichia coli infection, indicating a conserved role in NF-kappaB signaling. Moreover, small interfering RNA silencing of the human ortholog GRK5 in HeLa cells impaired NF-kappaB reporter activity. Gprk2 RNAi flies are susceptible to infection with Enterococcus faecalis and Gprk2 RNAi rescues Toll(10b)-induced blood cell activation in Drosophila larvae in vivo. We conclude that Gprk2/GRK5 has an evolutionarily conserved role in regulating NF-kappaB signaling.
TI  - Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma activation is required for maintenance of innate antimicrobial immunity in the colon.
AB  - Crohn's disease (CD), a major form of human inflammatory bowel disease, is characterized by primary immunodeficiencies. The nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) is essential for intestinal homeostasis in response to both dietary- and microbiota-derived signals. Its role in host defense remains unknown, however. We show that PPARgamma functions as an antimicrobial factor by maintaining constitutive epithelial expression of a subset of beta-defensin in the colon, which includes mDefB10 in mice and DEFB1 in humans. Colonic mucosa of Ppargamma mutant animals shows defective killing of several major components of the intestinal microbiota, including Candida albicans, Bacteroides fragilis, Enterococcus faecalis, and Escherichia coli. Neutralization of the colicidal activity using an anti-mDefB10 blocking antibody was effective in a PPARgamma-dependent manner. A functional promoter variant that is required for DEFB1 expression confers strong protection against Crohn's colitis and ileocolitis (odds ratio, 0.559; P = 0.018). Consistently, colonic involvement in CD is specifically linked to reduced expression of DEFB1 independent of inflammation. These findings support the development of PPARgamma-targeting therapeutic and/or nutritional approaches to prevent colonic inflammation by restoring antimicrobial immunity in CD.
TI  - Photocatalytic inactivation of E. faecalis in secondary wastewater plant effluents.
AB  - Photocatalytic inactivation of Enterococcus faecalis using TiO(2) suspensions was investigated and compared to the inactivation of the most commonly used faecal indicator strain Escherichia coli. In contrast to the inactivation in pure deionized water, disinfection of effluents from the biological process of an urban wastewater plant showed a longer initial lag phase and higher survival fractions after several hours of irradiation. Moreover, the fluctuation of the composition of the effluents strongly affects the overall inactivation rate, not directly related to changes in the values of organic matter content. Additionally, it was found that E. faecalis seems to be more resistant than E.coli towards the photocatalytic treatment. These results could be related to the differences in the cell wall structure of both microorganisms. The main conclusion of this work is that attention must be paid when transferring results obtained for model organism to real bacteria consortia and from laboratory experiments with deionized water to effluents from sewage plants.
TI  - [Characteristics of urinary tract infections in different patient subpopulations  and depending on the bladder emptying system].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: To analyze the prevalence and etiology of urinary tract infection in patients with neurogenic bladder depending on the bladder emptying system used as compared to a population with no neurological impairment. To assess perception of urinary tract infection by patients with neurogenic bladder. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An epidemiological and prospective study was conducted on 283 patients, in whom a total of 283 urethral cultures were performed. Of these, 106 came from patients with neurological damage, 28 from a control group with no neurological impairment, 74 from patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of our hospital, and 75 from patients who attended the emergency room for symptoms of acute urinary tract infection. The sensitivity and specificity of patient perception as indicative of urinary tract infection was analyzed using ROC curves. RESULTS: Positive urethral cultures were found in 66% of patients with neurological damage and 25% of control patients. Within the neurological group, patients with the highest rates of positive urethral cultures were those with myelomeningocele (MMC) (81.5%) and spinal cord injuries (71.7%), with a statistically significant difference (p=0.01). The microorganism most commonly found in all subgroups was Escherichia coli, followed by Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the neurological subgroup, Enterococcus faecalis and Proteus mirabilis in the control subgroup, and Klebsiella pneumoniae and Staphylococcus agalactiae in the emergency room subgroup. In the ICU subgroup, the most commonly found microorganism was Enterococcus faecalis, followed by Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Sensitivity for perception by neurological patients as an indication of the presence of urinary tract infection was 97.2%, as compared to 80% in the control group. Specificity was low in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: E. coli was the microorganism found in positive urethral cultures from all subgroups, except in the ICU group. The groups with the highest urinary tract infection rates were patients with MMC and spinal cord injuries. Sensitivity and specificity (as measured using ROC curves) for perception by neurological patients as an indication of the presence of urinary tract infection was higher in neurological patients than in the non-neurological control group (p=0.0004, area: 0.643).
TI  - Isolation, phylogenetic analysis and anti-infective activity screening of marine  sponge-associated actinomycetes.
AB  - Terrestrial actinomycetes are noteworthy producers of a multitude of antibiotics, however the marine representatives are much less studied in this regard. In this study, 90 actinomycetes were isolated from 11 different species of marine sponges that had been collected from offshore Ras Mohamed (Egypt) and from Rovinj (Croatia). Phylogenetic characterization of the isolates based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing supported their assignment to 18 different actinomycete genera representing seven different suborders. Fourteen putatively novel species were identified based on sequence similarity values below 98.2% to other strains in the NCBI database. A putative new genus related to Rubrobacter was isolated on M1 agar that had been amended with sponge extract, thus highlighting the need for innovative cultivation protocols. Testing for anti-infective activities was performed against clinically relevant, Gram-positive (Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus) and Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) bacteria, fungi (Candida albicans) and human parasites (Leishmania major, Trypanosoma brucei). Bioactivities against these pathogens were documented for 10 actinomycete isolates. These results show a high diversity of actinomycetes associated with marine sponges as well as highlight their potential to produce anti-infective agents.
TI  - Evaluation of efflux activity of bacteria by a semi-automated fluorometric system.
AB  - A semi-automated method that uses the common efflux pump (EP) substrate ethidium  bromide (EB) is described for the assessment of EP systems of bacteria. The method employs the Rotor-Gene(TM) 3000 thermocycler (Corbett Research) for the real-time assessment of accumulation and efflux of EB in Phosphate-Buffered Solution (PBS) under varying physiological conditions, such as temperature, pH, presence and absence of the energy source, and presence of efflux pumps inhibitors (EPIs). The method is sufficiently sensitive to characterize intrinsic EP systems of reference strains, a prime necessity if there is a need for assessment of EP-mediated multi-drug resistance (MDR). The method has been successfully applied by us to characterize intrinsic and over-expressed EP systems of Escherichia coli, Salmonella Enteritidis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, and Mycobacterium smegmatis and Mycobacterium avium, suggesting that if the organism can be maintained in PBS, the system described may suffice for the evaluation and assessment of its EP system.
TI  - Potential airborne microbial hazards for workers on dairy and beef cattle farms in Egypt.
AB  - This study was conducted to determine the concentration and frequency distribution of certain airborne micro-organisms on cattle farms and their potential health hazards to farm workers. The samples (60 air samples and 240 hand and nasal swabs from cattle farm workers) were collected from ten cattle farms (five dairy barns and five beef sheds) located in the Sharkia Governorate of Egypt. Air samples were collected for microbiological examination in liquid media using an all-glass impinger whereas those for fungal examination were placed on agar plates using slit air samplers (aeroscopes). The results showed that the overall means of total culturable bacterial and fungal counts were lower in the air of dairy cattle barns than in beef cattle sheds. Identification of the isolated bacteria revealed the recovery of the following species (from dairy cattle barns versus beef cattle sheds): Staphylococcus epidermidis (26.7% vs 36.7%), S. saprophyticus (20% vs 33.3%), S. aureus (10% vs 16.7%), Enterococcus faecalis (23.3% vs 26.7%), Enterobacter agglomerans (23.3 vs 13.3%), Escherichia coli, (16.7% vs 26.7%), Klebsiella oxytoca, (10% vs 16.7%), K. pneumoniae (3.3% vs 0%), Proteus rettegri (6.7% vs 13.3%), P. mirabilis (10% vs 10%), P. vulgaris (3.3% vs 6.7%), Pseudomonas species (6.7% vs 16.7%), respectively). Mycological examination of air samples revealed the presence of Aspergillus fumigatus (46.7% vs 63.3%), A. niger (20% vs 36.7%), A. flavus (13.3% vs 26.7%), Penicillium citrinum (16.7% vs 23.3%), P. viridicatum (13.3% vs 6.7%), P. capsulatum (3.3% vs 0%), Cladosporium spp. (30% vs 56.7%), Alternaria spp. (13.3 vs 23.3%), Mucor spp. (6.7% vs 16.7%), Fusarium spp. (3.3% vs 10%), Absidia spp. (6.7% vs 10%), Curvilaria spp. (10% vs 3.3%), Rhizopus spp. (6.7% vs 13.3%), Scopulariopsis (3.3% vs 6.7%), Epicoccum spp. (0% vs 3.4%) and yeast (13.3% vs 20%), respectively. In addition, microbiological examinations of farm workers revealed heavy contamination of their hands and noses with most of the micro-organisms detected in the air of cattle farms. The results showed that potential airborne microbial risks in beef cattle sheds were greater than in dairies.
TI  - Arsenic removal from water using iron-impregnated granular activated carbon in the presence of bacteria.
AB  - This study investigated the adsorption of arsenite [As(III)] and arsenate [As(V)] to iron-impregnated granular activated carbon (Fe-GAC), focusing on the effects of bacteria on arsenic removal. Characteristics of Fe-GAC were analyzed using field emission scanning electron microscopy along with energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry. Batch experiments were performed under various experimental conditions to determine the adsorption of As(III) and As(V) to Fe-GAC in the absence and presence of bacteria (Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, or Bacillus subtilis). In addition, biosorption of As(III) and As(V) to bacteria was observed with batch experiments. Experimental results showed that Fe-GAC was characterized by mosaic-like deposition layers separated by interspacing on the surface. Iron impregnation increased the removal of As(III) and As(V) in GAC. Biosorption experiments indicated that a small amount of As(V) adsorbed to bacteria while no adsorption of As(III) was observed. This phenomenon can be attributed to interactions of anionic As(V) with positively-charged amine groups present on bacterial surfaces. Results also showed that the influence of bacteria on arsenic removal in Fe-GAC was not eminent in our experimental conditions even though bacteria could occupy surface adsorption sites on iron (hydr)oxides. This study demonstrated that hindrance effects of bacteria on arsenic adsorption to the surfaces of Fe-GAC were minimal.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Alpinia galanga (L) Willd crude extracts.
AB  - Methanol, acetone and diethyl ether extracts of Alpinia galanga have been evaluated against pathogens viz. Bacillus subtilis MTCC 2391, Enterobacter aerogene, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli MTCC 1563, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa MTCC 6642, Salmonella typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus epidermis using Agar well diffusion method. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of all the extracts were determined using the macrodilution method. Methanol extracts have shown excellent activity towards all the pathogens with MIC and MBC values ranging from 0.04-1.28 mg/ml and 0.08-2.56 mg/ml, respectively. The GC-MS analysis of methanol extracts have yielded compounds like 5-hydroxymethyl furfural (59.9%), benzyl alcohol (57.6%), 1,8 cineole (15.65%), methylcinnamate (9.4%), 3-phenyl-2-butanone (8.5%) and 1,2 benzenedicarboxylic acid (8.9%), which could be responsible for its broad spectrum activity. So, A. galanga can be quite resourceful for the development of new generation drugs.
TI  - Azinyl sulfides--CXVIII. Antimicrobial activity of novel 1-methyl-3-thio-4-aminoquinolinium salts.
AB  - Synthesis and antimicrobial activity of novel 1-methyl-3-alkylthio-4-aminoquinolinium salts 2 and 1-methyl-3-acylthio-4-aminoquinolinium salts 4 are described. Compounds 2 were obtained by reacting 1-methyl-3,4-(dimethylthio)quinolinium chloride 1 with amines and by reacting 1-methyl-4-aminoquinolinium-3-thiolates 3 with alkylating agents. Compounds 4 were obtained by the reaction of 1-methyl-4-aminoquinolinium-3-thiolates 3 with acylating agents. Antimicrobial activity of compounds 2 and 4 was determined using G+ (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis) and G(-) (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) strains as well as Candida albicans yeast. The compounds show greatest activity against S. aureus whereas the lowest against P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Antibacterial Activity of Medicinal Plants Against Pathogens causing Complicated  Urinary Tract Infections.
AB  - Seventeen Indian folklore medicinal plants were investigated to evaluate antibacterial activity of aqueous, ethanol and acetone extracts against 66 multidrug resistant isolates of major urinary tract pathogens (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus faecalis) by disc diffusion method. Ethanol extract of Zingiber officinale and Punica granatum showed strong antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli. Ethanol extracts of Terminalia chebula and Ocimum sanctum exhibited antibacterial activity against Klebsiella pneumoniae. Ethanol extract of Cinnamomum cassia showed maximum antibacterial activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa while ethanol extract of Azadirachta indica and Ocimum sanctum exhibited antibacterial activity against Enterococcus faecalis. The results support the folkloric use of these plants in the treatment of urinary tract infections by the tribals of Mahakoshal region of central India.
TI  - Essential oil from the underground parts of Laserpitium zernyi: potential source  of alpha-bisabolol and its antimicrobial activity.
AB  - The composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oil from the underground parts (roots and rhizomes) of Laserpitium zernyi Hayek (Apiaceae) were investigated. The pale blue essential oil, obtained by hydrodistillation, was analyzed by GC and GC-MS. Forty-three compounds were identified (94.3% of total oil). The main constituent, beside alpha-pinene (31.6%) was alpha-bisabolol (30.9%), so this oil may be a novel potential natural source of this sesquiterpene alcohol. The antimicrobial activity was tested using the microdilution method against Gram (+) bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Micrococcus luteus, Enterococcus faecalis), Gram (-) bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli), and two strains of yeast (Candida albicans). L. zernyi oil showed significant antibacterial activity against S. epidermidis, S. aureus and M. luteus, but lower activities against the other tested strains.
TI  - Sewage sludge and liquid pig manure as possible sources of antibiotic resistant bacteria.
AB  - Within the last decades, the environmental spread of antibiotic resistant bacteria has become a topic of concern. In this study, liquid pig manure (n=305) and sewage sludge (n=111) - used as agricultural fertilizers between 2002 and 2005 - were investigated for the presence of Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium. Bacteria were tested for their resistance against 40 chemotherapeutics including several "reserve drugs". E. coli (n=613) from pig manure were at a significantly higher degree resistant to streptomycin, doxycycline, spectinomycin, cotrimoxazole, and chloramphenicol than E. coli (n=116) from sewage sludge. Enterococci (Ent. faecalis, n=387, and Ent. faecium, n=183) from pig manure were significantly more often resistant to high levels of doxycycline, rifampicin, erythromycin, and streptomycin than Ent. faecalis (n=44) and Ent. faecium (n=125) from sewage sludge. Significant differences in enterococcal resistance were also seen for tylosin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin high level, fosfomycin, clindamicin, enrofloxacin, moxifloxacin, nitrofurantoin, and quinupristin/dalfopristin. By contrast, aminopenicillins were more effective in enterococci from pig manure, and mean MIC-values of piperacillin+tazobactam and third generation cefalosporines were significantly lower in E. coli from pig manure than in E. coli from sewage sludge. 13.4% (E. coli) to 25.3% (Ent. faecium) of pig manure isolates were high-level multiresistant to substances from more than three different classes of antimicrobial agents. In sewage sludge, high-level-multiresistance reached from 0% (Ent. faecalis) to 16% (Ent. faecium). High rates of (multi-) resistant bacteria in pig manure emphasize the need for a prudent - cautious - use of antibiotics in farm animals.
TI  - Endodontic photoactivated disinfection using a conventional light source: an in vitro and ex vivo study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The antimicrobial effect of photoactivated disinfection (PAD) using toluidine blue and an LED lamp was tested on endodontic pathogens in planktonic suspension and after inoculation into extracted teeth. Irradiation time was limited to 30 seconds. STUDY DESIGN: The effect of PAD on planktonic suspensions of Escherichia coli, Candida albicans, Enterococcus faecalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Streptococcus intermedius was analyzed using Poisson regression. Moreover, cultures of S. intermedius were inoculated into prepared root canals of extracted molars. The effect of PAD performed immediately after inoculation or after overnight bacterial incubation was determined by a 2-sample t test. RESULTS: Photoactivated disinfection yielded significant reductions (P < .001) in the viable counts of all organisms in planktonic suspension. The PAD treatment of S. intermedius in root canals yielded a mean log10 reduction of 2.60 (P < .001) immediately after inoculation and of 1.38 (P < .001) after overnight incubation. CONCLUSION: Photoactivated disinfection using a conventional light source strongly reduces the number of viable endodontic pathogens in planktonic suspension and in root canals.
TI  - Antimicrobial and antimalarial activity of Cussonia species (Araliaceae).
AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Cussonia species are used in African traditional  medicine mainly against pain, inflammation, gastro-intestinal problems, malaria and sexually transmitted diseases. AIM OF THE STUDY: To summarise ethnomedicinal uses of Cussonia and to find scientific evidence in support of selected main uses. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) method, leaves of 13 Cussonia species, Schefflera umbellifera and Seemannaralia gerrardii were tested against pathogens associated with diarrhoea (Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli), sexually transmitted infections (Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Trichomonas vaginalis) and general infectious diseases (Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Antimalarial sensitivity was studied using Plasmodium falciparum and the [(3)H]-hypoxanthine incorporation assay. Cytotoxic effects on a T-cell leukaemia (Jurkat) cell line were determined using the tetrazolium-based cellular toxicity assay. RESULTS: Methanolic extracts were active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC of 1.0-1.5 mg/mL), Trichomonas vaginalis (MIC of 0.8-1.3 mg/mL) and Staphylococcus aureus (Cussonia arborea, 1.8 mg/mL). All samples were active against Neisseria gonorrhoeae (MIC of 0.02-0.7 mg/mL). The methanol extract of Cussonia arborea was the most active against Plasmodium falciparum (13.68 microg/mL) and showed anticancer properties (5.60 microg/mL). CONCLUSIONS: The traditional use of Cussonia species to treat sexually transmitted diseases and Plasmodium infections appears to have a scientific basis.
TI  - Biofilms in chronic bacterial prostatitis (NIH-II) and in prostatic calcifications.
AB  - The prevalence of inflammatory conditions of the prostate gland is increasing. In Italy, there is a high incidence of prostatitis (13.3%), also accompanied by prostatic calcifications. Cat NIH-II chronic bacterial prostatitis (CBPs) are the most frequent. Their aetiology theoretically involves the whole range of bacterial species that are able to form biofilms and infect prostate cells. The aim of our study was to isolate potential biofilm-producing bacteria from CBP patients, to evaluate their ability to produce in vitro biofilms, and to characterize intraprostatic bacteria and prostatic calcifications using scanning electron microscopy. The 150 clinical bacterial strains isolated from chronic prostatitis NIH-II patients were: 50 Enterococcus faecalis; 50 Staphylococcus spp.; 30 Escherichia coli; 20 gram-negative miscellanea. Quantitative assay of biofilm production and adhesion was performed according to the classic Christensen microwell assay. Isolates were classified as nonproducers, weak, moderate or strong producers. The majority of E. coli, gram-negative bacteria, Staphylococci and Enterococci strains were strong or medium producers: 63-30%, 75-15%, 46-36%, and 58-14%, respectively. Prostatic calcifications consisted of bacteria-like forms similar to the species isolated from biological materials and calcifications of patients. Our study proves, for the first time, that bacterial strains able to produce biofilms consistently are present in CBP. Additionally, prostatic calcifications are biofilm-related.
TI  - Probiotic treatment of irritable bowel syndrome in children.
AB  - Treatment of functional bowel disorders of irritable bowel-type (IBS) in children remains a difficult task because of a lack of drugs with low adverse event profile. We here report the results of a treatment study in 203 children (66 boys and 137 girls) age 4 to 18 years (mean: 10.5+/-4.5 years) with typical IBS symptoms with abdominal pain and either predominant diarrhea (n=50), constipation (n=56), alternating stool frequency (n=28) or unspecific pain (n=69). The average duration of symptoms prior to therapy was 175 days. Most (95%) patients up to age 11 were treated with a daily dose of 10 drops of Symbioflor 2 (SF2) (SymbioPharm, Herborn) (cells and autolysate of 1.5-4.5x10(7) CFU of bacteria of Escherichia coli type), in the elder children 77% received this dosage, while the remaining received a higher dose up to 30 drops/day. Treatment lasted 43 days on average. RESULTS: All patients tolerated the treatment well and without adverse events. The key IBS symptoms (abdominal pain, stool frequency) as well as the other symptoms (bloating, mucous and blood in stool, need for straining at stools, urge to defecate) improved significantly during treatment. Global assessment of therapy by parents and doctors was altogether positive. In summary these data confirm efficacy and tolerability of this probiotic compound in children and adolescents and supplement published data of probiotic IBS therapy in adults.
TI  - Microbiological outcome of complicated urinary tract infections treated with levofloxacin: a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analysis.
AB  - The pharmacodynamic targets representing 90% probability thresholds for bacterial eradication were determined in patients with complicated urinary tract infections (UTIs) treated with 500mg of levofloxacin every 24h for 7-14 days. Of 241 pre-treatment strains from 156 patients, 21 strains persisted after treatment. In each patient, plasma concentrations of levofloxacin were simulated based on population pharmacokinetic parameters and patient-specific data. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of levofloxacin for the pre-treatment strains determined in our previous study were used. The pharmacodynamic targets representing 90% probability thresholds for bacterial eradication were determined by logistic regression analyses. For all the isolates, Gram-negative bacilli, Gram-positive cocci, Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis, the target values of the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC)/MIC were 14.65, 31.46, 4.85, 43.00 and 3.06, respectively, and the targets of the maximum plasma concentration (C(max))/MIC were 1.22, 2.74, 0.39, 3.61 and 0.25, respectively. Such thresholds of AUC/MIC and C(max)/MIC in complicated UTIs would be lower than those in infections of other sites. In particular, the C(max)/MIC thresholds for Gram-positive cocci and E. faecalis were <1. These findings suggested that, in addition to its plasma concentration, the high concentration of levofloxacin in the urine might play a role in eradicating bacteria.
TI  - In vitro activity of tigecycline against patient isolates collected during phase  3 clinical trials for diabetic foot infections.
AB  - The in vitro activity of tigecycline and comparative antimicrobial agents was evaluated against 1828 primary baseline pathogens isolated from 844 patients enrolled in the phase 3 clinical trials investigating the efficacy of tigecycline in diabetic foot infection (DFI). The trials were global, enrolling patients in 30 countries. Tigecycline was active against the most prevalent pathogens in DFI, including Gram-positive and Gram-negative isolates of both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria with 95% of MICs < or =2 microg/mL for the entire collection. The spectrum of activity of tigecycline included important pathogens for DFI, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Bacteroides fragilis. As reported previously, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and several pathogens in the Proteeae group were generally less susceptible to tigecycline by comparison to other Gram-negative pathogens. The excellent in vitro expanded broad-spectrum activity of tigecycline in the clinical isolates confirmed the potential utility of tigecycline for pathogens associated with DFIs.
TI  - Photoantimicrobials as a potential local approach to geriatric UTIs.
AB  - AIMS: To test the efficacy of acceptable photoantimicrobial agents against bacterial pathogens implicated in complicated urinary tract infection (UTI) in comparison with conventionally employed antibacterials. METHODS AND RESULTS: Toluidine blue (TB), methylene blue (MB), 5-aminolaevulinic acid (ALA), trimethoprim and levofloxacin were employed in the study against the typical UTI-implicated pathogens Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis and Proteus mirabilis. Standard bacterial cell culture was used to assay the activity both in the dark and under 660-nm LED-illuminated conditions. TB and MB were highly photoactive across the range and exhibited rapid kill rates, their effects being assayed after 20-min illumination, rather than the 18-h incubation employed with the other compounds. Trimethoprim was inactive against all bacteria except Pr. mirabilis, while levofloxacin maintained highly bactericidal activity throughout. ALA required high concentrations for effective action but, for porphyrin production in situ, also required an 18-h incubation. CONCLUSIONS: TB and MB were highly and rapidly photobactericidal in comparison with the remaining agents tested. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Ubiquitous catheterization of geriatric patients offers a portal for light delivery to the urinary tract. The photoantimicrobial approach thus offers considerable potential.
TI  - Phenolics and anthocyanins in berries of European cranberry and their antimicrobial activity.
AB  - European cranberry is a berry plant rich in biologically active substances, making it valued by both the phyto-pharmaceutical and food industries. The aim of this study was to examine the accumulation of phenolic compounds and anthocyanins in berries of European cranberry and to assess their antibacterial activity. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Different wild clones of European cranberry were investigated according to berry weight and the amounts of total phenolics and anthocyanins. Anthocyanin profiles of extracts were evaluated by HPLC, whereas the antimicrobial properties were determined by the agar well diffusion method. A strong negative correlation between berry weight and the amount of anthocyanins was found. The amount of total phenolics among different cranberry clones in the field collection ranged from 224.0 mg/100 g to 498.0 mg/100 g, and the amount of total anthocyanins ranged from 40.7 mg/100 g to 207.3 mg/100 g. Quantitative HPLC-UV analysis revealed six anthocyanins in the berries of European cranberry, among which the anthocyanin peonidin-3-galactoside was most prevalent. CONCLUSIONS: Investigation of the antimicrobial properties showed that European cranberry extracts inhibited the growth of wide range of human pathogenic bacteria, both gram-negative (Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium) and gram-positive (Enterococcus faecalis, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacillus subtilis).
TI  - Abundance of type I toxin-antitoxin systems in bacteria: searches for new candidates and discovery of novel families.
AB  - Small, hydrophobic proteins whose synthesis is repressed by small RNAs (sRNAs), denoted type I toxin-antitoxin modules, were first discovered on plasmids where they regulate plasmid stability, but were subsequently found on a few bacterial chromosomes. We used exhaustive PSI-BLAST and TBLASTN searches across 774 bacterial genomes to identify homologs of known type I toxins. These searches substantially expanded the collection of predicted type I toxins, revealed homology of the Ldr and Fst toxins, and suggested that type I toxin-antitoxin loci are not spread by horizontal gene transfer. To discover novel type I toxin-antitoxin systems, we developed a set of search parameters based on characteristics of known loci including the presence of tandem repeats and clusters of charged and bulky amino acids at the C-termini of short proteins containing predicted transmembrane regions. We detected sRNAs for three predicted toxins from enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis, and showed that two of the respective proteins indeed are toxic when overexpressed. We also demonstrated that the local free-energy minima of RNA folding can be used to detect the positions of the sRNA genes. Our results suggest that type I toxin-antitoxin modules are much more widely distributed among bacteria than previously appreciated.
TI  - Conservative management of mesh-site infection in hernia repair.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mesh hernioplasty is the preferred surgical procedure for large abdominal wall hernias. Infection remains one of the most challenging complications of this operation. Salvaging infected prosthetic material after ventral hernia repair is rarely successful. Most cases require mesh excision and complex abdominal wall reconstruction, with variable success rates. In this article, we report 3 cases of mesh salvage after laparoscopic ventral herniorrhapy with a novel use of percutaneous drainage and antibiotic irrigation. RESULTS: Three patients developed infected seromas after laparoscopic ventral hernia repair. The fascial defect of the first patient was repaired with a commercially available 20 x 18 cm polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) mesh. A complex fluid collection developed the following month in the anterior abdominal wall overlying the patient's mesh. The cultures grew Staphylococcus aureus. The second patient had a 30 x 20 cm PTFE mesh placed, which developed a fluid collection with Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli. The third case underwent repair, using a another commercially available 22 x 28 cm PTFE mesh. A fluid collection measuring 20 x 10 cm in the anterior abdominal wall developed, growing Staphylococcus lugdunensis. In all 3 cases, a percutaneous drain was placed within the fluid collection and long-term intravenous (i.v.) access was obtained. I.v. antibiotics were initiated. In addition, gentamicin (80 mg) with 20 mL of saline was infused through the drain 3 times a day. All patients have remained free of clinical signs of infection following the completion of therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Infected mesh after laparoscopic ventral herniorrhapy without systemic sepsis may be amenable to nonoperative treatment. A conservative approach that includes percutaneous drainage followed by antibiotic irrigation is a potential alternative to prosthetic removal in carefully selected patients. Further evaluation of this technique is warranted to define the most appropriate management strategies for these patients.
TI  - Salmonella: the forgotten pathogen: health hazards of compliance with European bathing water legislation.
AB  - The increasing demands on recreational waters have made microbial contamination a matter of public and scientific concern. This study aimed to search for Salmonella spp. in waters classified according EU Directive 2006/7/EC, in order to assess associations between its prevalence and the concentration of the non-pathogenic new faecal indicators: Escherichia coli and intestinal enterococci. Although a statistically significant association was observed Salmonella was detected on beaches classified as "Good" (9.3%) and "Excellent" (14.4%) which compromises the idea that faecal indicators can be predictors of pathogens. Attending the high prevalence of Salmonella found (23.1%) it seemed important to improve the efficiency of the conventional analytical method (ISO 6340:1995), comparing its draft with SML-VIDAS Salmonella and two new chromogenic media: AES Salmonella Agar Plate (ASAP) and Simple Method Salmonella (SMS). ASAP showed the higher efficiency and can be recommended for a faster detection and presumptive identification of salmonellae in bathing waters.
TI  - Chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oils from several Hypericum taxa (Guttiferae) growing in central Italy (Appennino Umbro-Marchigiano).
AB  - The chemical composition of the essential oils of nine taxa from seven sections of Hypericum L. (Guttiferae; H. perforatum subsp. perforatum, H. perforatum subsp. veronense, H. calycinum, H. montanum, H. richeri subsp. richeri, H. hyssopifolium, H. hirsutum, H. hircinum subsp. majus, and H. tetrapterum) occurring in central Italy (Appennino Umbro-Marchigiano) was analyzed by GC/FID and GC/MS. A total of 186 compounds were identified in the different species and subspecies, accounting for 86.9-92.8% of the total oils. The major fraction of the oil was always represented by sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (30.3-77.2%), while quantitative differences occurred between the other classes of volatiles depending on the taxa considered. Chemical composition of the nine Hypericum entities with respect to the taxonomical classification was discussed. Essential oils obtained from six taxa, i.e., H. perforatum subsp. perforatum, H. perforatum subsp. veronense, H. calycinum, H. richeri subsp. richeri, H. hirsutum and H. tetrapterum, were also tested for their antimicrobial properties against five different microbial strains by the broth-microdilution method, and they were found to have significant activity (expressed as MIC) on B. subtilis, moderate activity on C. albicans and S. aureus, and weak activity on E. coli and E. faecalis, the most active being those from H. hirsutum, H. richeri subsp. richeri, and H. tetrapterum.
TI  - Pt(II) and Ag(I) complexes with acesulfame: crystal structure and a study of their antitumoral, antimicrobial and antiviral activities.
AB  - Two new complexes of platinum(II) and silver(I) with acesulfame were synthesized. Acesulfame is in the anionic form acesulfamate (ace). The structures of both complexes were determined by X-ray crystallography. For K(2)[PtCl(2)(ace)(2)] the platinum atom is coordinated to two Cl(-) and two N-acesulfamate atoms forming a trans-square planar geometry. Each K(+) ion interacts with two oxygen atoms of the S(O)(2) group of each acesulfamate. For the polymeric complex [Ag(ace)](n) the water molecule bridges between two crystallographic equivalent Ag1 atoms which are related each other by a twofold symmetry axis. Two Ag1 atoms, related to each other by a symmetry centre, make bond contact with two equivalent oxygen atoms. These bonds give rise to infinite chains along the unit cell diagonal in the ac plane. The in vitro cytotoxic analyses for the platinum complex using HeLa (human cervix cancer) cells show its low activity when compared to the vehicle-treated cells. The Ag(I) complex submitted to in vitro antimycobacterial tests, using the Microplate Alamar Blue (MABA) method, showed a good activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, responsible for tuberculosis, with a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) value of 11.6microM. The Ag(I) complex also presented a promising activity against Gram negative (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and Gram positive (Enterococcus faecalis) microorganisms. The complex K(2)[PtCl(2)(ace)(2)] was also evaluated for antiviral properties against dengue virus type 2 (New Guinea C strain) in Vero cells and showed a good inhibition of dengue virus type 2 (New Guinea C strain) replication at 200microM, when compared to vehicle-treated cells.
TI  - In vitro activity of tigecycline against patient isolates collected during phase  3 clinical trials for hospital acquired pneumonia.
AB  - The in vitro activity of tigecycline was evaluated against 819 baseline pathogens isolated from 383 patients enrolled in the phase 3 clinical trial investigating the efficacy of tigecycline in hospital acquired pneumonia (HAP). The trials were global, enrolling patients in 27 countries. Tigecycline was active against the most prevalent pathogens in HAP, including gram-positive and gram-negative strains (90% of MICs </=2 microg/mL for the entire collection). The spectrum of activity of tigecycline included important pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant S. aureus), Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii/calcoaceticus complex, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, and Enterobacter cloacae. As reported previously, a few genera, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the Proteeae, were generally less susceptible to tigecycline by comparison to other gram-negative pathogens. The excellent in vitro, expanded, broad-spectrum activity of tigecycline in the clinical isolates confirmed the potential utility of tigecycline for pathogens associated with with hospital acquired pneumonia infections.
TI  - Inhibition of sodium hypochlorite antimicrobial activity in the presence of bovine serum albumin.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: This study investigated the inhibition of the antimicrobial activity of sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) by bovine serum albumin (BSA). The killing of Enterococcus faecalis, Candida albicans, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Escherichia coli by NaOCl in concentrations from 2% to 0.03% was measured in the presence of BSA in concentrations between 6.7% and 0.1%. METHODS: NaOCl, BSA, and microorganism suspensions were mixed, and, after 30 seconds, 6 minutes, and 30 minutes, samples were taken and NaOCl was inactivated by 5% sodium thiosulphate. The microbes were incubated in tryptic soy broth broth for up to 7 days for the detection of growth. RESULTS: All microorganisms were killed within 30 seconds by 0.03% NaOCl when BSA was not present. High concentrations of BSA significantly reduced the antimicrobial activity of NaOCl against the four species. CONCLUSIONS: The inhibition of sodium hypochlorite by BSA was directly dependent on their quantitative relationships. The result partly explains the poorer performance in vivo of NaOCl as compared to in vitro experiments.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Artemisia nilagirica leaf extracts against clinical and phytopathogenic bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The six organic solvent extracts of Artemisia nilagirica were screened for the potential antimicrobial activity against phytopathogens and clinically important standard reference bacterial strains. METHODS: The agar disk diffusion method was used to study the antibacterial activity of A. nilagirica extracts against 15 bacterial strains. The Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of the plant extracts were tested using two fold agar dilution method at concentrations ranging from 32 to 512 microg/ml. The phytochemical screening of extracts was carried out for major phytochemical derivatives in A. nilagirica. RESULTS: All the extracts showed inhibitory activity for gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria except for Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus. The hexane extract was found to be effective against all phytopathogens with low MIC of 32 microg/ml and the methanol extract exhibited a higher inhibition activity against Escherichia coli, Yersinia enterocolitica, Salmonella typhi, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (32 microg/ml), Bacillus subtilis (64 microg/ml) and Shigella flaxneri (128 microg/ml). The phytochemical screening of extracts answered for the major derivative of alkaloids, amino acids, flavonoids, phenol, quinines, tannins and terpenoids. CONCLUSION: All the extracts showed antibacterial activity against the tested strains. Of all, methanol and hexane extracts showed high inhibition against clinical and phytopathogens, respectively. The results also indicate the presence of major phytochemical derivatives in the A. nilagirica extracts. Hence, the isolation and purification of therapeutic potential compounds from A. nilagirica could be used as an effective source against bacterial diseases in human and plants.
TI  - [Investigation of antibacterial activity of sertralin].
AB  - Sertralin is a psychotropic drug which acts by inhibiting the selective serotonin re-uptake in the synaptic area. Previous studies have shown that some antidepressant agents have antibacterial activity. The aim of this study was to investigate the in vitro antibacterial activity of sertralin. A total of 224 bacterial strains isolated from clinical specimens together with standard control strains were included to the study. The antibacterial activity of sertralin was determined by microdilution method in Mueller-Hinton broth according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guideline. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values were found to be 4-32 microg/ml for 22 methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus strains, 16-32 microg/ml for 25 methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains, 8-32 microg/ml for 20 methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci strains, 16-32 microg/ml for 4 vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis strains, 0.5-32 microg/ml for 10 vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecium strains, 2-8 microg/ml for 12 vancomycin-resistant E. faecium strains, 16-128 microg/ml for 21 Acinetobacter baumannii strains, 4->128 microg/ml for 20 Klebsiella pneumoniae strains, 0.25-128 microg/ml for 24 Escherichia coil strains, 64->128 microg/ml for 22 Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, 128->128 microg/ml for 2 Proteus vulgaris strains, 64->128 microg/ml for 8 Proteus mirabilis strains, 32->128 microg/ml for 7 Stenotrophomonas maltophilia strains, 32-128 microg/ml for 21 Enterobacter cloacae strains and 8-128 microg/ml for 6 Enterobacter aerogenes strains. The MIC values of sertralin against standard strains were as follows; 16 microg/ml for S. aureus ATCC 29213 (methicillin-susceptible), 32 microg/ml for S. aureus ATCC 43300 (methicillin-resistant), 16 microg/ml for E. faecalis ATCC 29212, 32 microg/ml for K. pneumoniae ATCC 700603, 32 microg/ml for E. coli ATCC 25922 and > 128 microg/ml for P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853. Sertralin has showed antibacterial activity mainly against gram-positive bacteria, and it was surprising that MIC values of vancomycin-resistant enterococci were lower than those of vancomycin-susceptible ones. Further in vivo and in vitro studies are required to provide reliable data about the use of sertralin as an adjuvant agent in the antibacterial treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of root canal filling materials for primary teeth: zinc oxide and eugenol cement, Calen paste thickened with zinc oxide, Sealapex and EndoREZ.
AB  - This study evaluated in vitro the antibacterial activity of 4 root canal filling  materials for primary teeth - zinc oxide and eugenol cement (ZOE), Calen paste thickened with zinc oxide (Calen/ZO), Sealapex sealer and EndoREZ sealer - against 5 bacterial strains commonly found in endodontic infections (Kocuria rhizophila, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus mutans, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus) using the agar diffusion test (agar-well technique). Calen paste, 1% chlorhexidine digluconate (CHX) and distilled water served as controls. Seven wells per dish were made at equidistant points and immediately filled with the test and control materials. After incubation of the plates at 37 degrees C for 24 h, the diameter of the zones of bacterial growth inhibition produced around the wells was measured (in mm) with a digital caliper under reflected light. Data were analyzed statistically by analysis of variance and Tukey's post-hoc test (alpha=0.05). There were statistically significant differences (p<0.0001) among the zones of bacterial growth inhibition produced by the different materials against all target microorganisms. K. rhizophila was inhibited more effectively (p<0.05) by ZOE, while Calen/ZO had its highest antibacterial activity against E. faecalis (p<0.05). S. mutans was inhibited by Calen/ZO, Sealapex and ZOE in the same intensity (p>0.05). E. coli was inhibited more effectively (p<0.05) by ZOE, followed by Calen/ZO and Sealapex. Calen/ZO and ZOE were equally effective (p>0.05) against S. aureus, while Sealapex had the lowest antibacterial efficacy (p<0.05) against this microorganism. EndoREZ presented antibacterial activity only against K. rhizophila and S. aureus. The Calen paste and Calen/ZO produced larger zones of inhibition than 1% CHX when the marker microorganism was E faecalis. In conclusion, the in vitro antibacterial activity of the 4 root canal filling materials for primary teeth against bacterial strains commonly found in endodontic infections can be presented in a decreasing order of efficacy as follows: ZOE>Calen/ZO>Sealapex>EndoREZ.
TI  - Antibacterial effect of NSAIDS on clinical isolates of urinary tract infection and diabetic foot infection.
AB  - Non Steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDS) are a group of chemically dissimilar agents that have primary effect of inhibition of prostaglandin's synthesis. Aspirin (Acetyl Salicylic Acid) is used as an analgesic, anti pyretic, anti-inflammatory agent and also have an anticoagulant effect. Tylenol (acetaminophen) is used as pain reliever. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of Aspirin and Tylenol against clinical isolates of urinary tract infection (UTI) and diabetic foot infections. A total of 100 clinical isolates were analyzed. Out of these 50 were urine samples from diabetic patients with UTI and 50 pus samples from diabetic foot infection. Bacteriological study was done by inoculating urine samples on Cysteine Lactose Electrolyte deficient (CLED) media. Pus samples were inoculated on Blood agar and MacConkey's agar. Identification was done by colony characteristics, gram staining and standard biochemical tests and Quick Test Strip (QTS-20) DESTO Laboratories, Karachi. Antibacterial effect of Aspirin and Tylenol were tested against 100 clinical isolates by Replica plate method, Agar well diffusion method and tube dilution method. Concentrations of Aspirin and Tylenol (10 microg, 50 microg, 100 microg, 500 microg, 1000 microg) were made in Muller Hinton media. Bacteria isolated from urine samples were Escherichia coli 30%, Staphylococcus aureus 20%, Enterococcus faecalis 10%, S. saprophyticus 10%, Proteus spp. 6%, Pseudomonas spp. 6%, S. pyogenes 6%, S. agalactiae 6%, S. epidermidis 4%, and Klebsiella spp. 2%. Bacteria isolated from pus samples were S. aureus 30%, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 18%, S. epidermidis 14%, Klebsiella pneumonia 12%, Proteus mirabilis 12%, E. coli 10%, P. vulgaris 4%. Aspirin was effective at 100-500 microg concentration against all isolates. Tylenol has marked effect on pathogens at 100 microg concentration. Aspirin and Tylenol along with analgesic, anti-pyretic, anti-inflammatory properties also have marked anti bacterial effect on isolates from UTI and Diabetic foot infections and inhibits the growth of both gram negative and gram positive bacteria, and both can be used synergistically with antibiotics for effective treatment.
TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial activity of 5-ylidenethiazolidin-4-ones and 5-benzylidene-4,6-pyrimidinediones.
AB  - 5-benzylidenethiazolidin-4-ones and 5-benzylidenepyrimidine-4,6-diones (compounds 1-9), carrying 2,3,4-trifluoro or 3,4,5-trimethoxy groups on the benzylidene moiety, and rhodanine derivatives 10 and 11 were synthesized and assayed in vitro for their antimicrobial activity against four standard bacterial strains (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853). Compounds 1-3 and 9 that were active against S. aureus, were also tested against methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) ATCC 43300, Streptococcus pneumoniae ATCC 49619 and Streptococcus pyogenes ATCC 19615. (Z)-5-(2,3,4-Trifluorobenzylidene)rhodanine (1) inhibited the growth of S. aureus at 0.5 microg/mL and MRSA at 32 microg/mL. Stronger antimicrobial activity against S. aureus was observed for compounds bearing the rhodanine ring than those containing other heterocyclic moieties. Neither of the compounds 1-11 inhibited the growth of Gram-negative bacteria E. coli or P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Effect of probiotic bacterial strains of Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, and Enterococcus on enteroaggregative Escherichia coli.
AB  - The effects of nine probiotic strains of Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, and Enterococcus on the growth, adhesion activity, and biofilm formation of enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAggEC) were examined. The culture supernatant of the E. faecium strain, with or without pH adjustment to a neutral pH, had a strong bactericidal effect on EAggEC, including induction of membrane damage and cell lysis. Supernatants of the L. casei ss. casei and L. casei ss. rhamnosus strains also had a bactericidal effect on EAggEC, but this activity was abolished by pH adjustment to a neutral pH. No inhibitory effect of the culture supernatants of Bifidobacterium or E. faecalis strains was detected. Adhesion of EAggEC to intestinal epithelial cells was not inhibited by the bacterial strains tested. Two strains of L. casei enhanced EAggEC biofilm formation, which was characterized by increased bacterial proliferation. These results suggest that the three different bacterial species; Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, and Enterococcus, have different effects on EAggEC, and that further analysis is required for the practical use of these bacteria as probiotics against EAggEC infection.
TI  - [Antimicrobial treatment of nosocomial intra-abdominal infections--new treatment  options with tygecycline].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Nosocomial, intra-abdominal infections are extremely serious conditions, considering possibilities for their early diagnosis, as well as for their effective therapy. Multiresistant bacteria (Enterobacteriacae producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases - ESBL Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, vancomycin-resistant enterococci [VRE], and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [MRSA]) are frequently isolated as pathogens of these infections. Tygecycline is among the novel wide- spectrum antibiotics affecting multiresistant bacteria, which are being introduced in clinical practice. AIM: The aim of this study is to assess actual sensitivity of tygecycline to the commonest pathogens of intra-abdominal infections, generated in hospitalized surgical patients. Based on the sensitivity tests, tygecycline was indicated for targeted antibiotic therapy in intraabdominal infections. METHODS: Sensitivity to tygecycline, aminopenicillins, fluorochinoloni and gentamycine was established for the following bacteria: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonie, Enterobacter cloacea, Proteus mirabilis. Sensitivity to oxacillin, clincamycine and tygecycline was tested in Staphylococcus aureus, and to fluorochinolini, gentamycine and tygecycline in Enterococcus faecalis, and to fluorochinoloni, gentamycine, ceftazidime and gentamycine in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Based on the sensitivity results, tygecycline was administered in two patients with postsurgical intra-abdominal infections caused by ESBL Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumonie. The initital dose of tygecycline was 100 mg i.v., followed by tygecycline 50 mg i.v. every 12 hours for 7 days. RESULTS: The isolated bacteria showed 98-100% sensitivity to tygecycline, except Psudomonas aeruginosa, where 100% resistance was demonstrated. Targeted antimicrobial medication with tygecycline proved effective in postoperative nosocomial intra-abdominal infections, the both concerned patients recovered. CONCLUSION: The choice of antimicrobial medication in nosocomial intra-abdominal infections requires through evaluation considering various factors including prior antibiotic therapy, co-morbidities and the current status of sensitivity with respect to potential multiresistant pathogens. Tygecycline shows significant in vitro efficacy against resistant gram-positive and key gram-negative facultative bacteria, which are a common cause of intra-abdominal infections in surgery patients. Clinical experience has shown that tygecycline is safe and effective in the treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections.
TI  - The biocompatability of mesoporous inorganic-organic hybrid resin films with ionic and hydrophilic characteristics.
AB  - New mesoporous silicate-titania resin systems hybridized with 4,5-dihydroxy-m-benzenedisulfonic acid and poly(ethylene glycol)-dimethacrylate component were developed. These inorganic-organic hybrid resins were found to reveal highly controlled ionic and hydrophilic surface with excellent durability and adhesion onto various substrates. The resin films revealed high resistance to nonspecific adsorption of fibrinogen and to adherence by several bacterial pathogens such as Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis. Furthermore, excellent biocompatibility of the developed resins was proved by both HEp-2 cell adhesion in vitro and subcutaneous implantation in mice. The inorganic-organic hybrid resins are strongly promising for biomedical applications including biomedical devices and biosensors.
TI  - The lactococcin G immunity protein recognizes specific regions in both peptides constituting the two-peptide bacteriocin lactococcin G.
AB  - Lactococcin G and enterocin 1071 are two homologous two-peptide bacteriocins. Expression vectors containing the gene encoding the putative lactococcin G immunity protein (lagC) or the gene encoding the enterocin 1071 immunity protein (entI) were constructed and introduced into strains sensitive to one or both of the bacteriocins. Strains that were sensitive to lactococcin G became immune to lactococcin G when expressing the putative lactococcin G immunity protein, indicating that the lagC gene in fact encodes a protein involved in lactococcin G immunity. To determine which peptide or parts of the peptide(s) of each bacteriocin that are recognized by the cognate immunity protein, combinations of wild-type peptides and hybrid peptides from the two bacteriocins were assayed against strains expressing either of the two immunity proteins. The lactococcin G immunity protein rendered the enterococcus strain but not the lactococcus strains resistant to enterocin 1071, indicating that the functionality of the immunity protein depends on a cellular component. Moreover, regions important for recognition by the immunity protein were identified in both peptides (Lcn-alpha and Lcn-beta) constituting lactococcin G. These regions include the N-terminal end of Lcn-alpha (residues 1 to 13) and the C-terminal part of Lcn-beta (residues 14 to 24). According to a previously proposed structural model of lactococcin G, these regions will be positioned adjacent to each other in the transmembrane helix-helix structure, and the model thus accommodates the present results.
TI  - Diagnostic microarray for human and animal bacterial diseases and their virulence and antimicrobial resistance genes.
AB  - Rapid diagnosis and treatment of disease is often based on the identification and characterization of causative agents derived from phenotypic characteristics. Current methods can be laborious and time-consuming, often requiring many skilled personnel and a large amount of lab space. The objective of our study was to develop a spotted microarray for rapid identification and characterization of bacterial pathogens and their antimicrobial resistance genes. Our spotted microarray consists of 489 70mer probes that detect 40 bacterial pathogens of medical, veterinary and zoonotic importance (including 15 NIAID Category A, B and C pathogens); associated genes that encode resistance for antimicrobial and metal resistance; and DNA elements that are important for horizontal gene transfer among bacteria. High specificity and reliability of the microarray was achieved for bacterial pathogens of animal and human importance by validating MDR pathogenic bacteria as pure cultures or by following their inoculation in complex and highly organic sample matrices, such as soil and manure.
TI  - Susceptibility to tigecycline of isolates from samples collected in hospitalized  patients with secondary peritonitis undergoing surgery.
AB  - Activity of tigecycline against nosocomial secondary peritonitis isolates collected along 18 months in 29 Spanish hospitals was tested by Etest in a central laboratory, considering Food and Drug Administration (FDA)/British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy (BSAC)/European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) breakpoints. A total of 600 facultative/aerobic isolates (392 Gram negative, 208 Gram positive) and 100 anaerobes were tested. None of the 220 Escherichia coli isolates was resistant to tigecycline (MIC(50)/MIC(90) = 0.25/0.5 microg/mL), with 0.5% (FDA breakpoint) and 3.6% (BSAC/EUCAST breakpoint) intermediate strains. All Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing E. coli isolates (15 strains), all Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Klebsiella oxytoca isolates (42 strains) were susceptible to tigecycline. No isolates resistant to tigecycline were found among Streptococcus viridans, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecium, but 18.9% of Enterococcus faecalis strains were intermediate following BSAC/EUCAST breakpoints. All (but 1) isolates of the Bacteroides fragilis group (n = 45) were tigecycline susceptible, as well as Gram-positive anaerobes. Tigecycline offers an adequate activity profile against isolates from secondary peritonitis when tested by Etest regardless of the breakpoints used for categorization.
TI  - Detection of Leptospira in urine using anti-Leptospira-coated gold nanoparticles.
AB  - Serological assays for antibody detection have been widely used for Leptospirosis diagnosis. However, antibody is usually undetectable during the first week after infection. Detection of Leptospira DNA can be done by PCR but this technique requires special equipments and the cost is still relatively high. Here we demonstrate that gold nanoparticles can be used to facilitate Leptospira detection. Gold nanoparticles were coated with rabbit antibody specific to Leptospira interrogans serovar Bratislava and these coated particles were used to detect Leptospira in urine. Agglutination of gold particles indicated the presence of Leptospira in samples tested. The sensitivity of detection was 10 leptospires/ml. No agglutination was observed when anti-Leptospira-coated particles were tested with urine containing the organisms commonly found in urine such as Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis. This assay is very easy to perform and results could be observed with the naked eyes. Fresh or frozen urine samples could be used. The stability of antibody-coated particles was at least 2 months when kept at 4 degrees C. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the technique using antibody-coated gold nanoparticles is a promising tool for further validation as a rapid assay for Leptospirosis diagnosis.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of glutaraldehyde-like compounds from olive products.
AB  - The bactericidal effects of several olive compounds (nonenal, oleuropein, tyrosol, the dialdehydic form of decarboxymethyl elenolic acid either free [EDA] or linked to tyrosol [TyEDA] or to hydroxytyrosol [HyEDA]), other food phenolic compounds (catechin, epicatechin, eugenol, thymol, carvacrol, and carnosic acid), and commercial disinfectants (glutaraldehyde [GTA] and ortho-phthalaldehyde [OPA]), were tested against strains of Pseudomonas fluorescens, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Escherichia coli. It was found that the bactericidal activities of olive GTA-like compounds (EDA, HyEDA, and TyEDA) were greater than those exerted by several food phenolic substances. Surprisingly, these olive antimicrobials were as active as the synthetic biocides GTA and OPA against the four bacteria studied. Thus, it has been proposed that the bactericidal activity of the main olive antimicrobials is primarily due to their dialdehydic structure, which is similar to that of the commercial biocides GTA and OPA. Our results clearly reveal that olive GTA-like compounds possess a strong bactericidal activity even greater than that of other food phenolic compounds or synthetic biocides.
TI  - Effect of cranberry drink on bacterial adhesion in vitro and vaginal microbiota in healthy females.
AB  - INTRODUCTION/OBJECTIVE: Cranberries have been shown to produce urinary metabolites that influence uropathogen adhesion and prevent urinary tract infections. This study was designed to determine if consuming reconstituted, unsweetened cranberry drink from extract retained its bioactive properties by reducing uropathogen adhesion without adversely affecting urinary calcium, magnesium and the vaginal microflora. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A randomized crossover study was undertaken in 12 healthy women consuming reconstituted unsweetened cranberry drink, CranActin or water. The urine was collected at 4 hours and 1 week of consumption and evaluated for antiadhesive properties and urinary pH, calcium and magnesium. Vaginal swabs were collected after 1 week of treatment to assess the vaginal microbiota by DGGE. RESULTS: The resultant urine produced by subjects who consumed 500 ml reconstituted cranberry extract twice per day, significantly reduced the adherence to epithelial cells of P-fimbriated uropathogenic Escherichia coli and showed a tendency towards significance for two E. coli strains expressing fimbriae and an Enterococcus faecalis isolate. The cranberry drink treatment did not alter urinary pH, but reduced calcium and magnesium concentrations compared to water, although not to statistical significance. The reconstituted cranberry drink had no apparent detrimental effect on the vaginal microbiota. However, consuming twice daily resulted in an apparent loss of a potential pathogen from the vagina in 42% subjects. CONCLUSIONS: The present findings suggest that reconstituted cranberry drink may retain the ability to reduce the risk of UTI by inhibiting pathogen adhesion while not detrimentally affecting urinary pH or vaginal microbiota, or the risk of calculi.
TI  - Chemical composition and antibacterial activity of the essential oil of Monticalia andicola (Asteraceae) collected in Venezuela.
AB  - The essential oil from the leaves of Monticalia andicola Turcz., collected in November 2008, was analyzed by GC/MS. A yield of 0.15% oil was obtained by hydrodistillation. Thirty-six components were identified by comparison of their mass spectra with those in the Wiley GC-MS Library data base. The major components were alpha-pinene (19.6%), beta-pinene (10.5%), alpha-longipinene (6.5%), delta-3-carene (6.2%), cyperene (5.4%) and beta-phellandrene (5.2%). The antibacterial activity of the essential oil was evaluated against Gram- positive (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212) and Gram-negative (Escherichia coli ATCC 25992, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 23357, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853) bacteria, using the disc diffusion agar method. The results showed a broad spectrum of activity with minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values ranging from 10 to 150 microg/mL.
TI  - Cell lysis and DNA extraction of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria from whole blood in a disposable microfluidic chip.
AB  - Sepsis caused by gram positive and gram negative bacteria is the leading cause of death in noncoronary ICUs and the tenth leading cause of death in the United States. We have developed a microfluidic sample preparation platform for rapid on-chip detection of infectious organisms for point-of-care diagnostics. The microfluidic chips are made of a robust thermoplastic and can be easily multiplexed for high throughput applications. Bacteria are lysed on-chip via hybrid chemical/mechanical method. Once lysed, the bacterial DNA is isolated using a microscale silica bead/polymer composite solid-phase-extraction (SPE) column. Lysis was confirmed using off-chip real time PCR. We isolated and detected both gram-negative (Escherichia coli) and gram-positive (Bacillussubtilis and Enterococcus faecalis) bacterial genomic DNA from microliter scale spiked whole human blood samples. The system performs better for gram-negative bacteria than it does for gram-positive bacteria, with limits of detection at 10(2) CFU/ml and 10(3)-10(4) CFU/ml, respectively. Total extraction times are less than one hour and can be further decreased by altering the channel geometry and pumping configuration.
TI  - Benzoxazine series of histidine kinase inhibitors as potential antimicrobial agents with activity against enterococci.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antibacterial activity of three members of a benzoxazine series of histidine kinase inhibitors ( 4a , 4b and 6 ) was studied on standard strains, and with 4b also on clinical isolates of enterococci. METHODS: Susceptibility to each compound was tested using a broth macrodilution method with a range of dilutions from 0.016 to 128 microg/ml on four standard strains (Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213 and Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212) and in the case of 4b also on 52 clinical isolates of enterococci (7 vancomycin-susceptible E. faecalis, 15 vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecium and 30 vancomycin-resistant E. faecium), and on two additional standard strains (S. aureus ATCC 43300 and E. faecalis ATCC 51299). RESULTS: Neither of the compounds inhibited the growth of E. coli ATCC 25922 or P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853. Compound 4b inhibited the growth of S. aureus ATCC 29213 at 8 microg/ml, S. aureus ATCC 43300 at 32 microg/ml, E. faecalis ATCC 29212, and E. faecalis ATCC 51299 at 16 microg/ml, while 4a and 6 did so at higher concentrations. For clinical isolates of enterococci, the minimal inhibitory concentrations of 4b were in the range of 0.5-16 microg/ml. CONCLUSIONS: Compound 4b promises to be a potentially useful antimicrobial agent for vancomycin-susceptible and -resistant enterococci.
TI  - Photokilling of bacteria by curcumin in different aqueous preparations. Studies on curcumin and curcuminoids XXXVII.
AB  - Curcumin has potential as a photosensitiser (PS) in photodynamic therapy (PDT) for localised superficial infections. However, it is a challenge to make an optimal curcumin formulation in which curcumin has acceptable solubility and stability at physiological pH and combined with high selective phototoxic activity towards bacteria. In the present study, the phototoxic effects of curcumin against gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria were investigated in selected aqueous preparations. The gram-positive Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus intermedius and the gram-negative Escherichia coli were used as bacterial models. The bacteria were exposed to 1-25 microM curcumin solubilised in DMSO, cyclodextrines, liposomes and surfactants known to interfere with membranes. After 30 min incubation the bacteria were irradiated with fluorescent tubes emitting blue light (emission max 430 nm). The irradiance was 17 mW/cm2 and the radiant exposure (light dose) was 0.5-30J/cm2. The bacterial survival was calculated as a percentage compared to controls. Various post-irradiation incubation times were tested. Curcumin's native fluorescence was exploited in examination of curcumin uptake in or adherence to bacteria by fluorescence microscopy. Changes in post-irradiation incubation time, curcumin concentration, irradiation dose and preparation strongly influenced the phototoxic efficiency of curcumin in vitro. Aqueous preparations of DMSO, polyethyleneglycol and the pluronic block copolymer poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(propylene glycol)-block-poly(ethylene glycol) were the most efficient vehicles for curcumin to exert photokilling of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Monitoring bacterial indicators and pathogens in cattle feedlot waste by real-time PCR.
AB  - Quantitative microbial health risk assessment requires accurate enumeration of pathogens in hazard-containing matrices as part of the risk characterization process. As part of a risk management-oriented study of cattle feedlot waste contaminants, we investigated the utility of quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) for surveying the microbial constituents of different faecal wastes. The abundance of Escherichia coli and enterococci were first estimated in five cattle feedlot waste types from five localities. Bacteria were quantified using two culture methods and compared to the number of genome copies detected by qPCR targeted at E. coli and Enterococcus faecalis. Bacterial numbers detected in the different wastes (fresh faeces, pen manure, aged manure, composted manure, carcass manure compost) ranged from 10-(7) to 10(2)g(-1) (dry weight). Both indicator groups were detected by qPCR with a comparable sensitivity to culture methods across this range. qPCR measurements of E. coli and E. faecalis correlated well with MPN and spread plate data. As a second comparison, we inoculated green fluorescent protein (GFP) labeled reference bacteria into manure samples. GFP labeled E. coli and Listeria monocytogenes were detected by qPCR in concentrations corresponding to between 18% and 71% of the initial bacterial numbers, compared to only 2.5-16% by plating. Our results supported our selection of qPCR as a fast, accurate and reliable system for surveying the presence and abundance of pathogens in cattle waste.
TI  - Toll-dependent antimicrobial responses in Drosophila larval fat body require Spatzle secreted by haemocytes.
AB  - In Drosophila, the humoral response characterised by the synthesis of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) in the fat body (the equivalent of the mammalian liver) and the cellular response mediated by haemocytes (blood cells) engaged in phagocytosis represent two major reactions that counter pathogens. Although considerable analysis has permitted the elucidation of mechanisms pertaining to the two responses individually, the mechanism of their coordination has been unclear. To characterise the signals with which infection might be communicated between blood cells and fat body, we ablated circulating haemocytes and defined the parameters of AMP gene activation in larvae. We found that targeted ablation of blood cells influenced the levels of AMP gene expression in the fat body following both septic injury and oral infection. Expression of the AMP gene drosomycin (a Toll target) was blocked when expression of the Toll ligand Spatzle was knocked down in haemocytes. These results show that in larvae, integration of the two responses in a systemic reaction depend on the production of a cytokine (spz), a process that strongly parallels the mammalian immune response.
TI  - 14-day prulifloxacin treatment of acute uncomplicated cystitis in women with recurrent urinary tract infections: a prospective, open-label, pilot trial with 6-month follow-up.
AB  - Recurrent urinary tract infections (UTI) are very common in otherwise healthy young women, and can have a very negative social and economic impact. In order to evaluate the tolerability and efficacy of a 14-day course of prulifloxacin orally administered once daily, 51 young female patients, attending the same STD center between may and June 2007 for symptoms of cystitis, with a history of recurrent UTI and urine culture positive for uropathogens, were enrolled in this prospective study. Microbiological and clinical efficacy was tested over three follow-up visits at 1, 3 and 6 months. Quality of life (QoL) was measured and the impact of prulifloxacin in modifying the Lactobacillus vaginal flora was also evaluated. At baseline, the pathogens most commonly isolated were Enterococcus faecalis (43.2%) and Escherichia coli (27.5%). 41 of the 51 women, (80.3%) had Lactobacillus spp. in vaginal samples at baseline. microbiological results at follow-up examinations were as follows: after 1 month, 47 patients were recurrence-free and 4 had recurrence; after 3 months, 41 were recurrence-free, while 6 reported recurrence; finally, after 6 months, 36 were recurrence-free and 5 had recurrence. A statistically significant difference was reported between the QoL questionnaire mean scores at baseline (0.63), 1 (0.77), 3 (0.77) and 6 months (0.78) after treatment (all p<0.001). the vaginal swab cultures demonstrated that Lactobacillus spp. flora was maintained in 38 out of the 41 (92.6%) patients who had positive vaginal swab sample at baseline. in conclusion, a 14-day administration of prulifloxacin 600 mg is a safe, well tolerated and effective treatment for the management of UTI in young women.
TI  - Preparation of novel organovermiculites with antibacterial activity using chlorhexidine diacetate.
AB  - The novel antibacterial organovermiculites with different mass ratios of chlorhexidine diacetate (CA) were successfully prepared by ion exchange reactions. The resultant organovermiculites were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and thermal properties of prepared organovermiculites were investigated by simultaneous thermogravimetry (TG) and differential thermal analysis (DTA). The antibacterial activity of prepared organovermiculites against Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was evaluated by finding minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Antibacterial studies showed that the organovermiculites strongly inhibited the growth of variety of microorganisms.
TI  - Isolation and activity of two antibacterial biflavonoids from leaf extracts of Garcinia livingstonei (Clusiaceae).
AB  - The antibacterial activity of the acetone extract of Garcinia livingstonei leaves was studied using bioautography and by determining the minimum antibacterial concentration against four nosocomial pathogens. Bioautograms showed that two compounds were mainly responsible for the antibacterial activity. These were isolated by a combination of solvent-solvent fractionation and bioassay-guided chromatographic fractionation and were characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR and 2D NMR spectroscopy as amentoflavone and 4"-methoxy amentoflavone. The antibacterial activity of the isolated compounds was determined against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Three of the tested organisms were sensitive to both compounds with MIC values ranging from 8-100 microg/mL. P. aeruginosa was resistant with MICs > 100 microg/mL. The safety of the two compounds was assessed with a tetrazolium based colorimetric assay (MTT assay) using Vero monkey kidney cells. The compounds had low toxicity against the cell line with cytotoxic concentrations to 50% of the cells (LD50) of 386 microg/mL and > 600 microg/mL for amentoflavone and 4"-methoxy amentoflavone, respectively. Berberine, the positive control had a CC50 of 170 microg/mL. 4"-Methoxy amentoflavone was more active and much less toxic than amentoflavone.
TI  - Hospital and community isolates of uropathogens at a tertiary hospital in South Africa.
AB  - AIM: To investigate the profile of common uropathogens isolated from urine specimens submitted to the diagnostic microbiology laboratory at a tertiary teaching hospital and assess their antimicrobial susceptibility patterns to commonly used antimicrobial agents. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of laboratory reports for all urine specimens submitted for investigations over a 1-year period. Isolates were tested by means of the Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method for susceptibility to amoxicillin, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, co-trimoxazole and nitrofurantoin, and for extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) production. RESULTS: Out of the total specimens (N=2,203) received over the 1-year study period, 51.1% (1,126) of the urine samples were culture-positive, the majority (65.4%) having come from females. The most common isolate was Escherichia coli (39.0%) followed by Klebsiella species (20.8%) and Enterococcus faecalis (8.2%). The Gram-negative isolates displayed a very high level of resistance to amoxicillin (range 43 - 100%) and co-trimoxazole (range 29 - 90%), whereas resistance to gentamicin (range 0 - 50%) and ciprofloxacin (range 0 - 33%) was lower. E. coli isolates were susceptible to nitrofurantoin (94%), and ESBL production was significantly higher (p=0.01) in the hospital isolates, compared with those from the community referral sites. CONCLUSIONS: The culture-positive rate for uropathogens was high, with a greater incidence among females. E. coli was the most common aetiological agent identified, and remained susceptible to nitrofurantoin. Resistance levels to amoxicillin and co-trimoxazole were very high for all Gram-negative isolates, and it is recommended that these antibiotics should not be used for the empiric treatment of urinary tract infections.
TI  - Impact of a change in antibiotic prophylaxis on total antibiotic use in a surgical intensive care unit.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of reducing the length of antibiotic prophylaxis for cerebro spinal shunts on total antibiotic use and key resistant pathogens. METHODS: In January 2004, the use of antibiotic prophylaxis was reduced to a single shot dose with cefuroxime in an intensive care unit (ICU). Prior to this intervention, prophylaxis with second-generation cephalosporins was administered during the entire period of external cerebro spinal fluid (CSF) drainage. The effect on the antibiotic use density (AD: DDD [defined daily doses] per 1,000 patient-days[pd]) was calculated prior to (January 2002-December 2003) and following implementation of the intervention(January 2004-December 2006) by segmented regression analysis of an interrupted time series. Resistance proportions(RP) and resistance densities (RD), defined as resistant pathogen/1,000 pd of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis or E. faecium, third-generation-resistant (3GC) Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, and imipenem-resistant Pseudomonus aeruginosa, were compared by the Fisher's exact test before and after the intervention. RESULTS: Total antibiotic use by 147 DDD/1,000 pd decreased after the intervention when pre-operative prophylaxis was changed into single shot prophylaxis, from an estimated mean of 1,036 DDD/1,000 pd before the intervention to 887DDD/1,000 pd post-intervention. This decrease was primarily due to a significant reduction in the amount of cefuroxime used for prophylaxis. The reduction in total antibiotic consumption was sustainable, and it did not increase again during the next 36 months. The RR and RD of third-generation cephalosporin-resistant E. coli increased after January 2004, whereas the percentage of MRSA significantly decreased. CONCLUSION: Change to single shot prophylaxis along with an ongoing antibiotic stewardship program resulted in a cut-back in total antibiotic use amounting to as much as 15%. It would therefore appear that targeting interventions aimed at reducing antibiotic prophylaxis in surgical ICUs may be very worthwhile.
TI  - Selective inhibitors of bacterial phosphopantothenoylcysteine synthetase.
AB  - Bacterial phosphopantothenolycysteine synthetase (PPCS) catalyzes the formation of phosphopantothenoylcysteine (PPC) from (R)-phosphopantothenate, l-cysteine, and cytidine-5'-triphosphate (CTP) and has been shown to be essential for growth and survival. The reaction proceeds through a phosphopantothenoyl cytidylate, mixed anhydride intermediate. Both structural and kinetic characterization studies on PPCS have shown differences in the nucleobase binding site between the bacterial and human enzyme. We report for the first time the design and synthesis of mimics of the phosphopantothenoyl cytidylate, which proved to be potent inhibitors of PPCS. These compounds were evaluated in vitro against PPCS from human and several species of bacteria and showed marked selectivity (up to 1000-fold) toward the bacterial enzymes. A phosphodiester intermediate mimic was the most potent of the compounds synthesized and displayed slow-onset, tight-binding kinetics toward E. faecalis PPCS.
TI  - The Australian bush fly (Musca vetustissima) as a potential vector in the transmission of foodborne pathogens at outdoor eateries.
AB  - Abstract Australian outdoor activities are often accompanied by a barbeque (BBQ)  with family, friends, and guests, which are often interrupted by uninvited guests in the form of the Australian bush fly, Musca vetustissima. We investigated the bacterial loading associated with the Australian bush in three different environments: on a cattle farm, in a typical urban area (shopping center car park), and at a BBQ. The highest bacterial populations per fly were found to occur in a farm environment ( approximately 9.1 x 10(4) CFU per fly), whereas the bacterial population was lowest on flies caught in an urban environment ( approximately 1.9 x 10(4) CFU per fly). The median CFU per fly caught near a BBQ was approximately 5.0 x 10(4). Escherichia coli was the most commonly isolated potential pathogen, whereas Shigella sp. was the least common bacterial isolate that was screened. All isolated foodborne pathogens or indicator bacteria were screened for antibiotic resistance against commonly prescribed antibiotics. This revealed a very high prevalence of multidrug resistance, especially among the Salmonella and Shigella isolates of 94% and 87% resistance, respectively, against amoxicillin, roxythromycin and cefaclor.
TI  - Temperature and deactivation of microbial faecal indicators during small scale co-composting of faecal matter.
AB  - Small scale co-composting of faecal matter from dry toilet systems with shredded  plant material and food waste was investigated in respect to heat development and deactivation of faecal indicators under tropical semiarid conditions. Open (uncovered) co-composting of faecal matter with shredded plant material alone did not generate temperatures high enough (<55 degrees C) to reduce the indicators sufficiently. The addition of food waste and confinement in chambers, built of concrete bricks and wooden boards, improved the composting process significantly. Under these conditions peak temperatures of up to 70 degrees C were achieved and temperatures above 55 degrees C were maintained over 2 weeks. This temperature and time is sufficient to comply with international composting regulations. The reduction of Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis and Salmonella senftenberg in test containment systems placed in the core of the compost piles was very efficient, exceeding 5log10-units in all cases, but recolonisation from the cooler outer layers appeared to interfere with the sanitisation efficiency of the substrate itself. The addition of a stabilisation period by extending the composting process to over 4 months ensured that the load of E. coli was reduced to less than 10(3)cfu(-g) and salmonella were undetectable.
TI  - National monitoring for antimicrobial resistance among indicator bacteria isolated from food-producing animals in Japan.
AB  - The antimicrobial susceptibilities of 2,205 isolates of Escherichia coli and 1,181 isolates of Enterococcus faecalis (n=610) and E. faecium (n=571) from apparently healthy cattle, pigs and broiler and layer chickens collected from 2000 to 2003 were examined using an agar dilution method. Overall, the isolates from cattle and layer chickens showed a lower incidence of resistance to almost all antimicrobials studied compared with those from pigs and broiler chickens. Fluoroquinolone resistance was found at a low level in isolates of E. coli from four animal species and in E. faecalis from pigs and broiler and layer chickens. Resistance to cephalosporin was identified in isolates of E. coli from broiler chickens in 2000-2002 and from four animal species in 2003. Incidence of antimicrobial resistance in the bacteria did not vary from year to year during the investigation period.
TI  - Complete genome sequence of a newly isolated lytic bacteriophage, EFAP-1 of Enterococcus faecalis, and antibacterial activity of its endolysin EFAL-1.
AB  - AIMS: In this work, we aimed to identify an effective treatment of infections caused by Enterococcus spp. strains resistant to conventional antibiotics. METHODS AND RESULTS: We report the isolation and characterization of a new lytic bacteriophage, designated bacteriophage EFAP-1, that is capable of lysing Enterococcus faecalis bacteria that exhibit resistance to multiple antibiotics. EFAP-1 has low sequence similarity to all known bacteriophages. Transmission electron microscopy confirmed that EFAP-1 belongs to the Siphoviridae family. A putative lytic protein of EFAP-1, endolysin EFAL-1, is encoded in ORF 2 and was expressed in Escherichia coli. Recombinant EFAL-1 had broad-spectrum lytic activity against several Gram-positive pathogens, including Ent. faecalis and Enterococcus faecium. CONCLUSIONS: The complete genome sequence of the newly isolated enterococcal lytic phage was analysed, and it was demonstrated that its recombinant endolysin had broad lytic activity against various Gram-positive pathogens. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Bacteriophage EFAP-1 and its lytic protein, EFAL-1, can be utilized as potent antimicrobial agents against Enterococcus spp. strains resistant to conventional antibiotics in hospital infections and also as environmental disinfectants to control disease-causing Enterococcus spp. in dairy farms.
TI  - [In vitro susceptibilities to levofloxacin and various antibacterial agents of 12,919 clinical isolates obtained from 72 centers in 2007].
AB  - We have reported in this journal in vitro susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibiotics every year since 1992. In this paper, we report the results of an analysis of in vitro susceptibilities of 12,919 clinical isolates from 72 centers in Japan to selected antibiotics in 2007 compared with the results from previous years. The common respiratory pathogens, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Haemophilus influenzae maintained a high susceptibility to fluoroquinolones (FQs). The resistance of S. pyogenes to macrolides has been increasing every year and this was especially clear this year. Most strains of Enterobacteriaceae except for Escherichia coli showed a high susceptibility to FQs. Almost 30% of E. coli strains were resistant to FQs and the resistance increased further this year. FQs resistance of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was approximately 95% with the exception of 45% for sitafloxacin (STFX). FQs resistance of methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) was low at about 10%. FQs resistance of methicillin-resistant coagulase negative Staphylococci (MRCNS) was higher than that of methicillin-susceptible coagulase negative Staphylococci (MSCNS), but it was lower than that of MRSA. However, FQs resistance of MSCNS was higher than that of MSSA. FQs resistance of Enterococcus faecalis was 22.5% to 29.6%, while that of Enterococcusfaecium was more than 85% except for STFX (58.3%). In clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa derived from urinary tract infections, FQs resistance was 21-27%, which was higher than that of P. aeruginosa from respiratory tract infections at 13-21%, which was the same trend as in past years. Multidrug resistant strains accounted for 5.6% in the urinary tract and 1.8% in the respiratory tract. Acinetobacter spp. showed high susceptibility to FQs. The carbapenem resistant strains, which present a problem at present, accounted for 2.7%. Neisseria gonorrhoeae showed high resistance of 86-88% to FQs. The results of the present survey indicated that although methicillin-resistant Staphylococci, Enterococci, E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and N. gonorrhoeae showed resistance tendencies, and other species maintained high susceptibility rates more than 90% against FQs, which have been used clinically for over 15 years.
TI  - Antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral activities of some flavonoids.
AB  - Antibacterial and antifungal activities of six plant-derived flavonoids representing two different structural groups were evaluated against standard strains of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis and their drug-resistant isolates, as well as fungi (Candida albicans, C. krusei) using the microdilution broth method. Herpes simplex virus Type-1 and Parainfluenza-3 virus were employed for antiviral assessment of the flavonoids using Madin-Darby bovine kidney and Vero cell lines. Ampicillin, gentamycin, ofloxacin, levofloxacin, fluconazole, ketoconazole, acyclovir, and oseltamivir were used as the control agents. All tested compounds (32-128 microg/ml) showed strong antimicrobial and antifungal activities against isolated strains of P. aeruginosa, A. baumanni, S. aureus, and C. krusei. Rutin, 5,7-dimethoxyflavanone-4'-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside and 5,7,3'-trihydroxy-flavanone-4'-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside (0.2-0.05 microg/ml) were active against PI-3, while 5,7-dimethoxyflavanone-4'-O-[2''-O-(5'''-O-trans-cinnamoyl)-beta-D-apiofuranosyl] -beta-D-glucopyranoside (0.16-0.2 microg/ml) inhibited potently HSV-1.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of synthetic fire ant venom: the solenopsins and isosolenopsins.
AB  - BACKGROUND: We determined the in vitro activity of 9 synthetic fire ant venom alkaloids (+/-)-solenopsin A, (2R, 6R)-solenopsin A, (2S, 6S)-solenopsin B, (+/-)-isosolenopsin A, (2S, 6R)-isosolenopsin A,(2R, 6S)-isosolenopsin A, (+/-)-isosolenopsin B, (2S, 6R)-isosolenopsin B, and (2R, 6S)-isosolenopsin B against 6 species of bacteria (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). METHODS: The minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bacteriocidal concentration were determined in accordance with the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines. Time kill studies used American Type Culture Collection bacterial isolates tested at 5 times the minimum inhibitory concentration. RESULTS: None of the venom alkaloids inhibited E. coli or P. aeruginosa, whereas all the alkaloids inhibited S. pneumoniae. Only 4 alkaloids inhibited S. pneumoniae, S. aureus, and S. maltophilia. Time-kill kinetics indicates that all 4 active alkaloids had bactericidal activity. CONCLUSIONS: Specific isomers of synthetic fire ant venom alkaloids have antibacterial activity against human pathogens.
TI  - Chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the extracts of Kefe cumin (Laser trilobum L.) fruits from different regions.
AB  - Structural properties (using gas chromatographic analyses: gas chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry) of some compounds (pure chemicals, essential oils, extracts, etc.) and systematic investigation of antimicrobial activities (with agar dilution and agar diffusion disc methods) were determined in the fruits of Kefe cumin (Laser trilobum L.) obtained from different regions (Germany, India, and Turkey). The main components were established as limonene (41.03-72.24%) and perillaldehyde (4.23-32.75%) in the essential oils determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Mineral contents in the fruits were determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer. It was determined that the fruits were rich in potassium, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, sodium, arsenic and aluminium minerals. The highest sodium content was found to be 9,261.28 mg/kg in the samples obtained from Turkey, but the potassium content of the samples from Germany and India was higher than that of Kefe cumin fruits obtained from Turkey. The fruit extracts had a significant antimicrobial effect on pathogen bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus vulgaris (FMC 1), Proteus mirabilis, Bacillus cereus (FMC 19), Aeromonas hydrophila (ATCC 7965), Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 15753), Klebsiella pneumoniae (FMC 5), Salmonella typhimurium, Enterobacter aerogenes (CCM 2531) and Escherichia coli (ATCC 8739), whereas no significant antimicrobial effect of the essential oils was observed.
TI  - The amidase domain of lipoamidase specifically inactivates lipoylated proteins in vivo.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In the 1950s, Reed and coworkers discovered an enzyme activity in Streptococcus faecalis (Enterococcus faecalis) extracts that inactivated the Escherichia. coli and E. faecalis pyruvate dehydrogenase complexes through cleavage of the lipoamide bond. The enzyme that caused this lipoamidase activity remained unidentified until Jiang and Cronan discovered the gene encoding lipoamidase (Lpa) through the screening of an expression library. Subsequent cloning and characterization of the recombinant enzyme revealed that lipoamidase is an 80 kDa protein composed of an amidase domain containing a classic Ser-Ser-Lys catalytic triad and a carboxy-terminal domain of unknown function. Here, we show that the amidase domain can be used as an in vivo probe which specifically inactivates lipoylated enzymes. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We evaluated whether Lpa could function as an inducible probe of alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase inactivation using E. coli as a model system. Lpa expression resulted in cleavage of lipoic acid from the three lipoylated proteins expressed in E. coli, but did not result in cleavage of biotin from the sole biotinylated protein, the biotin carboxyl carrier protein. When expressed in lipoylation deficient E. coli, Lpa is not toxic, indicating that Lpa does not interfere with any other critical metabolic pathways. When truncated to the amidase domain, Lpa retained lipoamidase activity without acquiring biotinidase activity, indicating that the carboxy-terminal domain is not essential for substrate recognition or function. Substitution of any of the three catalytic triad amino acids with alanine produced inactive Lpa proteins. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The enzyme lipoamidase is active against a broad range of lipoylated proteins in vivo, but does not affect the growth of lipoylation deficient E. coli. Lpa can be truncated to 60% of its original size with only a partial loss of activity, resulting in a smaller probe that can be used to study the effects of alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase inactivation in vivo.
TI  - Detection of antibiotic resistant E. coli and Enterococcus spp. in stool of healthy growing children in Portugal.
AB  - From stool specimens of 118 healthy children's (1-14 years) in Portugal 92 E. coli and 101 Enterococcu s spp. strains have been isolated. Almost half (40.2%) of the E. coli isolates were resistant to ampicillin, 25.0% were resistant to tetracycline and 26.1% were resistant to streptomycin. Resistance genes detected by specific PCR included bla(TEM) and/or bla(SHV) and/or bla(CTX-M) (33 of 37 ampicillin and/or cefotaxime resistant isolates), tet (A) and/or tet (B) (16 of 23 tetracycline-resistant isolates), aad A (19 of 24 streptomycin-resistant isolates), cml A (in the two chloramphenicol-resistant isolates), aac (3)-II with/without aac (3)-IV (in the four gentamicin-resistant isolates), sul 1 and/or sul 2 and/or sul 3 (in all trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole resistant isolates). The majority of the resistant E. coli isolates (69.1%) belonged to phylogenetic group B2. Of the enterococci isolates E. faecium (n = 53), E. faecalis (n = 41), E. hirae (n = 4) and E. durans (n = 3) more than one-fourth (28.7%) of the isolates were resistant to tetracycline; 21.8% were resistant to erythromycin and 8.9% were resistant to kanamycin. Resistance genes detected by PCR in enterococci included aph (3)'-IIIa (in all kanamycin-resistant isolates), aac (6') (in all gentamicin-resistant isolates), tet (M) and/or tet (L) (26 of 29 tetracycline-resistant isolates), erm (B) (17 of 22 erythromycin-resistant isolates). This survey showed that faecal bacteria such as E. coli and enterococci of healthy growing children's could be a reservoir of antimicrobial resistance genes.
TI  - Assessment of antimicrobial resistance transfer between lactic acid bacteria and  potential foodborne pathogens using in vitro methods and mating in a food matrix.
AB  - The transferability of antimicrobial resistance from lactic acid bacteria (LAB) to potential pathogenic strains was studied using in vitro methods and mating in a food matrix. Five LAB donors containing either erythromycin or tetracycline resistance markers on transferable elements were conjugally mated with LAB (Enterococcus faecalis, Lactococcus lactis) and pathogenic strains (Listeria spp., Salmonella ssp., Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli). In vitro transfer experiments were carried out with the donors and recipients using both the filter and plate mating methods. The food matrix consisted of fermented whole milk (fermented with the LAB donors) with the pathogenic recipients added as contaminants during the production process. All transconjugants were confirmed by phenotypic and molecular methods. Erythromycin resistance transfer from LAB strains to Listeria spp. was observed using both in vitro mating methods at high transfer frequencies of up to 5.1 x 10(-4) transconjugants per recipient. Also, high frequency transfer (ranging from 2.7 x 10(-8) up to 1.1 x 10(-3) transconjugants per recipient) of both erythromycin and tetracycline-resistance was observed between LAB species using in vitro methods. No resistance transfer was observed to Salmonella spp., Staphylococcus aureus, and E. coli. The only conjugal transfer observed in the fermented milk matrix was for tetracycline resistance between two LAB strains (at a transfer frequency of 2.6 x 10(-7) transconjugants per recipients). This study demonstrates the transfer of antimicrobial resistance from LAB to Listeria spp. using in vitro methods and also the transfer of resistance between LAB species in a food matrix. It highlights the involvement of LAB as a potential source of resistance determinants that may be disseminated between LAB and pathogenic strains including Listeria spp. Furthermore, it indicates that food matrices such as fermented milks may provide a suitable environment to support gene exchange.
TI  - Antimicrobial and toxicological studies of some metal complexes of 4-methylpiperazine-1-carbodithioate and phenanthroline mixed ligands.
AB  - A few mixed ligand transition metal carbodithioate complexes of the general formula [M(4-MPipzcdt)x(phen)y]Y (M = Mn(II), Co(II), Zn(II); 4-MPipzcdt = 4-methylpiperazine-1-carbodithioate; phen = 1,10-phenanthroline; x = 1 and y = 2 when Y = Cl; x = 2 and y = 1 when Y = nil) were synthesized and screened for their antimicrobial activity against Candida albicans, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis by disk diffusion method. All the complexes exhibited prominent antimicrobial activity against tested pathogenic strains with the MIC values in the range <8-512 gmL(-1). The complexes [Mn(4-MPipzcdt)2(phen)] and [Co(4-MPipzcdt)(phen)2]Cl inhibited the growth of Candida albicans at a concentration as low as 8 microgmL(-1). The complexes were also evaluated for their toxicity towards human transformed rhabdomyosarcoma cells (RD cells). Moderate cell viability of the RD cells was exhibited against the metal complexes.
TI  - Influence of oral hygiene in patients with fixed appliances in the oral carriage  of antimicrobial-resistant Escherichia coli and Enterococcus isolates.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim was to study the oral carriage of Enterococcus and Escherichia coli isolates and their content in antimicrobial-resistance and virulence genes in patients with fixed appliances and in healthy volunteers. STUDY DESIGN: Samples from supragingival plaques/tooth surfaces/fixed orthodontic appliances were taken in patients with fixed appliances (n = 46) and in healthy volunteers (n = 55). Samples were seeded on specific media for enterococcal and E. coli recovery, and 1 isolate of each type per sample was selected. Antimicrobial susceptibility and the presence of genes encoding antimicrobial resistance, bacteriocins, and virulence factors were checked by polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Enterococci or E. coli were not recovered from healthy volunteers. Nevertheless, 10 isolates (5 E. faecium, 3 E. faecalis, and 2 E. coli) were obtained from 19.5% of patients with fixed appliances, and poor oral hygiene was evidenced in all of the these patients. Percentages of antimicrobial resistance and the resistance genes detected among the enterococci were: erythromycin: 100%, erm(B); kanamycin: 75%, aph(3')-IIIa; tetracycline: 50%, tet(L) with/without tet(M); streptomycin: 37%, ant(6)-Ia; chloramphenicol: 12%, catA. One E. coli isolate showed a phenotype of multiresistance containing 5 resistance genes and class 1 and 2 integrons. All enterococci produced gelatinase, and 4 isolates contained genes encoding enterocins L50A/B and P. The esp virulence gene was found in 1 multiresistant E. faecalis isolate. CONCLUSIONS: Poor or improper oral hygiene in individuals with fixed appliances favors the oral carriage of antimicrobial-resistant E. coli and enterococci. Additional investigations are needed to assess its implication in human health.
TI  - Comparative evaluation of antimicrobial activity of three cements: new endodontic cement (NEC), mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) and Portland.
AB  - Using the agar diffusion method, we conducted an in vitro study to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA), new endodontic cement (NEC) and Portland cement at different concentrations against five different microorganisms. A base layer was made using Muller-Hinton agar for Escherichia coli (ATCC 10538) and Candida (ATCC 10231). For Actinomyces viscosus (ATCC 15987), Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 10541) and Streptococcus mutans (ATCC 25175) blood agar medium was used. Wells were formed by removing the agar, and the materials were placed in the well immediately after manipulation. The plates were kept at room temperature for 2 h for prediffusion, and then incubated at 37 degrees C for 72 h. The inhibition zones were then measured. The data were analyzed using ANOVA and the Tukey test to compare the differences among the three cements at different concentrations. The positive controls showed bacterial growth, while the negative controls showed no bacterial growth. All materials showed antimicrobial activity against the tested strains except for Enterococcus faecalis. NEC created larger inhibition zones than MTA and Portland cement. This difference was significant for Portland cement (P < 0.05), but not for MTA (P > 0.05). Among the examined microorganisms, the largest inhibition zone was observed for Actinomyces group (P < 0.05). The antimicrobial activity of the materials increased with time and concentration (P < 0.05). It was concluded that NEC is a potent inhibitor of microorganism growth.
TI  - Freezing inactivation of Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis in water: response of different strains.
AB  - The effect of freezing temperature (-7, -15, -30 and -80 degrees C), number of freeze/thaw cycles (1 to 5 cycles) and sample volume (100 mL and 100 microL) on the viability of a pathogenic and an opportunistically pathogenic Escherichia coli, a vancomycin-resistant and a vancomycin-sensitive Enterococcus faecalis were examined. About 3.3 to 4.3 and 1.5 to 2.4 log reduction in cell density were observed in E. coli and E. faecalis, respectively, in the 100 mL samples frozen at -30 degrees C or warmer. Freezing at -80 degrees C was the least effective in killing the microbes, on average the log reduction at -80 degrees C was approximately 1.0 to 1.5 units less than those achieved at the three warmer temperatures. Based on statistical analysis, cell inactivation levels achieved at -7, -15, or -30 degrees C were not significantly different (P-value = 0.1648). There were no statistical difference in terms of log reduction obtained under all experimental conditions for the two E. coli strains (P-value = 0.46) and the two E. faecalis strains (P-value = 0.10). The number of freezing/thaw cycles and sample volume, however, profoundly affected inactivation capacity of freezing. Freezing could be an effective method for further reduction of E. coli and Enterococcus in municipal wastewater/sludge.
TI  - Chemical composition and antibacterial activity of the essential oil of Cordia verbenacea from the Venezuelan Andes.
AB  - The essential oil of Cordia verbenacea D.C. (Boraginaceae) that grows in Merida-Venezuela was obtained by hydrodistillation from the aerial parts of the plant, yielding 0.21%. The oil was analyzed by GC-FID and GC-MS. Thirty one components which made up 94.3% of the oil were identified. The most abundant constituents found were: tricyclene (23.9%), bicyclogermacrene (11.7%), germacrene D (9.9%) and beta-caryophyllene (8.2%). Antibacterial activity determination was carried out according to the disc diffusion assay. Activity against Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538 and Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, at a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 170 microg/mL and 200 microg/mL, was found.
TI  - In vitro activity of nemonoxacin, a novel nonfluorinated quinolone, against 2,440 clinical isolates.
AB  - The in vitro activity of nemonoxacin (TG-873870), a novel nonfluorinated quinolone, was tested against 2,440 clinical isolates. Nemonoxacin was at least fourfold more active than levofloxacin and moxifloxacin against most gram-positive cocci tested (shown by the following MIC(90)/range [microg/ml] values; community-associated methicillin [meticillin]-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, 0.5/0.015 to 2; Staphylococcus epidermidis, 0.5/0.015 to 4 for methicillin-susceptible staphylococci and 2/0.12 to 2 for methicillin-resistant staphylococci; Streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.015/< or = 0.008 to 0.25; Enterococcus faecalis, 1/0.03 to 128). Nemonoxacin activity against gram-negative bacilli was similar to levofloxacin and moxifloxacin (MIC(90)/range [microg/ml]; Escherichia coli, 32/< or = 0.015 to > or = 512; Klebsiella pneumoniae, 2/< or = 0.015 to 128; K. oxytoca, 0.5/0.06 to 1; Proteus mirabilis, 16/0.25 to > or = 512; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 32/< or = 0.015 to > or = 512; Acinetobacter baumannii, 1/0.12 to 16).
TI  - In vitro activity of tigecycline and comparator agents against a global collection of Gram-negative and Gram-positive organisms: tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial 2004 to 2007.
AB  - The Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial began in 2004 to monitor the in vitro activity of tigecycline and comparator agents against a global collection of Gram-negative and Gram-positive pathogens. Against Gram negatives (n = 63 699), tigecycline MIC(90)'s ranged from 0.25 to 2 mg/L for Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Serratia marcescens (but was > or =32 for Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Against Gram-positive organisms (n = 32 218), tigecycline MIC(90)'s were between 0.06 and 0.25 mg/L for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis. The in vitro activity of tigecycline was maintained against resistant phenotypes, including multidrug-resistant A. baumannii (9.2% of isolates), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing E. coli (7.0%) and K. pneumoniae (14.0%), beta-lactamase-producing H. influenzae (22.2%), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (44.5%), vancomycin-resistant E. faecium (45.9%) and E. faecalis (2.8%), and penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (13.8%). Tigecycline represents a welcome addition to the armamentarium against difficult to treat organisms.
TI  - Bathing waters: new directive, new standards, new quality approach.
AB  - Bathing water quality is an important public health issue, mainly because of fecal contamination. In 2006, the European Commission (EC) adopted a new directive with respect to recreational bathing waters that calls for stricter standards and reduces the number of laboratory tests done in routine beach monitoring from nineteen to two bacterial indicators, namely, Escherichia coli and intestinal enterococci, replacing policies of the EC Bathing Water Directive that have existed since 1976. Our practice in Portugal is in line with this international development, and this study demonstrates the equivalency of the new bacteriological parameters with the old. The water quality of 25 coastal beaches was surveyed using both new and old microbiological indicators of fecal contamination. Statistical analysis demonstrated equivalency of the results obtained for fecal coliforms with Escherichia coli and for fecal streptococci with intestinal enterococci.
TI  - Chemical composition, antifungal and antibacterial activity of the essential oil  of Chamaecyparis nootkatensis from Spain.
AB  - The chemical composition of the oil of Chamaecyparis nootkatensis (D. Don) Spach. has been analysed by gas chromatography (GC) and gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS). A total of 34 compounds were identified representing more than 90% of the total oil. The oil was richer in monoterpenes than in sesquiterpenes, the major constituents being limonene (53.2%), 6-3-carene (21.0%) and a-pinene (12.2%). The antibacterial and antifungal activities of the oil were also tested against Candida albicans, Bacillus subtilis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella sp. and Serratia marcescens. Only two of these, Bacillus subtilis and Candida albicans, were sensitive to the treatment, inhibition zones of 11 and 14 mm diameter being obtained, respectively. As far as we know, this is the first report of the antifungal and antibacterial activity of this species.
TI  - Evaluation of toxic side effects of clinically used skin antiseptics in vitro.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Skin antiseptics are widely used in health-care worldwide. However, there is a need to determine cytotoxicity of these medications on wounds. The aim of this study was to evaluate cytotoxic effects of five clinically used antiseptics on human skin cells. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Five clinically used skin antiseptics (Prontosan, Lavasept, Braunol, Octenisept, and Betaisodona) were tested. The minimal inhibitory concentration was determined against Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli). The cytotoxic effects on primary keratinocytes, fibroblasts, and a HaCaT cell line were determined (MTT-assay and BrdU-ELISA) at a wide range of concentrations. RESULTS: The agents tested showed effective antibacterial properties (Octenisept, Lavasept, and Prontosan showed higher efficacy than Braunol and Betaisodona) and different degrees of cytotoxicity. Lavasept and Prontosan demonstrated less toxicity on primary human fibroblasts and keratinocytes, whereas Octenisept, Betaisodona, and Braunol showed a significant (P<0.05) decrease in cell viability to 0% on keratinocytes at concentrations of 4%, 7.5%, and 12.5%, and on fibroblasts at 7.5% and 10%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Due to the cytotoxic effect of some antiseptics on human skin cells, it is advised that health care professionals balance the cytotoxicity of the medication, their antiseptic properties, and the severity of colonization when selecting a wound care antiseptic. In this study, Lavasept and Prontosan showed best result regarding antibacterial efficacy and cell toxicity.
TI  - Expression, purification, characteristics and homology modeling of the HMGS from  Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To understand the molecular basis for a potential reaction mechanism and develop novel antibiotics with homology modeling for 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) synthase (HMGS). METHODS: The genetic engineering technology and the composer module of SYBYL7.0 program were used, while the HMGS three-dimensional structure was analyzed by homology modeling. RESULTS: The mvaS gene was cloned from Streptococcus pneumoniae and overexpressed in Escherichia coli from a pET28 vector. The expressed enzyme (about 46 kDa) was purified by affinity chromatography with a specific activity of 3.24 micromol/min/mg. Optimal conditions were pH 9.75 and 10 mmol/L MgCl2 at 37 degrees C. The V(max) and K(m) were 4.69 micromol/min/mg and 213 micromol/L respectively. The 3D model of S. pneumoniae HMGS was established based on structure template of HMGS of Enterococcus faecalis. CONCLUSION: The structure of HMGS will facilitate the structure-based design of alternative drugs to cholesterol-lowering therapies or to novel antibiotics to the Gram-positive cocci, whereas the recombinant HMGS will prove useful for drug development against a different enzyme in the mevalonate pathway.
TI  - Transepithelial activation of human leukocytes by probiotics and commensal bacteria: role of Enterobacteriaceae-type endotoxin.
AB  - The goal of the current study was to clarify whether commercially available probiotics induce greater trans-epithelial activation of human leukocytes than do commensal, food-derived and pathogenic bacteria and to identify the compounds responsible for this activation. Eleven different bacterial strains, and some of their pathogen-associated molecular patterns, were incubated apically on a confluent layer of intestinal epithelial cells (Caco-2), which were basolaterally co-cultured with human mononuclear leukocytes. Only Gram-negative bacteria having Enterobacteriaceae-type endotoxin (commensal Escherichia coli K12, probiotic E. coli Nissle, EPEC) induced basolateral production of TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, IL 6, 8, and 10. Gram-positive probiotics (Lactobacillus spp. and Bifidobacterium spp.) had virtually no effect. In addition, commensals (Enterococcus faecalis, Bacteroides vulgatus) and food fermenters (Lactobacillus spp.) did not stimulate leukocytes transepithelially. Endotoxin from E. coli and Salmonella enterica Typhimurium induced comparable transepithelial stimulation of leukocytes, but not endotoxin from B. vulgatus or lipoteichoic acid from E. faecalis. Endotoxin-binding agents (polymyxin, colistin) completely abrogated transepithelial activation of leukocytes. Enterobacteriaceae-type endotoxin is a crucial factor in transepithelial stimulation of leukocytes, regardless of whether it is produced by probiotics or other bacteria. Hence, transepithelial stimulation ofleukocytes' innate immune response seems to not be linked to the health-promoting effects ofprobiotics.
TI  - Effect of mixed antimicrobial agents and flavors in active packaging films.
AB  - Active packaging is an emerging food technology to improve the quality and safety of food products. Many works have been developed to study the antimicrobial activity of essential oils. Essential oils have been traditionally used as flavorings in food, so they have an important odor impact but they have as well antimicrobial properties that could be used to protect the food. Recent developments in antimicrobial active packaging showed the efficiency of essential oils versus bread and bakery products among other applications. However, one of the main problems to face is the odor and taste they could provide to the packaged food. Using some aromas to mask the odor could be a good approach. That is why the main objective of this paper is to develop an antimicrobial packaging material based on the combination of the most active compounds of essential oils (hydrocinnamaldehyde, oregano essential oil, cinnamaldehyde, thymol, and carvacrol) together with some aromas commonly used in the food industry. A study of the concentration required to get the antimicrobial properties, the organoleptic compatibility with typical aroma present in many food systems (vanilla, banana, and strawberry), and the right combination of both systems has been carried out. Antimicrobial tests of both the mentioned aromas, the main components of some essential oils, and the combination of both groups were carried out against bacteria (Enterococcus faecalis, Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella choleraesuis, Yersinia enterocolitica, Escherichia coli), yeasts (Candida albicans, Debaryomyces hansenii, Zygosaccharomyces rouxii), and molds (Botrytis cinerae, Aspergillus flavus, Penicillium roqueforti, Eurotium repens, Penicillium islandicum, Penicillium commune, Penicillium nalgiovensis). The sensory properties of the combinations were evaluated with a triangular test and classification was by an order test; the odor threshold of the aroma compounds was also studied. The results reveal that none of the aromas had antimicrobial properties. The most antimicrobial compounds are thymol, carvacrol, and cinnamaldehyde, but none of them could be combined with banana aroma, whereas only thymol with strawberry aroma gave the right combined organoleptic profile. All of the antimicrobials under study could be combined with vanilla aroma, providing both antimicrobial property and the odor expected.
TI  - pH Modulation of efflux pump activity of multi-drug resistant Escherichia coli: protection during its passage and eventual colonization of the colon.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Resistance Nodulation Division (RND) efflux pumps of Escherichia coli extrude antibiotics and toxic substances before they reach their intended targets. Whereas these pumps obtain their energy directly from the proton motive force (PMF), ATP-Binding Cassette (ABC) transporters, which can also extrude antibiotics, obtain energy from the hydrolysis of ATP. Because E. coli must pass through two pH distinct environments of the gastrointestinal system of the host, it must be able to extrude toxic agents at very acidic and at near neutral pH (bile salts in duodenum and colon for example). The herein described study examines the effect of pH on the extrusion of ethidium bromide (EB). METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: E. coli AG100 and its tetracycline induced progeny AG100(TET) that over-expresses the acrAB efflux pump were evaluated for their ability to extrude EB at pH 5 and 8, by our recently developed semi-automated fluorometric method. At pH 5 the organism extrudes EB without the need for metabolic energy (glucose), whereas at pH 8 extrusion of EB is dependent upon metabolic energy. Phe-Arg beta-naphtylamide (PAbetaN), a commonly assumed inhibitor of RND efflux pumps has no effect on the extrusion of EB as others claim. However, it does cause accumulation of EB. Competition between EB and PAbetaN was demonstrated and suggested that PAbetaN was preferentially extruded. A K(m) representing competition between PAbetaN and EB has been calculated. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The results suggest that E. coli has two general efflux systems (not to be confused with a distinct efflux pump) that are activated at low and high pH, respectively, and that the one at high pH is probably a putative ABC transporter coded by msbA, which has significant homology to the ABC transporter coded by efrAB of Enterococcus faecalis, an organism that faces similar challenges as it makes its way through the toxic intestinal system of the host.
TI  - Detection of colon flora in peritoneal drain fluid after colorectal surgery: can  RT-PCR play a role in diagnosing anastomotic leakage?
AB  - A semi-quantitative Real-Time PCR strategy was developed to identify potential indicator organisms for anastomotic leakage in peritoneal drainage fluid, Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis. The analytical performance of the amplification method was validated with 10 culture-positive and 7 culture-negative peritoneal drain fluid samples, obtained from 9 different patients with a colorectal anastomosis. Real-Time PCR results were fully concordant with the microbiological culture results. However, among the culture-negative samples, four false-positive RT-PCR results were found. All false-positives originated from a single patient with a surgical site infection. This may indicate an elevated sensitivity of the RT-PCR method. The results showed that the semi-quantitative RT-PCR method has a clear potential to be useful as a powerful tool in early detection of anastomotic leakage.
TI  - Structure of the Enterococcus faecalis EIIA(gnt) PTS component.
AB  - In Eubacteria, the utilization of a number of extracellular carbohydrates is mediated by sugar specific phosphoenolepyruvate (PEP) dependent sugar phosphotransferase systems (PTSs), which simultaneously import und phosphorylate their target sugars. Here, we report the crystal structure of the EIIA(gnt) component of the so far little investigated Enterococcus faecalis gluconate specific PTS. The crystal structure shows a tightly interacting dimer of EIIA(gnt) which is structurally similar to the related EIIA(man) from Escherichia coli. Homology modeling of E. faecalis HPr, EIIB(man) and their complexes with EIIA(man) suggests that despite moderate sequence identity between EIIA(man) and EIIA(gnt), the active sites closely match the situation observed in the E. coli system with His-9 of EIIA(gnt) being the likely phosphoryl group carrier. We therefore propose that the phosphoryl transfer reactions involving EIIA(gnt) proceed according to a mechanism analog to the one described for E. coli EIIA(man).
TI  - [Antimicrobial activity of tebipenem against various clinical isolates from various specimen, mainly urinary tract].
AB  - Tebipenem is the active metabolite of ME1211, tebipenem pivoxil, a novel oral carbapenem that possesses potent activity against almost pathogens except for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In this study, we compared the susceptibility of tebipenem with current antibiotics against various organisms isolated from various specimen, mainly urinary tract. Tebipenem had a potent activity against Neisseria gonorrhoeae; its activity was comparable to it of cefixime that has most potent activity among oral antibiotics. Against Enterococcus faecalis, the activity of tebipenem was comparable to the activities of ampicillin and amoxicillin, and superior to it of faropenem. Against Citrobacter freundii, Escherichia coli , Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterobacter spp. including extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producers, tebipenem had a potent activity with or without ceftazidime-resistance.
TI  - Intra- and interspecies conjugal transfer of Tn916-like elements from Lactococcus lactis in vitro and in vivo.
AB  - Tetracycline-resistant Lactococcus lactis strains originally isolated from Polish raw milk were analyzed for the ability to transfer their antibiotic resistance genes in vitro, using filter mating experiments, and in vivo, using germfree rats. Four of six analyzed L. lactis isolates were able to transfer tetracycline resistance determinants in vitro to L. lactis Bu2-60, at frequencies ranging from 10(-5) to 10(-7) transconjugants per recipient. Three of these four strains could also transfer resistance in vitro to Enterococcus faecalis JH2-2, whereas no transfer to Bacillus subtilis YBE01, Pseudomonas putida KT2442, Agrobacterium tumefaciens UBAPF2, or Escherichia coli JE2571 was observed. Rats were initially inoculated with the recipient E. faecalis strain JH2-2, and after a week, the L. lactis IBB477 and IBB487 donor strains were introduced. The first transconjugants were detected in fecal samples 3 days after introduction of the donors. A subtherapeutic concentration of tetracycline did not have any significant effect on the number of transconjugants, but transconjugants were observed earlier in animals dosed with this antibiotic. Molecular analysis of in vivo transconjugants containing the tet(M) gene showed that this gene was identical to tet(M) localized on the conjugative transposon Tn916. Primer-specific PCR confirmed that the Tn916 transposon was complete in all analyzed transconjugants and donors. This is the first study showing in vivo transfer of a Tn916-like antibiotic resistance transposon from L. lactis to E. faecalis. These data suggest that in certain cases food lactococci might be involved in the spread of antibiotic resistance genes to other lactic acid bacteria.
TI  - Crystal structures of bacterial FabH suggest a molecular basis for the substrate  specificity of the enzyme.
AB  - FabH (beta-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthase III) is unique in that it initiates fatty acid biosynthesis, is inhibited by long-chain fatty acids providing means for feedback control of the process, and dictates the fatty acid profile of the organism by virtue of its substrate specificity. We report the crystal structures of bacterial FabH enzymes from four different pathogenic species: Enterococcus faecalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. Structural data on the enzyme from different species show important differences in the architecture of the substrate-binding sites that parallel the inter-species diversity in the substrate specificities of these enzymes.
TI  - Evidence for significantly enhancing reduction of Azo dyes in Escherichia coli by expressed cytoplasmic Azoreductase (AzoA) of Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - Although cytoplasmic azoreductases have been purified and characterized from various bacteria, little evidence demonstrating that these azoreductases are directly involved in azo dye reduction in vivo is known. In order to evaluate the contribution of the enzyme to azo dye reduction in vivo, experiments were conducted to determine the effect of a recombinant cytoplasmic azoreductase (AzoA) from Enterococcus faecalis expressed in Escherichia coli on the rate of metabolism of Methyl Red, Ponceau BS and Orange II. The intact cells that contained IPTG induced AzoA had a higher rate of dye reduction with increases of 2 (Methyl Red), 4 (Ponceau BS) and 2.6 (Orange II)-fold compared to noninduced cells, respectively. Metabolites of Methyl Red isolated from induced cultures were identified as N,N-dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine and 2-aminobenzoic acid through liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC/ESI-MS/MS) analyses. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that AzoA from Ent. faecalis is capable of increasing the reduction of azo dyes in intact E. coli cells and that cytoplasmic azoreductase is involved in bacterial dye degradation in vivo.
TI  - Research of urinary tract infections in family medicine physicians' offices--empiric antimicrobial therapy of urinary tract infections--Croatian experience.
AB  - In the period between October 1st and November 30th, 2006, we investigated a total of 3188 episodes of UTI (802 among males; 2386 among females) recorded in 108 family medicine offices in 20 cities in Croatia. The most common UTIs in women were acute uncomplicated cystitis (62%), complicated UTIs - cystitis and pyelonephritis (14%), urethritis (9%), acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis (6%), recurrent cystitis (5%), asymptomatic bacteriuria (3%) and recurrent pyelonephritis. The most common UTIs in men were complicated UTIs - cystitis and pyelonephritis (48%), urethritis (25%), prostatitis (24%) and asymptomatic bacteriuria (3%). Etiological diagnosis was made in 999 (31%) UTI episodes before antimicrobial therapy was given. The most frequently isolated causative pathogens were Escherichia coli (77%), Enterococcus faecalis (9%), Proteus mirabilis (5%), Klebsiella spp (3%), Streptococcus agalactiae (3%) and Enterobacter (1%). Antimicrobial drug was administered in 2939 (92.19%) UTI episodes, in 1940 (66.01%) as empirical therapy, and in 999 (34%) as targeted antimicrobial therapy. The most commonly administered drug in empirical therapy for acute uncomplicated cystitis, recurrent cystitis and urethritis in women was cephalexin, for acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis and complicated UTIs in women co-amoxiclav, and for UTIs in males ciprofloxacin. The results of this research of 3188 UTI episodes in family medicine physicians' offices provide a confirmatory answer to question whether empirical antimicrobial therapy of UTI prescribed by Croatian family practitioners is in accordance with the national guidelines.
TI  - Aryl rhodanines specifically inhibit staphylococcal and enterococcal biofilm formation.
AB  - Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus are the leading causative agents of indwelling medical device infections because of their ability to form biofilms on artificial surfaces. Here we describe the antibiofilm activity of a class of small molecules, the aryl rhodanines, which specifically inhibit biofilm formation of S. aureus, S. epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, E. faecium, and E. gallinarum but not the gram-negative species Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Escherichia coli. The aryl rhodanines do not exhibit antibacterial activity against any of the bacterial strains tested and are not cytotoxic against HeLa cells. Preliminary mechanism-of-action studies revealed that the aryl rhodanines specifically inhibit the early stages of biofilm development by preventing attachment of the bacteria to surfaces.
TI  - Innate and adaptive immunity cooperate flexibly to maintain host-microbiota mutualism.
AB  - Commensal bacteria in the lower intestine of mammals are 10 times as numerous as  the body's cells. We investigated the relative importance of different immune mechanisms in limiting the spread of the intestinal microbiota. Here, we reveal a flexible continuum between innate and adaptive immune function in containing commensal microbes. Mice deficient in critical innate immune functions such as Toll-like receptor signaling or oxidative burst production spontaneously produce high-titer serum antibodies against their commensal microbiota. These antibody responses are functionally essential to maintain host-commensal mutualism in vivo in the face of innate immune deficiency. Spontaneous hyper-activation of adaptive immunity against the intestinal microbiota, secondary to innate immune deficiency, may clarify the underlying mechanisms of inflammatory diseases where immune dysfunction is implicated.
TI  - In vivo antibacterial activity of vertilmicin, a new aminoglycoside antibiotic.
AB  - Vertilmicin is a novel aminoglycoside antibiotic with potent activity against gram-negative and -positive bacteria in vitro. In this study, we further evaluated the efficacy of vertilmicin in vivo in systemic and local infection animal models. We demonstrated that vertilmicin had relatively high and broad-spectrum activities against mouse systemic infections caused by Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis. The 50% effective doses of subcutaneously administered vertilmicin were 0.63 to 0.82 mg/kg, 0.18 to 0.29 mg/kg, 0.25 to 0.99 mg/kg, and 4.35 to 7.11 mg/kg against E. coli, K. pneumoniae, S. aureus, and E. faecalis infections, respectively. The therapeutic efficacy of vertilmicin was generally similar to that of netimicin, better than that of gentamicin in all the isolates tested, and better than that of verdamicin against E. coli 9612 and E. faecalis HH22 infections. The therapeutic efficacy of vertilmicin was further confirmed in local infection models of rabbit skin burn infection and mouse ascending urinary tract infection.
TI  - Evaluation of dipstick analysis among elderly residents to detect bacteriuria: a  cross-sectional study in 32 nursing homes.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Few studies have evaluated dipstick urinalysis for elderly and practically none present confidence intervals. Furthermore, most previous studies combine all bacteria species in a "positive culture". Thus, their evaluation may be inappropriate due to Yule-Simpson's paradox. The aim of this study was to evaluate diagnostic accuracy of dipstick urinalysis for the elderly in nursing homes. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study voided urine specimens were collected from 651 elderly individuals in nursing homes. Dipstick urinalysis for nitrite, leukocyte esterase and urine culture were performed. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values with 95% confidence intervals were calculated. Visual readings were compared to readings with a urine chemistry analyzer. RESULTS: 207/651 (32%) of urine cultures showed growth of a potentially pathogenic bacterium. Combining the two dipsticks improved test characteristics slightly compared to using only one of the dipsticks. When both dipsticks are negative, presence of potentially pathogenic bacteria can be ruled out with a negative predictive value of 88 (84-92)%. Visual and analyzer readings had acceptable agreement. CONCLUSION: When investigating for bacteriuria in elderly people at nursing homes we suggest nitrite and leukocyte esterase dipstick be combined. There are no clinically relevant differences between visual and analyzer dipstick readings. When dipstick urinalysis for nitrite and leukocyte esterase are both negative it is unlikely that the urine culture will show growth of potentially pathogenic bacteria and in a patient with an uncomplicated illness further testing is unnecessary.
TI  - Rapid QPCR-based assay for fecal Bacteroides spp. as a tool for assessing fecal contamination in recreational waters.
AB  - Concentrations of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB; e.g. Escherichia coli, and Enterococcus sp.) can only be used in limited ways for determining the source of fecal contamination in recreational waters because they cannot distinguish human from non-human fecal contamination. Several Bacteroides spp. have been suggested as potential alternative indicators. We have developed a rapid, culture-independent method for quantifying fecal Bacteroides spp. using quantitative PCR (QPCR) targeting the 16S rRNA gene. The assay specifically targets and quantifies the most common human Bacteroides spp. The details of the method are presented, including analyses of a wide range of fecal samples from different organisms. Specificity and performance of the QPCR assay were also tested via a laboratory experiment where human sewage and gull guano were inoculated into a range of environmental water samples. Concentrations of fecal Bacteroides spp., total Enterococcus sp., Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, and Enterococcus casseliflavus were measured using QPCR, and total Enterococcus sp. and E. coli were quantified by membrane filtration (MF). Samples spiked with gull guano were highly concentrated with total Enterococcus sp., E. coli, E. faecalis, and E. casseliflavus, demonstrating that these indicators are prominent in animal feces. On the other hand, fecal Bacteroides spp. concentrations were high in samples containing sewage and were relatively low in samples spiked with gull guano. Sensitivity and specificity results suggest that the rapid fecal Bacteroides spp. QPCR assay may be a useful tool to effectively predict the presence and concentration of human-specific fecal pollution.
TI  - Uropathogen interaction with the surface of urological stents using different surface properties.
AB  - PURPOSE: Ureteral stents commonly become infected or encrusted. Various coatings  have been developed to decrease bacterial adherence. To our knowledge there has been no in vitro testing of coating with heparin to date. We determined the effects of heparin coating on bacterial adherence of common uropathogens and physical stent properties. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Heparin coated Radiance ureteral stents (Cook) and noncoated Endo-Sof control stents were tested against triclosan eluting Triumph(R) stents and noneluting Polaris control stents for adherence of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa for 7 days. Adherent bacteria were determined and biofilms were visualized using fluorescent dyes. Radial, tensile and coil strength of the Radiance and Polaris stents was compared to determine the effect of heparin coating on physical stent characteristics. RESULTS: Heparin coating did not decrease bacterial adhesion compared to its control. E. coli adhesion was limited by all stents tested. The Polaris stent showed significantly greater resistance to bacterial adherence for Klebsiella, Pseudomonas and Enterococcus than the Endo-Sof and Radiance stents but was more susceptible to S. aureus adherence. The Triumph stent resisted all bacteria except Pseudomonas and Enterococcus. Mature biofilms were observed on all stents with lower viability on the Triumph stent. Radiance stents showed higher tensile and lower compression strength than its control. CONCLUSIONS: Heparin coating does not decrease bacterial adherence to ureteral stents. Drug eluting antimicrobials have an inhibitory effect on bacterial adherence and the Polaris stent showed the least bacterial adherence of the nondrug eluting ureteral stents tested.
TI  - Synthesis, characterization and evaluation of antibacterial activity of some thiazolo[3,2-b][1,2,4]triazole incorporating diphenylsulfone moieties.
AB  - A series of thiazolo[3,2-b][1,2,4]triazole incorporating diphenylsulfone moieties were synthesized starting from 5-[4-(4-X-phenylsulfonyl)phenyl]-4H-1,2,4-triazole-3-thioles 3a-c, X=H, Cl, Br. Thus, alkylation of 1,2,4-triazoles 3 with phenacyl bromide or 4-bromophenacyl bromide afforded S-substituted 1,2,4-triazoles 4, 5. These new intermediates 4 and 5, in the presence of H(2)SO(4) (c), were cyclized to 2-[4-(4-X-phenylsulfonyl)phenyl]-6-(4-Y-phenyl)[1,3]thiazolo[3,2-b]-[1,2,4]-triaz oles 6, 7 (I) and not to isomeric thiazolo[2,3-c][1,2,4]-triazoles 6, 7 (II). The newly synthesized compounds were characterized by IR, (1)H, (13)C NMR and elemental analysis. MS spectra confirmed the formation of thiazolo[3,2-b][1,2,4]triazole 6, 7 (forms I) in detriment of [2,3-c] isomeric compounds (forms II). The potential antibacterial effects of the synthesized compounds were investigated using standard bacterial strains: Acinetobacter baumannii ATCC 19606, Citrobacter freundii ATCC 8090, Escherichia coli ATCC 11775, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 9027, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 19433, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 12600, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 14990, Bacillus cereus ATCC 14579.

TI  - Molecular identification of coliform bacteria from colicky breastfed infants.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the presence of intestinal coliform bacteria in colicky vs healthy infants. STUDY DESIGN: We isolated coliform strains from faeces and performed quantitative bacterial cultures in 41 colicky and 39 healthy breastfed infants, identified using PCR with species-specific primers, strain-specific Automated Ribotyping and the API-50E kit for Enterobacteriaceae to identify the most frequent strains. RESULTS: Coliform strains were more abundant in colicky infants (median 6.04 log(10) CFU/g faeces, range 2.00-8.76) vs controls (median 4.47 log(10) CFU/g faeces, range 1.00-8.08) (p = 0.026). Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, E. aerogenes and Enterococcus faecalis were the predominant species in colicky and healthy infants. The counts of each bacterial species differed between the two groups, and the difference was significant (p = 0.002) for E. coli: median 6.30 log(10) CFU/g faeces (range 3.00-8.74) in colicky infants, and median 4.70 log(10) CFU/g faeces (range 2.00-5.85) in controls. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to evaluate the colonization patterns of gas-forming coliforms in colicky infants and healthy controls identified by molecular methods. Coliform bacteria, particularly Escherichia coli, were found to be more abundant in colicky infants. Our data could help to shed light on the cause of infantile colic.
TI  - Validation and field testing of library-independent microbial source tracking methods in the Gulf of Mexico.
AB  - Water quality is frequently impacted by microbial pollution from human and animal feces. Microbial source tracking (MST) can identify dominant pollution sources and improve assessment of health risk compared to indicator bacteria alone. This study aims to standardize and validate MST methods across laboratories in coastal Gulf of Mexico states. Three laboratories evaluated library-independent MST methods for human sewage detection via conventional PCR: (1) human-associated Bacteroidales, (2) human polyomaviruses (HPyVs), and (3) Methanobrevibacter smithii. All methods detected targets in human sewage seeded into buffer, freshwater or marine water (100% sensitivity). The limit of detection (LOD) for human sewage was lowest for the Bacteroidales assay (10(-5)-10(-6) dilution). LODs for HPyVs and M. smithii assays were similar to each other (10(-3)-10(-4)), but were higher than Bacteroidales. The HPyVs assay was 100% specific, showing no cross-reactivity to dog, cow, cat, bird, or wild animal feces among >300 samples from three Gulf Coast regions. The human Bacteroidales assay was 96% specific, but cross-reacted with 10% of dog and some chicken samples. The M. smithii assay was 98% specific with limited cross-reactivity with cow, dog and seagull samples. An experts' workshop concluded that all methods showed sufficient accuracy and reliability to move forward. SOPs will be distributed to collaborating laboratories for further inter-laboratory comparison, and field validation will occur in year 2.
TI  - [A clinical study of bile cultures and antibiotic susceptibility test in the patients with operation on biliary tract].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To illustrate the bacteriology and their susceptibility to antibiotics in patients with biliary tract diseases and provide information for antibiotic choices. METHODS: The bile specimens were cultured and pathogens' susceptibility to antibiotics was obtained intraoperatively from 195 patients undergoing operations on biliary tract and 24 healthy liver donors from June 2007 to March 2008. RESULTS: Among 195 bile specimens collected from the patients intraoperatively, 44 ones were found bacterial growth by culture (22.6%), in which 11 ones were mixed infections (25.0%). Fifty-five bacterial strains belonging to 16 species were identified from these bile specimens. They included 34 Gram negative strains (61.8%), 19 Gram positive strains (34.6%) and 2 fungal strains (3.6%). The commonest pathogens were Escherichia coli (27.3%), Enterobacter cloacae (12.7%), Enterococcus faecalis (12.7%) and Enterococcus faecium (10.9%). Among 24 bile specimens collected from the healthy liver donors, one was found Escherichia coli growth by culture (4.2%). The results of susceptibility test showed that the resistant rates of Gram negative strains to Meropenem was 2.8%, followed by Imipenem (5.6%), Sulperazone (22.8%) and Amikacin (28.7%). In this study Gram negative strains were highly resistant to Penicillins, Quinolones, some third generation Cephalosporins and so on (>50.0%). None of Gram positive strains were resistant to Vancomycin and Teicoplanin. They were highly resistant to Penicillins, Quinolones, Clindamycin and so on (>40.0%). CONCLUSIONS: (1) Gram negative strains remain the commonest pathogens in biliary tract infection in Renji Hospital and the commonest pathogen is Escherichia coli. The infection of enterococcus is going up. The mixed infection cases happen mostly in acute biliary infection. (2) To treat biliary infection the broad-spectrum antibiotics which are effective to Escherichia coli are optimal choices. Ceftazidime or Ciprofloxacin may be used in mild biliary infection. Sulperazone or Amikacin may be used in severe biliary infection. Imipenem and Vancomycins may be used as second choice to treat the infection which other drugs are ineffective to.
TI  - Hygienic effects and gas production of plastic bio-digesters under tropical conditions.
AB  - Plastic plug-flow bio-digesters have been promoted as a good option for improved  treatment of manure and wastewater in developing countries although minimal information has been published on their hygienic status. This bench-scale study replicates bio-digester conditions to evaluate the reduction of pathogen and indicator microorganisms at three different hydraulic retention times (HRT) in the anaerobic treatment of pig manures at 30 degrees C for 50 days. Results showed that physicochemical values differed between HRTs. Gas production efficiency was better for longer HRTS. The accumulated sludge at the reactor's base increased with longer HRT. Phages and bacteria examined were reduced, but none was completely eliminated. Log10 reduction of bacteria ranged from 0.54 to 2.47. Phages ranged from 1.60 to 3.42. The reduction of organisms at HRT = 30 days was about one log10 unit higher than HRT = 15 days and about two log10 units higher than HRT = 3 days. The results indicate that the reduction of tested organisms increases with HRT. However the hygienic quality of the liquid effluent does not meet required quality values for surface and irrigation water. Longer HRTs are recommended to increase gas yield and achieve higher pathogen reduction. More barriers should be applied while handling bio-digester outputs to minimise risks to environmental and human health.
TI  - Sudan azo dyes and Para Red degradation by prevalent bacteria of the human gastrointestinal tract.
AB  - Sudan azo dyes have genotoxic effects and ingestion of food products contaminated with Sudan I, II, III, IV, and Para Red could lead to exposure in the human gastrointestinal tract. In this study, we examined thirty-five prevalent species of human intestinal bacteria to evaluate their capacity to degrade Sudan dyes and Para Red. Among these tested bacterial strains, 23, 13, 33, 30, and 29 out of 35 species tested were able to reduce Sudan I, II, III, IV, and Para Red, respectively, to some extent. Bifidobacterium infantis, Clostridium indolis, Enterococcus faecalis, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, and Ruminococcus obeum were able to reduce completely all four tested Sudan dyes and Para Red. Escherichia coli and Peptostreptococcus magnus were the only two strains that were not able to reduce any of the tested Sudan dyes and Para Red to any significant extent. Metabolites of the reduction of the tested Sudan dyes and Para Red by E. faecalis were isolated and identified by HPLC and LC/ESI-MS analyses and compared with authentic standards. Thus it appears that the ability to reduce Sudan dyes and Para Red except Sudan II is common among bacteria in the human colon.
TI  - Increased d-lactic Acid intestinal bacteria in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome.
AB  - Patients with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) are affected by symptoms of cognitive dysfunction and neurological impairment, the cause of which has yet to be elucidated. However, these symptoms are strikingly similar to those of patients presented with D-lactic acidosis. A significant increase of Gram positive facultative anaerobic faecal microorganisms in 108 CFS patients as compared to 177 control subjects (p<0.01) is presented in this report. The viable count of D-lactic acid producing Enterococcus and Streptococcus spp. in the faecal samples from the CFS group (3.5 x 10(7) cfu/L and 9.8 x 10(7) cfu/L respectively) were significantly higher than those for the control group (5.0 x 10(6) cfu/L and 8.9 x 10(4) cfu/L respectively). Analysis of exometabolic profiles of Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus sanguinis, representatives of Enterococcus and Streptococcus spp. respectively, by NMR and HPLC showed that these organisms produced significantly more lactic acid (p<0.01) from (13)C-labeled glucose, than the Gram negative Escherichia coli. Further, both E. faecalis and S. sanguinis secrete more D-lactic acid than E. coli. This study suggests a probable link between intestinal colonization of Gram positive facultative anaerobic D-lactic acid bacteria and symptom expressions in a subgroup of patients with CFS. Given the fact that this might explain not only neurocognitive dysfunction in CFS patients but also mitochondrial dysfunction, these findings may have important clinical implications.
TI  - [Bacterial composition and resistance from urinary tract infections in females].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the bacterial composition and antibacterial resistance in female urinary tract infections (UTI) in China. METHODS: The disc diffusion test, minimum inhibition concentration (MIC), test or E-test was used to detect the antimicrobial susceptibility in 86 tertiary hospitals in China from June 1, 2006 to May 31, 2007. WHONET 5.4 was applied for data analysis. RESULTS: A total of 6071 pathogenic germs were collected from urine cultures of UTI female patients in the surveillance period, which included 5958 bacterial isolates. Escherichia coli 3529 strains (59.23%), Enterococcus spp 938 strains (15.74%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae 394 strains (6. 61%) were the most common pathogens. Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae had 35.7% and 34.0% extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) positive rates, and their resistant rates to quinolones were about 70% and 40%, respectively. Enterococcus faecium was much more resistant to almost all the antibiotics than Enterococcus faecalis. 0.9% Escherichia faecalis and 3. 8% Escherichia faecium were resistant to vancomycin, whereas 2.7% and 4.8% were resistant to teicoplanin. Staphylococcus epdermidis was more common in UTI than Staphylococcus aureus, 79.1% and 75.0% of the isolates being methicillin-ressitant Staphylococcus epdermidis (MRSE) or methicillin-ressitant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), respectively. No vancomycin intermediate or resistant staphylococcus was detected, but 4.9% teicoplanin intermediate rate was found in Staphylococcus epdermidis. The resistant rates to quinolones increased with the patient age. CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial resistance in UTI in Chinese females is a severe problem, which could be resulted from antimicrobial irrational use. In the selection of antimicrobial agents in the treatment of UTI, doctors should refer to the results of bacterial resistant surveillance.
TI  - [Multicenter study of in vitro activity of tigecycline in clinical isolates from  30 centers in Spain].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: In the last years, the increase of antibiotic resistances of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria is an important therapeutic problem. The antimicrobial activity of tigecycline, a novel glycylcycline, was evaluated against 750 bacterial isolates from 30 centers in Spain. METHODS: Multicenter and retrospective study. In 2005, thirty laboratories participated in this study. Data collected in this study included antimicrobial susceptibilities for S.aureus resistant to methicillin (MRSA), ESBL- E. coli or ESBL- K. pneumoniae, E. coli resistant to quinolons (E.coli- QR), Klebsiella spp and E. faecalis. Trains were obtained of the each Hospital s collection (5 strains of each microorganisms). The susceptibility determinations were performed locally by each laboratory following the standard method usually performed. The tigecycline susceptibility determinations were performed with E/test. RESULTS: Tigecycline was the most potent agent against MRSA, E. faecalis, E.coli-QR and ESBLs enterobacteriaceae; with MIC50-MIC90 values of: 0.125-0.25 g/ml; 0.125-0.5 g/ml; 0.25-0.75 g/ml and 0.38-1.5 g/ml; respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study confirm the excellent in vitro activity of tigecycline against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens, including multirresistant microorganisms.
TI  - Synthesis and evaluation of in vitro anti-microbial and anti-tubercular activity  of 2-styryl benzimidazoles.
AB  - A new series of novel 5-(nitro/bromo)-styryl-2-benzimidazoles (1-12) has been synthesized by simple, mild and efficient synthetic protocol by attempted condensation of 5-(nitro/bromo)-o-phenylenediamine with trans-cinnamic acids in ethylene glycol. Screening for in vitro anti-tubercular activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H(37) Rv, anti-bacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae bacterial strains and anti-fungal activity against Candida albicans and Asperigillus fumigatus fungal strains were carried out. Compounds 5, 7, 8, 9, 11 showed higher anti-tubercular activity and compounds 7, 8, 10, 11, 12 have proved to be effective with MIC (microg/ml) and emerged as lead molecules showing excellent activities against a panel of microorganisms. All synthesized compounds were characterized using IR, (1)H, (13)C NMR, GC-MS and elemental analysis.
TI  - Bacterial diversity of Darfiyeh, a Lebanese artisanal raw goat's milk cheese.
AB  - In order to contribute to the preservation of the Lebanese dairy heritage, the aim of this study was to characterize the Darfiyeh cheese, a traditional variety made from raw goat's milk and ripened in goat's skin. Three independent batches of Darfiyeh production were analyzed after 20, 40 and 60 days of ripening. Mesophilic lactobacilli, thermophilic coccal-shaped lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and thermophilic lactobacilli were enumerated. In order to explore the Darfiyeh natural ecosystem, a combination of phenotypical and molecular approaches was applied. The latter included Polymerase Chain Reaction-temporal temperature gel electrophoresis (PCR-TTGE), classical PCR and quantitative PCR. These methods revealed the presence of Streptococcus thermophilus, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus durans, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus malodoratus, group D Streptococcus sp., Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and L. lactis subsp. cremoris, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus curvatus, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Escherichia coli, Clostridium sp./Eubacterium tenue. Real-time PCR enabled quantification of E. faecium, with a detection of 10(7)-10(9) cfu g(-1) of product. The present molecular approaches combined with phenotypic method allowed describing the complex natural ecosystem of Darfiyeh, giving useful information for the preservation of Lebanese artisanal dairy products.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of tigecycline against resistant Gram-negative bacilli and enterococci by time-kill assay.
AB  - This time-kill study was performed with 65 genetically unique clinical isolates of Gram-negative bacilli and enterococci to further define the antibacterial activity of tigecycline. To our knowledge, this is the largest published time-kill study evaluating tigecycline activity to date. Isolates evaluated were 10 meropenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii; 15 Escherichia coli, including 10 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producers; 15 Klebsiella pneumoniae, including 10 ESBL producers; 20 vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE), including 10 that were linezolid resistant; and 5 vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis. Time-kill testing was performed using tigecycline concentrations of 1x, 2x, and 4x MIC with colony-forming units (CFU) per milliliter determined at 0, 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, and 48 h. Tigecycline MICs (microg/mL) were < or =1 for E. coli and K. pneumoniae, regardless of the isolates' ESBL production; A. baumannii, 0.06 to 4; 9/10 (90%) were < or =2; E. faecalis < or =0.12; and VRE < or =0.25, regardless of linezolid susceptibility. In the time-kill assay, tigecycline significantly inhibited bacterial growth when compared with the growth control. The reduction in growth was <3 log(10) CFU/mL for all isolates, indicative of a bacteriostatic effect.
TI  - Antiplasmid activity of 1'-acetoxychavicol acetate from Alpinia galanga against multi-drug resistant bacteria.
AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Alpinia galanga (L.) Swartz is traditionally used in the treatment of various ailments across India, China, and Southeast Asian countries. In India it is a reputed drug in indigenous system of medicine and largely used as antibacterial and antiseptic. In southern India the rhizomes has been used as a domestic remedy against bacterial infections. AIM OF THE STUDY: To identify a potential antiplasmid compound from Alpinia galanga against multi-drug resistant bacteria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The crude rhizome extract of Alpinia galanga was prepared in acetone. Antibacterial activity was checked by MIC and antiplasmid activity was checked by SIC. The principal compound responsible for the antiplasmid activity, in the crude extract, was identified by bioassay guided fractionation using hexane-acetone. Antibiotic resistance profile of plasmid harboring strains and plasmid cured strains was determined by disc diffusion method. RESULTS: The crude acetone extract of the rhizomes of Alpinia galanga exhibited antiplasmid activity against Salmonella typhi, Escherichia coli and vancomycin resistant Enterococcus faecalis with an efficiency of 92%, 82% and 8% respectively at 400 microg/ml SIC. The principal compound responsible for the activity was identified as 1'-acetoxychavicol acetate. 1'-Acetoxychavicol acetate demonstrated the ability to cure plasmid encoded antibiotic resistance in various multi-drug resistant bacterial strains of clinical isolates such as Enterococcus faecalis, Salmonella typhi, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Bacillus cereus with curing efficiency of 66%, 75%, 70%, 32% and 6% respectively at SIC of 400-800 microg/ml. CONCLUSION: 1'-Acetoxychavicol acetate mediated R-plasmid curing significantly reduced the minimal inhibitory concentration of antibiotics required to inhibit growth of bacteria, thus making the antibiotic treatment more effective.
TI  - Effect of three methods for cleaning dentures on biofilms formed in vitro on acrylic resin.
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of three denture hygiene methods against different microbial biofilms formed on acrylic resin specimens. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The set (sterile stainless steel basket and specimens) was contaminated (37 degrees C for 48 hours) by a microbial inoculum with 10(6) colony-forming units (CFU)/ml (standard strains: Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans, Escherichia coli, Candida albicans, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterococcus faecalis; field strains: S. mutans, C. albicans, C. glabrata, and C. tropicalis). After inoculation, specimens were cleansed by the following methods: (1) chemical: immersion in an alkaline peroxide solution (Bonyplus tablets) for 5 minutes; (2) mechanical: brushing with a dentifrice for removable prostheses (Dentu Creme) for 20 seconds; and (3) a combination of chemical and mechanical methods. Specimens were applied onto a Petri plate with appropriate culture medium for 10 minutes. Afterward, the specimens were removed and the plates incubated at 37 degrees C for 48 hours. RESULTS: Chemical, mechanical, and combination methods showed no significant difference in the reduction of CFU for S. aureus, S. mutans (ATCC and field strain), and P. aeruginosa. Mechanical and combination methods were similar and more effective than the chemical method for E. faecalis, C. albicans (ATCC and field strain), and C. glabrata. The combination method was better than the chemical method for E. coli and C. tropicalis, and the mechanical method showed intermediate results. CONCLUSION: The three denture hygiene methods showed different effects depending on the type of microbial biofilms formed on acrylic base resin specimens.
TI  - Novel furanylarylene arylsulfonylindolesulfonamides: synthesis and their antibacterial evaluation.
AB  - An array of furanylarylene arylsulfonylindolesulfonamides was synthesized through multi-step synthetic protocols involving bromination, stannylation, Stille cross coupling, reduction, arylsulfonylation, chlorosulfonylation, and condensation reactions. As a preliminary evaluation, these analogs were tested for antibacterial activity against a series of bacterial strains such as Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae using a two-fold serial dilution assay. Whereas analogs possessing unsubstitution, bromosubstitution, or methyl substitution on the benzene ring of benzenesulfonyl group were less active/inactive, the methoxy and chloro substituted counterparts were demonstrated to be comparatively more active. A few of them were found to exhibit better activity than the standard, streptomycin against selective organisms.
TI  - A DNA array based assay for the characterization of microbial community in raw milk.
AB  - An oligonucleotide array based on PCR method containing a combination of probes for taxonomic markers and species-specific virulence genes was developed for the simultaneous identification of 14 Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) and food-borne pathogenic bacteria in raw milk. The hypervariable regions V3 and V6 of 16S, together with a variable region of 23S rRNA genes and several genes specific for virulence factors were selected. Universal primers and multiplex PCR were used for the rapid differentiation of bacterial species and low concentration of specific pathogenic and spoilage bacteria were detected in milk. The dominant species such as Streptococcus thermophilus, Enterococcus faecalis, Lactococcus lactis, andLeuconostoc lactis were identified by indirect-labelling reactions based upon incorporation of amino-allyl dUTPs. The results regarding food-borne pathogens detection showed highly specific hybridisation patterns with the genomic DNA from Campylobacter jejuni, Escherichia coli, Salmonella thyphimurium, Listeria monocytogenes and Yersinia enterocolitica. A clear differentiation of dominant species present in a complex microbial community such as raw milk was achieved by the application of short oligonucleotide probes which discriminate sequences differing by few nucleotides.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of six pomegranate (Punica granatum L.) varieties and their relation to some of their pomological and phytonutrient characteristics.
AB  - Arils from six pomegranate (Punica granatum L.) varieties grown in the Mediterranean region of Turkey were tested for their antimicrobial properties by the agar diffusion and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) methods against seven bacteria: (Bacillus megaterium DSM 32, Pseudomonas aeruginosa DSM 9027, Staphylococcus aureus Cowan 1, Corynebacterium xerosis UC 9165, Escherichia coli DM, Enterococcus faecalis A10, Micrococcus luteus LA 2971), and threefungi (Kluvyeromyces marxianus A230, Rhodotorula rubra MC12, Candida albicans ATCC 1023). It has been observed that the pomegranate aril extracts had antimicrobial effect on all microorganisms, giving inhibition zones ranging in size from 13 to 26 mm. The MIC values for active pomegranate extracts ranged between 30 and >90 microg/mL. The results obtained appeared to confirm the antimicrobial potential of the Punica granatum varieties.
TI  - MurF inhibitors with antibacterial activity: effect on muropeptide levels.
AB  - MurF catalyzes the last cytoplasmic step of bacterial cell wall synthesis and is  essential for bacterial survival. Our previous studies used a pharmacophore model of a MurF inhibitor to identify additional inhibitors with improved properties. We now present the characterization of two such inhibitors, the diarylquinolines DQ1 and DQ2. DQ1 inhibited Escherichia coli MurF (50% inhibitory concentration, 24 microM) and had modest activity (MICs, 8 to 16 microg/ml) against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-defective E. coli and wild-type E. coli rendered permeable with polymyxin B nonapeptide. DQ2 additionally displayed activity against gram-positive bacteria (MICs, 8 to 16 microg/ml), including methicillin (meticillin)-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolates and vancomycin-susceptible and -resistant Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium isolates. Treatment of LPS-defective E. coli cells with >or=2x MIC of DQ1 resulted in a 75-fold-greater accumulation of the MurF substrate compared to the control, a 70% decline in the amount of the MurF product, and eventual cell lysis, consistent with the inhibition of MurF within bacteria. DQ2 treatment of S. aureus resulted in similar effects on the MurF substrate and product quantities. At lower levels of DQ1 (<or=1x MIC), the level of accumulation of the substrate was less pronounced (15-fold greater compared to the amount for the control). However, a 50% increase in the amount of the MurF product compared to the control was reproducibly observed, consistent with the possible upregulation of muropeptide biosynthesis upon partial inhibition of this pathway. The overexpression of cloned MurF appeared to partly alleviate the DQ1-mediated inhibition of muropeptide synthesis. The identification of MurF inhibitors such as DQ1 and DQ2 that disrupt cell wall biosynthesis suggests that MurF remains a viable target for an antibacterial agent.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of selected plant species from "the Argentine Puna" against sensitive and multi-resistant bacteria.
AB  - AIM: The plant species reported here are traditionally used in the "Puna" or "Altiplano" of Argentina for ailments related to bacterial infections. The aim of this study was to evaluate their antimicrobial properties against a panel of sensitive and multi-resistant gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The antimicrobial activity of tinctures and aqueous extracts (Baccharis boliviensis, Chiliotrichiopsis keidelii, Chuquiraga atacamensis, Fabiana bryoides, Fabiana densa, Fabiana punensis, Frankenia triandra, Parastrephia lucida, Parastrephia lepidophylla, Parastrephia phyliciformis, Tetraglochin cristatum) was determined using the agar macrodilution and broth microdilution methods recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI, formerly NCCLS). The antibiotic resistant clinical strains were isolated from nosocomial infection in human lesions of skin and soft parts. RESULTS: The ethanolic extracts of 11 plant species inhibited the growth of one or more of the following strains: Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Morganella morganii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Ethanol extracts (tinctures) of aerial parts of Baccharis, Fabiana and Parastrephia showed the highest levels of antibacterial activity on methicillin, oxacillin and gentamicin resistant Staphylococcus with MIC values from 20 to 150 microg/ml. Baccharis boliviensis and Fabiana bryoides were more active than the other plant species on Enterococcus faecalis with different phenotype. The most interesting activity on multi-resistant gram-negative strains was obtained from Chuquiraga atacamensis. Parastrephia species showed activity against Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis. The ethanolic extracts exhibited stronger activity and broader spectrum of action than aqueous extracts. The extracts were bactericidal in most cases. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of antibacterial activity in Puna plant extracts against multi-resistant bacteria give support to their traditional use for treating conditions associated with microorganisms in humans and animals and consequently seems promising for the treatment of multi-resistant bacteria.
TI  - Survival of enteric bacteria and coliphage MS2 in pure human urine.
AB  - AIMS: The survival of Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium,  Enterococcus faecalis and coliphage MS2 was studied in stored, fresh and diluted (1 : 1) human urine at 15 and 30 degrees C. METHODS AND RESULTS: Survival rate was studied by the plate count method. All the organisms showed rapid inactivation in stored urine, but they survived better in diluted and fresh urine. The high pH level and temperature were the major factors found to influence the survival of the micro-organisms with the survival rate being higher at 15 degrees C than at 30 degrees C. CONCLUSIONS: The destruction of all micro-organisms in stored urine required <1 week at 30 degrees C. Thus, the storage of urine is a useful way to reduce the risk of contamination while using urine as a fertilizer. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The urine fertilization is aimed for the developing countries and the high temperatures in these countries may hasten the destruction of micro-organisms in urine. On the contrary, a higher survival rate of these organisms in fresh and diluted urine is a public health concern because the dilution of urine with water is likely to happen during flushing.
TI  - Antibacterial profile of fermented seed extracts of Ricinus communis: findings from a preliminary analysis.
AB  - The study was carried out to ascertain the antibacterial properties inherent in fermented seed extracts of Ricinus communis. Dry seeds of R. communis (Castor oil plant) were deshelled, grounded to powder, fermented, and then extracted both with alcohol and water using Soxhlet machine. Different concentrations of the extracts were tested against selected bacteria using diffusion method of susceptibility testing on sensitivity testing agar medium. Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, and Staphylococcus aureus were highly susceptible to both the methanol and water extracts of the seed while Pseudomonas aeruginosa showed reduced susceptibility. Enterococcus faecalis on the other hand was resistant to all the preparations tested. The active antimicrobial ingredients in fermented R. communis seeds should be identified while its medicinal value to humans properly investigated.
TI  - Combinatorial expression of bacterial whole mevalonate pathway for the production of beta-carotene in E. coli.
AB  - The increased synthesis of building blocks of IPP (isopentenyl diphosphate) and DMAPP (dimethylallyl diphosphate) through metabolic engineering is a way to enhance the production of carotenoids. Using E. coli as a host, IPP and DMAPP supply can be increased significantly through the introduction of foreign MVA (mevalonate) pathway into it. The MVA pathway is split into two parts with the top and bottom portions supplying mevalonate from acetyl-CoA, and IPP and DMAPP from mevalonate, respectively. The bottom portions of MVA pathway from Streptococcus pneumonia, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes and Saccharomyces cerevisiae were compared with exogenous mevalonate supplementation for beta-carotene production in recombinant Escherichia coli harboring beta-carotene synthesis genes. The E. coli harboring the bottom MVA pathway of S. pneumoniae produced the highest amount of beta-carotene. The top portions of MVA pathway were also compared and the top MVA pathway of E. faecalis was found out to be the most efficient for mevalonate production in E. coli. The whole MVA pathway was constructed by combining the bottom and top portions of MVA pathway of S. pneumoniae and E. faecalis, respectively. The recombinant E. coli harboring the whole MVA pathway and beta-carotene synthesis genes produced high amount of beta-carotene even without exogenous mevalonate supplementation. When comparing various E. coli strains - MG1655, DH5alpha, S17-1, XL1-Blue and BL21 - the DH5alpha was found to be the best beta-carotene producer. Using glycerol as the carbon source for beta-carotene production was found to be superior to glucose, galactose, xylose and maltose. The recombinant E. coli DH5alpha harboring the whole MVA pathway and beta-carotene synthesis genes produced beta-carotene of 465mg/L at glycerol concentration of 2% (w/v).
TI  - Variation of broth composition by addition of broiler litter composting substrate extracts: influence on faecal bacterial growth.
AB  - AIM: This study investigates differences in bacterial growth response in broth amended with compost-substrate extracts periodically bypassed during broiler litter composting. METHODS AND RESULTS: Compost samples, suspended in diluent were mixed with double strength broth into which ampicillin selective (0.3 g l(-1)) Escherichia coli and E. faecalis were separately seeded. Growth was measured by viable cell count. The Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm was applied to obtain a four-parameter sigmoidal function that best described the diminishing height transitions of the curves for extracts of increasing composting age. The time course of the growth rate followed a unimodal bell-shaped curve. The Microfit application was run to generate information of direct microbiological interest: increasing lambda and decreasing mu(max) for both bacteria with time. CONCLUSION: More than the curve-fitting process, the Unified model option of the Microfit application has confirmed the significant differences (P < 0.05) in the growth curve behaviour with more stabilized substrate extracts. The study demonstrates further scopes for characterization of the sanitization potential and indirectly, the impact of indigenous microbial competitive exclusion effects on enteric bacteria. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: A different outlook to understanding faecal bacterial growth dynamics in compost has been presented, using predictive microbiology concepts. Further structured studies are needed to fine-tune the generality of the findings for model development.
TI  - Dynamics of bacterial community in solid-state fermented feed revealed by 16S rRNA.
AB  - AIMS: The aim of the present study was to monitor the changes in the composition  of microbiota in solid-state fermented feed and to evaluate their biosafety. METHODS AND RESULTS: In the solid-state fermentation, six probiotic bacteria strains were used as inoculum and soybean meal were used as carbohydrate source. At 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10 and 15 days, samples were collected for further analysis. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis showed that Bifidobacterium bifidum and Bacillus licheniformis were always present throughout the fermentation. Bifidobacterium bifidum, Enterococcus faecalis and Lactobacillus acidophilum were dominant throughout the entire fermentation as monitored by Lactobacillus-specific PCR-DGGE. Probiotics supplementation could reduce the levels of the pathogenic bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) by species-specific real-time PCR. And Salmonella spp. was not detected throughout the entire fermentation. CONCLUSIONS: Probiotics supplemented are always dominant throughout the whole period of solid-state fermentation and effective in preventing the growth of pathogens. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Based on the results, the high quality, stable solid-state fermented feed could be produced and applied in the pigs to improve the animal performances.
TI  - Composition and antimicrobial activity of Marrubium incanum Desr. (Lamiaceae) essential oil.
AB  - The essential oil from the aerial parts of Marrubium incanum Desr. (Lamiaceae), obtained by hydrodistillation, was analyzed by GC and GC-MS. Forty-six compounds were identified, representing 96.3% of the total oil. The main components of the oil were (E)-caryophyllene (27.0%), germacrene D (26.2%) and bicyclogermacrene (11.5%). The microbial growth inhibitory properties of the isolated essential oil were determined using the agar diffusion and broth microdilution method against seven bacterial species (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, S. epidermidis ATCC 12228, Micrococcus flavus ATCC 10240, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Klebsiella pneumoniae NCIMB 9111, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853), and two strains of the yeast Candida albicans (ATCC 10259 and ATCC24433). The essential oil showed activity against all the microorganisms tested, but differences in microbial susceptibility were registered.
TI  - Antibacterial and anticandidal screening of Tunisian Citrullus colocynthis Schrad. from Medenine.
AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Resistance to current antibacterial drugs and the rise of opportunistic fungal infections are growing global concerns. Traditional medicine is a potential source of new antibacterials and antifungals. Citrullus colocynthis Schrad. (Cucurbitaceae) endemic in Southern Tunisia, is used in folk medicine against dermatological, gynaecological and pulmonary infections. AIM OF STUDY: To assess in vitro antibacterial and anticandidal activity of aqueous and diluted acetone extracts of Citrullus colocynthis Schrad. MIC and MBC/MFC were determined for plant organs at different maturation stages. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Citrullus colocynthis Schrad. was harvested and its identification was verified. Aqueous and diluted acetone extracts (from the plant's roots, stems, leaves and three maturation stages of its fruit and seeds) were screened for activity against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis)-and various Candida spp. (Candida glabrata, Candida albicans, Candida parapsilosis and Candida kreusei). RESULTS: All extracts showed activity against all strains. The highest MICs and MBCs/MFCs were obtained from the fruit aqueous extracts (MIC 0.10mg/ml against Candida albicans and Candida glabrata, 0.20mg/ml against Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa), lowest activity from the root extracts. CONCLUSIONS: Citrullus colocynthis Schrad. shows antibacterial and anticandidal properties. The folk medicinal use as a broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent is validated.
TI  - Real-time microgravimetric quantification of Cryptosporidium parvum in the presence of potential interferents.
AB  - The quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D) is used to develop a biosensor for detection of viable Cryptosporidium parvum (C. parvum) in water matrices of varying complexity. In a clean environment, a good log-log linear response is obtained for detection of C. parvum in aqueous suspensions with oocyst concentrations from 3x10(5) to 1x10(7)oocysts/mL. C. parvum detection is slightly affected by the presence of dissolved organic acids, likely due to steric stabilization and/or masking of the antibodies/antigens by adsorbed molecules. Colloidal contaminants generally have a greater influence as biosensor interferents, whereby the presence of model latex microspheres, Enterococcus faecalis, or Escherichia coli, led to decreases in biosensor response of up to 64%, 40%, and 20%, respectively.
TI  - Cytotoxicity, antimicrobial activity and composition of essential oil from Tanacetum balsamita L. subsp. balsamita.
AB  - The aerial parts of Tanacetum balsamita subsp. balsamita were collected at full flowering stage from Tabriz, Iran. The essential oil was isolated by hydrodistillation and analyzed by combination of capillary GC and GC-MS. Twenty seven components were identified, representing 99.2% of the total oil. Carvone (51.0%), beta-thujone (20.8%), 1,8-cineole (4.4%) and alpha-thujone (3.2%) were the main components. The in vitro antimicrobial activity of the essential oil of T. balsamita subsp. balsamita was studied against eight Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (Bacillus subtilis, B. pumulis, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae) and three fungi (Candida albicans, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Aspergillus niger). The results of the antimicrobial activity of the essential oil according to the disc diffusion method and MIC values indicated that the oil exhibited moderate to high antimicrobial activity. The in vitro toxicological study based on the MTT cytotoxicity assay on human fetal skin fibroblast (HFSF) and Monkey kidney (Vero) cell lines showed IC50 values of 2500 and 1250 microg/mL, respectively.
TI  - Charge effect on the photoinactivation of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria by cationic meso-substituted porphyrins.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In recent times photodynamic antimicrobial therapy has been used to efficiently destroy Gram (+) and Gram (-) bacteria using cationic porphyrins as photosensitizers. There is an increasing interest in this approach, namely in the search of photosensitizers with adequate structural features for an efficient photoinactivation process. In this study we propose to compare the efficiency of seven cationic porphyrins differing in meso-substituent groups, charge number and charge distribution, on the photodynamic inactivation of a Gram (+) bacterium (Enterococcus faecalis) and of a Gram (-) bacterium (Escherichia coli). The present study complements our previous work on the search for photosensitizers that might be considered good candidates for the photoinactivation of a large spectrum of environmental microorganisms. RESULTS: Bacterial suspension (10(7) CFU mL(-1)) treated with different photosensitizers concentrations (0.5, 1.0 and 5.0 microM) were exposed to white light (40 W m(-2)) for a total light dose of 64.8 J cm(-2). The most effective photosensitizers against both bacterial strains were the Tri-Py+-Me-PF and Tri-Py+-Me-CO2Me at 5.0 microM with a light fluence of 64.8 J cm(-2), leading to > 7.0 log (> 99,999%) of photoinactivation. The tetracationic porphyrin also proved to be a good photosensitizer against both bacterial strains. Both di-cationic and the monocationic porphyrins were the least effective ones. CONCLUSION: The number of positive charges, the charge distribution in the porphyrins' structure and the meso-substituent groups seem to have different effects on the photoinactivation of both bacteria. As the Tri-Py+-Me-PF porphyrin provides the highest log reduction using lower light doses, this photosensitizer can efficiently photoinactivate a large spectrum of environmental bacteria. The complete inactivation of both bacterial strains with low light fluence (40 W m(-2)) means that the photodynamic approach can be applied to wastewater treatment under natural light conditions which makes this technology cheap and feasible in terms of the light source.
TI  - New "ON-OFF"-type nanobiodetector.
AB  - A new type of nanobiodetector based on a limited number of polyaniline nanofibrils has been designed and tested against bacteria Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis. The cells attaching conducting nanofibrils modify locally the electrical conductivity making the polymer nanowires electrically inhomogeneous. The "defects" accumulate in nanofibrils changing suddenly their electrical conductivity above a threshold density (the percolation limit), enabling an easy flow of the charge carriers. The results are unique: the device works like an "ON-OFF" switch with nearly linear response above a threshold number of cells in the suspension examined, which is of an order of 10(5) to 10(6) CFU per 1 ml. Such a behaviour is important for bio-alarm systems, environmental monitoring and medical applications.
TI  - Antibacterial activity and essential oil composition of Satureja spicigera from Iran.
AB  - The aerial parts of Satureja spicigera were collected at full flowering stage at  Gazvin, Iran. The essential oil was isolated by hydrodistillation and analyzed by a combination of capillary GC and GC-MS. Fourteen compounds were identified, of which carvacrol (53.74%) and thymol (36.03%) were the main constituents, representing 99.12% of the total oil. The in vitro antibacterial activity of the essential oil was determined against six ATCC standard bacterial strains (Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) using disc diffusion as well as measurement of minimum inhibitory concentrations. The disc diffusion results and MIC values indicated high inhibitory activity against the test bacteria. The most susceptible organisms were the Gram-positive B. subtilis and S. aureus followed by E. faecalis, usually resistant to most common antibiotics. Among the Gram-negative bacteria, E. coli and K. pneumoniae were highly sensitive to the different oil concentrations in the disc diffusion method. Finally, P. aeruginosa, a highly resistant organism to most antibiotics, showed moderate susceptibility to Satureja spicigera essential oil.
TI  - Characterization of the beneficial properties of lactobacilli isolated from bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) hatchery.
AB  - The present work addresses the isolation and partial identification of the microbial population of a R. catesbeiana hatchery in spring and summer as well as some beneficial properties of Lactobacillus strains isolated in different seasons and hatchery areas. The bacterial population was grouped into the following taxa: Lactobacillus spp., Pediococcus spp., Enterococcus faecalis and Ent. faecium, and Enterobacteriaceae (Enterobacter spp., Escherichia coli) while Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus epidermidis were isolated from frogs displaying red-leg syndrome. The Lactobacillus plantarum and L. curvatus strains isolated showed to inhibit the growth of red-leg syndrome associated pathogens and food-borne bacteria by organic acids. While L. plantarum CRL 1606 also inhibited red-leg syndrome related pathogens by hydrogen peroxide, meat spoilage bacteria were only inhibited by acidity. However, by using a MRS medium added with tetramethyl-benzidine and peroxidase, a high percentage of H(2)O(2)-producing lactobacilli were detected. The surface properties of Lactobacillus strains showed that a few strains were able to agglutinate ABO human erythrocytes, while the highest number of strains had a low to medium degree of hydrophobicity. This paper constitute the first study related to the beneficial properties of Lactobacillus isolated from a bullfrog hatchery, as well as the selection criteria applied to a group of strains, which could help to control or prevent bacterial infectious diseases in raniculture.
TI  - Leptoglycin: a new Glycine/Leucine-rich antimicrobial peptide isolated from the skin secretion of the South American frog Leptodactylus pentadactylus (Leptodactylidae).
AB  - Antimicrobial peptides are components of innate immunity that is the first-line defense against invading pathogens for a wide range of organisms. Here, we describe the isolation, biological characterization and amino acid sequencing of a novel neutral Glycine/Leucine-rich antimicrobial peptide from skin secretion of Leptodactylus pentadactylus named leptoglycin. The amino acid sequence of the peptide purified by RP-HPLC (C(18) column) was deduced by mass spectrometric de novo sequencing and confirmed by Edman degradation: GLLGGLLGPLLGGGGGGGGGLL. Leptoglycin was able to inhibit the growth of Gram-negative bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Citrobacter freundii with minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 8 microM, 50 microM, and 75 microM respectively, but it did not show antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Micrococcus luteus and Enterococcus faecalis), yeasts (Candida albicans and Candida tropicalis) and dermatophytes fungi (Microsporum canis and Trichophyton rubrum). No hemolytic activity was observed at the 2-200 microM range concentration. The amino acid sequence of leptoglycin with high level of glycine (59.1%) and leucine (36.4%) containing an unusual central proline suggests the existence of a new class of Gly/Leu-rich antimicrobial peptides. Taken together, these results suggest that this natural antimicrobial peptide could be a tool to develop new antibiotics.
TI  - Prevention of death in bacterium-infected mice by a synthetic antimicrobial peptide, L5, through activation of host immunity.
AB  - In our previous study, we found that the antibacterial peptide KLKLLLLLKLK-NH(2)  (L5) and its d-enantiomer (DL5) activate neutrophils to produce superoxide anions (O(2)(-)) and prevent death due to infection by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, suggesting that these peptides may elicit in vivo antimicrobial activities through host inflammatory responses mediated by neutrophils. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms behind in vivo antimicrobial prophylaxis by the use of L5 for the treatment of bacterial infection introduced via intra-abdominal implantation. We found that the intraperitoneal treatment with L5 before bacterial infection markedly reduced rates of death due to infection. Treatments with L5 were highly effective in preventing death due to intraperitoneal inoculation of not only S. aureus Smith but also Enterococcus faecalis SR1004 and Escherichia coli EC14. The intra-abdominal administration of L5 induced accumulation of neutrophils, increased levels of reactive oxygen species, and augmented antibacterial activity in the abdominal cavity. In addition, administration of L5 upregulated the expression of the Mig/CXCL9 chemokine gene in thioglycolate-elicited peritoneal macrophages. Our results suggested that the prevention of death by treatment of infected mice with L5 might occur primarily through the activation of a host immune response.
TI  - The antimicrobial effect of acetic acid--an alternative to common local antiseptics?
AB  - Acetic acid has been commonly used in medicine for more than 6000 years for the disinfection of wounds and especially as an antiseptic agent in the treatment and prophylaxis of the plague. The main goal of this study was to prove the suitability of acetic acid, in low concentration of 3%, as a local antiseptic agent, especially for use in salvage procedures in problematic infections caused by organisms such as Proteus vulgaris, Acinetobacter baumannii or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This study was designed to compare the in vitro antimicrobial effect of acetic acid with those of common local antiseptics such as povidone-iodine 11% (Betaisodona), polyhexanide 0.04% (Lavasept), mafenide 5% and chlohexidine gluconate 1.5% cetrimide 15% (Hibicet). Former studies suggest the bactericidal effect of acetic acid, but these data are very heterogeneous; therefore, a standardised in vitro study was conducted. To cover the typical bacterial spectrum of a burn unit, the following Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacterial strains were tested: Escherichia coli, P. vulgaris, P. aeruginosa, A. baumannii, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and beta-haemolytic Streptococcus group A and B. The tests showed excellent bactericidal effect of acetic acid, particularly with problematic Gram-negative bacteria such as P. vulgaris, P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii. The microbiological spectrum of acetic acid is wide, even when tested at a low concentration of 3%. In comparison to our currently used antiseptic solutions, it showed similar - in some bacteria, even better - bactericidal properties. An evaluation of the clinical value of topical application of acetic acid is currently underway. It can be concluded that acetic acid in a concentration of 3% has excellent bactericidal effect and, therefore, seems to be suitable as a local antiseptic agent, but further clinical studies are necessary.
TI  - Catheter-related urinary tract infection in patients suffering from spinal cord injuries.
AB  - Urinary tract infection is commoner in patients with spinal cord injuries because of incomplete bladder emptying and the use of catheters that can result in the introduction of bacteria into the bladder. 145 patients suffering from spinal cord injuries, admitted to the Institute for physical medicine and rehabilitation, Centre for paraplegia of the Clinical Centre of the University of Sarajevo, were included. The patients were divided in three groups according to the method of bladder drainage: Group A (n=61) consisted of patients on clean intermittent catheterization; Group B (n=54) consisted of patients with indwelling catheters; Group C (n=30) consisted of patients who had performed self-catheterization. From a total of 4539 urine samples, 3963 (87,3%) were positive and 576 (12,7%) were sterile. More than 90% of the infected patients were asymptomatic. The overall rate of urinary infection amounted to about 2,1 episodes, and bacteriuria to 8,1 episodes per patient. 77% of infections (113/145) were acquired within seven days from catheterization. Infection was usually polymicrobial; the greatest number of urine samples 1770/3943 (44,9%) included more than one bacterium. The vast majority of cases of urinary tract infection and bacteriuria are caused by Gram-negative bacilli and enterococci, commensal organisms of the bowel and perineum, representative of those from the hospital environment. Providencia stuarti (18,9%) being the most common, followed by Proteus mirabilis (16,3%), Escherichia coli (11,8%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10,2%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (8,1%), Morganella morgani (5,4%), Acinetobacter baumannii (4,6%), Providencia rettgeri (3,5%). 15,7% of isolates were Gram-positive with Enterococcus faecalis (8,6%) as the most common. 55,3% of isolates were multidrug-resistant, and the highest rates of resistance were found among Acinetobacter baumannii (87,8%), Providencia rettgeri (86,7%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (85,4%), Providencia stuarti (84,3%) and Morganella morgani (81,0%). Lower rates of resistance were found in Group C, i.e. patients on intermittent self-catheterisation. Eradication of organisms was achieved in only 53 (10,05%) of patients; hence, antibiotic therapy had no or very low effect. Significant correlations were found between the method of catheterization and the frequency of bacteriuria and urinary tract infections. The analysis of Group C showed a rate of lower urinary tract infection and bacteriuria than the other two Groups of patients. The objective of this study is the update of etiology and antimicrobial susceptibility in urinary tract infections in this group of patients. In addition, possible correlations between UTI and the type of bladder management were examined.
TI  - Community-acquired bacterial meningitis in elderly patients: experience over 30 years.
AB  - Clinical characteristics, etiologies, evolution, and prognostic factors of community-acquired bacterial meningitis in elderly patients are not well known. To improve this knowledge, all episodes of community-acquired bacterial meningitis were prospectively recorded and cases occurring in patients >or=65 years old were selected. During the period 1977-2006, 675 episodes in adults (aged >or=18 yr) were recorded, with 185 (27%) in patients aged >or=65 years old; 76 were male and 109 were female, with a mean age of 73 +/- 6 years (range, 65-93 yr). Causative microorganisms were Streptococcus pneumoniae 74, Neisseria meningitidis 49, Listeria monocytogenes 17, other streptococcal 9, Escherichia coli 6, Haemophilus influenzae 4, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus 2 each, Capnocytophaga canimorsus and Enterococcus faecalis 1 each, and unknown in 20. On admission 91% had had fever, 32% were in a coma (Glasgow Coma Scale <or=8), 9% presented with seizures, and 8% with shock. Thirty patients (16%) presented with seizures during therapy. Mortality was 58/185 (31%). Compared with patients aged 18-65 years, there were significant differences among older patients (aged >or=65 yr), who showed a higher frequency of diabetes and malignancy as underlying disease; pneumonia, otitis, and pericranial fistula as predisposing factors; and S. pneumoniae and L. monocytogenes as etiology. There were also differences in clinical presentation, complications, sequelae, and mortality. Factors independently related with mortality were age, pneumonia as a predisposing factor, coma on admission, and heart failure and seizures after therapy. Dexamethasone therapy was a protective factor. In conclusion, bacterial meningitis in elderly patients is associated with greater diagnostic difficulties and neurologic severity and more complications, as well as with increased mortality. Antiseizure prophylaxis might be useful in these patients.
TI  - Occurrence of ciprofloxacin-, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-, and vancomycin-resistant bacteria in a municipal wastewater treatment plant.
AB  - The occurrence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria was evaluated in aqueous samples  obtained from a municipal wastewater treatment plant. Samples collected from the influent, clarifier effluent, and disinfected effluent were assayed for fecal coliforms, E. coli, and enterococci exhibiting resistance to ciprofloxacin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and vancomycin. Membrane filtration of samples was followed by plating on growth media containing various concentrations of antibiotic. Bacterial colonies on plates with antibiotic exposures greater than the clinical minimum inhibitory concentrations were counted and considered resistant. The numbers of drug-resistant organisms in influent ranged from nondetectable to 7 x 10(5) colony-forming units (CFU)/100 mL for fecal coliforms, nondetectable to 5 x 10(4) CFU/100 mL for E. coli, and nondetectable to 6 x 10(5) CFU/100 mL for enterococci. Fecal coliforms, E. coli, and enterococci with reduced susceptibility to antibiotics were also detected in influent and clarifier effluent; however, the disinfected effluent did not contain resistant bacteria. Species-level identification of enterococci revealed that resistant enterococci were predominantly E. faecalis.
TI  - Clinical investigation of isolated bacteria from urinary tracts of hospitalized patients and their susceptibilities to antibiotics.
AB  - Complicated urinary tract infections (UTIs) are often difficult to treat, partly  because of the existence of isolated antibiotic-resistant strains. Even though the definition of UTI is determined by the quantity of cultured bacteria, it has been unclear if the quantity of cultured UTI bacteria affects their susceptibility to antimicrobial agents. Also, the gram stain is generally performed to assume the causative bacteria and their quantity before culture results can be obtained; therefore, we could start to use effective antibiotics if the relationship between bacterial quantity and resistance to antimicrobial agents were clear. We studied patients diagnosed as having complicated UTIs at the Urological Department in Kobe University Hospital between June 2002 and March 2003 and analyzed the relationships between the quantity of cultured bacteria and their antimicrobial MICs for antibiotics. The most commonly isolated bacteria were Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. There was no significant correlation between the quantity of cultured bacteria and antimicrobial MICs in all the bacteria and antibiotics that we tested, suggesting that resistant phenotype, but not inoculum of the organism, did determine resistance to antibiotics. In conclusion, our investigation suggested the total number of isolated bacteria in urine culture did not determine the MICs and that inoculum of the bacteria might be important for this determination.
TI  - Screening Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, and Clostridium perfringens as indicator organisms in evaluating pathogen-reducing capacity in biogas plants.
AB  - This study was conducted to identify an indicator organism(s) in evaluating the pathogen-reducing capacity of biogas plants. Fresh cow manure containing 10(4) to 10(5) colony forming unit (CFU) per milliliter of Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis along with an inoculated Clostridium perfringens strain were exposed to 37 degrees C for 15 days, 55 degrees C for 48 h, and 70 degrees C for 24 h. C. perfringens was the most heat-resistant organism followed by E. faecalis, while E. coli was the most heat-sensitive organism. E. coli was reduced below detection limit at all temperatures with log(10) reductions of 4.94 (10 s), 4.37 (40 min), and 2.6 (5 days) at 70 degrees C, 55 degrees C, and 37 degrees C, respectively. Maximum log(10) reductions for E. faecalis were 1.77 at 70 degrees C (1 day), 1.7 at 55 degrees C (2 days) and 3.13 at 37 degrees C (15 days). For C. perfringens, maximum log(10) reduction at 37 degrees C was 1.35 log(10) units (15 days) compared to less than 1 unit at 55 and 70 degrees C. Modeling results showed that E. faecalis and C. perfringens had higher amount of heat-resistant fraction than E. coli. Thus, E. faecalis and C. perfringens can be used as indicator organisms to evaluate pathogen-reducing capacity in biogas plants at high temperatures of 55 degrees C and 70 degrees C while at 37 degrees C E. coli could also be included as indicator organism.
TI  - 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy for identifying and quantifying common uropathogens: a metabolic approach to the urinary tract infection.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To address the shortcomings of urine culture for the diagnosis of urinary tract infection (UTI), we used 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy for identifying and quantifying Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumonia and Proteus mirabilis. PATIENTS, SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Urine samples from patients with suspected UTI (617), healthy volunteers (50) and commercially available standard strains of E. coli, K. pneumonia, P. aeruginosa, Enterobacter, Acinobacter, Pr. mirabilis, Citrobacter frundii, Streptococcus saprophyticus and Enterococcus faecalis were assessed between 2003 and 2006. 1H-NMR spectra were recorded on a 400 MHz spectrophotometer; to quantify the bacteria we estimated the areas under the spectral peaks of the specific metabolic product compared with the known concentration of trimethyl silyl propionic acid. All urine specimens were cultured in addition to an assessment by NMR spectroscopy. RESULTS: Preliminary urinary spectroscopy of the unprocessed samples showed peaks of nonspecific metabolites such as succinate, acetate, lactate and ethanol, indicating infected samples. Based on the results from processed samples, 93% (240/256) of E. coli, 92% (101/110) of K. pneumoniae, 93% (56/60) of P. aeruginosa and eight of 10 Pr. mirabilis could be diagnosed with NMR (numerator) and urine culture (denominator). The remaining samples were sterile and/or had a bacterial population of <10(3) colony-forming units (CFU)/mL. The NMR method diagnosed bacterial densities of >10(3) CFU. CONCLUSIONS: The identification of the common uropathogens E. coli, K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa and Pr. mirabilis by NMR spectroscopy has a shorter reporting time and can be used to differentiate between infected, contaminated and sterile specimens.
TI  - Screening of flavonoids as candidate antibiotics against Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - beta-Ketoacyl acyl carrier protein synthase (KAS) III, the most divergent member  of the condensing enzyme family, is a key catalyst in bacterial fatty acid biosynthesis and, thus, an attractive target for novel antibiotics. Here, we perform docking studies between Enterococcus faecalis KAS III (efKAS III) and one flavanone and 11 hydroxyflavanones with hydroxy groups at various positions. The MIC values of these flavanones for E. faecalis and vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis (VREF) were measured, and binding affinities to efKAS III were determined. Naringenin (9), eriodictyol (10), and taxifolin (12), with high-scoring functions and good binding affinities, docked well with efKAS III, resulting in MIC values in the range 128-512 microg/mL. Our results indicate that hydrogen bonds between the 5- and 4'-hydroxy groups and the side-chain of Arg38 and the backbone carbonyl of Phe308 are the key interactions for efKAS III inhibition. These flavanones are good candidate KAS III inhibitors and may be utilized as effective antimicrobials.
TI  - Biological activity evaluation of the oils from Laurus nobilis of Tunisia and Algeria extracted by supercritical carbon dioxide.
AB  - Isolation of essential oil from dried and ground leaves of Laurus nobilis L. from Algeria and Tunisia were obtained with two different methods: by means of classical hydrodistillation (HD) and by using carbon dioxide in the supercritical state (SFE). The effect of extraction pressure on the yield and composition of the L. nobilis volatile oil is examined. The best extraction conditions were as follows: pressure, 9.0 MPa; temperature, 323.15 K; 4 h of extraction and carbon dioxide flow, Phi = 1.2 kg h(-1). Waxes were entrapped in the first separator set at 9.0 MPa and 263.15 K. The oil was recovered in the second separator working at 2.0 bar and 288.15 K. GC/MS analysis of the leaves' volatile oil revealed that it mainly consisted of: 1,8-cineole, linalool, alpha-terpinyl acetate, methyl eugenol and sabinene. The comparison with the hydrodistilled oil did not reveal any big difference. The collection of samples at different extraction times during supercritical extraction allowed us to monitor the change of the oil composition. On the matrice exhaust owing to a SFE at 9.0 MPa, one further extraction at 323.15 K and 24.0 MPa was performed to obtain a mixture of compounds with higher molecular weight. Finally, the antibacterial and antifungal activity of the various extracts has been assayed.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of five herbal extracts against multi drug resistant (MDR) strains of bacteria and fungus of clinical origin.
AB  - Antimicrobial activities of the crude ethanolic extracts of five plants were screened against multidrug resistant (MDR) strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Candida albicans. ATCC strains of Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus bovis, Pseudimonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Candida albicans were also tested. The strains that showed resistance against the maximum number of antibiotics tested were selected for an antibacterial assay. The MDR strains were sensitive to the antimicrobial activity of Acacia nilotica, Syzygium aromaticum and Cinnamum zeylanicum, whereas they exhibited strong resistance to the extracts of Terminalia arjuna and Eucalyptus globulus. Community-acquired infections showed higher sensitivity than the nosocomial infections against these extracts. The most potent antimicrobial plant was A. nilotica (MIC range 9.75-313 microg/ml), whereas other crude plant extracts studied in this report were found to exhibit higher MIC values than A. nilotica against community acquired as well as nosocomial infection. This study concludes that A. nilotica, C. zeylanicum and S. aromaticum can be used against multidrug resistant microbes causing nosocomial and community acquired infections.
TI  - Regioselective synthetic approaches towards 1,2,8,9-tetraazadispiro[4.1.4.2]trideca-2,9-dien-6-ones of potential antimicrobial properties.
AB  - Reaction of 2,5-bis(arylmethylidene)cyclopentanones 1a-d with nitrilimines (generated in situ via triethylamine dehydrohalogenation of the corresponding hydrazonoyl chlorides 2a,b) in 1:2 molar ratio proceeds in a high regioselective manner affording monocycloadducts 3 and dicycloadducts in the form of two isomers 4, 5. Single crystal X-ray diffraction studies of the isolated crystalline form of 3c support the established structure and indicate that the formed product is 7E, 4S, 5R. Antimicrobial activity screening of the synthesized compounds 3-5, utilizing a variety of gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus fecalis and Streptococcus agalactiae), gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus vulgaris) and yeast (Candida albicans), exhibited that all the prepared analogues acquire promising activities against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria especially compounds 3b, 4a (antimicrobial active agents against gram-positive bacteria) and 3c (antimicrobial active agent against gram-negative bacteria).
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of bacterial pathogens causing urinary tract infections in a Saudi Arabian hospital.
AB  - The study describes the pathogens causing urinary tract infections (UTI) and the  antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of health care-associated (HCA) and community-acquired (CA) isolates. Of the total of 3,989 nonrepetitive urinary cultures, 4.7% (n=188) were HCA and 95.3% (n=3,801) were CA isolates. Gram-negative organisms totaled 3,607 (90.4%) vs. 9.6% Gram-positive organisms. In CA-UTI, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterococcus faecalis constituted 66, 11.4, and 5.4%, respectively. HCA-UTI episodes were caused by E. coli (37.8%), K. pneumoniae (14.4%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6.4%). The susceptibility rates of E. coli to ciprofloxacin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), nitrofurantoin and ceftriaxone in HCA and CA isolates were 53.3 and 74.1%, 42.2 and 62.7%, 32.5 and 97.0%, and 62.3 and 92.7%, respectively. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase production was detected in 8.1 and 7.4% isolates, respectively, of CA and HCA isolates of E. coli. CA isolates of K. pneumoniae were more susceptible to TMP-SMX (89.2 vs. 60.4%), ciprofloxacin (92.6 vs. 67.9%) and cefuroxime (93.8 vs. 24.5%) than HCA isolates. The susceptibility of HCA and CA isolates of E. faecalis to penicillin G and nitrofurantoin were 34.8 and 80%, and 78.3 and 93.6%, respectively (p<0.001). In conclusion, antimicrobial resistance is high to commonly used oral agents, rendering them inappropriate for empirical use.
TI  - Structural studies of the Enterococcus faecalis SufU [Fe-S] cluster protein.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Iron-sulfur clusters are ubiquitous and evolutionarily ancient inorganic prosthetic groups, the biosynthesis of which depends on complex protein machineries. Three distinct assembly systems involved in the maturation of cellular Fe-S proteins have been determined, designated the NIF, ISC and SUF systems. Although well described in several organisms, these machineries are poorly understood in Gram-positive bacteria. Within the Firmicutes phylum, the Enterococcus spp. genus have recently assumed importance in clinical microbiology being considered as emerging pathogens for humans, wherein Enterococcus faecalis represents the major species associated with nosocomial infections. The aim of this study was to carry out a phylogenetic analysis in Enterococcus faecalis V583 and a structural and conformational characterisation of it SufU protein. RESULTS: BLAST searches of the Enterococcus genome revealed a series of genes with sequence similarity to the Escherichia coli SUF machinery of [Fe-S] cluster biosynthesis, namely sufB, sufC, sufD and SufS. In addition, the E. coli IscU ortholog SufU was found to be the scaffold protein of Enterococcus spp., containing all features considered essential for its biological activity, including conserved amino acid residues involved in substrate and/or co-factor binding (Cys50,76,138 and Asp52) and, phylogenetic analyses showed a close relationship with orthologues from other Gram-positive bacteria. Molecular dynamics for structural determinations and molecular modeling using E. faecalis SufU primary sequence protein over the PDB:1su0 crystallographic model from Streptococcus pyogenes were carried out with a subsequent 50 ns molecular dynamic trajectory. This presented a stable model, showing secondary structure modifications near the active site and conserved cysteine residues. Molecular modeling using Haemophilus influenzae IscU primary sequence over the PDB:1su0 crystal followed by a MD trajectory was performed to analyse differences in the C-terminus region of Gram-positive SufU and Gram-negative orthologous proteins, in which several modifications in secondary structure were observed. CONCLUSION: The data describe the identification of the SUF machinery for [Fe-S] cluster biosynthesis present in the Firmicutes genome, showing conserved sufB, sufC, sufD and sufS genes and the presence of the sufU gene coding for scaffold protein, instead of sufA; neither sufE nor sufR are present. Primary sequences and structural analysis of the SufU protein demonstrated its structural-like pattern to the scaffold protein IscU nearby on the ISC machinery. E. faecalis SufU molecular modeling showed high flexibility over the active site regions, and demonstrated the existence of a specific region in Firmicutes denoting the Gram positive region (GPR), suggested as a possible candidate for interaction with other factors and/or regulators.
TI  - Novel E. coli beta-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthase III inhibitors as targeted antibiotics.
AB  - Beta-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthase (KAS) III is a condensing enzyme that initiates fatty acid biosynthesis in most bacteria. We determined three pharmacophore maps from receptor-oriented pharmacophore-based in silico screening of the X-ray structure of Escherichia coli KAS III (ecKAS III) and choose 16 compounds as candidate ecKAS III inhibitors. Binding inhibitors were characterized using saturation-transfer difference NMR spectroscopy (STD-NMR), and binding constants were determined with fluorescence quenching experiments. Based on the results, we propose that the antimicrobial compound, 4-cyclohexyliminomethyl-benzene-1,3-diol (YKAs3003), is a potent inhibitor of pathogenic KAS III, displaying minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values in the range 128-256 microg/mL against various bacteria.
TI  - Characterization and kinetics of phosphopantothenoylcysteine synthetase from Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - The enzyme phosphopantothenoylcysteine synthetase (PPCS) catalyzes the nucleotide-dependent formation of phosphopantothenoylcysteine from (R)-phosphopantothenate and L-cysteine in the biosynthetic pathway leading to the formation of the essential biomolecule, coenzyme A. The Enterococcus faecalis gene coaB encodes a novel monofunctional PPCS which has been cloned into pET23a and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 AI. The heterologous expression system yielded 30 mg of purified PPCS per liter of cell culture. The purified enzyme chromatographed as a homodimer of 28 kDa subunits on Superdex HR 200 gel filtration resin. The monofunctional protein displayed a nucleotide specificity for cytidine 5'-triphosphate (CTP) analogous to that seen for bifunctional PPCS expressed by most prokaryotes. Kinetic characterization, utilizing initial velocity and product inhibition studies, found the mechanism of PPCS to be Bi Uni Uni Bi Ping-Pong, with the nucleotide CTP binding first and CMP released last. Michaelis constants were 156, 17, and 86 microM for CTP, (R)-phosphopantothenate, and L-cysteine, respectively, and the k(cat) was 2.9 s(-1). [carboxyl-(18)O]Phosphopantothenate was prepared by hydrolysis of methyl pantothenate with Na(18)OH, followed by enzymatic phosphorylation with E. faecalis pantothenate kinase (PanK). The fate of the carboxylate oxygen of labeled phosphopantothenate, during the course of the PPCS-catalyzed reaction with CTP and L-cysteine, was monitored by (31)P NMR spectroscopy. The results show that the carboxylate oxygen of the phosphopantothenate is recovered with the CMP formed during the reaction, indicative of the formation of a phosphopantothenoyl cytidylate catalytic intermediate, which is consistent with the kinetic mechanism.
TI  - Isothiocyanate profile and selective antibacterial activity of root, stem, and leaf extracts derived from Raphanus sativus L.
AB  - Acetone and hexane extracts derived from the root, stem, and leaf of Raphanus sativus were investigated for their antibacterial activity against foodborne and resistant pathogens, such as Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Salmonella typhimurium, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, and Escherichia coli. Total and individual isothiocyanate (ITC) components and their relationship with the antibacterial activity of R. sativus were also evaluated. Both acetone and hexane fractions of root, stem, and leaf exhibited selective antibacterial activity against the organisms tested. Antibacterial activity was strongest in the acetone fraction of root with larger zone of inhibition and lower minimum inhibitory concentration. The results obtained were comparable to that seen with standard antibiotics. Of the different parts of R. sativus studied, root tended to be more active than the stem and leaf extracts in inhibiting the bacterial growth. Gas chromatographic analysis revealed the presence of variable amounts of five different ITCs such as allyl isothiocyanate (AITC), phenyl isothiocyanate (PITC), benzyl isothiocyanate (BITC), phenethyl isothiocyanate, and 4-(methylthio)-3-butenyl isothiocyanate (MTBITC) in different parts of the plant. The low linear correlation between the total ITC content and antibacterial activity implied that bacterial growth inhibitory ability of R. sativus was not dependent on the total ITC content. However, the antibacterial activity of R. sativus was well correlated with AITC, PITC, and BITC for all organisms except for Enteroc. faecalis, whose inhibitory effect was more related to MTBITC.
TI  - Insights into structure-activity relationships in the C-terminal region of divercin V41, a class IIa bacteriocin with high-level antilisterial activity.
AB  - Divercin V41 (DvnV41) is a class IIa bacteriocin with potent antilisterial activity isolated from Carnobacterium divergens V41. Previously, we expressed from a synthetic gene, in Escherichia coli Origami, a recombinant DvnV41 designated DvnRV41, which possesses four additional amino acids (AMDP) in the N-terminal region that result from enzymatic cleavage and retains the initial DvnV41 activity. To unravel the relationship between the structure of DvnRV41 and its particularly elevated activity, we produced by site-directed mutagenesis eight variants in which a single amino acid replacement was specifically introduced into the sequence. The point mutations were designed to change either conserved residues in class IIa bacteriocins or residues specific to DvnV41 located mainly in the C-terminal region. The fusion proteins were purified from the cytosoluble fractions by immobilized affinity chromatography. DvnRV41 and its variants were released from the fusion proteins by enzymatic cleavage, using enterokinase. The purity of DvnRV41 and of the variants was checked by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, high-performance liquid chromatography, and mass spectrometry. The antibacterial activity of DvnRV41 and its variants was assessed using different indicator strains, including Listeria monocytogenes EGDe and Enterococcus faecalis JH2-2. The activity of all of the variants appeared to be less than the activity of DvnRV41. The decrease in activity did not appear to be related to a global conformational change, as determined by circular dichroism. Overall, the variants of DvnRV41 produced in the present study provide interesting insights into structure-activity relationships of class IIa bacteriocins.
TI  - The impact of noncontact, nonthermal, low-frequency ultrasound on bacterial counts in experimental and chronic wounds.
AB  - Preventing wound infection and the development of resistant bacteria are important concerns in wound management. To determine if noncontact, nonthermal, low-frequency ultrasound therapy is effective in controlling wound bacterial colony counts, a series of four related experiments was conducted. First, ultrasound penetration in both wounded and intact skin was assessed in vitro. Compared to sham, noncontact ultrasound penetrated farther into both wounded (3 mm to 3.5 mm versus 0.35 mm to 0.50 mm) and intact (2.0 mm to 2.5 mm versus 0.05 mm to 0.07 mm, respectively) pig skin. Second, using an in vitro model to stain and count live/dead bacteria, 0% of sham treated and 33% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 40% of Escherichia coli and 27% of Enterococcus faecalis were dead after one ultrasound application. Minimal effects on methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and S. aureus were observed. Third, using an in vivo model, after 1 week, while differences between different bacterial species were observed, overall bacterial quantity decreased with ultrasound treatment (from 7.2 +/- 0.79 to 6.7 +/- 0.91 colony forming units per gram of tissue [CFU/g]) and silver antimicrobial dressings (from 7.2 +/- 0.79 to 5.7 +/- 0.6 CFU/g) but increased to 8.6 +/- 0.15 CFU/g for sham and 8.6 +/- 0.06 CFU/g for water-moistened gauze. Fourth, 11 patients (average age 60 years) with pressure ulcers containing bacterial counts >10(5) CFU/g of tissue received 2 weeks of noncontact ultrasound therapy. The quantities of seven bacterial organisms were reduced substantially from baseline to 2 weeks post treatment. None of the wounds exhibited signs of a clinical infection during the treatment period and no adverse events were observed. Taken together, these four studies indicate that noncontact ultrasound can be used to reduce bacterial quantity. Controlled clinical studies are warranted to ascertain the efficacy of this treatment and to further elucidate its effects on various Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of epidural infusions.
AB  - The incidence of epidural abscess following epidural catheterisation appears to be increasing, being recently reported as one in 1000 among surgical patients. This study was designed to investigate the antibacterial activity of various local anaesthetics and additives, used in epidural infusions, against a range of micro-organisms associated with epidural abscess. The aim was to determine which, if any, epidural infusion solution has the greatest antibacterial activity. Bupivacaine, ropivacaine and levobupivacaine crystals were dissolved and added to Mueller-Hinton Agar in concentrations of 0.06%, 0.125%, 0.2%, 0.25%, 0.5% and 1%. Fentanyl, adrenaline and clonidine were also mixed with agar in isolation and in combination with the local anaesthetics. Using a reference agar dilution method, the minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined for a range of bacteria. Bupivacaine showed antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli with minimum inhibitory concentrations between 0.125% and 0.25%. It did not inhibit the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa at any of the concentrations tested. Levobupivacaine and ropivacaine showed no activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, even at the highest concentrations tested, and minimal activity against Escherichia coli (minimum inhibitory concentrations 0.5% and 1% respectively). The presence of fentanyl, adrenaline and clonidine had no additional effect on the antibacterial activity of any of the local anaesthetic agents. The low concentrations of local anaesthetic usually used in epidural infusions have minimal antibacterial activity. While the clinical implications of this in vitro study are not known, consideration should be given to increasing the concentration of bupivacaine in an epidural infusion or to administering a daily bolus of 0.25% bupivacaine to reduce the risk of epidural bacterial growth.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activity of soft and purified propolis extracts].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the antimicrobial activity of soft and purified propolis extracts. STUDY OBJECT AND METHODS: Antimicrobial activity of soft and purified propolis extracts was determined with reference cultures of Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 33499, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Proteus mirabilis ATCC 12459, Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633, Bacillus cereus ATCC 8035, and fungus Candida albicans ATCC 60193. Microbiological tests were performed under aseptic conditions. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)--the highest dilution of preparation (the lowest concentration of preparation) that suppresses growth of reference microorganisms--was determined. RESULTS: Concentration of phenolic compounds in soft propolis extract that possesses antimicrobial activity against gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis) and gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus mirabilis) is 0.587+/-0.054 mg and 0.587+/-0.054-0.394+/-0.022 mg (P>0.05) and in purified propolis extract--0.427+/-0.044 mg and 0.256+/-0.02 mg (P>0.05). Klebsiella pneumoniae is most resistant to soft propolis extract when the concentration of phenolic compounds is 1.119+/- 0.152 mg and to purified propolis extract when the concentration of phenolic compounds is 1.013+/-0.189 mg (P>0.05). Spore-forming Bacillus subtilis bacteria are more sensitive to soft and purified propolis extracts when the concentration of phenolic compounds is 0.134+/-0.002 mg and 0.075+/-0.025 mg, respectively, and Bacillus cereus--when the concentration is 0.394+/-0.022 mg and 0.256+/-0.02 mg (P>0.05). Sensitivity of fungus Candida albicans to soft and purified propolis extracts is the same as Bacillus subtilis. Encapsulated bacterium Klebsiella pneumoniae is most resistant to antimicrobial action of soft and purified propolis extracts as compared with gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis bacteria (P<0.05), gram-negative Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus mirabilis (P<0.05), spore-forming Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus cereus bacteria (P<0.05), and fungus Candida albicans (P<0.05). There is no statistically significant difference between antimicrobial effect of soft propolis extract and purified propolis extract on gram-positive bacteria, gram-negative bacteria, spore-forming bacteria, encapsulated bacteria, and Candida fungus. CONCLUSIONS: Soft and purified propolis extracts possess antimicrobial activity. They could be recommended as natural preservatives in the manufacture of pharmaceutical products.
TI  - Comparing wastewater chemicals, indicator bacteria concentrations, and bacterial  pathogen genes as fecal pollution indicators.
AB  - The objective of this study was to compare fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) (fecal  coliforms, Escherichia coli [EC], and enterococci [ENT]) concentrations with a wide array of typical organic wastewater chemicals and selected bacterial genes as indicators of fecal pollution in water samples collected at or near 18 surface water drinking water intakes. Genes tested included esp (indicating human-pathogenic ENT) and nine genes associated with various animal sources of shiga-toxin-producing EC (STEC). Fecal pollution was indicated by genes and/or chemicals for 14 of the 18 tested samples, with little relation to FIB standards. Of 13 samples with <50 EC 100 mL(-1), human pharmaceuticals or chemical indicators of wastewater treatment plant effluent occurred in six, veterinary antibiotics were detected in three, and stx1 or stx2 genes (indicating varying animal sources of STEC) were detected in eight. Only the EC eaeA gene was positively correlated with FIB concentrations. Human-source fecal pollution was indicated by the esp gene and the human pharmaceutical carbamazepine in one of the nine samples that met all FIB recreational water quality standards. Escherichia coli rfbO157 and stx2c genes, which are typically associated with cattle sources and are of potential human health significance, were detected in one sample in the absence of tested chemicals. Chemical and gene-based indicators of fecal contamination may be present even when FIB standards are met, and some may, unlike FIB, indicate potential sources. Application of multiple water quality indicators with variable environmental persistence and fate may yield greater confidence in fecal pollution assessment and may inform remediation decisions.
TI  - Bacteremia coexisting with tophaceous gout of the spine mimicking spondylodiscitis: a case report.
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: A case report and review of the literature. OBJECTIVE: To report a  rare case of bacteremia coexisting with spinal gout initially suspected as pyogenic spondylodiscitis. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Gouty spine is a rare disease. It is even rare when coexisting with bacteremia. The presentation as pain, fever, and positive blood culture will make it more difficult to distinguish from spinal infection. METHODS: A 64-year-old woman with type II diabetes mellitus and chronic renal insufficiency was admitted to the emergency department with a fever of 39 degrees C, chills, and back pain. Laboratory studies revealed an elevated white count and neutrophils; her serum glucose level was 279 mg/dL. The C-reactive protein level was 25.55 mg/dL and serum uric acid was in the upper range of normal. Blood cultures revealed Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterococcus faecalis. Urine culture revealed 3 separate gram-negative bacilli. Magnetic resonance imaging of the spine revealed contrast enhancement in the L4-L5 and T5-T9 vertebral bodies. Infective spondylodiscitis of the lumbar and thoracic spine was suspected. RESULTS: Because antibiotic treatment had failed, surgical debridement with diskectomy, partial corpectomy, and allogenous strut graft reconstruction (T8-T9) was performed. During the operation, 600 cc of pleural effusion was drained. Chalky white material was noted at the T8-T9 disc and the adjacent vertebral bodies. Cultures for bacteria, tuberculosis, and fungus were all negative. Histologic examination revealed deposition of eosinophilic crystal-like material, and a diagnosis of tophaceous gout of the spine was established. CONCLUSION: This is, to our knowledge, the first case of bacteremia coexisting with multiple areas of tophaceous gout of the spine. Although uncommon, gouty spine should be added into the differential diagnosis of patients with back pain and bacteremia.
TI  - Blood stream infections in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients: reemergence of Gram-negative rods and increasing antibiotic resistance.
AB  - Blood stream infections (BSI) are a well-known cause of morbidity and mortality in hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) patients. The aim of this study was to analyze etiology and microbial resistance of BSI in patients undergoing allogeneic HSCT in a single center over a 4-year period (2004-2007). There were 168 episodes of BSI in 132 patients (median 10 days after HSCT) and 182 pathogens were isolated. Gram-positive bacteria (GPB) accounted for 57% of 182 isolates. Gram-negative rods (GNR) for 37% and fungi for 6%. All patients received routine fluoroquinolone prophylaxis. There was a significant decrease in GPB/GNR ratio over time, from 2.4 in 2004 to 1 in 2007 (P = .043). Among GPB, staphylococci decreased from 37 of 68 (64%) in 2004-2005 to 8 of 35 (23%) in 2006-2007 (P < .002). The Enterococcus faecalis/E. faecium ratio decreased from 4.5 in 2004 to 0.33 in 2007 (P = .006), whereas the total number of enterococcal strains per year did not change. The incidence of Escherichia coli among GNR increased from 3 of 15 (20%) in 2004 to 13 of 21 (62%) in 2007 (P = .003). Fluoroquinolone-resistance was common, both among GPB and GNR (81% and 74%, respectively). Mortality rate at 7 days after BSI was 11% (19 of 168), reaching 39% for Pseudomonas aeruginosa BSI (7 of 18). BSI remains a frequent and potentially life-threatening complication of allogeneic HSCT, the causative organism influencing 7- and 30-day mortality rate. BSI etiology may change rapidly, requiring implementation of new empirical-therapy schemes.
TI  - [Temporal and bacteriological comparison of neonatal urinary infections].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To find out the epidemiological and management changes of urinary tract infection over the last years. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Descriptive retrospective review of patients with urinary tract infections (UTIs) admitted to our neonatal unit over an 11 year period. A temporal, microorganism group and voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) group comparison. RESULTS: We studied 106 cases (5 cases/1,000 alive newborns). The most commonly isolated microorganisms were Escherichia coli (81.1%), Enterococcus faecalis (6.6%) and Enterobacter cloacae (4.7%). Gentamicin had an overall sensitivity of 93.2%, followed by cefotaxime 91.3% and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid 89.5%. We did not found temporal differences in microorganisms or sensitivities. We found differences in C reactive protein, nitrate and leucocyte values in E. coli versus non-E. coli UTIs, as well as patterns of antibiotic sensitivity with more resistances by non-E. coli microorganisms. No differences were found in patients with normal and pathological VCUG. We found ultrasound and VCGU disturbances in 35.2% and 21.4%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: UTI is a common problem in our area. The most frequently isolated microorganism is E. coli. Non-E. coli UTIs have more resistances to usual therapies, although these did not show any increase in disease in the imaging tests. We found no increase in resistances throughout the study.
TI  - Monitoring major mastitis pathogens at the population level based on examination  of bulk tank milk samples.
AB  - The objective was to determine the proportions and bacterial counts of major mastitis pathogens in samples of bulk tank milk (BTM), as well as to clarify the relationship between these bacteria counts and bulk tank somatic cell count (BTSCC). The purpose was to judge the importance of the counts of mammary pathogens for BTSCC at the population level. Samples of BTM were collected from 268 randomly selected anonymous dairy herds (with approximately 29 000 dairy cows). Staphylococcus aureus, other coagulase-positive staphylococci, Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus dysgalactiae were grouped as contagious pathogens, and Streptococcus uberis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium as environmental pathogens. Based on assessment of the dominant pathogen in each herd, environmental pathogens were found to dominate. Counts of specific mammary pathogens in BTM samples did not exceed a geometric mean of 1000 cfu/ml. Significant differences were documented in BTSCC between BTM samples containing Str. agalactiae, Staph. aureus, and Str. dysgalactiae and BTM samples that were pathogen-free. Geometric means of BTSCC associated with these pathogens were noticeably higher than the overall BTSCC (Str. agalactiae 243 628; Staph. aureus 205 610; Str. dysgalactiae 203 978; overall 173 000 cells/ml). It follows that the somatic cell count (SCC) associated with these pathogens contributed substantially to the overall BTSCC. Environmental pathogens predominated in samples of BTM with SCC <300x103/ml and contagious mastitis pathogens predominated in BTM samples with SCC >300x103/ml. No correlation was detected between bacterial counts of specific pathogens and BTSCC. This study revealed that the assessment of bacterial counts of mammary pathogens in samples of BTM in relation to BTSCC is applicable for the monitoring of changes in the occurrence of major mastitis pathogens in dairy herds at a national level.
TI  - Large scale multiplex PCR improves pathogen detection by DNA microarrays.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Medium density DNA microchips that carry a collection of probes for a broad spectrum of pathogens, have the potential to be powerful tools for simultaneous species identification, detection of virulence factors and antimicrobial resistance determinants. However, their widespread use in microbiological diagnostics is limited by the problem of low pathogen numbers in clinical specimens revealing relatively low amounts of pathogen DNA. RESULTS: To increase the detection power of a fluorescence-based prototype-microarray designed to identify pathogenic microorganisms involved in sepsis, we propose a large scale multiplex PCR (LSplex PCR) for amplification of several dozens of gene-segments of 9 pathogenic species. This protocol employs a large set of primer pairs, potentially able to amplify 800 different gene segments that correspond to the capture probes spotted on the microarray. The LSplex protocol is shown to selectively amplify only the gene segments corresponding to the specific pathogen present in the analyte. Application of LSplex increases the microarray detection of target templates by a factor of 100 to 1000. CONCLUSION: Our data provide a proof of principle for the improvement of detection of pathogen DNA by microarray hybridization by using LSplex PCR.
TI  - Evaluation of public health risks at recreational beaches in Lake Michigan via detection of enteric viruses and a human-specific bacteriological marker.
AB  - Each year the National Resource Defense Council addresses the quality of US beaches by routine bacterial indicators. In the Great Lakes region the indicator used is Escherichia coli and for 2007 more beaches were closed and impacted than ever before. In this study, water quality was addressed at two Lake Michigan Beaches over the 2004 swimming season by monitoring infectious enteric viruses by cell culture and integrated PCR and for a human sewage marker based on the Enterococcal Surface Protein (esp). Our goals for this study were to 1) examine the occurrence and variety of human enteric viruses present during peak usage of the beaches 2) determine key variables for development of predictive models for viruses; and 3) use quantitative risk assessment to estimate the potential health impact. Our results demonstrate that for both beaches predictive models of virus pollution were best described utilizing physical parameters like wind speed, wind direction and water temperature. The esp marker was not predictive of human viruses. The daily risk of acquiring a viral infection at either of the beaches ranged from 0.2 to 2.4/1000 swimmers using a quantitative microbial risk assessment model, with three swims during a day at the beach for children and over the season, the risk was 9-15/1000 swimmers using adenovirus as the model. CONCLUSIONS: Lake Michigan recreational beaches are being adversely impacted by human fecal pollution. Monitoring for the traditional indicators of water quality does not address viral risks and models can be developed and potentially used as real-time water quality forecasting tools.
TI  - Removal of radioisotopes in solution and bactericidal/bacteriostatic sterilising  power in activated carbon and metal silver filters.
AB  - Activated carbon filters play an important role in water filtration and purification from contaminants of different origin. Their limit consists in bacterial proliferation, which may occur only during prolonged periods of non-use and in their ability to remove radioactive contaminants present in waste water from Industry or Nuclear Medicine departments. In this work we tested a commercially available activated carbon filter for water purification enriched with silver plated parts incubating in static condition at room temperature different micro organisms (Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enteritidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Aspergillum niger), up to 78 days. The microbial growth was in general more inhibited in the presence of metal silver into the activated carbon in respect to filters with the activated carbon alone: >4log inhibition of bacterial proliferation after 78 days of incubation the presence of silver vs. 2log without silver. When the filters were incubated empty of carbon, the sterilizing power of silver was confirmed further. The activated carbon filters proved also their ability in removing from water the principal radioisotopes used for residues liquid medical and research purposes ((131)I, (99m)Tc, (201)Tl, (67)Ga). These results contribute useful data for the use of the silver-enriched carbon filters in water filtration both for daily use at home, and professional use in a Nuclear Medicine laboratory.
TI  - Evaluation of the antioxidant, antibacterial, and antiproliferative activities of the acetone extract of the roots of Senna italica (Fabaceae).
AB  - Senna italica, a member of the Fabaceae family (subfamily Caesalpinaceae), is widely used traditionally to treat a number of disease conditions, such as sexually transmitted diseases and some forms of intestinal complications. The roots of Senna italica were collected from Zebediela subregion, Limpopo province (S.A), powdered and extracted with acetone by cold/shaking extraction method. The phytochemical composition of the extract was determined by thin layer chromatography (TLC). The chromatograms were visualised with vanillin-sulphuric acid and p-anisaldehyde reagents. The total phenolic content of the extract was determined by Folin-Ciocalteu method and expressed as TAE/g dry weight. The extract was assayed for the in vitro anticancer activity using Jurkat T cells, antioxidant activity using DPPH assay and antibacterial activity by bioautographic method and the microtitre plate method. The acetone extract of the roots of Senna italica inhibited the growth of Jurkat T cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The extract also had free radical scavenging activity as well as reasonable antibacterial activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus with MICs ranging from 0,08 to 0.16 mg/ml in the same order as ampicillin the positive control. The biological activities observed in the acetone extract validated the ethnomedicinal use of Senna italica.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of extracts of three Croton species collected in Mpumalanga region in South Africa.
AB  - The antibacterial activities of three Croton species were compared using bioautography and the serial microdilution methods. The methanolic extracts of all the species had low activity against Escherichia coli. The highest activity was observed with Croton megalobotrys against Enterococcus faecalis with a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) value of 0.02 mg/ml. Croton steenkapianus extracts were the least active of the species investigated, only managing an MIC value of 0.625 mg/ml against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Croton megalobotrys leaf powder was serially extracted using solvents of various polarities. The lowest MIC value (0.06 mg/ml) of the serially extracted fractions was observed with acetone against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The liquid-liquid fractions of the methanol extract of Croton megalobotrys were also tested. The lowest MIC value of 0.02 mg/ml was observed with n-hexane fraction against Enterococcus faecalis. The carbon tetrachloride fraction was further fractionated using column chromatography with silica as the immobile phase. The resulting seven fractions were tested for activity following the bioassay-guided practice, and it emerged that the first three fractions had active compounds against Staphylococcus aureus when the bioautography method was used.
TI  - Detection of antimicrobial compounds by bioautography of different extracts of leaves of selected South African tree species.
AB  - The hexane, acetone, dichloromethane and methanol extracts of Combretum vendae A.E. van Wyk (Combretaceae), Commiphora harveyi (Engl.) Engl. (Burseraceae), Khaya anthotheca (Welm.) C.DC (Meliaceae), Kirkia wilmsii Engl. (Kirkiaceae), Loxostylis alata A. Spreng. ex Rchb. (Anacardiaceae), Ochna natalitia (Meisn.) Walp. (Ochnaceae) and Protorhus longifolia (Bernh. Ex C. Krauss) Engl. (Anacardiaceae) were screened for their antimicrobial activity. The test organisms included bacteria (Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus), and fungi (Aspergillus fumigatus, Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans, Microsporum canis and Sporothrix schenckii). A simple bioautographic procedure, involving spraying suspensions of the bacteria or fungi on thin layer chromatography (TLC) plates developed in solvents of varying polarities was used to detect the number of antibacterial and antifungal compounds present in the extracts. All the extracts had antimicrobial activity against at least one of the test microorganisms. This activity was denoted by white spots against a red-purple background on the TLC plates after spraying with tetrazolium violet. Twenty seven TLC plates; 9 for each solvent system and 3 different solvent systems per organism were tested in the bioautographic procedure. Of the bacteria tested, S. aureus was inhibited by the most compounds separated on the TLC plates from all the tested plants. Similarly, growth of the fungus C. neoformans was also inhibited by many compounds present in the extracts. Loxostylis alata appeared to be the plant extract with the highest number of inhibition bands when compared with other plants tested against both bacteria and fungi. This species was selected for in depth further study.
TI  - Constituents and antimicrobial properties of blue honeysuckle: a novel source for phenolic antioxidants.
AB  - The fruit of Lonicera caerulea L. (blue honeysuckle; Caprifoliaceae) and its phenolic fraction were analyzed for nutrients and micronutrients. The phenolic fraction was prepared from berries percolated with 0.1% H3PO4 and SPE using Sepabeads SP207. The sugar and lipid content was analyzed by HPLC and GC-MS. The total content of anthocyanins was determined using the pH differential absorbance method and aliphatic acids by capillary electrophoresis. MicroLC-MS/MS was used for determination of cyanidin-3-glucoside (the predominant anthocyanin), 3,5-diglucoside, and 3-rutinoside, paeonidin-3-glucoside, 3,5-diglucoside, and 3-rutinoside, delphinidin-3-glucoside and 3-rutinoside, pelargonidin-3-glucoside, 3,5-diglucoside, and 3-rutinoside, quercetin, its 3-glucoside, and 3-rutinoside, epicatechin, protocatechuic, gentisic, ellagic, ferulic, caffeic, chlorogenic, and coumaric acids. The phenolic fraction displayed Folin-Ciocalteu reagent reducing (335 +/- 15 microg of gallic acid equivalent/mg) and DPPH and superoxide scavenging activity (IC50 12.1 +/- 0.1 and 115.5 +/- 6.4 microg/mL) and inhibited rat liver microsome peroxidation (IC50 160 +/- 20 microg/mL). The freeze-dried fruit and its phenolic fraction reduced the biofilm formation and adhesion to the artificial surface of Candida parapsilosis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus mutans.
TI  - Update on antimicrobial susceptibility rates among gram-negative and gram-positive organisms in the United States: results from the Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TEST) 2005 to 2007.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TTEST) is a global surveillance study initiated in 2004.Its goal is to assess the in vitro activity of the glycylcycline, tigecycline, and comparator antimicrobials. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to measure the in vitro activity of a panel of antimicrobial agents against gram-negative and gram-positive organisms collected in the United States in 2005, 2006, and 2007. METHODS: Isolates were collected from 172 centers across the United States.In vitro activity was assessed using Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines and CLSI or US Food and Drug Administration interpretive criteria. RESULTS: Overall, data on 20,897 gram-negative and 8949 gram-positive isolates were collected. For the majority of organisms, percentage susceptibilities were unchanged over the 3 years of collection. One exception was Acinetobacter baumannii; rates of susceptibility to the majority of agents in the panel decreased by approximately 10% over the 3 years. Rates of resistant phenotypes were relatively unchanged with mean percentages over the 3 years of: 8.9% (337/3787) for extended beta-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae; 2.1% (17/801) for ESBL-producing Klebsiella oxytoca; 2.3% (111/4861) for ESBL-pproducing Escherichia coli; 56.2% (2564/4560) for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus; 5.1% (97/1903) for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis; and 67.2% (487/725) for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium. The minimum inhibitory concentration required to inhibit the growth of 90% of organisms (MIC(90)) for tigecycline was stable over the 3 years and was < or = 22 mg/L against non-ESBL-producing K pneumoniae, K oxytoca, E coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, and A baumannii. Against methicillin susceptible and -resistant S aureus, E faecalis, E faecium, and Streptococcus agalactiae tigecycline MIC(90)s were < or = 0.25 mg/L. CONCLUSIONS: This report of 3 years of data from the TEST study suggests stable susceptibility rates among gram-negative and gram-positive organisms, with the exception of decreased susceptibility rates for A baumannii. Tigecycline continued to have good activity against Enterobacteriaceae, A baumannii, S aureus, E faecalis, E faecium, and S agalactiae.
TI  - Microbiological evaluation of fecal bacterial composition from surface water through aquifer sand material.
AB  - When bacterial pathogens from livestock contaminate drinking water supplies, they can cause different forms of gastroenteritis. The objective of this study was to enumerate the concentrations of fecal indicator (Escherichia coli and enterococci) in surface water in order to determine removal efficiency by sand filtration. The concentrations of different indicator bacterial species were determined after running tertiary treated water through two tanks containing aquifer material. Enterococcus faecalis primers targeting the ddl gene and primers for Enterococcus faecium were used to identify the two species in the samples. A PCR assay based on the partial sequence of the 13-D-glucoronidase gene (uidA) for specific detection and differentiation of E. coli populations was used to confirm the presence of E. coli after a biochemical test. The biochemical test overestimated the percentage of E. faecium in our samples, but the PCR assay with the ddl gene produced 100% specificity with Enterococcus faecalis. The biochemical test was 91.5% specific in identifying E. coli. The composition of indicator bacteria in Santa Ana River was dominated by intestinal microflora of humans and animals; filtration by aquifer sand material may reduce the transport of indicator bacteria from surface water to groundwater.
TI  - Antibacterial effects of five different root canal sealing materials.
AB  - The aim of this in vitro study was to assess the antibacterial effects of gray and white mineral trioxide aggregate (GMTA and WMTA), calcium hydroxide (CH), Portland cement (PC) and a new endodontic cement (NEC) on various species of microorganisms, using agar diffusion test. A base layer of Petri plates was made using Muller-Hinton agar. Five cavities were made in agar and filled with fresh mixed materials after 24 h. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and a mixture of these bacteria were seeded by pour plate. The plates were preincubated for 2 h at room temperature followed by incubation at 37 degrees C. The inhibition zone diameters were measured at 24, 48 and 72 h. The highest mean diameters of growth inhibition zones were observed around NEC and CH. According to one-way ANOVA, there was a significant difference among test groups (P < 0.001), while post-hoc test revealed no significant difference between the mean zone diameters of NEC and CH, and also between MTAs and PC. However, there was a significant difference between CH and NEC in comparison with MTAs and PC groups (P < 0.001). It appears that NEC may act as a potent antibacterial agent similar to CH.
TI  - DNA gyrase (GyrB)/topoisomerase IV (ParE) inhibitors: synthesis and antibacterial activity.
AB  - The synthesis and antibacterial activities of three chemotypes of DNA supercoiling inhibitors based on imidazolo[1,2-a]pyridine and [1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyridine scaffolds that target the ATPase subunits of DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV (GyrB/ParE) is reported. The most potent scaffold was selected for optimization leading to a series with potent Gram-positive antibacterial activity and a low resistance frequency.
TI  - Transport of selected bacterial pathogens in agricultural soil and quartz sand.
AB  - The protection of groundwater supplies from microbial contamination necessitates  a solid understanding of the key factors controlling the migration and retention of pathogenic organisms through the subsurface environment. The transport behavior of five waterborne pathogens was examined using laboratory-scale columns packed with clean quartz at two solution ionic strengths (10 mM and 30 mM). Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Yersinia enterocolitica were selected as representative Gram-negative pathogens, Enterococcus faecalis was selected as a representative Gram-positive organism, and two cyanobacteria (Microcystis aeruginosa and Anabaena flos-aquae) were also studied. The five organisms exhibit differing attachment efficiencies to the quartz sand. The surface (zeta) potential of the microorganisms was characterized over a broad range of pH values (2-8) at two ionic strengths (10 mM and 30 mM). These measurements are used to evaluate the observed attachment behavior within the context of the DLVO theory of colloidal stability. To better understand the possible link between bacterial transport in model quartz sand systems and natural soil matrices, additional experiments were conducted with two of the selected organisms using columns packed with loamy sand obtained from an agricultural field. This investigation highlights the need for further characterization of waterborne pathogen surface properties and transport behavior over a broader range of environmentally relevant conditions.
TI  - A signaling protease required for melanization in Drosophila affects resistance and tolerance of infections.
AB  - Organisms evolve two routes to surviving infections-they can resist pathogen growth (resistance) and they can endure the pathogenesis of infection (tolerance). The sum of these two properties together defines the defensive capabilities of the host. Typically, studies of animal defenses focus on either understanding resistance or, to a lesser extent, tolerance mechanisms, thus providing little understanding of the relationship between these two mechanisms. We suggest there are nine possible pairwise permutations of these traits, assuming they can increase, decrease, or remain unchanged in an independent manner. Here we show that by making a single mutation in the gene encoding a protease, CG3066, active in the melanization cascade in Drosophila melanogaster, we observe the full spectrum of changes; these mutant flies show increases and decreases in their resistance and tolerance properties when challenged with a variety of pathogens. This result implicates melanization in fighting microbial infections and shows that an immune response can affect both resistance and tolerance to infections in microbe-dependent ways. The fly is often described as having an unsophisticated and stereotypical immune response where single mutations cause simple binary changes in immunity. We report a level of complexity in the fly's immune response that has strong ecological implications. We suggest that immune responses are highly tuned by evolution, since selection for defenses that alter resistance against one pathogen may change both resistance and tolerance to other pathogens.
TI  - Antibacterial 5'-O-(N-dipeptidyl)-sulfamoyladenosines.
AB  - The aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (aaRS) class of enzymes is a validated target for antimicrobial development. Aminoacyl analogues of 5'-O-(N-L-aminoacyl)-sulfamoyladenosines are known to be potent inhibitors of aaRS, but whole cell antibacterial activity of these compounds is very limited, and poor penetration into bacteria has been proposed as the main reason for this. Aiming to find derivatives that better penetrate bacteria, we developed a simple and short method to prepare dipeptidyl-derivatives of 5'-O-(N-L-aminoacyl)-sulfamoyladenosines, and used this method to prepare 18 5'-O-(N-dipeptidyl)-sulfamoyladenosines. The antibacterial activity of these derivatives and a number of reference compounds against S. aureus, E. faecalis and E. coli was determined. Several of the new derivatives showed improved antibacterial activity and an altered spectrum of antibacterial activity.
TI  - Hylin a1, the first cytolytic peptide isolated from the arboreal South American frog Hypsiboas albopunctatus ("spotted treefrog").
AB  - RP-HPLC fractionation of the electrically stimulated skin secretion of the arboreal South American frog Hypsiboas albopunctatus ("spotted treefrog") led to the isolation of a cytolytic C-terminally amidated peptide. This novel peptide, named hylin a1 (Hy-a1), consists of 18 amino acid residues (IFGAILPLALGALKNLIK-NH(2)). The alpha-helical structure of the synthetic hylin a1 peptide was confirmed by CD spectroscopy in the presence of 60% (v/v) TFE. The synthetic peptide displayed broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria including Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and also against fungi (Candida albicans, C. krusei, C. parapsilosis and Cryptococcus neoformans). Hylin a1 was also able to disrupt human erytrocytes (HC(50)=18 microM). Similarity analysis using PSI-BLAST revealed 50-44% of identity to maximins Hv, H16, H15 and H10 from Bombina maxima and also to hylins b1 and b2 (Hy-b1 and Hy-b2) from Hypsiboas lundii (synonym: Hyla biobeba).
TI  - Microbiological and toxicological effects of Perla black bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) extracts: in vitro and in vivo studies.
AB  - We investigated the microbiological and toxicological effects of three Perla black bean extracts on the growth and culture of selected pathogenic microorganisms, the toxicity over Vero cell lines and an in vivo rat model. Three different solvents were used to obtain Perla black bean extracts. All three Perla black bean extracts were tested for antibacterial and antiparasitic activity and further analysed for intrinsic cytotoxicity (IC(50)). Methanol Perla black bean extract was used for acute toxicity test in rats, with the up-and-down doping method. All Perla black bean extracts inhibited bacterial growth. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus vulgaris, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Listeria monocytogenes showed inhibition, while Escherichia coli and Enterobacter aerogenes did not. Acidified water and acetic acid Perla black bean extract were tested in parasites. The best IC(50) was observed for Giardia lamblia, while higher concentrations were active against Entamoeba histolytica and Trichomonas vaginalis. The Vero cells toxicity levels (IC(50)) for methanol, acidified water and acetic acid Perla black bean extract were [mean +/- S.D. (95% CI)]: 275 +/- 6.2 (267.9-282.0), 390 +/- 4.6 (384.8-395.2) and 209 +/- 3.39 (205.6-212.4) microg/ml, respectively. In vivo acute toxicity assays did not show changes in absolute organ weights, gross and histological examinations of selected tissues or functional tests. The acetic acid and methanol Perla black bean extract proved to exhibit strong antibacterial activity and the acidified water Perla black bean extract exerted parasiticidal effects against Giardia lamblia, Entamoeba hystolitica and Trichomonas vaginalis. The three Perla black bean extracts assayed over Vero cells showed very low toxicity and the methanol Perla black bean extract in vivo did not cause toxicity.
TI  - Antifungal and antibacterial activity of the newly synthesized 2-xanthone derivatives.
AB  - A series of 2-substituted xanthone derivatives 8-20 containing selected allyl, cinnamyl, morpholine, and imidazole moieties were synthesized and tested for their antifungal and antibacterial in-vitro properties. Of the newly synthesized derivatives, ten revealed antifungal activity especially against Trichophyton mentagrophytes (the biggest inhibition zones ranged 35 mm for 11 and 13). 2-(3-(Allylamino)propoxy)-9H-xanthen-9-one hydrochloride 9 inhibited growth of all of the examined fungal species. Significant efficacy against evaluated yeasts and dermatophytes was also observed for 6-chloro-2-methyl-9H-xanthen-9-one derivatives 11-13 containing encyclic amine moieties. Additionally, compounds 9, 11, and 12 hindered development of bacteria species but in a lesser degree. They were efficacious against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Enterococcus faecalis.
TI  - One-pot synthesis of 5-phenylimino, 5-thieno or 5-oxo-1,2,3-dithiazoles and evaluation of their antimicrobial and antitumor activity.
AB  - We here report the synthesis and biological evaluation of rare 4-substituted-5-phenylimino, 5-thieno- and 5-oxo-1,2,3-dithiazoles. Dithiazoles were selectively obtained in moderate to high yields (25-73%) via a one-pot reaction from various ethanoneoximes with sulfur monochloride, pyridine in acetonitrile followed by treatment by corresponding nucleophiles (aniline, thioacetamide and formic acid). All the synthesized compounds were screened for their antibacterial (against bacteria Escherichia coli, Salmonellaenterica serovar Typhimurium, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus cereus and Listeria inocua), antifungal (against pathogenic strains Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, Candida tropicalis and Issatchenkia orientalis) and antitumor (on human cell lines MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231) activity. 4-(2-Pyridinyl)-5H-1,2,3-dithiazole-5-thione and 4-ethylcarboxyl-5H-1,2,3-dithiazole-5-thione (5d, 5h) that are active against Gram-positive bacteria are significantly active against fungi. 4-(2-Benzofuranyl)-5-phenylimino-5H-1,2,3-dithiazole (4e) exerts antiproliferative activity.
TI  - Environmental occurrence of the enterococcal surface protein (esp) gene is an unreliable indicator of human fecal contamination.
AB  - The enterococcal surface protein (esp) gene found in Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium has recently been explored as a marker of sewage pollution in recreational waters but its occurrence and distribution in environmental enterococci has not been well-documented. If the esp gene is found in environmental samples, there are potential implications for microbial source tracking applications. In the current study, a total of 452 samples (lake water, 100; stream water, 129; nearshore sand, 96; and backshore sand, 71; Cladophora sp. (Chlorophyta), 41; and periphyton (mostly Bacillariophyceae), 15) collected from the coastal watersheds of southern Lake Michigan were selectively cultured for enterococci and then analyzed for the esp gene by PCR, targeting E. faecalis/ E. faecium (esp(fs/fm)) and E. faecium (esp(fm)). Overall relative frequencies for esp(fs/fm) and esp(fm) were 27.4 and 5.1%. Respective percent frequency for the esp(fs/fm) and esp(fm) was 36 and 14% in lake water, 38.8 and 2.3% in stream water, 24 and 6.3% in nearshore sand; 0% in backshore sand; 24.4 and 0% in Cladophora sp.; and 33.3 and 0% in periphyton. The overall occurrence of both esp(fs/fm) and esp(fm) was significantly related (chi2 = 49, P < 0.0001). Post-rain incidence of esp(fs/fm) increased in lake and stream water and nearshore sand. Further, E. coli and enterococci cell densities were significant predictors for esp(fs/fm) occurrence in post-rain lake water, but esp(fm) was not F+ coliphage densities were not significant predictors for esp(fm) or esp(fs/fm) gene incidence. In summary, the differential occurrence of the esp gene in the environment suggests that it is not limited to human fecal sources and thus may weaken its use as a reliable tool in discriminating contaminant sources (i.e., human vs. nonhuman).
TI  - In vitro activity of tigecycline: MICs, MBCs, time-kill curves and post-antibiotic effect.
AB  - The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs), minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs), time-kill curves, and postantibiotic effect (PAE) of tigecycline, the first in the glycylcycline class of antibiotics, were evaluated. MICs were determined against 749 clinical isolates. Time-kill curves were performed against two isolates each of Enterococcus faecalis, MSSA, and MRSA. The presence of PAE, against the same isolates, was investigated. MIC(90)s (microg/mL) were the following: Escherichia coli 0.25; Klebsiella spp 0.5; Enterobacter spp 1; Acinetobacter spp. 2; Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA+MRSA) 0.25; CNS (MS+MR) 0.25; vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis 0.12. Tigecycline exerted bacteriostatic activity against all the tested isolates, MBC(90)values being 32xMIC. Time-kill experiments showed a marked reduction in bacterial growth. A PAE at 1- to 20-fold the MIC was observed against the two enterococcal isolates (1.5-3.2h, range) and the four staphylococci (1.6-3h, range). Our findings confirm the excellent antimicrobial activity of tigecycline, adding informations on its bacteriostatic activity vs enterococci and staphylococci, whether methicillin-resistant or -susceptible, and its PAE.
TI  - Novel pyridazine derivatives: Synthesis and antimicrobial activity evaluation.
AB  - A general method for the preparation of new hydrazones is reported. The 1-[4-(2-methoxybenzyl)-6-aryl pyridazin-3(2H)-ylidene] hydrazines or their tautomeric structures (1(a-d)) were condensed with different aldehydes, dialdehydes, ketones, alpha-dicarbonyl compounds and simple carbohydrates to afford the hydrazones and dihydrazones (2(a-d)), (3(a-d)), (4(a-d)), (5(a-d)), (6(d)), (7(c)), (8(a-d)), (9(a-d)), (10(a-d)), (11(a-d)), (12(a,c,d)), (13(a-d)), (14(a-d)), (15(a-d)), (16(a-d)) and (17(a-d)). The structures of all synthesized compounds were confirmed from microanalytical and spectral data. Some of the products were screened for their antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The hydrazone derivative 15(d) (1-[4-(2-methoxybenzyl)-6-methylphenyl pyridazin-3(2H)-ylidene]-2-(2-carboxydiphenyl methyl) hydrazine) showed the highest biological activity.
TI  - Isoflavonoid glycosides from the roots of Baphia bancoensis.
AB  - Chemical investigation of the methanol extract of the roots of Baphia bancoensis  led to the isolation and characterization of three new isoflavonoid glycosides (1-3). Their structures were determined on the basis of spectroscopic studies andchemical evidence. Antibacterial activity of isolated compounds was evaluated against Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of tigecycline and other antimicrobials against Gram-negative and Gram-positive organisms collected from the Asia-Pacific Rim as part of the Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TEST).
AB  - As part of the Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TEST), Gram-negative and Gram-positive organisms were collected from 31 medical centres in nine countries in the Asia-Pacific Rim between 2004 and 2007. Overall, 34.2% of Acinetobacter spp. were multidrug-resistant, and 17.0% of Klebsiella pneumoniae and 10.6% of Escherichia coli produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamases. A total of 39.5% of Staphylococcus aureus were meticillin-resistant and 21.7% of Enterococcus faecium were vancomycin-resistant. Tigecycline MIC(90) values (minimum inhibitory concentration for 90% of the organisms) were <or=2mg/L against Acinetobacter spp., K. pneumoniae, E. coli, Enterobacter spp. and Serratia marcescens and <or=0.25mg/L against S. aureus, E. faecalis and Enterococcus faecium. Antimicrobial resistance is widespread in the Asia-Pacific Rim. Tigecycline has excellent in vitro activity against a broad spectrum of bacteria, including resistant strains.
TI  - Bacteriology of non-surgical wound infections in Ibadan, Nigeria.
AB  - Previous studies done on wound infections in this environment had been mostly on  the surgical variety rather than the non-surgical. However,few studies available on the non-surgical type have indicated that changes do occur in the pattern and antibiogram of the bacterial isolates of these non-surgical wound infections. This study was therefore designed to investigate the bacteriology of non-surgical wound infections in this environment. A retrospective review of seven hundred and fifty four cases of non-surgical wound infections was conducted between September 2002 and February 2005 at the University College Hospital, Ibadan, Nigeria. A total number of 871 bacterial, and seven fungal isolates were obtained from these wound cultures. In 477 (70.3%) cases, cultures were monomicrobial and 202 (29.8%) polymicrobial. Staphylococcus aureus (38%) was the predominant pathogen, followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (18.7%), Klebsiella species (17%), Escherichia coli (10.6%), Proteus species (7.4%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (4.4%), Streptococcus species (1.6%), Enterococcus faecalis (1.4%), and Candida albicans (0.8%). High rates of antibiotic resistance were recorded among these isolates. 53.4% of them were sensitive to ceftriaxone, 42.5% to gentamycin and 39.3% to ofloxacin. This high antibiotic resistance gives credence to the value of determining the antibiogram of these pathogens in their management. Continuous interaction between the wound care practitioners and microbiology department is also advocated.
TI  - Role of human CD36 in bacterial recognition, phagocytosis, and pathogen-induced JNK-mediated signaling.
AB  - Scavenger receptor CD36 mediates Staphylococcus aureus phagocytosis and initiates TLR2/6 signaling. We analyzed the role of CD36 in the uptake and TLR-independent signaling of various bacterium, including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella typhimurium, S. aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis. Expression of human CD36 in HeLa cells increased the uptake of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria compared with the control mock-transfected cells. Bacterial adhesion was associated with pathogen phagocytosis. Upon CD36 transfection, HEK293 cells, which demonstrate no TLR2/4 expression, acquired LPS responsiveness as assessed by IL-8 production. The cells demonstrated a marked 5- to 15-fold increase in cytokine release upon exposure to gram-negative bacteria, while the increase was much smaller (1.5- to 3-fold) with gram-positive bacteria and lipoteichoic acid. CD36 down-regulation utilizing CD36 small interfering RNA reduced cytokine release by 40-50% in human fibroblasts induced by both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria as well as LPS. Of all MAPK signaling cascade inhibitors tested, only the inhibitor of JNK, a stress-activated protein kinase, potently blocked E. coli/LPS-stimulated cytokine production. NF-kappaB inhibitors were ineffective, indicating direct TLR-independent signaling. JNK activation was confirmed by Western blot analyses of phosphorylated JKN1/2 products. Synthetic amphipathic peptides with an alpha-helical motif were shown to be efficient inhibitors of E. coli- and LPS-induced IL-8 secretion as well as JNK1/2 activation/phosphorylation in CD36-overexpressing cells. These results indicate that CD36 functions as a phagocytic receptor for a variety of bacteria and mediates signaling induced by gram-negative bacteria and LPS via a JNK-mediated signaling pathway in a TLR2/4-independent manner.
TI  - Immunoadjuvant effects of bacterial genomic DNA and CpG oligodeoxynucleotides on  avian influenza virus subtype H5N1 inactivated oil emulsion vaccine in chicken.
AB  - This study investigated the immunoadjuvant effects of three types of bacterial genomic DNA and CpG oligonucleotides (CpG ODN) on the avian influenza virus (AIV) subtype H5N1 inactivated oil emulsion vaccine under two immunization strategies. The genomic DNA extracted from Escherichia coli O(2), Staphylococcus aureus,Streptococcus faecalis FQ68, and synthetic CpG ODN were used as adjuvants, and their effects on the AIV oil emulsion vaccine were examined in chickens. The results indicated that when administered separately from the vaccine, adjuvants induced lower haemagglutination inhibition (HI) titres and serum IgG titres but resulted in higher concentrations of IFN-gamma and IL-10. In contrast, when combined with the oil emulsion vaccine prior to inoculation, CpG ODN induced higher HI, IgG titres and IFN-gamma concentration but resulted in lower IL-10 concentration. These data suggest that, depending on the immunization approaches, adjuvants may exert distinct immune effects in chickens receiving AIV H5N1 oil emulsion vaccine: the prior incorporation of CpG ODN into the vaccine may augment both the humoral and Th1 type immune responses, while separate inoculation of adjuvants has not shown better adjuvanticity.
TI  - [Veterinary probiotic preparation influence on the biochemical blood indices of young farm animals].
AB  - The veterinary probiotic preparation was developed on the basis of aerobic part of bacterial strains of normal human intestinal microflora: 3 strains of Escherichia coli--G35No1-413, G35No2-412, G35No3-411, and one Enterococcus faecalis G35No4-410 strain. The influence of a pilot lot of the prepapration on the biochemical blood indices and the state of intestinal microflora of different age groups of young farm animal (calves and piglets) was studied during the process of the commission tests. It has been shown, that the developed probiotic promotes the improvement of protein and mineral metabolism, normalization of level of enzyme activities, which show state of the native immunity of the young farm animals' organism. It was the result of normalization of the intestinal microflora composition. The optimal doses and periods of intake have been determined. On the basis of executed researches the veterinary probiotic preparation has been presented for registration to the State Department of Veterinary Medicine of Ukraine.
TI  - Dual fluorescence system for flow cytometric analysis of Escherichia coli transcriptional response in multi-species context.
AB  - When studying interspecies interactions in a bacterial consortium, it may be desirable to analyze one species' transcriptional response as influenced by the other species. We developed a dual fluorescence system of Escherichia coli for Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorter (FACS)-based analysis for such a purpose. First, we generated E. coli SCC1 strain, which constitutively expresses green fluorescent protein (GFP), but otherwise showed no observable difference from the parent strain MG1655 with respect to morphology, growth, and FACS-analyzed side- and forward-scatter profiles. Next, to analyze transcriptional response, plasmids carrying promoters of interest fused to a red fluorescent protein (AsRed2) reporter, were introduced into strain SCC1. Quantification of promoter activities of araB, lacZ, fadB and rpoE via AsRed2 reporter verified that the induction levels are similar between MG1655 and SCC1 strains. In mixtures and co-cultures, GFP expression of E. coli SCC1 allowed it to be separated from non-E. coli species by FACS to purity levels of 96.7-100.0%. When a mixture of E. coli SCC1 carrying promoter-AsRed2 fusion and a non-E. coli strain was analyzed by FACS, it enabled (i) distinction of E. coli SCC1 from the non-E. coli strain, (ii) analysis of the E. coli promoter activity via AsRed2 expression and (iii) identification of transcriptional heterogeneity within the E. coli population. Co-cultures of E. coli SCC1 with Klebsiella pneumoniae and/or Enterococcus faecalis analyzed by FACS showed that E. coli fadB and rpoE transcription were differentially influenced by partner species.
TI  - Antimicrobial effects of two anaesthetic agents: dexmedetomidine and midazolam.
AB  - Some anaesthetic agents are known to inhibit microbial growth. The aim of this in vitro study was to investigate possible antimicrobial effects of two frequently used agents in intensive care units, dexmedetomidine and midazolam. Antimicrobial effect was tested on Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa by broth microdilution method. Midazolam showed inhibitor and bactericidal effect on S. aureus at concentrations 256 mmicrog x ml(-1) and 512/microg x ml(-1) respectively and on E. faecalis at concentrations 128 microg x ml(-1) and 256 microg x ml(-1). Dexmedetomidine demonstrated inhibitor effect on S. aureus, E. coli and P aeruginosa at concentrations 32 microg x ml(-1), 16 microg x ml(-1) and 16 microg x ml(-1) respectively. Midazolam had inhibitor and bactericidal effects on S. aureus and E. faecalis. Dexmedetomidine had only inhibitor effects on S. aureus, E. coli and P aeruginosa. Further studies are needed to determine the antimicrobial mechanisms and clinical applications.
TI  - Normal intestinal flora of wild Nile crocodiles (Crocodylus niloticus) in the Okavango Delta, Botswana.
AB  - Bacterial and fungal cultures were performed from cloacal swabs collected from 29 wild Nile crocodiles, captured in the Okavango Delta, Botswana. Sixteen species of bacteria and 6 fungal species were cultured. Individual crocodiles yielded 1-4 bacterial species, and 0-2 fungal species. The most commonly isolated bacteria were Microbacterium, Enterococcus faecalis, Aeromonas hydrophila, and Escherichia coli. No salmonellae were cultured. The most commonly occurring fungus was Cladosporium. Several of the bacterial and fungal species isolated have been implicated in cases of septicaemia in crocodilians. Knowledge of the normal intestinal flora will contribute towards the development of a crocodile-specific probiotic for use in farmed crocodiles.
TI  - Virulent synergistic effect between Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli assayed by using the Caenorhabditis elegans model.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The role of enterococci in the pathogenesis of polymicrobial infections is still debated. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of virulent enterococci in the presence or absence of Escherichia coli strains in the in vivo Caenorhabditis elegans model. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: This study demonstrated that there was a synergistic effect on virulence when an association of enterococci and E. coli (LT50 = 1.6 days+/-0.1 according to the tested strains and death of nematodes in 4 days+/-0.5) was tested in comparison with enterococci alone (LT50 = 4.6 days+/-0.1 and death in 10.4 days+/-0.6) or E. coli alone (LT50 = 2.1+/-0.9 and deaths 6.6+/-0.6) (p<0.001). In addition, there was a relation between the virulence of E. faecalis strains alone and the virulence potential of the association with E. coli strains. Finally, in the presence of avirulent E. coli strains, enterococci have no effect (LT50 = 4.3+/-0.5 and deaths in 10.8+/-0.8), independently of the level of their own virulence, demonstrating that the 'enterococci effect' only occurred in the presence of virulent E. coli strains. CONCLUSION: This study allows a better understanding of a bacterial cooperation. Moreover, it could help to optimize the antibiotic regimen during polymicrobial infections.
TI  - The Orf18 gene product from conjugative transposon Tn916 is an ArdA antirestriction protein that inhibits type I DNA restriction-modification systems.
AB  - Gene orf18, which is situated within the intercellular transposition region of the conjugative transposon Tn916 from the bacterial pathogen Enterococcus faecalis, encodes a putative ArdA (alleviation of restriction of DNA A) protein. Conjugative transposons are generally resistant to DNA restriction upon transfer to a new host. ArdA from Tn916 may be responsible for the apparent immunity of the transposon to DNA restriction and modification (R/M) systems and for ensuring that the transposon has a broad host range. The orf18 gene was engineered for overexpression in Escherichia coli, and the recombinant ArdA protein was purified to homogeneity. The protein appears to exist as a dimer at nanomolar concentrations but can form larger assemblies at micromolar concentrations. R/M assays revealed that ArdA can efficiently inhibit R/M by all four major classes of Type I R/M enzymes both in vivo and in vitro. These R/M systems are present in over 50% of sequenced prokaryotic genomes. Our results suggest that ArdA can overcome the restriction barrier following conjugation and so helps increase the spread of antibiotic resistance genes by horizontal gene transfer.
TI  - Ursolic, oleanolic and betulinic acids: antibacterial spectra and selectivity indexes.
AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Ursolic acid (UA), oleanolic acid (OA) and betulinic acid (BA), three hydroxyl pentacyclic triterpenoic acids (HPTAs) naturally found in a large variety of vegetarian foods, medicinal herbs and plants have been investigated for antibacterial activity. AIM OF THE STUDY: To determine the antibacterial activity of UA, OA and BA, as well as the toxic impact on eukaryotic cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined against five reference strains (Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 & ATCC 29213, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853), as well as five antibiotic-resistant clinical isolates. Toxicity was evaluated against MRC-5 and HaCaT cell lines. RESULTS: No antibacterial activity was observed for BA; while OA and more particularly UA, did show a moderate to good antibacterial activity, but limited to Gram-positive bacteria. Nevertheless, OA and UA were devoid of antibacterial activities against clinical isolates. Moreover, viability and cytotoxic assays demonstrated that the three compounds induced a significant cytotoxicity. CONCLUSIONS: Despite of a relative similar chemical structure; UA, OA and BA harboured different antibacterial activities, with more significant ones for UA. However, considering both viability and toxicity values, these compounds seem to have a significant impact on eukaryotic cell viability.
TI  - Reduction in infection risk through treatment of microbially contaminated surfaces with a novel, portable, saturated steam vapor disinfection system.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Surface-mediated infectious disease transmission is a major concern in various settings, including schools, hospitals, and food-processing facilities. Chemical disinfectants are frequently used to reduce contamination, but many pose significant risks to humans, surfaces, and the environment, and all must be properly applied in strict accordance with label instructions to be effective. This study set out to determine the capability of a novel chemical-free, saturated steam vapor disinfection system to kill microorganisms, reduce surface-mediated infection risks, and serve as an alternative to chemical disinfectants. METHODS: High concentrations of Escherichia coli, Shigella flexneri, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (VRE), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Salmonella enterica, methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, MS2 coliphage (used as a surrogate for nonenveloped viruses including norovirus), Candida albicans, Aspergillus niger, and the endospores of Clostridium difficile were dried individually onto porous clay test surfaces. Surfaces were treated with the saturated steam vapor disinfection system for brief periods and then numbers of surviving microorganisms were determined. Infection risks were calculated from the kill-time data using microbial dose-response relationships published in the scientific literature, accounting for surface-to-hand and hand-to-mouth transfer efficiencies. RESULTS: A diverse assortment of pathogenic microorganisms was rapidly killed by the steam disinfection system; all of the pathogens tested were completely inactivated within 5 seconds. Risks of infection from the contaminated surfaces decreased rapidly with increasing periods of treatment by the saturated steam vapor disinfection system. CONCLUSIONS: The saturated steam vapor disinfection system tested for this study is chemical-free, broadly active, rapidly efficacious, and therefore represents a novel alternative to liquid chemical disinfectants.
TI  - Isolated peptidoglycan glycosyltransferases from different organisms produce different glycan chain lengths.
AB  - Peptidoglycan is an essential component of bacterial cell wall. The glycan strands of peptidoglycan are synthesized by enzymes called peptidoglycan glycosyltransferases (PGTs). Using a high-resolution SDS-PAGE assay, we compared the glycan strand lengths of four different PGTs from three different organisms (Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus aureus). We report that each enzyme makes a polymer having an intrinsic characteristic length that is independent of the enzyme:substrate ratio. The glycan strand lengths vary considerably, depending on the enzyme. These results indicate that each enzyme must have some mechanism, as yet unknown, for controlling product length. The observation that different PGTs produce different length glycan chains may have implications for their cellular roles and for the three-dimensional structure of bacterial peptidoglycan.
TI  - Synthesis and biological activities of new hydrazide derivatives.
AB  - The synthesis of a new series of imidazo[1,2-a]pyrazine-2-carboxylic acid arylidene-hydrazides is described. The chemical structures of the compounds were elucidated by IR, (1)H-NMR, FAB(+)-MS spectral data. Their biological activity against various bacteria, fungi species, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis was investigated. Antibacterial activity was measured against Escherichia coli (NRRL B-3704), Staphylococcus aureus (NRRL B-767), Salmonella typhimurium (NRRL B-4420), Proteus vulgaris (NRLL B-123), Enterococcus faecalis (isolated obtained from Faculty of Medicine Osmangazi University, Eskisehir, Turkey), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (NRRL B-23 27853), Klebsiella spp. (isolated obtained from Faculty of Medicine Osmangazi University, Eskisehir, Turkey), while antifungal activity was evaluated against Candida albicans (isolates obtained from Osmangazi Uni. Fac.of Medicine), Candida glabrata (isolates obtained from Osmangazi Uni. Fac.of Medicine). Compounds were also evaluated for antituberculosis activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H(37)Rv using the BACTEC 460 radiometric system and BACTEC 12B medium. The compounds showed moderate inhibitor effects against human pathogenic microorganisms., whereas the preliminary results indicated that all of the tested compounds were inactive against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H(37)Rv.
TI  - Antimicrobial effects of Turkish propolis, pollen, and laurel on spoilage and pathogenic food-related microorganisms.
AB  - The antimicrobial activities of propolis extract, pollen extract, and essential oil of laurel (Laurus nobilis L.) at concentrations from 0.02% to 2.5% (vol/vol) were investigated on bacteria (Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus, Yersinia enterocolitica, Enterococcus faecalis, and Listeria monocytogenes), yeasts (Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida rugosa), and molds (Aspergillus niger and Rhizopus oryzae). Pollen has no antimicrobial effects on the bacteria and fungi tested in the concentrations used. Propolis showed a bactericidal effect at 0.02% on B. cereus and B. subtilis, at 1.0% on S. aureus and E. faecalis, and at 0.2% on L. monocytogenes. The minimum inhibitory concentration of propolis for fungi was 2.5%. Propolis and laurel were ineffective against E. coli and S. typhimurium at the concentrations tested. The results showed that the antimicrobial activity were concentration dependent. Propolis and essential oil of laurel may be used as biopreservative agents in food processing and preservation.
TI  - Expression, purification and activities of the entire family of intact membrane sensor kinases from Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - Two-component signal transduction systems are the main mechanism by which bacteria sense and respond to their environment, and their membrane-located histidine protein kinases generally constitute the sensory components of these systems. Relatively little is known about their fundamental mechanisms and precise nature of the molecular signals sensed, because of the technical challenges of producing sufficient quantities of these hydrophobic membrane proteins. This study evaluated the heterologous production, purification and activities of the 16 intact membrane sensor kinases of Enterococcus faecalis. Following the cloning of the genes into expression plasmid pTTQ18His, all but one kinase was expressed successfully in Escherichia coli inner membranes. Purification of the hexa-histidine 'tagged' recombinant proteins was achieved for 13, and all but one were verified as intact. Thirteen intact kinases possessed autophosphorylation activity with no added signal when assayed in membrane vesicles or as purified proteins. Signal testing of two functionally-characterized kinases, FsrC and VicK, was successful examplifying the potential use of in vitro activity assays of intact proteins for systematic signal identification. Intact FsrC exhibited an approximately 10-fold increase in activity in response to a two-fold molar excess of synthetic GBAP pheromone, whilst glutathione, and possibly redox potential, were identified for the first time as direct modulators of VicK activity in vitro. The impact of DTT on VicK phosphorylation resulted in increased levels of phosphorylated VicR, the downstream response regulator, thereby confirming the potential of this in vitro approach for investigations of modulator effects on the entire signal transduction process of two-component systems.
TI  - A new tetracycline efflux gene, tet(40), is located in tandem with tet(O/32/O) in a human gut firmicute bacterium and in metagenomic library clones.
AB  - The bacterium Clostridium saccharolyticum K10, isolated from a fecal sample obtained from a healthy donor who had received long-term tetracycline therapy, was found to carry three tetracycline resistance genes: tet(W) and the mosaic tet(O/32/O), both conferring ribosome protection-type resistance, and a novel, closely linked efflux-type resistance gene designated tet(40). tet(40) encodes a predicted membrane-associated protein with 42% amino acid identity to tetA(P). Tetracycline did not accumulate in Escherichia coli cells expressing the Tet(40) efflux protein, and resistance to tetracycline was reduced when cells were incubated with an efflux pump inhibitor. E. coli cells carrying tet(40) had a 50% inhibitory concentration of tetracycline of 60 microg/ml. Analysis of a transconjugant from a mating between donor strain C. saccharolyticum K10 and the recipient human gut commensal bacterium Roseburia inulinivorans suggested that tet(O/32/O) and tet(40) were cotransferred on a mobile element. Sequence analysis of a 37-kb insert identified on the basis of tetracycline resistance from a metagenomic fosmid library again revealed a tandem arrangement of tet(O/32/O) and tet(40), flanked by regions with homology to parts of the VanG operon previously identified in Enterococcus faecalis. At least 10 of the metagenomic inserts that carried tet(O/32/O) also carried tet(40), suggesting that tet(40), although previously undetected, may be an abundant efflux gene.
TI  - In vitro bactericidal activity of recombinant human beta-defensin-3 against pathogenic bacterial strains in human tooth root canal.
AB  - Human beta-defensin-3 (HBD3), an endogenous antimicrobial peptide, has strong broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. This study aimed to obtain recombinant HBD3 (rHBD3) and to test the hypothesis that the antimicrobial characteristics of HBD3 may offer an advantage over conventional medicine in reducing intracanal bacteria. Genetic engineering was used to obtain active rHBD3 and analysis revealed that it exhibited a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity at low micromolar concentrations against not only Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli but also against some critical pathogenic microbes in infected root canals, including Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella melaninogenica, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Streptococcus mutans, Actinomyces naeslundii, Enterococcus faecalis and Candida albicans. In an in vitro antibacterial experiment, rHBD3 significantly eliminated pathogenic bacteria in root canals. The ratio of bacterial death was up to 98%. We conclude that HBD3 has the potential to eliminate bacteria effectively and rapidly in the local microenvironment of the root canal system and that it may contribute to successful endodontic treatment.
TI  - Synthesis, characterization and antimicrobial activity of Co(II), Zn(II) and Cd(II) complexes with N-benzyloxycarbonyl-S-phenylalanine.
AB  - In this paper the first complexes of M(2+) ions (M(2+) = Zn(2+), Cd(2+) and Co(2+)) with N-benzyloxycarbonyl-S-phenylalaninato ligand (1-3) are described. The new complexes were characterized by means of elemental analysis, IR and UV-vis spectroscopy, molar conductivity measurements and (1)H, (13)C and (15)N NMR spectroscopy (1D and 2D). The Co(II) complex adopts an octahedral geometry, and the Zn(II) and Cd(II) complexes adopt a tetrahedral one. For the first time, the antimicrobial activity of N-benzyloxycarbonyl-S-phenylalaninato ligand (N-Boc-S-phe) and the complexes 1-3 was investigated against gram-positive: Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis and Bacillus subtilis and gram-negative bacteria: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and two strains of the yeast Candida albicans. It was shown that the complexes were effective against most strains. The best activity was detected against the yeast C. albicans.
TI  - Functional role of Trp-105 of Enterococcus faecalis azoreductase (AzoA) as resolved by structural and mutational analysis.
AB  - Enterococcus faecalis azoreductase (AzoA) is a very active enzyme with a broad spectrum of substrate specificity and is capable of degrading various azo dyes. The enzyme has an absolute requirement for reduced FMN, which delivers a total of four electrons from NADH to the substrate, resulting in the cleavage of the nitrogen double bond. In this study, we report the identification of amino acid residues critical for FMN binding in AzoA. FMN is stabilized by 22 amino acid residues, eight of which, Trp-105, Asn-106, Leu-107, Gly-150, Gly-151, Tyr-153, Asn-121 and Tyr-129, are involved in binding the FMN isoalloxazine ring. In silico analysis of the amino acid residues revealed that the Trp residue at position 105 of AzoA is the most likely significant contributor to the binding of FMN to the enzyme and is involved in FMN stabilization and destabilization. Site-directed mutagenesis analysis of Trp-105 was performed to determine the role of this amino acid residue in FMN binding and azo dye reductive activity. The mutant proteins were overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified by anion-exchange and size-exclusion chromatography. The replacement of Trp-105 by the small side-chain amino acids Ala and Gly caused complete loss of both affinity for FMN and enzyme activity. Substitution of Tyr for Trp-105 did not significantly decrease the V(max) of the enzyme (22 % reduction). Substitutions with three bulky side-chain amino acids, Gln, Phe and His, produced enzymes with lower V(max) values (decreases of 68.2, 30.6 and 8.2-fold, respectively). However, these mutated enzymes maintained K(m) values similar to the wild-type enzyme. This study provides an insight into the catalytic properties of AzoA in FMN stabilization and enzyme activity.
TI  - Antibacterial Activity of Barringtonia acutangula against Selected Urinary Tract  Pathogens.
AB  - Barringtonia acutangula (L.) Gaertn belonging to family Barringtoniaceae was investigated to evaluate In vitro antibacterial activity of aqueous, ethanolic, petroleum ether and chloroform extracts against Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli the major urinary tract infection causing pathogens were tested by disc diffusion assay method and the minimum inhibitory concentration was evaluated. Ethanol (95%) extract exhibited broader spectrum of inhibition followed by chloroform, petroleum ether and aqueous extracts against the urinary tract pathogens under test. An attempt has been made to compare the activity of extracts with standard antibiotics against selected urinary tract infection causing pathogens.
TI  - Urinary infections due to multi-drug-resistant Escherichia coli among persons with HIV disease at a tertiary AIDS care centre in South India.
AB  - BACKGROUND: While the spectrum of opportunistic infections due to HIV infection has been widely discussed, there are very limited data available in south India on certain incident infections especially urinary tract infections (UTI) in HIV-infected subjects. METHODS: Bacterial aetiology of 350 symptomatic UTI in HIV-infected subjects and the drug resistance pattern of the Escherichia coli isolates tested between June 2005 and July 2007 at the YRG Centre for AIDS Research and Education, a tertiary HIV Referral Centre in Chennai has been described here. RESULTS: E. coli was the most common etiological agent of UTI in HIV patients, followed by Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus spp. and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Twenty-nine E. coli isolates were multi-drug-resistant and 83.3% of the isolates were resistant to sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim. CONCLUSIONS: Urinary pathogens in HIV-infected patients demonstrate high antimicrobial resistance and with majority of therapy for UTIs being empiric, constant updates of the aetiological agents and their drug susceptibility pattern would largely be beneficial to clinicians in choosing the right drug.
TI  - Effect of triclosan on the formation of crystalline biofilms by mixed communities of urinary tract pathogens on urinary catheters.
AB  - The crystalline bacterial biofilms that encrust Foley catheters compromise the care of many elderly and disabled patients. The aim of this study was to examine whether the biocide triclosan can prevent encrustation by the mixed flora of uropathogens that commonly infect patients undergoing long-term catheterization. Models of the catheterized bladder were inoculated with communities of organisms isolated from patients who were experiencing catheter blockage. The catheter retention balloons were inflated with water or triclosan (3 g triclosan l(-1) in 0.1 M sodium carbonate) and urine was supplied to the models for up to 7 days. The effect of triclosan was recorded on the viable cell populations, the pH of the residual urine and the times that catheters took to block. The extent of encrustation of the catheters was visualized by scanning electron microscopy. In models inoculated with communities containing Proteus mirabilis, triclosan prevented the rise in urinary pH that drives crystalline biofilm formation and catheter blockage. The biocide had no effect on populations of Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were eliminated from the residual urine and the catheters drained freely for the 7-day experimental period. In models inoculated with a mixed community containing Providencia rettgeri, catheters inflated with triclosan continued to block rapidly. Although K. pneumoniae and Proteus vulgaris were eliminated from the residual urine, there was no effect on the viability of Providencia rettgeri. The results indicate that the triclosan strategy should be limited to the treatment of patients who are infected with Proteus mirabilis.
TI  - A potential plasmid-curing agent, 8-epidiosbulbin E acetate, from Dioscorea bulbifera L. against multidrug-resistant bacteria.
AB  - Bioassay-guided fractionation of an aqueous methanolic extract of Dioscorea bulbifera L. bulbs was performed using organic solvents. A novel plasmid-curing compound was identified as 8-epidiosbulbin E acetate (EEA) (norditerpene) on the basis of modern spectroscopic analysis and X-ray crystallography. EEA exhibited broad-spectrum plasmid-curing activity against multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria, including vancomycin-resistant enterococci. EEA cured antibiotic resistance plasmids (R-plasmids) from clinical isolates of Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Shigella sonnei and Pseudomonas aeruginosa with 12-48% curing efficiency. The reference plasmids of Bacillus subtilis (pUB110), E. coli (RP4), P. aeruginosa (RIP64) and Salmonella typhi (R136) were cured with efficiency ranging from 16% to 64%. EEA-mediated R-plasmid curing decreased the minimal inhibitory concentration of antibiotics against MDR bacteria, thus making antibiotic treatment more effective. The antibiotic resistance pattern revealed that the compound was effective in the reversal of bacterial resistance to various antibiotics. In addition, the compound did not show any cytotoxicity against a broad range of human cancer cell lines, namely MCF-7 (breast cancer), SiHa (cervical cancer) and A431 (epidermal carcinoma), and hence has the potential to be used as a lead compound for drug discovery programmes.
TI  - [Effect of metal microelements on biochemical indices of probiotic bacteria].
AB  - The influence of metal-microelements (Zn, Cu, Ag, Au) in colloid and ionic form on the main biochemical parameters (ATP-ase activity, transmembrane potential and respiratory activity) of E. coli G35 N#1-413 and Ent. faecalis G35 N#4-410 probiont-strains has been studied with the goal to create complex metal-bearing probiotic preparations. Monotonous dose-dependent inhibitory influence of all mentioned metals in ionic form on the bacteria functional activity has been established. Metals' colloids had certainly stimulating influence on microorganisms' biochemical parameters in the same concentration limits with the following maximum positive effects: for Zn - 2x10(-7)-2x10(-4) mg/ml, for Cu - 8.4x10(-7)-8.4x10(-6) microg/ml, for Ag - 23x10(-7)-23x10(-4) microg/ml, for Au - 5x10(-6) microg/ml by metals. It has been shown, that cultural characteristics of probiont-bacteria in the presence of both ionic and colloid forms of studied metals remain stable. Certain stimulation of probiont-bacteria' main enzymes and life-support processes by colloidal forms of the studied metals-microelements in determined concentration and particle dimension limits is the evidence of a possibility of metals' colloids application in probiotic preparations' composition in order to increase the resistance and functional activity of probiont-microorganisms.
TI  - Differentiation of Streptococcus pneumoniae conjunctivitis outbreak isolates by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry.
AB  - Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus [Pnc]) is a causative agent of many infectious diseases, including pneumonia, septicemia, otitis media, and conjunctivitis. There have been documented conjunctivitis outbreaks in which nontypeable (NT), nonencapsulated Pnc has been identified as the etiological agent. The use of mass spectrometry to comparatively and differentially analyze protein and peptide profiles of whole-cell microorganisms remains somewhat uncharted. In this report, we discuss a comparative proteomic analysis between NT S. pneumoniae conjunctivitis outbreak strains (cPnc) and other known typeable or NT pneumococcal and streptococcal isolates (including Pnc TIGR4 and R6, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus pseudopneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes) and nonstreptococcal isolates (including Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus aureus) as controls. cPnc cells and controls were grown to mid-log phase, harvested, and subsequently treated with a 10% trifluoroacetic acid-sinapinic acid matrix mixture. Protein and peptide fragments of the whole-cell bacterial isolate-matrix combinations ranging in size from 2 to 14 kDa were evaluated by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. Additionally Random Forest analytical tools and dendrogramic representations (Genesis) suggested similarities and clustered the isolates into distinct clonal groups, respectively. Also, a peak list of protein and peptide masses was obtained and compared to a known Pnc protein mass library, in which a peptide common and unique to cPnc isolates was tentatively identified. Information gained from this study will lead to the identification and validation of proteins that are commonly and exclusively expressed in cPnc strains which could potentially be used as a biomarker in the rapid diagnosis of pneumococcal conjunctivitis.
TI  - Cranberry derived proanthocyanidins reduce bacterial adhesion to selected biomaterials.
AB  - Catheter associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI) linked with the uropathogens Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis) account for the majority of nosocomial infections acquired in the clinical environment. Because these infections develop following initial adhesion of the bacterial pathogens to the catheter surface, there is increased interest in developing effective methods to inhibit attachment of cells to biomaterials used in the manufacture of indwelling devices. High molecular weight proanthocyanidins (PAC) extracted from the North American cranberry (Vaccinium macrocarpon) were examined for their potential to reduce the initial adhesion of uropathogenic bacteria (E. coli CFT073 and E. faecalis 29212) to two model biomaterials, poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). Well-controlled experiments conducted in a parallel-plate flow chamber (PPFC) demonstrated decreased attachment of both bacteria to PVC and PTFE when either the bacteria, biomaterial or both surfaces were treated with PAC. Most significant inhibition of bacterial adhesion was observed for the condition where both the bacteria and biomaterial surfaces were coated with PAC. Additional experiments conducted with nonbiological model particles demonstrate comparable extents of adhesion inhibition, supporting a nonbiospecific mechanism of PAC action. The results of this study are promising for the implementation of PAC in the clinical milieu for prevention of device associated infection as the proposed functional modification is independent of antibacterial mechanisms that may give rise to resistant strains.
TI  - Surfactants as microbicides and contraceptive agents: a systematic in vitro study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The urgent need for cheap and easy-to-use protection against both unwanted pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases has stimulated considerable interest in the use of surfactants as microbicides, anti-viral, and contraceptive agents in recent years. In the present study we report a systematic in vitro evaluation of the microbicidal, anti-viral and contraceptive potential of cationic, anionic, zwitterionic, and non-ionic surfactants. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Toxicity was evaluated in mammalian columnar epithelial (MDCK) cells, human sperm cells, Candida albicans, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Streptococcus agalactiae and Enterococcus faecalis. The inhibition of adenovirus and lentivirus infection of MDCK cells was also tested. A homologous series of cationic surfactants, alkyl-N,N,N-trimethylammonium bromides (C(n)TAB), with varying alkyl chains were shown to be bactericidal and fungicidal at doses that were related to the surfactant critical micelle concentrations (CMC), all of them at concentrations significantly below the CMC. In general, bacteria were more susceptible to this surfactant group than C. albicans and this organism, in turn, was more susceptible than MDCK cells. This suggests that the C(n)TAB may be useful as vaginal disinfectants only in so far as bacterial and fungal infections are concerned. None of the surfactants examined, including those that have been used in pre-clinical studies, showed inhibition of adenovirus or lentivirus infection of MDCK cells or spermicidal activity at doses that were sub-toxic to MDCK cells. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The results of this study lead us to propose that systematic analysis of surfactant toxicity, such as we report in the present work, be made a mandatory pre-condition for the use of these substances in pre-clinical animal and/or human studies.
TI  - Surface antimicrobial activity and biocompatibility of incorporated polyethylenimine nanoparticles.
AB  - The antimicrobial effect and biocompatibility of insoluble cross-linked quaternary ammonium polyethylenimine (PEI) nanoparticles incorporated at 1 or 2%w/w in a resin composite were assayed. The antimicrobial effect against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli was tested using the direct contact test (DCT), agar diffusion test (ADT) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Biocompatibility was tested by assessing macrophage viability, and TNFalpha secretion. Samples incorporating 2%w/w nanoparticles inhibited the growth of all bacterial strains tested. Reducing the amount of the added nanoparticles to 1%w/w resulted in complete inhibition of S. aureus and E. faecalis, and decreased growth of S. epidermidis, P. aeruginosa and E. coli (p<0.0001). The DCT results were confirmed by SEM. However, ADT showed no inhibition halo in all test bacteria, indicating the antimicrobial nanoparticles are not diffusing into the agar milieu. Biocompatibility tests revealed macrophage viability, and TNFalpha secretion was not altered by the presence of the nanoparticles in the resin. Incorporation of PEI nanoparticles in a resin composite had a long lasing antimicrobial effect against a wide range of bacteria with no measured effect on biocompatibility.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of essential oil and major constituents of Salvia chloroleuca.
AB  - The aerial parts of Salvia chloroleuca were collected at full flowering stage at  Shahrestanak (Tehran province of Iran). The essential oil was isolated by hydrodistillation and analyzed by combination of capillary GC and GC-MS. Thirty-four components were identified, representing 98.5% of the total oil. beta-Pinene (10.6%), alpha-pinene (9.0%), beta-caryophyllene (9.0%), 1,8-cineole (9.0%) and carvacrol (7.9%) were the main components. The in vitro antimicrobial activity of the essential oil of S. chloroleuca was studied against seven Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae) and three fungi (Candida albicans, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Aspergillus niger); the disc diffusion method and MIC values indicated that the oil exhibited moderate to high antimicrobial activity.
TI  - Streptozocin-induced diabetic mouse model of urinary tract infection.
AB  - Diabetics have a higher incidence of urinary tract infection (UTI), are infected  with a broader range of uropathogens, and more commonly develop serious UTI sequelae than nondiabetics. To better study UTI in the diabetic host, we created and characterized a murine model of diabetic UTI using the pancreatic islet beta-cell toxin streptozocin in C3H/HeN, C3H/HeJ, and C57BL/6 mouse backgrounds. Intraperitoneal injections of streptozocin were used to initiate diabetes in healthy mouse backgrounds, as defined by consecutive blood glucose levels of >250 mg/dl. UTIs caused by uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UTI89), Klebsiella pneumoniae (TOP52 1721), and Enterococcus faecalis (0852) were studied, and diabetic mice were found to be considerably more susceptible to infection. All three uropathogens produced significantly higher bladder and kidney titers than buffer-treated controls. Uropathogens did not have as large an advantage in the Toll-like receptor 4-defective C3H/HeJ diabetic mouse, arguing that the dramatic increase in colonization seen in C3H/HeN diabetic mice may partially be due to diabetic-induced defects in innate immunity. Competition experiments demonstrated that E. coli had a significant advantage over K. pneumoniae in the bladders of healthy mice and less of an advantage in diabetic bladders. In the kidneys, K. pneumoniae outcompeted E. coli in healthy mice but in diabetic mice E. coli outcompeted K. pneumoniae and caused severe pyelonephritis. Diabetic kidneys contained renal tubules laden with communities of E. coli UTI89 bacteria within an extracellular-matrix material. Diabetic mice also had glucosuria, which may enhance bacterial replication in the urinary tract. These data support that this murine diabetic UTI model is consistent with known characteristics of human diabetic UTI and can provide a powerful tool for dissecting this infection in the multifactorial setting of diabetes.
TI  - Mitracarpus frigidus aerial parts exhibited potent antimicrobial, antileishmanial, and antioxidant effects.
AB  - The crude extract and the hexane, CH(2)Cl(2), EtOAc, n-BuOH, and hydromethanolic  fractions of the aerial parts of Mitracarpus frigidus were evaluated against promastigote forms of two species of Leishmania (L. chagasi and L. amazonensis), 11 strains of bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enterica sorovar Tythimurium, Shigella sonnei, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterobacter cloacae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Bacillus cereus) and two yeasts (Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans). The antioxidant activity (DPPH radical scavenging activity and reducing power), cytotoxicity against mammalian cells, and the contents of phenolics and flavonoids were determined. Phytochemical analysis of the major groups of phytoconstituents is also reported. All samples showed antioxidant activity which was positively correlated to the content of phenolic compounds. S. sonnei, B. cereus and C. neoformans were susceptible to all extracts tested, except for the n-BuOH and hydromethanolic fractions, which demonstrated no antimicrobial activity. The lowest MIC was recorded for the CH(2)Cl(2) fraction against C. neoformans (MIC of 10 microg/ml), followed by B. cereus, S. sonnei, and E. cloacae (MIC of 20, 39 and 39 microg/ml, respectively). The CH(2)Cl(2) fraction was the most effective against L. chagasi (IC(50) of 6.7 microg/ml), and the hydromethanolic fraction exhibited the best activity against L. amazonensis (IC(50) of 9 microg/ml). A cytotoxic effect on mammalian cells was observed only for the crude extract and CH(2)Cl(2) fraction at the concentrations of 130 and 31 microg/ml, respectively. These results suggest that M. frigidus has interesting antimicrobial, antileishmanial and antioxidant activities.
TI  - Translational regulation by an intramolecular stem-loop is required for intermolecular RNA regulation of the par addiction module.
AB  - The par stability determinant of Enterococcus faecalis plasmid pAD1 is the only antisense RNA-regulated addiction module identified to date in gram-positive bacteria. par encodes two small, convergently transcribed RNAs, designated RNA I and RNA II, that function as the toxin (Fst)-encoding and antitoxin components, respectively. Previous work showed that structures at the 5' end of RNA I are important in regulating its translation. The work presented here reveals that a stem-loop sequestering the Fst ribosome binding site is required for translational repression but a helix sequestering the 5' end of RNA I is not. Furthermore, disruption of the stem-loop prevented RNA II-mediated repression of Fst translation in vivo. Finally, although Fst-encoding wild-type RNA I is not toxic in Escherichia coli, mutations affecting stem-loop stability resulted in toxicity in this host, presumably due to increased translation.
TI  - Bacteriocin-producing Lactobacillus strains isolated from poto poto, a Congolese  fermented maize product, and genetic fingerprinting of their plantaricin operons.
AB  - Thirty one bacteriocin-producing Lactobacillus isolates were identified among 135 lactobacilli isolated from the Congolese fermented maize product poto poto, during the preparation and from the finished product. Using species-specific PCR and 16S rRNA gene sequencing, 28 and 3 isolates were identified as L. plantarum and L. fermentum, respectively. Cluster analysis of RAPD-PCR fingerprints revealed two main groups (G1 and G2) plus the L. fermentum isolate C4-13. Group G1 contained 23 isolates with a similarity coefficient > 74.5%, and could be divided in two subgroups (G1-1, G1-2) each with several branches, plus the L. plantarum isolate C11. Group G2 contained 8 isolates with a similarity coefficient > 86%, with two main branches. Using PCR amplification with specific primers, several genes of the plantaricin cluster found in L. plantarum C11 were identified in the isolates. The number of genes that were detected varied between the strains. The L. fermentum isolate EC11 also contained the plnDEFG genes. PCR amplification of DNA from isolates with primers directed to the upstream and downstream region of the plantaricin cluster generated an amplicon identical to that obtained with DNA from the control strain L. plantarum WCFS1. Amplification products from the positive strains were used for restriction analysis with HindIII, EcoRI and KpnI in separate reactions. Cluster analysis of restriction profiles revealed high similarities for EcoRI and HindII digest profiles, and an identical profile for all KpnI digests. The L. fermentum EC11 isolate clustered with L. plantarum strains in a group with a high correlation coefficient. The results suggest a low degree of diversity in the plantarincin gene cluster. However, other strains that tested positive for individual plantaricin genes may present great heterogeneity in the plantaricin operons. Because of their broad spectra of inhibition (including Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, Enterobacter aerogenes, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, and Enterococcus faecalis), isolates from the present study could be used to improve the safety and storage stability of poto poto.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial effects of topical local anesthetics.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The antibacterial activities of local anesthetics are recognized. OBJECTIVE: To investigate in vitro the activity of topical local anesthetic ointments at clinical doses. METHODS: The activity of two different local anesthetic ointments including lidocaine 5% and lidocaine/prilocaine 2.5% was tested against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pyogenes and Enterococcus faecalis by the disc-diffusion method. Sterile discs containing topical local anesthetic drugs were prepared taking into account the doses of ointments used in clinical practice. The validity of the methodology was confirmed using topical antibacterial mupirocin. The inhibition zones of the discs were measured. RESULTS: Mupirocin inhibited all the bacteria. Both local anesthetic ointments were found to be most effective on E. coli, whereas they had no effects on P. aeruginosa. Lidocaine 5% revealed antibacterial activity against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, E. coli, S. pyogenes and E. faecalis, but lidocaine/prilocaine 2.5% showed no activity on E. faecalis and inhibited S. pyogenes only at double doses. It was also observed that the antibacterial activity was in a dose-dependent manner. CONCLUSION: In the light of these findings, it might be concluded that topical local anesthetic ointments in routine settings may have a preventive role against some bacteria.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of neuropeptides against a range of micro-organisms from skin, oral, respiratory and gastrointestinal tract sites.
AB  - Many neuropeptides are similar in size, amino acid composition and charge to antimicrobial peptides. This study aimed to determine whether the neuropeptides substance P (SP), neurokinin A (NKA), calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), neuropeptide Y (NPY) and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), displayed antimicrobial activity against Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans. SP, NPY, VIP and CGRP displayed variable degrees of antimicrobial activity against all the pathogens tested with the exception of S. aureus. These antimicrobial activities add a further dimension to the immunomodulatory roles for neuropeptides in the inflammatory and immune responses.
TI  - Combined physico-chemical treatments based on enterocin AS-48 for inactivation of Gram-negative bacteria in soybean sprouts.
AB  - Enterocin AS-48 was tested for decontamination of soybean sprouts against Gram-negative bacteria. Although treatment with bacteriocin alone had no effect on Salmonella enterica, a synergistic antimicrobial effect was detected at pH 9.0 and in combination with moderate heat treatment. Greatest inactivation was achieved for sprouts heated for 5 min at 65 degrees C in an alkaline (pH 9.0) enterocin AS-48 solution of 25 microg/ml. Bactericidal activity against S. enterica increased greatly when enterocin AS-48 was used in washing solutions in combination with several chemical compounds: EDTA, lactic acid, peracetic acid, polyphosphoric acid, sodium hypochlorite, hexadecylpyridinium chloride, propyl-p-hydroxybenzoate, and hydrocinnamic acid. The combined treatment of enterocin AS-48 and polyphosphoric acid was tested against several other Gram-negative bacteria inoculated on sprouts. The bacteria tested showed great differences in sensitivity to polyphosphoric acid, but synergism with enterocin AS-48 was confirmed in all cases. Combinations of enterocin AS-48 (25 microg/ml) and polyphosphoric acid in a concentration range of 0.1 to 2.0% significantly reduced or inhibited growth of the populations of S. enterica, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Shigella spp., Enterobacter aerogenes, Yersinia enterocolitica, Aeromonas hydrophila and Pseudomonas fluorescens in sprout samples stored at 6 degrees C and 15 degrees C. The combined treatment could therefore be applied to reduce the risks of Gram-negative pathogenic as well as spoilage bacteria on sprouts.
TI  - Ceftobiprole: a review of a broad-spectrum and anti-MRSA cephalosporin.
AB  - Ceftobiprole, an investigational cephalosporin, is currently in phase III clinical development. Ceftobiprole is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin with demonstrated in vitro activity against Gram-positive cocci, including meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and meticillin-resistant S. epidermidis, penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Gram-negative bacilli including AmpC-producing Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but excluding extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strains. Like cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, and cefepime, ceftobiprole demonstrates limited activity against anaerobes such as Bacteroides fragilis and non-fragilis Bacteroides spp. In single-step and serial passage in vitro resistance development studies, ceftobiprole demonstrated a low propensity to select for resistant subpopulations. Ceftobiprole, like cefepime, is a weak inducer and a poor substrate for AmpC beta-lactamases.Ceftobiprole medocaril, the prodrug of ceftobiprole, is converted by plasma esterases to ceftobiprole in <30 minutes. Peak serum concentrations of ceftobiprole observed at the end of a single 30-minute infusion were 35.5 mug/mL for a 500-mg dose and 59.6 mug/mL for a 750-mg dose. The volume of distribution of ceftobiprole is 0.26 L/kg ( approximately 18 L), protein binding is 16%, and its serum half-life is approximately 3.5 hours. Ceftobiprole is renally excreted ( approximately 70% in the active form) and systemic clearance correlates with creatinine clearance, meaning that dosage adjustment is required in patients with renal dysfunction. Ceftobiprole has a modest post-antibiotic effect (PAE) of approximately 0.5 hours for MRSA and a longer PAE of approximately 2 hours for penicillin-resistant pneumococci. Ceftobiprole, when administered intravenously at 500 mg once every 8 hours (2-hour infusion), has a >90% probability of achieving f T(>MIC) (free drug concentration exceeds the minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC]) for 40% and 60%, respectively, of the dosing interval for isolates with ceftobiprole MIC < or =4 and < or =2 mg/L, respectively.Currently, only limited clinical trial data are published for ceftobiprole. In a phase III trial, 784 patients with Gram-positive skin infections were randomized to treatment with either ceftobiprole 500 mg or vancomycin 1 g, each administered twice daily for 7-14 days; 93.3% of patients were clinically cured with ceftobiprole compared with 93.5% receiving vancomycin, and the eradication rate for MRSA infections was 91.8% for ceftobiprole compared with 90% for vancomycin. A phase III, randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial compared ceftobiprole 500 mg every 8 hours with vancomycin 1 g every 12 hours plus ceftazidime 1 g every 8 hours in patients with complicated skin and skin structure infections. Of the 828 patients enrolled, 31% had diabetic foot infections, 30% had abscesses, and 22% had wounds. No difference in clinical cure was reported in the clinically evaluable, intent-to-treat and microbiologically evaluable populations with cure rates of 90.5%, 81.9%, and 90.8%, respectively, in the ceftobiprole-treated patients and 90.2%, 80.8%, and 90.5%, respectively, in the vancomycin plus ceftazidime-treated group. Microbiologic eradication of Gram-positive cocci meticillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) [ceftobiprole 91% vs vancomycin plus ceftazidime 92%] and MRSA (ceftobiprole 87% vs vancomycin plus ceftazidime 80%), as well as Gram-negative bacilli, E. coli (ceftobiprole 89% vs vancomycin plus ceftazidime 92%), and P. aeruginosa (ceftobiprole 87% vs vancomycin plus ceftazidime 100%), was not significantly different between groups. Similar cures rates in the microbiologically evaluable population occurred in both groups for Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL)-positive MSSA and PVL-positive MRSA.Currently, ceftobiprole has completed phase III trials for complicated skin and skin structure infections due to MRSA and nosocomial pneumonia due to suspected or proven MRSA; phase III trials are also ongoing in community-acquired pneumonia. Ceftobiprole has so far demonstrated a good safety profile in preliminary studies with similar tolerability to comparators. The broad-spectrum activity of ceftobiprole may allow it to be used as monotherapy in situations where a combination of antibacterials might be required. Further clinical studies are needed to determine the efficacy and safety of ceftobiprole and to define its role in patient care.
TI  - Oral levofloxacin 500 mg once daily in the treatment of chronic bacterial prostatitis.
AB  - The aim of this study was to confirm further the efficacy and safety of levofloxacin in patients with chronic bacterial prostatitis (CBP) in Europe. Men with a history of CBP were enrolled in a prospective, multinational (eight countries), open-label study to receive levofloxacin 500 mg once daily per os (p.o.) for 28 days. Patients were followed for 6 months. A total of 117 patients were treated. Gram-negative bacteria were identified in 57/106 patients (mainly Escherichia coli (n=37)) and Gram-positive bacteria in 60/106 patients (mainly Enterococcus faecalis (n=18) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (n=14)). Among the intention-to-treat population (n=116), the clinical success rate (cured and improved patients) was 92% (95% confidence interval (CI) 84.8-96.5%), 77.4% (95% CI 68.2-84.9%), 66.0% (95% CI 56.2-75.0%) and 61.9% (95% CI 51.9-71.2%) at 5-12 days, 1 month, 3 months and 6 months post treatment. The microbiological eradication rate according to evaluation scheme II was 82/98 (83.7%, 95% CI 74.8-90.4%) at 1 month and the continued eradication rate was 52/57 (91.2%, 95% CI 80.7-97.1%) at 6 months post treatment. Comparison of four classification schemes showed similar results. Thus, the present investigation is suitably comparable in methods and results to previous studies. Levofloxacin was well tolerated. Four patients (3.4%) discontinued therapy due to adverse events and 15 patients (12.8%) experienced at least one adverse event. Levofloxacin 500 mg p.o. once daily for 28 days is clinically and microbiologically effective in the treatment of CBP caused by susceptible pathogens and is well tolerated.
TI  - The culture site of the gallbladder affects recovery of bacteria in symptomatic cholelithiasis.
AB  - AIM: Traditional methods for bile culturing may miss a large number of underlying bacterial infections that could lead to acute or chronic cholecystitis. AIM: to evaluate possible differences regarding the site of material collection and thus to detect the most suitable sample site for gallbladder culture. METHODS: A cohort of 137 patients with symptomatic cholelithiasis was enrolled. After surgical excision of the gallbladder, bile cultures were separately performed from fundus, body and neck. Identification of bacteria as well as computation of mean bacterial concentrations were performed with standard microbiological techniques. Wilcoxon's paired and Chi-square tests were used for comparison between continuous and discrete parameters, respectively. RESULTS: Thirty-one patients (22.6%) demonstrated at least one positive culture sample. Positivity was 31/31 (100.0%) in neck samples, 20/31 (64.5%) in body and 13/31 (41.9%) in fundus samples (P<0.001). The microorganisms identified were Escherichia coli (14 cases) and Enterococcus faecalis (10 cases), followed by Staphylococcus aureus (3 cases), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecium, Enterobacter aerogenes and Enterobacter cloacae (1 case each). Mean bacterial concentrations in positive samples derived from the neck (272.2 +/- 187.5) were higher (P<0.01) when compared to those derived from both the body (38.2 +/- 28.7) and the fundus (12.5 +/- 11.3). Mean bacterial concentrations in positive samples derived from the body were higher (P<0.01) than those derived from the fundus. CONCLUSION: The neck of the gallbladder hosts the biggest bacterial load in comparison with the body and the fundus. This difference might be attributed to the presence of Rokitansky-Aschoff sinuses, which is the main histological characteristic of the region.
TI  - A mixture of Escherichia coli (DSM 17252) and Enterococcus faecalis (DSM 16440) for treatment of the irritable bowel syndrome--a randomized controlled trial with primary care physicians.
AB  - Therapy trials with bacterial compounds in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) have produced conflicting results. This study was performed in 1988 and 1989, and was re-analysed according to current IBS standards. Two hundred ninety-seven patients with lower abdominal symptoms diagnosed as IBS were treated for 8 weeks by the compound ProSymbioflor((R)) (Symbiopharm GmbH, Herborn, Germany), an autolysate of cells and cell fragments of Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli, or placebo in a double-blinded, randomized fashion. Patients were seen weekly by the physician, who assessed the presence of core IBS symptoms. Responders had at least a 50% decrease in global symptom score (GSS) and in abdominal pain score (APS) reports at >/=1 visit during treatment. The responder rate in GSS to the drug was 102/149 (68.5%) in comparison to placebo with 56/148 (37.8%) (P < 0.001), the improvement in APS was 108/149 (72.5%) and 66/148 (44.6%) respectively (P = 0.001). The number-needed-to-treat was 3.27 for GSS and 3.59 for the APS report. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed a mean response time of 4-5 weeks for active treatment and more than 8 weeks for placebo (P < 0.0001). Treatment of IBS with the bacterial lysate ProSymbioflor is effective and superior to placebo in reducing typical symptoms of IBS patients seen by general practitioners.
TI  - Asymptomatic bacteriuria in patients with diabetes mellitus in Ile-Ife, South-West, Nigeria.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the prevalence and associates of asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) in a sample of Nigerian diabetic patients. DESIGN: Cross-sectional descriptive and analytic study. SETTING: The Wesley Guild Hospital and Ife State Hospital, both units of Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospitals Complex, Ile-Ife, Nigeria. SUBJECTS: One hundred and thirty five diabetic patients and 57 non-diabetic patients as controls. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Demographic parameters of participants were recorded. Significant bacteriuria was determined for each of the mid-stream urine specimen obtained from all the subjects. Organisms isolated were identified and evaluated for antibiotic susceptibility patterns. RESULTS: There was a significant difference in the prevalence of ASB in the two groups. Prevalence of ASB was 16% and 3.5% in the diabetic patients and control respectively (p=0.03). Demographic parameters except age were not related to the presence of ASB. ASB was found in 54.4% of diabetic patients with poor glycaemia control compared with 2.9% in diabetics with good glycaemia control (p = 0.006). Organisms associated with ASB were Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella sp, Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis, however the most predominant was Staphylococcus aureus. These organisms were largely resistant to the common antibiotics tested such as cotrimoxazole and gentamicin but susceptible to nitrofurantoin. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of ASB is high in diabetic patients and poor glucose control can be considered a predisposing factor.
TI  - Attachment of ampicillin to expanded poly(tetrafluoroethylene): surface reactions leading to inhibition of microbial growth.
AB  - The broad spectrum antibiotic, ampicillin (AM), was reacted to expanded poly (tetrafluoroethylene) (ePTFE) surfaces and resulted in the formation of antimicrobial surfaces effective against gram-positive, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus thuringiensis, and Enterococcus faecalis, and gram-negative, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas putida, and Salmonella enterica bacteria. These ePTFE surface modifications were accomplished by utilization of microwave maleic anhydride (MA) plasma reactions leading to the formation of acid groups, followed by amidation reactions of heterofunctional NH 2/COOH-terminated polyethylene glycol (PEG). The final step, the attachment of AM to the PEG spacer, was achieved by amidation reactions between COOH-terminated PEG and NH 2 groups of AM. This approach protects the COOH-AM functionality and diminishes the possibility of hydrolysis of the antimicrobial active portion of AM. These studies also show that approximately 90% of AM molecules are still covalently attached to PEG-MA-ePTFE surfaces after exposure to the bacteria solutions. Even after a 24 h period, the AM volume concentration changes only from 2.25 to 2.04 microg/m3, and depending upon the bacteria type, the bacteria suspensions containing AM-PEG-MA-ePTFE specimens retain 85-99% of their initial optical density.
TI  - Monitoring of antimicrobial resistance in healthy dogs: first report of canine ampicillin-resistant Enterococcus faecium clonal complex 17.
AB  - National surveillance programs on antimicrobial usage and antimicrobial resistance in animals have been established in various countries but few of them include bacteria from pets. The objectives of this study were to assess the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in healthy dogs and to search for resistance phenotypes of clinical relevance. Escherichia coli and Enterococcus spp. were isolated from faecal swabs obtained from 127 dogs. Disk diffusion was used to measure antimicrobial susceptibility in 117 Escherichia coli, 10 Enterococcus faecium and 51 Enterococcus faecalis of canine origin. Resistance was relatively low compared with food animal species in Denmark. All Escherichia coli isolates were susceptible to broad-spectrum aminopenicillins, third generation cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones. Despite the low prevalence of resistance, statistical analysis of questionnaire data revealed a significant association (p=0.02) between recent antimicrobial treatment and resistance in Escherichia coli. Interestingly, two dogs were found to shed Enterococcus faecium resistant to ampicillin. Multilocus sequence typing of these isolates indicated that the two isolates belonged to sequence types associated with human nosocomial infections, and one (ST-192) was genetically related to human epidemic clonal complex 17. The detection of ampicillin-resistant Enterococcus faecium warrants further studies on the prevalence of these bacteria in dogs and on the possible implications to both animal and human health. The results suggest that distinct methods for detection and assessment of antimicrobial resistance in animals should be considered depending on the target animal species and the purposes of the study.
TI  - The Lactococcus lactis FabF fatty acid synthetic enzyme can functionally replace  both the FabB and FabF proteins of Escherichia coli and the FabH protein of Lactococcus lactis.
AB  - The genome of Lactococcus lactis encodes a single long chain 3-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthase. This is in contrast to its close relative, Enterococcus faecalis, and to Escherichia coli, both of which have two such enzymes. In E. faecalis and E. coli, one of the two long chain synthases (FabO and FabB, respectively) has a role in unsaturated fatty acid synthesis that cannot be satisfied by FabF, the other long chain synthase. Since L. lactis has only a single long chain 3-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthase (annotated as FabF), it seemed likely that this enzyme must function both in unsaturated fatty acid synthesis and in elongation of short chain acyl carrier protein substrates to the C18 fatty acids found in the cellular phospholipids. We report that this is the case. Expression of L. lactis FabF can functionally replace both FabB and FabF in E. coli, although it does not restore thermal regulation of phospholipid fatty acid composition to E. coli fabF mutant strains. The lack of thermal regulation was predictable because wild-type L. lactis was found not to show any significant change in fatty acid composition with growth temperature. We also report that overproduction of L. lactis FabF allows growth of an L. lactis mutant strain that lacks the FabH short chain 3-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthase. The strain tested was a derivative (called the fabH bypass strain) of the original fabH deletion strain that had acquired the ability to grow when supplemented with octanoate. Upon introduction of a FabF overexpression plasmid into this strain, growth proceeded normally in the absence of fatty acid supplementation. Moreover, this strain had a normal rate of fatty acid synthesis and a normal fatty acid composition. Both the fabH bypass strain that overproduced FabF and the wild type strain incorporated much less exogenous octanoate into long chain phospholipid fatty acids than did the fabH bypass strain. Incorporation of octanoate and decanoate labeled with deuterium showed that these acids were incorporated intact as the distal methyl and methylene groups of the long chain fatty acids.
TI  - Emergence of macrolide resistance gene mph(B) in Streptococcus uberis and cooperative effects with rdmC-like gene.
AB  - Streptococcus uberis UCN60 was resistant to spiramycin (MIC = 8 microg/ml) but susceptible to erythromycin (MIC = 0.06 microg/ml), azithromycin (MIC = 0.12 microg/ml), josamycin (MIC = 0.25 microg/ml), and tylosin (MIC = 0.5 microg/ml). A 2.5-kb HindIII fragment was cloned from S. uberis UCN60 DNA on plasmid pUC18 and introduced into Escherichia coli AG100A, where it conferred resistance to spiramycin by inactivation. The sequence analysis of the fragment showed the presence of an rdmC-like gene that putatively encoded a protein belonging to the alpha/beta hydrolase family and of the first 196 nucleotides of the mph(B) gene putatively encoding a phosphotransferase known to inactivate 14-, 15-, and 16-membered macrolides in E. coli. The entire mph(B) gene was then identified in S. uberis UCN60. The two genes were expressed alone or in combination in E. coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis. Analysis of MICs revealed that rdmC-like alone did not confer resistance to erythromycin, tylosin, and josamycin in those three hosts. It conferred resistance to spiramycin in E. coli and E. faecalis but not in S. aureus. mph(B) conferred resistance in E. coli to erythromycin, tylosin, josamycin, and spiramycin but only low levels of resistance in E. faecalis and S. aureus to spiramycin (MIC = 8 microg/ml). The combination of mph(B) and rdmC-like genes resulted in a resistance to spiramycin and tylosin in the three hosts that significantly exceeded the mere addition of the resistance levels conferred by each resistance mechanism alone.
TI  - [Influence of the mixed inoculum on the species-identification and antimicrobial  susceptibility test results by the automated microbial systems].
AB  - The influence of the mixed inoculum on the species-identification and antimicrobial susceptibility test results was evaluated for the three automated microbial systems, WalkAway-40 (Dade MicroScan, West Sacramento, CA, USA), VITEK 2 Compact (bioMerieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France) and RAISUS (Nissui Pharmaceutical, Tokyo). In the evaluation, two different species or two different strains were mixed in serial ratios and adjusted to the inoculum cell suspension for the respective systems, and then tested for the species-identification and antimicrobial susceptibility. For the species-identification, all the three automated systems experienced incorrect identifications others from the species inoculated with higher likelihoods (> 90%), e.g. Enterobacter cloacae plus Klebsiella pneumoniae resulted in K. ornithinolytica or E. aerogenes with 93% to 97% likelihoods at the mixing ratio 9 to 1. Whereas, the mixings extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing and non-producing Escherichia coli, methicillin-resistant (MRSA) and methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, and vancomycin-resistant (VR) and vancomycin-susceptible (VS) Enterococcus faecalis, always resulted in correct detection of a small portion of resistant cells. However, minimum ratios of resistant cells for the correct detection varied by the systems, that is, RAISUS required 70% of MRSA, VITEK 2 Compact was 8%, and the WalkAway-40 was 1%. Also, when the cell suspension of VS E. faecalis spiked with Proteus mirabilis was tested, the WalkAway-40 reported as being very rare biotype, but both VITEK 2 Compact and RAISUS reported as the test inoculum being VR E. faecalis. With these results, it can be concluded that: First, incorrect species-identifications others from the inoculated species easily occur when the inoculum contains different species even at the ratio visibly indiscernible on the primary isolation agar plate. Secondly, the automated microbial systems always intend to detect antimicrobial resistant cells in the inoculum rather than to detect major susceptible cells to prevent us from reporting very major error interpretation.
TI  - Surveillance study in Europe and Brazil on clinical aspects and Antimicrobial Resistance Epidemiology in Females with Cystitis (ARESC): implications for empiric therapy.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Uncomplicated cystitis in females is among the most frequent infections in community. OBJECTIVE: To determine clinical aspects, epidemiology, and antimicrobial susceptibility of uropathogens. INTERVENTION: Patients were investigated clinically and with urinalysis and urine culture. MEASUREMENTS: This survey started in 2003 and ended in 2006 including 68 centres in nine European countries and in Brazil. Female patients between 18 and 65 yr with symptoms of uncomplicated cystitis were consecutively enrolled and clinically evaluated. Uropathogens were identified and their susceptibility tested for nine antimicrobials. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Clinical data of 4264 eligible patients were analysed. A positive urine culture was found in 74.6%. Within the 3018 pathogens, Escherichia coli (E. coli) was most frequent (76.7%), followed by Enterococcus faecalis (4.0%), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (3.6%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (3.5%), and Proteus mirabilis (3.5%). E. coli showed the highest rate of susceptibility to fosfomycin (98.1%) followed by mecillinam (95.8%), nitrofurantoin (95.2%), and ciprofloxacin (91.8%). The lowest rate was found for ampicillin (45.1%). For the total spectrum the order was fosfomycin (96.4%), mecillinam (95.9%), ciprofloxacin (90.3%), and nitrofurantoin (87.0%). In all countries a susceptibility rate to E. coli above 90% was found only for fosfomycin, mecillinam, and nitrofurantoin. The susceptibility rates varied significantly from country to country (p<0.0001), except for fosfomycin, mecillinam, and nitrofurantoin. CONCLUSIONS: Despite wide cross-country variability of bacterial susceptibility/resistance rates to the other antimicrobials tested, fosfomycin, mecillinam, and nitrofurantoin have preserved their in vitro activity in all countries investigated. They may represent good options for the empiric therapy of female patients with uncomplicated cystitis.
TI  - A study of chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of Bulgarian propolis.
AB  - Propolis is a natural product which exhibits pronounced antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory effects. AIM: To analyze the chemical composition and antimicrobial effect of Bulgarian propolis, p-cumaric acid and ferulic acid on certain Gram-positive and Gram-negative microorganisms. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Ethanol extract of Bulgarian propolis (Propolin) and water extract of Bulgarian propolis (Propolstom), ferulic acid and p-cumaric acid were used. The chemical HPLC-analysis of propolis was performed with Varian Prostar system. Microbiological tests were done on isolates of Streptococcus beta-haemolyticus, Enterococcus faecalis, Candida albicans and Escherichia coli. Non-treated and ethanol-treated cultures of the corresponding strains were used as controls. Minimal bactericidal and bacteriostatic concentration of Propolin were determined by agar method. RESULTS: The concentration of p-cumaric acid and ferulic acid in ethanol extract of propolis is about 1%. The minimal bactericidal concentration of Bulgarian propolis against Streptococcus beta-haemolyticus is 281 +/- 89.3 microg/ml, against Enterococcus faecalis--3490 +/- 633.1 microg/ml, against Candida albicans--1375 +/- 255.2 microg/ml, and against Escherichia coli--24306 +/- 1706.4 microg/ml. The minimal bactericidal concentration of p-cumaric acid and ferulic acid against Streptococcus beta-haemolyticus is 212 +/- 6.5 microg/ml and 208 +/- 7.7 microg/ml, against Enterococcus faecalis--3013 +/- 176.6 and 3032 +/- 203.4 microg/ml, against Candida albicans--157 +/- 15.5 microg/ml and 149 +/- 23.2 microg/ml, and against Escherichia coli--798 +/- 7.7 microg/ml and 801 +/- 22.8 microg/ml, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The phenolic compounds p-cumaric acid and ferulic acid are 10 times less extracted in water extraction than in ethanol extraction. The most susceptible strains to the Bulgarian propolis and phenolic compounds are Streptococcus beta-haemolyticus and Candida albicans and the least affected are Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis.
TI  - Method for evaluation of the efficacy of antimicrobial preservatives in cosmetic  wet wipes.
AB  - Many cosmetic formulations are now available in the form of wet wipes packaged in sealed sachets or packets. Like the majority of cosmetic products having an aqueous phase, wipes are susceptible to microbial contamination and require the addition of preservatives. The efficacy of such preservatives can be evaluated using a standard challenge test performed on the wetting liquid but this test cannot be regarded as representative for this new type of formulation. The method presented here evaluates the efficacy of preservatives used in wet wipes kept in their original packaging. Dried inoculums were prepared by membrane filtration followed by drying in an incubator. The method is applicable to bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis), Bacillus cereus spores and fungi (Candida albicans and Aspergillus niger). These inoculated carriers were inserted between two wipes in the original package, which was then re-sealed immediately. The test requires one dry inoculum per packet and one packet for each control or test. After incubation at 22.5 degrees C for 1, 2, 7, 14 or 28 days and, for the control, immediately after insertion of the membrane (time 0), microorganism counts were performed on the germ-carrier membranes as well as on adjacent wipes, after transfer into a suitable neutralizing agent. The membranes were shaken in the presence of glass beads and microorganisms were dissociated from the wipes by means of a Stomacher. The supernatants recovered after being left to stand for 20 min are counted by pour plate method or membrane filtration. The feasibility of the method was demonstrated for each of the seven above-mentioned strains. The repeatability and reproducibility of the results obtained is similar to that obtained for preservative efficacy tests in the Pharmacopoeias. The lethal rate of microorganisms during the preparation of dry inoculums ranges from 50 to 90% depending on the strain and the test (generally, a spontaneous reduction of about 1 log up to a maximum of 2 log). The recovery rate for microorganisms from dry inoculums (on membranes) at time 0 (control = T(0)) is around 90%, regardless of the strain or the test. The number of microorganisms recovered from the wipes (W(0)) is between 2 and 10% of the number recovered from membranes (T(0)) and may be considered negligible. Application of this method to different types of wipes demonstrates that the efficacy of preservatives, expressed as the logarithmic reduction in the number of microorganisms at each time point, depends on the type of wipe and on the strain tested. The results obtained are considerably different from those found with the standard challenge tests applied to wetting liquids for wipes. The differences found confirm the need for a specific method applicable to wipes.
TI  - Detection of Blastocystis from stool samples using real-time PCR.
AB  - We developed a real-time LC PCR assay to detect a 152 bp sequence in an uncharacterized region of the Blastocystis genome. The described assay detected 11 of 11 ATCC strains of Blastocystis from subtypes 1, 3, and 4. Three of three stool samples from Oregon and California military personnel that were negative for Blastocystis by an ova and parasite test as well as a conventional PCR assay were positive for Blastocystis using our real-time LC PCR assay. Diagnosis of Blastocystis infections using this sensitive method, including DNA extraction and real-time PCR, only requires 3 h. The lower limit of detection for Blastocystis in stool using the real-time LC PCR assay was calculated to be 760 cells of Blastocystis per 100 mg of stool, an estimated 760 parasites per reaction. The assay did not cross-react with Ruminococcus hansenii, Anarococcus hydrogenalis, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Fusobacterium prausnitzii, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, or Lactobacillus acidophilus. Because of the ease of use, sensitivity, specificity, and increase in Blastocystis infections in the USA we believe this assay has the potential to be useful as a clinical diagnosis tool of Blastocystis infection.
TI  - First prize: Novel uropathogen-resistant coatings inspired by marine mussels.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Success in the prevention of urinary device infections has been elusive, largely due to multiple bacterial attachment strategies and the development of urinary conditioning films. We investigated a novel anti-fouling coating consisting of mussel adhesive protein mimics conjugated to polyethylene glycol (mPEG-DOPA(3)) for its potential to resist conditioning film formation and uropathogen attachment in human urine. METHODS: Model TiO(2) -coated silicon disks ( approximately 75 mm(2)) were either coated with mPEG-DOPA(3) or left uncoated and sterilized using ethylene oxide gas. For bacterial attachment experiments, coated and uncoated surfaces were separately challenged with bacterial strains comprising six major uropathogenic species for 24 hours at 37 degrees C in human pooled urine. Starting inoculum for each strain was 10(5) CFU/mL and 0.5 mL was used per disk. Following incubation, the disks were thoroughly rinsed in phosphate buffered saline to remove non-adherent and weakly-adherent organisms and cell scrapers were employed to dislodge those that were firmly attached. Adherent bacteria were quantitated using dilution plating. Representative disks were also examined using scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive x-ray analysis, and live/dead viability staining. RESULTS: The mPEG-DOPA(3) coating significantly resisted the attachment of all uropathogens tested, with a maximum >231-fold reduction in adherence for Escherichia coli GR-12, Enterococcus faecalis 23241, and Proteus mirabilis 296 compared to uncoated TiO(2) disks. Scanning electron microscopy and viability staining analyses also reflected these results and demonstrated the ability of the coating to resist urinary constituent adherence as well. CONCLUSION: Model surfaces coated with mPEG-DOPA(3) strongly resisted both urinary film formation and bacterial attachment in vitro. Future in vitro and in vivo studies will be conducted to assess whether similar findings can be demonstrated when these polymer coatings are applied to urologic devices.
TI  - Developmental intestinal aerobic microflora in the kori bustard (Ardeotis kori).
AB  - A study was carried out to investigate the normal aerobic bacterial flora of developing kori bustard (Ardeotis kori) chicks, captive bred at the National Avian Research Center, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. Faecal samples were collected from 14 birds at different ages from the first day of hatching until 99 days old and were cultured for aerobic bacteria. Several bacterial species were isolated from the cultures, they included Escherichia coli, Streptococcus viridians, Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus spp., Enterobacter, spp. and Serratia marcescens. Gram-negative bacilli were isolated from all but one of the faecal samples collected. They were also the predominant bacteria, accounting for between 55.6 and 73.4% of the mean colony count of faecal cultures from all age groups. E. coli was the most frequently isolated bacteria, the frequency and mean colony count increased as the birds grew older. Gram-positive cocci were isolated from between 50 and 100% of the faecal samples from all age groups, and they accounted for between 26.6 and 44.4% of the mean colony count. Results from this study indicated that Gram-negative bacilli and Gram-positive cocci can be isolated frequently from the faeces of developing, clinically normal, captive bred kori bustard chicks.
TI  - A functional gene array for detection of bacterial virulence elements.
AB  - Emerging known and unknown pathogens create profound threats to public health. Platforms for rapid detection and characterization of microbial agents are critically needed to prevent and respond to disease outbreaks. Available detection technologies cannot provide broad functional information about known or novel organisms. As a step toward developing such a system, we have produced and tested a series of high-density functional gene arrays to detect elements of virulence and antibiotic resistance mechanisms. Our first generation array targets genes from Escherichia coli strains K12 and CFT073, Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus. We determined optimal probe design parameters for gene family detection and discrimination. When tested with organisms at varying phylogenetic distances from the four target strains, the array detected orthologs for the majority of targeted gene families present in bacteria belonging to the same taxonomic family. In combination with whole-genome amplification, the array detects femtogram concentrations of purified DNA, either spiked in to an aerosol sample background, or in combinations from one or more of the four target organisms. This is the first report of a high density NimbleGen microarray system targeting microbial antibiotic resistance and virulence mechanisms. By targeting virulence gene families as well as genes unique to specific biothreat agents, these arrays will provide important data about the pathogenic potential and drug resistance profiles of unknown organisms in environmental samples.
TI  - Cloning, E. coli overexpression, purification and binding properties of TraA and  TraC, two proteins involved in the pheromone-dependent conjugation process in enterococci.
AB  - The bacteriocin encoding plasmid pPD1 from Enterococcus faecalis is involved in a mating response to the sex pheromone cPD1 produced by recipient bacterial cells devoid of pPD1. Previous studies showed that cPD1 is internalized into donor cells in a process in which TraC plays the role of cell surface pheromone receptor. Inside the recipient cells, the pheromone binds to the plasmid-encoded cytoplasmic protein TraA, able to recognize specific DNA sequences and to modulate the conjugation process. To avoid self-induction of the conjugation process, donor cells produce the inhibitor iPD1, which competes with cPD1. This study was designed to produce recombinant TraA and TraC in a functionally active state and to evaluate their main functional properties. We have isolated the sequences encoding TraA and TraC from the plasmid pPD1 and cloned them in suitable expression vectors. The two recombinant proteins were successfully obtained in a soluble form using Escherichia coli as expression host and a T7 inducible expression system. TraC and TraA were purified to homogeneity by three or two chromatographic steps, respectively, leading to a final yield up to 4mg/l of cell culture for TraC and up to 10mg/l of cell culture for TraA. The ability of TraA and TraC to bind the specific pheromone and inhibitor peptides has been assessed by means of ESI-mass spectrometry. Moreover, the ability of recombinant TraA to bind DNA has been demonstrated by means of electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Overall these results are consistent with the heterologously expressed TraC and TraA being functionally active.
TI  - Heterologous expression of functionally active enterolysin A, class III bacteriocin from Enterococcus faecalis, in Escherichia coli.
AB  - The heterologous expression of enterolysin A (EnlA), heat-labile class III bacteriocin from Enterococcus faecalis II/1 with anti-listerial activity, was studied in Escherichia coli. The PCR amplified products of enterolysin A structural gene, N-terminal part of EnlA with endopeptidase-like activity and C-terminal part of EnlA similar to a lysis gene of bacteriophage, were cloned in prelinearized pQE-30UA expression vector. The expression of EnlA structural gene led to the synthesis and secretion of functional-active His-tagged enterolysin A protein, which was purified to homogeneity using His-Select Cartridge and was shown to be fully active against the indicator strain. The expression of N-terminal or C-terminal part of EnlA and deletion of last 58 amino acids from C-terminal domain of EnlA led to the synthesis of biologically non-active proteins.
TI  - Lateral gene transfer in phylogeny of azoreductase enzyme.
AB  - This paper attempts to reconstruct the phylogeny of azoreductase enzyme from different organisms and compare it with the small subunit rRNA-based phylogeny of the organisms. The two phylogenies were found to be incongruent, indicating several events of lateral transfer of azoreductase gene between phylogenetically diverse organisms. However, the phylogenetic analysis methods have several limitations and a single method may not give the true pattern. Hence, it is necessary to corroborate the results with other complementary analysis tools. We used several tools to test our hypothesis of lateral transfer and found that it was supported not only by the analysis of the whole sequences, but also by the conserved motifs detected in these sequences. There were ample evidences for lateral transfer of azoreductase gene among enteric bacteria. There were also indications that azoreductase probably evolved in prokaryotes and then it was laterally transferred to eukaryotes in multiple events, resulting in some sequence variation among eukaryotic azoreductases. Finally, profile HMMs and conserved motifs extracted from these azoreductase sequences were found to provide sensitive tools for identifying potential azoreductases from the database. The analysis techniques used in this study can be extended to other gene trees to verify their evolutionary histories.
TI  - Healthcare-associated infections in Finnish acute care hospitals: a national prevalence survey, 2005.
AB  - The objectives of the first national prevalence survey on healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) in Finland were to assess the extent of HAI, distribution of HAI types, causative organisms, prevalence of predisposing factors and use of antimicrobial agents. The voluntary survey was performed during February-March 2005 in 30 hospitals, including tertiary and secondary care hospitals and 10 (25%) other acute care hospitals in the country. The overall prevalence of HAI was 8.5% (703/8234). Surgical site infection was the most common HAI (29%), followed by urinary tract infection (19%) and primary bloodstream infection or clinical sepsis (17%). HAI prevalence was higher in males, among intensive care and surgical patients, and increased with age and severity of underlying illness. The most common causative organisms, identified in 56% (398/703) of patients with HAIs, were Escherichia coli (13%), Staphylococcus aureus (10%) and Enterococcus faecalis (9%). HAIs caused by multi-resistant microbes were rare (N = 6). A total of 122 patients were treated in contact isolation due to the carriage of multi-resistant microbes. At the time of the survey, 19% of patients had a urinary catheter, 6% central venous line and 1% were ventilated. Antimicrobial treatment was given to 39% of patients. These results can be used for prioritising infection control measures and planning more detailed incidence surveillance of HAI. The survey was a useful tool to increase the awareness of HAI in participating hospitals and to train infection control staff in diagnosing HAIs.
TI  - The in-vitro antimicrobial activity of Abrus precatorius (L) fabaceae extract on  some clinical pathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the in-vitro antimicrobial activities of the extracts  of Abrus precatorius on some clinical isolates as resistance to available and affordable antibiotics by these pathogens is on the increase. METHOD: In this study the antimicrobial effects of the extracts of Abrus precatorius from leaves, stem and the seed oil were tested against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, three clinical S. aureus isolates from different sources, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus anginosus (S.milleri), Bacillus subtilis, Corynebacterium spp (toxigenic strain of the mitis biotype), Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa as well as Candida albicans using the agar well diffusion technique. Aqueous and methanolic extraction, using the soxhlet extractor was carried out on all plant parts used while petroleum ether was the solvent used to extract the seed oil. To measure the MIC values, various concentrations of the stock, 512, 256, 128, 64, 32, 16, 8 and 4 microg/ml were assayed against the test bacteria. RESULT: At the different concentrations of the extracts used (512 microg/ml - 4 microg/ml), Staphylococcus aureus was the most sensitive organism with an MIC of 8 ug/ml for the leaf extract. Extract from the stem and seed oil were potent against some of the gram-positive bacteria and Candida albicans but not against S anginosus, E. faecalis and gram-negative bacteria tested. The pH of the extracts ranged between pH5 and pH8. This study demonstrates that Abrus precatorius particularly the seed oil has a potent antimicrobial activity. CONCLUSION: The results substantiate the ethno botanical use of different parts of Abrus precatorius for the treatment of various bacteria-related diseases. Topical application of Abrus precatorius extracts in ointments may be recommended especially for treating superficial infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Interactions of some common pathogenic bacteria with Acanthamoeba polyphaga.
AB  - Protozoan grazing is a major trophic pathway whereby the biomass re-enters the food web. Nonetheless, not all bacteria are digested by protozoa and the number known to evade digestion, resulting in their environmental augmentation, is increasing. We investigated the interactions of Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC), Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), with the amoeba, Acanthamoeba polyphaga. There was evidence of predation of all bacterial species except L. monocytogenes and S. aureus, where extracellular numbers were significantly higher when cultured with amoebae compared with growth in the absence of amoebae. Intracellular growth kinetic experiments and fluorescent confocal microscopy suggest that S. aureus survived and may even multiply within A. polyphaga, whereas there was no apparent intra-amoebal replication of L. monocytogenes and higher numbers were likely sustained on metabolic waste products released during coculture.
TI  - A new family of D-2-hydroxyacid dehydrogenases that comprises D-mandelate dehydrogenases and 2-ketopantoate reductases.
AB  - The gene for the D-mandelate dehydrogenase (D-ManDH) of Enterococcus faecalis IAM10071 was isolated by means of an activity staining procedure and PCR and expressed in Escherichia coli cells. The recombinant enzyme exhibited high catalytic activity toward various 2-ketoacid substrates with bulky hydrophobic side chains, particularly C3-branched substrates such as benzoylformate and 2-ketoisovalerate, and strict coenzyme specificity for NADH and NAD(+). It showed marked sequence similarity with known NADP-dependent 2-ketopantoate reductases (KPR). These results indicate that together with KPR, D-ManDH constitutes a new family of D-2-hydroxyacid dehydrogenases that act on C3-branched 2-ketoacid substrates with various specificities for coenzymes and substrates.
TI  - The establishment of resistance phenotypes for bacteria isolated from outpatients in urine cultures.
AB  - From 1911 outpatients, who addressed a Timisoara private clinical laboratory, from January to December 2005, we collected 1,889 urine cultures, 431 being positive. Bacteria identification was generally done using morphological, cultural, biochemical characters and pathogenicity tests. Sensitivity testing to antimicrobial medical drugs was done by using the classical diffusion Kirby-Bauer method and the automatic analyzer Osiris, also. The main bacteria involved in the etiology of these infections were represented by Enterobacteriaceae, head of the list being Escherichia coli (81.21%), followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (8.35%) and Proteus mirabilis (3.02%). We also isolated Gram positive cocci (in a much smaller proportion), mainly represented by Enterococcus faecalis (1.16%), Staphylococcus aureus (0.93%), Streptococcus agalactiae, and also Gram negative non-fermentative bacilli, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa (0.93%) or Acinetobacter baumanii (0.23%). As soon as we performed the sensitivity tests, we divided them in resistance phenotypes: Most of the Enterobacteriaceae were integrated in the wild phenotype, followed by the penicillinase producing phenotype. An E. coli strain (0.29%) and 3 Klebsiella pneumoniae strains (8.33%) were integrated in the large spectrum, multidrug resistant, beta-lactamase producing phenotype, also associated with resistance to fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides; Non-fermentative bacilli did not present special resistance problems, the four Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were integrated in the wild phenotype (secreting induced chromosomal cephalosporinase). As for Staphylococcus aureus it was identified a strain having fluoroquinolone resistance, two strains secreting penicillinase and having a K (Nm) phenotype and a strain secreting penicillinase only. Antibiotic resistance represents a major concern for patients, physicians, healthcare managers, and policymakers. The use of antibiotics is closely linked with the development of acquired antibiotic resistance.
TI  - Identification of the coiled-coil domains of Enterococcus faecalis DivIVA that mediate oligomerization and their importance for biological function.
AB  - Bacillus subtilis (Bs) DivIVA comprises coiled-coil structures and self-associates forming a 10-12 mer complex in vitro. Using bioinformatic approaches, we determined that Enterococcus faecalis (Ef) DivIVA comprises four coiled-coil domains, one at the N-terminus, the second and the third in the central region of the protein and the fourth at the C-terminus. We determined that DivIVA(Ef) self-interacts and forms a 10-12 multimeric complex. Point mutations or deletions of the central regions predicted bioinformatically to disrupt the coiled-coil structures either eliminated or weakened DivIVA(Ef) self-interaction and reduced oligomerization. Mutations disrupting the N- and C-terminal coiled-coils of DivIVA(Ef) did not affect DivIVA(Ef) oligomerization. The introduction of DivIVA(Ef) mutations to both the N-terminal and the central coiled-coil domains were lethal unless rescued by expressing wild-type DivIVA(Ef) in trans. E. faecalis cells expressing these mutations displayed aberrant cell morphology, indicating disruption of the normal cell division phenotype. The results in E. faecalis also indicate that both the N-terminal and the central coiled-coil structures of DivIVA(Ef) are indispensable for proper biological function. Overexpression of wild-type DivIVA(Ef) in both rod-shaped and round Escherichia coli cells resulted in morphological changes, while the overexpression of DivIVA(Ef) mutations failed to induce such alterations.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of sodium hypochlorite and chlorhexidine by two different  tests.
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial capacity of sodium hypochlorite (1% and 5%) and chlorhexidine (0.12%, 0.5% and 1%) with or without the addition of organic material (bovine serum albumin, BSA) against some bacterial samples (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum) using two activity tests (contact and diffusion agar tests). In the contact test (first model), bacterial samples were kept in contact with each irrigating solution for different time intervals: immediately (t(0)), 5 min (t(5)), 15 min (t(15)) and 30 min (t(30)). The agar diffusion test was the second model used. In half the specimens, 0.5% BSA was added to simulate organic tissue present in the root canal. Bacterial growth was evaluated for each microorganism and activity test. Each test was repeated 10 times. In the contact test, 0.12% chlorhexidine solution (CHX) did not eliminate E. faecalis at any tested time. CHX at 0.5% eliminated all strains except E. faecalis after immediate contact. All strains were eliminated by 1% CHX, 1% NaOCl and 5% NaOCl. BSA did not interfere with the antimicrobial activity of the irrigating solutions. In the agar diffusion test, all solutions exhibited zones of antimicrobial activity; however, BSA interfered with the antimicrobial activity of NaOCl and CHX. Under the condition of the contact test, the 0.12% CHX was ineffective in eliminating E. faecalis, while 0.5% CHX, 1% CHX, 1% NaOCl and 5% NaOCl showed antibacterial effectiveness against all the tested bacterial strains. The addition of an organic load interfered with the accuracy of the agar diffusion test.
TI  - On the factors influencing the performance of solar reactors for water disinfection with photosensitized singlet oxygen.
AB  - Two solar reactors based on compound parabolic collectors (CPCs) were optimized for water disinfection by photosensitized singlet oxygen (1O2) production in the heterogeneous phase. Sensitizing materials containing Ru(II) complexes immobilized on porous silicone were produced, photochemically characterized, and successfully tested for the inactivation of up to 10(4) CFU mL(-1) of waterborne Escherichia coli (gram-negative) or Enterococcus faecalis (gram-positive) bacteria. The main factors determining the performance of the solar reactors are the type of photosensitizing material, the sensitizer loading, the CPC collector geometry (fin- vs coaxial-type), the fluid rheology, and the balance between concurrent photothermal--photolytic and 1O2 effects on the microorganisms' inactivation. In this way, at the 40 degrees N latitude of Spain, water can be disinfected on a sunny day (0.6-0.8 MJ m(-2) L(-1) accumulated solar radiation dose in the 360-700 nm range, typically 5-6 h of sunlight) with a fin-type reactor containing 0.6 m2 of photosensitizing material saturated with tris(4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline)ruthenium(II) (ca. 2.0 g m(-2)). The optimum rheological conditions require laminar-to-transitional water flow in both prototypes. The fin-type system showed better inactivation efficiency than the coaxial reactor due to a more important photolytic contribution. The durability of the sensitizing materials was tested and the operational lifetime of the photocatalyst is at least three months without any reduction in the bacteria inactivation efficiency. Solar water disinfection with 1O2-generating films is demonstrated to be an effective technique for use in isolated regions of developing countries with high yearly average sunshine.
TI  - Qnr-like pentapeptide repeat proteins in gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To study the role of Qnr-like pentapeptide repeat proteins (PRPs) from several gram-positive species with quinolone resistance in vitro. METHODS: A PCR-based strategy was used to clone and express genes coding for Qnr-like PRPs in Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Listeria monocytogenes, Clostridium perfringens, C. difficile, Bacillus cereus and B. subtilis in Escherichia coli DH10B. MIC values of nalidixic acid and fluoroquinolones were determined for reference strains and E. coli DH10B harbouring recombinant plasmids containing genes coding for PRPs. RESULTS: Amino acid identity of Qnr-like PRPs in gram-positive strains compared with that of the plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance determinants QnrA1, QnrB1 and QnrS1 was in the range of 16% to 22%. Recombinant plasmids coding for Qnr-like PRPs conferred reduced susceptibility to fluoroquinolones (in the range of 0.016 to 0.064 mg/L for ciprofloxacin) and nalidixic acid (from 6 to 12 mg/L), depending on the antimicrobial agent and PRP. The PRP from B. subtilis showed no protective effect. CONCLUSIONS: The PRPs analysed conferred a reduced susceptibility phenotype in E. coli; the data provide further evidence of the possible roles in quinolone resistance of PRPs from different gram-positive species. These gram-positive species may constitute a reservoir for Qnr-like quinolone resistance proteins.
TI  - Antibacterial effects of chitosan powder: mechanisms of action.
AB  - Chitosan, the deacetylated derivative of chitin, is a natural D-glucosamine polymer that can be extracted from the shells of seafood such as prawns crabs and lobsters. It can be used as a flocculent, plant disease resistant promoter, anti-cancer agent, wound healing promotion agent and antimicrobial agent. The aim of this paper is the study of the interaction between chitosan powder and various kinds of pathogen microorganisms potentially present in water. First of all, physico-chemical characterisations of chitin and chitosan powder were performed. The deacetylation yields were 35%, 60% and 80 +/- 10%. The experimental studies focused on the measurements of the mortality constant rate for various bacterial strains, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus saprophyticus. An explanation of the antibacterial mechanisms is proposed involving the cell wall disruption due to free amino groups present in chitosan.
TI  - Hidden pathogens uncovered: metagenomic analysis of urinary tract infections.
AB  - Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are the most common kidney and urologic diseases  in industrial nations and are usually caused through faecal contamination of the urinary tract. In this study, we have examined 1449 urine specimens both by culture and by PCR. The majority of UTIs examined were caused by Escherichia coli (35.15%), followed by miscellaneous bacteria (23.03%), and by Enterococcus faecalis (19.39%). A large fraction of fastidious and anaerobic bacteria (22.43%) was not detected under culture conditions but only by using PCR. This group of bacteria evade the standard culture conditions used in routine diagnostic laboratories examining urine specimens. The molecular approach used broad-range 16S rDNA PCR, denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography analysis, sequencing, and bioinformatic analysis to uncover these 'hidden' pathogens and is recommended in particular when examining leukocyte esterase-positive and culture-negative urinary tract specimens.
TI  - Comparison of pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns of antimicrobial-resistant Escherichia coli and enterococci isolates from the feces of livestock and livestock farmers in Japan.
AB  - Seven hundred thirty-nine animal strains and 662 livestock-farmer strains, consisting of Escherichia coli and enterococci, were examined for their pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and antimicrobial-resistance patterns. Two hundred fifty-eight and 203 PFGE patterns were found among 739 animal strains isolated from animals comprising broilers, pigs and cattle, and 662 human strains isolated from livestock farmers, respectively, from 27 farms in Japan. These results demonstrated that the PFGE patterns found among E. coli and enterococci strains from animals and livestock-farmers were heterogeneous and considerably diverse. The strains having both the identical PFGE pattern and the same drug-resistance pattern were defined as a single clone in this study. Seven types of E. coli and enterococci clones were shared among animals within the same farms and between the different farms housing the same animal species. The 25 strains (3.4%) of 739 E. coli and enterococci animal strains belonged to these seven types of clones. Only three types of E. coli clones were shared among animals between the different farms housing different animal species, but no identical E. faecalis or E. faecium clones were found between different animal species farms. The 15 strains (2.0%) of 739 E. coli and enterococci animal strains belonged to these three types of clones. Additionally, the 11 strains (1.5%) of 739 E. coli and enterococci strains isolated from animals were identical clones to strains isolated from livestock farmers of the same farm. These results suggest that the transmission of animal clones to livestock farmers or vice versa is less common.
TI  - Backbone 1H, 15N, and 13C resonance assignments and secondary-structure of the conserved hypothetical protein HP0892 of Helicobacter pylori.
AB  - HP0892 (SwissProt/TrEMBL ID O25552) is a 90-residue conserved hypothetical protein from Helicobacter pylori strain 26695, with a calculated pI of 9.38 and a molecular mass of 10.41 kDa. It belongs to the Plasmid stabilization system protein family (PF05016) in the Pfam database. Proteins with sequence similarity to HP0892 exist in Vibrio choierae, Enterococcus faecalis, Campylobacter jejuni, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli O157. Here we report the sequence-specific backbone resonance assignments of HP0892 using multidimentional heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy. About 97.0% (422/ 435) of the HN, N, CO, C Alpha , C Beta resonances of 90 residues of HP0892 were assigned. On the basis of the resonance assignments, three helical regions and four strand regions were identified using the CSI program. This study is a prerequisite for calculating the solution structure of HP0892, and will be useful for studying its interaction with other molecules.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of omiganan pentahydrochloride tested against contemporary bacterial pathogens commonly responsible for catheter-associated infections.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Omiganan pentahydrochloride is a cidal cationic peptide with a broad  antimicrobial spectrum, including yeast, currently in development as a topical agent for the prevention of catheter-associated infections. We evaluated the spectrum and potency of omiganan against pathogens commonly associated with such infections. METHODS: A recent (2005-06) collection of bacterial isolates originating from patients with bloodstream, respiratory tract, and skin and skin structure infections in US medical centres was evaluated by reference broth microdilution methods against omiganan and comparator agents. RESULTS: All tested gram-positive (390) and -negative (167) isolates were inhibited by < or = 128 and < or = 1024 mg/L, respectively, of omiganan. The agent was the most active against coagulase-negative staphylococci (range 1-8 mg/L; MIC(50/90), 4 mg/L) and inhibited all Staphylococcus aureus at < or = 32 mg/L (MIC(50/90), 16 mg/L). Omiganan was 16-fold more active against Enterococcus faecium than Enterococcus faecalis (MIC(50/90) results, 4/8 versus 64/128 mg/L, respectively). MIC ranges and MIC(50) potencies were unaffected by methicillin resistance in staphylococci, vancomycin resistance in enterococci, and penicillin resistance in streptococci. Omiganan potency was also unaffected by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) production in Escherichia coli when compared with wild-type strains (MIC(50) values 32 mg/L), although a 4-fold increase was noted among ESBL-positive Klebsiella spp. (128 versus 32 mg/L, respectively). Wild-type Enterobacter spp. displayed higher omiganan MIC(50/90) results (64/512 mg/L) compared with AmpC-hyperproducing strains (32/64 mg/L). Carbapenem-susceptible and -resistant P. aeruginosa strains exhibited omiganan MIC(50/90) values of 128/256 mg/L. CONCLUSIONS: At a 1% (10 000 mg/L) topical gel formulation, omiganan can be expected to inhibit all clinically relevant bacterial species producing catheter-associated infections (all MIC values, < or = 1024 mg/L), including those with antimicrobial-resistant phenotypes.
TI  - Activity of amikacin, ertapenem, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin alone and in combination against resistant nosocomial pathogens by time-kill.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the synergistic activity of amikacin/ertapenem, fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin)/ertapenem and amikacin/fluoroquinolones combinations against resistant nosocomial pathogens. METHODS: Time-kill studies were performed over 24 hours using an inoculum of 5 x 10(6) - 1 x 10(7) cfu/mL. Antibiotics were tested at the 1 x MIC and 4 x MIC concentrations. RESULTS: At MIC and/or 4 x MIC concentrations, the antibiotic combinations showed additive or synergistic activity against Acinetobacter strains and extended spectrum beta-lactamase producing Klebsiella pneumoniae. In Escherichia coli strains, synergy was seen when amikacin was combined with ertapenem, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin; ertapenem in combination with fluoroquinolones demonstrated antagonism. In Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, synergistic effect was exhibited by ertapenem plus amikacin and ertapenem plus fluoroquinolones. The antibiotic combinations showed antagonistic interaction in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis. CONCLUSION: The antibiotic combinations showed additive or synergistic activity against many gram-negative pathogens.
TI  - Antimicrobial triterpenoids from Vladimiria muliensis.
AB  - A new triterpenoid with a rearranged ursane skeleton, 3beta-acetoxyl-11alpha-methoxybauer-8-en-7alpha-ol ( 1), two new ursane triterpenoids, 1alpha,5alpha-dioxy-11alpha-hydroxyurs-12-en-3-one ( 2) and urs-3beta,13alpha,18beta-triol ( 3), together with three known ursane triterpenoids ( 4- 6) were isolated from the rhizome of Vladimiria muliensis. Their structures were elucidated on the basis of spectroscopic methods (IR, EIMS, HRESIMS, 1D and 2D NMR, and X-ray crystallography diffraction). Compounds 2 and 4 exhibited modest antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli, Candida albicans, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus cereus, and Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Clinical significance of nontraditional bacterial uropathogens in the management  of chronic prostatitis.
AB  - PURPOSE: We compared the clinical benefits of eradicating traditional accepted uropathogens and nontraditional uropathogens (gram-positive bacteria other than enterococci) in prostate specific specimens in men with clinical prostatitis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Men with prostatitis-like symptoms and any bacteria localized to prostate specific specimens were treated with levofloxacin or ciprofloxacin for 4 weeks with 6 months of followup. Rates of bacterial eradication and clinical responses in group 1, who had uropathogenic localization (eg Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis), were compared to those in group 2, who had bacteria considered nonuropathogens (eg coagulase negative Staphylococcus species and Streptococcus species). RESULTS: Of the men 261, including 146 in group 1 and 115 in group 2, were available for analyses. Mean age was 51.3 years and mean symptom duration was 8.4 weeks (median 3.5). Of the patients 107 (41%) had received previous antibiotic treatment. Bacteria eradication rates were similar in groups 1 and 2 (74.0% and 78.3%, respectively, p = 0.47). Clinical response rates were also similar in groups 1 and 2 (76.6% and 70.4%, respectively, p = 0.26). In groups 1 and 2 there was a statistically significant correlation between clinical and microbiological outcomes (chi-square analysis correlation p = 0.0014 and 0.0055, respectively). At 6 months of followup 70.5% of successfully treated group 1 patients were still considered to have a positive clinical response compared to 72.8% in group 2 (p = 0.75). CONCLUSIONS: Clinically acceptable short and long-term microbiological and clinical responses to fluoroquinolone therapy for clinical prostatitis did not depend on whether traditional uropathogenic bacteria or nontraditional uropathogens were isolated in prostate specific specimens.
TI  - Effectiveness of ozonated water on Candida albicans, Enterococcus faecalis, and endotoxins in root canals.
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of ozonated water in the  elimination of Candida albicans, Enterococcus faecalis, and endotoxins from root canals. Twenty-four single-rooted human teeth were inoculated with C. albicans and E. faecalis, and 24 specimens were inoculated with Escherichia coli endotoxin. Ozonated water (experimental group) or physiologic solution (control group) was used as irrigant agent. Antimicrobial effectiveness was evaluated by the reduction of microbial counts. Lipopolissacharide complex presence was assessed by limulus amebocyte lysate test and B-lymphocyte stimulation. Data were analyzed by Wilcoxon and Mann-Whitney tests (5%). Ozonated water significantly reduced the number of C. albicans and E. faecalis at the immediate sampling, but increased values were detected after 7 days. Ozonated water did not neutralize endotoxin. It could be concluded that ozonated water was effective against C. albicans and E. faecalis but showed no residual effect. No activity on endotoxin was observed.
TI  - Incisional surgical site infection in kidney transplantation.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Incisional surgical site infections are common bacterial infections in kidney transplantation. The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence, timing, etiology, and risk factors for incisional surgical site infections. METHODS: We performed a prospective study that included a population of 1400 consecutive patients (58.4% males) who underwent kidney transplantation in Spanish hospitals pertaining to the RESITRA research network. RESULTS: A total of 55 patients developed 63 episodes of incisional surgical site infections. Median time from transplant to incisional surgical site infections was 20 days (range, 2 to 76 days). All infected patients recovered from incisional surgical site infections. The most frequently isolated pathogens were Escherichia coli (31.7%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (13.3%), Enterococcus faecalis (11.6%), Enterobacter spp. (10%), and coagulase-negative staphylococci (8.3%). Diabetic patients had an increased risk of incisional surgical site infections (7.5%, P = 0.013). We used several different regimens of antimicrobial prophylaxis. None were found to be associated with an increased risk of incisional surgical site infections. The use of sirolimus was associated with an increased risk of incisional surgical site infections (7.4%, P = 0.018). CONCLUSIONS: Diabetic patients, and those who received sirolimus-based immunosuppressive regimens, showed an increased risk of developing incisional surgical site infections after kidney transplantation.
TI  - High speed classification of individual bacterial cells using a model-based light scatter system and multivariate statistics.
AB  - We describe a model-based instrument design combined with a statistical classification approach for the development and realization of high speed cell classification systems based on light scatter. In our work, angular light scatter from cells of four bacterial species of interest, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Listeria innocua, and Enterococcus faecalis, was modeled using the discrete dipole approximation. We then optimized a scattering detector array design subject to some hardware constraints, configured the instrument, and gathered experimental data from the relevant bacterial cells. Using these models and experiments, it is shown that optimization using a nominal bacteria model (i.e., using a representative size and refractive index) is insufficient for classification of most bacteria in realistic applications. Hence the computational predictions were constituted in the form of scattering-data-vector distributions that accounted for expected variability in the physical properties between individual bacteria within the four species. After the detectors were optimized using the numerical results, they were used to measure scatter from both the known control samples and unknown bacterial cells. A multivariate statistical method based on a support vector machine (SVM) was used to classify the bacteria species based on light scatter signatures. In our final instrument, we realized correct classification of B. subtilis in the presence of E. coli,L. innocua, and E. faecalis using SVM at 99.1%, 99.6%, and 98.5%, respectively, in the optimal detector array configuration. For comparison, the corresponding values for another set of angles were only 69.9%, 71.7%, and 70.2% using SVM, and more importantly, this improved performance is consistent with classification predictions.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of honey from stingless honeybees (Hymenoptera; Apidae; Meliponinae).
AB  - The aim of the study was to examine antibacterial activity of the honey of stingless honeybees (Meliponinae). An agar well diffusion assay demonstrated that many honey samples of stingless honeybees inhibited the growth of test strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa; moreover, they exhibited non-peroxide antibacterial activity against those strains. This is the first time that non-peroxide antimicrobial activity of honey from a number of species of stingless honeybees has been demonstrated. These antibacterial activities appear to be powerful, even when compared to those of"manuka honey" from Apinae honeybees.
TI  - Secreted enteric antimicrobial activity localises to the mucus surface layer.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The intestinal mucosa is constantly exposed to a dense and highly dynamic microbial flora and challenged by a variety of enteropathogenic bacteria. Antibacterial protection is provided in part by Paneth cell-derived antibacterial peptides such as the alpha-defensins. The mechanism of peptide-mediated antibacterial control and its functional importance for gut homeostasis has recently been appreciated in patients with Crohn's ileitis. In the present study, the spatial distribution of antimicrobial peptides was analysed within the small intestinal anatomical compartments such as the intestinal crypts, the overlaying mucus and the luminal content. METHODS: Preparations from the different intestinal locations as well as whole mouse small intestine were extracted and separated by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. Antibacterial activity was determined in extracts, and the presence of antimicrobial peptides/proteins was confirmed by N-terminal sequencing, mass spectrometry analysis and immunodetection. RESULTS: The secreted antibacterial activity was largely confined to the layer of mucus, whereas only minute amounts of activity were noted in the luminal content. The extractable activity originating from either crypt/mucus/lumen compartments respectively (given as a percentage) was for Listeria monocytogenes, 48 (4)/44 (4)/8 (8); Enterococcus faecalis, 44 (10)/49 (3)/7 (7); Bacterium megaterium, 56 (4)/42 (3)/2 (1); Streptococcus pyogenes, 48 (4)/46 (3)/6 (6); Escherichia coli, 46 (4)/47 (3)/7 (7); and Salmonella enterica sv. Typhimurium, 38 (3)/43 (7)/19 (10). A spectrum of antimicrobial peptides was identified in isolated mucus, which exhibited strong and contact-dependent antibacterial activity against both commensal and pathogenic bacteria. CONCLUSION: These findings show that secreted antimicrobial peptides are retained by the surface-overlaying mucus and thereby provide a combined physical and antibacterial barrier to prevent bacterial attachment and invasion. This distribution facilitates high local peptide concentration on vulnerable mucosal surfaces, while still allowing the presence of an enteric microbiota.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of DX-619, a novel Des-F (6)-quinolone against clinical isolates in China.
AB  - The aim of the study was to investigate in vitro antibacterial activity and bactericidal effect of DX-619 and other nine comparators against 1,101 recently collected clinical bacterial isolates in China. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of antimicrobials were determined by a CLSI recommended standard agar dilution method and the minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) were examined by the broth dilution method. Time-kill curves against representative isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, enterococci, and Klebsiellia pneumoniae were also conducted. DX-619 exhibited excellent antibacterial activity against 1,101 clinical isolates, especially to multi-drug resistant Gram-positive cocci. The MIC(90)s of DX-619 were < or =0.016 and 0.125 mg/L against methicillin-sensitive and -resistant S. aureus, 0.062 and 0.125 mg/L against methicillin-sensitive and -resistant S. epidermidis, respectively, which were 8-512 and 64-128 fold lower than those of comparative fluoroquinolones. The MIC(90)s of DX-619 for penicillin-sensitive and -non-sensitive Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium were 0.016, 0.062, 0.25 and 0.5 mg/L, respectively. The MIC(90)s of DX-619 against Enterobacteriaceae (except for Escherichia coli) and glucose-nonfermenting bacilli were < or =4 mg/L, which were comparable to other comparators. MBCs and time-kill curves showed that DX-619 was a potent bactericidal agent. There was no significant inoculum effect on MICs. But the activities of DX-619 against S. aureus, K. pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were decreased by acidic pH and human serum. DX-619 was a potent antibacterial compound against multi-drug resistant bacteria including Gram-positive cocci, such as S. aureus and enterococci, which may warrant further exploration.
TI  - Role of enteric fever in ileal perforations: an overstated problem in tropics?
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine the role of enteric fever in ileal perforations. METHODS: A prospective cohort of 47 patients of ileal perforation was subjected to clinical examination and investigations for APACHE II scoring. Blood, ulcer edge biopsy, mesenteric lymph node and peritoneal aspirate were subjected to culture to determine the predominant aerobic bacterial isolate and its antibiogram. RESULTS: Seven patients (14.9%) required intensive care and seven (14.9%) developed septicaemia. Mortality was 17%. Highest isolation rate was seen in ulcer edge (70.2%) followed by lymph node (66%) culture. The bacterial spectrum was Escherichia coli (23.4%), Enterococcus faecalis (21.3%), Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (6.3%), Salmonella enterica serovar Paratyphi A (4.2%), etc. CONCLUSIONS: Enteric fever organisms are not the predominant causative agents of ileal perforations. Culture of ulcer edge biopsy, lymph node is crucial for aetiological diagnosis. The use of APACHE II triaging and prescription of antimicrobials based on the local pattern of susceptibility profile of the aetiological agent is recommended.
TI  - Molecular analysis of BcrR, a membrane-bound bacitracin sensor and DNA-binding protein from Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - BcrR has been identified as a novel regulatory protein of high level bacitracin resistance encoded by the bcrABD operon in Enterococcus faecalis. The N-terminal domain of BcrR has similarity to the helix-turn-helix motif of DNA-binding proteins, and topological modeling predicts that the C-terminal domain contains four transmembrane alpha-helices. These data have led to the hypothesis that BcrR functions as both a membrane-bound sensor and transducer of bacitracin availability to regulate bcrABD expression. To characterize the bcrABD promoter and identify the promoter elements to which BcrR binds, a series of bcrA-lacZ fusions were constructed. A 69-bp region was identified that was essential for bacitracin-dependent bcrA-lacZ expression. Mutations that targeted this region were used to identify two inverted repeat sequences, each with the sequence 5'-GACA(N)(7)TGTC-3', on the bcrABD promoter that were required for bcrA-lacZ expression. To study BcrR binding to this region, we over-produced BcrR with a C-terminal hexa-histidine tag in Escherichia coli membranes, extracted the protein with n-dodecyl-beta-d-maltoside, and subsequently purified it via Ni(2+)-nitrilotriacetic acid and gel filtration chromatography to apparent homogeneity. Purified BcrR was reconstituted into liposomes, and BcrR binding to bcrABD promoter DNA was analyzed using electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Both inverted repeat sequences were required for BcrR binding, both in the presence and absence of bacitracin. These data demonstrate that membrane-bound BcrR binds specifically to the bcrABD promoter, irrespective of bacitracin concentration. We therefore propose that bacitracin-dependent induction of bcrABD expression by BcrR occurs after DNA binding.
TI  - Chemical markers for the evaluation of raw material hygienic quality in egg products.
AB  - The aim of this research was to study uracil and lactic and acetic acids as chemical markers for hygienic quality evaluation of raw material in liquid pasteurized egg products. Uracil, absent in sound whole eggs, was formed in raw and pasteurized egg products as a consequence of high microbial contamination (>10(6) cfu/g) after a sufficient lag time, remaining stable at 4 degrees C but disappearing after 7 days of storage at 25 degrees C. Both lactic and acetic acids, starting from initial values of 1-7 mg/kg dry matter, presented trends similar to that of uracil; however, acetic acid never decreased during the storage of raw egg products. With few exceptions, all three metabolites were produced by Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Morganella morganii, Serratia liquefaciens, Aeromonas hydrophyla, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Enterococcus avium, and Enterococcus faecalis, separately inoculated in whole egg samples. Uracil seems to be the most sensible marker, with a suggested limit corresponding to the detectable level.
TI  - Effect of Octenisept antiseptic on bioburden of neoplastic ulcers in patients with advanced cancer.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of octenidine dihydrochloride (Octenisept, Schulke & Mayr) on the clinical condition and bacterial flora in neoplastic ulcers. METHOD: Twenty-one patients with advanced cancer and neoplastic ulcers were included in the study. Octenisept-moistened gauze dressings were applied to the ulcers three times daily. The clinical and bacteriological status of the wounds were assessed at baseline and after three weeks of treatment. RESULTS: Thirty-three bacterial strains were cultured at baseline. After three weeks of treatment, the tests were repeated on 16 patients. Clinical observations confirmed an improvement in the clinical condition of the ulcers, characterised by a reduction in necrosis, exudate levels, erythema and oedema. According to the bacteriological assessment, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Proteus mirabilis were eradicated from the wounds. Enterococcus faecalis persisted in two patients, Escherichia coli in one patient and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in another patient. CONCLUSION: Octenispet was an effective antimicrobial: Staphylococcus aureus and Proteus mirabilis were eradicated in all ulcers. After three weeks of treatment, none of the ulcers developed an infection and there was an improvement in their clinical condition.
TI  - Survival of enteric microorganisms on grass surfaces irrigated with treated effluent.
AB  - Treated effluent can be reused for the irrigation of parks and sports grounds but there is an associated potential public health risks from microbial pathogens present on the grass surface, particularly when used for contact sports. The main aim of this study was to investigate the survival of pathogenic and indicator microorganisms on the grass surface of a sports ground irrigated with treated effluent under differing climatic conditions. Results showed that Salmonella enterica serotype typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus decayed faster under direct sunlight than MS2 with one log(10) reduction (T(90)) varying from 3 to 11 hours. Rapid decay (T(90) 3 to 4 hours) of bacterial pathogens occurred in both sunlight and shade during the summer. In contrast, T(90) times for the bacteria during the winter varied from 6 to 11 hours in direct sunlight and from 23 to 38 hours in shade. No significant seasonal variation was observed in the inactivation of the bacteriophage MS2. Enteric viruses are expected to show inactivation rates similar to MS2. The results show that rapid inactivation of enteric bacteria can be expected on grass surface irrigated with treated effluent at higher ambient temperatures, in direct sunlight and low moisture content.
TI  - [Omphalitis with fatal outcome in new-born baby boy].
AB  - Omphalitis is a serious condition with important morbidity and mortality, especially in developing countries. The most commonly involved micro-organisms are Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We describe a Danish patient with cellulitis, severe septicaemia, and portal vein thrombosis as fatal complications of omphalitis. In spite of early recognition and prompt treatment in this case, it was not possible to save the child.
TI  - Succession of dominant and antagonistic lactic acid bacteria in fermented cucumber: insights from a PCR-based approach.
AB  - The goal of the investigation was to study the succession of major groups of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and their antagonism in salt-fermented cucumber using PCR. In a direct detection method as well as a short enrichment process, PCR enabled detection of Leuconostoc and Lactobacillus during early hours of fermentation. Subsequently, Lactobacillus and Pediococcus emerged as the dominant genera. Nucleic acid sequence of culture-independent clones confirmed the detection of Pediococcus as a dominant genera emerging during late stages of fermentation. PCR also revealed time-dependent emergence of mesentericin, pediocin and plantaricin A producers and accounted for the LAB succession in the fermenting samples. A total of 328 LAB isolates were obtained collectively from 30 cucumber samples, of which PCR could identify an overwhelming 186 Lactobacillus isolates followed by 113 Pediococcus and 29 Leuconostoc isolates, respectively. Based on antimicrobial assay against target strain Leuconostoc mesenteroides NRRL B640, 28% of the LAB were bacteriocin producers, of which pediocin producers were substantial, followed by plantaricin A and mesentericin producers. The bacteriocins elaborated by the isolates were active against a large number of Gram-positive target LAB strains and pathogenic bacteria including Bacillus cereus, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Screening of the enterocin genes and antimicrobial activity against pathogenic bacteria in Enterococcus strains obtained from different origins.
AB  - Antimicrobial activities of 139 Enterococcus isolates (48 E. faecium and 91 E. faecalis) obtained from canine feces, boiler meat samples, swine feces, wild waterfowl feces, and human feces were examined against respective bacteria, including Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella Enteritidis, and Escherichia coli. Bacteriocin (BAC) production assay revealed that the antimicrobial activity against at least one of 6 indicator strains (BAC+ phenotype) was found in 51 (37%) isolates (29 E. faecium and 22 E. faecalis). Twenty-four of 46 isolates positive for at least one of the enterocin structural genes (entA, entB, entL50AB, and cylL) showed a BAC+ phenotype. The existence of other enterocins or nonenterocin factors was implied because the BAC+ phenotype was detected in a total of 27 Enterococcus isolates that had none of the enterocin genes tested. The antimicrobial activity against Gram-negative strains (Salmonella Enteritidis and E. coli) was detected in the 6 Enterococcus isolates that had either the entA, entB, entL50AB or cylL genes. Moreover, the proportion of the antimicrobial activity against L. monocytogenes among the cylL-positive E. faecalis isolates showing beta-hemolysis (10/16) was significantly (p<0.01) higher than among those lacking beta-hemolysis (2/15). The results suggested that certain characteristics are likely to be associated with the antimicrobial activity against specific organisms.
TI  - Automated classification of bacterial particles in flow by multiangle scatter measurement and support vector machine classifier.
AB  - Biological microparticles, including bacteria, scatter light in all directions when illuminated. The complex scatter pattern is dependent on particle size, shape, refraction index, density, and morphology. Commercial flow cytometers allow measurement of scattered light intensity at forward and perpendicular (side) angles (2 degrees <or= theta(1) <or= 20 degrees and 70 degrees <or= theta(2) <or= 110 degrees, respectively) with a speed varying from 10 to 10,000 particles per second. The choice of angle is dictated by the fact that scattered light in the forward region is primarily dependent on cell size and refractive index, whereas side-scatter intensity is dependent on the granularity of cellular structures. However, these two-parameter measurements cannot be used to separate populations of cells of similar shape, size, or structure. Hence, there have been several attempts in flow cytometry to measure the entire scatter patterns. The published concepts require the use of unique custom-built flow cytometers and cannot be applied to existing instruments. It was also not clear how much information about patterns is really necessary to separate various populations of cells present in a given sample. The presented work demonstrates application of pattern-recognition techniques to classify particles on the basis of their discrete scatter patterns collected at just five different angles, and accompanied by the measurement of axial light loss. The proposed approach can be potentially used with existing instruments because it requires only the addition of a compact enhanced scatter detector. An analytical model of scatter of laser beams by individual bacterial cells suspended in a fluid was used to determine the location of scatter sensors. Experimental results were used to train the support vector machine-based pattern recognition system. It has been shown that information provided just by five angles of scatter and axial light loss can be sufficient to recognize various bacteria with 68-99% success rate.
TI  - Comparative study of leaf and stem bark extracts of Parkia biglobosa against enterobacteria.
AB  - Hydroethanolic and aqueous extracts of leaf and stem bark of Parkia biglobosa (Jacq) Benth. (Mimosaceae) were tested against clinical isolates Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, Shigella dysenteriae and Enterococcus faecalis, and corresponding collection strains E. coli CIP 105 182, Salmonella enterica CIP 105 150, Shigella dysenteriae CIP 54-51 and Enterococcus faecalis CIP 103 907. Discs of Gentamicin, a broad spectrum antibiotic were used as positive controls. The results showed that all the extracts possess antimicrobial activities. A comparative study of the antibacterial activity of the leaves and that of the bark showed that for all the tested microorganisms, the hydroalcoholic extract of the bark is more active than the aqueous extract of the leaf. The hydroethanolic extract of the leaves is as effective as the aqueous extract of the stem bark prescribed by the traditional healer, suggesting it is possible to use leaves other than the roots and bark. The phytochemical screening showed that sterols and triterpenes, saponosides, tannins, reducing compounds, coumarins, anthocyanosides, flavonosides are present in both bark and leaf but in different concentrations.
TI  - Antimicrobial action of a filling paste used in pulp therapy in primary teeth under different storage conditions.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Compare the antimicrobial effectiveness of common antimicrobial paste  immediately after pulp therapy and in different storage conditions. STUDY DESIGN: Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus oralis, Enterococcus faecalis; Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis sample were used. The storage conditions utilized were: at room temperature--the paste was subjected to a natural aging process at room temperature for a 24-hour and 7, 14, 28, 60 and 90 day periods (GPRT). Refrigerator storage--the paste was placed to a natural aging process in a refrigerator at 4 degrees C for a 24 hour and 7.14, 28, 60 and 90 day periods (GPR). To perform the immediate effect analysis (GPi or zero time), of each mixture either at room or refrigerator temperature, the preparation procedure was similar, although GPR, iodoform, Rifocort and camphorated paramonochlorophenol were stored in the refrigerator and then taken out, dosed and manipulated, and had their immediate effect tested after a 1-week period at storage of 4 degrees C average temperature. The testing methodology was Dilution in Solid Medium-Agar. The Wilcoxon Test and Friedman variance analyses were used. RESULTS: The GP paste showed antimicrobial activity at all experimental times. CONCLUSION: The pastes presented antimicrobial effectiveness at all experimental times.
TI  - Cleaning and handling implements as potential reservoirs for bacterial contamination of some ready-to-eat foods in retail delicatessen environments.
AB  - This study assessed the association of bacteria with cleaning tools, such as floor mops (n = 25) and cleaning cloths (n = 39), and handling devices, such as disposable plastic gloves (n = 20), used during filled baguette and assorted salad preparation in four selected retail delicatessens in Johannesburg, South Africa. Samples of each cleaning or handling tool were prepared for aerobic (APC), coliform (CC), Escherichia coli (EC), Bacillus cereus (BCC), and Staphylococcus aureus (SAC) counts, as well as tested for the incidence of Listeria monocytogenes (LM) and Salmonella (SALM) by standard plating methods. Bacterial populations attached to the cleaning and handling tools were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Ten selected gram-positive isolates were further analyzed by 16S rRNA sequence analysis and compared with isolates from filled baguettes and assorted salads. The floor mops consistently yielded the highest APCs, CCs, and ECs (5.7, 4.1, and 3.0 log CFU/g, respectively), while gloves had the lowest corresponding counts (3.6, 2.0, and 1.0 log CFU/g, respectively). Low BCCs and SACs were recorded in this study (ca. 1.2 log CFU/g), while SALM and LM were each detected in five cleaning tool samples. SEM showed rods and cocci attached to handling and cleaning tools. Furthermore, results of 16S rRNA sequence analysis indicated that several gram-positive isolates were identified as S. aureus, Staphylococcus pasteuri, Staphylococcus sciuri, and Enterococcus faecalis. Genetically similar strains (100% similarity) were isolated from cleaning and handling tools and associated ready-to-eat (RTE) foods. Cleaning and handling tools may act as reservoirs of contamination for RTE foods during preparation in retail delicatessens in South Africa. The transfer of potential pathogens, such as S. aureus, to foods from cleaning and handling tools may hold food safety implications.
TI  - Efficacy of the bovine antimicrobial peptide indolicidin combined with piperacillin/tazobactam in experimental rat models of polymicrobial peritonitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the efficacy of piperacillin/tazobactam combined with indolicidin in the prevention of lethality in two rat models of polymicrobial peritonitis. DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, controlled animal study. SETTING: Research laboratory in a university hospital. SUBJECTS: Adult male Wistar rats. INTERVENTIONS: Adult male Wistar rats were given an intraperitoneal injection of 1 mg of Escherichia coli 0111:B4 lipopolysaccharide or had intraabdominal sepsis induced by cecal ligation and puncture. For each model, all animals were randomized to receive isotonic sodium chloride solution intraperitoneally, 1 mg/kg indolicidin, 120 mg/kg piperacillin/tazobactam, and 1 mg/kg indolicidin combined with 120 mg/kg piperacillin/tazobactam. Each group included 20 animals. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Main outcome measures were: bacterial growth in blood, peritoneum, spleen, liver, and mesenteric lymph nodes; endotoxin, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha concentrations in plasma; and lethality. All compounds reduced significantly bacterial growth and lethality compared with saline treatment. Treatment with indolicidin resulted in significant decrease in plasma endotoxin and cytokine levels, whereas piperacillin/tazobactam exerted the opposite effect. The combination between indolicidin and piperacillin/tazobactam proved to be the most effective treatment in reducing all variables measured. CONCLUSION: Indolicidin may have potential therapeutic usefulness alone and when associated with piperacillin/tazobactam in polymicrobial peritonitis.
TI  - Entamoeba histolytica: cyst-like structures in vitro induction.
AB  - The cyst of Entamoeba histolytica is responsible for amebiasis infection. However, no axenic in vitro system exists that promotes mass encystation for studying this process of this human-infecting parasite. Cyst-like structures of E. histolytica obtained in this work were induced using TYI-S-33 media in combination with enterobacterias Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis conditioned media, high CO2 tension and histamine. Cyst-like structures showed the same characteristics of a typical E. histolytica cyst: aggregation, resistance to 0.15% sarcosyl for 10 min, high signal of fluorescence under UV light when stained with 10% calcofluor M2r and the surface topology showed a wrinkled wall. In addition these structures are multinucleated with condensed chromatin attached to nuclear membrane, contain big vacuoles and ribonucleoproteic helices in the cytoplasm and also present a thin cell wall. Last all characteristics are all the same as a typical of E. histolytica cyst.
TI  - Tachyplesin III and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor enhance the efficacy of tazobactam/piperacillin in a neutropenic mouse model of polymicrobial peritonitis.
AB  - We investigated the efficacy of tazobactam/piperacillin (TZP), tachyplesin III and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) in an experimental murine neutropenic intraabdominal infection. BALB/c male mice were rendered neutropenic by intraperitoneal administration of cyclophosphamide on days -4 and -2 pre-infection. Septic shock was induced by cecal ligation and puncture. Animals received intravenously isotonic sodium chloride solution (control group C1), 1mg/kg of tachyplesin III, 120 mg/kg of TZP, 0.1mg/kg of G-CSF, tachyplesin III plus TZP, G-CSF plus TZP and finally tachyplesin III plus G-CSF plus TZP, respectively. Lethality, bacterial growth in blood, peritoneum, spleen, liver, and mesenteric lymph nodes, endotoxin, IL-6 and TNF-alpha concentrations in plasma were evaluated. All compounds reduced the lethality when compared to controls. Endotoxin and cytokine plasma levels were significantly higher in TZP-treated animals compared to tachyplesin III-treated animals. Finally, all drug combinations showed to be the most effective treatment in reducing all variables measured. Interestingly, the strongest results concerning the bacterial growth inhibition, lethality and endotoxemia were obtained when the three compounds were contemporaneously administered. The presence of their positive interaction makes tachyplesin III and G-CSF potentially valuable as an adjuvant for antimicrobial chemotherapy of sepsis.
TI  - Heme oxygenase-1-derived carbon monoxide enhances the host defense response to microbial sepsis in mice.
AB  - Sepsis is characterized by a systemic response to severe infection. Although the  inflammatory phase of sepsis helps eradicate the infection, it can have detrimental consequences if left unchecked. Therapy directed against inflammatory mediators of sepsis has shown little success and has the potential to impair innate antimicrobial defenses. Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and the product of its enzymatic reaction, CO, have beneficial antiinflammatory properties, but little is known about their effects on microbial sepsis. Here, we have demonstrated that during microbial sepsis, HO-1-derived CO plays an important role in the antimicrobial process without inhibiting the inflammatory response. HO-1-deficient mice suffered exaggerated lethality from polymicrobial sepsis. Targeting HO-1 to SMCs and myofibroblasts of blood vessels and bowel ameliorated sepsis-induced death associated with Enterococcus faecalis, but not Escherichia coli, infection. The increase in HO-1 expression did not suppress circulating inflammatory cells or their accumulation at the site of injury but did enhance bacterial clearance by increasing phagocytosis and the endogenous antimicrobial response. Furthermore, injection of a CO-releasing molecule into WT mice increased phagocytosis and rescued HO-1-deficient mice from sepsis-induced lethality. These data advocate HO-1-derived CO as an important mediator of the host defense response to sepsis and suggest CO administration as a possible treatment for the disease.
TI  - Characterization of site-specific recombination by the integrase MJ1 from enterococcal bacteriophage phiFC1.
AB  - Bacteriophage phiFC1 integrase (MJ1) was previously shown to perform a site-specific recombination between a phage attachment site (attP) and a host attachment site (attB) in its host, Enterococcus faecalis, and also in a non-host bacterium, Escherichia coli. Here, we investigated biochemical features of MJ1 integrase. First, MJ1 integrase could perform in vitro recombination between attP and attB in the absence of additional factors. Second, MJ1 integrase interacted with att sites. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and DNase I footprinting revealed that MJ1 integrase could efficiently bind to all the att sites and that MJ1 integrase recognized relatively short sequences (approximately 50 bp) containing an overlapping region within attB and attP. These results demonstrate that MJ1 integrase indeed catalyzes an integrative recombination between attP and attB, the mechanism of which might be simple and unidirectional, as found in serine integrases.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance in 11 hospitals in Puerto Rico: results of an antimicrobial resistance management (ARM) program.
AB  - PURPOSE: The Antimicrobial Resistance Management Program (ARMP) was established in 1997 at the University of Florida as an ongoing project to document trends in antimicrobial susceptibility patterns in inpatient/outpatient isolates and track resistance that may occur with specific antibiotic use. METHODS: Institutions are enrolled at no charge and provide a minimum of 3 years of antibiogram/sensitivity report data, which are reviewed to create a customized analysis of antimicrobial susceptibility trends benchmarked against national/regional comparators. The data, in a HIPAA-compliant non-identifying format, comprise a national aggregate database of 28.4 million isolates from 358 institutions. This database was interrogated to determine resistance rates for eleven hospitals in Puerto Rico from 1998-2003 and, as comparators, those in the database from the State of Florida and all U.S. institutions. RESULTS: Between 1996-2003, data on 328,837 isolates collected from 11 hospitals throughout Puerto Rico, 5,388,897 isolates from 46 institutions in Florida, and 24,951,098 isolates from 358 U.S. institutions for the following organisms (number of antibiotics tested against) were reviewed for susceptibility: coagulase-negative staphylococci (14)/Staphylococcus epidermidis (18), Enterococcus faecalis (7), Enterococcus faecium (5), Enterococcus species (4), Escherichia coli (24), Klebsiella pneumoniae (24), Proteus mirabilis (22), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (14), Serratia marcescens (22), Staphylococcus aureus (23), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (9). Antimicrobial resistance in Puerto Rico varied organism to organism from that observed in Florida and nationally. CONCLUSIONS: This first broad analysis of antimicrobial resistance in Puerto Rico provides important baseline data, both for sentinel surveillance programs and for determining strategies for intervention.
TI  - Development of a sanitizing fabric wipe for use on food contact surfaces.
AB  - A sanitizer was incorporated into disposable sanitary wipes that were used to eliminate microorganisms on plastic and metal surfaces. These surfaces were inoculated with strains of Bacillus subtilis OSU 494, Enterococcus faecalis OSU 48, Escherichia coli ATCC 29181, Listeria innocua ATCC 33090, Pseudomonas aeruginosa OSU 167, Salmonella enteritidis OSU 799, Staphylococcus epidermidis OSU 838), Candida albicans ATCC 10231, and Aspergillus fumigatus ATCC 10894. These inoculated surfaces were cleaned with the wipes for 5, 10, and 30 s, then organisms surviving on the cleaned surfaces and in the wipes were enumerated. Applying the sanitizing wipe to the plastic and metal surfaces reduced the viability of bacteria (> log 4 for 5 s), yeast cells (> log 5 for 10 s), and fungal spores (< log 4 for all times). The use of large pore sized or thick wipes showed better sanitizing result when compared with the use of the small pore sized and slim wipe. There were no significant differences (P > 0.05) between surviving numbers on the surface of the plastic compared with that of the metal.
TI  - Improved diagnosis specificity in bone and joint infections using molecular techniques.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The microbiological diagnosis of osteoarticular infections currently  relies on microbiological cultures, to specifically target treatment. However, these conventional methods sometimes lack of sensitivity and of specificity to establish definitive diagnosis. This study was conducted to determine whether molecular method could improve bacterial bone and joint infection diagnosis. METHODS: We evaluated the performance of nucleic acid extraction with the semi-automated NucliSens miniMAG instrument coupled to 16S rDNA sequencing on 76 samples collected from 51 patients with suspected infections: prosthetic-joint infection (15), spondylodiscitis (7) acute septic arthritis (11) and 18 controls. No pre-treatment of the sample was done before nucleic acid extraction. Classification in infected group required an accumulation of arguments. RESULTS: Our molecular method identified a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria including Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis, Salmonella enterica, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and fastidious bacteria like Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Fusobacterium nucleatum. The overall PCR sensitivity was 73.3%: 53.8% for prosthetic-joint infections and 88.2% for infections without prostheses. The overall PCR specificity was 95.2%, whereas culture specificity was only 85.7%. CONCLUSIONS: The instrument was simple to use and provided nucleic acids free of PCR inhibitors and free of contamination by foreign bacterial DNA. Our study highlights the need for still improved molecular diagnostic sensitivity.
TI  - Reduction of bacteria on spinach, lettuce, and surfaces in food service areas using neutral electrolyzed oxidizing water.
AB  - Food safety issues and increases in food borne illnesses have promulgated the development of new sanitation methods to eliminate pathogenic organisms on foods and surfaces in food service areas. Electrolyzed oxidizing water (EO water) shows promise as an environmentally friendly broad spectrum microbial decontamination agent. EO water is generated by the passage of a dilute salt solution ( approximately 1% NaCl) through an electrochemical cell. This electrolytic process converts chloride ions and water molecules into chlorine oxidants (Cl(2), HOCl/ClO(-)). At a near-neutral pH (pH 6.3-6.5), the predominant chemical species is the highly biocidal hypochlorous acid species (HOCl) with the oxidation reduction potential (ORP) of the solution ranging from 800 to 900mV. The biocidal activity of near-neutral EO water was evaluated at 25 degrees C using pure cultures of Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, and Enterococcus faecalis. Treatment of these organisms, in pure culture, with EO water at concentrations of 20, 50, 100, and 120ppm total residual chlorine (TRC) and 10min of contact time resulted in 100% inactivation of all five organisms (reduction of 6.1-6.7log(10)CFU/mL). Spray treatment of surfaces in food service areas with EO water containing 278-310ppm TRC (pH 6.38) resulted in a 79-100% reduction of microbial growth. Dip (10min) treatment of spinach at 100 and 120ppm TRC resulted in a 4.0-5.0log(10)CFU/mL reduction of bacterial counts for all organisms tested. Dipping (10min) of lettuce at 100 and 120ppm TRC reduced bacterial counts of E. coli by 0.24-0.25log(10)CFU/mL and reduced all other organisms by 2.43-3.81log(10)CFU/mL.
TI  - [Typical bacteria in an intensive care burn unit in severely burned patients and  their importance with regard to mortality: retrospective study 1995 - 2004].
AB  - The purpose of this study was to identify risk profiles for wound infection of severely burned patients in a retrospective analysis of patients of an intensive care burn unit during 1995 - 2004. The goal of this study was to identify risk factors on wound infection in severely burned patients. Possible influences on mortality were to be discussed. Inclusion criteria of the study population was a minimum age of 18 years and a body surface area burned of at least 40 % during the time period 1995 - 2004. 912 patients were screened and 96 patients were enrolled. Logistic regression was performed to investigate factors influencing wound infection and mortality in the study population. The initially detectable bacteria in the burn wounds were Staphylococcus aureus (21.1 %), Staphylococcus epidermidis (16.2 %) and Enterococcus faecalis (16.2 %). Of all swabs taken the most frequent initial discovered bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus (18.2 %), Staphylococcus epidermidis (12.7 %), Enterococcus faecalis (12.7 %) and Escherichia coli (13.3 %). The majority of positive swabs were the burn wound followed by nose and tracheal secretion. The risk of a wound infection was more likely in the period 2000 - 2004 in comparison to 1995 - 1999 with an Odds Ratio of 0.17 (95 % KI [0.05 - 0.63], p = 0.008). Wound infection was promoted by longer hospitalization on the burn intensive care unit with an Odds Ratio of 2.62 (95 % KI [1.34 - 5.11], p = 0.005) and by bacterial detection in the unburned parts of the body with an Odds Ratio of 5.36 (95 % KI [1.30 - 22.24], p = 0.02). Death was significantly promoted by age (over 50 years) with an Odds Ratio of 11.62 (95 % KI [2.76 - 48.92], p = 0.0008), wound infection with an Odds Ratio of 0.12 (95 % KI [0.03 - 0.52], p = 0.004) and inhalation injury with an Odds Ratio of 5.95 (95 % KI [1.72 - 20.55], p = 0.005). During the study period a rise of wound infections could be notified. Promoting factors were longer hospitalization on the burn intensive care unit and bacterial detection in the unburned parts of the body. Regarding mortality, higher age, wound infection and inhalation injury were prognostic factors.
TI  - Processing of as-48ABC RNA in AS-48 enterocin production by Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - Enterocin AS-48 production and immunity characters are encoded by 10 genes (as-48ABCC(1)DD(1)EFGH) of the pMB2 plasmid from the Enterococcus faecalis S-48 strain. Among these, as-48A, encoding the AS-48 peptide, and the as-48BC genes constitute a cluster required for AS-48 biogenesis and full immunity. In this study, the levels of expression of this cluster have been altered by insertion and site-directed mutagenesis as well as by expression coupled to trans complementation. Phenotypic studies of the mutants have indicated cotranscription of the three genes and revealed that the inactivation of as-48B prevents the production of AS-48, thus confirming its essentiality in AS-48 biogenesis. These studies have also supported the involvement of as-48C in enterocin immunity. In addition, they established that the intergenic region between the as-48A and as-48B genes is decisive for AS-48 expression, since a 3-bp substitution, which should disrupt a potential 47-nucleotide complex secondary structure, resulted in a hypoproducing phenotype. Transcriptional analyses of the E. faecalis wild-type and mutant strains supports the possibility that the as-48ABC genes are transcribed from the P(A) promoter located upstream of as-48A. Moreover, analysis and bioinformatic predictions of RNA folding indicate that as-48ABC mRNA is processed at the secondary structure located between as-48A and as-48B. Thus, synthesis of the AS-48 peptide appears to be controlled at the posttranscriptional level and is uncoupled from as-48BC translation. This mechanism of genetic regulation has not been previously described for the regulation of bacteriocin expression in enterococci.

TI  - Inhibitory effect of Gram-negative and Gram-positive microorganisms against Helicobacter pylori clinical isolates.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the in vitro inhibitory effect of several Gram-negative  and Gram-positive microorganisms against Helicobacter pylori clinical isolates. METHODS: The in vitro effect of 32 microorganisms against H. pylori clinical isolates was determined by a diffusion method. Time-kill assay was performed with two Staphylococcus spp. strains. RESULTS: Anti-H. pylori activity was detected with Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Bacillus spp., 1 Enterococcus faecium and 2 Lactobacillus spp. against 7, 11, 1, 5 and 6 H. pylori strains tested. All Staphylococcus spp. showed an anti-H. pylori effect: one Staphylococcus auricularis and two Staphylococcus epidermidis against all H. pylori tested; Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus hominis and S. auricularis against six, five and seven H. pylori strains; and two other coagulase-negative Staphylococcus against one H. pylori strain. An inhibitory effect was detected with one Escherichia coli against one H. pylori. Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella spp. and Acinetobacter baumannii showed activity against four H. pylori strains, and Enterobacter cloacae and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia showed activity against 14 H. pylori isolates. No anti-H. pylori activity was detected with one Lactobacillus spp., two Lactococcus lactis, four Streptococcus spp., one Bacillus cereus, one E. faecium, one Enterococcus faecalis, one E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella oxytoca. Time-kill assay showed bactericidal activity at 24 h with the two Staphylococcus spp. strains tested. CONCLUSIONS: Several strains of human pathogens or commensal bacteria are able to inhibit H. pylori growth in vitro and it is a strain-dependent phenomenon.
TI  - Consumption of Camembert cheese stimulates commensal enterococci in healthy human intestinal microbiota.
AB  - Enterococci are natural inhabitants of the human gastrointestinal tract and the main Gram-positive and facultative anaerobic cocci recovered in human faeces. They are also present in a variety of fermented dairy and meat products, and some rare isolates are responsible for severe infections such as endocarditis and meningitis. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of Camembert cheese consumption by healthy human volunteers on the faecal enterococcal population. A highly specific real-time quantitative PCR approach was designed and used to type enterococcal species in human faeces. Two species were found, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium, and only the Enterococcus faecalis population was significantly enhanced after Camembert cheese consumption, whereas Escherichia coli population and the dominant microbiota remained unaffected throughout the trial.

TI  - Antibiotic pretreatment of hydrogel ureteral stent.
AB  - PURPOSE: To compare bacterial adhesion to hydrogel-coated and uncoated ureteral stents. The antimicrobial activity of coated and uncoated stents treated with commonly used antibiotic solutions also was evaluated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Hydrogel coated and uncoated stent segments were dipped in different antibiotic solutions (ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, and cefazolin). Normal saline was used as the control. The segments were incubated in separate broths of Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis to reach the log phase. They were sonicated to free the bacteria, and colony-forming units were determined after 48 hours. To evaluate antibacterial activity, hydrogel-coated and uncoated stent segments were dipped in the above-mentioned antibiotic solutions. Normal saline was used as the control. Segments were incubated in separate Mueller-Hinton agar plates inoculated with E. coli or Enterococcus faecalis, and the zones of inhibition were determined at 24 hours. The duration of antibacterial activity for each bacterium-antibiotic combination also was studied. RESULTS: Hydrogel coating did not significantly reduce bacterial adhesion. Zones of inhibition around stent pieces dipped in antibiotic solutions differed with the organism and the antibiotic. Cefazolin produced a significantly larger zone of inhibition with hydrogel-coated stent, but the duration of antibacterial activity was similar to that of uncoated stent. Hydrophilic coating significantly increased the duration of antibacterial activity of ciprofloxacin and gentamicin. CONCLUSION: Hydrogel coating on the surface of ureteral stents does not prevent or reduce bacterial adhesion. However, after antibiotic treatment, stents exhibit antibacterial activity in the local environment at greater intensity and for a longer time, depending on the bacterium-antibiotic combination.
TI  - Preoperative sterilization and disinfection of drill guide templates.
AB  - The aim of the in vitro study was to evaluate the decontamination potential of common antiseptic solutions for heat-sensitive implantological drill guide templates. One hundred implantologists were evaluated on the basis of a questionnaire for their measures of disinfection. On the basis of these results, 80% alcohol, Octenidine 0.1%, and Chlorhexidine 0.12% were tested in an in vitro model for their decontamination efficacy for heat-sensitive plastic material infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, and Candida albicans. The microorganisms were selected on the basis of results of environmental testing of dental laboratories. The results of the questionnaire revealed that Chlorhexidine was used by 30%, 80% alcohol by 23%, and Octenidine by 7% of the dentists. Using the in vitro model, with the exception of S. aureus, Chlorhexidine was not able to completely eliminate the microorganisms after 15 min of application. In contrast, the treatment with Octenidine revealed no further growth of the tested microorganisms after that time. The 80% alcohol was more efficient. No growth of microorganisms could be detected in any of the tests after 5 min of incubation. On the basis of our results and due to the fact that suitable installations for sterilization were hardly used by the dental practitioners, the disinfection of templates should be preferentially performed with 80% alcohol or Octenidine using an incubation time of 15 min with ultrasonication.

TI  - Antimicrobial activity of some Salvia species essential oils from Iran.
AB  - The aerial parts of Salvia multicaulis, S. sclarea and S. verticillata were collected at full flowering stage. The essential oils were isolated by hydrodistillation and analyzed by combination of capillary GC and GC-MS. The in vitro antimicrobial activity of the essential oils were studied against eight Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus pumulis, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae) and three fungi (Candida albicans, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Aspergillus niger). The results of antibacterial activity tests of the essential oils according to the disc diffusion method and MIC values indicated that all the samples have moderate to high inhibitory activity against the tested bacteria except for P. aeruginosa which was totally resistant. In contrast to antibacterial activity, the oils exhibited no or slight antifungal property, in which only the oil of S. multicaulis showed weak activity against two tested yeasts, C. albicans and S. cerevisiae.
TI  - Mathematical models of cobalt and iron ions catalyzed microwave bacterial deactivation.
AB  - Time differences for Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli survival during microwave irradiation (power 130 W) in the presence of aqueous cobalt and iron ions were investigated. Measured dependencies had "bell" shape forms with maximum bacterial viability between 1 - 2 min becoming insignificant at 3 minutes. The deactivation time for E. faecalis, S. aureus and E.coli in the presence of metal ions were smaller compared to a water control (4 -5 min). Although various sensitivities to the metal ions were observed, S. aureus and E. coli and were the most sensitive for cobalt and iron, respectively. The rapid reduction of viable bacteria during microwave treatment in the presence of metal ions could be explained by increased metal ion penetration into bacteria. Additionally, microwave irradiation may have increased the kinetic energy of the metal ions resulting in lower survival rates. The proposed mathematical model for microwave heating took into account the "growth" and "death" factors of the bacteria, forming second degree polynomial functions. Good relationships were found between the proposed mathematical models and the experimental data for bacterial deactivation (coefficient of correlation 0.91 - 0.99).
TI  - Characterization and technological properties of Staphylococcus xylosus strains isolated from a Tunisian traditional salted meat.
AB  - The technological properties of strains of Staphylococcus xylosus were studied to select the most suitable for use as starter cultures for the production of dried fermented meat products. Strains of S. xylosus were isolated from traditional salted Tunisian meat and were identified by biochemical and molecular methods. Thirty strains of S. xylosus were studied to evaluate their catalase, nitrate reductase, lipolytic, proteolytic and antibacterial activities as well as growth ability at different temperatures, pH's and NaCl concentrations. All strains of S. xylosus had catalase activity and were able to reduce nitrates to nitrites. The nitrate reductase activity increased when the strains were kept under anaerobic conditions. Proteolytic activity on milk and on gelatin agar was demonstrated for 100% and 83.3% of the S. xylosus isolates, respectively. However extracellular proteolytic activity as assessed by the azocasein method was poor in all the strains. Lipolytic activity as assessed by the agar method showed that 76.6% of strains of S. xylosus could hydrolyze Tween 20 against 33.3% that could hydrolyze tributyrin. Tween 80 was hydrolyzed by only 10% of strains. Strains of S. xylosus hydrolyzed pork fat better than beef and lamb fat. The majority of strains had antibacterial activity against Salmonella arizonae, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeuroginosa, Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis.
TI  - Development of flexible antimicrobial films using essential oils as active agents.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity in the vapor-phase of laboratory-made flexible films of polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene/ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer (PE/EVOH) incorporating essential oil of cinnamon ( Cinnamomum zeylanicum), oregano ( Origanum vulgare), clove ( Syzygium aromaticum), or cinnamon fortified with cinnamaldehyde was evaluated against a wide range of microorganisms: the Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli, Yersinia enterocolitica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella choleraesuis; the Gram-positive bacteria Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, and Enterococcus faecalis; the molds Penicillium islandicum, Penicillium roqueforti, Penicillium nalgiovense, Eurotium repens, and A spergillus flavus and the yeasts Candida albicans, Debaryomyces hansenii, and Zigosaccharomyces rouxii. Films with a nominal concentration of 4% (w/w) of fortified cinnamon or oregano essential oil completely inhibited the growth of the fungi; higher concentrations were required to inhibit the Gram-positive bacteria (8 and 10%, respectively), and higher concentrations still were necessary to inhibit the Gram-negative bacteria. PP films were more effective than PE/EVOH films. The atmospheres generated by the antimicrobial films inside Petri dishes were quantitatively analyzed using headspace-single drop microextraction (HS-SDME) in combination with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The analyses showed that the oregano-fortified PP films released higher levels of carvacrol and thymol, and the cinnamon-fortified PP films released higher levels of cinnamaldehyde, during the first 3-6 h of incubation, than the corresponding PE/EVOH films. Shelf-life tests were also performed, demonstrating that the antifungal activities of the films persisted for more than two months after their manufacture. In addition, migration tests (overall and specific) were performed, using both aqueous and fatty simulants, to ensure that the films meet EU regulations regarding food contact materials. Following contact with the tested films, the substances that had migrated into the aqueous simulants were recovered by direct immersion-single drop extraction (DI-SDME) and then analyzed by GC-MS. The fatty stimulant (isooctane) was directly injected into the chromatographic system.
TI  - Diversity of bacterial isolates from commercial and homemade composts.
AB  - The diversity of heterotrophic bacterial isolates of three commercial and two homemade composts was studied. The commercial composts were produced from poultry litter (PC), sewage sludge (SC), municipal solid waste (MC), and homemade composts (thermal compost [DC] and vermicompost [VC]) from food wastes. The taxonomic and physiological diversity of the heterotrophic culturable bacteria was assessed using phenotypic and genotypic characterization and the analysis of the partial 16S rRNA gene sequence. Composts DC and SC presented the higher genotypic diversity, as could be inferred from the number of distinct genotypic patterns observed, 28 and 21, respectively. Gram-positive bacteria, mainly Firmicutes, were predominant in all the composts. Some organisms related with taxa rarely reported in composts, as Rhodanobacter spathiphylli, Moraxella osloensis, Lysobacter, Corynebacterium, Pigmentiphaga kullae, and new taxa were also isolated. The highest relative proportion of isolates able to degrade starch was found in compost SC (> 70%), to degrade gelatine in compost DC (> 70%), to degrade Tween 80 in compost PC (> 90%), and to degrade poly-epsilon-caprolactones in compost DC (> 80%). Compost MC presented the lowest relative proportions of isolates able to degrade starch (< 25%), gelatine (< 20%), and poly-epsilon-caprolactone (< 40%). When compared with the others, the homemade composts presented higher relative proportions of Gram-positive isolates able to inhibit the target organisms Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In compost MC, none of the Gram-positive isolates was able to inhibit those targets.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility among organisms from the Asia/Pacific Rim, Europe and Latin and North America collected as part of TEST and the in vitro activity of tigecycline.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To describe antimicrobial susceptibility among bacterial isolates associated with hospital infections collected from 266 centres in Asia/Pacific Rim (n = 1,947), North America (n = 24,283), Latin America (n = 1,957) and Europe (n = 8,796). METHODS: Isolates were collected from blood, respiratory tract, urine, skin, wound, body fluids and other defined sources between January 2004 and August 2006. Only one isolate per patient was accepted. In vitro MICs for the isolates were determined according to the CLSI (formerly NCCLS) guidelines. RESULTS: Key organisms collected were Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 2,902), Enterobacter spp. (n = 5,731), Escherichia coli (n = 6,504), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 4,916), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 5,128), Serratia marcescens (n = 2,313), Enterococcus faecalis (n = 2,701), Enterococcus faecium (n = 1,035) and Staphylococcus aureus (n = 5,753). Rates of methicillin resistance among S. aureus and of vancomycin resistance among enterococci were highest in North America (2,016/3,809, 52.9% and 571/2,544, 22.4%, respectively) and lowest in Europe (337/1,340, 25.1% and 36/916, 3.9%, respectively). Tigecycline was the only antimicrobial to maintain activity against all Gram-positive isolates (MIC(90) values of <or=0.25 mg/L). Overall, tigecycline and imipenem were the most active (>93% susceptibility in all regions) antimicrobials against the Gram-negative species, except for A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa. Piperacillin/tazobactam and amikacin were the most active against P. aeruginosa. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producers among K. pneumoniae occurred most frequently in Latin America (124/282, 44.0%). CONCLUSIONS: Tigecycline is a novel broad-spectrum antimicrobial that is active against the common organisms associated with infections.
TI  - Effects of tetracycline on antibiotic resistance and removal of fecal indicator bacteria in aerated and unaerated leachfield mesocosms.
AB  - Antibiotics can be present in low concentrations in domestic wastewater, but little is known about their effect on bacteria in onsite wastewater treatment systems. Mesocosms, consisting of soil-filled lysimeters representing the leachfield of a septic system under aerated (AIR) and unaerated (LEACH) conditions, were used to study the effects of tetracycline addition (5 mg L(-1)) to septic tank effluent on tetracycline resistance in the fecal indicator bacteria Escherichia coli and fecal streptococci, and on their removal. The mesocosms were dosed with antibiotic for 10 days, and effects monitored for 52 days. The fraction of resistant bacteria in mesocosm drainage water relative to that in septic tank effluent, GammaRes, for E. coli ranged from 0 to 0.66 in the AIR treatment and from 0 to 3.32 in the LEACH treatment. For fecal streptococci, GammaRes ranged from 0 to 0.41 and from 0.63 to 1.06 in the AIR and LEACH treatments, respectively. No significant differences in antibiotic resistance of fecal indicator bacteria were observed among sampling dates in soil or water from either treatment. Tetracycline had no significant effect on removal of fecal indicator bacteria, which ranged from 99.9 to 100% for E. coli and from 95.9 to 100% for fecal streptococci. Our results suggest that short-term addition of tetracycline at environmentally-relevant concentrations is likely to have minimal consequences on pathogen removal from wastewater and development of antibiotic resistance among pathogenic bacteria in leachfield soil.
TI  - A novel bacteriocin-like substance produced by Enterococcus faecium 3587.
AB  - Secretion of a novel bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance from Enterococcus faecium 3587 is described herein for the first time. Whereas some bacteriocins receive their denomination based on the species or genus name of the producer microorganism, the newly discovered bacteriocin-like substance was named "enterocin 3587." The growth characteristics of the producer strain, as well as the type of production and the primary characteristic of the peptide, were investigated. It was found by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis that the molecule possesses a molecular weight <6.5 kDa; its secretion is growth-phase dependent; and it shows activities only against other closely related enterococci but not against other Gram-positive bacteria, such as L. innocua, S. aureus 209, and Lactobacillus delbrueckii B2, nor against some Gram-negative species, such as Escherichia coli HB101.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of unsaturated fatty acid auxotrophs of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Unsaturated fatty acid (UFA) biosynthesis is essential for the maintenance of membrane structure and function in many groups of anaerobic bacteria. Like Escherichia coli, the human pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae produces straight-chain saturated fatty acids (SFA) and monounsaturated fatty acids. In E. coli UFA synthesis requires the action of two gene products, the essential isomerase/dehydratase encoded by fabA and an elongation condensing enzyme encoded by fabB. S. pneumoniae lacks both genes and instead employs a single enzyme with only an isomerase function encoded by the fabM gene. In this paper we report the construction and characterization of an S. pneumoniae 708 fabM mutant. This mutant failed to grow in complex medium, and the defect was overcome by addition of UFAs to the growth medium. S. pneumoniae fabM mutants did not produce detectable levels of monounsaturated fatty acids as determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and thin-layer chromatography analysis of the radiolabeled phospholipids. We also demonstrate that a fabM null mutant of the cariogenic organism Streptococcus mutants is a UFA auxotroph, indicating that FabM is the only enzyme involved in the control of membrane fluidity in streptococci. Finally we report that the fabN gene of Enterococcus faecalis, coding for a dehydratase/isomerase, complements the growth of S. pneumoniae fabM mutants. Taken together, these results suggest that FabM is a potential target for chemotherapeutic agents against streptococci and that S. pneumoniae UFA auxotrophs could help identify novel genes encoding enzymes involved in UFA biosynthesis.
TI  - The structures and antibacterial properties of nano-SiO2 supported silver/zinc-silver materials.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were to investigate the structures and antibacterial properties of two kinds of sterilizing nano-SiO(2) specimens. METHODS: The specimens were synthesized by adsorption methodology. One of them was synthesized by adsorbing silver cation onto nano-SiO(2) carrier (silver-loading nano-SiO(2) specimen (SLS)), and the other one by co-adsorbing zinc and silver cations onto the same kind of carrier (zinc-silver-loading nano-SiO(2) specimen (SLZS)). Chemical compositions of these specimens were estimated. The structure and morphology of the specimens were determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). Also, the antibacterial properties of the specimens were examined. RESULTS: The amount of silver loaded in SLZS was approximate to that of SLS. Consequently, it can be proved that the amount of nano-SiO(2) adsorbed silver cation did not change with the addition of zinc cation. The obvious differences were not observed among the XRD patterns for each specimen. So it was possible to confirm no formation of new phase(s) after Ag(+)/Zn(2+) absorption. The loaded silver and zinc existed as nano-particles, as observed by HRTEM. Antibacterial properties of SLS and SLZS were excellent against Escherichia coli and S. faecalis. The antibacterial effect of the same antibacterial agent against E. coli or S. faecalis was different. In addition, the antibacterial effect of SLZS was better than that of SLS. SIGNIFICANCE: These results suggested SLS and SLZS can be effectively incorporated in dental resin-based materials to provide antibacterial activity against bacteria.
TI  - [Species-identification and antimicrobial susceptibility tests by the fully automated RAISUS using an early-harvested cell suspension].
AB  - We evaluated the usefulness of an early-harvested bacterial cell suspension to the fully automated RAISUS (Nissui Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd., Tokyo) to provide the results of species-identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testings within a day after overnight-incubation of the primary cultures. A single, well-separated colony appeared on the primary culture plate was transferred onto a blood agar or chocolate agar plates, then incubated for 3 to 6 hours. The cell suspension to the RAISUS was properly prepared to the McFarland 0.5 turbidity from the early-harvested bacterial cells. When the five ATCC reference strains, consisting of Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Streptococcus pneumoniae ATCC 49619, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, were repeatedly tested for the species-identification, all the identification results were acceptable. Antimicrobial susceptibility tests were evaluated with the above five strains and Haemophilus influenzae ATCC 49247. The results obtained indicated that the most susceptibility test results were comparable to those MICs obtained by the standard test procedure, but some strains, in particular, H. influenzae and P. aeruginosa gave significantly discrepant MICs for certain antimicrobial agents. The significant discrepancy in MIC determinations regarded the difference of viable cell concentrations in the cell suspension prepared respectively. Through the analysis of laboratory workflow, it became to apparent that 18S to 20S of the tests were completed by 5:00 p.m., and it required to wait until 3:00 a.m. to complete 90S of the tests. With these results, the early-harvested bacterial cell suspension is applicable to species-identification by RAISUS, but it is necessary to adjust viable cell concentrations to antimicrobial susceptibility test. Also, it is urgent to reconstitute a daily workflow to improve the rapidity of RAISUS test function.
TI  - Bacteria induce CTGF and CYR61 expression in epithelial cells in a lysophosphatidic acid receptor-dependent manner.
AB  - Cysteine-rich protein 61 (Cyr61/CCN1) and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF/CCN2) are members of the CCN (CYR61, CTGF, nephroblastoma overexpressed gene) family and exert pleiotropic functions such as regulation of adhesion, migration, extracellular matrix deposition, or cell differentiation, and play an important role in wound healing. This study focused on the nature of the so far unknown CTGF and CYR61 mRNA expression of epithelial cells after infection with bacteria. We demonstrate that infection of epithelial cells with attenuated Yersinia enterocolitica lacking the virulence plasmid pYV leads to the expression of CYR61 and CTGF. Virulent Y. enterocolitica bearing the pYV virulence plasmid suppressed the mRNA expression of these genes. Yersinia-mediated inhibition of CTGF and CYR61 mRNA expression is partially mediated by the cysteine protease YopT. Further characterization of the Yersinia factors, which trigger CTGF and CYR61 mRNA expression, demonstrated that these factors were secreted and could be enriched in lipid extracts. Beside Yersinia, several other bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, or Staphylococcus aureus, as well as supernatants of these bacteria induced CTGF and CYR61 expression. Blocking experiments with the lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) receptor-specific inhibitor Ki16425 suggest a general involvement of LPA receptors in bacteria-triggered CTGF and CYR61 expression. These data suggest that LPA receptor-dependent expression of CTGF and CYR61 represents a common host response after interaction with bacteria.
TI  - Dual-association of gnotobiotic IL-10-/- mice with 2 nonpathogenic commensal bacteria induces aggressive pancolitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Monoassociating gnotobiotic IL-10-deficient (-/-) mice with either nonpathogenic Enterococcus faecalis or a nonpathogenic Escherichia coli strain induces T-cell-mediated colitis with different kinetics and anatomical location (E. faecalis: late onset, distal colonic; E. coli: early onset, cecal). HYPOTHESIS: E. faecalis and E. coli act in an additive manner to induce more aggressive colitis than disease induced by each bacterial species independently. METHODS: Germ-free (GF) inbred 129S6/SvEv IL-10-/- and wildtype (WT) mice inoculated with nonpathogenic E. faecalis and/or E. coli were killed 3-7 weeks later. Colonic segments were scored histologically for inflammation (0 to 4) or incubated in media overnight to measure spontaneous IL-12/IL-23p40 secretion. Bacterial species were quantified by serial dilution and plated on culture media. Mesenteric lymph node (MLN) CD4(+) cells were stimulated with antigen-presenting cells pulsed with bacterial lysate (E. faecalis, E. coli, Bacteroides vulgatus) or KLH (unrelated antigen control). IFN-gamma and IL-17 levels were measured in the supernatants. RESULTS: Dual-associated IL-10-/- (but not WT) mice developed mild-to-moderate pancolitis by 3 weeks that progressed to severe distal colonic-predominant pancolitis with reactive atypia and duodenal inflammation by 7 weeks. NF-kappaB was activated in the duodenum and colon in dual-associated IL-10-/- x NF-kappaB(EGFP) mice. The aggressiveness of intestinal inflammation and the degree of antigen-specific CD4(+) cell activation were greater in dual- versus monoassociated IL-10-/- mice. CONCLUSION: Two commensal bacteria that individually induce phenotypically distinct colitis in gnotobiotic IL-10-/- mice act additively to induce aggressive pancolitis and duodenal inflammation.
TI  - Development of a surgical site infection (SSI) surveillance system, calculation of SSI rates and specification of important factors affecting SSI in a digestive organ surgical department.
AB  - We have developed an original system to conduct surgical site infection (SSI) surveillance. This system accumulates SSI surveillance information based on the National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance (NNIS) System and the Japanese Nosocomial Infections Surveillance (JNIS) System. The features of this system are as follows: easy input of data, high generality, data accuracy, SSI rate by operative procedure and risk index category (RIC) can be promptly calculated and compared with the current NNIS SSI rate, and the SSI rates and accumulated data can be exported electronically. Using this system, we monitored 798 patients in 24 operative procedure categories in the Digestive Organs Surgery Department of Mazda Hospital, Mazda Motor Corporation, from January 2004 through December 2005. The total number and rate of SSI were 47 and 5.89%, respectively. The SSI rates of 777 patients were calculated based on 15 operative procedure categories and Risk Index Categories (RIC). The highest SSI rate was observed in the rectum surgery of RIC 1 (30%), followed by the colon surgery of RIC3 (28.57%). About 30% of the isolated infecting bacteria were Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli. Using quantification theory type 2, the American Society of Anesthesiology score (4.531), volume of hemorrhage under operation (3.075), wound classification (1.76), operation time (1.352), and history of diabetes (0.989) increased to higher ranks as factors for SSI. Therefore, we evaluated this system as a useful tool in safety control for operative procedures.
TI  - [Effects of probiotics on pathogenic mycobacteria].
AB  - A procedure has been developed to study the antagonistic effect of probitics on pathogenic Mycobacterium tuberculosis, by employing the cultural filtrates obtained after joint incubation of a probiotic and an antagonistic strain in the liquid nutrient medium. It has been shown that two probiotics actively elaborate bactericidal agents that suppress the growth of pathogenic mycobacteria and reduce the number of colony-forming units in the solid egg culture medium by 2-17 times.
TI  - QSAR studies on benzoylaminobenzoic acid derivatives as inhibitors of beta-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthase III.
AB  - Fatty acid biosynthesis is essential for most of the bacterial survival. Components of this biosynthetic pathway have been identified as attractive targets for the development of new antibacterial agents. FabH, beta-ketoacyl-ACP synthase III, is a attractive target since it is central to the initiation of fatty acid biosynthesis. Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) studies have been carried out on a series of benzoylaminobenzoic acid derivatives as potent inhibitors of FabH and antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Neisseria meningitidis and Escherichia coli, which demonstrate FabH inhibitory activity in cell free and whole cell system. The QSAR studies revealed that inhibitory activity increases with increase in hydrophobicity, molar refractivity, aromaticity, and presence of OH group (on x position of the nucleus). On the other side presence of hetero-atoms like N, O, or S at R(1) position of the nucleus decreases the inhibitory activity. The comparison of QSAR between the FabH inhibitory activity and antibacterial activity against S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, E. faecalis, N. meningitidis also demonstrates that the hydrophobicity, aromaticity and presence of OH group (on x position of the nucleus) are conducive for the inhibitory activity.
TI  - Activity of meropenem as serine carbapenemases evolve in US Medical Centers: monitoring report from the MYSTIC Program (2006).
AB  - The Meropenem Yearly Susceptibility Test Information Collection (MYSTIC) Surveillance Program was designed to monitor the antimicrobial potency and spectrum of meropenem, and selected broad-spectrum comparison agents against pathogens from hospitalized patients. In the 2006 (year 8 of the study) United States sample, a total of 2841 isolates (94.7% compliance) including 641 Escherichia coli, 619 Klebsiella spp., 606 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 456 oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, 300 streptococci, 149 Enterococcus faecalis, and 70 Gram-positive anaerobic organisms were tested by reference broth microdilution or agar dilution susceptibility methods. The carbapenems, especially meropenem, consistently demonstrated the lowest resistance rates against Enterobacteriaceae strains, and the fluoroquinolones had the highest and increasing resistance rates. The presence of qnr-mediated fluoroquinolone resistance was investigated using polymerase chain reaction methods but was only observed at very low levels (2.1%) and was not clonally associated. Confirmed extended-spectrum beta-lactamase rates for E. coli and Klebsiella spp. were only 4.8% and 5.0%, respectively, with mobile AmpC (CMY-2 and FOX-5) enzymes shown in 13 additional Enterobacteriaceae isolates. Clonally related KPC-type serine carbapenemase production (57 strains, 9.5%) was observed at a rate 2-fold greater than the prior year among Klebsiella spp. isolates, primarily from 1 geographic region (Middle Atlantic States). These MYSTIC Program (2006) results demonstrate the continued need to monitor the carbapenem class potency and spectrum of activity against Enterobacteriaceae as well as P. aeruginosa because of the documented presence of serine carbapenemases and rare incidence of metallo-beta-lactamases that may further compromise their activity and that of other beta-lactam agents.
TI  - Intrathecal baclofen does not inhibit the growth of different bacterial species and Candida albicans.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The antimicrobial activity of intrathecal baclofen was investigated.  Several different microorganisms were used: Staphylococcus aureus (beta-lactamase-positive and beta-lactamase-negative strains); S epidermidis; Enterococcus faecalis; Klebsiella pneumoniae; Escherichia coli; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; and Candida albicans. METHODS: Three experimental approaches were used to assess baclofen antimicrobial activity: (1) determination of the MIC; (2) determination of the MBC; and (3) kinetic time-kill assay. Experiments were performed according to current methods of the NCCLS. RESULTS: As compared with control organisms exposed to physiologic saline, organisms exposed to baclofen over a 10-day period failed to reduce the number of viable cells by at least 3 log(10), as requested by NCCLS criteria. CONCLUSIONS: Because the viability of the investigated organisms was not reduced over that of microbial suspensions exposed to physiologic saline, we conclude that intrathecal baclofen has no measurable activity against different bacterial species and C albicans.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance pattern in uropathogens.
AB  - Uropathogenic strains from inpatient and outpatient departments were studied from April 1997 to March 1999 for their susceptibility profiles. The various isolates were Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Acinetobacter baumanii and Enterococcus faecalis. Antibiotic susceptibility pattern of these isolates revealed that for outpatients, first generation cephalosporins, nitrofurantoin, norfloxacin/ciprofloxacin were effective for treatment of urinary tract infection but for inpatients, parenteral therapy with newer aminoglycosides and third generation cephalosporins need to be advocated as the organisms for nosocomial UTI exhibit a high degree of drug resistance. Trimethoprim and sulphamethoxazole combination was not found to be effective for the treatment of urinary tract infections as all the uropathogens from inpatients and outpatients showed high degree of resistance to co-trimoxazole. Culture and sensitivity of the isolates from urine samples should be done as a routine before advocating the therapy.
TI  - Efficacy of a novel biofilter in hatchery sanitation: I. Removal of airborne bacteria, dust and endotoxin.
AB  - A novel biofilter containing organic, bentonite and halloysite media was applied  for elimination of microbial pollutants from the air of an industrial hatchery. The concentrations of total mesophilic bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria, thermophilic actinomycetes, dust and bacterial endotoxin were determined in the air of hatchery during 2 months before installation of the biofilter, and during 6 months after installation of the biofilter, at the inlet and outlet ducts from each medium. Before installation of the biofilter, the concentrations of total mesophilic bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria, thermophilic actinomycetes, dust and endotoxin in the air were within the ranges of 0.97-131.2x10(3) cfu/m3, 0.0-34.4x10(3) cfu/m3, 0.0-0.02x10(3) cfu/m3, 0.37-4.53 mg/m3, and 50.9-520,450.4 ng/m3, respectively. Enterococcus faecalis and Gram-negative bacteria (Acinetobacter spp., Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, and other species) prevailed among bacterial species recovered from the air of the hatchery. A total of 56 species or genera of bacteria were identified in the air samples taken in the examined hatchery; of these, 11, 11 and 6 species or genera respectively were reported as having allergenic, immunotoxic and/or infectious properties The concentrations of total mesophilic bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria, Enterococcus faecalis and endotoxin found at the inlet duct of the biofilter after its installation were significantly smaller compared to those recorded before its installation (p<0.05). The concentrations of Gram-negative bacteria, Enterococcus faecalis and dust found at the outlet ducts of biofilter after its installation were significantly smaller compared to those recorded at the inlet duct of the biofilter (p<0.01). The concentrations of total meso-philic bacteria were also smaller at the outlet ducts of the biofilter compared to that at the inlet duct; however, the difference was not significant because of the massive growth of Streptomyces species in the biofilter's media which contaminated the outcoming air. In conclusion, the applied biofilter proved to be effective in the elimination of potentially pathogenic bacteria, dust and endotoxin from the air of the hatchery. The efficacy of the biofilter could be improved by the inhibition of the Streptomyces growth in the media of the biofilter.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of silver-containing dressings on wound microorganisms using an in vitro biofilm model.
AB  - Antimicrobial dressings such as those containing silver are now being used widely to control wound bioburden, and tests to demonstrate their efficacy predominantly involve in vitro models using free-living or planktonic bacteria. In this present study a wide range of antibiotic-sensitive and resistant bacteria were tested in their quasi-sessile state using a standard agar assay and a second method used a poloxamer gel (true biofilm state - poloxamer encourages microorganisms to exhibit a more clinically relevant biofilm phenotype) technique. The antimicrobial activity of two silver dressings, a silver-containing Hydrofiber (SCH) dressing and a nanocrystalline silver-containing dressing (NCS), were evaluated on a variety of microorganisms, using a zone-of-inhibition (ZOI) test. When grown on agar (presenting a quasi-sessile state of each organism), the antibiotic-susceptible microorganisms were generally more susceptible to the SCH dressing compared with the NCS. ZOIs associated with SCH dressing ranged between 5.7 and 17.5 mm; those for the NCS against the same group of organisms ranged between 1.9 and 8.6 mm. When grown on poloxamer gel, (presenting the biofilm state of each organism) the same group of microorganisms were less susceptible to both dressings. The SCH dressing was most effective against strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans and Staphylococcus aureus (ZOI range: 2.6-6 mm); the NCS was most effective against strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli (i.e. ZOI range: 1-2.8 mm). Similarly to the antibiotic-susceptible microorganisms, nine of ten antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains when grown on agar were more susceptible to the SCH dressing compared with the NCS. Although the microorganisms tested were universally less susceptible to the silver dressings when in their biofilm state, in the majority of cases, the SCH dressing demonstrated greater biofilm-inhibiting activity than the NCS.
TI  - Comparative evaluation of silver-containing antimicrobial dressings and drugs.
AB  - Wound dressings containing silver as antimicrobial agents are available in various forms and formulations; however, little is understood concerning their comparative efficacy as antimicrobial agents. Eight commercially available silver-containing dressings, Acticoat 7, Acticoat Moisture Control, Acticoat Absorbent, Silvercel, Aquacel Ag, Contreet F, Urgotol SSD and Actisorb, were tested to determine their comparative antimicrobial effectiveness in vitro and compared against three commercially available topical antimicrobial creams, a non treatment control, and a topical silver-containing antimicrobial gel, Silvasorb. Zone of inhibition and quantitative testing was performed by standard methods using Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus. Results showed all silver dressings and topical antimicrobials displayed antimicrobial activity. Silver-containing dressings with the highest concentrations of silver exhibited the strongest bacterial inhibitive properties. Concreet F and the Acticoat dressings tended to have greater antimicrobial activity than did the others. Topical antimicrobial creams, including silver sulfadiazine, Sulfamylon and gentamicin sulfate, and the topical antimicrobial gel Silvasorb exhibited superior bacterial inhibition and bactericidal properties, essentially eliminating all bacterial growth at 24 hours. Silver-containing dressings are likely to provide a barrier to and treatment for infection; however, their bactericidal and bacteriostatic properties are inferior to commonly used topical antimicrobial agents.
TI  - [The analysis of the uterine cervix biocenosis in pregnant women].
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Infections of the vagina and the uterine cervix are some of the most  frequently diagnosed and treated complications during pregnancy. AIMS: The aim of the study was to carry out biocenosis of the uterine cervix among pregnant women and the assessment of the resistance of the previously isolated types of bacteria to antibiotics. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study was done in a group of 244 pregnant women, aged from 17 to 43, hospitalized and treated for various reasons in the Department of Pathology of Pregnancy at Medical University in Lodz. The biocenosis of the uterine cervix and the results of microbiological bacterial culture have been analyzed and the sensitivity of bacterial flora on the applied antibiotics has been assessed. RESULTS: Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus epidermidis were the most frequent bacteria found in the smear from the uterine cervix. Negative culture was obtained in 2% of the pregnant women. The most frequently observed resistance to antibiotics manifested itself in case of amoxicillin, ampicillin, penicillin, erythromycin, clarithromycin and azithromycin. The bacteria showed least resistance to cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones. Staphylococcus epidermidis showed the highest resistance to antibiotics in general. CONCLUSIONS: In cases of bacterial vaginal infections, with unknown sensitivity to bacteria, treatment the use of cephalosporins is highly recommended.
TI  - In vitro activity of para-guanidinoethylcalix[4]arene against susceptible and antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Emergence of multidrug-resistant bacteria has encouraged vigorous efforts to develop antimicrobial agents with new mechanisms of action. In this study, the in vitro antibacterial activity of para-guanidinoethylcalix[4]arene was evaluated and compared with that of its constitutive monomer, para-guanidinoethylphenol. Hexamidine, a widely used antiseptic, and synthalin A, an old antidiabetic and anti-trypanosomal compound, were chosen as references. METHODS: MIC and MBC were determined for five reference strains (Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 and ATCC 29213, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853), as well as five antibiotic-resistant clinical isolates. Toxicity on MRC-5 and HaCaT eukaryotic cell lines was also evaluated by MTT and Neutral Red assays. RESULTS: No antibacterial activity was observed for para-guanidinoethylphenol (MIC >or= 512 mg/L) and synthalin A (MIC >or= 64 mg/L). Conversely, para-guanidinoethylcalix[4]arene and hexamidine: (i) showed a broad antibacterial spectrum, both on Gram-positive and on Gram-negative bacteria (MIC = 4 mg/L against E. coli and 8 mg/L against S. aureus for para-guanidinoethylcalix[4]arene), to a lesser degree against E. faecalis and P. aeruginosa (MIC = 32 mg/L); (ii) were bacteriostatic (MBC >or= 256 mg/L); and (iii) MICs and MBCs obtained for clinical isolates were similar to those obtained with reference strains. Both compounds, the monomer and the calixarene, showed no apparent cytotoxicity, whereas hexamidine and synthalin A had significant toxic effects that increased with time and concentration and in a range of 100-1000 times that for calixarene. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, results confirm para-guanidinoethylcalix[4]arene as a broad-spectrum new agent or an auxiliary in antimicrobial chemotherapy.
TI  - Role of a qnr-like gene in the intrinsic resistance of Enterococcus faecalis to fluoroquinolones.
AB  - Fluoroquinolones are poorly active against enterococci. Recently, plasmid-borne resistance to fluoroquinolones due to the qnr gene was reported in members of the Enterobacteriaceae family. The gene encodes a pentapeptide repeat protein that protects DNA gyrase from inhibition by fluoroquinolones. We have identified in the genome of Enterococcus faecalis V583 a qnr-like gene, named E. faecalis qnr (qnr(E. faecalis)), encoding a putative pentapeptide repeat protein that shares 25% identity with Qnr. To assess its potential role in the intrinsic resistance of E. faecalis to fluoroquinolones, qnr(E. faecalis) was inactivated in E. faecalis JH2-2 by insertion of the thermosensitive vector pG1KT. This strain was then complemented with qnr(E. faecalis) cloned in the multicopy plasmid pORI23. The effects of its overexpression were also studied. Inactivation of the qnr(E. faecalis) gene resulted in twofold decreases in the MICs of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. When the gene was complemented or overexpressed, MICs of fluoroquinolones increased four- to nine-fold, leading to MICs of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin equal to 32 mug/ml and 8 mug/ml, respectively. The E. faecalis Qnr (Qnr(E. faecalis)) protein was produced and purified. Qnr(E. faecalis) protein protected Escherichia coli DNA gyrase from inhibition by ofloxacin. The qnr(E. faecalis) gene was then introduced into E. coli DH10B, Staphylococcus aureus RN4220, and Lactococcus lactis IL-1419 to study its heterologous expression. MICs of the various fluoroquinolones tested increased 4- to 16-fold, showing that Qnr(E. faecalis) conferred resistance to fluoroquinolones in various bacterial backgrounds. Overexpression of qnr(E. faecalis) in enterococci or mobilization of the gene to other bacterial species may be anticipated as a possible new mechanism for fluoroquinolone resistance.
TI  - Antiviral and antimicrobial activities of three sesquiterpene lactones from Centaurea solstitialis L. ssp. solstitialis.
AB  - Three sesquiterpene lactones (centaurepensin = chlorohyssopifolin A, chlorojanerin and 13-acetyl solstitialin A) isolated from the aerial parts of Centaurea solstitialis L. ssp. solstitialis (Asteraceae) were investigated for antimicrobial and antiviral activities. For the antimicrobial activity assessment, both standard and isolated strains of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans and C. parapsilosis were employed by the microdilution method. Herpes simplex type-1, a DNA virus, and Parainfluenza, an RNA virus, were employed for the determination of the antiviral activity of these three sesquiterpene lactones using Vero cell lines. Ampicilline, ofloxocine, ketoconazole, fluconazole, acyclovir and oseltamivir were used as the reference drugs. 13-Acetyl solstitialin A displayed remarkable antibacterial activity against isolated strains of E. faecalis at 1 microg/ml concentration, which was close to the effective concentrations of ampicillin. The same compound also showed significant activity against the DNA virus, being as potent as the reference compound acyclovir at maximum and minimum concentrations of 16-<0.00006 microg/ml. This is the first report showing that 13-acetyl solstitialin A possesses significant antiviral activity.
TI  - The use of the erbium, chromium:yttrium-scandium-gallium-garnet laser in endodontic treatment: the results of an in vitro study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of the erbium, chromium:yttrium-scandium-gallium-garnet (Er,Cr:YSGG) laser has become accepted in the field of cavity preparation. The development of miniaturized and flexible fiber tips has allowed this device to be used in endodontics. The authors conducted an in vitro study to assess the effects of Er,Cr:YSGG laser irradiation on root canals. METHODS: The authors inoculated root canals with two bacteria, laser irradiated them at two power settings and subjected them to a quantitative microbiological evaluation. They used scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to assess morphological changes in endodontically processed and laser-irradiated root canal walls. They measured temperature increases on the root surface to determine possible thermal side effects. RESULTS: The bacteriological evaluation revealed a disinfecting effect in the root dentin samples that was dependent on the output power but not specific for the bacterial species investigated. SEM showed the removal of the smear layer from the root canal walls and the exposure of dentinal tubules. The temperature rise during irradiation was moderate when standardized power settings were used. CONCLUSIONS: The Er,Cr:YSGG laser can be used to eliminate bacteria in root canals. It also effectively removes smear layer and debris from the canal wall. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Practitioners can use the Er,Cr:YSGG laser to prepare root canals for endodontic therapy.
TI  - [Epidemiological profile of enterobacteria isolated from neutropenic patients].
AB  - Thirteen patients treated with gut decontamination were screened over a period of three years for digestive colonization and acquisition of resistant strains, in fact 297 strains had been isolated from 226 stool cultures within 120 enterobacteria and other species. Our study pointed out a betaLSE digestive colonization rate of 30.8% of the total enterobacteria isolated, these strains exhibit resistance of most beta-lactams especially against third generation cephalosporins. This analysis showed that these strains are endogen and specific for each patient, the common multiresistance resulted from the selective pressure of gut decontamination.
TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial activity of tert-butyl [1-benzyl-2[(4-aryl-2-thiazolyl)hydrazono]ethyl]carbamate derivatives.
AB  - The increasing clinical importance of drug-resistant fungal and bacterial pathogens has lent additional urgency to microbiological research and new antibacterial compound development. For this purpose, new tert-butyl[1-benzyl-2[(4-aryl-2-thiazolyl)hydrazono]ethyl]carbamate derivatives were synthesized and evaluated for antibacterial activity. The reaction of Boc-L-phenylalaninal with thiosemicarbazide gave the thiosemicarbazone which furnished the title compounds by reaction with phenacyl bromides. The newly synthesized compounds were screened for antibacterial activity and toxicity. While microdilution broth susceptibility assay was used for the antibacterial activity evaluation of the compounds against the strains E. coli (NRRL B-3704), M. luteus (NRRL B-4375), B. cereus (NRRL B-3711), P. aeruginosa (NRRL B-23), and S. fecalis (NRRL B-14617), the Artemia salina 96-well assay was used to determine cytotoxicities of the compounds. Observations obtained from the bioassays showed that some of the compounds are highly active against E. coli, M. luteus, and B. cereus when compared with the control agent and showed low toxicity.
TI  - A Drosophila ortholog of the human cylindromatosis tumor suppressor gene regulates triglyceride content and antibacterial defense.
AB  - The cylindromatosis (CYLD) gene is mutated in human tumors of skin appendages. It encodes a deubiquitylating enzyme (CYLD) that is a negative regulator of the NF-kappaB and JNK signaling pathways, in vitro. However, the tissue-specific function and regulation of CYLD in vivo are poorly understood. We established a genetically tractable animal model to initiate a systematic investigation of these issues by characterizing an ortholog of CYLD in Drosophila. Drosophila CYLD is broadly expressed during development and, in adult animals, is localized in the fat body, ovaries, testes, digestive tract and specific areas of the nervous system. We demonstrate that the protein product of Drosophila CYLD (CYLD), like its mammalian counterpart, is a deubiquitylating enzyme. Impairment of CYLD expression is associated with altered fat body morphology in adult flies, increased triglyceride levels and increased survival under starvation conditions. Furthermore, flies with compromised CYLD expression exhibited reduced resistance to bacterial infections. All mutant phenotypes described were reversible upon conditional expression of CYLD transgenes. Our results implicate CYLD in a broad range of functions associated with fat homeostasis and host defence in Drosophila.
TI  - Visible light inactivation of bacteria and fungi by modified titanium dioxide.
AB  - Visible light induced photocatalytic inactivation of bacteria (Escherichia coli,  Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis) and fungi (Candida albicans, Aspergillus niger) was tested. Carbon-doped titanium dioxide and TiO2 modified with platinum(IV) chloride complexes were used as suspension or immobilised at the surface of plastic plates. A biocidal effect was observed under visible light irradiation in the case of E. coli in the presence of both photocatalysts. The platinum(IV) modified titania exhibited a higher inactivation effect, also in the absence of light. The mechanism of visible light induced photoinactivation is briefly discussed. The observed detrimental effect of photocatalysts on various microorganism groups decreases in the order: E. coli > S. aureus approximately E. faecalis>>C. albicans approximately A. niger. This sequence results most probably from differences in cell wall or cell membrane structures in these microorganisms and is not related to the ability of catalase production.
TI  - In vitro activity of ceftaroline (PPI-0903M, T-91825) against bacteria with defined resistance mechanisms and phenotypes.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ceftaroline (PPI-0903M, T-91825) is a novel cephalosporin, administered as an N-phosphono prodrug. We investigated its in vitro activity and resistance selection potential. METHODS: MICs were determined by CLSI agar dilution, but with varied inocula. Mutant selection was investigated in single- and multi-step procedures. RESULTS: MICs for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) were 0.5-2 mg/L, compared with 0.12-0.25 mg/L for methicillin-susceptible S. aureus; corresponding values for coagulase-negative staphylococci were 0.25-2 and 0.06-0.12 mg/L, respectively. Even with 2% NaCl added, all MRSA were susceptible at 2 mg/L. MICs for Enterococcus faecalis were from 0.25 to 8 mg/L; E. faecium was resistant. MICs for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Morganella morganii and Proteeae without acquired resistance were 0.06-0.5 mg/L versus 0.12-1 mg/L for Enterobacter, Serratia and Citrobacter spp. and 2-8 mg/L for Acinetobacter spp. MICs rose to 1-2 mg/L for many Enterobacteriaceae with classical TEM beta-lactamases, and were much higher for those with extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs), hyperproduced AmpC or K1 enzymes. MICs for strains with classical TEM/SHV beta-lactamases rose if the inoculum was increased to 10(6) cfu/spot; this effect was even more marked for those with ESBLs. Resistance due to Class A beta-lactamases was reversed by clavulanate. Geometric mean MICs were 0.005, 0.05 and 0.09 mg/L for penicillin-susceptible, -intermediate and -resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae strains, respectively-lower than for any comparator beta-lactam. Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis were very susceptible, although with marginally raised MICs for beta-lactamase-positive Moraxella strains and for haemophili with chromosomal ampicillin resistance. Ceftaroline selected AmpC-derepressed Enterobacter mutants similarly to cefotaxime in single-step experiments; in multi-step procedures it selected ESBL variants of blaTEM in E. coli. Resistance selection was not seen with S. aureus, H. influenzae or pneumococci. CONCLUSIONS: Ceftaroline has impressive anti-MRSA and anti-pneumococcal activity. Slight lability to classical TEM and SHV beta-lactamases is exceptional for an oxyimino-cephalosporin, but was reversible with clavulanate, as was the greater resistance mediated by ESBLs. Resistance selection occurred with Enterobacteriaceae, not MRSA.
TI  - High-throughput synthesis and screening of cyclic peptide antibiotics.
AB  - Cyclic peptides are a rich source of biologically active compounds and are produced in nature by plants, bacteria, fungi, and lower sea animals. A high-throughput methodology has been developed for the combinatorial synthesis, screening, and identification of cyclic peptide natural product analogues with improved biological activities or useful new activities. The methodology was applied to generate a library of 1716 tyrocidine A analogues, which were screened for antibacterial activity in 96-well plates. The identity of the active peptides was determined by partial Edman degradation/mass spectrometry. This has resulted in the discovery of a series of tyrocidine analogues that have significantly improved therapeutic indices compared to the natural product. The availability of tyrocidine analogues with varying antibacterial activities has provided important insights into the structure-function relationship of tyrocidine A, which should help reveal its mechanism of action.
TI  - Comparison of the antibacterial activity of honey from different provenance against bacteria usually isolated from skin wounds.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of honey samples provided by apiarists and honey packers was tested against microorganisms usually isolated from skin wounds. The antibacterial activity was tested using the well-agar diffusion assay. The honey samples were tested without dilution, and at 75, 50, 30, and 10% (w/v) dilution. Most of the undiluted honey samples inhibited the growth of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Some honey samples provided by apiarists also inhibited the growth of S. aureus even at 50% dilution. Undiluted honey samples also inhibited the growth of Staphylococcus uberis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae, although to a lesser extent. No inhibition of Micrococcus luteus and Enterococcus faecalis growth was detected. The diameters of the inhibition zones generated by honey samples provided by apiarists were larger than those generated by honey samples provided by honey packers. This observation may be explained by considering the provenance of the honey samples.
TI  - Bactericidal and cytotoxic effects of chloramine-T on wound pathogens and human fibroblasts in vitro.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate cytotoxicity and bactericidal effects of chloramine-T. METHODS: In vitro study of various concentrations and exposure times to preparations containing human fibroblasts or 1.5 x 10 colony forming units per milliliter (CFU/mL) of 3 gram-positive bacteria-Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S aureus, and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis-and 2 gram-negative bacteria-Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa-with and without fetal bovine serum present. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Percentage reduction of bacterial growth and percentage of viable fibroblasts 48 hours after exposure. RESULTS: All gram-positive growth was reduced by 95% to 100%, regardless of dose, with or without serum. E coli (gram-negative; with/without serum) was reduced 94% to 100% at antiseptic concentrations of 300 and 400 ppm. At 200 ppm, E coli growth was fully inhibited without serum present and by 50% with serum. P aeruginosa (gram-negative) was not significantly affected under any conditions. At 100 and 200 ppm, cell viability remained greater than 90% under all experimental conditions. A 300-ppm, 3-minute exposure to chloramine-T resulted in cell viability of up to 70%, with longer exposures producing lower viabilities. Serum did not affect cell viability in any condition. CONCLUSIONS: In vitro, chloramine-T at 200 ppm for 5 to 20 minutes was effective against 3 virulent gram-positive bacteria without fibroblast damage. At 300 ppm and 3 and 5 minutes, 30% of fibroblasts were damaged and 95% to 100 % of E coli were inhibited, respectively.
TI  - Urinary tract infections in Brescia, Italy: etiology of uropathogens and antimicrobial resistance of common uropathogens.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Urinary tract infections are associated with substantial morbidity and recurrent infections. Antibiotic therapy is generally initiated empirically because early treatment decreases the rate of morbidity resulting from UTI. Unfortunately, antibiotic resistance has become an increasingly pressing problem in many countries. In this study, the resistance patterns of urinary isolates to commonly used antimicrobials were determined in order to evaluate the options for empirical antibiotic therapy of UTI in out- and in- patients. MATERIAL/METHODS: A retrospective study was carried out on urine samples examined in this laboratory in 2002-2005. The isolates were divided into the following three groups: isolates from hospital inpatients, isolates from community outpatients, and isolates from catheterized patients. RESULTS: Escherichia coli was the most common etiologic agent isolated, followed by Enterococcus faecalis and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Over the four-year period, a decrease in the isolation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and a parallel increase in Candida spp. in hospitalized patients were observed. Against Gram-positive isolates, enterococci in particular, ampicillin and glycopeptides demonstrated the best, most consistent activity. Among Escherichia coli isolates, nitrofurantoin, cephalosporins, and penicillin/betalactams were the best options for therapeutic treatment because of the presence of a rate of resistance to cotrimoxazole and fluoroquinolones of over 10%, while the most active drug against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was piperacillin/tazobactam. CONCLUSIONS: Region-specific surveillance studies provide additional information about the type of pathogens causing UTIs and their antimicrobial susceptibility patterns. Therefore, these data can serve as a basis to develop national country-specific guidelines for the empirical treatment of UTIs.
TI  - [Biological hazards in air at municipal waste landfills].
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to assess the microbiological air quality at the selected municipal waste landfills. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was conducted during the summer at two municipal landfills. Air samples were collected on agar plates. The evaluation was based on the concentration levels of airborne bacteria and fungi and the identification of isolated strains. RESULTS: The total number of bacteria and fungi did not exceed the level of 10(3) cfu/m3. The highest concentrations of bacteria in air were observed during unloading, disposing and compacting of municipal wastes (landfill 1 - 6,1 x 10(3) cfu/ml, landfill 2 - 5,4 x 10(2) cfu/m3). The highest concentrations of fungi in air were observed at filled up parts of the landfills (landfill 1 - 4,8 x 10(2) cfu/m3, landfill 2 - 1,2 x 10(3) cfu/m3). The qualitative analysis of the air samples indicated the presence of 21 bacterial and fungi. Among of them bacteria Enterococcus faecalis, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis and fungi Aspergillus fumigatus, Candida albicans are classified as harmful biological agents. CONCLUSIONS: The total number of bacteria and fungi in air samples collected at the selected municipal waste landfills did not exceed the reference values. The concentration levels of bioaerosols are diversified according to the size of the landfill, the total number of accumulated wastes and the level of area usage. It is suggested using by municipal waste workers personal protective equipment, especially for respiratory airways and skin and also keeping the rules of individual hygiene.
TI  - Mathematical model of manganese ion catalyzed microwave deactivation of Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli.
AB  - Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli survival was investigated using microwave irradiation (power 130 W) both in a water control and in the presence of a 1 microM manganese ion solution. Measured survival dependencies had "bell" shape form with maximum bacterial viability between 1-2 min of microwave heating. Additional heating revealed bacteria survival decreasing up to 3 min of microwave heating when viability became insignificantly small. The total deactivation time of bacteria in the presence of manganese ions was significantly smaller then that of bacteria irradiated in the microwave without manganese ions present (4-5 min). One possible explanation for the rapid reduction of bacterial survival during microwave irradiation in the presence of manganese ions is that increasing manganese ion penetration into bacteria along with microwave irradiation related to an increase of kinetic energy of ions, and damaging of bacteria by metal ions. The proposed mathematical model for microwave heating took into account "growth" and "death" factors of bacteria. It assumes that rates of bacterial growth and decay are linear functions of water temperature, and rate of bacterial decay that relates with metal concentration into water is also linear, which influenced the differential equation for the dependence between number of survival bacteria and temperature water. By using proportionality between the time of microwave heating and water temperature we derived the differential equation, between bacterial viability and time of microwave irradiation which was used as mathematical model for microwave heating in the presence of metal ions. This model had forms of second-degree polynomial functions. We received good relationships (with coefficient of correlation 0.92-0.99) between proposed mathematical model and experimental data for all bacterial deactivation.
TI  - Mathematical models for conventional and microwave thermal deactivation of Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli.
AB  - Temperature dependencies of survival fecal coliforms such as Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli in water were investigated between 25-65 degrees C. Measured dependencies had "bell" shaped form with maximum bacterial viability at 35-45 degrees C. The rates of growth and decay of bacterial viability depend on specific forms of bacteria. At temperatures of 60-65 degrees C the number of viable bacteria decreased in one hundred times in comparison with the maximum value. Similar "bell" shape forms were found for dependencies between bacterial viability and time of microwave (dielectric) heating of water. The dependencies had maximum value at 1-2 min of microwave heating. Then, the number of viable bacteria decreased, and at 4-5 min of microwave heating, became insignificantly small. The proposed mathematical models for conventional and microwave heating took into account "growth" and "death" factors of bacteria, and had forms of second degree polynomial functions. The results showed good relationships (with coefficient correlation 0.84-0.99) between the proposed mathematical models and experimental data for both conventional and microwave heating.
TI  - In vivo functional analyses of the type II acyl carrier proteins of fatty acid biosynthesis.
AB  - Acyl carrier protein (ACP) is a key component of the fatty acid synthesis pathways of both type I and type II synthesis systems. A large number of structure-function studies of various type II ACPs have been reported, but all are in vitro studies that assayed function or interaction of mutant ACPs with various enzymes of fatty acid synthesis or transfer. Hence in these studies functional properties of various mutant ACPs were assayed with only a subset of the many ACP-interacting proteins, which may not give an accurate overall view of the function of these proteins in vivo. This is especially so because Escherichia coli ACP has been reported to interact with several proteins that have no known roles in lipid metabolism. We therefore tested a large number of mutant derivatives of E. coli ACP carrying single amino acid substitutions for their abilities to restore growth to an E. coli strain carrying a temperature-sensitive mutation in acpP, the gene that encodes ACP. Many of these mutant proteins had previously been tested in vitro thus providing data for comparison with our results. We found that several mutant ACPs containing substitutions of ACP residues reported previously to be required for ACP function in vitro support normal growth of the acpP mutant strain. However, several mutant proteins reported to be severely defective in vitro failed to support growth of the acpP strain in vivo (or supported only weak growth). A collection of ACPs from diverse bacteria and from three eukaryotic organelles was also tested. All of the bacterial ACPs tested restored growth to the E. coli acpP mutant strain except those from two related bacteria, Enterococcus faecalis and Lactococcus lactis. Only one of the three eukaryotic organellar ACPs allowed growth. Strikingly the ACP is that of the apicoplast of Plasmodium falciparum (the protozoan that causes malaria). The fact that an ACP from a such diverse organism can replace AcpP function in E. coli suggests that some of the protein-protein interactions detected for AcpP may be not be essential for growth of E. coli.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of seven hypericum entities from central Italy.
AB  - Methanol-acetone extracts from aerial parts of seven entities of the genus Hypericum [H. perforatum L. subsp. perforatum, H. perforatum L. subsp. veronense (Schrank) Ces., H. montanum L., H. hyssopifolium Chaix, H. hirsutum L., H. hircinum L. subsp. majus (Aiton) N. Robson, H. tetrapterum Fr.] growing in the Appennino Umbro-Marchigiano (central Italy) were tested in vitro for their antimicrobial activity against two Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis), two Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and the yeast Candida albicans, by the Kirby-Bauer agar diffusion method. The two H. perforatum subspecies were particularly active against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, supporting the use of these plants in the traditional medicine of central Italy to treat wounds, skin and infectious diseases. However significant values of inhibition were given also by H. hirsutum against S. aureus and P. aeruginosa, and by H. hyssopifolium, H. hircinum subsp. majus and H. tetrapterum against C. albicans. These results suggest that hypericin and hyperforin are the main components responsible for antimicrobial activity, but not the only ones, as other extracts, showing a low level of these compounds, possess evident activity. Isolation of pure compounds from the most active extracts is in progress.
TI  - Differential inflammatory mediator response in vitro from murine macrophages to lactobacilli and pathogenic intestinal bacteria.
AB  - Chronic active colitis (including inflammatory bowel disease - IBD) is maintained by a variety of pro-inflammatory mediators. Certain intestinal bacterial strains may induce colitis, whereas some strains (e.g. Lactobacillus spp.) show a protective effect in colitis owing to their anti-inflammatory activity. In this study, we have examined the production of selected inflammatory cytokines, reactive oxygen species (ROS), nitric oxide (NO) and the expression of haeme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) by murine peritoneal macrophages stimulated in vitro by the intestinal bacterial strains, isolated from mice with colitis. Lactobacillus strains (Lactobacillus reuteri, L. johnsonii, L. animalis/murinus) and two potentially pathogenic bacteria (Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis) induced the production of substantial amounts of cytokines with a strain specific profile. Despite some interstrain differences, all lactobacilli induced production of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10(high), IL-6(low), IL-12p70(low)). Conversely, E. faecalis and E. coli induced the production of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-12p70), the cytokines essential for chronic IBD. Macrophages released comparably substantial amounts of ROS in response to all Lactobacillus strains tested, while E. coli and E. faecalis ability to induce generation of ROS was negligible. In contrast to ROS, the production of NO/NO(2) (-) by macrophages activated with all bacterial strains tested was similar. Moreover, for the first time, it has been shown that intestinal bacteria differed in their ability to induce expression of HO-1, a stress-inducible enzyme with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. The beneficial immunoregulatory properties of candidate probiotic bacteria for the treatment of IBD are discussed.
TI  - Resistance to disinfectants in epidemiologically defined clinical isolates of Acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  - Decreased susceptibility to biocides may contribute to epidemic spread of Acinetobacter baumannii in the hospital. This study was conducted to evaluate the susceptibility of different clinical A. baumannii strains to disinfectants. Twenty A. baumannii strains were examined, ten of which were outbreak-related and ten that were sporadic. Clinical isolates were selected on the basis of demonstrating a unique pulsed-field gel electrophoresis pattern. The in-vitro activities of propanol, combination of 1-propanol, 2-propanol and mecetronium ethylsulphate, polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)-iodine, triclosan and chlorhexidine were determined using a broth macrodilution method. Exposure times to the disinfectant ranged from 15 s to 2 min and concentrations ranged from undiluted to a 1:4000 dilution in order to investigate the impact of inadvertent dilution that might occur in clinical practice. Five American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) type strains (A. baumannii, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus) were used as controls. All disinfectants inhibited growth of all isolates at concentrations and contact times recommended by the respective manufacturer. With most of the disinfectants tested, a relevant number of viable bacteria remained if contact times < 30s or diluted agents were used. No significant differences in susceptibility between outbreak-related and sporadic strains were detected, but larger studies would be required to confirm this. Resistance to currently used disinfectants is probably not a major factor in the epidemic spread of A. baumannii. However, even minor deviations from the recommended procedures leading to decreased concentrations or exposure times may play a role in nosocomial cross-transmission.
TI  - Comparative in vitro antimicrobial activity of tigecycline, a new glycylcycline compound, in freshly prepared medium and quality control.
AB  - The in vitro spectra of activity of tigecycline and tetracycline were determined  for 2,490 bacterial isolates representing 50 different species or phenotypic groups. All isolates were tested simultaneously by broth microdilution using freshly prepared Mueller-Hinton broth and by disk diffusion. Portions of these data were submitted to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in support of the sponsor's application for new drug approval. In a separate study, MIC and disk diffusion quality control ranges were determined. The tigecycline MICs at which 50%/90% of bacteria were inhibited were (in microg/ml) as follows: for Streptococcus spp., 0.06/0.12; for Moraxella catarrhalis, 0.06/0.12; for Staphylococcus spp., 0.12/0.25; for Enterococcus spp., 0.12/0.25; for Listeria monocytogenes, 0.12/0.12; for Neisseria meningitidis, 0.12/0.25; for Haemophilus spp., 0.25/0.5; for Enterobacteriaceae, 0.05/2.0; for non-Enterobacteriaceae, 0.5/8.0. Tigecycline was consistently more potent than tetracycline against all species studied. The data from this study confirm the FDA-approved MIC and disk diffusion breakpoints for tigecycline for Streptococcus spp. other than Streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococci, and Enterobacteriaceae. Provisional breakpoints for Haemophilus spp. and S. pneumoniae are proposed based on the data from this study. The following MIC and/or disk diffusion quality control ranges are proposed: Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213, 0.03 to 0.25 microg/ml; S. aureus ATCC 25923, 20 to 25 mm; Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, 0.03 to 0.25 microg/ml and 20 to 27 mm; Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, 9 to 13 mm, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, 0.03 to 0.12 microg/ml; S. pneumoniae ATCC 49619, 0.015 to 0.12 microg/ml and 23 to 29 mm; Haemophilus influenzae ATCC 49247, 0.06 to 0.5 microg/ml and 23 to 31 mm; and Neisseria gonorrhoeae ATCC 49226, 30 to 40 mm.
TI  - Frequency of urinary tract infection in pediatric liver transplantation candidates.
AB  - An increased frequency of infections has been reported in patients with chronic liver disease. The tendency of patients in this population to acquire UTI is not completely understood. We aimed at investigating the incidence of UTI in children with cirrhosis, before liver transplantation. Twenty-six children (9 girls, 17 boys; mean age, 7.66 +/- 5.73 yr) with chronic liver disease who had undergone liver transplantation between 2002 and 2004 were included. On admission for liver transplantation, patients were examined for presence of UTI. Serum biochemistry, complete blood cell count, urinalysis and culture, glomerular filtration rate, and abdominal ultrasonography were performed prior to liver transplantation. Ten of 26 patients (38.5%) were found to have symptomatic UTI. Urine cultures revealed E. coli in five (50%), Klebsiella pneumoniae in three (30%), Enterococcus faecalis in one (10%), and Enterobacter aeruginosa in one (10%) patient(s), respectively, as etiologic factors. The etiologies of chronic liver disease in our patients with UTI were BA in five, PFIC in three, Wilson's disease in one, and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency in one patient. We found a significantly greater number of UTIs in patients with biliary atresia than in those without biliary atresia (p < 0.05). The mean age of the patients with UTI was 2.75 +/- 3.49 yr, which was significantly lower than in those without UTI (9.75 +/- 4.86 yr, p < 0.05). Levels for white blood cells, thrombocytes, ALT, and alkaline phosphatase were significantly higher in patients with UTI than in those without UTI. There were no significant differences between the groups with regard to serum albumin, bilirubin, AST, GGT, BUN, or creatinine levels, glomerular filtration rate, duration of disease, and PELD scores. In patients with bacteriuria, renal USG revealed normal findings in all, but except one patient who had pelvicalyceal dilatation. Scintigraphic findings demonstrated acute pyelonephritis in six (60%) patients with UTI. VCUG demonstrated vesicoureteral reflux in two patients. In conclusion, symptomatic UTI is common in children with cirrhosis. It occurs more frequently in patients with biliary atresia than it does in patients with other types of chronic liver disease. In febrile children with chronic liver disease, UTI should be considered in the differential diagnosis.
TI  - Vapor-phase activities of cinnamon, thyme, and oregano essential oils and key constituents against foodborne microorganisms.
AB  - The aim of the study presented here was to gain knowledge about the vapor-phase antimicrobial activity of selected essential oils and their major putatively active constituents against a range of foodborne bacterial and fungal strains. In a first step, the vapor-phase antimicrobial activities of three commercially available essential oils (EOs)-cinnamon (Cinnamomum zeylanicum), thyme (Thymus vulgaris), and oregano (Origanum vulgare)-were evaluated against a wide range of microorganisms, including Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Yersinia enterocolitica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella choleraesuis), Gram-positive bacteria (Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, and Enterococcus faecalis), molds (Penicillium islandicum and Aspergillus flavus), and a yeast (Candida albicans). The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were generally lower for oregano EO than for the thyme and cinnamon EOs, especially against the relatively resistant Gram-negative. The persistence of the EOs' antimicrobial activities over time was assessed, and changes in the composition of the atmosphere they generated over time were determined using single-drop microextraction (SDME) in combination with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and subsequent analysis of the data by principal component analysis (PCA). More relevant chemicals were selected. In addition, the vapor-phase activities of putatively key constituents of the oils were screened against representative Gram-positive (L. monocytogenes) and Gram-negative (S. choleraesuis) bacteria, a mold (A. flavus), and a yeast (C. albicans). Of the tested compounds, cinnamaldehyde, thymol, and carvacrol showed the strongest antimicrobial effectiveness, so their MICs, defined as the minimum vapor concentrations that completely inhibited detectable growth of the microorganisms, were calculated. To check for possible interactions between components present in the EOs, cinnamon EO was fortified with cinnamaldehyde and thyme EO with thymol, and then the antimicrobial activities of the fortified oils were compared to those of the respective unfortified EOs using fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) indices and by plotting inhibition curves as functions of the vapor-phase concentrations. Synergistic effects were detected for cinnamaldehyde on A. flavus and for thymol on L. monocytogenes, S. choleraesuis, and A. flavus. In all other cases the fortification had additive effects, except for cinnamaldehyde's activity against S. choleraesuis, for which the effect was antagonistic. Finally, various microorganisms were found to cause slight changes over time to the atmospheres generated by all of the EOs (fortified and unfortified) except the fortified cinnamon EO.
TI  - An in vitro system for the comparison of excision and wet-dry swabbing for microbiological sampling of beef carcasses.
AB  - An in vitro system for the comparison of wet-dry swabbing and surface tissue excision was developed to ascertain whether the commonly accepted statement of the advantage (in terms of bacterial recovery) of the tissue excision method is also legitimate when different kinds of bacteria are used. A total of 1,770 sections (2.5 by 10 cm) of bovine skin were individually inoculated on the subcutaneous fat side by spreading various suspensions of marker organisms (nalidixic acid-resistant Escherichia coli, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) at different concentrations and sampled by two standard methods: cotton wet-dry swabbing and excision. Most counts from cuts sampled by excision were significantly (P < 0.05) higher than the wet-dry swabs; however, no differences were observed between the control and the sampling method when sections were inoculated with bacterial solutions at a concentration of 10(3) CFU/ml and sampled by excision. For sections inoculated with bacterial solutions at a concentration of 10(3) CFU/ml, counts given as log CFU/25 cm2 ranged from 1.97 (S. aureus sampled by wet-dry swab) to 3.06 (S. aureus sampled by excision). For sections inoculated at a concentration of 10(4), counts given as log CFU/25 cm(2) ranged from 2.15 (E. faecalis sampled by wet-dry swab) to 3.19 (S. aureus sampled by excision). For sections inoculated at 10(5), counts given as log CFU/25 cm(2) ranged from 2.94 (E. faecalis, wet-dry swab) to 3.98 (S. aureus, excision), and for sections inoculated at 106, counts given as log CFU/25 cm(2) ranged from 3.53 (E. coli, wet-dry swab) to 4.69 (S. aureus, excision). The proposed system, which enabled a considerable amount of samples to be analyzed under controlled experimental conditions and a large number of data to be generated in a short time, demonstrated among the tested microorganisms that whereas the excision method recovered the highest number of bacteria, control means were always (with the exception of an inoculum of 10(3)/ml) significantly higher than means from either of the sampling methods. Our results indicate that particular attention should be paid to the diverse microflora that can contaminate carcasses in a given slaughterhouse and that it is not appropriate to generalize by saying that the destructive method is the reference technique for the bacteriological sampling of carcasses in slaughterhouses, especially when the contamination is higher than 10(3) CFU/25 cm(2).
TI  - Gnotobiotic IL-10-/-;NF-kappa B(EGFP) mice reveal the critical role of TLR/NF-kappa B signaling in commensal bacteria-induced colitis.
AB  - Commensal bacteria and TLR signaling have been associated with the maintenance of intestinal homeostasis in dextran sodium sulfate-induced intestinal injury. The aim of this study was to determine the in vivo role of TLR/NF-kappaB activation in a model of commensal bacteria-induced T cell-mediated colitis. A NF-kappaB reporter gene mouse (NF-kappaBEGFP) (EGFP, enhanced GFP) was crossed to the colitogenic susceptible strain IL-10-/- and derived into germfree conditions using embryo-transfer technology. Germfree IL-10wt/wt;NF-kappaBEGFP and IL-10-/-;NF-kappaBEGFP mice (wt, wild type) were dual associated with the nonpathogenic commensal bacteria strains Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli. EGFP was detected using macroimaging, confocal microscopy, and flow cytometry. IL-10-/-;MyD88-/- mice were used to assess E. faecalis/E. coli-induced TLR-dependent signaling and IL-23 gene expression. Dual-associated IL-10-/-;NF-kappaBEGFP mice developed severe inflammation by 7 wk. Macroscopic analysis showed elevated EGFP expression throughout the colon of bacteria-associated IL-10-/-;NF-kappaBEGFP mice. Confocal microscopy analysis revealed EGFP-positive enterocytes during the early phase of bacterial colonization (1 wk) in both IL-10wt/wt and IL-10-/- mice, while the signal shifted toward lamina propria T cells, dendritic cells, neutrophils, and macrophages in IL-10-/- mice during colitis (7 wk). The NF-kappaB inhibitor BAY 11-7085 attenuated E. faecalis/E. coli-induced EGFP expression and development of colitis. Additionally, E. faecalis/E. coli-induced NF-kappaB signaling and IL-23 gene expression were blocked in bone marrow-derived dendritic cells derived from IL-10-/-;MyD88-/- mice. We conclude that bacteria-induced experimental colitis involves the activation of TLR-induced NF-kappaB signaling derived mostly from mucosal immune cells. Blocking TLR-induced NF-kappaB activity may represent an attractive strategy to treat immune-mediated intestinal inflammation.
TI  - Application of real-time quantitative PCR for the detection of selected bacterial pathogens during municipal wastewater treatment.
AB  - Bacteria were detected at five stages of municipal wastewater treatment using TaqMan(R) real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR). Thirteen probe and primer sets were tested for diverse pathogens that may be present in wastewater, including Aeromonas hydrophila, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, E. coli O157:H7, Helicobacter pylori, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, Listeria monocytogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella sp., and Staphylococcus aureus. The sensitivity of the assay was 100 fg of genomic DNA (=22 gene copies), based on a standard curve generated using A. hydrophila purified DNA. Samples from five stages of wastewater treatment were collected, including raw wastewater, primary effluents, mixed liquor, waste activated sludge and final effluents. In duplicate samples, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, C. perfringens and E. faecalis were detected throughout the wastewater process, and their numbers decreased by 3.52-3.98, 4.23-4.33, 3.15-3.39, and 3.24 orders of magnitude respectively, between the raw wastewater and final effluent stage. This qPCR method was effective for the detection of pathogens in wastewater and confirmed that the risk of exposure to pathogens in the wastewater discharge was well within the Environment Canada guidelines.
TI  - N'-(alpha-aminoacyl)- and N'-alpha-(N-alkylamino)acyl derivatives of vancomycin and eremomycin. II. Antibacterial activity of N'-(alpha-aminoacyl)- and N'-alpha-(N-alkylamino)acyl derivatives of vancomycin and eremomycin.
AB  - The antibacterial activities of the series of novel N'-(alpha-aminoacyl)- and N'-alpha-(N-akylamino)acyl derivatives of eremomycin and vancomycin containing hydrophobic moieties have been investigated. The N'-(N-alkylglycyl) derivatives of vancomycin are more active against vancomycin-susceptible staphylococci and enterococci and glycopeptide intermediate-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (GISA) than the corresponding eremomycin derivatives, but except for N'-[N-(p-octyloxybenzyl)glycyl-vancomycin] (28) and N'-[N-(p-octyloxybenzyl)-L-alanyl-vancomycin (33)--they are less active against glycopeptide-resistant enterococci (GRE). Derivatives 28 and 33 are the most active compounds (MIC's for glycopeptide-sensitive staphylococci and enterococci are 0.25 approximately 1 microg/ml, for GISA 1 approximately 2 microg/ml, for GRE 2 approximately 6 microg/ml). In in vivo studies, derivative 28 was active against S. aureus infections in mice with ED(50) 1 mg/kg versus 2 mg/kg for vancomycin (iv). In general N'-(N-alkylglycyl)-derivatives of vancomycin and eremomycin were more active than the corresponding N'-aminoacylated derivatives of these antibiotics containing other than glycin amino acids (L-Lys, L-Met, L-Orn, L- and D-Ala) and also L- and D-Phe or benzyl-O-L-Tyr.
TI  - Reduced mucosal antimicrobial activity in Crohn's disease of the colon.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: In order to maintain the mucosal barrier against luminal microorganisms the intestinal epithelial cells synthesise various broad-spectrum antimicrobial peptides including defensins and cathelicidins. Recent studies indicate that both may be deficient in Crohn's disease. To elucidate the possible functional consequences of this deficiency antimicrobial activity in colonic mucosa from patients with inflammatory bowel disease and healthy controls was investigated. METHODS: A flow cytometric assay was established to quantitate bacterial killing and test the antibacterial activity of cationic peptide extracts from colonic biopsies taken from patients with active or inactive ileocolonic or colonic Crohn's disease (n = 22), ulcerative colitis (n = 29) and controls (n = 13) against clinical isolates of Bacteroides vulgatus and Enterococcus faecalis or the reference strains Escherichia coli American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) 25922 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923. RESULTS: Compared with controls and ulcerative colitis there was a reduced antimicrobial effect in Crohn's disease extracts that was most evident against B. vulgatus. The antimicrobial effect against E. coli and E. faecalis was significantly lower in Crohn's disease compared with ulcerative colitis. Activity against S. aureus disclosed a similar pattern, but was less pronounced. The differences were independent of the inflammation status or concurrent steroid treatment. Bacteria incubated with biopsy extracts from ulcerative colitis patients frequently showed a characteristic change in cell size and granularity, compatible with more extensive membrane disintegration, compared with bacteria incubated with extracts from controls or Crohn's disease. CONCLUSION: Crohn's disease of the colon is characterized by a diminished functional antimicrobial activity that is consistent with the reported low antibacterial peptide expression.
TI  - [Actual situation in Japan of antimicrobial resistant isolates from patients with urinary tract infection and its control measures].
AB  
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of endodontic sealers, MTA-based cements and Portland cement.
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of different root-end filling materials - Sealer 26, Sealapex with zinc oxide, zinc oxide and eugenol, white and gray Portland cement, white and gray MTA-Angelus, and gray Pro Root MTA - against six different microorganism strains. The agar diffusion method was used. A base layer was made using Muller-Hinton agar (MH) and wells were formed by removing the agar. The materials were placed in the wells immediately after manipulation. The microorganisms used were: Micrococcus luteus (ATCC9341), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC6538), Escherichia coli (ATCC10538), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC27853), Candida albicans (ATCC 10231), and Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 10541). The plates were kept at room temperature for 2 h for prediffusion and then incubated at 37 degrees C for 24 h. Triphenyltetrazolium chloride 0.05% gel was added for optimization, and the zones of inhibition were measured. Data were subjected to the Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn tests at a 5% significance level. The results showed that all materials had antimicrobial activity against all the tested strains. Analysis of the efficacy of the materials against the microbial strains showed that Sealapex with zinc oxide, zinc oxide and eugenol and Sealer 26 created larger inhibition halos than the MTA-based and Portland cements (P < 0.05). On the basis of the methodology used, it may be concluded that all endodontic sealers, MTA-based and Portland cements evaluated in this study possess antimicrobial activity, particularly the endodontic sealers.
TI  - Multiplexed identification of blood-borne bacterial pathogens by use of a novel 16S rRNA gene PCR-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis assay.
AB  - We have developed a novel high-throughput PCR-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis (PCR-LDR-CE) assay for the multiplexed identification of 20 blood-borne pathogens (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Neisseria meningitidis, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacillus anthracis, Yersinia pestis, Francisella tularensis, and Brucella abortus), the last four of which are biothreat agents. The method relies on the amplification of two regions within the bacterial 16S rRNA gene, using universal PCR primers and querying the identity of specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms within the amplified regions in a subsequent LDR. The ligation products vary in color and size and are separated by CE. Each organism generates a specific pattern of ligation products, which can be used to distinguish the pathogens using an automated software program we developed for that purpose. The assay has been verified on 315 clinical isolates and demonstrated a detection sensitivity of 98%. Additionally, 484 seeded blood cultures were tested, with a detection sensitivity of 97.7%. The ability to identify geographically variant strains of the organisms was determined by testing 132 isolates obtained from across the United States. In summary, the PCR-LDR-CE assay can successfully identify, in a multiplexed fashion, a panel of 20 blood-borne pathogens with high sensitivity and specificity.
TI  - Antibacterial and cytotoxic activity of the acetone extract of the flowers of Salvia sclarea and some natural products.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the antibacterial and the cytotoxic activity of the acetone extract of the flowers of Salvia sclarea and of some natural products (sclareol, sclareolide and ambrox). The antibacterial and the cytotoxic activity were determined by the dilution method. Sclareolide, ambrox and sclareol demonstrated a good antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27950, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212. The acetonic extract of the flowers of Salvia sclarea has a significant cytotoxic activity against Hep-2 cells.
TI  - Characterization of the lactococcal group II intron target site in its native host.
AB  - The Lactococcus lactis group II intron (Ll.ltrB) retrohomes into the ltrB gene at high efficiency. To date, the critical DNA bases recognized in vivo by the Ll.ltrB ribonucleoprotein (RNP) have been exclusively elucidated in Escherichia coli. However, recent evidence indicates host-dependant differences in Ll.ltrB mobility, raising the possibility of limitations of the current model for RNP-homing site recognition in the native L. lactis host. In this work, intron retargeting experiments in L. lactis have demonstrated that adherence to specific target site critical bases is not sufficient to predict success or failure of chromosomal invasion, as in E. coli. Accordingly, a quantitative real-time PCR (QPCR) assay was developed to test target site nucleotides previously demonstrated as critical for homing in E. coli, for relevance in its native host. This two-plasmid QPCR homing assay is highly sensitive and, unlike previous E. coli-based assays, resolves differential homing efficiencies in the absence of selection. As in E. coli, deviation from wild type at target site positions -23, -21, -20, -19, and +5 resulted in lower homing efficiencies in L. lactis. Furthermore, the same trends are observed when assaying select variants in Enterococcus faecalis. Our results suggest that these target site positions are critical in both E. coli and L. lactis.
TI  - [Bile duct infections as a late complication after endoscopic sphincterotomy].
AB  - Nowadays endoscopic sphincterotomy (SE) is considered to be a "gold standard" in  the treatment of residual choledocholithiasis and biliary pancreatitis. Nevertheless patients after invasive procedures concerning bile ducts with destruction of Oddi's sphincter often have increased succeptibility to chronic infections of bile ducts. AIM: Assessment of the influence of SE on bacterial colonization, development of main bile duct chronic inflammation and recurrent choledocholithiasis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We included to the study 50 patients with main bile duct lithiasis, who underwent endoscopic cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). Among them there were 32 women in age from 45 to 87 (mean 69.7 +/- 12.3) and 18 men in age from 39 to 84 (mean 59.8 +/- 11.56). The studied group was divided into 3 subgroups: In I (control) group were included 10 patients diagnosed with ERCP techniques because of jaundice of unknown origin. Those patients did't have ERCP or operative revision of bile ducts before, but all of them underwent cholecystectomy in the past. Each II and III group consisted of 20 patients, who underwent SE before 12-24 and 25-36 months earlier respectively. Sterile uodenoscope was inserted to the region of major duodenal papilla, and then a sterile brush was used to collect material to cytological smear (brushing) from main bile duct. In all groups 2 ml of bile were taken by a catheter to a syringe. On the basis of radiograms from ERCP findings, the width of main bile duct was assessed. In all patients blood cell count, aspartate and alanine aminotransferases, gammaglutamyltranspeptidase, alkaline phosphatase, amylase, bilirubin, C-reactive protein and procalcitonine levels were measured. RESULTS: In our study all 40 patients with previously performed endoscopic sphincterotomy (SE) had bacterial colonization in bile ducts, mostly with Gramm negative pathogens. The most virulent pathogens vere cultured from bile duct swabs from patients after two or more revisions of common bile duct, and after a longer time from sphincterotomy. Those patients had multibacterial bile duct infections (Escherichia coli + Pseudomonas aeruginosa; P. aeruginosa + Enterococcus faecalis; E. faecalis + Enterobacter cloacae + Candida albicans; P. aeruginosa + E. cloacae). E. coil and E. faecalis were most frequently cultured (20 and 16 cases respectively). It was observed that with length of time from endoscopic sphincterotomy, the width of main bile duct and also amount of cultured pathogens and their virulency grow. Elevated transaminases activity and serum procalcitonine levels were observed in studied groups. 9 patients after previous sphincterotomy had recurrent lithiasis. CONCLUSIONS: Sphincterotomy contributes to colonization of main bile duct with pathogenic bacteria. With length of time from endoscopic sphincterotomy, and amount of performed endoscopic sphincterotomies the amount of cultured pathogens, their virulency and drug resistance grow. Chronic infection of bile ducts after endoscopic sphincterotomy causes higher risk of recurrent lithiasis.
TI  - A new antibacterial compound produced by an indigenous marine bacteria--fermentation, isolation, and biological activity.
AB  - The use of microorganisms for biological purpose has become an effective alternative to control pathogens. A marine bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated from Eal fish of Baluchistan coast of Pakistan. This strain produced a bactericidal antibiotic against environmental and clinical isolates. In this study, we purified bactericidal antibiotic from the ethyl acetate extract of the cells of P. aeruginosa and analyzed its chemical structure. Based on spectrometric analysis, this compound 1 is proposed to be 1-methyl-1,4 dihydroquinoline and is active against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA), Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Vibrio aliginolyticus, Micrococcus luteus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterobacter faecium but it is not active against G streptococci, Candida albicans, Aspergillus niger. Minimal inhibitory concentration for Gram-positive bacteria was between 50 and 75 microg mL(-1) and for Gram-negative bacteria 75-100 microg mL(-1).
TI  - Assessment and interpretation of bacterial viability by using the LIVE/DEAD BacLight Kit in combination with flow cytometry.
AB  - The commercially available LIVE/DEAD BacLight kit is enjoying increased popularity among researchers in various fields of microbiology. Its use in combination with flow cytometry brought up new questions about how to interpret LIVE/DEAD staining results. Intermediate states, normally difficult to detect with epifluorescence microscopy, are a common phenomenon when the assay is used in flow cytometry and still lack rationale. It is shown here that the application of propidium iodide in combination with a green fluorescent total nucleic acid stain on UVA-irradiated cells of Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Shigella flexneri, and a community of freshwater bacteria resulted in a clear and distinctive flow cytometric staining pattern. In the gram-negative bacterium E. coli as well as in the two enteric pathogens, the pattern can be related to the presence of intermediate cellular states characterized by the degree of damage afflicted specifically on the bacterial outer membrane. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that EDTA-treated nonirradiated cells exhibit the same staining properties. On the contrary, this pattern was not observed in gram-positive Enterococcus faecalis, which lacks an outer membrane. Our observations add a new aspect to the LIVE/DEAD stain, which so far was believed to be dependent only on cytoplasmic membrane permeability.
TI  - Antibacterial effect of autologous platelet gel enriched with growth factors and  other active substances: an in vitro study.
AB  - Platelet-rich plasma is a new inductive therapy which is being increasingly used  for the treatment of the complications of bone healing, such as infection and nonunion. The activator for platelet-rich plasma is a mixture of thrombin and calcium chloride which produces a platelet-rich gel. We analysed the antibacterial effect of platelet-rich gel in vitro by using the platelet-rich plasma samples of 20 volunteers. In vitro laboratory susceptibility to platelet-rich gel was determined by the Kirby-Bauer disc-diffusion method. Baseline antimicrobial activity was assessed by measuring the zones of inhibition on agar plates coated with selected bacterial strains. Zones of inhibition produced by platelet-rich gel ranged between 6 mm and 24 mm (mean 9.83 mm) in diameter. Platelet-rich gel inhibited the growth of Staphylococcus aureus and was also active against Escherichia coli. There was no activity against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Moreover, platelet-rich gel seemed to induce the in vitro growth of Ps. aeruginosa, suggesting that it may cause an exacerbation of infections with this organism. We believe that a combination of the inductive and antimicrobial properties of platelet-rich gel can improve the treatment of infected delayed healing and nonunion.
TI  - Luminex detection of fecal indicators in river samples, marine recreational water, and beach sand.
AB  - Research to understand and remediate coastal pollution is moving toward a multitiered approach in which traditional enumeration of fecal indicators is accompanied by molecular analysis of a variety of targets. Technology that rapidly detects multiple microbial contaminants would benefit from such an approach. The Luminex 100 system is a suspension array that assays multiple analytes rapidly in a single well of a microtiter plate. The ability of the system to simultaneously detect multiple fecal indicating bacteria in environmental samples was tested. Primer/probe sets were designed to simultaneously detect the following fecal indicators: the Bacteroides fragilis group, Enterococcus spp., Escherichia coli and Shigella spp., Bacteroides distasonis, and Ent. faecalis. Specificity and sensitivity of the Luminex probes was tested against laboratory cultures. In addition, sequencing, culture plate testing, and specificity testing with environmental isolates were steps taken to validate the function of the assay with environmental samples. Luminex response to cultures and to environmental samples was consistent with sequencing results, suggesting that the technology has the potential to simultaneously detect multiple targets for coastal water quality applications, particularly as progress is made to efficiently extract DNA from water and sediment matrices.
TI  - Coniothyrione, a chlorocyclopentandienylbenzopyrone as a bacterial protein synthesis inhibitor discovered by antisense technology.
AB  - Bacterial protein synthesis inhibitors interact mainly with rRNA and to some extent ribosomal proteins, which are potential targets for developing new antibacterial agents. Specifically, the ribosomal protein S4 of the 30s ribosomal subunit known as ribosomal protein small-subunit D (rpsD) may be useful as a target. The antisense-rpsD gene-sensitized two-plate assay led to the discovery of a novel chlorinated cyclopentandienylbenzopyrone antibiotic, coniothyrione, C14H9ClO6, isolated from Coniothyrium cerealis MF7209. It exhibited liquid MICs of 16-32 microg/mL against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Enterococcus faecalis and >64 microg/mL against Escherichia coli. Isolation, structure elucidation, and antibacterial activity of coniothyrione are described.
TI  - Evaluation of the low dose level of a heat-killed and dried cell preparation of Enterococcus faecalis to prevent porcine edema disease using experimental infection model with enterotoxcemic Escherichia coli in weaning pigs.
AB  - Porcine edema disease (ED) is caused by Shiga toxin 2e-producing Escherichia coli (STEC). ED has become frequent in pig farms, and the use of antimicrobials has resulted in the development of antimicrobial-resistant STEC. Accordingly, the use of materials other than antimicrobials is requested for the prevention of ED. Oral administration of a heat-killed and dried cell preparation of Enterococcus faecalis strain EC-12 (EC-12) to weaning pigs was previously demonstrated to decrease animal mortality in a STEC-contaminated farm at 0.05% (w/w) dose level. In this study, pigs experimentally infected with STEC were used as a model for ED to evaluate the low dose level of EC-12 to prevent ED. Fifteen 21-day-old pigs were divided into 5 groups: STEC challenge with the basal diet, STEC challenge with EC-12 supplemented at 0.005, 0.01, or 0.05% (w/w) to the basal diet, and no STEC challenge with the basal diet. The challenge was carried out when the animals were 25, 26, and 27 days old using STEC contained in capsules resistant against gastric digestion. All pigs were euthanized at 32 days of age. The daily weight gain, feed conversion ratio, and palpebral edema were improved by supplementation with 0.05% EC-12, but not by the low dose levels. Accordingly, 0.05% level of supplementation was needed for EC-12 to improve clinical symptoms in weaning piglets infected by STEC.
TI  - Bacterial translocation in small intestinal ischemia-reperfusion injury and efficacy of Anti-CINC antibody treatment.
AB  - The involvement of bacterial translocation in small intestinal ischemia-reperfusion injuries and the efficacy of using anti-CINC antibodies for treatment were investigated. A model for ischemia-reperfusion injury of the small intestine was constructed by clamping the supramesenteric artery (for 90 min) in rats. Anti-CINC antibodies and saline were given just before the induction of ischemia in the treatment group and the control group, respectively. Six hours after reperfusion, bacteria were detected in the mesenteric lymph nodes, but the 'bacteria-positive' rate was significantly lower in the treatment group than in the control group. Bacterial cultures and endotoxins in the blood were negative in both groups up to 24 h later. The plasma cytokine levels showed similar variations, although the increases were significantly lower after reperfusion in the treatment group. In addition, the degrees of neutrophil infiltration and mucosal injury were attenuated in the small intestine, and the structure of the liver was maintained. Furthermore, the 1-week survival was improved. These results suggest that bacterial translocation occurred predominantly via the lymphatic system and that anti-CINC antibody treatment exerted a protective effect against small intestinal ischemia-reperfusion injury.
TI  - Glicentin inhibits internalization of enteric bacteria by cultured INT-407 enterocytes.
AB  - Glicentin, the main component of enteroglucagon, has trophic effects on intestinal mucosa. It may also have an inhibitory effect on extraintestinal invasion of enteric bacteria. We have established an in vitro bioassay system for determining the effects of recombinant human glicentin on bacterial internalization by confluent enterocytes. An INT-407 cell line was serum-deprived for 2 days and was then treated on transwell filters for 24 h with a medium containing one of the following: glicentin 100 ng-1 microg/ml, glucagons-like peptide-2 (GLP-2) 1 microg/ml, 10% fetal bovine serum (FCS), or without any growth factors. Pure cultures of Salmonella enteritidis, Escherichia coli, and Enterococcus faecalis were introduced to the upper chambers of the filter units. Following 2 h of incubation the numbers of bacteria in the lower chambers were measured. Pretreatment of enterocytes with glicentin inhibited bacterial internalization compared to untreated or GLP-2 enterocytes. Glicentin was associated with inhibition of enterocyte internalization of enteric bacteria by a mechanism that might be related to the integrity of the enterocyte adhesive junctions and tight junctions and to the production of sIgA. Glicentin seems to have a function as a barrier-sustaining agent that inhibits extraintestinal invasion of enteric bacteria.
TI  - CW-270033, a novel pyrrolidinyl-thio carbapenem, has potent antimicrobial activity in vitro and in vivo.
AB  - CW-270033, an injectable carbapenem, is a novel, synthesized pyrrolidinyl-thio carbapenem. In the present study, the in-vitro and in-vivo antibacterial activities of CW-270033 against wild-type strains and clinical isolates were compared with those of imipenem and meropenem. CW-270033 was more active than imipenem against Gram-negative (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) clinical isolates, but was slightly less active than meropenem. Against the Gram-positive clinical isolates methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), CW-270033 was slightly more active than meropenem, but was less active than imipenem. CW-270033 displayed potent in-vivo activity against E. coli ATCC 25922, P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853, and S. aureus SMITH in the mouse systemic infection model; the efficacy of CW-270033 in this model was 2--7 fold higher than that of meropenem. This activity was comparable to the in-vitro activity of CW-270033. An intravenous injection of CW-270033 showed that the half-life of CW-270033 in serum in mice was about 20 min, which was about two times that of meropenem. CW-270033 was also found to be resistant to hydrolysis by the mouse renal dehydropeptidase I (DHP-I) enzyme.
TI  - Evaluation of the enteric microflora of captive whooping cranes (Grus americana)  and sandhill cranes (Grus canadensis).
AB  - The enteric flora of captive whooping cranes (Grus americana) and sandhill cranes (Grus canadensis) has not been well described, despite its potential importance in the understanding of both the normal condition of the intestinal physiology of these animals and the altered colonization within disease states in these birds. Nineteen whooping cranes and 23 sandhill cranes housed currently at the Calgary Zoo or its affiliated Devonian Wildlife Conservation Centre (DWCC) in Calgary, Alberta were sampled from October 2004-February 2005 by collecting aerobic and anaerobic cloacal swabs from each bird. There were seven major groupings of bacteria isolated from both species of crane. Gram-positive cocci, coliforms, and gram-negative bacilli were the most prevalent types of bacteria isolated for both crane species, with Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus Group D, not Enterococcus the bacterial species isolated most commonly. There was a significant difference in the average number of isolates per individual between the two crane species but no differences between age or gender categories within crane species. Campylobacter sp. were isolated from five whooping cranes. The potential zoonotic pathogen Campylobacter jejuni was isolated from one whooping crane and C. upsaliensis was isolated from a second. Three other isolates were unspeciated members of the Campylobacter genus and likely belong to a species undescribed previously. The evaluation of the enteric cloacal flora of whooping cranes and sandhill cranes illustrates that differences exist between these two closely related crane species, and highlights the potential implications these differences may have for current practices involving captive wildlife.

TI  - Potent, synergistic inhibition of Staphylococcus aureus upon exposure to a combination of the endopeptidase lysostaphin and the cationic peptide ranalexin.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Successful treatment of infections involving multiply drug-resistant  methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is becoming increasingly difficult. In this work, we have investigated the potential of combining lysostaphin with cationic antimicrobial peptides to effectively inhibit Staphylococcus aureus. METHODS: S. aureus strains were grown in 96-well plates in the presence of increasing concentrations of lysostaphin and the peptides ranalexin, dermaseptin S3(1-16) or magainin 2. Growth was determined visually after 48 h and the plates imaged, or by automated optical density readings in a plate reader. Susceptibility to the combination of lysostaphin and ranalexin was also determined by viable cell counts. The efficacy of combined lysostaphin and ranalexin on a solid surface was tested via disc diffusion assays. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Combination of lysostaphin with ranalexin resulted in potent, synergistic inhibition of S. aureus MSSA476 and MRSA252. Synergistic inhibition was specific for lysostaphin-susceptible staphylococci and was not observed with clinical isolates of the Gram-negative Escherichia coli, or other Gram-positive organisms, such as Enterococcus faecalis. Lysostaphin was not specifically synergistic with ranalexin alone. Synergy was also observed with two other cationic antimicrobial peptides, magainin 2 and dermaseptin s3(1-16); although combination with ranalexin was most potent. Synergistic inhibition by ranalexin in combination with lysostaphin resulted in an enhanced bactericidal effect. Importantly, synergy between lysostaphin and ranalexin was also observed after impregnation and drying in filter paper discs that clearly inhibited growth of S. aureus on the surface of agar; a solid, porous matrix. Thus, the combination could represent a novel route to target wounds infected with drug-resistant MRSA via dressings impregnated with the two compounds.
TI  - Biomedical evaluation of two sympatric lemur species (Propithecus verreauxi deckeni and Eulemur fulvus rufus) in Tsiombokibo Classified Forest, Madagascar.
AB  - Complete medical examinations were performed on 20 wild Decken's sifaka (Propithecus verreauxi deckeni) and 20 wild red-fronted brown lemurs (Eulemurfulvus rufus) from western Madagascar. Each animal received a complete physical examination, and weight, body temperature, heart rate, and respiratory rate were recorded and ectoparasites collected. Blood samples were collected for complete blood cell count, differential white blood cell count, hemoparasite examination, serum biochemical profile, fat-soluble vitamin analysis, trace mineral analysis, and toxoplasmosis and viral serology. Fecal samples were collected for bacterial culture and endoparasite examination. Significant differences exist between the species for serum chemistry values for creatine phosphokinase, glucose, total protein, albumin, globulin, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, phosphorus, potassium, and chloride; for fat-soluble vitamins 25-hydroxycholecalciferol, retinol, retinyl palmitate, gamma-tocopherol, alpha-tocopherol, and lutein + zeaxanthin; and serum copper. Parasites detected include Lemurostrongylus spp., Lemuricola spp., Trichurus spp., and ectoparasites Haemaphysalis lemuris, Psoroptes, and mites identified to the family Laelapidae. Enteric bacterial flora included Escherichia coli, Citrobacter ssp., Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus cereus, Klebsiella ozaenae, Acinetobacter lwofii, and Enterobacter amnigenus.
TI  - Antimicrobial activities of some tetrahydronaphthalene-benzimidazole derivatives.
AB  - Novel retinoid derivatives containing a benzimidazole moiety were synthesized and tested for their antimicrobial activity. Their antimicrobial activities against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Candida krusei and Candida albicans were evaluated. While some of the compounds exhibited moderate activity against MRSA, S. aureus, E. faecalis, C. krusei and C. albicans, none of the compounds showed activity against E. coli and P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Effect of ovotransferrin, protamine sulfate and EDTA combination on biofilm formation by catheter-associated bacteria.
AB  - AIMS: To determine the effect of a composition comprising ovotransferrin (OT), protamine sulfate (PS) and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) on biofilm formation by catheter-associated bacteria. METHODS AND RESULTS: The in vitro activity of OT, PS and EDTA alone and in combinations against biofilm formation by Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus epidermidis was investigated. All the three compounds either alone or in combinations failed to inhibit the growth completely at the concentrations tested. However, the subinhibitory concentrations of three compounds in a composition showed synergistic inhibitory effect on biofilm formation by K. pneumoniae, Ps. aeruginosa and S. epidermidis. Furthermore, 79-95% reduction in Ps. aeruginosa and S. epidermidis biofilm formation was observed in a clear vinyl urinary catheter treated with the composition. CONCLUSION: The subinhibitory concentrations of OT, PS and EDTA in a composition were effective in reducing biofilm formation by catheter-associated bacteria. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study shows that a synergistic composition-comprising non-antibiotic generally regarded as safe (GRAS) compounds such as OT, PS and EDTA may be used in the prevention of catheter-related infections.
TI  - In vitro growth control of selected pathogens by Lactobacillus acidophilus- and Lactobacillus casei-fermented milk.
AB  - AIMS: Food-borne pathogen inhibition was tested in the presence of a mixture of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus casei during fermentation under controlled pH conditions. METHODS AND RESULTS: The growth of Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella serotype Typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria innocua, Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis was evaluated for 48 h at 37 degrees C. In the presence of the lactic acid bacteria (LAB), an increase of the generation time was observed for all the gram-positive bacteria evaluated. Staphylococcus aureus was the most sensitive strain showing an increase of the generation time by 210%. However, for all the gram-negative bacteria evaluated, no inhibition occurred after 8 h of fermentation. The soluble portion of Lact. acidophilus- and Lact. casei-fermented milk was recuperated and tested for its antimicrobial activity. Listeria innocua and Staph. aureus were the most sensitive to the presence of fermented milk supernatant showing an inhibition of 85.9% and 84.7%, respectively. This soluble fraction was neutralized to eliminate the antimicrobial effect of the organic acids produced; the most sensitive strains were L. innocua and E. coli O157:H7 showing an inhibition of 65.9% and 61.9%, respectively. Finally, the soluble fraction was neutralized and irradiated at 45 kGy using a (60)Co source to eliminate the possible antimicrobial effect of both organic acids and bacteriocin-like substances. Enterococcus faecalis, E. coli O157:H7 and Staph. aureus were the most affected bacteria by this fraction, showing 39.1, 32 and 31.2% inhibition, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The results obtained in this study suggest the implication of both organic acids and bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances in the antimicrobial activity observed in the soluble fraction of the probiotic preparation. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study revealed the antimicrobial mechanisms of action of Lact. acidophilus- and Lact. casei-fermented milk used to prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhoea.
TI  - [National Study of Control of Nosocomial Infection in Intensive Care Units. Evolutive report of the years 2003-2005].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Describe the national rates of acquired invasive device-related infections in the ICU during 2003, 2004 and 2005, their etiology and evolution of the multiresistance markers. DESIGN: Prospective, observational study. SCOPE: Intensive Care Unit or other units where critical patients are admitted. PATIENTS: 21,608 patients admitted for more than 24 hours in the participating ICUs. MAIN VARIABLES OF INTEREST: Device related infections: pneumonias related with mechanical ventilation (N-MV), urinary infections related with urethral probe (UI-UP) and primary bacteriemias (PB) and/or those related with at risk vascular catheters (BCV). RESULTS: In 2,279 (10.5%) patients, 3,151 infections were detected: 1,469 N-MV, 808 UI-UP and 874 PB/RVC. Incidence rates ranged from 15.5 to 17.5 N-MV per 1,000 days of mechanical ventilation, 5.0 to 6.7 UI-UP per 1,000 days of urethral probe and 4.0 to 4.7 PB/RVC per 1,000 days of vascular catheter. The predominant etiology in the N-MV was meticillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. The UI-UP were originated predominantly by Escherichia coli, Candida albicans and Enterococcus faecalis. A. baumannii and E. coli have increased their resistance to imipenem and ciprofloxacin or cefotaxime, respectively, in the last year controlled. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated rates persist in all the infections controlled, without change in the etiology and increase of resistance of gram-negative bacilli.
TI  - [Bacterial meningitis in Denmark 2002-2003. A nation-wide laboratory-based registration].
AB  - Notification of bacterial meningitis (BM) is likely to be incomplete, and a recent Danish study indicated that unbalanced notification may bias expected aetiology of BM. Therefore the Danish Bacterial Meningitis Group initiated a national registration of culture-positive BM. METHODS: Laboratory data on all bacterial isolates from cerebrospinal fluid deemed to be clinically relevant were identified on a national basis during 2002 and 2003. Bacterial findings were compared to cases notified during the same period. RESULTS: A total of 404 BM cases were identified. The distribution of bacterial species differed from the national notification data during the same period especially with respect to Staphylococcus aureus (6.7% vs. 0.6%), Escherichia coli (3.5% vs. 0%) and non-Streptococcus pneumoniae streptococci (10% vs. 1.9%). The overall notification-rate was 66%, and was below 20% for S. aureus, E. coli, Enterococcus faecalis, non-S. pneumoniae streptococci and for 13 cases of "other bacteria". Sensitivity to antibiotics in the BM cases was as expected for Northern Europe. Reduced sensitivity to penicillin was found in 2/202 S. pneumoniae, in 2/10 Listeria monocytogenes, and 21/27 S. aureus were penicillin resistant. E. coli was resistant to ampicillin in 5 of 13 cases and to gentamicin in 1 of 11 cases. DISCUSSION: A suboptimal notification rate with an unbalanced species distribution was found. Laboratory based data thus constitute an improved basis for future recommendations for empirical treatment of BM. A continued national collaboration may promote the development of quality indicators for diagnosis and initial treatment of BM.
TI  - Identification and quantitation of usnic acid from the lichen Usnea species of Anatolia and antimicrobial activity.
AB  - Six species of lichens, such as Usnea florida, Usnea barbata, Usnea longissima, Usnea rigida, Usnea hirta and Usnea subflorida, were collected from different areas of Anatolia (district of Antalya, Karabuk, Qankiri, Giresun and Trabzon) in Turkey. Their usnic acid amounts in acetone extracts were determined by HPLC. In addition, antimicrobial activities of these extracts were determined against Escherichia coli (ATCC 35218), Enterococcus faecalis (RSKK 508), Proteus mirabilis (Pasteur Ens. 235), Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus megaterium. It was shown that with increasing amount of usnic acid, the antimicrobial activity increased. Usnic acid contents of Usnea species varied between 0.22-6.49% of dry weight.

TI  - Evaluation of the growth inhibitory activities of Triphala against common bacterial isolates from HIV infected patients.
AB  - The isolation of microbial agents less susceptible to regular antibiotics and the rising trend in the recovery rates of resistant bacteria highlights the need for newer alternative principles. Triphala has been used in traditional medicine practice against certain diseases such as jaundice, fever, cough, eye diseases etc. In the present study phytochemical (phenolic, flavonoid and carotenoid) and antibacterial activities of aqueous and ethanol extracts of Triphala and its individual components (Terminalia chebula, Terminalia belerica and Emblica officinalis) were tested against certain bacterial isolates (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Shigella sonnei, S. flexneri, Staphylococcus aureus, Vibrio cholerae, Salmonella paratyphi-B, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Salmonella typhi) obtained from HIV infected patients using Kirby-Bauer's disk diffusion and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) methods. T. chebula was found to possess high phytochemical content followed by T. belerica and E. officinalis in both aqueous and ethanol extracts. Further, most of the bacterial isolates were inhibited by the ethanol and aqueous extracts of T. chebula followed by T. belerica and E. officinalis by both disk diffusion and MIC methods. The present study revealed that both individual and combined aqueous and ethanol extracts of Triphala have antibacterial activity against the bacterial isolates tested.
TI  - Bacterial isolates from severe infections and their antibiotic susceptibility patterns in Italy: a nationwide study in the hospital setting.
AB  - The most frequent agents of severe bacterial infections and their antibiotic susceptibility patterns were determined in patients admitted to 45 Italian hospitals over the years 2002-2003. The most common diagnoses were: sepsis (33.8%), pneumonia (9.4%), intravascular catheter-associated infections (9.3%) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (8.1%). Overall, 5115 bacterial isolates were identified from 4228 patients. Three bacterial species, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli, accounted for more than 50% of the isolates. Other prevalent bacterial isolates were Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis, while Acinetobacter baumanii ranked third among all Intensive Care Unit (ICU) isolates. 7% of S. aureus had intermediate resistance to vancomycin. Although E. faecalis displayed no vancomycin resistance, 34% of vancomycin-resistant isolates were found among Enterococcus faecium, one of the highest rates found to date, emphasizing the difference between these two enterococcal species. All the Gram-positive pathogens were susceptible to linezolid, with the exception of approximately 2% of the enterococcal isolates that were intermediate with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)=4 microg/ml. Almost 10% of Escherichia coli, 14% of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 22% of Serratia marcescens and 50% of Enterobacter cloacae were non-susceptible to cefotaxime. Amikacin was the most active antibiotic against P. aeruginosa that showed lack of susceptibility to ceftazidime, gentamicin, piperacillin and ciprofloxacin ranging from 20 to 35%. Finally, Acinetobacter baumanii showed a high level of resistance to all the antibiotics tested including imipenem (58%). The results obtained in this study, the first of its kind in Italy, offer indications for guiding empirical therapy and implementing specific interventions to fight antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections and their transmission in the hospital setting in Italy.

TI  - Extracellular superoxide production by Enterococcus faecalis promotes chromosomal instability in mammalian cells.
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: We investigated whether Enterococcus faecalis, a Gram-positive intestinal commensal that produces extracellular superoxide, could promote chromosomal instability (CIN) in mammalian cells. METHODS: We measured the ability of E faecalis to promote CIN using hybrid hamster cells (A(L)N) containing human chromosome 11. RESULTS: E faecalis promoted CIN in A(L)N cells with average mutant fractions per 10(5) survivors (+/-SD) of 72.3 +/- 6.7 at 1 x 10(9) cfu mL(-1) compared with 22.2 degrees +/- 4.5 for the no bacteria control. Gamma-irradiation at 2 Gray similarly resulted in 74.7 +/- 5.7 mutant clones per 10(5) survivors. Deletions in chromosome 11 consistent with CIN were verified in 80% of mutant clones. E faecalis-treated A(L)N cells were protected from CIN by superoxide dismutase, gamma-tocopherol, and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors. In a dual-chamber tissue culture model designed to mimic stromal-epithelial cell interactions, macrophages pretreated with E faecalis grown on permeable supports increased mutant fractions 2.5-fold for A(L)N cells. COX-2 was up-regulated by superoxide from E faecalis and mutant fractions decreased when COX-2 was silenced using short interfering RNA. Escherichia coli, a Gram-negative commensal that produces negligible extracellular superoxide, only modestly promoted CIN in this model. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that macrophage COX-2 is induced by superoxide from E faecalis and promotes CIN in mammalian cells through diffusible factors. This mechanism links the oxidative physiology of E faecalis to propagation of genomic instability through a bystander effect, and offers a novel theory for the role of commensal bacteria in the etiology of sporadic colorectal cancer.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of the antimicrobial activity of endodontic sealers.
AB  - The purpose of this study is to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of the endodontic sealers: N-Rickert, Sealapex, AH Plus, Mineral Trioxide Aggregate (MTA) and portland cement. The Agar diffusion method was used in plates previously inoculated with the following microorganisms: C. albicans, S. aureus, E. faecalis, E. coli. The diameters of microbial inhibition zones were measured after 24 hours of incubation in kiln at 37 degrees C. According to the methodology used, it was possible to conclude that only the sealers AH Plus and N-Rickert presented antimicrobial activity against C. albicans, S. aureus, and E. coli; no antimicrobial activity in MTA, Sealapex and portland cement was observed. N-Rickert presented the largest inhibition zones varying from 8 to 18 mm, and the microorganism E. faecalis was resistant against all sealers tested.
TI  - Structure of the response regulator VicR DNA-binding domain.
AB  - The response regulator VicR from the Gram-positive bacterium Enterococcus faecalis forms part of the two-component signal transduction system of the YycFG subfamily. The structure of the DNA-binding domain of VicR, VicR(c), has been solved and belongs to the winged helix-turn-helix family. It is very similar to the DNA-binding domains of Escherichia coli PhoB and OmpR, despite low sequence similarity, but differs in two important loops. The alpha-loop, which links the two helices of the helix-turn-helix motif, is similar to that of PhoB, where it has been implicated in contacting the sigma subunit of RNA polymerase, but differs from that of OmpR. Conversely, the loop following the helix-turn-helix motif is similar to that of OmpR and differs from that of PhoB. YycF/VicR, PhoB and Bacillus subtilis PhoP regulators all recognize almost identical DNA sequences and although there is currently no experimental evidence linking this loop with the DNA, the structure is consistent with possible involvement in selective DNA recognition or binding.
TI  - Genotypic and phenotypic diversity of Lactococcus lactis isolates from Batzos, a  Greek PDO raw goat milk cheese.
AB  - The genotypic and phenotypic variability of 40 Lactococcus lactis isolates obtained from three cheese-making trials of Batzos cheese made one in each, winter, spring and summer was investigated. RAPD-PCR, plasmid profiling and PFGE were used to study the genetic variability and distinguish closely related isolates. Results showed a high degree of heterogeneity among strains. According to PFGE data, all strains except one were clustered together (at a similarity level of approximately 50%) with the L. lactis subsp. lactis reference strain and eleven groups of isolates consisting of 2-8 strains each were distinguished. Plasmid profiling results revealed that there were eight isolates lacking plasmids and nine having unique plasmids. Twenty-three isolates were allocated into six groups. There was an interesting similarity between the plasmid profiling groups and those formed according to PFGE. Clustering of strains according to RAPD-PCR was in agreement with results obtained by both plasmid profiling and PFGE for the majority of the strains. In addition, results obtained by molecular methods indicate a grouping of most of the strains according to the season of cheese production. All strains inhibited the growth of Escherichia coli O157:H7. Their ability to affect the growth of Yersinia enterocolitica, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes and Enterococcus faecalis was strain dependent. In 42.5% of the isolates high acidifying ability in milk after 24 h was recorded and these were isolates, mainly, from fresh cheese. The 75% of the isolates from winter cheese exhibited higher Lys- than Leu-aminopeptidase activity while the approximately 67% of the isolates from summer cheese showed higher Leu- than Lys-aminopeptidase activity. Their caseinolytic activity after growth in milk for 24 h was significant with preference for alpha(s)-casein degradation. The majority (90%) of the strains formed methanethiol from methionine and this ability was strain dependent. These results suggest that among the wild lactococcal population from Batzos cheese there are interesting strains appropriate to be used as starters for the dairy industry.
TI  - Catheter associated infections in hemodialysis patients.
AB  - Hemodialysis catheter related infections (HCRI) are one of the major causes of increasing mortality, morbidity and cost of therapy in hemodialysis patients. Prevention of HCRI requires the identification of predisposing risk factors. To determine the frequency of HCRI risk factors, we studied 116 patients (54% male, mean age of 49.5+/-16 years) patients with HCRI between 2003-2004. Forty one percent of the patients were diabetic. There was a history of previous catheter placement and infection in 41% and 32% of patients, respectively. Pathogenic organisms isolated from blood cultures included Staphylococcus-aureus 42%, Coagulase-negative Staphylococci 20%, E. Coli 19%, Enterococci 7%, Streptococcus D 7%, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 4%, and Klebsiella 1%. Bacterial resistance to vancomycin and amikacin was present in 7% and 4% of the cases, respectively. Hemodialysis catheter related blood borne infections comprised 67% of the total blood-borne infections in our hospital. No significant statistical association was found between HCRI and age, gender, diabetes mellitus, serum albumin level <30 g/L, leukocyte count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, anatomical location of catheter, mean duration of antibiotic therapy, mean catheter duration, frequency of hemodialysis sessions, pathogenic organisms, and history of previous catheter infection. We conclude that the prevalence of pathogenic organisms of HCRI were similar to previous studies. However, bacterial resistance to antibiotics was low. The mean duration of catheter usage was longer than previously reported.
TI  - Histidine-rich glycoprotein exerts antibacterial activity.
AB  - Histidine-rich glycoprotein (HRGP), an abundant heparin-binding protein found in  plasma and thrombocytes, exerts antibacterial effects against Gram-positive bacteria (Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus) and Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Fluorescence studies and electron microscopy to assess membrane permeation showed that HRGP induces lysis of E. faecalisbacteria in the presence of Zn2+ or at low pH. Heparin blocked binding of the protein to E. faecalis and abolished antibacterial activity. Furthermore, truncated HRGP, devoid of the heparin-binding and histidine-rich domain, was not antibacterial. It has previously been shown that peptides containing consensus heparin-binding sequences (Cardin and Weintraub motifs) are antibacterial. Thus, the peptide (GHHPH)4, derived from the histidine-rich region of HRGP and containing such a heparin-binding motif, was antibacterial for E. faecalis in the presence of Zn2+ or at low pH. The results show a previously undisclosed antibacterial activity of HRGP and suggest that the histidine-rich and heparin-binding domain of HRGP mediates the antibacterial activity of the protein.
TI  - The enumeration of chlorine-injured Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis is enhanced under conditions where reactive oxygen species are neutralized.
AB  - AIM: To investigate the effect of neutralization of reactive oxygen species (ROS-neutralized conditions) on the enumeration of chlorine-injured Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis using selective and nonselective media. METHODS: Pure cultures of E. coli NCTC8912 and Ent. faecalis NCTC775 were injured using dilute sodium hypochlorite, at free chlorine levels of 0.6 and 0.9 microg ml(-1), respectively, and then enumerated at 37 degrees C by surface plate counts on nonselective nutrient (N) agar and on several selective media, either under (i) standard aerobic conditions; (ii) aerobic conditions using growth medium, supplemented with 0.05%-w/v sodium pyruvate, to neutralize peroxides; or (iii) conditions designed to neutralize ROS, using a combination of 0.05%-w/v sodium pyruvate in the growth medium, together with incubation in an anaerobic jar. RESULTS: The counts obtained on the nonselective medium were lowest under aerobic conditions in unsupplemented medium, higher in pyruvate-supplemented (peroxide-neutralized) medium and highest for ROS-neutralized conditions. Counts for the selective media were often lower than those for nonselective N (nutrient) agar, with enhancement under peroxide-neutralized conditions and a further increase in counts under ROS-neutralized conditions. Broadly similar observations were made for three other strains of each organism. CONCLUSIONS: Chlorine-injured E. coli and Ent. faecalis become sensitive to ROS, giving higher counts under ROS-neutralized enumeration conditions than under conventional aerobic conditions. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The enhancement in counts observed under ROS-neutralized conditions indicate that the addition of pyruvate to the growth medium may not fully counteract the effects of sublethal injury under aerobic conditions, which is a novel observation. Thus, ROS-neutralized conditions may be required for optimal enumeration of faecal indicator bacteria. Furthermore, the lower counts, obtained using selective media indicate that the sensitivity of chlorine-injured bacteria to selective agents is not necessarily reversed under ROS-neutralized conditions.
TI  - A type IV-secretion-like system is required for conjugative DNA transport of broad-host-range plasmid pIP501 in gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - Plasmid pIP501 has a very broad host range for conjugative transfer among a wide  variety of gram-positive bacteria and gram-negative Escherichia coli. Functionality of the pIP501 transfer (tra) genes in E. coli was proven by pIP501 retrotransfer to Enterococcus faecalis (B. Kurenbach, C. Bohn, J. Prabhu, M. Abudukerim, U. Szewzyk, and E. Grohmann, Plasmid 50:86-93, 2003). The 15 pIP501 tra genes are organized in a single operon (B. Kurenbach, J. Kopec, M. Magdefrau, K. Andreas, W. Keller, C. Bohn, M. Y. Abajy, and E. Grohmann, Microbiology 152:637-645, 2006). The pIP501 tra operon is negatively autoregulated at the transcriptional level by the conjugative DNA relaxase TraA. Three of the 15 pIP501-encoded Tra proteins show significant sequence similarity to the Agrobacterium type IV secretion system proteins VirB1, VirB4, and VirD4. Here we report a comprehensive protein-protein interaction map of all of the pIP501-encoded Tra proteins determined by the yeast two-hybrid assay. Most of the interactions were verified in vitro by isolation of the protein complexes with pull-down assays. In conjunction with known or postulated functions of the pIP501-encoded Tra proteins and computer-assisted prediction of their cellular location, we propose a model for the first type IV-secretion-like system encoded by a conjugative plasmid from gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - [Distribution of bacteria isolated from urine cultures in Malatya University Hospital laboratory (letter)].
AB  - The aim of this letter was to report the distribution of bacterial species isolated from the urine samples of patients in Malatya, which is located in Estern Anatolia part of Turkey. A total of 3.774 urine cultures were performed in the period of April-June 2006, and 792 (21%) of them yielded bacterial growth. The isolates have been identified by conventional methods and confirmed by Phoenix 100 (Becton-Dickinson) system. As a result, 702 (89%) Gram negative and 90 (11%) Gram positive bacteria were isolated from the samples. The most frequently isolated bacteria were Escherichia coli (58%), followed by Klebsiella spp. (14%), Pseudomonas spp. (6.4%), Enterococcus spp. (5%), Staphylococcus spp. (3.8%) and Streptococcus spp. (1.7%). The species distribution was found as follows; K. pneumoniae ssp pneumoniae (95/110), P. aeruginosa (48/51), E.faecalis (27/40), E. cloacae (19/29), P.mirabilis (19/22), C.freundii (8/12), coagulase negative staphylococci (19/30) and S. aureus (11/30). The first three array were shared by E. coli, Klebsiella spp. and Pseudomonas spp. for the samples of both outpatients and inpatients, while Pseudomonas spp. and E. coli were the most frequently isolated bacteria from the urine samples of intensive care unit patients. Our data was found parallel to the results of other national and international studies.
TI  - Construction of plasmid vector for expression of bacteriocin N15-encoding gene and effect of engineered bacteria on Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - A 6.09-kb plasmids vector pOri253 was constructed from the plasmid pIL253 (5.2 kb) and a 0.89-kb fragment of oriColE1 from pBluescript II KS. The bifunctional plasmid pOri253 conferred erythromycin resistance in both Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis. It has unique sites for EcoRI, BamHI, SalI, and PstI derived from pIL253 and was lost at a low rate in E. faecalis JCM8726 when cultured in Man, Rogosa, & Sharpe broth without antibiotic. The lactococcal promoter P23 was inserted at one end of the pOri253 multicloning site. Gene expression was assessed by an entAI gene, which produced bacteriocin N15. The E. faecalis harboring constructed plasmid carrying P23 (pOrient23) had more antibacterial activity than parental E. faecalis JCM8726 and its clone harboring non-P23-containing plasmid (pOrient), as determined by means of an overlay method.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of crude extracts from plants Bryophyllum pinnatum and Kalanchoe crenata.
AB  - Extracts from the leaves of Bryophyllum pinnatum and Kalanchoe crenata were screened for their antimicrobial activities. Solvents used included water, methanol, and local solvents such as palmwine, local gin (Seaman's Schnapps 40% alcoholic drink,) and "omi ekan-ogi" (Sour water from 3 days fermented milled maize). Leaves were dried and powdered before being soaked in solvents for 3 days. Another traditional method of extraction by squeezing raw juice from the leaves was also employed. All extracts were lyophilized. These extracts were tested against some gram-negative organisms (Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Shigella flexneri, Salmonella paratyphi, Citrobacter spp); gram-positive organisms Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25213, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis) and a fungus (Candida albicans). Agar well diffusion and broth dilution methods were used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) at concentrations of 512 mg/ml to 4 mg/ml. All the organisms except Candida albicans were susceptible to the extracts obtained from the traditional method. The squeezed-leaf juice of Kalanchoe crenata was the most active one with MIC of 8 mg/ml against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Bacillus subtilis, 32 mg/ml against Shigella flexneri, 64 mg/ml against Escherichia coli and 128 mg/ml against the control strain Staphylococcus aureus while its MBC is 256 mg/ml against these organisms except Bacillus subtilis and Klebsiella pneumoniae. The gram-positive organisms were more sensitive to the methanol and local gin-extract of Bryophyllum pinnatum. Extracts from other solvents showed moderate to weak activity.
TI  - Exploring the antibacterial and hemolytic activity of shorter- and longer-chain beta-, alpha,beta-, and gamma-peptides, and of beta-peptides from beta2-3-aza- and beta3-2-methylidene-amino acids bearing proteinogenic side chains--a survey.
AB  - The antibacterial activities of 31 different beta-, mixed alpha/beta-, and gamma-peptides, as well as of beta-peptides derived from beta2-3-aza- and beta3-2-methylidene-amino acids were assayed against six pathogens (Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa), and the results were compared with literature data. The interaction of these peptides with mammalian cells, as modeled by measuring the hemolysis of human erythrocytes, was also investigated. In addition to those peptides designed to fold into amphiphilic helical conformations with positive charges on one face of the helix, one new peptide with hemolytic activity was detected within the sample set. Moreover, it was demonstrated that neither cationic peptides used for membrane translocation (beta3-oligoarginines), nor mixed alpha/beta- or gamma-peptides with somatostatin-mimicking activities display unwanted hemolytic activity.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of diterpenoids from hairy roots of Salvia sclarea L.: salvipisone as a potential anti-biofilm agent active against antibiotic resistant Staphylococci.
AB  - The antimicrobial activities of crude dichloromethane fractions from acetone extracts of Agrobacterium rhizogenes transformed roots and roots of field-grown plants of Salvia sclarea as well as four pure abietane diterpenoids isolated from the hairy root cultures were determined. The growth of Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis) but not Gram-negative ones (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) or pathogenic fungi (Candida albicans) was inhibited by fractions tested at concentrations of 37.5-75.0 microgml(-1). Abietane diterpenoids: salvipisone, aethiopinone, 1-oxoaethiopinone and ferruginol were shown to be bacteriostatic as well as bacteriocidal for the cultures of S. aureus and S. epidermidis strains, regardless of their antibiotic susceptibility profile. This was demonstrated by using simultaneously the optical density measuring method and 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide-reduction assay. The highest activity was shown by salvipisone which demonstrated also a very interesting activity when its effect on 24-h-old staphylococcal biofilm cells viability was examined. It limited the survival of biofilms formed by S. aureus as well as by S. epidermidis, putting this compound to the list of potential anti-biofilm agents, better than most of known antibiotics.
TI  - Prevalence of bacterial species in cats with clinical signs of lower urinary tract disease: recognition of Staphylococcus felis as a possible feline urinary tract pathogen.
AB  - This study investigated the prevalence of bacterial pathogens of the urinary tract in Australian cats. Urine was collected by cystocentesis and subjected to urinalysis, bacterial culture and susceptibility testing. A total of 126 isolates were obtained from 107 culture-positive cats. Escherichia coli was most commonly isolated (37.3% of isolates) with the majority of isolates showing susceptibility to the 14 antimicrobials tested. Just over a quarter of isolates (27.0%) were Enterococcus faecalis, which showed resistance to cephalosporins and clindamycin. Staphylococcus felis, a previously unreported feline urinary tract pathogen which was susceptible to all antimicrobial agents tested, comprised 19.8% of the isolates. S. felis was significantly associated with urine that had a higher specific gravity (p=0.011) and pH (p=0.006) and was more likely to contain crystals (p=0.002) than urine from which other bacterial species were isolated. This is the first published study that associates the isolation of S. felis with clinical signs of lower urinary tract disease in cats.
TI  - Comparison of BACTEC PLUS blood culture media to BacT/Alert FA blood culture media for detection of bacterial pathogens in samples containing therapeutic levels of antibiotics.
AB  - Blood culture bottles with antimicrobial removal systems are recommended for patients who develop fever while on antibiotics. This study compared the ability of Becton Dickinson (Sparks, MD) BACTEC PLUS bottles and bioMerieux (Durham, NC) BacT/Alert FA bottles to effectively remove vancomycin, cefoxitin, ceftriaxone, cefepime, piperacillin-tazobactam, ampicillin, oxacillin, gentamicin, and a combination of gentamicin/penicillin, thus allowing bacterial pathogens to grow. Each bottle was spiked with 10 ml of human blood, antibiotic, and strains of organisms susceptible to the antibiotic evaluated. The organisms used were type strains and clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin susceptible and resistant), Streptococcus pneumoniae, a viridans streptococcus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Testing was completed in triplicate, using 10 to 100 CFU/ml of organisms with various concentrations of each antibiotic. Two rounds of testing were completed per antibiotic/organism combination. Bottles were mixed and loaded onto their respective instruments as per the manufacturer's instructions. Antimicrobial removal was evaluated on the basis of time to detection of organism growth, for up to 5 days of incubation. Overall, the BacT/Alert FA system recovered 25.1% of strains from test bottles and 96.9% of strains from growth control bottles (no antibiotic added), and the BACTEC PLUS system recovered 95.1% of strains from test bottles and 100% of strains from growth control bottles. Both systems performed well in the detection of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the presence of gentamicin. In the presence of ceftriaxone, neither system was able to recover Streptococcus pneumoniae. The ability to remove vancomycin and cefoxitin was also determined by measuring antibiotic levels remaining in bottles after 1 h of incubation. The results demonstrated remaining levels of 72 to 90% of vancomycin and 71 to 72% of cefoxitin in the BacT/Alert system. For the BACTEC system, remaining levels were 0 to 30% of vancomycin and 0% of cefoxitin. Under these simulated conditions, the BACTEC PLUS system was superior to the BacT/Alert FA system in recovering gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial pathogens in the presence of beta-lactam antibiotics, gentamicin/penicillin, and vancomycin.
TI  - Capillary isoelectric focusing and fluorometric detection of proteins and microorganisms dynamically modified by poly(ethylene glycol) pyrenebutanoate.
AB  - The nonionogenic pyrene-based tenside, poly(ethylene glycol) pyrenebutanoate, was prepared and applied in capillary isoelectric focusing with fluorometric detection. This dye was used here as a buffer additive in capillary isoelectric focusing for a dynamic modification of the sample of proteins and microorganisms. The values of the isoelectric points of the labeled bioanalytes were calculated with use of the fluorescent pI markers and were found comparable with pI of the native compounds. The mixed cultures of proteins and microorganisms, Escherichia coli CCM 3954, Staphylococcus epidermidis CCM 4418, Proteus vulgaris, Enterococcus faecalis CCM 4224, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, the strains of the yeast cells, Candida albicans CCM 8180, Candida krusei, Candida parapsilosis, Candida glabrata, Candida tropicalis, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae were reproducibly focused and separated by the suggested technique. Using UV excitation for the on-column fluorometric detection, the minimum detectable amount was down to 10 cells injected on the separation capillary.
TI  - Evaluation of significance of bacteria in larval development of Cochliomyia macellaria (Diptera: Calliphoridae).
AB  - Bacteria were isolated and identified from the digestive tract of the secondary screwworm, Cochliomyia macellaria (F.) (Diptera: Calliphoridae), and their role in the larval development of this insect was assessed in laboratory bioassays. The analysis of 16S rDNA sequences revealed that the bacterial isolates represented four species: Providencia sp., Escherichia coli O157:H7 (Escherich), Enterococcus faecalis (Orla-Jensen), and Ochrobactrum sp. (Holmes). Developmental assays demonstrated that C. macellaria larvae are able to develop on a sterile blood agar, and no bacteria are required to complete larval development. Indeed, developmental times were shorter and survival rates of C. macellaria on a sterile blood agar and the modified Harris rearing diet were greater compared with that on the blood agar inoculated with individual and mixed bacterial isolates. The cultures of Ochrobactrum sp. and E. faecalis supported larval development to a significantly greater extent than those of Providencia sp. and E. coli O157:H7. The presence of bacteria in newly emerged C. macellaria adults also was assessed and revealed that the bacteria in the gut of larvae can survive pupation and colonize the gut of adult flies. This study shows that development of larvae of C. macellaria does not depend on bacteria and that some bacterial isolates negatively impact larval development.
TI  - Effect of solar radiation on survival of indicator bacteria in bathing waters.
AB  - Sunlight exposure is considered to be the most important cause of "natural disinfection" in surface water environments. The UV-B portion of the solar spectrum is the most bactericidal, causing direct (photo-biological) DNA damage. In the present experimental study, the effect of solar radiation on the elimination of bacteria in water, especially in surface water, was studied. The influence of depth and UV-B transmittance of water was determined. Comparing Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis proved to be the most resistant organism. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was shown to be the most sensitive indicator bacterium among the tested microorganisms. Results show a significant correlation between radiation intensity and reduction rates. Best elimination of microorganisms occurs on the water surface; with increasing water depth, there is less UV radiation to inactivate bacteria. High turbidity substantially reduces UV-B transmittance in water causing decreased elimination efficiency. The results of the present study show that sunlight, given an appropriate intensity and good water transparency is suitable to inactivate fecal indicator bacteria within a few hours in surface waters and therefore also in bathing waters.
TI  - In-vitro activity of triclosan-eluting ureteral stents against common bacterial uropathogens.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Ureteral stents are commonly used in urology today, but the biofilms that form on them within hours of placement may harbor bacteria that can result in infection or encrustation. Triclosan is an antimicrobial commonly used in consumer and medical products that inhibits bacterial fatty-acid synthesis. The bactericidal and bacteriostatic effect of a triclosan-eluting ureteral stent was tested against clinical isolates of common bacterial uropathogens in an in-vitro setting. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Triclosan eluted from a drug-loaded ureteral stent was suspended in artificial urine with bacterial pathogens (Escherichia coli C1214, Proteus mirabilis 296, Enterococcus faecalis 1131, Klebsiella pneumoniae 280, Staphylococcus aureus Newman, Pseudomonas aeruginosa AK1) to assess growth, virulence-promoter activity, and bacterial adherence to the stent. Generic stents were utilized as controls. RESULTS: Triclosan inhibited the growth of E. faecalis, K. pneumoniae, S. aureus, and P. mirabilis in a dose-dependent manner. Pseudomonas aeruginosa demonstrated significant resistance. Lower concentrations of triclosan downregulated E. coli virulence-factor promoters of outer membrane protein X and p-fimbriae. Triclosan stents had significantly fewer adherent viable bacteria than control stents. CONCLUSIONS: Triclosan-eluting ureteral stents inhibit the growth of common bacterial uropathogens and thus may reduce the incidence of urinary-tract infections and, potentially, encrustation. This drug-eluting stent provides both mechanical drainage of the upper urinary tract and local antibiosis.
TI  - Structure-antimicrobial activity relationship for silanols, a new class of disinfectants, compared with alcohols and phenols.
AB  - Triorganosilanols (R(CH(3))(2)SiOH) were recently reported to exhibit unexpectedly strong disinfectant properties. The antimicrobial activities of silanols were significantly higher than their analogous alcohols. A study of the structural dependence of their antimicrobial activity was conducted against four bacteria, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus faecalis. Silanols, alcohols with structures analogous to the silanols (R(CH(3))(2)COH) and substituted phenols were evaluated as a single class of materials. The minimum lethal concentrations (MLCs), defined as the concentration required for a 7-log reduction in viable bacteria after 1h exposure, were used to measure antimicrobial activity. Octanol-water partition coefficients (logP) and hydrogen bond acidities (deltanu), measured as the shift in frequency of the OH stretching band between free OH and hydrogen-bonded OH to diethyl ether oxygen by infrared spectroscopy, were utilised as dispersive and polar structural parameters, respectively. The correlation established by multiple regression analysis between antimicrobial activities and structural properties of silanols, alcohols and phenols against the four bacteria treated as a single family produced the following equation, log(1/MLC)=0.679 logP+0.0036deltanu-1.909 (n=282, r=0.96, s=0.22). This equation and the significantly high correlation coefficient supported the hypothesis that the lipophilic properties and the H-bond acidities are primary factors for the antimicrobial action of silanols, alcohols and phenols. The high antimicrobial activity of silanols is explained by their greater H-bond acidity and their enhanced lipophilicity.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity and composition of the essential oil of Gontscharovia popovii from Iran.
AB  - The aerial parts of Gontscharovia popovii (B. Fedtsch. and Gontsch.) Boriss. were collected at full flowering stage. The essential oil was isolated by hydrodistillation and analyzed by a combination of capillary GC and GC-MS. Thirty-one components were identified with the main constituent being carvacrol (71.9%), followed by linalool (5.5%), p-cymene (4.5%) and gamma-terpinene (4.4%). The in vitro antimicrobial activity of the essential oil of G. popovii was studied against seven Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae) and three fungi (Candida albicans, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Aspergillus niger). The results of the bioassays showed that the oil exhibited strong antimicrobial activity against all the tested fungi and bacteria except for the resistant bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Antiviral and antimicrobial assessment of some selected flavonoids.
AB  - In the current study, the results of antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral activity tests of four flavonoid derivatives, scandenone (1), tiliroside (2), quercetin-3,7-O-alpha-L-dirhamnoside (3), and kaempferol-3,7-O-alpha-L-dirhamnoside (4), are presented. Antibacterial and antifungal activities of these compounds were tested against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, and Enterococcus faecalis, as well as the fungus Candida albicans by a micro-dilution method. On the other hand, both DNA virus Herpes simplex (HSV) and RNA virus Parainfluenza-3 (PI-3) were employed for antiviral assessment of the compounds using Madin-Darby bovine kidney and Vero cell lines. According to our data, all of the compounds tested were found to be quite active against S. aureus and E. faecalis with MIC values of 0.5 microg/ml, followed by E. coli (2 microg/ml), K. pneumoniae (4 microg/ml), A. baumannii (8 micro/g/ml), and B. subtilis (8 microg/ml), while they inhibited C. albicans at 1 microg/ml as potent as ketoconazole. However, only compound 3 displayed an antiviral effect towards PI-3 in the range of 8-32 microg/ml of inhibitory concentration for cytopathogenic effect (CPE).
TI  - A pilot study on prevention of catheter-related urinary tract infections with fluoroquinolones.
AB  - The objective of this multicenter, randomized, controlled, parallel group trial was to evaluate the efficacy of levofloxacin 250 mg oral, once daily (LVFX), placebo one tablet oral once daily (Placebo [P] group) and ciprofloxacin (CPFX) 500 mg oral, twice daily (single blind), prophylaxis in preventing bacteriuria (> or = 10(3) CFU/ml) in post-surgical catheterized patients. In the modified intention-to-treat (M-ITT) population of the 82 enrolled patients, negative bacteriuria was observed in 92% of LVFX group, in 80% of P group and in 100% of CPFX group while in the per-protocol (PP) population figures were: 100%, 86.4% and 100% respectively. Only one symptomatic urinary tract infection and one surgical wound infection were observed in the P group. Both drugs were well tolerated, showing a safety profile comparable to placebo. The high frequency of negative bacteriuria in the placebo group sounds encouraging as it underlines that the adoption of closed urinary drainage system catheters in hospital setting may reduce the frequency of hospital-acquired infections.
TI  - Dual targeting of GyrB and ParE by a novel aminobenzimidazole class of antibacterial compounds.
AB  - A structure-guided drug design approach was used to optimize a novel series of aminobenzimidazoles that inhibit the essential ATPase activities of bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV and that show potent activities against a variety of bacterial pathogens. Two such compounds, VRT-125853 and VRT-752586, were characterized for their target specificities and preferences in bacteria. In metabolite incorporation assays, VRT-125853 inhibited both DNA and RNA synthesis but had little effect on protein synthesis. Both compounds inhibited the maintenance of negative supercoils in plasmid DNA in Escherichia coli at the MIC. Sequencing of DNA corresponding to the GyrB and ParE ATP-binding regions in VRT-125853- and VRT-752586-resistant mutants revealed that their primary target in Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae was GyrB, whereas in Streptococcus pneumoniae it was ParE. In Enterococcus faecalis, the primary target of VRT-125853 was ParE, whereas for VRT-752586 it was GyrB. DNA transformation experiments with H. influenzae and S. aureus proved that the mutations observed in gyrB resulted in decreased susceptibilities to both compounds. Novobiocin resistance-conferring mutations in S. aureus, H. influenzae, and S. pneumoniae were found in gyrB, and these mutants showed little or no cross-resistance to VRT-125853 or VRT-752586 and vice versa. Furthermore, gyrB and parE double mutations increased the MICs of VRT-125853 and VRT-752586 significantly, providing evidence of dual targeting. Spontaneous frequencies of resistance to VRT-752586 were below detectable levels (<5.2x10(-10)) for wild-type E. faecalis but were significantly elevated for strains containing single and double target-based mutations, demonstrating that dual targeting confers low levels of resistance emergence and the maintenance of susceptibility in vitro.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (2004). III. Secular changes in susceptibility].
AB  - The bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) isolated from patients diagnosed as urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 14 institutions in Japan were collected between August 2004 and July 2005. The susceptibilities of these bacteria to various antimicrobial agents were measured. The bacteria were divided into 2 groups consisting of uncomplicated UTIs and complicated UTIs (with and without indwelling catheter) based on their isolation origins. The results were compared with those obtained between 1995 and 2003. The drug sensitivity of S. aureus in this year was similar to those in up to the previous year and S. aureus showed the best susceptibility to vancomycin (VCM) and arbekacin (ABK). The drug sensitivity of E. faecalis in this year also was similar to those in up to the previous year. The susceptibility of E. coli to cephems in this year was generally good and was similar to those in up to the previous year. MIC90 of cefozopran (CZOP) was the most stable and 0.125 microg/mL or less since 1995. The susceptibility of E. coli to cefpirome (CPR) and cefotiam (CTM) also was good but to cefaclor (CCL), cefixime (CFIX), and cefpodoxime (CPDX) was largely decreased in complicated UTI groups. The sensitivity of E. coli to carbapenems also was good but to carumonam (CRMN) tended to decrease. The susceptibility of E. coli to quinolones, however, has largely changed and has decreased since 2003 in uncomplicated UTIs and 2000 in complicated UTIs. That was suggested the development of the resistance to the drug. The susceptibility of Klebsiella spp. to cefazolin (CEZ), CTM, CCL, CPDX, and cefditoren (CDTR) decreased in the previous year and recovered to the year before the previous year in this year. The susceptibility of Klebsiella spp. to other cephems was stable since 1995, especially against CZOP, the highest sensitivity (MIC90: < or = 0.125 microg/mL) was maintained. The susceptibility of Klebsiella spp. to carbapenems and CRMN also was good. The susceptibility of Klebsiella spp. to aminoglycosides was lower than to CZOP but was stable since 1995. The susceptibility of P. aeruginosa was generally low and has largely changed against the majority of the agents since 1995. The susceptibility of P. aeruginosa isolated from uncomplicated UTIs has largely changed against ceftazidime (CAZ), cefsulodin (CFS), CZOP, imipenem (IPM), meropenem (MEPM), aztreonam (AZT), CRMN, gentamicin (GM), and tobramycin (TOB). The susceptibility of P. aeruginosa isolated from complicated UTIs has largely changed against CSF, CZOP, MEPM, GM, and ciprofloxacin (CPFX). The susceptibility of P. aeruginosa isolated from complicated UTIs has been stable against amikacin (AMK). For annual changes in MIC50, TOB and IPM had a relatively stable and high activity (MIC50: 0.5-2 microg/mL).
TI  - Overexpression, crystallization and preliminary X-ray crystallographic analysis of phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase from Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - Phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase, an essential enzyme in the coenzyme A biosynthetic pathway, catalyzes the reversible transfer of an adenylyl group from ATP to 4'-phosphopantetheine, yielding 3'-dephospho-CoA and pyrophosphate. Enterococcus faecalis PPAT has been overexpressed in Escherichia coli as a fusion with a C-terminal purification tag and crystallized at 297 K using a reservoir solution consisting of 0.1 M sodium HEPES pH 7.5, 0.8 M sodium dihydrogen phosphate and 0.8 M potassium dihydrogen phosphate. X-ray diffraction data were collected to 2.70 A at 100 K. The crystals belong to the primitive tetragonal space group P4(1) (or P4(3)), with unit-cell parameters a = b = 160.81, c = 225.68 A. Four copies of the hexameric molecule are likely to be present in the asymmetric unit, giving a crystal volume per protein weight (V(M)) of 3.08 A(3) Da(-1) and a solvent content of 60.1%.
TI  - Sensitive quantitative detection of commensal bacteria by rRNA-targeted reverse transcription-PCR.
AB  - A sensitive rRNA-targeted reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) method was developed for exact and sensitive enumeration of subdominant bacterial populations. Using group- or species-specific primers for 16S or 23S rRNA, analytical curves were constructed for Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium perfringens, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and the threshold cycle value was found to be linear up to an RNA amount of 10(-3) cell per RT-PCR. The number of bacteria in culture was determined by RT-qPCR, and the results correlated well with the CFU count over the range from 10(0) to 10(5) CFU. The bacterial counts obtained by RT-qPCR were the same as the CFU counts irrespective of the growth phase in vitro, except for C. perfringens during starvation periods; the viable cell counts obtained by using a combination of 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining and SYTO9-propidium iodide double staining were in good agreement with the RT-qPCR counts rather than with the CFU counts. The RT-qPCR method could detect endogenous Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa in feces of hospitalized patients (n = 38) at a level of 10(3) cells per g of feces, and for enumeration of S. aureus or P. aeruginosa spiked into human peripheral blood, the lower detection limit for RT-qPCR quantification of the bacteria was 2 cells per ml of blood, suggesting that this method was equivalent to the conventional culture method. As only 5 h was needed for RT-qPCR quantification, we suggest that rRNA-targeted RT-qPCR assays provide a sensitive and convenient system for quantification of commensal bacteria and for examining their possible invasion of a host.
TI  - High prevalence of ceftazidime-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae and increase of imipenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. in Korea: a KONSAR program in 2004.
AB  - A nationwide antimicrobial resistance surveillance has been conducted since 1997  in Korea. In this study, susceptibility test data generated in 2004 by KONSAR group hospitals were analyzed and compared to those at a commercial laboratory. In hospitals, the rank orders of organisms in 2004 were identical to those in 2003. The most prevalent species was Staphylococcus aureus (20.2%) in hospitals, but Escherichia coli (29.7%) in the commercial laboratory. The proportions of Enterococcus faecium to all isolates of Enterococcus faecalis plus E. faecium were 47.2% in hospitals and 24.9% in the commercial laboratory. The mean resistance rates of significant antimicrobial-organism combinations in hospitals were: oxacillin-resistant S. aureus (68%), oxacillin-resistant (penicillin- nonsusceptible) Streptococcus pneumoniae (68%), vancomycin-resistant E. faecium (25%), cefotaxime-resistant E. coli (14%), ceftazidime- and cefoxitin-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (34% and 32%, respectively), and imipenem-resistant Acinetobacter spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (17% and 24%, respectively). In conclusion, oxacillin-resistant staphylococci, expanded-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant K. pneumoniae, and imipenem-resistant Acinetobacter spp. and P. aeruginosa were prevalent in 2004. Increasing trends were observed for vancomycin-resistant E. faecium, cefoxitin- resistant E. coli and K. pneumoniae, and imipenem-resistant Acinetobacter spp. and P. aeruginosa. Certain antimicrobial- organism combinations were also prevalent among the commercial laboratory-tested strains.
TI  - High risk of bacterobilia in advanced experimental chronic fasciolosis.
AB  - Fasciolosis is recognized as an important human disease. Wistar rats experimentally infected with Fasciola hepatica were examined using data obtained in the advanced chronic state of the disease (200, 300 and 400 days post-infection, dpi). Pigment stones (PS) and bile specimens were collected. The same procedure was applied in control rats. Liver tests were determined using stored serum samples. Bacteriological bile culture revealed viable bacteria (Escherichia coli, 45% of cases, Enterococcus faecalis, 45% and Klebsiella pneumoniae, 10%). The presence of bacterobilia was associated with liver serum enzymes, including aspartate aminotransferase (AST or SGOT), alanine aminotransferase (ALT or SGPT), alkaline phosphatase (AP) and total bilirubin levels. Multivariate analysis suggested an association between bacterobilia and the following factors: duration of parasitic infection and intensity of parasitic infection supported the impression that the obstruction caused by advanced chronic fasciolosis in the rat may be related to biliary sepsis. Extrapolation to human infection in fasciolosis hyperendemic areas is discussed. In conclusion, the results of the rodent model should lead to a reconsideration of treatment features in human disease, i.e. therapeutic strategies should not only include a parasitic treatment but also consider the possibility of bacterial co-infection.
TI  - Resistance of Enterococcus strains isolated from pigs to gastrointestinal tract and antagonistic effect against Escherichia coli K88.
AB  - The intestinal flora plays an important role in health and wellbeing of different organisms. Indigenous microflora can be innocuous or pathogenic. Consumption of food supplemented with beneficial microorganisms as probiotics provides a good health state and this can be maintained and recovered. Currently, probiotic strains of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus are widely used in humans as well as animals. Swine industry would benefit with the application of probiotics, mainly to overcome diarrheal diseases produced by different causes, as a pathogenic E. coli K88. The aim of this work was to isolate strains of Enterococcus from gastrointestinal tract of pigs to use them as probiotic. Two strains of E. faecalis, 2 of E. mundii and 7 of E. faecium were isolated with characteristics of resistance to acid pH, tolerance to biliary salts and a high antagonistic activity (>80%) against E. coli K88. Based on their characteristics and species affinity, we believe that these strains could be administered to pigs as a probiotic.
TI  - Evaluation of antimicrobial and antifungal effects of iodoform-integrating gutta-percha.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The antibacterial and antifungal effects of medicated gutta-percha (MGP) over different time periods have not been evaluated. The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the antimicrobial and antifungal effectiveness of MGP and regular gutta-percha cones over different time periods using the disk diffusion method. METHODS: Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli were spread onto Mueller-Hinton agar, and Candida albicans was spread onto Sabouraud agar supplemented with glucose. Same-size MGP cones, conventional gutta-percha cones and disks impregnated with povidone-iodine were placed on the inoculated plates. The dishes were incubated at 37 degrees C aerobically. Growth inhibition zones were inspected and measured at 24, 48 and 72 hours. For each strain, experiments were performed in triplicate. The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to compare k independent samples. RESULTS: The disks impregnated with povidone-iodine inhibited all bacterial strains for up to 72 hours. No inhibition zones were seen around regular gutta-percha cones. MGP inhibited the growth of all bacteria over 24 hours, but in some cases these effects did not continue over longer periods. Specifically, the antimicrobial properties of MGP cones against E. coli and P. aeruginosa disappeared by 48 and 72 hours. Regardless of time and bacterial strain, MGP was statistically more effective than regular gutta-percha (p < 0.05). Povidone-iodine and MGP were effective against C. albicans for up to 72 hours, but regular gutta-percha exhibited no antifungal activity. CONCLUSION: The antimicrobial and antifungal characteristics of MGP may offer additional advantages over conventional gutta-percha.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of ertapenem against major intra-abdominal pathogens.
AB  - Treatment of intra-abdominal infections remains a challenge owing to their polymicrobial nature and associated mortality risk. Treatment regimens must provide broad-spectrum coverage, including Gram-positive and Gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria of gastrointestinal origin. Ertapenem is a long-acting 1-beta-methyl parenteral group 1 carbapenem antibiotic that has a broad antibacterial spectrum and once-daily dosing supported by clinical studies. It is active against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including Enterobacteriaceae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and most species of anaerobic bacteria. The aim of this study was to measure the killing effects of ertapenem against a selected group of strains responsible for intra-abdominal infections. Gram-negative isolates comprised the following species: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella ozaenae, Enterobacter cloacae and Proteus mirabilis (extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producers and non-producers). Gram-positive isolates comprised methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), Enterococcus faecalis and anaerobic Bacteroides fragilis. Ertapenem activity was tested by determination of minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBCs). Killing curves were performed in monocultures and co-cultures at selected antibiotic concentrations. Ertapenem showed a rapid and potent bactericidal activity in the first few hours of the kinetic curves against E. coli (6 log(10) colony-forming unit (CFU) reduction in the first 2h), B. fragilis (4 log(10) CFU reduction in 4h), MSSA (3 log(10) CFU reduction in 4-6h), K. ozaenae (ESBL+), K. pneumoniae (ESBL+ and -), E. cloacae (ESBL-) in 1h and P. mirabilis (ESBL+) in the first 2h. The potent bactericidal activity of ertapenem compared with ceftriaxone and piperacillin/tazobactam was well demonstrated in the co-cultures of E. coli-B. fragilis and E. coli-B. fragilis-E. faecalis, whilst ertapenem was shown to be bactericidal at 24h in the mixed culture of S. aureus-P. mirabilis. These results support the potent in vitro bactericidal activity of ertapenem against all multiresistant strains selected in this study and the use of this drug in the treatment of intra-abdominal infections.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of some ethnomedicinal plants used by Paliyar tribe from Tamil Nadu, India.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial activity of 18 ethnomedicinal plant extracts were evaluated against nine bacterial strains (Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Ervinia sp, Proteus vulgaris) and one fungal strain (Candida albicans). The collected ethnomedicinal plants were used in folk medicine in the treatment of skin diseases, venereal diseases, respiratory problems and nervous disorders. METHODS: Plants were collected from Palni hills of Southern Western Ghats and the ethnobotanical data were gathered from traditional healers who inhabit the study area. The hexane and methanol extracts were obtained by cold percolation method and the antimicrobial activity was found using paper disc diffusion method. All microorganisms were obtained from Christian Medical College, Vellore, Tamil Nadu, India. RESULTS: The results indicated that out of 18 plants, 10 plants exhibited antimicrobial activity against one or more of the tested microorganisms at three different concentrations of 1.25, 2.5 and 5 mg/disc. Among the plants tested, Acalypha fruticosa, Peltophorum pterocarpum, Toddalia asiatica,Cassia auriculata, Punica granatum and Syzygium lineare were most active. The highest antifungal activity was exhibited by methanol extract of Peltophorum pterocarpum and Punica granatum against Candida albicans. CONCLUSION: This study evaluated the antimicrobial activity of the some ethnomedicinal plants used in folkloric medicine. Compared to hexane extract, methanol extract showed significant activity against tested organisms. This study also showed that Toddalia asiatica, Syzygium lineare, Acalypha fruticosa and Peltophorum pterocarpum could be potential sources of new antimicrobial agents.
TI  - Functional characterization and Me ion specificity of a Ca-citrate transporter from Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - Secondary transporters of the bacterial CitMHS family transport citrate in complex with a metal ion. Different members of the family are specific for the metal ion in the complex and have been shown to transport Mg(2+)-citrate, Ca(2+)-citrate or Fe(3+)-citrate. The Fe(3+)-citrate transporter of Streptococcus mutans clusters on the phylogenetic tree on a separate branch with a group of transporters found in the phylum Firmicutes which are believed to be involved in anaerobic citrate degradation. We have cloned and characterized the transporter from Enterococcus faecalis EfCitH in this cluster. The gene was functionally expressed in Escherichia coli and studied using right-side-out membrane vesicles. The transporter catalyzes proton-motive-force-driven uptake of the Ca(2+)-citrate complex with an affinity constant of 3.5 microm. Homologous exchange is catalyzed with a higher efficiency than efflux down a concentration gradient. Analysis of the metal ion specificity of EfCitH activity in right-side-out membrane vesicles revealed a specificity that was highly similar to that of the Bacillus subtilis Ca(2+)-citrate transporter in the same family. In spite of the high sequence identity with the S. mutans Fe(3+)-citrate transporter, no transport activity with Fe(3+) (or Fe(2+)) could be detected. The transporter of E. faecalis catalyzes translocation of citrate in complex with Ca(2+), Sr(2+), Mn(2+), Cd(2+) and Pb(2+) and not with Mg(2+), Zn(2+), Ni(2+) and Co(2+). The specificity appears to correlate with the size of the metal ion in the complex.
TI  - Functional analysis of AtlA, the major N-acetylglucosaminidase of Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - The major peptidoglycan hydrolase of Enterococcus faecalis, AtlA, has been identified, but its enzyme activity remains unknown. We have used tandem mass spectrometry analysis of peptidoglycan hydrolysis products obtained using the purified protein to show that AtlA is an N-acetylglucosaminidase. To gain insight into the regulation of its enzyme activity, the three domains of AtlA were purified alone or in combination following expression of truncated forms of the atlA gene in Escherichia coli or partial digestion of AtlA by proteinase K. The central domain of AtlA was catalytically active, but its activity was more than two orders of magnitude lower than that of the complete protein. Partial proteolysis of AtlA was detected in vivo: zymograms of E. faecalis extracts revealed two catalytically active protein bands of 62 and 72 kDa that were both absent in extracts from an atlA null mutant. Limited digestion of AtlA by proteinase K in vitro suggested that the proteolytic cleavage of AtlA in E. faecalis extracts corresponds to the truncation of the N-terminal domain, which is rich in threonine and glutamic acid residues. We show that the truncation of the N-terminal domain from recombinant AtlA has no impact on enzyme activity. The C-terminal domain of the protein, which contains six LysM modules bound to highly purified peptidoglycan, was required for optimal enzyme activity. These data indicate that AtlA is not produced as a proenzyme and that control of the AtlA glucosaminidase activity is likely to occur at the level of LysM-mediated binding to peptidoglycan.
TI  - Comparative stability and growth requirements of S. aureus and faecal indicator bacteria in seawater.
AB  - The fate (stability, multiplication) of S. aureus, E. coli and E. faecalis was determined in three classes of recreational waters (seawater, estuarine, stream) supplemented with nutrients in the form of sewage and peptone. In the absence of sunlight (24 +/- 2 degrees C), all bacteria in all water samples did not multiply and were slowly (days) inactivated. When 50% sewage was added to all water samples, E. coli and E. faecalis multiplied but S. aureus did not. When peptone (0.05%, 0.5%) was the added nutrient, the three bacteria multiplied. In the presence of sunlight (15-27 degrees C), S. aureus was inactivated rapidly (hours) in all water samples. These results show that when their nutritional requirements are met, S. aureus, E. coli and E. faecalis can multiply in the high salinity conditions of seawater. However, under environmental conditions, sunlight is an effective natural bactericidal agent.
TI  - The gene cluster for agmatine catabolism of Enterococcus faecalis: study of recombinant putrescine transcarbamylase and agmatine deiminase and a snapshot of agmatine deiminase catalyzing its reaction.
AB  - Enterococcus faecalis makes ATP from agmatine in three steps catalyzed by agmatine deiminase (AgDI), putrescine transcarbamylase (PTC), and carbamate kinase (CK). An antiporter exchanges putrescine for agmatine. We have cloned the E. faecalis ef0732 and ef0734 genes of the reported gene cluster for agmatine catabolism, overexpressed them in Escherichia coli, purified the products, characterized them functionally as PTC and AgDI, and crystallized and X-ray diffracted them. The 1.65-Angstroms-resolution structure of AgDI forming a covalent adduct with an agmatine-derived amidine reactional intermediate is described. We provide definitive identification of the gene cluster for agmatine catabolism and confirm that ornithine is a genuine but poor PTC substrate, suggesting that PTC (found here to be trimeric) evolved from ornithine transcarbamylase. N-(Phosphonoacetyl)-putrescine was prepared and shown to strongly (K(i) = 10 nM) and selectively inhibit PTC and to improve PTC crystallization. We find that E. faecalis AgDI, which is committed to ATP generation, closely resembles the AgDIs involved in making polyamines, suggesting the recruitment of a polyamine-synthesizing AgDI into the AgDI pathway. The arginine deiminase (ADI) pathway of arginine catabolism probably supplied the genes for PTC and CK but not those for the agmatine/putrescine antiporter, and thus the AgDI and ADI pathways are not related by a single "en bloc" duplication event. The AgDI crystal structure reveals a tetramer with a five-blade propeller subunit fold, proves that AgDI closely resembles ADI despite a lack of sequence identity, and explains substrate affinity, selectivity, and Cys357-mediated-covalent catalysis. A three-tongued agmatine-triggered gating opens or blocks access to the active center.
TI  - [Towards new antibacterial drugs. Interest of para-guanidinoethylcalix[4]arene].
AB  - We present here the results concerning the antibacterial properties evaluation of para-guanidinoethylcalix[4]arene, compared with its constitutive monomer, the para-guanidinoethylphenol, and hexamidine (Hexomedine), an antiseptic from the diamidine family widely used in therapeutic, chosen as a reference in this study for its resemblance in terms of functional groups. Antibacterial activities of those three compounds were evaluated by microdilution methods, in Mueller Hinton broth, onto 5 bacterial strains: Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 & ATCC 29213 and Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, according to CA-SFM and CLSI (formerly NCCLS) approved standards. In parallel, the effects of these three compounds on MRC-5 eukaryotic cell viability were evaluated with MTT assay. The results obtained here confirm a lack of activity for the monomer compound (MIC> or =512 mg/l) and a real antibacterial activity for the calixarene, comparable to hexamidine. This activity is expressed, both on Gram+and Gram- bacteria (MIC=4 mg/l for E. coli, 8 mg/l on both S. aureus strains) and at a lesser degree on E. faecalis and P. aeruginosa (MIC=32 mg/l). Similarly, both compounds, monomer and calixarene, slightly induce any modification on MRC-5 cells viability, and this until 168 h of treatment for concentrations reaching 10(-4) mol/L while hexamidine demonstrates a significant and increasing effect during the time of experiment and this for 100 to 1000 times lower concentrations. Thus, this study tends to confirm the significance of the organization of the para-guanidinoethylphenol monomer into its cyclic calixarenic tetramer for the gain of an antibacterial activity, similar to a widely used antiseptic one.
TI  - Etiological agents of dairy cows' mastitis in western part of Poland.
AB  - The purpose of the study was to determine the etiological mastitis agents in cows from herds located in the western part of Poland in years 2003-2005. Bacteriological examinations of 18,713 samples taken from California Mastitis Test (CMT) positive quarters were performed according to standard methods. Some Gram-negative bacilli and Gram-positive cocci were examined with the use of API tests (Analytical Profile Index). It was found that 32.7% of samples that were CMT positive were culture negative and 9.3% of samples were contaminated. Streptococcus species (15.7%), coagulase negative staphylococci (CNS) (14.6%), Staph. aureus (8.6%), Gram-negative bacilli (4.0%) and Corynebacterium species (3.8%) were most frequently isolated. Escherichia coli (52.3%) dominated among Gram-negative bacilli followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (4.1%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (3.6%), Enterobacter cloacae (3.6%), Serratia marcescens (3.1%), Pasteurella multocida (3.1%), Acinetobacter lwofii (3.1%), and 26 other bacteria species. Stahylococcus xylosus (31.5%), Staph. hyicus (12.2%), Staph. haemolyticus (12.2%), Staph. sciuri (11.6%), Staph. chromogenes (8.8%), Staph. epidermidis (8.3%) and Staph. simulans (6.1%) were the most frequent CNS. Streptococcus uberis (50%), Str. dysgalactiae (19.7%), Str. acidominimus (6.6%) and Enterococcus faecalis (5.3%) were mostly found among CAMP-negative streptococci. An increase in frequency of mastitis caused by non-agalactiae streptococci, Staph. aureus, A. pyogenes and yeast-like fungi and a decrease in that produced by Str. agalactiae in 2005 as compared to years 2003 or 2004 were observed.
TI  - Comparative evaluation of antimicrobial action of MTA, calcium hydroxide and Portland cement.
AB  - The present study aimed to evaluate and compare the antimicrobial effect of MTA Dentsply, MTA Angelus, Calcium Hydroxide and Portland cement. Four reference bacterial strains were used: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Bacteroides fragilis, and Enterococcus faecalis. Plates containing Mueller-Hinton agar supplemented with 5% sheep blood, hemin, and menadione were inoculated with the bacterial suspensions. Subsequently, wells were prepared and immediately filled with materials and incubated at 37 degrees C for 48 hours under anaerobic conditions, except P. aeruginosa. The diameters of inhibition zones were measured, and data analyzed using ANOVA and the Tukey test with 1% level of significance. MTA Dentsply, MTA Angelus and Portland cement inhibited the growth of P. aeruginosa. Calcium Hydroxide was effective against P. aeruginosa and B. fragillis. Under anaerobic conditions, which may hamper the formation of reactive oxygen species, the materials failed to inhibit E. faecalis, and E. coli.
TI  - In vitro activities of three carbapenems against recent bacterial isolates from severely ill patients at Swedish hospitals.
AB  - To study the in vitro activity of imipenem, meropenem and ertapenem against common pathogens isolated from patients in intensive care, haematology and dialysis/nephrology units at 7 Swedish university hospitals, a total of 788 isolates were collected during 2002-2003. The distribution of the isolates was as follows: Escherichia coli (n = 140), Klebsiella spp. (n = 132), Proteus spp. (n = 97), Enterobacter spp. (n = 113), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 126), Acinetobacter spp. (n = 53) and Enterococcus faecalis (n = 127). The susceptibility to the 3 carbapenems was determined by E-test, and the MICs were interpreted according to SRGA criteria. All 3 carbapenems were highly active against Enterobacteriaceae. The overall susceptibility to imipenem, meropenem and ertapenem was 90%, 98% and 93%, respectively. Against Enterobacteriaceae, Enterobacter spp. excluded, ertapenem had an equal or lower MIC(90) than meropenem. Apart from being the most active carbapenem against Enterobacteriaceae, meropenem was also the most active carbapenem against P. aeruginosa, whereas imipenem was the most active drug against Acinetobacter spp. The carbapenems are still potent antibiotics. With the introduction of ertapenem, and an expected increase in the carbapenem consumption due to an increased prevalence of strains with extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, continuous surveillance of carbapenem resistance appears to be warranted, with special attention to P. aeruginosa, Enterobacter and Proteus spp.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility among pathogens collected from hospitalized patients in the United States and in vitro activity of tigecycline, a new glycylcycline antimicrobial.
AB  - The activities of tigecycline and comparators against isolates collected from 76  U.S. centers between January 2004 and September 2005 were assessed. Tigecycline MIC(90)s were < or =2 microg/ml for Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, and Streptococcus agalactiae.
TI  - Pyrazolidine-3,5-diones and 5-hydroxy-1H-pyrazol-3(2H)-ones, inhibitors of UDP-N-acetylenolpyruvyl glucosamine reductase.
AB  - A series of pyrazolidine-3,5-dione and 5-hydroxy-1H-pyrazol-3(2H)-one inhibitors  of Escherichia coli UDP-N-acetylenolpyruvyl glucosamine reductase (MurB) has been prepared. The 5-hydroxy-1H-pyrazol-3(2H)-ones show low micromolar IC(50) values versus E. coli MurB and submicromolar minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) against Staphylococcus aureus GC 1131, Enterococcus faecalis GC 2242, Streptococcus pneumoniae GC 1894, and E. coli GC 4560 imp, a strain with increased outer membrane permeability. None of these compounds show antimicrobial activity against Candida albicans, a marker of eukaryotic toxicity. Moreover, these compounds inhibit peptidoglycan biosynthesis, as assessed by measuring the amount of soluble peptidoglycan produced by Streptococcus epidermidis upon incubation with compounds. A partial least squares projection to latent structures analysis shows that improving MurB potency and MIC values correlate with increasing lipophilicity of the C-4 substituent of the 5-hydroxy-1H-pyrazol-3(2H)-one core. Docking studies using FLO and PharmDock produced several binding orientations for these molecules in the MurB active site.
TI  - Activity of Brassica oleracea leaf juice on foodborne pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - Many vegetables of the Cruciferae family have been found to possess antimicrobial properties against several microorganisms of clinical importance. In this study, we reported the antibacterial effect of Brassica oleracea juice on several food-borne pathogens. The juice was found to be effective in inhibiting the growth of Salmonella Enteritidis, verotoxigenic Escherichia coli O157:H7, E. coli HB producing thermolabile toxin, nontoxigenic E. coli, and Listeria monocytogenes, but not Enterococcus faecalis. All cauliflower cultivars tested suppressed bacterial growth in a dose-dependent manner after 5 h of treatments, and the reduction in the number of viable cells ranged from 1 log with a 10% juice concentration to more than 3 log with a 20% juice concentration. The foodborne bacteria tested were also markedly reduced by isothiocyanates, natural components abundant in the genus Brassica, indicating that glucosinolate-derived isothiocyanates can play a major role in the antimicrobial activity of cauliflower. The antimicrobial effect of juice was reduced in presence of cysteine, suggesting that one mechanism of action of the juice involves blocking bacterial sulfhydryl groups.
TI  - Evaluation of the hygienic quality and associated public health hazards of raw milk marketed by smallholder dairy producers in the Dar es Salaam region, Tanzania.
AB  - A cross-sectional study was conducted to determine three parameters of the quality of the raw milk marketed by milk selling points (MSPs) in Dar es Salaam region. Total bacterial count (TBC) was used as an indicator of the microbial quality of the milk; antimicrobial residues were determined; and the California mastitis test (CMT) was used to screen for milk somatic cells as an indication of the mastitis level in the cows that provided the milk. Moreover, a water sample at each MSP was taken for bacteriological culturing. Finally, a questionnaire survey was conducted with the milk sellers at the MSPs to identify risk factors for poor milk hygiene. A total of 128 milk samples and corresponding water samples were collected from randomly selected milk selling points in Dar es Salaam region. The mean TBC was (8.2 +/- 1.9) x 10(6) cfu/ml, and major bacterial isolates from the milk samples were Escherichia coli (6.3%), Bacillus cereus (6.3%), Staphylococcus aureus (6.3%) and Streptococcus agalactiae (6.3%), Enterobacter aerogenes (5.6%) and Enterococcus faecalis (4.7%). In most cases, the organisms identified in milk corresponded to those isolated from the corresponding water samples. Of milk samples, 79.0% were positive to the CMT and 7.0% were positive for antimicrobial residues. TBC was normalized by log-transformation, and the possible predictors of TBC were identified by fitting two linear regression models. In a random effect model, water microbial quality, frequency of cleaning the milk containers, frequency of milk supply, milk storage time and the type of containers, and mixing of fresh and previous milk were significantly (p < 0.05) associated with the mean log TBC. In a fixed effect model, in addition to these indicators, water shortage, water source and the refrigerator condition were significantly (p < or = 0.01) associated with log TBC. It was concluded that the milk sold in Dar es Salaam region is of poor quality and is of public health significance.
TI  - FT-IR microspectroscopy for early identification of some clinically relevant pathogens.
AB  - AIMS: To investigate the potentials and limitations of Fourier transform-infrared (FT-IR) microspectroscopy as a tool to identify, at the level of microcolonies, pathogenic bacteria frequently isolated in the clinical environment. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 1570 FT-IR spectra from 164 gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria isolated from patients were recorded from 6 to 10-h old microcolonies of 50-150 microm size. A classification of 100% was obtained for the most frequent gram-positive bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, and Enterococcus faecium at the species level. An average accuracy of about 80% was reached with Gram negative bacteria from the Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonaceae families; Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella spp., and Citrobacter koseri; and Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli. Results were comparable with FT-IR measurements on dried suspensions from 18-h cultures. CONCLUSIONS: Early identification of young microcolonies is feasible with FT-IR microscopy with a very high accuracy for gram-positive bacteria. Some improvement in the transfer of microcolonies is necessary to increase the accuracy for gram-negative bacteria. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Combination of FT-IR microscopy and multivariate data analysis could be a complementary, rapid, and reliable tool for screening and discriminating, at species and subspecies level, micro-organisms of clinical, food-borne, or environmental origins.
TI  - Adverse effects of increased intra-abdominal pressure on small bowel structure and bacterial translocation in the rat.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of elevated intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) on intestinal structures and bacterial translocation in the rat. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-two male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into three experimental groups of 14 rats each: the sham group underwent insertion of a balloon-tipped catheter; the IAP-15 group was subjected to a 15 mm Hg pneumoperitoneum for 60 minutes; and the IAP-25 group was subjected to a 25 mm Hg pneumoperitoneum for 60 minutes. Intestinal structural changes (bowel circumference, overall bowel and mucosal weight, mucosal DNA and protein, villus height, and crypt depth) and bacterial translocation to mesenteric lymph nodes, liver, spleen, portal blood, and peripheral blood were determined 24 hours following pneumoperitoneum. RESULTS: IAP-15 and IAP-25 rats demonstrated a significant decrease in: bowel and mucosal weight in the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum; mucosal DNA and protein in the jejunum and ileum; villus height in the jejunum: and crypt depth in the jejunum and ileum compared to the sham rats. Bacterial translocation was demonstrated in 60% of IAP-15 rats and in 80% of IAP-25 rats. CONCLUSION: Elevated IAP results in mucosal injury of the gut, causing mucosal hypoplasia, and increases bacterial translocation.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance in the southeastern Mediterranean--preliminary results from the ARMed project.
AB  - Sporadic reports from centres in the south and east of the Mediterranean have suggested that the prevalence of antibiotic resistance in this region appears to be considerable, yet pan-regional studies using comparable methodology have been lacking in the past. Susceptibility test results from invasive isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecium and faecalis routinely recovered from clinical samples of blood and cerebrospinal fluid within participating laboratories situated in Algeria, Cyprus, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Malta, Morocco, Tunisia and Turkey were collected as part of the ARMed project. Preliminary data from the first two years of the project showed the prevalence of penicillin non-susceptibility in S. pneumoniae to range from 0% (Malta) to 36% (Algeria) [median: 29%] whilst methicillin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus varied from 10% in Lebanon to 65% in Jordan [median: 43%]. Significant country specific resistance in E. coli was also seen, with 72% of isolates from Egyptian hospitals reported to be resistant to third generation cephalosporins and 40% non-susceptible to fluoroquinolones in Turkey. Vancomycin non-susceptibility was only reported in 0.9% of E. faecalis isolates from Turkey and in 3.8% of E. faecium isolates from Cyprus. The preliminary results from the ARMed project appear to support previous sporadic reports suggesting high antibiotic resistance in the Mediterranean region. They suggest that this is particularly the case in the eastern Mediterranean region where resistance in S. aureus and E. coli seems to be higher than that reported in the other countries of the Mediterranean.
TI  - C-terminal WxL domain mediates cell wall binding in Enterococcus faecalis and other gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - Analysis of the genome sequence of Enterococcus faecalis clinical isolate V583 revealed novel genes encoding surface proteins. Twenty-seven of these proteins, annotated as having unknown functions, possess a putative N-terminal signal peptide and a conserved C-terminal region characterized by a novel conserved domain designated WxL. Proteins having similar characteristics were also detected in other low-G+C-content gram-positive bacteria. We hypothesized that the WxL region might be a determinant of bacterial cell location. This hypothesis was tested by generating protein fusions between the C-terminal regions of two WxL proteins in E. faecalis and a nuclease reporter protein. We demonstrated that the C-terminal regions of both proteins conferred a cell surface localization to the reporter fusions in E. faecalis. This localization was eliminated by introducing specific deletions into the domains. Interestingly, exogenously added protein fusions displayed binding to whole cells of various gram-positive bacteria. We also showed that the peptidoglycan was a binding ligand for WxL domain attachment to the cell surface and that neither proteins nor carbohydrates were necessary for binding. Based on our findings, we propose that the WxL region is a novel cell wall binding domain in E. faecalis and other gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of some unsymmetrical diorganyltellurium(IV) dichlorides.
AB  - Six unsymmetrical diorganyltellurium(IV) dichlorides RR'TeCl2 (where R= phenacyl-, 1-naphthacyl-, and styrylacyl- and R' = p-methoxyphenyl, p-hydroxyphenyl-, and 3-methyl-4-hydoxyphenyl-) were tested for their antibacterial activity against gram-positive (Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923) and gram-negative (Escherichia coli ATCC 25922. Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 and Salmonella sp.) bacteria. Antibacterial activity was measured by disk diffusion method. Inhibition zones demonstrated that all the compounds showed good activity against gram-negative strains. Phenacyl (3-methyl-4-hydroxyphenyl) tellurium(IV) dichloride and naphthacyl (3-methyl-4-hydroxyphenyl) tellurium(IV) dichloride showed significant activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative strains. Among the tested compounds, the former exhibited maximum activity against gram-positive bacteria, while the latter against all the bacteria under study and styrylacyl (p-methoxyphenyl) tellurium(IV) dichloride against all the three gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of crude methanolic extract and its fractions of aerial parts of Anthemis tinctoria.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of the methanolic extract and its fractions of aerial  parts of Aniheinis tinctoria (Asteraceae) was investigated against representative gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923) and Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29212) and gram-negative strains Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853). The activity was concentrated mainly in the dichloromethane (DCM) and hexane fractions of crude methanolic extract. The 5 mg of DCM extract per disk produced 15-16 mm of inhibition zone against S. aureus and P. aeruginosa, however, no activity was found against E. faecalis and E. coli. The hexane fraction showed activity against S. aureus, P. aeruginosa and E. faecalis. As DCM fraction showed the highest antibacterial activity in the disk diffusion assay, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) values of only this fraction was determined against S. aureus and P. aeruginosa. These values were found to be in the range of 1.25 to 10 mg/ml.
TI  - Effective prevention of microbial biofilm formation on medical devices by low-energy surface acoustic waves.
AB  - Low-energy surface acoustic waves generated from electrically activated piezo elements are shown to effectively prevent microbial biofilm formation on indwelling medical devices. The development of biofilms by four different bacteria and Candida species is prevented when such elastic waves with amplitudes in the nanometer range are applied. Acoustic-wave-activated Foley catheters have all their surfaces vibrating with longitudinal and transversal dispersion vectors homogeneously surrounding the catheter surfaces. The acoustic waves at the surface are repulsive to bacteria and interfere with the docking and attachment of planktonic microorganisms to solid surfaces that constitute the initial phases of microbial biofilm development. FimH-mediated adhesion of uropathogenic Escherichia coli to guinea pig erythrocytes was prevented at power densities below thresholds that activate bacterial force sensor mechanisms. Elevated power densities dramatically enhanced red blood cell aggregation. We inserted Foley urinary catheters attached with elastic-wave-generating actuators into the urinary tracts of male rabbits. The treatment with the elastic acoustic waves maintained urine sterility for up to 9 days compared to 2 days in control catheterized animals. Scanning electron microscopy and bioburden analyses revealed diminished biofilm development on these catheters. The ability to prevent biofilm formation on indwelling devices and catheters can benefit the implanted medical device industry.
TI  - Gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase-glutathione synthetase: domain structure and identification of residues important in substrate and glutathione binding.
AB  - In most organisms, glutathione (GSH) is synthesized by the sequential action of distinct enzymes, gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase (gamma-GCS) and GSH synthetase (GS). In Streptococcus agalactiae, GSH synthesis is catalyzed by a single enzyme, gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase-glutathione synthetase (gamma-GCS-GS). The N-terminal sequence of gamma-GCS-GS is similar to Escherichia coli gamma-GCS, but the C-terminal sequence is an ATP-grasp domain more similar to d-Ala, d-Ala ligase than to any known GS. In the present studies, C-terminally and N-terminally truncated constructs were characterized in order to define the limits of the gamma-GCS and GS domains, respectively. Although WT gamma-GCS-GS is nearly uninhibited by GSH (K(i) approximately 140 mM), shorter gamma-GCS domain constructs were unexpectedly found to be strongly inhibited (K(i) approximately 15 mM), reproducing a physiologically important regulation seen in monofunctional gamma-GCS enzymes. Because studies with E. coli gamma-GCS implicate a flexible loop region in GSH binding, chimeras of S. agalactiae gamma-GCS-GS were made containing gamma-GCS domain flexible loop sequences from Enterococcus faecalis and Pasteurella multocida gamma-GCS-GS, isoforms that are inhibited by GSH. Inhibition remained S. agalactiae-like (i.e., very weak). C-Terminal constructs of gamma-GCS-GS have GS activity (0.01-0.04% of WT), but proper folding and significant GS activity required a covalently linked gamma-GCS domain. In addition, site-directed mutants in the middle region of the gamma-GCS-GS sequence established that GS activity depends on residues in a region that is also part of the gamma-GCS domain. Our results provide new insights into the structure of gamma-GCS-GS and suggest gamma-GCS-GS evolved from a monomeric gamma-GCS that became C-terminally fused to a multimeric ATP-grasp protein.
TI  - 1H NMR spectroscopy in the diagnosis of Klebsiella pneumoniae-induced urinary tract infection.
AB  - The (1)H NMR spectroscopic method is suggested and its utility is demonstrated for the diagnosis of Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) in urinary tract infection (UTI). K. pneumoniae have the specific property of metabolizing glycerol to 1,3-propanediol (1,3-PD), acetate, ethanol and succinate. The quantity of 1,3-PD produced correlates well with the viable bacterial count. Other common bacteria causing UTI (except for Citrobacter frundii), such as Escherichia coli (E. coli), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa), Enterobacter aerogenes, Acinetobacter baumanii, Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus gp B and Staphylococcus aureus do not metabolize glycerol under similar conditions. Citrobacter frundii (C. frundii) also gives the same NMR results but is easily differentiated as being motile on direct microscopic examination of urine and it is not common nosocomial infectious agent in urinary tract infection. The method provides a single-step documentation of K. pneumoniae (and C. frundii) qualitatively as well as quantitatively. Out of the total 614 subjects considered, clinical diagnosis of UTI was obtained in 516 cases (84%). The NMR-based screening had a sensitivity of 90%, a specificity of 100% and a false negativity of 10% relative to the conventional quantitative culture method. In the present authors' experience, the results of NMR spectroscopy based screening show a very good correlation with the diagnosis of urinary tract infected patients.
TI  - Synthesis and properties of benzo[a]phenoxazinium chalcogen analogues as novel broad-spectrum antimicrobial photosensitizers.
AB  - The goal of this investigation was to develop improved photosensitizers for use as antimicrobial drugs in photodynamic therapy of localized infections. Replacement of the oxygen atom in 5-(ethylamino)-9-diethylaminobenzo[a]phenoxazinium chloride (1) with sulfur and selenium afforded thiazinium and selenazinium analogues 2 and 3, respectively. All three dyes are water soluble, lipophilic, and red light absorbers. The relative photodynamic activities of the chalcogen series were evaluated against a panel of prototypical pathogenic microorganisms: the Gram-positive Enterococcus faecalis, the Gram-negative Escherichia coli, and the fungus Candida albicans. Selenium dye 3 was highly effective as a broad-spectrum antimicrobial photosensitizer with fluences of 4-32 J/cm2 killing 2-5 more logs of all cell types than sulfur dye 2, which was slightly more effective than oxygen analogue 1. These data, taken with the findings of uptake and retention studies, suggest that the superior activity of selenium derivative 3 can be attributed to its much higher triplet quantum yield.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (2004) II. Background of patients].
AB  - Six hundred six bacterial strains isolated from 490 patients diagnosed as having  urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 14 institutions in Japan were collected between August 2004 and July 2005. The frequency of bacteria isolation stratified with patient clinical background was compared. The clinical background investigated included sex, age, type of infections, timing of antibiotics administration, and presence or absence of surgery affecting a decrease in defense against infection. The bacterial strains were stratified with the age and sex of the patients and the types of infections. In males, the number of patients aged less than 60 years was few and the complicated UTIs without indwelling catheter was observed most frequently. In females, the number of patients aged less than 60 years was comparatively more than in males. In all of ages except 0-19 and > or = 80 years, the ratio of the uncomplicated UTIs was high, accounting for 44.1-90.0% of all types of infections. In the present time, the bacteria most frequently isolated were Escherichia coli. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus faecalis also were relatively frequently isolated. E. coli most frequently isolated with the uncomplicated UTIs and P. aeruginosa and E. faecalis most frequently isolated with the complicated UTIs. With respect to the relation of these results to the age of the patients, in the uncomplicated UTIs, the isolation frequency of E. coli was the highest in all age groups except 0-19 years, accounting for 50% or higher. In the complicated UTIs without indwelling catheter, the isolation frequency of E. coli tended to be high in all age groups. In the complicated UTIs with indwelling catheter, P. aeruginosa were more frequently isolated. In comparison of causative bacteria in UTIs between before and after the administration of antibiotics, P. aeruginosa increased after the administration in any types of UTIs. In comparison of causative bacteria in UTIs with or without surgery, E. coli was more frequently isolated in the patients without surgery, while P. aeruginosa and E. faecalis were more frequently isolated in the patients with surgery in any UTIs.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (2004). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The bacterial strains isolated from 490 patients diagnosed as having urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 14 institutions in Japan were collected between August 2004 and July 2005. The susceptibilities of them to many kinds of antimicrobial agents were measured. Of them, 577 strains were estimated as causative bacteria and used for the measurement. The strains consisted of 156 gram-positive bacterial strains (27.0%) and 421 gram-negative bacterial strains (73.0%). Against Staphylococcus aureus, arbekacin (ABK), vancomycin (VCM) showed the strongest activity and prevented the growth of all strains with 2 microg/mL. Against Enterococcus faecalis, ampicillin (ABPC) and VCM showed a strong antibacterial activity. The antibacterial activity of cephems to Escherichia coli was generally good, and especially cefozopran (CZOP) and cefpirome (CPR) showed the strongest activity (MIC90: < or = 125 microg/mL). Quinolone resistant E. coli [MIC of ciprofloxacin (CPFX): > or = 4 microg/mL] was detected at frequency of 18.8%, which was higher than that in the last year. Against Klebsiella pneumoniae, CZOP, meropenem (MEPM), and carumonam (CRMN) showed the strongest activity and prevented the growth of all strains with 0.125 microg/mL or less. The antibacterial activity of the other cephems was relatively good, and decrease in their activity observed in the last year study was not recognized. Against Serratia marcescens, imipenem (IPM) and gentamicin (GM) had the strongest antibacterial activity. Against Proteus mirabilis, CRMN showed the strongest activity and prevented the growth of all strains with 0.125 microg/mL or less. MEPM prevented the growth of all strains with 0.25 microg/mL. Next, cefmenoxime (CMX), ceftazidime (CAZ), CZOP, cefixime (CFIX), cefpodoxime (CPDX), and cefditoren (CDTR) showed a strong activity. The antibacterial activity of the drugs to Pseudomonas aeruginosa was generally low, and MIC90 of all the drugs was ranged from 32 to > 128 microg/mL except IPM and MEPM having 16 microg/mL. The antibacterial activities of CZOP and CAZ were considered to be relatively good on MIC50 comparison (MIC50: 2 microg/mL).
TI  - G-CSF-mediated inhibition of JNK is a key mechanism for Lactobacillus rhamnosus-induced suppression of TNF production in macrophages.
AB  - Lactobacillus rhamnosus is a human commensal with known immunomodulatory properties. To date the mechanism of these immunomodulatory effects is not well understood. To unravel the immunomodulatory signalling mechanism, we investigated the effects of two strains of L. rhamnosus, L. rhamnosus GG and GR-1, in modulating production of tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) in human monocytic cell line THP-1 and mouse macrophages. Live L. rhamnosus GG and GR-1 or their spent culture supernatant induced minuscule amounts of TNF production but large quantities of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) in macrophages compared with those induced by pathogenic Escherichia coli GR-12 and Enterococcus faecalis. By using neutralizing antibodies and G-CSF receptor knockout mice, we demonstrated that G-CSF secreted from L. rhamnosus GG- and GR-1-exposed macrophages suppressed TNF production induced by E. coli- or lipopolysaccharide-activated macrophages through a paracrine route. The suppression of TNF production by G-CSF was mediated through activation of STAT3 and subsequent inhibition of c-Jun-N-terminal kinases (JNKs). The inhibition of JNK activation required STAT3alpha-mediated de novo protein synthesis. This demonstrates a novel role of G-CSF in L. rhamnosus-triggered anti-inflammatory effects and its mechanism in the suppression of TNF production in macrophages.
TI  - The cathelicidin-derived tritrpticin enhances the efficacy of ertapenem in experimental rat models of septic shock.
AB  - Sepsis remains a serious clinical problem despite intense efforts to improve survival. In this study, the efficacy of ertapenem combined with the cathelicidin tritrpticin was investigated in two rat models of septic shock. Main outcome measures were bacterial growth in blood, peritoneum, spleen, liver, and mesenteric lymph nodes; endotoxin, interleukin 6, and tumor necrosis factor alpha concentrations in plasma; and lethality. Adult male Wistar rats were given (1) an intraperitoneal injection of 1 mg Escherichia coli serotype 0111:B4 LPS or (2) intra-abdominal sepsis induced via cecal ligation and puncture. For each model, all animals were randomized to receive intraperitoneally isotonic sodium chloride solution, 1 mg/kg tritrpticin, 15 mg/kg ertapenem, and 1 mg/kg tritrpticin combined with 15 mg/kg ertapenem. Each group included 20 animals. All compounds significantly reduced bacterial growth and lethality as compared with saline treatment. Treatment with tritrpticin resulted in significant decrease in plasma endotoxin and cytokine levels, whereas ertapenem exerted opposite effect. The combination between tritrpticin and ertapenem proved to be the most effective treatment in reducing all variables measured. In conclusion, tritrpticin enhances ertapenem efficacy in gram-negative septic shock rat models.
TI  - Composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oil of Dicyclophora persica Boiss. from Iran.
AB  - The chemical composition of the essential oil of Dicyclophora persica Boiss. was  identified by GC and GC-MS analysis. The analysis of the oil resulted in the identification of forty-five components constituting 98.6% of the total oil. The main constituents were a-pinene (31.5%), (Z)-beta-ocimene (23.3%), p-cymene (6.7%) and (E)-beta-ocimene (5.4%). The antimicrobial activity of the oil was tested by the disk diffusion method against four Gram-positive (Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis) and three Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) bacteria together with a fungus (Aspergillus niger). The oil showed strong inhibition activity toward all the tested microorganisms except for Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Antibacterial and cytotoxic activity of Brazilian plant extracts--Clusiaceae.
AB  - Twelve extracts obtained from nine plants belonging to six different genera of Clusiaceae were analyzed against Gram-negative (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis) bacteria using the microdilution broth assay. Tovomita aff. longifolia, T. brasiliensis, Clusia columnaris, Garcinia madruno, Haploclathra paniculata, and Caraipa grandifolia extracts showed significant results against the bacteria. The organic extract obtained from the leaves of T. aff. longifolia showed minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) = 70 microg/ml and minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) = 90 microg/ml against E. faecalis and the organic extract made with the stem of C. columnaris showed MIC = 180 microg/ml and MBC = 270 microg/ml against P. aeruginosa. None of the antibacterial extracts showed lethal activity against brine shrimp nauplii. On the other hand, both aqueous and organic extracts obtained from the aerial organs of Vismia guianensis that were cytotoxic to brine shrimp nauplii did not show a significant antibacterial activity in the assay.
TI  - Isolation of bacteriocinogenic Lactobacillus plantarum strains from ben saalga, a traditional fermented gruel from Burkina Faso.
AB  - A collection of lactic acid bacteria isolated from ben saalga, a traditional fermented gruel from Burkina Faso, was screened for bacteriocin production. Seven isolates were selected for their broad antimicrobial spectra, which overall included strains of Bacillus cereus, Bacillus licheniformis, Enterococcus faecalis, Listeria innocua, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica. Cluster analysis of RAPD-PCR patterns revealed that six of the isolates represent different strains. The six selected strains were identified as Lactobacillus plantarum by 16S rDNA sequencing, species-specific PCR and multiplex PCR of the recA gene. PCR amplification revealed the presence of genes of the plantaricin cluster described in L. plantarum C11. Among them, strain 5.2.2 carried the largest number of genes from this cluster.
TI  - Microbial drug efflux proteins of the major facilitator superfamily.
AB  - Drug efflux proteins are widespread amongst microorganisms, including pathogens.  They can contribute to both natural insensitivity to antibiotics and to emerging antibiotic resistance and so are potential targets for the development of new antibacterial drugs. The design of such drugs would be greatly facilitated by knowledge of the structures of these transport proteins, which are poorly understood, because of the difficulties of obtaining crystals of quality. We describe a structural genomics approach for the amplified expression, purification and characterisation of prokaryotic drug efflux proteins of the 'Major Facilitator Superfamily' (MFS) of transport proteins from Helicobacter pylori, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis, Brucella melitensis, Campylobacter jejuni, Neisseria meningitides and Streptomyces coelicolor. The H. pylori putative drug resistance protein, HP1092, and the S. aureus QacA proteins are used as detailed examples. This strategy is an important step towards reproducible production of transport proteins for the screening of drug binding and for optimisation of crystallisation conditions to enable subsequent structure determination.
TI  - Automated detection and quantitation of bacterial RNA by using electrical microarrays.
AB  - Low-density electrical 16S rRNA specific oligonucleotide microarrays and an automated analysis system have been developed for the identification and quantitation of pathogens. The pathogens are Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis, which are typically involved in urinary tract infections. Interdigitated gold array electrodes (IDA-electrodes), which have structures in the nanometer range, have been used for very sensitive analysis. Thiol-modified oligonucleotides are immobilized on the gold IDA as capture probes. They mediate the specific recognition of the target 16S rRNA by hybridization. Additionally three unlabeled oligonucleotides are hybridized in close proximity to the capturing site. They are supporting molecules, because they improve the RNA hybridization at the capturing site. A biotin labeled detector oligonucleotide is also allowed to hybridize to the captured RNA sequence. The biotin labels enable the binding of avidin alkaline phophatase conjugates. The phosphatase liberates the electrochemical mediator p-aminophenol from its electrically inactive phosphate derivative. The electrical signals were generated by amperometric redox cycling and detected by a unique multipotentiostat. The read out signals of the microarray are position specific current and change over time in proportion to the analyte concentration. If two additional biotins are introduced into the affinity binding complex via the supporting oligonucleotides, the sensitivity of the assays increase more than 60%. The limit of detection of Escherichia coli total RNA has been determined to be 0.5 ng/microL. The control of fluidics for variable assay formats as well as the multichannel electrical read out and data handling have all been fully automated. The fast and easy procedure does not require any amplification of the targeted nucleic acids by PCR.
TI  - Coenzyme Q10 production in recombinant Escherichia coli strains engineered with a heterologous decaprenyl diphosphate synthase gene and foreign mevalonate pathway.
AB  - In the present work, Escherichia coli DH5alpha was metabolically engineered for CoQ(10) production by the introduction of decaprenyl diphosphate synthase gene (ddsA) from Agrobacterium tumefaciens. Grown in 2YTG medium (1.6% tryptone, 1% yeast extract, 0.5% NaCl, and 0.5% glycerol) with an initial pH of 7, the recombinant E. coli was capable of CoQ(10) production up to 470 microg/gDCW (dry cell weight). This value could be further elevated to 900 microg/gDCW simply by increasing the initial culture pH from 7 to 9. Supplementation of 4-hydroxy benzoate did not improve the productivity any further. However, engineering of a lower mevalonate semi-pathway so as to increase the isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) supply of the recombinant strain using exogenous mevalonate efficiently increased the CoQ(10) production. Lower mevalonate semi-pathways of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae were tested. Among these, the pathway of Streptococcus pneumoniae proved to be superior, yielding CoQ(10) production of 2,700+/-115 microg/gDCW when supplemented with exogenous mevalonate of 3 mM. In order to construct a complete mevalonate pathway, the upper semi-pathway of the same bacterium, Streptococcus pneumoniae, was recruited. In a recombinant E. coli DH5alpha harboring three plasmids encoding for upper and lower mevalonate semi-pathways as well as DdsA enzyme, the heterologous mevalonate pathway could convert endogenous acetyl-CoA to IPP, resulting in CoQ(10) production of up to 2,428+/-75 microg/gDCW, without mevalonate supplementation. In contrast, a whole mevalonate pathway constructed in a single operon was found to be less efficient. However, it provided CoQ(10) production of up to 1,706+/-86 microg/gDCW, which was roughly 1.9 times higher than that obtained by ddsA alone.
TI  - Triterpenoid saponins from the fruits of Caryocar villosum.
AB  - Fourteen new triterpenoid saponins (1-14) were isolated from the methanol extract of the fruits of Caryocar villosum along with 10 known saponins. Their structures were established on the basis of extensive NMR (1H, 13C, COSY, TOCSY, ROESY, HSQC, and HMBC) and ESIMS studies. The toxicity of the methanolic extracts of the peel and the pulp of fruits and the crude saponin fraction of the peel was assessed using the Artemia salina test. The antimicrobial activities of caryocarosides IV-21 (14), II-1 (16), III-1 (17), and IV-9 (20) and of saponin 23 were also studied in vitro on Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Mycobacterium smegmatis, and Enterococcus faecalis bacteria.
TI  - Capillary isoelectric focusing of microorganisms in the pH range 2-5 in a dynamically modified FS capillary with UV detection.
AB  - The isoelectric points of many microbial cells lie within the pH range spanning from 1.5 to 4.5. In this work, we suggest a CIEF method for the separation of cells according to their isoelectric points in the pH range of 2-5. It includes the segmental injection of the sample pulse composed of the segment of the selected simple ampholytes, the segment of the bioanalytes and the segment of carrier ampholytes into fused silica capillaries dynamically modified by poly(ethylene glycole). This polymer dissolved in the catholyte, in the anolyte and in the injected sample pulse was used for a prevention of the bioanalyte adsorption on the capillary surface and for the reduction of the electroosmotic flow. Between each focusing run, the capillaries were washed with the mixture of acetone/ethanol to achieve the reproducible and efficient CIEF. In order to trace of pH gradients, low-molecular-mass pI markers were used. The mixed cultures of microorganisms, Escherichia coli CCM 3954, Candida albicans CCM 8180, Candida parapsilosis, Candida krusei, Candida glabrata, Candida tropicalis, CCM 8223, Proteus vulgaris, Klebsiela pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus CCM 3953, Streptococcus agalactiae CCM 6187, Enterococcus faecalis CCM 4224 and Staphylococcus epidermidis CCM 4418, were focused and separated by the CIEF method suggested here. This CIEF method enables the separation and detection of the microbes from the mixed cultures within several minutes. The minimum detectable number of microbial cells was less than 10(3).
TI  - Amphibian peptides prevent endotoxemia and bacterial translocation in bile duct-ligated rats.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the efficacy of amphibian antimicrobial peptides in preventing bacterial translocation and neutralizing endotoxins in bile duct-ligated rats. DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, controlled animal study. SETTING: Research laboratory in a university hospital. SUBJECTS: Adult male Wistar rats. INTERVENTIONS: Adult male Wistar rats underwent sham operation or bile duct ligation (BDL). Eight groups were studied: sham operation with saline treatment, sham operation with 120 mg/kg tazobactam-piperacillin, sham operation with 2 mg/kg uperin 3.6, sham operation with 2 mg/kg magainin2, BDL with saline treatment, BDL with 120 mg/kg tazobactam-piperacillin, BDL with 2 mg/kg uperin 3.6, and BDL with 2 mg/kg magainin2. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Main outcome measures were: endotoxin and tumor necrosis factor-alpha concentrations in plasma and evidence of bacterial translocation in blood, peritoneum, liver, and mesenteric lymph nodes. Endotoxin and tumor necrosis factor-alpha plasma levels were significantly higher in BDL rats compared with sham-operated animals. All amphibian peptides achieved a significant reduction of plasma endotoxin and tumor necrosis factor-alpha concentration when compared with saline- and tazobactam-piperacillin-treated groups. On the other hand, both tazobactam-piperacillin and peptides significantly reduced bacterial growth compared with the control. Tazobactam-piperacillin and magainin2 exerted the maximal inhibition of bacterial growth. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, because of their multifunctional properties, amphibian peptides could be interesting compounds to inhibit bacterial translocation and endotoxin release in obstructive jaundice.
TI  - Broad-spectrum microbicidal activity, toxicologic assessment, and materials compatibility of a new generation of accelerated hydrogen peroxide-based environmental surface disinfectant.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Concerns on human and environmental safety and label claims of many microbicides point to the need for safer, faster acting, and broad-spectrum substitutes. ACCEL TB, a 0.5% accelerated H(2)O(2) (AHP)-based disinfectant described here, is a potential candidate. METHODS: ACCEL TB was tested for its broad-spectrum microbicidal activity, safety and materials compatibility using internationally accepted protocols. Activity against bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and Salmonella choleraesuis) was tested with the AOAC use-dilution method and the first tier of a quantitative carrier test (QCT-1). Mycobactericidal activity was tested against Mycobacterium bovis and Mycobacterium terrae using a quantitative suspension test (QST) and QCT-1, respectively. Fungicidal activity (Trichophyton mentagrophytes) was determined with the AOAC test and QCT-1. Activity against several enveloped and nonenveloped viruses was evaluated using the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) method No. E-1053. Sanitizing action was tested against 7 types of vegetative bacteria with method No. DIS/TSS-10. All microbicidal tests contained an added soil load; in all AOAC tests, it was 5% fetal bovine serum, and, in QCT-1, a mixture of 3 types of proteins in phosphate buffer was used instead. The methods to test for acute oral, dermal, inhalation toxicities, and dermal and eye irritation as well as skin sensitization complied with the requirements of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and the US Environmental Protection Agency (OPPTS 870). Standard methods were also used to test compatibility with metals and plastics. RESULTS: At 20 degrees C, the full-strength product was bactericidal and virucidal in 1 minute and mycobactericidal and fungicidal in 5 minutes. It was nonirritating to skin and eyes. The acute oral LD(50) (lethal dose 50%) was >5000 mg/kg. It was compatible with 12 types of plastic and 3 out of 4 metals. CONCLUSION: The tested formulation showed a high safety and materials compatibility profile in addition to being a fast acting, intermediate-level disinfectant.
TI  - Capillary isoelectric focusing of proteins and microorganisms in dynamically modified fused silica with UV detection.
AB  - We suggest a method for the reproducible and efficient capillary isoelectric focusing of proteins and microorganisms in the pH gradient 3-10. The method involves the segmental injection of the simple ampholytes, the solution of the selected electrolytes, and the sample mixture of bioanalytes and carrier ampholytes to the fused silica capillaries dynamically modified by poly(ethylene glycol), PEG 4000, which is added to the catholyte, the anolyte and injected solutions. In order to receive the reproducible results, the capillaries were rinsed by the mixture of acetone/ethanol between analyses. For the tracing of the pH gradients the low-molecular-mass pI markers were used. The simple proteins and the mixed cultures of microorganisms, Saccharomyces cerevisiae CCM 8191, Escherichia coli CCM 3954, Candida albicans CCM 8180, Candida parapsilosis, Candida krusei, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae CCM 6187, Enterococcus faecalis CCM 4224, Staphylococcus epidermidis CCM 4418 and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, were focused and separated by the method suggested. The minimum detectable number of microbial cells was 5x10(2) to 1x10(3) with on-column UV detection at 280 nm.
TI  - Cloning, purification, crystallization and preliminary crystallographic analysis  of SecA from Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - The gene coding for SecA from Enterococcus faecalis was cloned and overexpressed  in Escherichia coli. In this protein, the lysine at position 6 was replaced by an asparagine in order to reduce sensitivity towards proteases. The modified protein was purified and crystallized. Crystals diffracting to 2.4 A resolution were obtained using the vapour-diffusion technique. The crystals belong to the monoclinic space group C2, with unit-cell parameters a = 203.4, b = 49.8, c = 100.8 A, alpha = gamma = 90.0, beta = 119.1 degrees. A selenomethionine derivative was prepared and is currently being tested in crystallization trials.
TI  - Antimicrobial and toxicological profile of the new biocide Akacid plus.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Akacid plus is a new member of the polymeric guanidine family of disinfectants. It was especially developed to enhance the antimicrobial activity of this class with significantly less toxicity. The in vitro activity of Akacid plus compared with chlorhexidine digluconate and mupirocin was tested against a total of 369 recent clinical isolates. METHODS: The organisms tested by CLSI reference methods included the following: Staphylococcus aureus (98), Staphylococcus epidermidis (9), Bacillus spp. (2), Enterococcus faecalis (32), Klebsiella spp. (45), Enterobacter spp. (20), Escherichia coli (65), Salmonella spp. (6), Shigella spp. (2), Yersinia enterocolitica (1), Acinetobacter spp. (4), Proteus spp. (7), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (59), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4), Candida spp. (10) and Aspergillus spp. (7). In vitro selection of resistance to Akacid plus was carried out on 24 strains. Toxicological analyses were also performed. RESULTS: All tested agents were more effective against Staphylococcus spp. and Bacillus spp. than against E. faecalis and Gram-negative bacteria. The MIC90s of chlorhexidine and mupirocin showed a 4-fold and 32-fold increase for methicillin-resistant S. aureus in comparison with methicillin-susceptible strains, while MIC values of Akacid plus were similar for antibiotic-susceptible and multiresistant strains. Bactericidal action of Akacid plus was observed at 1-2x MIC. The in vitro selection of resistance test showed no increase in MIC values of Akacid plus for any isolate after 30 passages. In addition, Akacid plus showed low oral and dermal toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary results demonstrate the broad antimicrobial properties of Akacid plus, which makes it a promising tool for topical application in the prophylaxis and treatment of bacterial and fungal infections.
TI  - Fatality due to septicemia and hemorrhage in a patient with spinal cord injury and ischemic heart disease with the need for long-term catheter drainage.
AB  - Percutaneous suprapubic cystostomy is generally considered to be a safe procedure provided the bladder is distended adequately, as palpable bladder is the landmark for insertion of a trocar. This report describes fatality due to septicemia and hemorrhage following suprapubic catheter insertion in a tetraplegic male patient with long-term indwelling urethral catheter drainage and urine infection with Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas species, and Enterococcus faecalis. Before the surgical procedure was begun, the urinary bladder was distended by repeated injection of 50 mL of sterile, 0.9% sodium chloride through the urethral catheter with a catheter-tip syringe until the bladder became palpable in the suprapubic region; by this time, the bladder had been filled forcibly with 500 mL of saline. Percutaneous cystostomy was performed with the use of an Add-a-Cath trocar and cannula (Femcare Limited, Nottingham, Nottinghamshire, UK). Immediately after a 16 French Foley catheter had been inserted, the drainage fluid appeared heavily stained with blood. The patient developed septicemia, and a blood culture report, received posthumously, showed growth of E. coli. Despite resuscitative measures, the patient expired 13 hours after suprapubic catheter insertion. Postmortem examination revealed bilateral hydronephrosis with fluid and clotted blood in the renal pelves and ureters; the urinary bladder showed a thick wall and hemorrhagic mucosa. This fatal incident raises the question of whether forcible distention of the urinary bladder for percutaneous cystostomy is safe in patients with spinal cord injury who have a small-capacity bladder, infected urine, and ischemic heart disease. In such patients, it may be prudent to avoid forcible distention of the urinary bladder and instead perform ultrasound-guided or fluoroscopically guided suprapubic cystostomy.

TI  - DNA microarray for detection of macrolide resistance genes.
AB  - A DNA microarray was developed to detect bacterial genes conferring resistance to macrolides and related antibiotics. A database containing 65 nonredundant genes selected from publicly available DNA sequences was constructed and used to design 100 oligonucleotide probes that could specifically detect and discriminate all 65 genes. Probes were spotted on a glass slide, and the array was reacted with DNA templates extracted from 20 reference strains of eight different bacterial species (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Escherichia coli, and Bacteroides fragilis) known to harbor 29 different macrolide resistance genes. Hybridization results showed that probes reacted with, and only with, the expected DNA templates and allowed discovery of three unexpected genes, including msr(SA) in B. fragilis, an efflux gene that has not yet been described for gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Innovative wavelengths in endodontic treatment.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The sanitation of the root canal system and the adjacent dentin has always been a key requirement for successful endodontics. In recent years, various laser systems have provided a major contribution to this aim, namely the Nd:YAG-, the 810 nm Diode-, the Er:YAG-, and the Er,Cr:YSGG laser. Numerous studies could prove their efficiency within the endodontic procedure. Recently, two new wavelengths have been introduced to the field of oral laser applications: The KTP laser emitting at 532 nm and the 980 nm diode laser. The present in vitro investigation was performed to evaluate the effects of these laser systems focusing on their antibacterial effect in deep layers of dentin and their impact on the root canal dentin. STUDY DESIGN/MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two-hundred slices of root dentin with a thickness of 1 mm were obtained by longitudinal cuts of freshly extracted human premolars. The samples were steam sterilized and subsequently inoculated with a suspension of either Escherichia coli or Enterococcus faecalis. After the incubation, the samples were randomly assigned to the two different laser systems tested. Each laser group consisted of two different operational settings and a control. The dentinal samples underwent "indirect" laser irradiation through the dentin from the bacteria-free side and were then subjected to a classical quantitative microbiologic evaluation. To assess the temperature increase during the irradiation procedure, additional measurements were carried out using a thermocouple. To assess the impacts on the root canal walls, 20 additional samples underwent laser irradiation at two different settings and were subjected to scanning electron microscopy. RESULTS: Microbiology indicated that both laser systems were capable of significant reductions in both test strains. At an effective output power of 1 W, E. coli was reduced by at least 3 log steps in most of the samples by the tested wavelengths, with the best results for the KTP laser showing complete eradication of E. coli in 75% of the samples. E. faecalis, a stubborn invader of the root canal, showed minor changes in bacterial count at 1 W. Using the higher setting of 1.5 W, significant reductions of E. coli were again observed with both laser systems, where the lasers were capable of complete eradication of E. faecalis to a significant extent. There was no significant relation between the temperature increase and the bactericidal effect. CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrates that both wavelengths investigated could be suitable for the disinfection of even the deeper layers of dentin and equal the results achieved by established wavelengths in state-of-the-art endodontics.
TI  - [Antibiotic-resistance in Italy: activity of the first year of the surveillance project AR-ISS].
AB  - The antibiotic resistance surveillance project AR-ISS, started in 2001, is based  on a network of 62 sentinel microbiological laboratories throughout the country. The laboratories collect and transmit data to the Istituto Superiore di Sanita on the antibiotic susceptibility of bloodstream isolates of 7 species: Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis/faecium, Klebsiella pneumoniae/oxytoca ed Escherichia coli. They also send selected bacterial strains for further characterization. Results of the first year of surveillance are presented and are compared with data from the previous study EARSS-Italia and from other European countries. Oxacillin resistance in S. aureus appears to be stable, however, it remains one of the highest in Europe (41,5%). No strain with intermediate susceptibility or resistance to vancomycin has been isolated. In S. pneumoniae, the level of penicillin resistance is moderate (10,8%), but macrolide resistance has increased greatly (37,6% versus 28,6% of the previous study), following a tendency common to several European countries. Unexpectedly, vancomycin resistance in E. faecium was found to be 18%, the highest in Europe. Presumptive ESBL production in Gram-negative organisms can be estimated at 20% in Klebsiella and 1% in E. coli. Ampicillin and ciprofloxacin resistance in E. coli (respectively 50% and 18%) are among the highest in Europe. In conclusion, the rate of antibiotic resistance in the species studied is worrisome and requires continuing monitoring. Although some activities of AR-ISS need improvements, the surveillance has the potentiality to produce relevant and representative data about antibiotic resistance in Italy that can be used for comparison at the European level.
TI  - [Antimicrobial susceptibilities of organisms isolated from patients with urinary  tract infections in 2002].
AB  - Using the agar dilution method, the antibacterial activity of 18 antibiotics inclusive of 4 carbapenems were investigated against 101 strains of urinary pathogens isolated from patients with urinary tract infections who visited the Department of Urology at Kagoshima University Hospital, between January and December 2002. 4 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 3 strains of Staphylococcus spp. (exclusive of S. aureus), 14 strains of Enterococcus faecalis, 3 strains of Enterococcus spp. (exclusive of E. faecalis), 41 strains of Escherichia coli, 21 strains of Enterobacteriaceae (exclusive of E. coli), 12 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 3 strains of glucose-nonfermentative Gram-negative rods (exclusive of P. aeruginosa) were examined. 1. Against clinical isolates of Gram-positive bacteria, vancomycin and teicoplanin were active. Additionally, arbekacin was active against S. aureus clinical isolates and ampicillin was active against E. faecalis clinical isolates. Carbapenems were active against clinical isolates of Gram-positive bacteria, except for multi-drug resistant strains of Gram-positive bacteria, such as methicillin-resistant S. aureus. 2. As for clinical isolates of Gram-negative bacteria, meropenem was most active against Enterobacteriaceae among 13 antibiotics tested. Against P. aeruginosa clinical isolates, MIC90 of meropenem was the lowest among 13 antibiotics tested. In addition, resistant rate of meropenem and biapenem against P. aeruginosa clinical isolates was lower than those of the other carbapenems tested. 3. As main urinary pathogens showed no remarkable increase in resistance to carbapenems, it can be stated that carbapenems retain their position as the drug of first choice for severe infection.
TI  - Antibiofilm activity of GlmU enzyme inhibitors against catheter-associated uropathogens.
AB  - The colonization of uropathogenic bacteria on urinary catheters resulting in biofilm formation frequently leads to the infection of surrounding tissue and often requires removal of the catheter. Infections associated with biofilms are difficult to treat since they may be more than 1,000 times more resistant to antibiotics than their planktonic counterparts. We have developed an antibiofilm composition comprising an N-acetyl-D-glucosamine-1-phosphate acetyltransferase (GlmU) inhibitor and protamine sulfate, a cationic polypeptide. The antibiofilm activity of GlmU inhibitors, such as iodoacetamide (IDA), N-ethyl maleimide (NEM), and NEM analogs, including N-phenyl maleimide, N,N'-(1,2-phenylene)dimaleimide (oPDM), and N-(1-pyrenyl)maleimide (PyrM), was tested against that of catheter-associated uropathogens. Both IDA and NEM inhibited biofilm formation in Escherichia coli. All NEM analogs showed antibiofilm activity against clinical isolates of E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Enterococcus faecalis. The combination of oPDM with protamine sulfate (PS) enhanced its antibiofilm activity and reduced its effective concentration to as low as 12.5 microM. In addition, we found that the in vitro inhibitory activity of oPDM-plus-PS-coated silicone catheters against P. aeruginosa and S. epidermidis colonization was superior to that of catheters coated with silver hydrogel. Confocal scanning laser microscopy further confirmed that the oPDM-plus-PS-coated silicone catheters were almost free from bacterial colonization. Thus, a broad-spectrum antibiofilm composition comprising a GlmU inhibitor and protamine sulfate shows promise for use in anti-infective coatings for medical devices, including urinary catheters.

TI  - Antibacterial analysis in vitro of ethyl-cyanoacrylate against ocular pathogens.
AB  - PURPOSE: To analyze the antimicrobial properties of ethyl-cyanoacrylate (Superbonder, Loctite, Brazil) in vitro in different microorganisms related to corneal infections. METHODS: We analyzed the following microorganisms: (1) Staphylococcus aureus (multiresistant); (2) S. aureus (ATCC 25923); (3) coagulase-negative Staphylococcus; (4) Streptococcus pyogenes; (5) Streptococcus pneumoniae; (6) Pseudomonas aeruginosa (multiresistant); (7) P. aeruginosa (ATCC 27853); (8) Escherichia coli (ATCC25922); and (9) Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29212). One drop of the glue was dropped directly into the nutrient broth. The plates were incubated at 35 +/- 2 degrees C and its growth examined after 24 hours. Bactericidal activity of the glue was verified by sampling inhibition zones when present. The samples were plated in blood agar an analyzed after 24 and 48 hours. RESULTS: The ethyl-cyanoacrylate inhibited the growth of every gram-positive microorganism tested and showed bactericidal effect over 70% for all of them. Among the gram-negative microorganisms, only the E. coli and the E. faecalis had its growth inhibited, and the bactericidal effect was 60% and 40%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The ethyl-cyanoacrylate has bacteriostatic and bactericidal action in vitro, mainly against gram-positive microorganisms.
TI  - First genetic characterization of a bacterial beta-phenylethylamine biosynthetic  enzyme in Enterococcus faecium RM58.
AB  - Enterococcus faecium RM58 produces beta-phenylethylamine and tyramine. A gene from Ent. faecium RM58 coding for a 625 amino-acid residues protein that shows 85% identity to Enterococcus faecalis tyrosine decarboxylase has been expressed in Escherichia coli, resulting in L-phenylalanine and L-tyrosine decarboxylase activities. Both activities were lost when a truncated protein lacking 84 amino acids at its C-terminus was expressed in E. coli. This study constitutes the first genetic characterization of a bacterial protein having L-phenylalanine decarboxylase activity and solves a long-standing question regarding the specificity of tyrosine decarboxylases in enterococci.
TI  - [Bacterial pathogens and resistance patterns in community acquired pediatric urinary tract infection: experience of 152 cases].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the pathogen distribution and resistance patterns in childhood urinary tract infection in order to provide references for optimal use of antibiotics in the treatment of this disorder. METHODS: The clinical data of 152 children with community acquired urinary tract infection (urinary culture positive) between December 2001 and December 2004 were studied retrospectively. The bacterial pathogens of urinary tract infection and antimicrobial resistance were analyzed. RESULTS: Gram-negative bacilli was predominant pathogenic bacteria, accounting for 79.0% of the cases, and Escherichia coli (E. coli) was most commonly found (56.2%). Gram-positive cocci accounted for 18.4%, including 15.1% of Enterococcus faecalis. Fungi was rarely seen, accounting for only 2.6%. E. coli had a resistance rate of more than 50% to ampicillin, amoxicillin/clavulate, co-trimoxazole, cefradine, and fosomycin, but a very low resistance rate (< 4%) to 3rd generation cefalosporin, nitrofurantoi, azactom and amikacin. Enterococcus faecalis had a low resistance rate (< 20%) to ampicillin, vancomycin, penicillin, and nitrofurantoin. CONCLUSIONS: E. coli is the major pathogen in community acquired pediatric urinary tract infection, and Enterococcus has been become another important pathogen. Selection of antibiotics for the treatment of this disorder should base on drug-sensitive test results.
TI  - Determination of usnic acid in some Rhizoplaca species from Middle Anatolia and their antimicrobial activities.
AB  - Three species of lichens, Rhizoplaca chrysoleuca (Sm.) Zopf, Rhizoplaca melanopthalma (DC.) Leuckert & Poelt and Rhizoplaca peltata Ramonds Leuckert, were collected from middle Anatolia, Erciyes Mountain (Kayseri) in Turkey. Their usnic acid amounts were determined by HPLC in acetone extracts. In addition, antimicrobial activities of these extracts were determined against Escherichia coli (ATCC 35218), Enterococcus faecalis (RSKK 508), Proteus mirabilis (Pasteur Ens. 235), Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus megaterium and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. It was shown that, as the usnic acid amount increased, the antimicrobial activities increased too. The usnic acid contents of Rhizoplaca species varied between 0.19-4.0% dry weight.
TI  - Predominance of Gram-negative bacilli and increasing antimicrobial resistance in  nosocomial bloodstream infections at a university hospital in southern Taiwan, 1996-2003.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: While nosocomial infections cause substantial morbidity and mortality, the availability of timely and accurate epidemiological information on nosocomial pathogens is essential to the appropriate selection of empirical therapy. This study analyzed nosocomial bloodstream infections (NBSIs) surveillance data to determine trends in the distribution of pathogens and antimicrobial susceptibilities of these pathogens. METHODS: During the period from 1996 to 2003 at National Cheng Kung University Hospital, patients with NBSIs were enrolled in the study, and the ranking of pathogens and status of antimicrobial resistance were determined. RESULTS: From 1996 to 2003, there were 4,038 episodes of NBSIs. The overall incidence was 1.79 episodes per 1,000 inpatient-days. Aerobic Gram-negative bacilli, Gram-positive cocci, fungi, and anaerobes were responsible for 51%, 37%, 10%, and 1.6% of NBSIs, respectively. The 5 leading pathogens were coagulase-negative staphylococci (16% of NBSIs), Staphylococcus aureus (13%), Candida spp. (10%), Acinetobacter baumannii (8%), and Escherichia coli (8%). Oxacillin resistance was found in 90% of coagulase-negative staphylococci and 75% of S. aureus isolates. In contrast to Enterococcus faecalis, in which only 1% of isolates were resistant to ampicillin, 78% of Enterococcus faecium isolates were resistant to ampicillin. The emerging antimicrobial-resistant Gram-negative pathogens included multidrug-resistant A. baumannii, cephalosporin- or fluoroquinolone-resistant E. coli, and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing Klebsiella pneumoniae and E. coli. Despite the annual increase in the use of fluconazole, Candida albicans (54%) remained the most common causative pathogen of nosocomial candidemia. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, Gram-negative bacilli predominated among pathogens causing NBSIs and an upsurge in the threat of antimicrobial resistance in our hospital occurred during the 8-year period. Surveillance of the characteristics of NBSIs and antimicrobial resistance patterns, together with appropriate antibiotic and infection control measures, should be reinforced.
TI  - Chlorine residual efficiency in inactivating bacteria from secondary contamination in Isfahan, 2002.
AB  - To investigate the inactivation of potential pathogens, we evaluated survival rates for Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Aeromonas hydrophila and Salmonella typhi in samples taken from the Isfahan drinking water system. Chlorine residual, pH, temperature and total organic carbon levels were measured. The organism most sensitive to chlorine was A. hydrophila. It was inactived in < 100 minutes at chlorine levels of 0.11 mg/L to 0.90 mg/L. The other 3 organisms showed higher resistance. E. coli tolerated 0.30 mg/L chlorine for > 1000 minutes while Ent. faecalis and S. typhi survived at total chlorine concentration of 0.50 mg/L for 100 minutes. We concluded that total chlorine levels of less than 0.71 mg/L in water supply systems cannot provide the recommended safety levels.
TI  - Universal primers for detection of common bacterial pathogens causing prosthetic  joint infection.
AB  - The diagnosis of low grade prosthetic joint infection is difficult and time consuming. Nested-PCR for universal bacterial DNA segments detection of "orthopaedic" bacteria was tested in a laboratory setting. This method is based on amplification of the 16S bacterial ribosomal RNA coding sequences. 11 species of the most frequent bacterial pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens) involved in prosthetic joint infections were studied. All could be detected rapidly and sensitively by this method.
TI  - Bacteriological urinalysis in patients after renal transplantation.
AB  - The study consisted of microbiological urinalysis performed in 269 patients after renal transplantation who remained under medical care at the Outpatient Service of the Transplantation Institute in Warsaw. The patients enrolled into the study had undergone renal transplantation 6 to 72 months before urine samples were collected. 304 urinalysis were performed. In the group of 269 patients, 42 individuals had bacteria in their urine what was confirmed in 47 urine cultures. Cases of bacteriuria were divided into 5 groups: 5 cases of symptomatic urinary tract infection (5 individuals--2% of all studied patients), 27 cases of asymptomatic bacteriuria in 22 individuals (8% of all studied patients), 5 cases of insignificant bacteriuria in 5 patients (2%), 10 cases of involuntary urine contamination in 10 cases (4%). Eventually, urinary tract infection (UTI) was established in 27 patients (5 cases of symptomatic UTI and 22 cases of asymptomatic UTI) what makes out for 10% of all studied patients. In cases where urinalysis showed significant bacteriuria, following pathogens were detected in urine cultures: Escherichia coli: 22 strains, Enterococcus faecalis--4 strains, Enterobacter cloacae--2 strains and 1 strains of Ralstonia picketii, Streptococcus uberis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis. Over 90% of Gram-negative bacteria were susceptible to ceftriaxone and ceftazidime, as well as to amikacin and aztreonam which are the drugs usually administered intravenously in hospitalized patients. The only drug of similar efficacy, which could be administered orally in outpatients was fosfomycin.
TI  - Frequency and susceptibility profile of pathogens causing urinary tract infections at a tertiary care hospital in western Nepal.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Urinary tract infection (UTI) is the most common nosocomial infection among hospitalised patients. Area-specific monitoring studies aimed to gain knowledge about the type of pathogens responsible for UTIs and their resistance patterns may help the clinician to choose the correct empirical treatment. Recent reports have shown increasing resistance to commonly-used antibiotics. We aimed to study the antibiotic resistance pattern of the urinary pathogens isolated from hospitalised patients. METHODS: Three urine samples were collected by the mid-stream "clean catch" method from 1,680 clinically-suspected cases of urinary tract infections from inpatients of various clinical departments during one year. The samples were tested microbiologically by standard procedures. Antibiotic susceptibility of the isolated pathogens was tested for commonly-used antibiotics by Kirby-Bauer technique according to NCCLS guidelines. RESULTS: Significant bacteriuria was present in 71.7 percent of the samples, 17 percent were sterile, 4.8 percent showed insignificant bacteriuria, and 6.5 percent non-pathogenic bacteriuria. The most common pathogens isolated were Escherichia coli (59.4 percent), Klebsiella spp (15.7 percent) and Enterococcus faecalis (8.1 percent). The mean susceptibility was high for amikacin (87.2 percent), ciprofloxacin (74.8 percent), ceftazidime (71.5 percent) and gentamicin (70.4 percent) but low for nitrofurantoin (35 percent), cephalexin (49.7 percent) and ampicillin (50.5 percent). Escherichia coli was found to be most susceptible to amikacin (98 percent) followed by gentamicin (87.9 percent), ceftazidime (80.8 percent), norfloxacin (78.4 percent) and cotrimoxazole (77.9 percent). CONCLUSION: A high isolation rate of pathogens from urine samples of clinically-suspected UTI shows a good correlation between clinical findings and microbiological methods. The antibiotics commonly used in UTIs are less effective. Since the present study was a cross-sectional study, regular monitoring is required to establish reliable information about resistance pattern of urinary pathogens for optimal empirical therapy of patients with nosocomial UTIs.
TI  - Urinary tract infection and hyperbilirubinemia.
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence of urinary tract infection (UTI) in newborns with asymptomatic, unexplained indirect hyperbilirubinemia in the first two weeks of life. Jaundiced infants, otherwise clinically well, less than two weeks of ages, with a total bilirubin level above 15 mg/dl were eligible for the study. A bilirubin work-up including glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6 PD) level, as well as urinalysis and a urine culture were performed in all patients. Patients with UTI, defined as more than 10,000 colony-forming units per milliliter of a single pathogen obtained by bladder catheterization, were evaluated for sepsis. Renal function tests and renal ultrasound were performed in cases with UTI. During follow-up, voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) and dimercaptosuccinic acid scintigraphy (DMSA) were performed as well. A total of 102 patients were enrolled. The bilirubin work-up of patients did not demonstrate any significant underlying disorder. None of the infants had a high direct bilirubin level. UTI was diagnosed in eight (8%) cases [Enterobacter aerogenes (3/8:38%), Enterococcus faecalis (2/8:25%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (2/8:25%) and Escherichia coli (1/8:12%)]. Of those eight patients, only four (50%) had pyuria. Bacteriuria was present in seven (88%) patients. The sepsis screen was negative in all but one case with a high C-reactive protein (CRP) level. None of the patients had a positive blood culture. Renal function tests were within normal levels in all patients. Renal ultrasound showed urinary tract abnormalities in three (38%) patients (hydronephrosis, n=1 and pelviectasis, n=2). VCUG was performed in all patients during the study period and one had unilateral grade 3-4 reflux, while only one patient had a diverticulum of the bladder. DMSA was performed in seven patients and none had renal scars. It is of importance that UTI can occur in asymptomatic, jaundiced infants even in the first week of life. Although it is well known that UTI is a common cause of prolonged jaundice, urine culture should be considered in the bilirubin work-up of infants older than three days of age with an unknown etiology.
TI  - Value of automatized blood culture systems in the diagnosis of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis peritonitis.
AB  - Peritonitis is a common clinical problem that occurs in patients with end-stage renal disease treated by peritoneal dialysis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the value of blood culture systems for the diagnosis of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) peritonitis among 26 samples of peritoneal fluid obtained from patients with the suspicion of CAPD peritonitis. Significant growth was detected in 12 (70.5%) of 17 bacteria-positive samples. The most striking finding was that 8 (66.6%) of these 12 results were obtained only from blood culture bottles. The identified pathogens were methicillin-sensitive coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 5), alpha-hemolytic streptococci (n = 2), Corynebacterium spp. (n = 2), Escherichia coli (n = 2), and Enterococcus faecalis (n = 1). Using blood culture bottles inoculated with peritoneal fluid at the bedside, rather than submitting the specimen to the laboratory for later processing, is advocated in the prompt diagnosis of CAPD peritonitis.
TI  - Genotypic and phenotypic heterogeneity in Enterococcus isolates from Batzos, a raw goat milk cheese.
AB  - This study investigated the genotypic and phenotypic diversity in 34 isolates of  enterococci obtained during ripening of Batzos cheese from raw goat milk and characterized phenotypically as Enterococcus durans. RAPD-PCR, plasmid profiling and PFGE were used to study the genetic variability and distinguish closely related isolates. Species recognition by means of RAPD-PCR was in agreement with the phenotypic identification for 29 strains. One strain was characterized as Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis by RAPD-PCR and four strains were grouped with the Enterococcus faecium reference strain. All strains were vancomycin sensitive, while 10 strains showed beta-haemolytic reaction on human blood and the majority of them (88.9%) showed decarboxylase activity on tyramine. All strains exhibited antagonistic activity against Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Listeria monocytogenes and the majority inhibited Enterococcus faecalis. Isolates displayed weak acidifying ability and low proteolytic activities when grown in milk for 24h. However, their caseinolytic activity after growth in milk for seven days was significant with preference for alphas-casein degradation.
TI  - Thermal inactivation of water-borne pathogenic and indicator bacteria at sub-boiling temperatures.
AB  - The use of harvested rainwater in domestic hot water systems can result in optimised environmental and economic benefits to urban water cycle management, however, the water quality and health risks of such a scenario have not been adequately investigated. Thermal inactivation analyses were carried out on eight species of non-spore-forming bacteria in a water medium at temperatures relevant to domestic hot water systems (55-65 degrees C), and susceptibilities to heat stress were compared using D-values. The D-value was defined as the time required to reduce a bacterial population by 90% or 1 log reduction. The results found that both tested strains of Enterococcus faecalis were the most heat resistant of the bacteria studied, followed by the pathogens Shigella sonnei biotype A and Escherichia coli O157:H7, and the non-pathogenic E. coli O3:H6. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was found to be less resistant to heat, while Salmonella typhimurium, Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Aeromonas hydrophila displayed minimal heat resistance capacities. At 65 degrees C, little thermal resistance was demonstrated by any species, with log reductions in concentration occurring within seconds. The results of this study suggested that the temperature range from 55 to 65 degrees C was critical for effective elimination of enteric/pathogenic bacterial components and supported the thesis that hot water systems should operate at a minimum of 60 degrees C.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (2003). III. Secular changes in susceptibility].
AB  - The bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) isolated from 565 patients diagnosed as urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 14 institutions in Japan were collected between August 2003 and July 2004. The susceptibilities of these bacteria to various antimicrobial agents were examined. The bacteria were divided into 2 groups consisting of uncomplicated UTIs and complicated UTIs (with and without indwelling catheter) based on their isolation origins. The results were compared with those obtained between 1994 and 2002. The drug sensitivity of S. aureus in this year was similar to those in up to the previous years and S. aureus showed the best susceptibility to vancomycin. The drug sensitivity of E. faecalis in this year also was similar to those in up to the previous years. The drug sensitivity of E. coli in this year was generally good except penicillins and was similar to those in up to the previous years. Among cephems, cefozopran (CZOP) and cefpirome (CPR) showed the highest potency activity (MIC90: < or = 0.125 microg/mL). An antibacterial activity of cefotiam (CTM) was stable for 10 years and was fine (MIC0: < or = 0.5 microg/mL). The sensitivity of E. coli to carbapenems and carumonam (CRMN) also was good like to CZOP. The sensitivity of the complicated UTIs group to quinolones, however, has decreased after 2000 and it was suggested that the resistance to the drug has developed. Kiebsiella spp. showed a decrease in the susceptibility to some of cephems. The drugs indicating a big decrease in the sensitivity were cefazolin, CTM, cefaclor, and cefpodoxime. Imipenem, carbapenems, also indicated a decrease in the sensitivity. The susceptibility of the strain to the other drugs was similar to that in up to the previous years. Among them, CZOP maintained good susceptibility (MIC90: > or = 0.125 microg/mL against uncomplicated UTIs, 0.25 microg/mL against complicated UTIs) like meropenem. The drug sensitivity of P. aeruginosa was generally low and was not much different from that in up to the previous years.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (2003). II. Background of patients].
AB  - Seven hundred and nineteen bacterial strains isolated from 565 patients diagnosed as having urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 14 institutions in Japan were collected between August 2002 and July 2003. The frequency of bacteria isolation divided with patient clinical background was compared. The clinical background investigated included sex, age, type of infections, timing of antibiotics administration, and presence or absence of surgery affecting a decrease in defense against infection. The bacterial strains were divided with the age and sex of the patients and the types of infections. In males, the number of patients aged less than 50 years was few and the complicated UTIs without indwelling catheter was observed most frequently. Number of patients aged 20-39 years was greater in female than male. In all of ages except 0-9 and 70-79 years, the ratio of the uncomplicated UTIs was high, accounting for 44.4-91.7% of all types of infections. In the present time, the bacteria most frequently isolated were Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus faecalis also were relatively frequently isolated. E. coli was most frequently isolated from the uncomplicated UTIs, and P. aeruginosa and E. faecalis were frequently isolated from the complicated UTIs with indwelling catheter. With respect to the relation of these results to the age of the patients, in the uncomplicated UTIs, the isolation frequency of E. coli was the highest in all age groups, accounting for 40% or higher. In the complicated UTIs without indwelling catheter, the isolation frequency of E. coli decreased with aging of the patients but still was the highest in all age groups. In the complicated UTIs with indwelling catheter, the isolation frequency of E. coli was lower than in the uncomplicated UTIs in all age groups and P. aeruginosa and E. faecalis were more frequently isolated. In comparison of causative bacteria in UTIs between before and after the administration of antibiotics, P. aeruginosa increased after the administration in any types of UTIs. In comparison of causative bacteria in UTIs with or without surgery, E. coli was more frequently isolated in the patients without surgery, while P. aeruginosa and E. faecalis were more frequently isolated in the patients with surgery in any UTIs.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (2003). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The bacterial strains isolated from 565 patients diagnosed as having urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 14 institutions in Japan were collected between August 2003 and July 2004. The susceptibilities of them to many kinds of antimicrobial agents were investigated. Of them, 701 strains were estimated as prophlogistic bacteria and used for the investigation. The strains consisted of 258 Gram-positive bacterial strains (36.8%) and 443 Gram-negative bacterial strains (63.2%). Against Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin (VCM) showed the strongest activity and prevented the growth of all strains with 2 microg/mL. Against Streptococcus agalactiae, ampicillin (ABPC), cefozopran (CZOP), imipenem (IPM), and clarithromycin (CAM) showed a strong activity and the MIC90 was 0.125 microg/mL or less. Against Enterococcus faecalis, VCM, ABPC, and IPM showed a strong antibacterial activity. The antibacterial activity of cephems to Escherichia coli was generally good, and especially CZOP and cefpirome (CPR) showed the strongest activity (MIC90: < or = 0.125 microg/mL). Quinolone resistant E. coli [MIC of ciprofloxacin (CPFX): > or =4 microg/mL] was detected at frequency of 15.7%, which was higher than that in the last year. Against Klebsiella pneumoniae, meropenem (MEPM) showed the strongest activity and next, the antibacterial activity of CRMN and CZOP was good. The antibacterial activity of the other cephems, however, significantly decreased, compared with that evaluated in last year. Against Serratia marcescens, MEPM had the strongest antibacterial activity. Against Proteus mirabilis, MEPM and CRMN showed the strongest activity and prevented the growth of all strains with 0.125 microg/mL or less. Nest, cefmenoxime (CMX), ceftazidime (CAZ), cefixime (CFIX), cefpodoxime (CPDX), CPR, CZOP, and cefditoren (CDTR) showed a strong activity. The antibacterial activity of the drugs to Pseudomonas aeruginosa was generally low, and MIC90 of all the drugs was ranged from 32 to < or = 256 microg/mL except IPM and amikacin (AMK) having 16 microg/mL. The antibacterial activity of CZOP was relatively good (MIC50: 2 microg/mL).
TI  - The TraA relaxase autoregulates the putative type IV secretion-like system encoded by the broad-host-range Streptococcus agalactiae plasmid pIP501.
AB  - The conjugative multiple antibiotic resistance plasmid pIP501 can be transferred  and stably maintained in a variety of Gram-positive genera, including multicellular Streptomyces lividans, as well as in Gram-negative Escherichia coli. The 15 putative pIP501 transfer (tra) genes are organized in an operon-like structure terminating in a strong transcriptional terminator. This paper reports co-transcription of the pIP501 tra genes in exponentially growing Enterococcus faecalis JH2-2 cells, as shown by RT-PCR. The tra genes are expressed throughout the life cycle of Ent. faecalis, and the expression level is independent of the growth phase. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays indicated that the TraA relaxase, the first gene of the tra operon, binds to the tra promoter P(tra), which partially overlaps with the origin of transfer (oriT). DNase I footprinting experiments further delimited the TraA binding region and defined the nucleotides bound by TraA. Beta-Galactosidase assays with P(tra)-lacZ fusions proved P(tra) promoter activity, which was strongly repressed when TraA was supplied in trans. Thus, it is concluded that the pIP501 tra operon is negatively autoregulated at the transcriptional level by the conjugative DNA relaxase TraA.
TI  - Comparison of workflow and accuracy of identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococci by Vitek 2 and routine methods.
AB  - Three hundred and fifty-three consecutive urine cultures growing Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa or enterococci were subjected to parallel identification (ID) and antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) by Vitek 2 and routine methods, including simple screening tests or API 20 E for ID and standardized disc diffusion for AST. Accuracy of results, technician hands-on time required by both methods and time to results were compared. Vitek 2 correctly identified 322 (94.7%) of the 340 gram-negative isolates and 17 (81%) of the 21 Enterococcus faecalis strains. AST by Vitek 2 and disc diffusion gave category agreement for 4,058 (95.5%) of 4,248 organism-antimicrobial agent combinations. With MIC determination by E-test as reference, AST by Vitek 2 and disc diffusion produced 15 and 3 very major errors, respectively. Six (40%) of the fifteen very major errors by Vitek 2 were associated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. With an average of 22 specimens processed per day, use of Vitek 2 saved 80 min per day of technician hands-on time as compared to routine methods. Regarding the cost of hands-on worktime and consumables, use of Vitek 2 for identification of Escherichia coli-screened Enterobacteriaceae saved 0.70 p per sample in comparison to API 20 E. More than 80% of Enterobacteriaceae introduced to Vitek 2 in the morning could be reported by 16:00.
TI  - Comparison of bactericidal activity of six lysozymes at atmospheric pressure and  under high hydrostatic pressure.
AB  - The antibacterial working range of six lysozymes was tested under ambient and high pressure, on a panel of five gram-positive (Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis, Listeria innocua, Staphylococcus aureus and Micrococcus lysodeikticus) and five gram-negative bacteria (Yersinia enterocolitica, Shigella flexneri, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella typhimurium). The lysozymes included two that are commercially available (hen egg white lysozyme or HEWL, and mutanolysin from Streptomyces globisporus or M1L), and four that were chromatographically purified (bacteriophage lambda lysozyme or LaL, bacteriophage T4 lysozyme or T4L, goose egg white lysozyme or GEWL, and cauliflower lysozyme or CFL). T4L, LaL and GEWL were highly pure as evaluated by silver staining of SDS-PAGE gels and zymogram analysis while CFL was only partially pure. At ambient pressure each gram-positive test organism displayed a specific pattern of sensitivity to the six lysozymes, but none of the gram-negative bacteria was sensitive to any of the lysozymes. High pressure treatment (130-300 MPa, 25 degrees C, 15 min) sensitised several gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria for one or more lysozymes. M. lysodeikticus and P. aeruginosa became sensitive to all lysozymes under high pressure, S. typhimurium remained completely insensitive to all lysozymes, and the other bacteria showed sensitisation to some of the lysozymes. The possible applications of the different lysozymes as biopreservatives, and the possible reasons for the observed differences in bactericidal specificity are discussed.
TI  - Study of the efficacy of Coated VICRYL Plus Antibacterial suture (coated Polyglactin 910 suture with Triclosan) in two animal models of general surgery.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy in vitro and in vivo of a new antibacterial  suture (PGAB) compared with a traditional braided suture (PG). Our primary goals were to study microbiological effectiveness and impact on wound healing of PGAB vs PG. Secondary goal was to analyze influence on inflammatory response. METHODS: In vitro study: clinical samples of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, S. hominis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Staphylococcus auricularis, Enterococcus faecalis, Corynebacterium spp. and Escherichia coli were studied. We also implanted a flat mesh in 10 minipigs, four incisions each (two PG and two PGAB) two contaminated with S. epidermidis and two not contaminated. Finally, we performed four colic anastomosis in each of 10 minipigs, two contaminated with E. coli and two not contaminated (two PG and two PGAB). We studied the inflammatory and wound healing processes in both models. RESULTS: We observed a bactericidal efficacy of PGAB against grampositive, and bacteriostatic effect against E. coli. Mesh study: recovered CFU were lower in the group PGAB vs PG. In the group PGAB, inflammatory mediators' concentrations were lower. In the group PGAB, concentrations of wound healing mediators were normal. Colic anastomosis: recovered CFU were lower in the group PGAB vs the group PG. In the group PGAB we observed a reduction of inflammatory mediators. In the group PGAB we observed normalized concentrations of wound healing mediators. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates microbiological efficacy of PGAB, that normalizes wound healing process, and an anti-inflammatory effect.
TI  - Occurrence and growth characteristics of Escherichia coli and enterococci within  the accumulated fluid of the northern pitcher plant (Sarracenia purpurea L.).
AB  - Sarracenia purpurea L., a carnivorous bog plant (also known as the pitcher plant), represents an excellent model of a well-defined, self-contained ecosystem; the individual pitchers of the plant serve as a microhabitat for a variety of micro- and macro-organisms. Previously, fecal indicator bacteria (Escherichia coli and enterococci) were shown as incidental contaminants in pitcher fluid; however, whether their occurrence in pitcher fluid is incidental or common has not been established. The purpose of this study was to investigate the occurrence, distribution, and growth potential of E. coli and enterococci in pitcher plant fluid from a protected bog in northwest Indiana. Escherichia coli and enterococci were recovered in pitcher fluids (n=43 plants), with mean densities (log CFU mL-1) of 1.28+/-0.23 and 1.97+/-0.27, respectively. In vitro experiments showed that E. coli growth in fluid not containing insects or indigenous organisms was directly proportional to the fluid concentration (growth was 10-fold in 24 h in 100% fluid); however, in the presence of other indigenous organisms, E. coli and enterococci were only sustained for 5 days at 26 degrees C. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis showed that the plant Enterococcus faecalis isolates were genetically distinct from the human isolates; identical PFGE patterns were observed among plant isolates that fell into one of six clonal groups. These findings suggest that (i) E. coli and enterococci occurrence in pitcher plants is rather common in the bog studied, although their originating source is unclear, and (ii) the pitcher fluid contains adequate nutrients, especially carbon and energy sources, to promote the growth of indicator bacteria; however, under natural conditions, the biotic factors (e.g., competition for nutrients) may restrict their growth.
TI  - Detection and identification of intestinal pathogenic bacteria by hybridization to oligonucleotide microarrays.
AB  - AIM: To detect the common intestinal pathogenic bacteria quickly and accurately.  METHODS: A rapid (<3 h) experimental procedure was set up based upon the gene chip technology. Target genes were amplified and hybridized by oligonucleotide microarrays. RESULTS: One hundred and seventy strains of bacteria in pure culture belonging to 11 genera were successfully discriminated under comparatively same conditions, and a series of specific hybridization maps corresponding to each kind of bacteria were obtained. When this method was applied to 26 divided cultures, 25 (96.2%) were identified. CONCLUSION: Salmonella sp., Escherichia coli, Shigella sp., Listeria monocytogenes, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus sp., Bacillus cereus, Vibrio cholerae, Enterococcus faecalis, Yersinia enterocolitica, and Campylobacter jejuni can be detected and identified by our microarrays. The accuracy, range, and discrimination power of this assay can be continually improved by adding further oligonucleotides to the arrays without any significant increase of complexity or cost.
TI  - 3,5-dioxopyrazolidines, novel inhibitors of UDP-N- acetylenolpyruvylglucosamine reductase (MurB) with activity against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - A series of 3,5-dioxopyrazolidines was identified as novel inhibitors of UDP-N-acetylenolpyruvylglucosamine reductase (MurB). Compounds 1 to 3, which are 1,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)-3,5-dioxopyrazolidine-4-carboxamides, inhibited Escherichia coli MurB, Staphyloccocus aureus MurB, and E. coli MurA with 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50s) in the range of 4.1 to 6.8 microM, 4.3 to 10.3 microM, and 6.8 to 29.4 microM, respectively. Compound 4, a C-4-unsubstituted 1,2-bis(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-3,5-dioxopyrazolidine, showed moderate inhibitory activity against E. coli MurB, S. aureus MurB, and E. coli MurC (IC50s, 24.5 to 35 microM). A fluorescence-binding assay indicated tight binding of compound 3 with E. coli MurB, giving a dissociation constant of 260 nM. Structural characterization of E. coli MurB was undertaken, and the crystal structure of a complex with compound 4 was obtained at 2.4 A resolution. The crystal structure indicated the binding of a compound at the active site of MurB and specific interactions with active-site residues and the bound flavin adenine dinucleotide cofactor. Peptidoglycan biosynthesis studies using a strain of Staphylococcus epidermidis revealed reduced peptidoglycan biosynthesis upon incubation with 3,5-dioxopyrazolidines, with IC50s of 0.39 to 11.1 microM. Antibacterial activity was observed for compounds 1 to 3 (MICs, 0.25 to 16 microg/ml) and 4 (MICs, 4 to 8 microg/ml) against gram-positive bacteria including methicillin-resistant S. aureus, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae.
TI  - Erythromycin synergism with essential and trace elements.
AB  - In order to establish the role of various essential and trace element complexation on the antibacterial activity of various macrolide antibiotics, the synergistic or antagonistic behavior of erythromycin metal complexes have been studied and compared with the parent drug. Metal complexes of erythromycin with magnesium, calcium, chromium, manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel, copper, zinc and cadmium have been investigated for their antibacterial activity and compared with erythromycin by observing the changes in minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and by measuring the zone of inhibition of complexes against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive microorganisms. Various microorganisms used were Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, Proteus vulgaris, Shigella dysentery, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Staphylococcus epidermidis. For MIC observation, serial dilution method was employed and zone sizes were determined by diffusion disk method. Our investigations reveal that formation of erythromycin complexes result in synergistic effect i.e., antimicrobial activity of complexes of erythromycin increases with respect to parent erythromycin drug and MIC of drug metal complexes decreased.
TI  - Comparison of the effect of delayed entry into 2 different blood culture systems  (BACTEC 9240 and BacT/ALERT 3D) on culture positivity.
AB  - The effect of delayed entry (2-48 h) into BacTAlert 3D and BACTEC 9240 and the effect of 2 storage temperatures (22 degrees C vs 35 degrees C) on bacterial growth was evaluated. The delay in transportation of blood culture bottles stored at room temperature had no effect on the recovery rate for the first 12 h. Culture positivity was between 74.4% and 100% for different microorganisms at less than 24 h preincubation time. The positivity rate decreased significantly for Acinetobacter baumannii, Bacteroides fragilis, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae for more than 24 h of delay. Culture positivity was higher at 22 degrees C for all microorganisms especially for Enterococcus faecalis and P. aeruginosa. Effects of instrument, preincubation time, and temperature showed that the risk of culture negativity increased 1.5 times for BACTEC compared with BacTAlert 3D and increased 2.5 times for 35 degrees C compared with 22 degrees C. The negativity increased 5.5 times and 8.5 times at 24 and 48 h of delay respectively, compared with no delay.
TI  - Rigid sigmoidoscopy: a potential hazard for cross-contamination.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rigid sigmoidoscopy using a disposable or nondisposable sigmoidoscope is a common outpatient procedure. It has been assumed that the nondisposable bellows and light head of the sigmoidoscope remain free from enteric organisms so that the procedure is sterile if a disposable or nondisposable (metal) sigmoidoscope shaft is used. The aim of this study was to identify the presence of organisms within the bellows or light head of the sigmoidoscope. METHODS: Of 21 patients undergoing rigid sigmoidoscopy with a disposable instrument, bacterial cultures were taken from the inside of sterile Jackson-Pratt bulbs in 12 patients, with the bulbs being used to simulate the nondisposable insufflation bellows. In an additional nine patients, swabs were taken for culture from the inside of the nondisposable light head. RESULTS: Enteric gram-negative Escherichia coli and mixed anaerobic organisms were cultured from the Jackson-Pratt bulbs in two cases, and gram-positive organisms were cultured in another case. Gram-negative organisms, including Bacillus, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella, and Enterococcus faecalis, were cultured from the inside of the light head in two cases. CONCLUSION: Sigmoidoscopy using a disposable instrument is not a sterile procedure and may pose a risk of patient-to-patient cross-contamination by potentially harboring organisms in the bellows or light head.
TI  - Roxithromycin antagonism with essential and trace elements.
AB  - In order to ascertain the role of various essential and trace element complexation on the antibacterial activity of various macrolide antibiotics, the synergistic or antagonistic behavior of roxithromycin metal complexes have been studied and compared with the parent drug. Metal complexes of roxithromycin with magnesium, calcium, chromium, manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel, copper, zinc and cadmium have been investigated for their antibacterial activity and compared with roxithromycin by observing the changes in minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and by measuring the zone of inhibition of complexes against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive microorganisms. Various microorganisms used were Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, Proteus vulgaris, Shigella dysentery, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Staphylococcus epidermidis. For MIC observation, serial dilution method was employed and zone sizes were determined by diffusion disk method. Our investigations divulge that formation of roxithromycin complexes results in antagonistic behavior against few microorganisms where in MIC is increased with respect to the parent drug, while against most of the microorganism, there was no effect on the MIC of the roxithromycin metal complexes with respect to parent roxithromycin.
TI  - Inductive effects of environmental concentration of atrazine on Escherichia coli  and Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - Atrazine solutions (0.1, 1, 10 and 100 microg/L) inoculated with Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis under natural conditions significantly increased (p < or = 0.05) the population levels of both test bacteria; it indicates the ability of bacterial cells to degrade atrazine and to use the original compound or its degradation products as nutrient(s). In some cases, alterations in the morphology of the colonies were also observed on selective solid media. Biochemical differentiation was also found and, on the other hand, a loss of culturability was recorded; this suggests that bacteria have entered in a viable but nonculturable state. A re-appearance of the colonies occurred after inoculation on tryptone-soy agar with atrazine.
TI  - Partial characterization of enterocin MR99 from a corn silage isolate of Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - AIMS: To assess the inhibitory activity on Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria of several species of enterococci recovered from a natural corn silage. METHODS AND RESULTS: The inhibitory activity of strains of Enterococcus faecalis (58), Enterococcus faecium (35), Enterococcus gallinarum (3) and Enterococcus casseliflavus (4) were studied employing indicator strains from various sources (clinical, food and ATCC). Enterococcus faecalis MR99, the only strain with inhibitory activity, inhibited other enterococci, Listeria spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium spp., Bacillus spp., Escherichia coli, Shigella sonnei and Shigella flexneri. The bacterium contained only one conjugative pheromone-responsive plasmid. The partially chromatography-purified MR99 enterocin (PPE) had a molecular weight of approx. 5000 Da and a pI of 6.2, was sensitive to proteolytic enzymes and could be extracted in benzene and butanol. It appeared stable to adjustment of pH 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0 and 8.0 and was resistant to heat. Inactivation was at 15 min at 121 degrees C. Enterocin MR99 was bactericidal on strains of Listeria monocytogenes, Staph. aureus, and bovine mastitis agents, it was bacteriostatic on E. coli. Although enterocins MR99 and AS48 have inhibitory activity on Gram-negative bacilli, PCR studies demonstrated a lack of relationship between them. CONCLUSIONS: The active component had a protein nature, was resistant to heat and presented a wide inhibitory spectrum. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The biological properties of Ent. faecalis MR99 suggest that this strain merits further investigations so it can be applied in human and veterinary health programmes.
TI  - Backbone 1H, 15N, and 13C resonance assignments and secondary-structure of conserved hypothetical protein HP0894 from Helicobacter pylori.
AB  - HP0894 (SwissProt/TrEMBL ID O25554) is an 88-residue conserved hypothetical protein from Helicobacter pylori strain 26695 with a calculated pI of 8.5 and a molecular weight of 10.38 kDa. Proteins with sequence similarity to HP0894 exist in Vibrio choierae, Enterococcus faecalis, Campylobacter jejuni, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli O157, etc. Here we report the sequence-specific backbone resonance assignments of HP0894. About 97.5% (418/429) of the HN, N, CO, Ca, Cbeta resonances of the 88 residues of HP0894 were assigned. On the basis of these assignments, three helical regions and four strand regions were identified using the CSI program. This study is a prerequisite for calculating the solution structure of HP0894, and studying its interaction with its substrates, if any, and/or with other proteins.
TI  - Bloodstream infections in organ transplant recipients receiving alemtuzumab: no evidence of occurrence of organisms typically associated with profound T cell depletion.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Alemtuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against CD52, a cell surface antigen expressed on B and T lymphocytes, monocytes and NK cells. Its use results in a profound decrease in CD4 positive T lymphocytes. Alemtuzumab is used as induction immunosuppression and therapy for rejection in organ transplant recipients in some centers. We followed a cohort of 449 consecutive transplant recipients who received alemtuzumab to determine the occurrence of bloodstream infections, particularly those previously associated with decrease in CD4 positive T lymphocytes. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifteen percent (69/449) patients had at least one episode of bloodstream infection. However, no patient had bacteremia with Streptococcus pneumoniae, Listeria monocytogenes, non-typhoidal Salmonella or Mycobacterium avium complex. Fungaemia was rare, occurring in 1.5% of patients. The most common organisms isolated from the blood were Staphylococcus aureus (21 episodes), coagulase negative Staphylococcus (14 episodes), Klebsiella pneumoniae (12 episodes), Enterococcus faecium (11 episodes), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10 episodes), Enterococcus faecalis (9 episodes) and Escherichia coli (7 episodes). DISCUSSION: We conclude that although alemtuzumab use is associated with profound CD4 positive T lymphocyte depletion, alemtuzumab does not seem to be associated with an increased risk of bloodstream infection with pathogens typically seen in other disorders of CD4 cell depletion, such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.
TI  - Construction of improved temperature-sensitive and mobilizable vectors and their  use for constructing mutations in the adhesin-encoding acm gene of poorly transformable clinical Enterococcus faecium strains.
AB  - Inactivation by allelic exchange in clinical isolates of the emerging nosocomial  pathogen Enterococcus faecium has been hindered by lack of efficient tools, and, in this study, transformation of clinical isolates was found to be particularly problematic. For this reason, a vector for allelic replacement (pTEX5500ts) was constructed that includes (i) the pWV01-based gram-positive repAts replication region, which is known to confer a high degree of temperature intolerance, (ii) Escherichia coli oriR from pUC18, (iii) two extended multiple-cloning sites located upstream and downstream of one of the marker genes for efficient cloning of flanking regions for double-crossover mutagenesis, (iv) transcriptional terminator sites to terminate undesired readthrough, and (v) a synthetic extended promoter region containing the cat gene for allelic exchange and a high-level gentamicin resistance gene, aph(2'')-Id, to distinguish double-crossover recombination, both of which are functional in gram-positive and gram-negative backgrounds. To demonstrate the functionality of this vector, the vector was used to construct an acm (encoding an adhesin to collagen from E. faecium) deletion mutant of a poorly transformable multidrug-resistant E. faecium endocarditis isolate, TX0082. The acm-deleted strain, TX6051 (TX0082Deltaacm), was shown to lack Acm on its surface, which resulted in the abolishment of the collagen adherence phenotype observed in TX0082. A mobilizable derivative (pTEX5501ts) that contains oriT of Tn916 to facilitate conjugative transfer from the transformable E. faecalis strain JH2Sm::Tn916 to E. faecium was also constructed. Using this vector, the acm gene of a nonelectroporable E. faecium wound isolate was successfully interrupted. Thus, pTEX5500ts and its mobilizable derivative demonstrated their roles as important tools by helping to create the first reported allelic replacement in E. faecium; the constructed this acm deletion mutant will be useful for assessing the role of acm in E. faecium pathogenesis using animal models.
TI  - Antimicrobial activities of silver dressings: an in vitro comparison.
AB  - A range of silver-coated or -impregnated dressings are now commercially available for use but comparative data on their antimicrobial efficacies are limited. The antibacterial activities of five commercially available silver-coated/impregnated dressings were compared against nine common burn-wound pathogens, namely methicillin-sensitive and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus vulgaris, Acinetobacter baumannii and a multi-drug-efflux-positive Acinetobacter baumannii (BM4454), using a broth culture method. The rapidity and extent of killing of these pathogens under in vitro conditions were evaluated. All five silver-impregnated dressings investigated exerted bactericidal activity, particularly against Gram-negative bacteria, including Enterobacter species, Proteus species and E. coli. The spectrum and rapidity of action, however, ranged widely for different dressings. Acticoat and Contreet had a broad spectrum of bactericidal activities against both Gram-positive and -negative bacteria. Contreet was characterized by a very rapid bactericidal action and achieved a reduction of > or =10,000 c.f.u. ml(-1) in the first 30 min for Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumanii. Other dressings demonstrated a narrower range of bactericidal activities. Understanding the characteristics of these dressings may enable them to be targeted more appropriately according to the specific requirements for use of a particular dressing, as in for prophylaxis in skin grafting or for an infected wound with MRSA.
TI  - Flavonoid analysis and antimicrobial activity of commercially available propolis  products.
AB  - Propolis ethanolic solutions are the most used propolis products on the market for the treatment of minor ulcers in the mouth, angina, thrush or skin infections. Since it is still an unofficial drug in pharmacy, we analyzed the contents of flavonoids in ten commercially available ethanolic solutions of propolis from the Croatian market using two complementary colorimetric methods. Antimicrobial activities, determined with the diffusion method, against six bacterial species (Bacillus subtilis NCTC 8236, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Streptococcus pyogenes ATCC 12204, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Escherichia coli ATCC 10536, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, and one yeast-like fungus Candida albicans ATCC 10231 were compared. Results of flavonoids analysis suggested that the contents of flavones and flavonols in the products were uniform and ranged from 0.14 to 0.41%, but the content of flavanones varied greatly from 0.43 to 18.78%. Total flavonoid content, as the sum of two colorimetric methods, in propolis products was between 0.78 and 18.92%, and most products had the flavonoids content below 9%. All products with the total flavonoids content above 1% showed antimicrobial activity against the four Gram-positive bacterial species tested, and against P. aeruginosa and the yeast-like fungus C. albicans. Total flavonoids contents, expressed as the sum of two colorimetric methods, could be useful methods for estimating the flavonoid contents of propolis products. Our results indicate that the quality of commercially available propolis products requires verification.
TI  - Effect of triclosan on the development of bacterial biofilms by urinary tract pathogens on urinary catheters.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine (i) the effect of triclosan on the formation of catheter biofilms by urinary tract pathogens and (ii) the diffusion of triclosan through the retention balloons of urinary catheters. METHODS: Models of the catheterized bladder were infected with eight different urinary tract pathogens and the effect of triclosan on biofilm formation was assessed by determining the numbers of viable cells colonizing the catheters and by scanning electron microscopy. HPLC was used to determine the triclosan concentration in urine draining from models that had been fitted with triclosan-inflated silicone catheters. RESULTS: When catheters were inflated with triclosan (10 g/L) the formation of catheter biofilm by Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and Proteus mirabilis was prevented. The numbers of Enterococcus faecalis and Providencia stuartii cells colonizing catheters were also significantly reduced (P<0.05). Serratia marcescens, Morganella morganii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, however, were able to produce extensive catheter biofilms in the presence of triclosan. Only P. mirabilis produced alkaline urine and encrusted the catheters. Concentrations of 0.02-0.16 mg/L of the biocide were detected in urine draining from the model over the 48 h experimental period. CONCLUSIONS: Triclosan diffused through silicone catheter balloons and produced urinary concentrations that prevented catheter encrustation by P. mirabilis and biofilm formation by several other common pathogens of the catheterized urinary tract. It had little effect on urease-producing P. aeruginosa, S. marcescens or M. morganii but these species did not produce alkaline urine or crystalline biofilms.
TI  - Acquired antimicrobial resistance in the intestinal microbiota of diverse cat populations.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of acquired antimicrobial resistance in the resident intestinal microbiota of cats and to identify significant differences between various cat populations. Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, E. faecium and Streptococcus canis were isolated as faecal indicator bacteria from rectal swabs of 47 individually owned cats, 47 cattery cats and 18 hospitalised cats, and submitted through antimicrobial sensitivity tests. The results revealed that bacteria isolated from hospitalised and/or cattery cats were more frequently resistant than those from individually owned cats. E. coli isolates from hospitalised cats were particularly resistant to ampicillin, tetracycline and sulfonamide. Both enterococci and streptococci showed high resistance to tetracycline and in somewhat lesser extent to erythromycin and tylosin. Most E. faecium isolates were resistant to lincomycin and penicillin. One E. faecalis as well as one E. faecium isolate from hospitalised cats showed 'high-level resistance' (MIC > 500 microg/ml) against gentamicin, a commonly used antimicrobial agent in case of human enterococcal infections. The results of this research demonstrate that the extent of acquired antimicrobial resistance in the intestinal microbiota of cats depends on the social environment of the investigated population. It is obvious that the flora of healthy cats may act as a reservoir of resistance genes.
TI  - Evaluation of antimicrobial activity of Cleome viscosa and Gmelina asiatica.
AB  - The ethanolic extracts of the leaves and flowers of Cleome viscosa and roots of Gmelina asiatica were tested for antimicrobial activity. The two plants exhibited a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity, particularly significative against Escherichia coli , Proteus vulgaris and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The leaf extract of C. viscosa showed moderate activity against pathogenic fungi.
TI  - Ability of the heparan sulfate proteoglycan syndecan-1 to participate in bacterial translocation across the intestinal epithelial barrier.
AB  - Although hundreds of microbial species reside in the human intestinal tract, comparatively few (e.g., Escherichia coli and other enterobacteria, Enterococcus faecalis, etc.) are typically associated with systemic infection in postsurgical, shock, and trauma patients. Syndecan-1 is the predominant cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan expressed on epithelia, and there is substantial evidence that heparan sulfate participates in interactions of a variety of frankly pathogenic microbes with mammalian cells. To investigate the role of syndecan-1 in interactions of enteric flora with intestinal epithelium, bacteria that might use the enterocyte as a portal of entry for systemic infection (including E. faecalis, E. coli, and other enterobacteria, and several species of staphylococci and streptococci) were studied for their abilities to interact with syndecan-1. Streptococcus bovis, S. agalactiae, S. pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, and S. epidermidis showed increased adherence to ARH-77 cells transfected to express syndecan-1. Heparin, a heparan sulfate analog, inhibited internalization of S. bovis, S. agalactiae, S. pyogenes, and S. aureus by HT-29 enterocytes (prominent syndecan-1 expression), but not Caco-2 enterocytes (relatively low syndecan-1 expression). Data from experiments with Chinese hamster ovary cells with altered glycosaminoglycan expression indicated that heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate (glycosaminoglycans on the syndecan-1 ectodomain) participated in bacterial interactions with mammalian cells. Thus, although E. faecalis, E. coli, and other gram-negative enterobacteria did not appear to interact with syndecan-1, this heparan sulfate proteoglycan may mediate enterocyte interactions with some staphylococci and streptococci that are known to cause systemic infections in specific populations of high-risk, immunosuppressed, postsurgical, and trauma patients.
TI  - Value of counting white blood cells (WBC) in semen samples to predict the presence of bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the correlation between the presence of white blood cells (WBC) without the use of specific stain to differentiate leukocytes and the presence of bacteria in semen samples of infertile men. METHODS: A total of 143 semen samples of men who attended an andrologic clinic for the evaluation of fertility were investigated using routine semen analysis (according to WHO laboratory guidelines) and bacterial culture. RESULTS: WBC were found in 43.4% (62/143). There were no WBC in 56.6% (81/143) of the samples (group I) while WBC were found in 43.4% (62/143) of the samples (group II). Pathogenic bacteria were detected in 48.2% (39/81) in group I and in 54.9% (34/62) in group II, all in all Bacteriospermia was present in 51.1% (73/143). The most common bacteria were Ureaplasma urealyticum, Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli (23.8%, 16.8%, and 7.0% of samples, respectively). The sensitivity/specificity for detecting bacteria was 0.47/0.60 at a cut-off level of 0.25 Mio/mL WBC and 0.16/0.84 at a cut-off level of WBC 1 Mio/mL, representing likelihood ratios of 1.16 and 1.04, respectively. The greatest ratio between sensitivity and specificity (0.37/0.72) was found at a cut-off level of 0.5 Mio/mL WBC, with a likelihood ratio of 1.29. CONCLUSIONS: Counting WBC instead of a specific stain for the detection of leukocytes has only a poor sensitivity/specificity for the detection of bacteria.
TI  - Slaughterhouse survey of pyelonephritis in dairy cows.
AB  - Twenty-one rejected kidneys from 2426 slaughtered dairy cows (0.87 per cent) had  gross signs of pyelonephritis that were confirmed by histopathology. In all the kidneys the findings were consistent with a chronic rather than an acute infection. One species of bacteria was cultured from 12 of the kidneys and two species of bacteria were cultured from six. The most commonly isolated bacteria were Escherichia coli, from eight kidneys, Arcanobacterium pyogenes, from seven kidneys and Corynebacterium renale, from five kidneys. The other bacteria cultured were Corynebacterium cystitidis, Corynebacterium species, Streptococcus species group G and Enterococcus faecalis. E. coli was cultured from all the kidneys from which two species were isolated; the accompanying bacteria were A. pyogenes in three kidneys, C. renale in two and C. cystitidis in one. No bacteria were cultured from two of the kidneys and no significant bacteria were cultured from another. The kidneys with pyelonephritis were slightly larger than a comparison group of 72 kidneys without nephritis.
TI  - Changing face of septicaemia and increasing drug resistance in blood isolates.
AB  - In a retrospective study conducted between January, 2000 and December 2000, 7157  adults and children were studied. Amongst these, 1071 patients had positive blood cultures. Of these, 575 (53.6%) cases were community acquired septicaemia and 486 (46.4%) cases had developed septicaemia of nosocomial origin. Gram negative aerobes accounted for 708 (66.1%) isolates. Amongst them, Klebsiella pneumoniae predominated (23%), followed by Escherichia coli (14%). Acinetobacter spp. emerged as the next common pathogen (9%), followed by Salmonella typhi (5.4%). Staphylococcus aureus (9%) and coagulase negative staphylococci (9%) were the most common gram positive isolates followed by Enterococcus faecalis (4.7%). Antibiotic susceptibility of all these isolates was performed by the modified Stokes' method. Both Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli showed alarmingly high resistance to all groups of antibiotics with 70-80% resistance to amoxicillin and cephalexin. Minimum resistance was observed against cefotaxime (23%) and ciprofloxacin (12%). Majority of Enterococcus faecalis were multidrug resistant. Streptococcus pneumoniae exhibited 26% resistance to penicillin. Thus, the study clearly highlights the rising level of drug resistance amongst the bacterial isolates from blood and hence the need to update and formulate newer drug policies.
TI  - Bacterial etiology of acute otitis media and clinical efficacy of amoxicillin-clavulanate versus azithromycin.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Acute otitis media (AOM) is one of the most common acute bacterial infection in childhood and also the most frequent reason for outpatient antibiotic therapy. Little recent information about susceptibility patterns of AOM bacterial pathogens in Turkish children has been reported. OBJECTIVE: To determine the bacterial etiology of acute otitis media in children and to compare the efficiency of 3 days course of azithromycin with a 10 days course of amoxicillin-clavulanate. METHODS: This prospective, single blind, randomised comparative study was carried out in 180 children with AOM. Paracentesis was performed for middle ear fluid culture before the first dose antibiotic therapy. Children with acute otitis media were randomised to receive either low dose amoxicillin-clavulanate (45/6.4 mg/kg/day in two divided doses for 10 days) or low dose azithromycin (10mg/kg/day for 3 days). Clinical response was assessed on days 2-4, 11-13, 26-28. RESULTS: Bacterial pathogens were isolated from 108 (60%) of 180 children. Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most common isolated pathogen (39.7%), followed by Haemophilus influenzae (20.7%), Moraxella catarrhalis (15.5%), Staphylococcus aureus (13.8%), Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (5.1%), Escherichia coli (3.4%) and Enterococcus faecalis (1.7%). This study demonstrated low resistance rates compared to studies of different countries. Although clinical response rates were better in patients treated with amoxicillin-clavulanate, this was not statistically significant [86.6% (78 of 90)] versus [95.2% (80 of 84)]. Success rates of amoxicillin-clavulanate were high for both S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae. Difference between success rates was not statistically significant (P=0.144 and 0.352). CONCLUSIONS: Bacteria were isolated in 60% of AOM cases. The clinical efficiency of amoxicillin-clavulanate was found to be equal compared to azithromycin in children with acute otitis media.
TI  - Correlation between the genetic diversity of nosocomial pathogens and their survival time in intensive care units.
AB  - Bacteria differ in their ability to survive in the hospital environment outside the human host. Species remaining viable and infectious have a higher chance of being transmitted, giving them a fitness advantage in hospitals. This differential fitness could be expected to alter the genetic population structure of bacterial populations in hospitals, and should be reflected by the relative abundance of several successful clones. The objective of this study was to test for a potential correlation between tenacity, i.e. environmental survival, and clonal abundance determined by the genetic diversity in different bacterial species from prospectively collected isolates of intensive care patients. A literature review was performed to identify mean environmental survival times for the most important pathogens in intensive care units (ICUs): Staphylococcus aureus, enterococci, Acetinobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter spp., Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. To determine the genetic diversity of the natural population of these species in ICUs, a prospective 18-month study was conducted in five units with median nosocomial infection rates. All clinical isolates were collected, and highly discriminatory DNA fingerprinting techniques were used to identify specific clones. A diversity index for each species was calculated as the number of distinguishable genotypes in the population divided by size. The correlation between survival times and the diversity indices for the individual pathogens was investigated using non-parametric methods. Although 21 studies were identified in the literature, only two were relevant. They showed median survival times between 1.5 days (P. aeruginosa) and 60.0 days (Enterococcus faecium). During the prospective ICU study, 1264 pathogens were investigated and simple diversity indices between 49.1 (Enterococcus faecalis) and 89.8 (E. coli) were found. A correlation between survival times and the diversity indices for the individual pathogens was found (correlation coefficient 0.821, P=0.024). Environmental survival may be an important factor contributing to the ecological fitness of some nosocomial pathogens in ICUs. Infection control measures should consider this finding.
TI  - Development of a rapid method for simultaneous recovery of diverse microbes in drinking water by ultrafiltration with sodium polyphosphate and surfactants.
AB  - The ability to simultaneously concentrate diverse microbes is an important consideration for sample collection methods that are used for emergency response and environmental monitoring when drinking water may be contaminated with an array of unknown microbes. This study focused on developing a concentration method using ultrafilters and different combinations of a chemical dispersant (sodium polyphosphate [NaPP]) and surfactants. Tap water samples were seeded with bacteriophage MS2, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Cryptosporidium parvum, 4.5-microm microspheres, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Bacillus globigii endospores, and echovirus 1. Ten-liter tap water samples were concentrated to approximately 250 ml in 12 to 42 min, depending on the experimental condition. Initial experiments indicated that pretreating filters with fetal bovine serum or NaPP resulted in an increase in microbe recovery. The addition of NaPP to the tap water samples resulted in significantly higher microbe and microsphere recovery efficiencies. Backflushing of the ultrafilter was found to significantly improve recovery efficiencies. The effectiveness of backflushing was improved further with the addition of Tween 80 to the backflush solution. The ultrafiltration method developed in this study, incorporating the use of NaPP pretreatment and surfactant solution backflushing, was found to recover MS2, C. parvum, microspheres, and several bacterial species with mean recovery efficiencies of 70 to 93%. The mean recovery efficiency for echovirus 1 (49%) was the lowest of the microbes studied for this method. This research demonstrates that ultrafiltration can be effective for recovering diverse microbes simultaneously in tap water and that chemical dispersants and surfactants can be beneficial for improving microbial recovery using this technique.
TI  - Methylene blue in the evaluation of gastrointestinal tract integrity: potential limitations.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The integrity of the gastrointestinal tract can be evaluated by oral or rectal application of methylene blue. In the presence of anastomotic leaks or fistulas, methylene blue can be recovered in adjacent drains. However, parts of the dye can biochemically be reduced by intestinal bacteria to its colorless form leucomethylene blue, limiting the prediction of the test. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Diluted methylene blue was added to different concentrations of bacterial suspensions of Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis. The time for discoloration of the suspension was measured. RESULTS: Reduction of methylene blue to leucomethylene blue was observed in both types of bacterial suspension. A 10(8) bacterial concentration discolorated the dye within 1 h in the E. faecalis suspension, respectively 2.5 h in the E. coli suspension. Longer bacterial interaction with methylene blue reduced the bacterial concentration required to achieve complete discoloration. DISCUSSION: Methylene blue can reliably be used as routine diagnostic test for the assessment of upper gastrointestinal integrity, where bacterial load is low. In the lower gastrointestinal tract, where bacterial load is generally higher, the dye can indicate leaks, only if extended intestinal passage after oral ingestion is avoided. In all other cases, the examiner has to be aware of false-negative results by bacterial discoloration of methylene blue.
TI  - Pathogen occurrence and antimicrobial susceptibility of urinary tract infection cases during a 20-year period (1983-2002) at a single institution in Japan.
AB  - Urinary tract infections are one of the most common infectious diseases diagnosed in outpatients as well as in hospitalized patients. Recently, urinary tract infections have become more complicated and difficult to treat. Therefore, the present study analyzed the occurrence and antimicrobial susceptibility of uropathogens isolated at Kobe University Hospital between 1983 and 2002. This study was performed with three patient groups: urology inpatients, urology outpatients, and inpatients of other departments. During the 20-year study period, we studied 15,925 urine isolates obtained from those patients who were diagnosed with urinary tract infection. Overall, Enterococcus faecalis was the most frequently isolated pathogen, followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli. The frequency of Staphylococcus aureus increased over time, corresponding to an increase in the occurrence of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). In addition, the rate of isolation of Serratia marcescens also increased over time, especially among patients with urinary tract catheters. Our results demonstrate that the uropathogens isolated at a single institution have shown a trend of increasing resistance to various classes of antimicrobial agents. In addition, serious problems should be anticipated in the treatment of multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa, fluoroquinolone-resistant E. coli, and arbekacin-resistant MRSA.
TI  - Discovery of a biologically active thiostrepton fragment.
AB  - Design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of several domains of the thiopeptide antibiotic thiostrepton led to the discovery of a biologically active fragment. The biological properties of this novel small organic molecule include antibiotic activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (VREF) bacterial strains, as well as cytotoxic action against a number of cancer cell lines.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of 10-isobutyryloxy-8,9-epoxythymol isobutyrate.
AB  - 10-Isobutyryloxy-8,9-epoxythymol isobutyrate was found to be a major constituent  of Inula helenium and Inula royleana root cultures. The compound showed moderate antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherischia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans.
TI  - Pentadactylin: an antimicrobial peptide from the skin secretions of the South American bullfrog Leptodactylus pentadactylus.
AB  - Norepinephrine-stimulated skin secretions were obtained from male specimens of the South American bullfrog, Leptodactylus pentadactylus and shown to contain two peptides that inhibited the growth of microorganisms. The primary structure of a previously undescribed peptide, termed pentadactylin, was established as Gly-Leu-Leu-Asp-Thr-Leu-Lys-Gly-Ala-Ala-Lys-Asn-Val-Val-Gly-Ser-Leu-Ala-Ser-Lys-V al-Met-Glu-Lys-Leu.NH2. The second peptide, which differs from pentadactylin by eight amino acid residues, is identical to fallaxin previously isolated from skin secretions of the Caribbean mountain chicken frog L. fallax. Pentadactylin inhibited the growth of reference strains of both Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus group B) but potencies were relatively low (MIC values in the range 25-200 microM). The peptide showed very low hemolytic activity against human erythrocytes (LD50>400 microM).
TI  - [Therapeutic management of peritonitis].
AB  - Antibiotherapy is a fundamental for the treatment of peritonitis. It may be used  before surgery or as a complementary treatment after. Experimental models have demonstrated that infections are both aerobic and anaerobic. During the first stage, septicemic with a high death rate, the infection is due to enterobacteria, mostly Escherichia coli. Between D5 and D7 in surviving animals, there is a second stage with abscesses due to anaerobic bacteria, mostly Bacteroides fragilis. The antibiotic treatment must include these two types of bacteria in its spectrum. The role of Enterococcus faecalis is not clearly defined, but this bacterium must be taken into account in case of organ failure or associated septic shock. Treatment options for secondary peritonitis may be, according to severity, cefoxitin, an Augmentin + gentamycin combination, Tazocillin, or ertapenem. The reference treatment for nosocomial or tertiary peritonitis is the imipenem + amikacin combination. An antifungal treatment (fluconazole) is usually necessary, at least until the results of peritoneal fluid culture are available. The duration of treatment is quite variable, ranging from 48 h in less severe forms to 14 days.
TI  - Determination of nucleotide sequence related to the plasmid replication region in Enterococcus faecalis and its application to a new shuttle vector.
AB  - The 5.1-kb plasmid pAMalpha1delta2, a derivative of the 9.6-kb plasmid pAMalpha1  which is harbored by Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 14508, has a region necessary for replication in E. faecalis. The nucleotide sequence related to the replication region in pAMalpha1delta2 was determined and found to contain an open reading frame of 720-bp encoding a replication protein. The sequence showed 54.5 and 48.5% homology to those encoding the RepAs of plasmids pLA103 from Lactobacillus acidophilus and pFA3 from Neisseria gonorrhoeae, respectively. A recombinant 5.8-kb plasmid, pEFX6, which can be used as a shuttle vector between Escherichia coli and some strains of E. faecalis, was constructed by combining the tetracycline resistance gene of pAMalpha1delta2 and the replication regions of pAMalpha1delta2 and pUC18 for E. faecalis and E. coli, respectively. This shuttle vector was successfully used to clone and express the gelatinase gene from E. faecalis subsp. zymogenes IFO 3989 in E. faecalis C57, a strain showing no gelatinase activity.
TI  - Synthesis and evaluation of analgesic/ anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial activities of 3-substituted- 1,2,4-triazole-5-thiones.
AB  - In this study, the synthesis of a novel series of Mannich bases of 5-mercapto-3-aryl-1,2,4-triazoles is described. The structures attributed to compounds la-5e were elucidated using IR and 1H-NMR spectroscopic techniques besides elemental analysis. The formation of 1-aminomethyl-3-substituted-1,2,4-triazole-5-thiones - not the isomeric 3-substituted-4-aminomethyl-1,2,4-triazole-5-thiones was unambiguously confirmed by X-ray crystallographic analysis of 1c. The compounds were examined for their in vivo anti-inflammatory and analgesic activity in two different bioassays, namely carrageenan-induced hind paw edema and p-benzoquinone-induced abdominal constriction tests in mice, respectively. In addition, the ulcerogenic effects of the compounds were determined. Among the tested derivatives most promising results were obtained for the compounds bearing a nonsubstituted phenyl group at C-3 position of the triazole ring (1a-e). The compounds were also evaluated for their in vitro antimicrobial activity against a series of gram positive bacteria [Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 29213), Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29212)], gram negative bacteria [Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853)] and yeast-like microorganisms [Candida albicans (ATCC 90028), C. krusei (ATCC 6258), C. parapsilosis (ATCC 22019)]. One series of the examined compounds (3a-e) exhibited better antibacterial activity especially against gram positive bacteria than against gram negative bacteria. Compounds 2c, 3b, and 3e were found to be more effective against C. parapsilosis compared with the other derivatives (MIC: 16 microg/mL).
TI  - Bloodstream infections in pediatric patients.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Blood stream infection (BSI) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in pediatric patients. This study aims to describe the clinical, microbiological characteristics and outcome of BSI in pediatric patients. METHODS: We collected the clinical data from all pediatric patients with positive blood cultures. We identified all isolates from these patients from January 2004 to December 2004 at King Khalid University Hospital (KKUH), Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, and determined antimicrobial susceptibilities by MicroScan Walk Away 96 (Dade Behring Inc., West Sacramento, CA95691, USA). RESULTS: Two hundred and twenty pediatric patients had BSI, of whom 147 (67%) were males and 71 (32.2%) were from intensive care units (ICUs). Two hundred and ten (95.4%) had single blood culture isolate. One hundred and seventy-three (78.6%) of the isolates were Gram positive bacteria and included the following: Staphylococcus epidermidis (55.4%), Staphylococcus aureus (9.5%) of which 14% were methicillin resistant, Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae) (4.5%), 40% of which were resistant to penicillin and Enterococcus faecalis (4%). Gram negative bacteria were 44 (20%) and included Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae (K.pneumoniae) (3.6% each). Three isolates (1.3%) were Candida glabrata. None of the Gram positive isolates were vancomycin resistant. Three K.pneumoniae and one Pseudomonas spp. isolates were multiresistant. One hundred and ninety-four (88%) of BSI isolates were hospital acquired. Fever was the most common presentation of pediatric patients (26%) with positive blood culture with no apparent focus of infection. Respiratory tract infections 26 (12%) were the next most common. We seen sepsis in (7.7%) children between 8 days and 6 months of age. Bone and joint infections, cardiac, renal, gastrointestinal diseases, malignancy and surgical cases were other associated clinical diagnoses of BSI in pediatric patients. Patients with immuno- suppressive disorders with BSI had isolates such as Salmonella spp., S. pneumoniae and Pseudomonas spp. Overall mortality was 13 (6%) (p<0.005) and those patients had underlying serious medical conditions with associated risk factors such as prolonged hospital stay, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, indwelling catheterization, mechanical ventilation and prior antimicrobial use. CONCLUSION: Bloodstream infection is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in pediatric patients. Risk factors for hospital acquired infection include: prematurity, prolonged hospitalization, ICU admission, indwelling catheterization, mechanical ventilation and prior antimicrobial therapy.
TI  - Spectrum and antibiotic resistance of uropathogens isolated from hospital and community patients with urinary tract infections in two large hospitals in Kuwait.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the spectrum of microbial etiology and antibiotic resistance pattern of the uropathogens that cause urinary tract infections in 2 large teaching hospitals in Kuwait over a period of 1 year. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Vitek identification card system was used to identify the uropathogens. Susceptibility of the isolates against 18 antibiotics was performed by the microbroth dilution method using the Vitek automated system. In addition, gram-positive bacteria were tested in parallel by the disk diffusion technique. RESULTS: The six overall most common isolates were: Escherichia coli, accounting for 47% of isolates in both hospitals, followed by Candida spp. (10.8%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (9.6%), Streptococcus agalactiae (GBS; 9.5%), Enterococcus faecalis (4.2%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4.1%). Amikacin provided the widest coverage amongst all the antibiotics tested followed by ciprofloxacin, gentamicin and piperacillin-tazobactam. For the gram-negatives, high resistance (26-63%) to the beta-lactam antibiotics was noted, especially to ampicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cephalothin and cefuroxime. Resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was also high. None of the enterococci was resistant to the glycopeptides, but 38-60% of the Staphylococcus haemolyticus were resistant to vancomycin or teicoplanin. CONCLUSION: These data show the high level of antimicrobial resistance amongst the uropathogens causing urinary tract infection in the two hospitals studied.
TI  - [Pathogenic characters of infected bacteria after liver transplantation].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the main pathogens of infection after the liver transplantation and their antibiotic resistant patterns. METHODS: The main pathogens of infection after the liver transplantation were retrospectively analyzed. Using 3-dimensional tests, ESBLs (extended-spectrum beta-lactamase), and AmpC were detected among the Gram negative bacilli. beta-Lactamase and Van gene in Enterococcus were determined by the standard agar dilution susceptibility tests and Nitrocefin respectively. RESULTS: The main infected strains were Enterococcus faecalis (15.0%), Enterobacter cloacae (13.9%), fungus (13.3%), and Escherichia coli (10.7%) after the liver transplantation. Among them, 32.4% of Enterobacter cloacae and 36.8% of Escherichia coli produced ESBLs; 33.8% of Enterobacter cloacae and 10.5% of Escherichia coli. produced AmpC beta-lactamases. The detectable rate of VanA gene in Enterococcusfaecalis and Enterococcus faecium was 7.5% and 11.1%; VanB was 3.8% and 7.4%; VanC was 1.3% and 0, respectively. CONCLUSION: The infection mainly occurs in the intestinal tract after the liver transplantation. The production of ESBLs and AmpC beta-lactamases is the main mechanism of antibiotic resistance. The increased detectable rate of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus should be paid attention to.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of SM-216601, a new broad-spectrum  parenteral carbapenem.
AB  - SM-216601 is a novel parenteral 1beta-methylcarbapenem. In agar dilution susceptibility testing, the MIC of SM-216601 for 90% of the methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains tested (MIC(90)) was 2 microg/ml, which was comparable to those of vancomycin and linezolid. SM-216601 was also very potent against Enterococcus faecium, including vancomycin-resistant strains (MIC(90) = 8 microg/ml). SM-216601 exhibited potent activity against penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis, with MIC(90)s of less than 0.5 microg/ml, and intermediate activity against Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The therapeutic efficacy of SM-216601 against experimentally induced infections in mice caused by S. aureus, E. faecium, E. coli, and P. aeruginosa reflected its in vitro activity and plasma level. Thus, SM-216601 is a promising candidate for nosocomial bacterial infections caused by a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including multiresistant pathogens.
TI  - Bacteriology of surgical wound infections in a tertiary care hospital in Turkey.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the spectrum of the pathogens cultured from surgical wound infections and assess their antimicrobial drug resistances. DESIGN: Laboratory-based retrospective study for the five year period. SETTING: A four hundred bed, tertiary-care university hospital in Turkey. RESULTS: Overall 621 pathogens were identified from January 1999 to January 2004. Of these isolates, 431 (69%) were gram-positive, 178 (29%) were gram-negative bacteria and also 12 (2%) were identified as Candida albicans. The most common organism was Staphylococcus aureus (50%), followed by Escherichia coli (8%), Streptococcus pyogenes (7%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (6%), Enterococcus faecalis (4%), Enterobacter spp. (4%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (3%), Acinetobacter spp. (3%), Proteus spp. (3%), group B. B-haemolytic streptococci (2%), Candida albicans (2%), and Citrobacter spp. (1%). The rate of resistance to methicillin in staphylococci and multidrug resistance in S. aureus were 31% and 12%, respectively. There was no increase in resistance to methicillin by years. Piperacillin/tazobactam, sefoperazone/sulbactam, carbapenems, ofloxacin and amikacin were the most active agents against gram-negative isolates. The rates of extended spectrum beta-lactamase production in K. pneumoniae and E. coli strains were determined as 14%, and 6%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is emerging as a major pathogen in surgical wound infections. We concluded that antimicrobial treatment of surgical wound infections should include empiric coverage for MRSA. The surveillance of resistance in pathogens causing surgical wound infections is necessary to promote the appropriate therapeutic choices for these infections.
TI  - Purple urine bag syndrome in a hemodialysis patient.
AB  - Purple urine bag syndrome (PUBS) is an uncommon disorder, in which the plastic disposable urinary catheter bag turns purple or blue following hours or days of urinary catheterization. The purple discoloration results from indirubin dissolved in the plastic mixing with indigo in the urine. Bacteria possessing indoxyl sulfatase degrade indoxyl sulfate into indirubin and indigo. Indoxyl sulfate is derived from the metabolism of tryptophan. PUBS usually occurs in chronic catheterized elderly women who are constipated and poorly ambulant. The clinical course is benign and rarely causes sepsis. This investigation reports a 61-year-old female diabetic patient with end-stage renal disease on maintenance hemodialysis, who had two episodes of blue or purple urine bag discoloration. The urine culture of the first episode yielded Klebsiella pneumoniae, whereas that of the second episode yielded Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, and Proteus vulgaris. Both episodes resolved following oral antibiotics treatment and placement of new foley catheters. To our knowledge, this is the first recorded case of PUBS in a dialysis patient.
TI  - Intestinal protozoa and associated bacteria in captive houbara bustards (Chlamydotis undulata) in the United Arab Emirates.
AB  - A protozoal survey was carried out in 114 captive houbara bustards (Chlamydotis undulata) in the United Arab Emirates. Trichomonas gallinarum, Chilomastix gallinarum, Giardia spp. and Lophomonas spp. were detected from faecal samples of 49 (43%) captive houbara bustards. Culture and identification studies were carried out to assess associated bacteria. The bacteria isolated from birds negative to protozoa included Enterococcus spp., Aerococcus spp., Micrococci spp., Proteus spp., Enterobacter spp., Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp., while Enterococcus spp., Micrococci kristinae, Aerococcus spp., Staphylococcus sciuri, Staphylococcus aureus, E. coli, Klebsiella spp. and Alcaligenes faecalis were isolated from protozoa positive birds. Proteus spp., Enterobacter spp., E. coli , Klebsiella spp., Aerococcus spp. and Enterococcus spp. are considered part of the normal intestinal bacterial flora of captive bustards and they were also isolated from the food items used to feed the captive bustards. S. sciuri possibly originated from ingested mice; Alcaligenes faecalis and Micrococcus spp. are contaminants from soil or water.
TI  - Analysis of antibiotic susceptibility and resistance of leg ulcer bacterial flora in patients hospitalized at Dermatology Department, Poznan University Hospital.
AB  - Effective treatment of frequently infected, poorly healing wounds such as leg ulcers due to chronic venous insufficiency poses a major clinical problem. Antibiotic resistance in dermatology patients, especially those with non-healing leg ulcers, is a widespread phenomenon. Various antibiotics, mainly broad-spectrum agents, are frequently and sometimes inappropriately prescribed, which often leads to the selection of antibiotic-resistant bacteria strains. The aim of this study was to analyze antibiotic susceptibility and resistance of bacterial isolates cultured from leg ulcers. Wound swabs were obtained from patients admitted to Dermatology Department, Poznan University of Medical Sciences, during the 1998-2002 period. Bacteriologic diagnosis of 175 wound swabs was performed in compliance with compulsory laboratory methods. The analysis yielded 173 positive results, predominated by Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli. Bacterial isolates were evaluated for resistance to commonly used antibiotics, taking into consideration the presence of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains. Antibiotic resistance profiles were compared between the years 1998 and 2002, with detailed account of clinical characteristics and history of leg ulcers disease. The study pointed to an increasing tendency of antibiotic resistance in the study group of patients.
TI  - Bacterial flora of leg ulcers in patients admitted to Department of Dermatology,  Poznan University of Medical Sciences, during the 1998-2002 period.
AB  - Venous leg ulcers are an important cause of morbidity in a significant percentage of the world population. The percentage of leg ulceration, either active or healed, in the European population is about 1%-2%. The aim of this study was to analyze the rate of colonization and qualitative composition of the bacterial flora isolated from leg ulcers in patients admitted to Dermatology Department, Poznan University of Medical Sciences, during the 1998-2002 period, with special reference to the infection risk factors. Bacteriological diagnosis of 175 wound swabs was performed in compliance with compulsory laboratory methods. In 173 positive results, the predominant culture composition included Staphylococcus aureus (56.57%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (37.14%), Enterococcus faecalis (22.29%), Proteus mirabilis (13.71%) and Escherichia coli (12.57%). There was a significant increase in the incidence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli, along with a decrease in the incidence of Staphylococcus aureus isolation during the study period. The rate of yeast-like fungi strains, mainly Candida albicans, recorded in culture composition showed a systematic increase. Changes in the qualitative and quantitative composition of bacterial flora, presence of multiple isolates, and concomitant diseases that may influence the characteristics of leg ulcer disease were closely monitored.
TI  - [Bacterial flora and mycosis of the vagina in women with symptoms of vaginal inflammation].
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To estimate the microbiological profile of vaginal flora in 30 women  with gynecologic problems and 20 pregnant women complaining about pathological symptoms {pruritus, burning, vaginal discharge}. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The discharge from posterior vaginal vault was examined microbiologically on the Columbia Agar with sheep blood, MacConkey and Sabourand cultures incubated of 48 hours in the temperature of 37 degrees C. RESULTS: Bacterial infections were detected in 33 cases (66%), 12 of these women (24%) lived in urban, 21 (42%) in rural environment. From bacteria isolated from the vagina, most often because at 14 women stepped out Streptococcus agalactiae, at 11 Enterococcus faecalis at 8 Escherichia coli. In 5 cases bacterial inflammation was caused by two kinds of bacterium. At two women stepped out both Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli. In single cases it was Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus vulgaris, Escherichia coli and Streptococcus agalactiae. In all cases of inflammation mycosis was called out by from Candida albicans. One ascertained it at 14 among all given an examination women. Mixed inflammations called out both by mycosis and bacterial stepped out in 3 cases in age of 21-30. At two women it was Candida albicans and Streptococcus agalactiae, at one inflammation mycosis accompanied Enterococcus faecalis. CONCLUSIONS: The common reason of vaginitis are bacterial infections caused by Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis, E coli. Both, place of living and women' s age influence the type of etiological factor.
TI  - Molecular analysis of colonized bacteria in a human newborn infant gut.
AB  - The complex ecosystem of intestinal microflora is estimated to harbor approximately 400 different microbial species, mostly bacteria. However, studies on bacterial colonization have mostly been based on culturing methods, which only detect a small fraction of the whole microbiotic ecosystem of the gut. To clarify the initial acquisition and subsequent colonization of bacteria in an infant within the few days after birth, phylogenetic analysis was performed using 16S rDNA sequences from the DNA isolated from feces on the 1st, 3rd, and 6th day. 16S rDNA libraries were constructed with the amplicons of PCR conditions at 30 cycles and 50 degrees c annealing temperature. Nine independent libraries were produced by the application of three sets of primers (set A, set B, and set C) combined with three fecal samples for day 1, day 3, and day 6 of life. Approximately 220 clones (76.7%) of all 325 isolated clones were characterized as known species, while other 105 clones (32.3%) were characterized as unknown species. The library clone with set A universal primers amplifying 350 bp displayed increased diversity by days. Thus, set A primers were better suited for this type of molecular ecological analysis. On the first day of the life of the infant, Enterobacter, Lactococcus lactis, Leuconostoc citreum, and Streptococcus mitis were present. The largest taxonomic group was L. lactis. On the third day of the life of the infant, Enterobacter, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, S. mitis, and Streptococcus salivarius were present. On the sixth day of the life of the infant, Citrobacter, Clostridium difficile, Enterobacter sp., Enterobacter cloacae, and E. coli were present. The largest taxonomic group was E. coli. These results showed that microbiotic diversity changes very rapidly in the few days after birth, and the acquisition of unculturable bacteria expanded rapidly after the third day.
TI  - Is the use o f Gunnera perpensa extracts in endometritis related to antibacterial activity?
AB  - Rhizome extracts of Gunnera perpensa are used in traditional remedies in South Africa to treat endometritis both in humans and animals. An investigation was undertaken to determine whether this plant possesses antibacterial activity, which may explain its efficacy. Gunnera perpensa rhizome extracts were prepared serially with solvents of increasing polarity and tested for antibacterial activity. Test bacteria included the Gram-positive Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus and the Gram-negative Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. A moderate to weak level of antibacterial activity in most of the extracts resulted, with the best minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) value of 2.61 mg ml(-1) shown by the acetone extract against S. aureus. The extracts were also submitted to the brine shrimp assay to detect possible toxic or pharmacological effects. All the extracts were lethal to the brine shrimp larvae at a concentration of 5 mg ml(-1). The acetone extract was extremely toxic at 1 mg ml(-1), with some toxicity evident at 0.1 mg ml(-1). The remainder of the extracts generally displayed little activity at concentrations lower than 5 mg ml(-1). In summary, the results indicate that although the extracts demonstrated a level of pharmacological activity, the relatively weak antibacterial activity is unlikely to justify the use of G. perpensa rhizomes in the traditional treatment of endometritis. Rather, the slightly antibacterial nature of the rhizomes may contribute to an additive effect, along with their known uterotonic activity, to the overall efficacy of the preparation.
TI  - [Microorganisms isolated from outpatient urine samples and antimicrobial susceptibility over a 12-year period].
AB  - This study aimed to determine the prevalence of microorganisms isolated from urine samples from outpatients and the resistance of the pathogens isolated to antimicrobial agents used in the province of Cordoba, Spain, which has a Health Area of approximately 776,000 inhabitants. It was a retrospective descriptive study covering a 12-year period (1992-2003). All samples were sent from primary care to the microbiology laboratory. The laboratory techniques and criteria for evaluation were the same in all cases. Escherichia coli was the most frequently isolated of the Gram-negative bacteria (64%), while Enterococcus faecalis was the most frequently isolated of the Gram-positive bacteria (6.9%). A decrease in susceptibility of the isolates to the most empirically used antimicrobial drugs was observed.
TI  - Tigecycline MIC testing by broth dilution requires use of fresh medium or addition of the biocatalytic oxygen-reducing reagent oxyrase to standardize the test method.
AB  - Tigecycline is a broad-spectrum glycylcycline antibiotic with activity against not only susceptible gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens but also strains that are resistant to many other antibiotics. In the process of determining quality control (QC) limits for the American Type Culture Collection reference strains for tigecycline, a number of inconsistencies in MICs were encountered which appeared to be related to the age of the Mueller-Hinton broth (MHB) medium used in the MIC testing. The objective of this study was to determine the cause of the discrepant MIC results between fresh and aged MHB. The MICs of tigecycline were determined in MHB that was either prepared fresh (<12 h old), prepared and stored at 4 degrees C, stored at room temperature, stored anaerobically, or supplemented with the biocatalytic oxygen-reducing reagent Oxyrase. When tested in fresh media, tigecycline was 2 to 3 dilutions more active against the CLSI-recommended QC strains compared to aged media (MICs of 0.03 to 0.25 and 0.12 to 0.5 mug/ml, respectively). Media aged under anaerobic conditions prior to testing or supplemented with Oxyrase resulted in MICs similar to those obtained in fresh medium (MICs of 0.03 to 0.12 and 0.03 to 0.25 mug/ml, respectively). Time-kill kinetics demonstrated a >3 log(10) difference in viable growth when tigecycline was tested in fresh or Oxyrase-supplemented MHB compared to aged MHB. High-pressure liquid chromatography analysis revealed the accumulation of an early peak (oxidative by-product of tigecycline) to be 3.5% in fresh media and 25.1% in aged media after 24 h and that addition of Oxyrase prevented the accumulation of this oxidized by-product. These results suggested that the activity of tigecycline was affected by the amount of dissolved oxygen in the media. The use of fresh MHB or supplementation with Oxyrase resulted in a more standardized test method for performing MIC tests with tigecycline.
TI  - A study on inhibitory effects of Sigla tree (Liquidambar orientalis Mill. var. orientalis) storax against several bacteria.
AB  - In this study, Sigla (Liquidambar orientalis Mill.) storax (styrax) was investigated for antibacterial activity against Aeromonas hydrophila, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, B. brevis, B. cereus, B. megaterium, B. subtilis, Corynebacterium xerosis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, E. coli O157:H7, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Listeria monocytogenes, Micrococcus luteus, Mycobacterium smegmatis, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. fluorescens, Staphylococcus aureus and Yersinia enterocolitica. The storax was dissolved in absolute ethanol and was tested at concentrations of 10.0%, 1.0%, 0.4%, 0.2% and 0.1%. Pure ethanol was used for the control. The antibacterial activity of the Sigla storax was determined by using the agar diffusion method. The growths of A. hydrophila, B. amyloliquefaciens, B. megaterium, E. coli, E. coli O157:H7, L. monocytogenes and Y. enterocolitica were not inhibited by any of the concentrations of Sigla storax. The results showed that Sigla storax has antibacterial activity against many bacteria at concentrations of 10.0% and against some bacteria at concentrations of 1.0%, 0.4% and 0.2%.
TI  - Rationale for using Peltophorum africanum (Fabaceae) extracts in veterinary medicine.
AB  - Peltophorum africanum (Fabaceae) is a deciduous tree widespread in southern Africa. The plant has many ethnomedical and ethnoveterinary uses. Root and bark decoctions are used to treat diarrhoea, dysentery, sore throat, wounds, back and joint pains, HIV-AIDS, venereal diseases and infertility. Pastoralists and rural farmers use the root and bark extracts to treat diarrhoea, dysentery, infertility, and to promote well-being and resistance to diseases in cattle. To evaluate these ethnobotanical leads, dried leaves, stem bark and root bark were extracted with ethanol, acetone, dichloromethane and hexane. Polyphenols in the extract were determined by the Folin-Ciocalteu method with gallic acid as standard. Qualitative antioxidant activity was screened by spraying thin layer chromatograms (TLC) of the extracts with 0.2% 1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl hydrazyl (DPPH), and quantified with Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) assay. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and total antibacterial activity (TAA) were determined by serial microplate dilution for Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus faecalis, with gentamicin as standard and tetrazolium violet as growth indicator. Acetone and ethanol extracted the largest quantity of material. Polyphenols concentration was 49.2% in acetone extract of the root and 3.8% in dichloromethane extract of the leaf. Antioxidant activity of at least 5 antioxidant compounds as measured by TEAC ranged from 1.34 (ethanol extract of the root) to 0.01 (hexane extract of the leaf). The total antibacterial activity (volume to which active compounds present in 1 g plant material can be diluted and still inhibit bacterial growth) was 1263 ml/g for ethanol extract of the root against S. aureus, and 800 ml/g for acetone extract of the root against P. aeruginosa. There was substantial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, with MIC values of 0.08 mg/ml for S. aureus and 0.16 mg/ml for P. aeruginosa. There is therefore a rationale for the traditional use of root and bark of P. africanum in treating bacterial infection related diseases.
TI  - Campylobacter spp., Salmonella spp., verocytotoxic Escherichia coli, and antibiotic resistance in indicator organisms in wild cervids.
AB  - Faecal samples were collected, as part of the National Health Surveillance Program for Cervids (HOP) in Norway, from wild red deer, roe deer, moose and reindeer during ordinary hunting seasons from 2001 to 2003. Samples from a total of 618 animals were examined for verocytotoxic E. coli (VTEC); 611 animals for Salmonella and 324 animals for Campylobacter. A total of 50 samples were cultivated from each cervid species in order to isolate the indicator bacterial species E. coli and Enterococcus faecalis / E. faecium for antibiotic resistance pattern studies. Salmonella and the potentially human pathogenic verocytotoxic E. coli were not isolated, while Campylobacter jejuni jejuni was found in one roe deer sample only. Antibiotic resistance was found in 13 (7.3%) of the 179 E. coli isolates tested, eight of these being resistant against one type of antibiotic only. The proportion of resistant E. coli isolates was higher in wild reindeer (24%) than in the other cervids (2.2%). E. faecalis or E. faecium were isolated from 19 of the samples, none of these being reindeer. All the strains isolated were resistant against one (84%) or more (16%) antibiotics. A total of 14 E. faecalis-strains were resistant to virginiamycin only. The results indicate that the cervid species studied do not constitute an important infectious reservoir for either the human pathogens or the antibiotic resistant microorganisms included in the study.
TI  - Enumeration and antibiotic resistance patterns of fecal indicator organisms isolated from migratory Canada geese (Branta canadensis).
AB  - Thermotolerant fecal indicator organisms carried by migratory waterfowl may serve as reservoirs of antibiotic resistance. To determine the extent to which such antibiotic resistance markers were present in migratory Canada geese (Branta canadensis) on the Maryland Eastern Shore, we isolated Enterococcus spp. and Escherichia coli from fresh feces and examined the antibiotic resistance profiles of these bacteria. Samples were obtained in October 2002, January 2003, and March 2003. Thermotolerant E. coli counts ranged from 0 to 1.0x10(7) colony forming units (CFU)/0.1g (g-1) wet weight of feces, whereas Enterococcus spp. counts ranged from 1.0x10(2)-1.0x10(7) CFU g-1 wet weight of feces. Primary isolates of each indicator organism were tested against a panel of 10 antibiotics. Greater than 95% of E. coli isolates were resistant to penicillin G, ampicillin, cephalothin, and sulfathiazole; no E. coli were resistant to ciprofloxacin. Enterococcal isolates showed highest resistance to cephalothin, streptomycin, and sulfathiazole; no enterococci were resistant to chloramphenicol. The tetracyclines, streptomycin, and gentamycin provided the greatest discrimination among E. coli isolates; chlortetracycline, cephalothin, and gentamycin resistance patterns provided the greatest discrimination between enterococcal strains. Multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR) profiles were calculated: fall (E. coli=0.499; enterococci=0.234), winter (E. coli=0.487; enterococci=0.389), and spring (E. coli=0.489; enterococci=0.348). E. faecalis and E. faecium, which are recognized human nosocomial pathogens, were cultured from winter (44 and 56%, respectively) and spring (13 and 31%, respectively) fecal samples.
TI  - Solid- and vapor-phase antimicrobial activities of six essential oils: susceptibility of selected foodborne bacterial and fungal strains.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of essential oils (EOs) of cinnamon (Cinnamon zeylanicum), clove (Syzygium aromaticum), basil (Ocimum basillicum), rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis), dill (Anethum graveolens), and ginger (Zingiber officinalis) was evaluated over a range of concentrations in two types of contact tests (solid and vapor diffusion). The EOs were tested against an array of four Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Listeria monocytogenes), four Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Yersinia enterocolitica, Salmonella choleraesuis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa), and three fungi (a yeast, Candida albicans, and two molds, Penicillium islandicum and Aspergillus flavus). The rationale for this work was to test the possibility of creating a protective atmosphere by using natural compounds that could extend the shelf life of packaged foodstuffs while minimizing organoleptic alterations. In the solid diffusion tests, cinnamon and clove gave the strongest (and very similar) inhibition, followed by basil and rosemary, with dill and ginger giving the weakest inhibition. The fungi were the most sensitive microorganisms, followed by the Gram-positive bacterial strains. The Gram-negative strain P. aeruginosa was the least inhibited. The composition of the atmosphere generated by the EOs, and their minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs), were determined using a disk volatilization method, in which no inhibition from rosemary or basil was observed. Cinnamon and clove, once again, gave similar results for every microorganism. As a general rule, MIC (fungi) << MIC (bacteria) with no clear differences between Gram-positive or -negative strains except for P. aeruginosa, which was not inhibited by any of the EOs in the vapor phase. The atmosphere generated from the EOs was analyzed by means of solid-phase microextraction combined with gas chromatography-ion trap mass spectrometry. Differences among the volatiles in the EOs, which may be responsible for the differences in their antimicrobial performances, were found.
TI  - Cloning, production and functional expression of enterocin P, a sec-dependent bacteriocin produced by Enterococcus faecium P13, in Escherichia coli.
AB  - The cloning and expression of enterocin P (EntP), a sec-dependent bacteriocin produced by Enterococcus faecium P13, was studied in Escherichia coli. PCR-amplified products of the preenterocin P gene (entP) or entP plus the putative EntP immunity gene (entiP), were cloned in plasmid pETBlue-1 under the control of the inducible T7lac promoter. Although target genes in derivative plasmids pJG01 (entP) and pJG02 (entP plus entiP) did not generate products with antimicrobial activity after an in vitro combined transcription/translation reaction, they were expressed as biologically active products following transformation and induction in the E. coli Tuner(DE3)pLacI host. The use of specific antibodies and an ELISA permitted the detection and quantification of EntP in the supernatant (SN), cellular soluble protein fraction (CSF), and inclusion bodies (IB) of E. coli Tuner(DE3)pLacI cells transformed with either pJG01 or pJG02. Functional EntP from the supernatants of E. coli Tuner(DE3)pLacI (pJG01) cultures grown in a complex medium was recovered, at a high efficiency, by immunoaffinity chromatography in a single step. A purification method based on hydrophobic adsorption and reverse-phase chromatographies also permitted the recovery of active EntP from the supernatants of the same cultures grown in a minimally defined medium. The E. coli Tuner(DE3)pLacI (pJG01) cells would merit consideration as an alternative experimental model for the heterologous production and functional expression of EntP, as well as for the fast and efficient recovery of this bacteriocin from the supernatant of this recombinant producer.
TI  - Novel copper(II) homobinuclear macrocyclic complexes: cyclic voltammetry, biological properties and spectral studies.
AB  - A series of five new copper(II) macrocyclic complexes have been synthesized by template condensation. The bonding and stereochemistry of the complexes have been characterized by elemental analysis, molar conductance, magnetic susceptibility, IR, UV-visible, EPR spectral studies and electrochemical properties. g-Values are calculated for all of the complexes in polycrystalline form as well as in DMSO solution. The magnetic and spectral data indicate square planar geometry for all the complexes. Cyclic voltammograms for all the complexes are similar and involve two quasi-reversible redox processes. Cu(II)Cu(II)<=>Cu(II)Cu(I)<=>Cu(I)Cu(I). Their biological properties have also been studied. The macrocyclic complexes show more anti-bacterial than controlled one. The anti-bacterial activities of the compounds were tested against Streptococcus fecalis and Escherichia coli with different concentrations.
TI  - Domain 5 of high molecular weight kininogen is antibacterial.
AB  - Antimicrobial peptides are important effectors of the innate immune system. These peptides belong to a multifunctional group of molecules that apart from their antibacterial activities also interact with mammalian cells and glycosaminoglycans and control chemotaxis, apoptosis, and angiogenesis. Here we demonstrate a novel antimicrobial activity of the heparin-binding and cell-binding domain 5 of high molecular weight kininogen. Antimicrobial epitopes of domain 5 were characterized by analysis of overlapping peptides. A peptide, HKH20 (His(479)-His(498)), efficiently killed the Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the Gram-positive Enterococcus faecalis. Fluorescence microscopy and electron microscopy demonstrated that HKH20 binds to and induces breaks in bacterial membranes. Furthermore, no discernible hemolysis or membrane-permeabilizing effects on eukaryotic cells were noted. Proteolytic degradation of high molecular weight kininogen by neutrophil-derived proteases as well as the metalloproteinase elastase from P. aeruginosa yielded fragments comprising HKH20 epitopes, indicating that kininogen-derived antibacterial peptides are released during proteolysis.
TI  - Acquisition of resistant bowel flora during a double-blind randomized clinical trial of ertapenem versus piperacillin-tazobactam therapy for intraabdominal infections.
AB  - Bowel colonization with resistant bacteria can develop in patients receiving broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy. We compared the impact of two antimicrobial regimens often used to treat intraabdominal infections on susceptibility patterns of bowel flora at the end of therapy. In a double-blind clinical trial, adults with complicated intraabdominal infection requiring surgery were randomized to receive piperacillin-tazobactam (3.375 g every 6 h) or ertapenem (1 g once a day) for 4 to 14 days. Rectal swabs were obtained at baseline and at the end of study therapy to determine the acquisition rates of Enterobacteriaceae resistant to the study drug, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli or Klebsiella species, Pseudomonas aeruginosa resistant to imipenem or piperacillin-tazobactam, and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis or Enterococcus faecium. Treated patients were assessable for the acquisition of resistant bacteria if appropriate specimens were obtained at both time points. Enterobacteriaceae resistant to the treatment received were acquired during study therapy by 8/122 assessable piperacillin-tazobactam recipients (6.6%) compared to 0/122 assessable ertapenem recipients (P = 0.007). Neither ESBL-producing E. coli or Klebsiella species nor P. aeruginosa resistant to piperacillin-tazobactam was isolated from patients in either treatment group. Imipenem-resistant P. aeruginosa was acquired by two of the ertapenem recipients (1.6%) versus zero of the piperacillin-tazobactam recipients (P = 0.50). Vancomycin-resistant enterococci were acquired during therapy by 8/125 assessable ertapenem recipients (6.4%) versus 2/123 assessable piperacillin-tazobactam recipients (1.6%; P = 0.10). In this study, the acquisition of resistant Enterobacteriaceae occurred significantly more often in patients treated with piperacillin-tazobactam than in those treated with ertapenem.
TI  - Active membrane transport and receptor proteins from bacteria.
AB  - A general strategy for the expression of bacterial membrane transport and receptor genes in Escherichia coli is described. Expression is amplified so that the encoded proteins comprise 5-35% of E. coli inner membrane protein. Depending upon their topology, proteins are produced with RGSH6 or a Strep tag at the C-terminus. These enable purification in mg quantities for crystallization and NMR studies. Examples of one nutrient uptake and one multidrug extrusion protein from Helicobacter pylori are described. This strategy is successful for membrane proteins from H. pylori, E. coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Microbacterium liquefaciens, Brucella abortus, Brucella melitensis, Campylobacter jejuni, Neisseria meningitides, Streptomyces coelicolor and Rhodobacter sphaeroides.
TI  - Trypanosoma cruzi: influence of predominant bacteria from indigenous digestive microbiota on experimental infection in mice.
AB  - To verify the influence of some predominant components from indigenous microbiota on systemic immunological responses during experimental Chagas disease, germ-free NIH Swiss mice were mono-associated with Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacteroides vulgatus or Peptostreptococcus sp. and then infected with the Y strain of Trypanosoma cruzi. All the mono-associations predominantly induced a Th1 type of specific immune response to the infection by T. cruzi. A direct correlation was observed between a higher survival rate and increased IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha production (P<0.05) in E. faecalis-, B. vulgatus-, and Peptostreptococcus-associated mice. Moreover, higher levels of anti-T. cruzi IgG1 and anti-T. cruzi IgG2a were also found in mono-associated animals after infection. On the other hand, with the exception of E. faecalis-associated mice, mono-association induced a lower IL-10 production after infection (P<0.05) when compared with germ-free animals. Interestingly, spleen cell cultures from non-infected germ-free and mono-associated mice spontaneously produced higher levels (P<0.05) of IL-10 than cultures from infected mono-associated mice, except again for E. faecalis-associated animals. In conclusion, the presence of the components of the indigenous microbiota skews the immune response towards production of inflammatory cytokines during experimental infection with T. cruzi in gnotobiotic mice. However, the degree of increase in production of cytokines depends on each bacterial component.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of contemporary pathogens from uncomplicated urinary tract infections isolated in a multicenter Italian survey: possible impact on guidelines.
AB  - During 2004 four Italian Laboratories assessed the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance among uropathogens causing acute uncomplicated cystitis in female out-patients. A total of 600 urine samples from individuals aged 18-65 were studied. The overall prevalence of Escherichia coli was 85.3%. Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus faecalis and other rarer species were far less represented. Determination of the antibiotic susceptibility pattern of the entire collection of E. coli (512 organisms) revealed that among the drugs analyzed ampicillin was the least active molecule with only 62.5% of the strains being inhibited. Amoxicillin-clavulanate and cefuroxime displayed a higher potency (87.7% and 89.2% respectively). Cotrimoxazole inhibited only 70.1% of the uropathogens. The three fluoquinolones tested had comparable activity ranging from 83.0% for ciprofloxacin, to 83.6% for levofloxacin and 84.9% for prulifloxacin, indicating an identical spectrum of cross resistance. Nitrofurantoin (96.7%) and fosfomycin (98.6%) were the most potent drugs. Against the whole collection of uropathogens, only cefuroxime, nitrofurantoin and fosfomycin overcame the threshold of 90% activity, with the fluoroquinolones and amoxicillin-clavulanate suffering from about 15% resistance. The results of this survey strongly support the conclusions of recent Italian guidelines concerning the best empiric treatment of UTI in this country today.
TI  - Characterization of bacteriocins produced by lactic acid bacteria isolated from spoiled black olives.
AB  - Bacteriocin-producing strains of Lactobacillus plantarum ST23LD and ST341LD, Enterococcus faecium ST311LD and Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides ST33LD were isolated from the brine of spoiled black olives. The bacteriocins produced by all four strains inhibited the growth of Gram-positive bacteria (E. faecalis, L. casei and Streptococcus pneumoniae), but also Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Strain ST23LD produced two bacteriocins (ST23LDa and ST23LDb of approximately 3.0 and 14.0 kDa, respectively), with a combined maximum level of activity of 25,600 AU/ml after 18 h of growth. The same level of activity was recorded for bacteriocin ST341LD (approximately 3.0 kDa), but after 16 h. Bacteriocins ST311LD (ca. 2.3 kDa) and ST33LD (ca. 2.7 kDa) were produced at much lower levels (6400 AU/ml), and only after 20 h of growth. Bacteriocin activity was destroyed after treatment with proteolytic enzymes and Triton X, but not when treated with alpha-amylase, SDS, Tween 20, Tween 80, urea and EDTA, or when heated for 20 min at 121 degrees C. Addition of bacteriocins ST23LD, ST341LD and ST311LD to cells of Lactobacillus casei LHS in logarithmic phase resulted in growth inhibition for one hour, followed by a slight increase in optical density over the next seven hours. Bacteriocin ST33LD also inhibited the growth of strain LHS, but to a lesser extent. Bacteriocins ST23LD, ST341LD and ST33LD remained at the same level of activity for 6 h at pH<4.0. However, the activity of bacteriocin ST311LD decreased by 50% within 2 h at pH 4.4. The possibility of the bacteriocin adsorbing to the producer cell and proteolytic degradation is unlikely.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of Fill Canal, Sealapex, Mineral Trioxide Aggregate, Portland cement and EndoRez.
AB  - AIM: To determine in vitro the antimicrobial activity of Fill Canal, Sealapex, Mineral Trioxide Aggregate (MTA), Portland cement and EndoRez on various species of microorganisms. METHODOLOGY: The diffusion method on Muller-Hinton agar (MH) was employed. A base layer was made using MH agar and five wells were made by removing agar at equidistant points. Sealers were placed into the wells immediately after manipulation. The microorganisms Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Micrococcus luteus ATCC 9341, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 and Candida albicans ATCC 10231 were seeded by pour plate. The plates were kept at room temperature for 2 h for prediffusion and then incubated at 37 degrees C for 24 h. Aliquots of 10 mL of 0.05% triphenyltetrazolium chloride gel were added for optimization and the zones of inhibition were measured. RESULTS: Sealapex and Fill Canal demonstrated antimicrobial activity for all strains. For MTA and Portland cement, only E. coli was not inhibited. No antimicrobial activity was detected for EndoRez. CONCLUSIONS: In this laboratory study, Fill Canal, Sealapex, MTA and Portland cement presented antimicrobial activity whilst EndoRez did not.
TI  - Toll-like receptors-2, -3 and -4 expression patterns on human colon and their regulation by mucosal-associated bacteria.
AB  - The colonic epithelium provides an interface between the host and micro-organisms colonising the gastrointestinal tract. Molecular recognition of bacteria is facilitated through Toll-like receptors (TLR). The colonic epithelium expresses relatively high levels of mRNA for TLR3 and less for TLR2 and -4. Little is known of the expression patterns and mode of induction of expression for these pattern recognition receptors in human colon. The aim of this study was to investigate their localization in the gut and induction of expression in epithelial cell lines by mucosal bacteria. TLR2 and -4 were expressed only in crypt epithelial cells, expression was lost as the cells matured and moved towards the gut lumen. In contrast, TLR3 was only produced in mature epithelial cells. HT29 and CACO-2 had different levels of expression for TLR1-4. Co-culture of HT29 cells with different mucosal isolates showed that they were highly responsive to bacterial challenge, with up-regulation of mRNA for TLR1-4. In contrast, CACO-2 cells were refractive to bacterial challenge, showing little difference in mRNA levels. TLR3 was induced in HT29 only by Gram-positive commensals with up-regulation of both mRNA and protein and an enhancement of the antiviral immune response. This pattern of expression allows induction of responsiveness to bacteria only by the crypt epithelium so that tolerance to commensal organisms can be maintained. In contrast, mature columnar epithelium is able to respond to viral pathogens, which are not part of the normal gut commensal microbiota.
TI  - Combined effect of high-pressure treatments and bacteriocin-producing lactic acid bacteria on inactivation of Escherichia coli O157:H7 in raw-milk cheese.
AB  - The effect of high-pressure (HP) treatments combined with bacteriocins of lactic  acid bacteria (LAB) produced in situ on the survival of Escherichia coli O157:H7 in cheese was investigated. Cheeses were manufactured from raw milk inoculated with E. coli O157:H7 at approximately 10(5) CFU/ml. Seven different bacteriocin-producing LAB were added at approximately 10(6) CFU/ml as adjuncts to the starter. Cheeses were pressurized on day 2 or 50 at 300 MPa for 10 min or 500 MPa for 5 min, at 10 degrees C in both cases. After 60 days, E. coli O157:H7 counts in cheeses manufactured without bacteriocin-producing LAB and not pressurized were 5.1 log CFU/g. A higher inactivation of E. coli O157:H7 was achieved in cheeses without bacteriocin-producing LAB when 300 MPa was applied on day 50 (3.8-log-unit reduction) than if applied on day 2 (1.3-log-unit reduction). Application of 500 MPa eliminated E. coli O157:H7 in 60-day-old cheeses. Cheeses made with bacteriocin-producing LAB and not pressurized showed a slight reduction of the pathogen. Pressurization at 300 MPa on day 2 and addition of lacticin 481-, nisin A-, bacteriocin TAB 57-, or enterocin AS-48-producing LAB were synergistic and reduced E. coli O157:H7 counts to levels below 2 log units in 60-day-old cheeses. Pressurization at 300 MPa on day 50 and addition of nisin A-, bacteriocin TAB 57-, enterocin I-, or enterocin AS-48-producing LAB completely inactivated E. coli O157:H7 in 60-day-old cheeses. The application of reduced pressures combined with bacteriocin-producing LAB is a feasible procedure to improve cheese safety.
TI  - Aetiology of catheter-associated bacteriuria in Lagos University Teaching Hospital.
AB  - A prospective study to determine the causative agents of catheter-related bacteriuria was carried out on 99 patients with median age of 55 years, on admission in the Oncology, Paediatric Surgery and Obstetric and Gynaecology wards of the Lagos University Teaching Hospital. There was significant bacteriuria in seventy-one (72%) of the 99 urine samples. All catheter urine samples were contaminated by day 5 Gram-negative bacilli were predominant (89.3%) of which Pseudomonas aeruginosa (26.2%) was the most common, while Escherichia coli and Enterobacter aerogenes accounted for 15.5% each, closely followed by Proteus mirabilis (14.3%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (9.5%). The Gram positive isolates Enterococcus faecalis (8.3%) and Staphylococcus saprophyticus (2.4%) made up only 10.7% of isolates. Most of the isolates from catheterised patients were resistant to the common antibiotics such as ampicillin, cotrimoxazole, gentamicin and ceftriaxone with high susceptibility to ofloxacin and ceftazidime though the isolates of Enterococcus faecalis was also resistant to ofloxacin. However, isolates of S. saprophyticus were still susceptible to the penicillins and tetracycline.
TI  - Identification of essential genes in Streptococcus pneumoniae by allelic replacement mutagenesis.
AB  - To find potential targets of novel antimicrobial agents, we identified essential  genes of Streptococcus pneumoniae using comparative genomics and allelic replacement mutagenesis. We compared the genome of S. pneumoniae R6 with those of Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus, and selected 693 candidate target genes with > 40% amino acid sequence identity to the corresponding genes in at least two of the other species. The 693 genes were disrupted and 133 were found to be essential for growth. Of these, 32 encoded proteins of unknown function, and we were able to identify orthologues of 22 of these genes by genomic comparisons. The experimental method used in this study is easy to perform, rapid and efficient for identifying essential genes of bacterial pathogens.
TI  - Acridine orange leukocyte cytospin test for central venous catheter--related bloodstream infection: a pediatric experience.
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the acridine orange leukocyte cytospin (AOLC) test for the rapid diagnosis of septicemia caused by central venous catheters (CVCs), without removing the catheter, in a pediatric intensive care unit population. Twenty-six patients admitted in the pediatric intensive care unit of Azienda Ospedaliera "Ospedali Riuniti di Bergamo", Italy, were prospectively evaluated for CVC-related infection. Blood for culture was taken from all patients. Quantitative endoluminal cultures of the removed catheter tip by Cleri's technique and semiquantitative superficial cultures of the hub were performed. Gram staining and an AOLC smear were done according to Kite's technique. Four Staphylococcus CVC-related bloodstream infections were identified. CVC colonization was detected in 8 patients. Four had septicemia (Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Candida glabrata) without CVC involvement. However, Gram staining and the AOLC test were negative in all cases. We conclude that cytocentrifugation and acridine orange staining of blood withdrawn by Kite's method from an in situ catheter, although simple, quick, and inexpensive, did not aid diagnosis in this pediatric population.
TI  - Sensitivity to detergents and plasmid curing in Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - This research reports the sensitivity of a clinical isolate of Enterococcus faecalis to sodium N-lauroylsarcosinate (sarkosyl) and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), as well as the efficiency of these detergents in curing the strain. Compared to Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis was very sensitive to both detergents, with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) for the latter being 100 times lower than for Escherichia coli. The clinical isolate of Enterococcus faecalis used in this study exhibited plasmid-borne resistance to kanamycin (MIC 2 mg/ml) and tetracycline (MIC 50 mug/ml); 3% curing was observed after growth in the presence of sarkosyl but no curing was observed after growth in the presence of either SDS or acridine orange. In contrast, 35% curing of plasmid-bearing Escherichia coli was observed after growth in the presence of either SDS or acridine orange, but none was observed after growth in the presence of sarkosyl.
TI  - Antibacterial properties of some cyclic organobismuth(III) compounds.
AB  - Bismuth compounds are known for their low levels of toxicity in mammals, and various types of bismuth salts have been used to treat medical disorders. As part of our program to probe this aspect of bismuth chemistry, cyclic organobismuth compounds 1 to 8 bearing a nitrogen or sulfur atom as an additional ring member have been synthesized, and their antimicrobial activities against five standard strains of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria were assessed. The eight-membered-ring compounds, compounds 1 to 3, exhibited MICs of less than 0.5 microg/ml against Staphylococcus aureus and were more active than the six-membered ones, compounds 5 to 8 (MICs, 4.0 to 16 microg/ml). The gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, and Enterococcus faecalis) were more susceptible to both types of ring compounds than the gram-negative ones (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Treatment with polymyxin B nonapeptide increased the susceptibility of E. coli to cyclic organobismuth compounds, indicating the low permeability of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria to the compounds. Compound 1 also had activity against methicillin-resistant S. aureus, which had an MIC for 90% of the hospital stock strains of 1.25 microg/ml. The killing curves for S. aureus treated with compound 1 or 3 revealed a static effect at a low dose (2x the MIC). However, when S. aureus was treated with 10x the MIC of compound 1 or 3, there was an approximately 3-log reduction in the viable cell number after 48 h of treatment. Electron microscopic inspection demonstrated a considerable increase in the size of S. aureus and the proportion of cells undergoing cell division after treatment with compound 1 at 0.5x the MIC.
TI  - Domain swapping between Enterococcus faecalis FabN and FabZ proteins localizes the structural determinants for isomerase activity.
AB  - Anaerobic unsaturated fatty acid synthesis in bacteria occurs through the introduction of a double bond into the growing acyl chain. In the Escherichia coli model system, FabA catalyzes both the dehydration of beta-hydroxydecanoyl-ACP and the isomerization of trans-2-decenoyl-ACP to cis-3-decenoyl-ACP as the essential step. A second dehydratase, FabZ, functions in acyl chain elongation but cannot carry out the isomerization reaction. Enterococcus faecalis has two highly related FabZ homologs. One of these, termed EfFabN, carries out the isomerization reaction in vivo, whereas the other, EfFabZ, does not (Wang, H., and Cronan, J. E. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 34489-34495). We carried out a series of domain swapping and mutagenesis experiments coupled with in vitro biochemical analyses to define the structural feature(s) that specify the catalytic properties of these two enzymes. Substitution of the beta3 and beta4 strands of EfFabZ with the corresponding strands from EfFabN was necessary and sufficient to convert EfFabZ into an isomerase. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that the isomerase potential of beta-hydroxyacyl-ACP dehydratases is determined by the properties of the beta-sheets that dictate the orientation of the central alpha-helix and thus the shape of the substrate binding tunnel rather than the catalytic machinery at the active site.
TI  - Structure--antimicrobial activity of some natural isocoumarins and their analogues.
AB  - Three naturally occurring isocoumarins (paepalantine, paepalantine 9-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside and paepalantine 9-O-beta-D-allopyranosyl(1 --> 6) glucopyranoside) and two semi-synthetic analogues, 9,10-acylated compound and 9-OH-10-methylated compound, structurally similar to paepalantine, were evaluated for antimicrobial activity using a spectrophotometric microdilution technique. The paepalantine was active against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, and E. faecalis while the other four compounds proved ineffective against all microorganisms tested at concentrations of 500 microg/ml. Variations in phenolic substitution at OH-9 and/or OH-10 in the paepalantine molecule resulted in compounds without antimicrobial activity. A combination of structural features, two phenolic groups as cathecolic system, forms an oxygenated system arrangement that may reflect the potentially antimicrobial properties of paepalantine.
TI  - [Resistance of urinary tract infection pathogens and choice of antibacterial therapy in pediatric urologic practice].
AB  - The data on antibiotic resistance of the main uropathogens isolated from patients with urinary tract infection in an urologic department (319 isolates) and outpatient and diagnostic units (360 isolates) are presented. It was shown that by the antibiotic resistance the Escherichia coli isolates from the urologic department patients and outpatients did not practically differ: 44.1 and 47.8% of the isolates were resistant to ampicillin, 26.7 and 23.4% were resistant to amoxycillin/clavulanate, 28.9 and 24.9% were resistant to co-trimoxazole and 26.5% was resistance to cefuroxime (outpatients). The basic differences referred to Pseudomonas aeruginosa: resistance to ceftazidime in 38.5% of the isolates and resistance to gentamicin in 36.2% of the isolates. The activity against P. aeruginosa could be arranged as follows in the decreasing order: amikacin = meropenem > imipenem > cefepime = cefoperazone/sulbactam > gentamicin = ceftazidime. Resistance of P. aeruginosa to fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin) remained low (7.4 and 8.0% respectively). No ampicillin resistance was revealed in the isolates of Enterococcus faecalis.
TI  - Bacterial contamination of test stimulation leads during percutaneous nerve stimulation.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To analyze the bacterial contamination of conventional percutaneous nerve stimulation (PNE) leads. Sacral neuromodulation has become an important tool for the treatment of urgency and chronic retention. Patients likely to benefit from this type of therapy are identified by PNE testing before implantation of the definitive system. Recently, a new system was introduced, using a self-blocking electrode that remains in place for both PNE testing and final implantation. PNE testing warrants an extracorporeal stimulator. Thus, using the same electrode for both external stimulation and definitive implantation may carry a significant risk of infection. METHODS: Bilateral PNE testing was performed in 11 consecutive patients (8 women and 3 men, mean age 41.6 years) for either urgency (n = 7) or chronic retention (n = 4). Electrodes were placed under aseptic conditions and stimulated for 3 days. At the end of each test, the electrodes were removed and evaluated microbiologically. RESULTS: In 5 of the 11 patients (9 of 22 leads), significant bacterial growth was detected: Staphylococcus epidermidis in 5, Escherichia coli in 3, and Enterococcus faecalis in 1. However, no patient showed signs of inflammation at the electrode insertion sites. CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial growth was found in 45.5% of the patients after conventional PNE testing under aseptic conditions. Therefore, the new electrodes may well carry an elevated risk of infection. Infection of the implant can lead to major surgical revision or even explantation. Thus, additional studies of the infection risk of this new electrode are warranted before its general use can be recommended.

TI  - Enterococcus faecalis sex pheromone plasmid pAM373: analyses of TraA and evidence for its interaction with RpoB.
AB  - The Enterococcus faecalis plasmid pAM373 (36.7kb) encodes a mating response to the sex pheromone cAM373 secreted by recipient (plasmid-free) bacteria. Like certain other conjugative enterococcal plasmids, a key regulator of the pheromone response is a negatively acting protein, TraA, which is believed to interact with internalized pheromone to influence expression from a key transcriptional promoter P(0). An earlier report showed that in the case of pAM373 most, but not all, transposon-insertion mutations in traA differed from those in the case of pAD1 and pCF10 in that they did not give rise to the normally characteristic constitutive clumping. We show here that this phenomenon relates to a host effect involving an RpoB-related mutation associated with rifampin resistance. When harboring traA mutants, rifampin-sensitive hosts exhibited constitutive clumping, whereas rifampin-resistant hosts did not-despite the fact that the latter host exhibited a normal pheromone-inducible clumping response when harboring a wild-type plasmid. The data imply that TraA normally remains associated with the transcription complex after induction. In addition the promoter of traA, designated P(a), was shown to be located about 600bp upstream of the translational start site, as clones containing traA required this site to complement traA mutants in trans. Transcription from P(a) also gave rise to a short (130 nt) transcript, mD, expressed at a high level in uninduced cells. An earlier observation suggesting that TraA negatively affected transcriptional readthrough into the 3' end of traA from the t(ac) intrinsic bidirectional terminator between traA and the opposing, adjacent traC was supported by TraA complementation studies. Evidence is also presented suggesting that this regulation at t(ac) also involves an additional, possibly cis-acting, element.
TI  - Benzimidazolyl quinolinyl mercaptotriazoles as potential antimicrobial and antiviral agents.
AB  - Condensation of ethylaceto acetate (EAA) with resorcinol in concentrated H2SO4 afforded 7-hydroxy-4-methyl coumarin (1), which on reaction with thiosemicarbazide in anhydrous pyridine yielded 7-hydroxy-4-methyl-quinolinyl [1,5-c]-mercaptotriazole (2). Reaction of 2 with formaldehyde solution and amino acid in ethanol yielded 7-hydroxy-4-methyl-8-(N-methyl-aminoacid)-quinolinyl [1,5-c]-2''-mercaptotriazole (3a-e). Interaction of 3 with o-phenylenediamine in pyridine yielded 7-hydroxy-4-methyl-8-(aminobenzimidazolyl)-quinolinyl [1,5-c]-2''-mercaptotriazole derivatives (4a-e). The latter compounds were evaluated for their antiviral and antimicrobial activities.
TI  - Chemical compositions and antimicrobial activities of four different Anatolian propolis samples.
AB  - Propolis means a gum that is gathered by bees from various plants. It is known for its biological properties, having antibacterial, antifungal and healing properties. The aims of this study were to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of four different Anatolian propolis samples on different groups of microorganisms including some oral pathogens and comparison between their chemical compositions. Ethanol extracts of propolis (EEP) were prepared from four different Anatolian propolis samples and examined whether EEP inhibit the growth of the test microorganisms or not. For the antimicrobial activity assays, minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were determined by using macrodilution method. The MIC values of the most effective propolis (TB) were 2 microg/ml for Streptococcus sobrinus and Enterococcus faecalis, 4 microg/ml for Micrococcus luteus, Candida albicans and C. krusei, 8 microg/ml for Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterobacter aerogenes, 16 microg/ml for Escherichia coli and C. tropicalis and 32 microg/ml for Salmonella typhimurium and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The chemical compositions of EEP's were determined by high-temperature high-resolution gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. The main compounds of four Anatolian propolis samples were flavonoids such as pinocembrin, pinostropin, isalpinin, pinobanksin, quercetin, naringenin, galangine and chrysin. Although propolis samples were collected from different regions of Anatolia all showed significant antimicrobial activity against the Gram positive bacteria and yeasts. Propolis can prevent dental caries since it demonstrated significant antimicrobial activity against the microorganisms such as Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus and C. albicans, which involves in oral diseases.
TI  - Antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral activities of the lipophylic extracts of Pistacia vera.
AB  - In the present study, antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral properties of 15 lipohylic extracts obtained from different parts (leaf, branch, stem, kernel, shell skins, seeds) of Pistacia vera were screened against both standard and the isolated strains of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans and C. parapsilosis by microdilution method. Both Herpes simplex (DNA) and Parainfluenza viruses (RNA) were used for the determination of antiviral activity of the P. vera extracts by using Vero cell line. Ampicilline, ofloxocine, ketoconazole, fluconazole, acyclovir and oseltamivir were used as the control agents. The extracts showed little antibacterial activity between the range of 128-256 microg/ml concentrations whereas they had noticeable antifungal activity at the same concentrations. Kernel and seed extracts showed significant antiviral activity compared to the rest of the extracts as well as the controls.
TI  - Inactivation of enteric microorganisms with chemical disinfectants, UV irradiation and combined chemical/UV treatments.
AB  - The relative disinfection efficiencies of peracetic acid (PAA), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) against Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Salmonella enteritidis and coliphage MS2 virus were studied in laboratory-scale experiments. This study also evaluated the efficiency of combined PAA/ultraviolet irradiation (UV) and H2O2/UV treatments to determine if the microbial inactivation was synergistic. Microbial cultures were added into a synthetic wastewater-like test medium and treated by chemical disinfectants with a 10 min contact time, UV irradiation or the combination of chemical and UV treatments. A peracetic acid dose of 3 mg/l resulted in approximately 2-3 log enteric bacterial reductions, whereas 7-15 mg/l PAA was needed to achieve 1-1.5 log coliphage MS2 reductions. Doses of 3-150 mg/l hydrogen peroxide achieved below 0.2 log microbial reductions. Sodium hypochlorite treatments caused 0.3-1 log microbial reductions at an 18 mg/l chlorine dose, while 2.6 log reductions of E. faecalis were achieved at a 12 mg/l chlorine dose. The results indicate that PAA could represent a good alternative to chlorine compounds in disinfection procedures, especially in wastewaters containing easily oxidizable organic matter. Hydrogen peroxide is not an efficient disinfectant against enteric microorganisms in wastewaters. The combined PAA/UV disinfection showed increased disinfection efficiency and synergistic benefits with all the enteric bacteria tested but lower synergies for the coliphage MS2. This suggests that this method could improve the efficiency and reliability of disinfection in wastewater treatment plants. The combined H2O2/UV disinfection only slightly influenced the microbial reductions compared to UV treatments and showed some antagonism and no synergies.
TI  - Enterococcus faecalis divIVA: an essential gene involved in cell division, cell growth and chromosome segregation.
AB  - Enterococcus faecalis divIVA (divIVAEf) is an essential gene implicated in cell division and chromosome segregation. This gene was disrupted by insertional inactivation creating E. faecalis JHSR1, which was viable only when a wild-type copy of divIVAEf was expressed in trans, confirming the essentiality of the gene. The absence of DivIVAEf in E. faecalis JHSR1 inhibited proper cell division, which resulted in abnormal cell clusters possessing enlarged cells of altered shape instead of the characteristic diplococcal morphology of enterococci. The lower viability of the divIVAEf mutant is caused by improper nucleoid segregation and impaired septation within the numerous cells generated in each cluster. Overexpression of DivIVAEf in Escherichia coli KJB24 resulted in enlarged cells with disrupted cell division, suggesting that this round E. coli mutant strain could be used as an indicator for functionality of DivIVAEf. A Bacillus subtilis divIVA mutant was not complemented by DivIVAEf, indicating that this protein does not recognize DivIVA-specific target sites in B. subtilis, or that it does not interact with other proteins of the cell division machinery of this micro-organism. DivIVAEf also failed to complement a Streptococcus pneumoniae divIVA mutant, supporting the phylogenetic distance between Enterococcus and Streptococcus. Our results indicate that DivIVA is a species-specific multifunctional protein implicated in cell division and chromosome segregation in E. faecalis.
TI  - Antibacterial screening of anthocyanic and proanthocyanic fractions from cranberry juice.
AB  - The effect of anthocyanin- and proanthocyanidin-rich fractions isolated from cranberry juice was studied for their antibacterial activity against nine bacterial strains. Activity was assessed by the agar diffusion assay. Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538 was the only strain to exhibit some susceptibility to four out of 10 anthocyanin-rich fractions tested. A variable susceptibility of S. aureus, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 10541, and Micrococcus luteus ATCC 9341 to proanthocyanidin- rich fractions was also observed. Streptococcus mutans strains as well as Escherichia coli ATCC 10538 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 were not susceptible to any of the cranberry juice samples or fractions at the tested concentrations. There was no clear correlation between Gram-positive or Gram-negative bacterial susceptibility to cranberry juice. In this work, the role of cranberry juice anthocyanic and proanthocyanic fractions upon bacterial viability is discussed.
TI  - The expression of alpha4 integrins by human polymorphonuclear neutrophils in response to sonicated extracts of Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - This study was undertaken to investigate immunopathologic mechanism of Enterococcus faecalis in relation to persistent apical periodontitis. We monitored the expression levels of alpha4 integrin in human polymorphonuclear neutophils (PMNs) after stimulated with sonicated extracts of E. faecalis (SEF) and compared with lipopolycaccarides (LPS) of Escherichia coli for various incubation time. Venous blood was collected from healthy volunteers and then PMNs were isolated and cultured with various concentrations of SEF for different periods of time. The levels of alpha4 integrin were measured by flow cytometry analysis. E. coli LPS group was used as a positive control and untreated PMNs as a negative control. Results showed that the expressions levels of alpha4 integrin were increased in human PMNs stimulated with E. coli LPS in comparison with unstimulated control cells (p < 0.05). In case of SEF stimulated group, the expression levels were decreased in time-dependent manner in comparison to E. coli LPS group (p < 0.05). Notably, after 12 h for incubation with SEF, the expression of alpha4 integrin was decreased in dose-dependent manner (p < 0.05). These findings suggest that E. faecalis seem to suppress PMNs recruiting activity by down-regulating alpha4 integrin expression, providing the possible mechanism that E. faecalis may play a crucial role in persistent apical periodontitis.
TI  - Structural modifications and antimicrobial activity of N-cycloalkenyl-2-acylalkylidene-2,3-dihydro-1,3-benzothiazoles.
AB  - A series of N-cycloalkenyl-2-acylalkylidene-2,3-dihydro-1,3-benzothiazoles 5a-j,  N-cycloalkyl-2-acylalkylidene-2,3-dihydro-1,3-benzothiazoles 8a-e, and N-alkyl-2-acylalkylidene-2,3-dihydro-1,3-benzothiazoles 8f-h, were synthesized and tested for in vitro antibacterial and antifungal activities against four gram-positive and five gram-negative bacteria (Bacillus subtilis 6633, Enterococcus faecalis 29212, Staphylococcus aureus 6538, Staphylococcus aureus 25923, Escherichia coli 25922, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus a1, A. calcoaceticus a2, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 27835, Klebsiella oxytoca 49131), four yeast-like fungi and one fungus (Candida tropicalis 750, C. albicans 14053, C. albicans 10231, Cryptococcus laurentii 18803, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae). Microdilution broth and agar dilution methods were used for antimicrobial tests. The findings obtained showed that some of the tested compounds 5 and 8 were effective against some of the bacterial strains used, whereas, only compounds 8b-g exhibited a moderate antifungal activity against the yeast strains evaluated.
TI  - Variable phenotypes of enterocolitis in interleukin 10-deficient mice monoassociated with two different commensal bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: To explore the hypothesis that selective immune responses to distinct components of the intestinal microflora induce intestinal inflammation, we characterized disease kinetics and bacterial antigen-specific T-cell responses in ex germ-free interleukin 10 -/- and wild-type control mice monoassociated with Enterococcus faecalis , Escherichia coli , or Pseudomonas fluorescens . METHODS: Colitis was measured by using blinded histological scores and spontaneous interleukin 12 secretion from colonic strip culture supernatants. Interferon gamma secretion was measured from mesenteric or caudal lymph node CD4 + T cells stimulated with bacterial lysate-pulsed antigen-presenting cells. Luminal bacterial concentrations were measured by culture and quantitative polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Escherichia coli induced mild cecal inflammation after 3 weeks of monoassociation in interleukin 10 -/- mice. In contrast, Enterococcus faecalis-monoassociated interleukin 10 -/- mice developed distal colitis at 10-12 weeks that was progressively more severe and associated with duodenal inflammation and obstruction by 30 weeks. Neither bacterial strain induced inflammation in wild-type mice, and germ-free and Pseudomonas fluorescens-monoassociated interleukin 10 -/- mice remained disease free. CD4 + T cells from Enterococcus faecalis- or Escherichia coli-monoassociated interleukin 10 -/- mice selectively produced higher levels of interferon gamma and interleukin 4 when stimulated with antigen-presenting cells pulsed with the bacterial species that induced disease; these immune responses preceded the onset of histological inflammation in Enterococcus faecalis -monoassociated mice. Luminal bacterial concentrations did not explain regional differences in inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: Different commensal bacterial species selectively initiate immune-mediated intestinal inflammation with distinctly different kinetics and anatomic distribution in the same host.
TI  - A restraint molecular dynamics and simulated annealing approach for protein homology modeling utilizing mean angles.
AB  - BACKGROUND: We have developed the program PERMOL for semi-automated homology modeling of proteins. It is based on restrained molecular dynamics using a simulated annealing protocol in torsion angle space. As main restraints defining the optimal local geometry of the structure weighted mean dihedral angles and their standard deviations are used which are calculated with an algorithm described earlier by Doker et al. (1999, BBRC, 257, 348-350). The overall long-range contacts are established via a small number of distance restraints between atoms involved in hydrogen bonds and backbone atoms of conserved residues. Employing the restraints generated by PERMOL three-dimensional structures are obtained using standard molecular dynamics programs such as DYANA or CNS. RESULTS: To test this modeling approach it has been used for predicting the structure of the histidine-containing phosphocarrier protein HPr from E. coli and the structure of the human peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (Ppar gamma). The divergence between the modeled HPr and the previously determined X-ray structure was comparable to the divergence between the X-ray structure and the published NMR structure. The modeled structure of Ppar gamma was also very close to the previously solved X-ray structure with an RMSD of 0.262 nm for the backbone atoms. CONCLUSION: In summary, we present a new method for homology modeling capable of producing high-quality structure models. An advantage of the method is that it can be used in combination with incomplete NMR data to obtain reasonable structure models in accordance with the experimental data.
TI  - Neonatal adrenal abscess revisited: the importance of raised inflammatory markers.
AB  - Adrenal abscesses rarely occur in neonates and usually present with non-specific  signs and symptoms. Prompt diagnosis requires an index of suspicion. We describe right-sided adrenal haemorrhage and abscess formation in a newborn with hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy following maternal post-partum haemorrhage and sepsis with Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis. Percutaneous drainage of the abscess identified an E. coli isolate identical to that in the mother plus Candida albicans.
TI  - Enterococcus faecalis phosphomevalonate kinase.
AB  - The six enzymes of the mevalonate pathway of isopentenyl diphosphate biosynthesis represent potential for addressing a pressing human health concern, the development of antibiotics against resistant strains of the Gram-positive streptococci. We previously characterized the first four of the mevalonate pathway enzymes of Enterococcus faecalis, and here characterize the fifth, phosphomevalonate kinase (E.C. 2.7.4.2). E. faecalis genomic DNA and the polymerase chain reaction were used to clone DNA thought to encode phosphomevalonate kinase into pET28b(+). Double-stranded DNA sequencing verified the sequence of the recombinant gene. The encoded N-terminal hexahistidine-tagged protein was expressed in Escherichia coli with induction by isopropylthiogalactoside and purified by Ni(++) affinity chromatography, yield 20 mg protein per liter. Analysis of the purified protein by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry established it as E. faecalis phosphomevalonate kinase. Analytical ultracentrifugation revealed that the kinase exists in solution primarily as a dimer. Assay for phosphomevalonate kinase activity used pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase to couple the formation of ADP to the oxidation of NADH. Optimal activity occurred at pH 8.0 and at 37 degrees C. The activation energy was approximately 5.6 kcal/mol. Activity with Mn(++), the preferred cation, was optimal at about 4 mM. Relative rates using different phosphoryl donors were 100 (ATP), 3.6 (GTP), 1.6 (TTP), and 0.4 (CTP). K(m) values were 0.17 mM for ATP and 0.19 mM for (R,S)-5-phosphomevalonate. The specific activity of the purified enzyme was 3.9 micromol substrate converted per minute per milligram protein. Applications to an immobilized enzyme bioreactor and to drug screening and design are discussed.
TI  - Analysis of etiology and drug resistance of biliary infections.
AB  - The bile was collected from fro patients with biliary infections, with the bacterium isolated to study the sensitivity of each kind of the bacterium to several antibiotics in common use. Except G- bacterium, we also found some kinds of G+ bacterium in infection bile. G- bacterium were not sensitive to Clindamycin, G+ bacterium were sensitive to Ciprofloxacin. Escherichia coli, Xanthomonas maltophilia, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa were sensitive to Ampicillin. G+ bacterium were not sensitive to Azactam. Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterobacter cloacae were not sensitive to Ceftazidime. Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus coagulase negative, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa were not sensitive to Ceftriaxone Sodium. We didn't found any bacterium resistance Imipenem. The possibility of the existence of G+ bacterium as well as drug resistance should be considered n patients with biliary infections. The value of susceptibility test should be respected to avoid drug abuse of antibiotics.
TI  - Enterococcus faecalis tropism for the kidneys in the urinary tract of C57BL/6J mice.
AB  - Enterococcus faecalis is a gram-positive bacterium that can cause a variety of nosocomial infections of which urinary tract infections are the most common. These infections can be exceptionally difficult to treat because of drug resistance of many E. faecalis isolates. Despite their troublesome nature, little is known about the host or bacterial factors necessary for E. faecalis to cause disease in the urinary tract. Using a mouse model of urinary tract infection, we have shown that E. faecalis is capable of persisting in the kidneys of mice for at least 2 weeks. In contrast, bacterial titers from the bladders of the same mice were inconsistent and tended to be much lower than those recovered from the kidney. This preference for the kidney over the bladder is also observed in other clinical E. faecalis strains. Histologic examination of bladder and kidney tissues demonstrated that E. faecalis induced an inflammatory response in the kidney but not in the bladder. This inflammatory response was TLR2 independent and did not induce inflammatory markers typically associated with uropathogenic Escherichia coli. Using a competition assay, we demonstrated that a pyelonephritis clinical isolate had a growth advantage over a laboratory strain of E. faecalis in the kidneys but not in the bladders of mice. Taken together, these results demonstrate that E. faecalis has tropism for the kidneys in the urinary tracts of mice and that this system can be used to study factors involved in the pathogenesis of urinary tract infections.
TI  - [Antimicrobial action of Lentinus edodes juice on human microflora].
AB  - The action of the juice of Shiitake mushroom (L. edodes) on pathogenic and opportunistic microorganisms, detected in cases of considerable dysbiotic changes (Escherichia coli O-114, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Candida albicans), as well as on some bacterial eubiotic producer strains (Escherichia coli M-17, Bifidobacterium spp., Lactobacillus spp.). The juice of this mushroom at a concentration of 5% from the volume of the nutrient medium was found to produce a pronounced antimicrobial effect with respect to C. albicans, S. aureus, E. faecalis, E. coli O-114 and to stimulate the growth of E. coli M-17. Bifidobacteria and lactobacteria exhibited resistance to the action of L. edodes juice.
TI  - (1)H NMR spectroscopy in the diagnosis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa-induced urinary  tract infection.
AB  - The utility of (1)H NMR spectroscopy is suggested and demonstrated for the diagnosis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in urinary tract infection (UTI). The specific property of P. aeruginosa of metabolizing nicotinic acid to 6-hydroxynicotinic acid (6-OHNA) is exploited. The quantity of 6-OHNA produced correlates well with the viable bacterial count. Other common bacteria causing UTI such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Enterobacter aerogenes, Acinetobacter baumanii, Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter frundii, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus gp B and Staphylococcus aureus do not metabolize nicotinic acid under similar conditions. The method provides a single-step documentation of P. aeruginosa qualitatively as well as quantitatively. The NMR method is demonstrated on urine samples from 30 patients with UTI caused by P. aeruginosa.
TI  - [Urinary tract infection caused by bacteria of the genus Aeromonas].
AB  
TI  - Molecular vs culture methods for the detection of bacterial faecal indicators in  groundwater for human use.
AB  - AIMS: The current standard culture methods are unable to detect nongrowing bacteria and, thus, might not be sufficient for precise monitoring of the microbiological quality of waters. The use of a molecular method such as PCR could be a valid alternative to detect bacterial faecal contamination indicators such as Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis and reveal the presence of culturable and nonculturable bacterial forms. METHODS AND RESULTS: The presence of E. coli and Ent. faecalis cells in 30 groundwater samples was evaluated with the standard culture method and compared with a specific PCR protocol. A substantial percentage (50%) of the samples not containing culturable cells proved positive in the search for Ent. faecalis DNA by PCR. Quantification by competitive PCR (cPCR) of the DNA detected allowed us to calculate the number of nonculturable cells present in water samples: the number varied from 2 to 120 cells ml(-1). Only four samples were positive for E. coli DNA and the corresponding nonculturable cells varied from 24 to 70 ml(-1). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that the standard culture methods in use are unable to detect a substantial proportion of the bacterial population which is nonculturable but, as previously demonstrated, potentially still viable and able to express those pathogenic factors needed for causing infections in humans. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: To protect human health it is necessary to develop and use methods which detect the nonculturable as well as culturable bacteria present in water.
TI  - Survey of the susceptibility of urinary isolates to antibacterial agents in 2003.
AB  - In 2003, 826 uropathogenic strains were obtained from the urine of our patients.  We assessed their activities to antibacterial agents based on the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) breakpoints recommended by the National Committee for Clinical Standards (NCCLS). Methicillin-resistant strains accounted for about 70% of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. The most common gram-positive species was Enterococcus faecalis (15.6%). Enterococcus faecium was the most resistant of the enterococcal species, and the rate of susceptibility to beta-lactams (BLs), fluoroquinolones (FQs), and tetracyclines (TCs) was 0%, 6%, and less than 18%, respectively. Escherichia coli accounted for over 50% of the gram-negative bacilli. The proportion of FQ-resistant or intermediate strains was over 20%, and four of these strains (1.1%) were suspected of producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL). All the ESBL-producing strains (ESBLs) possess resistance to FQs. Over 95% of Klebsiella pneumoniae was susceptible to all agents. The distribution of antimicrobial activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa indicated a decrease in the number of multidrug-resistant strains and an increase in strains susceptible to all agents. Some differences existed in the resistance to antibacterial agents among Proteus species. No ESBL-producing or multidrug-resistant strain was isolated from Serratia marcescens. This survey suggests that serious clinical problems will result from the increasing number of enterococcal species with multidrug resistance in gram-positive cocci, and isolates of ESBL-producing or FQs-resistant strains in gram-negative bacilli.
TI  - Effect of the growth promoter avilamycin on emergence and persistence of antimicrobial resistance in enteric bacteria in the pig.
AB  - AIM: To assess the effect of the growth promoter avilamycin on emergence and persistence of resistance in enteric bacteria in the pig. METHODS AND RESULTS: Pigs (treated with avilamycin for 3 months and controls) were challenged with multi-resistant Salmonella Typhimurium DT104 and faecal counts were performed for enterococci, Escherichia coli, S. Typhimurium and Campylobacter (before, during and 5 weeks post-treatment). Representative isolates were tested for antibiotic resistance and for the presence of resistance genes. Avilamycin-resistant Enterococci faecalis (speciated by PCR) were isolated from the treated pigs and continued to be detected for the first week after treatment had ceased. The avilamycin-resistance gene was characterized by PCR as the emtA gene and speciation by PCR. MIC profiling confirmed that more than one strain of Ent. faecalis carried this gene. There was no evidence of increased antimicrobial resistance in the E. coli, Salmonella and Campylobacter populations, although there was a higher incidence of tetB positive E. coli in the treated pigs than the controls. CONCLUSION: Although avilamycin selects for resistance in the native enterococci population of the pig, no resistant isolates were detected beyond 1 week post-treatment. This suggests that resistant isolates were unable to persist once selective pressure was removed and were out-competed by the sensitive microflora. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Our data suggest the risk of resistant isolates becoming carcass contaminants and infecting humans could be minimized by introducing a withdrawal period after using avilamycin and prior to slaughter.
TI  - Bacteria induce expression of apoptosis in human spermatozoa.
AB  - An increased number of sperm undergoing apoptosis has been observed during inflammatory processes in the male genital tract, which might be associated with elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. However, another factor to stimulate apoptosis could be the direct contact with bacteria or its products, even in the absence of ROS. The aim of this study was to investigate whether bacteria can directly initiate apoptosis in human spermatozoa. Human spermatozoa selected by density gradient centrifugation were incubated with polymorphonuclear granulocytes (PMN) isolated from blood and/or E. faecalis, E. coli or S. aureus. As ROS inductor in PMN, phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate was used. After incubating the cells for 60 min at 37 degrees C, ROS were determined by chemiluminescence and phosphatidyl serine (PS) externalization was analyzed by flow cytometry with Annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide (PI). The increase in the percentage of spermatozoa Annexin V-FITC-positive/ PI-negative (early event of late apoptosis) was significant after the incubation with PMN plus PMA, PMN plus E. coli and E. coli alone. The percentage of spermatozoa Annexin V-FITC-positive/ PI-positive (apoptosis/necrosis) increased significantly in sperm incubated with E. coli and S. aureus (20.3% +/- 3 and 13.6% +/- 3.2 compared to sperm alone, 6% +/- 0.5). Sperm incubated with PMN-PMA activated showed only a relative increase in apoptosis/necrosis (8.4% +/- 1). Our results show that bacteria directly increase the PS externalisation in ejaculated human sperm. This way of inducing apoptosis does not require external ROS and may result from anyone of the molecular mechanisms that account for changes in motility, vitality and DNA integrity, that are characteristics of spermatozoa in male genital tract infection.
TI  - Pollution status of swimming pools in south-south zone of south-eastern Nigeria using microbiological and physicochemical indices.
AB  - Microbiological and physicochemical characteristics of swimming pools in South Eastern states of Nigeria (Akwa Ibom and Cross River) were investigated. The bacterial isolates included Enterococcus faecalis, Clostridium perfringens, Bacillus cereus and Escherichia coli. Others were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus vulgaris and Staphylococcus epidermidis, while fungal isolates were Penicillium sp, Rhizopus sp, Aspergillus versicolor Fusarium sp, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Mucor sp, Candida albicans, Aspergillus niger and Absidia sp. The total viable count of microorganims in Ibeno (B) and Uyo (E) swimming pools were 6 x 10(6) cfu/ml and for Calabar (H) swimming pool, 3.3 x 10(7) cfu/ml. The total coliform counts were 10(6) cfu/100 ml for Calabar (G) swimming pools and 2 x 10(7) cfu/100 ml for Calabar (H) swimming pools while the fungal count ranged from 5 x 10(6) cfu/ml to 3 x 10(7) cfu/ml. Physical and chemical parameters known to be hazardous to health were also identified. The presence of high levels of coliform and fecal coliform bacteria (E. coli) revelaed that the swimming pools have not met the World Health Organization (WHO) standard for recreational waters. The swimming pools constitute a serious public health hazard.
TI  - Dynamic modification of microorganisms by pyrenebutanoate for fluorometric detection in capillary zone electrophoresis.
AB  - Pyrenebutanoate, a fluorescent amphiphilic probe, is suggested here as a capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) buffer additive for dynamic modification and analysis of microbial cells. Mixed cultures of microorganisms Escherichia coli, Candida albicans, Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus epidermidis were concentrated, resolved by CZE and detected. Using UV excitation for on-column fluorometric detection, a detection sensitivity for the microorganisms on the order of from one to tens of injected cells was achieved.
TI  - High hydrostatic pressure inactivation of vegetative microorganisms, aerobic and  anaerobic spores in pork Marengo, a low acidic particulate food product.
AB  - To prolong the shelf-life of particulate food products, high pressure processing  is one of the emerging technologies to be studied as an alternative to classical pasteurization and sterilization by heat. Pork Marengo (a low acidic, partially prepared stew of pieces pork, carrots and peas) was inoculated with several strains of sporulating and vegetative microorganisms. The microbial spoilage of the product was evaluated after a high pressure treatment of 400 MPa during 30 min at, respectively, 20 and 50 degrees C. Several Clostridium spp. and Bacillus spp. survived the treatment, and the Gram-positive cocci Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus were revealed to be more pressure resistant than Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the Gram-negative bacteria Pseudomonas fluorescens and Escherichia coli. The high pressure treatment at 20 degrees C demonstrated that high pressure processing (HPP) of neutral-pH foods cannot rely on pressure alone as a pasteurization/sterilization process. Another physical agent like heat is needed. High pressure treatment at 50 degrees C demonstrated that heat transfer limitations in particulate food products still can trouble their successful pasteurization/sterilization.
TI  - Structure-guided mutational analysis of the nucleotidyltransferase domain of Escherichia coli NAD+-dependent DNA ligase (LigA).
AB  - NAD+-dependent DNA ligase (LigA) is essential for bacterial growth and a potential target for antimicrobial drug discovery. Here we queried the role of 14 conserved amino acids of Escherichia coli LigA by alanine scanning and thereby identified five new residues within the nucleotidyltransferase domain as being essential for LigA function in vitro and in vivo. Structure activity relationships were determined by conservative mutagenesis for the Glu-173, Arg-200, Arg-208, and Arg-277 side chains, as well as four other essential side chains that had been identified previously (Lys-115, Asp-117, Asp-285, and Lys-314). In addition, we identified Lys-290 as important for LigA activity. Reference to the structure of Enterococcus faecalis LigA allowed us to discriminate three classes of essential/important side chains that: (i) contact NAD+ directly (Lys-115, Glu-173, Lys-290, and Lys-314); (ii) comprise the interface between the NMN-binding domain (domain Ia) and the nucleotidyltransferase domain or comprise part of a nick-binding site on the surface of the nucleotidyltransferase domain (Arg-200 and Arg-208); or (iii) stabilize the active site fold of the nucleotidyltransferase domain (Arg-277). Analysis of mutational effects on the isolated ligase adenylylation and phosphodiester formation reactions revealed different functions for essential side chains at different steps of the DNA ligase pathway, consistent with the proposal that the active site is serially remodeled as the reaction proceeds.
TI  - Characterization of transferable tetracycline resistance genes in Enterococcus faecalis isolated from raw food.
AB  - The prevalence of tetracycline resistance, and of specific genetic determinants for this resistance was investigated in 1003 strains of Enterococcus faecalis isolated from various raw food products originating from five categories including chicken meat, other poultry meat, beef, pork, and 'other'. For the 238 resistant isolates identified, the ability to transfer the resistant phenotype to a given recipient in vitro was investigated. New and interesting observations were that the tet(L) resistance determinant was more readily transferred than tet(M), and that the presence of Tn916-like elements known to encode tet(M) did not correlate with increased transferability of the resistant phenotype.
TI  - Influence of various criteria for elimination of duplicates when calculating the  prevalence and antibiotic susceptibility of microorganisms associated with urinary infections.
AB  - The effect of applying various criteria for elimination of repeated isolates in the same patient on the prevalence and antibiotic susceptibility of microorganisms frequently associated with urinary infections were analyzed. When time criteria were applied, there was a decrease in the number of isolates of 13.4-27.5%, whereas when variations in antibiotic susceptibility were considered, between 4.3 and 20.3% of the isolates were eliminated. The absolute number of isolates varied considerably depending on which of these two criteria were used, but neither criterion was seen to modify significantly the antibiotic susceptibility of these microorganisms and this confirms the recommendations of the NCCLS for this group of pathogens.
TI  - Interlaboratory proficiency testing as a tool for improving performance in laboratories diagnosing bovine mastitis.
AB  - The National Veterinary and Food Research Institute (Finland) and the Veterinary  Laboratories Agency of the Quality Assurance Unit, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, United Kingdom (previously the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food) organized a proficiency testing program for laboratories analyzing veterinary mastitis samples. Three test samples with lyophilized strains of common aerobic bacteria were sent to the participating laboratories 7 times between 2000 and 2003. The participants returned 98% of the requested data. The overall performance of the laboratories varied from 63 to 93% in different testing rounds. All laboratories diagnosed Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli correctly at every round. Improvement in diagnosing individual bacteria was observed for Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Enterococcus spp. and Klebsiella spp. The overall performance of the laboratories improved with increased participation. The educational role of the program was important. Laboratories working in the veterinary field should implement a documented quality system covering all functions of the laboratory, as well as a planned quality assurance system.
TI  - Whole blood-mediated endothelial permeability and adhesion molecule expression: a model study into the effects of bacteria and antibiotics.
AB  - AIM: To investigate whether the inflammatory response of cultured endothelial cells, as induced by conditioned plasma, depends on the bacterial species or type of antibiotic used for incubation with whole blood. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Blood from healthy volunteers was stimulated ex vivo with different microorganisms, and with bacteria killed with different antibiotics. The resultant plasmas were incubated on monolayers of cultured human endothelial cells, followed by measurement of their permeability to albumin and expression of E-selectin and intercellular adhesion molecule-1. RESULTS: Incubation of Escherichia coli in blood yielded plasmas that induced a marked increase in endothelial permeability and E-selectin expression. The response to Bacteroides fragilis or Enterococcus faecalis was generally weaker. Similar effects were observed after incubation of whole blood with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Much of the permeability and adhesion molecule response to E. coli remained after removal of intact microorganisms from the culture. Whereas antibiotic treatment of E. coli with imipenem or cefuroxime resulted in a divergent production of tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in blood, no significant differences between these treatments were observed with respect to the plasma-induced endothelial response. CONCLUSION: Bacteria differ in their capacity to generate a whole blood-mediated increase of endothelial permeability and adhesion molecule expression; this response depends, at least in part, on the presence of soluble bacterial components, such as LPS. Whereas treatment with various antibiotics may generate varying amounts of TNF-alpha, these differences are not translated into differences in endothelial permeability or adhesion molecule expression.
TI  - [Effect of delay of blood cultures on positive detection by automated blood culture system].
AB  - The effect of entry delayed blood culture bottles until the start of incubation for mechanical detection of organism were compared using 2 major blood culture systems; BACTEC 9240 system and BacT/ALERT 3D system. Total of 13 bacterial strains; 5 gram-positive cocci, 7 gram-negative bacilli and Candida parapsilosis which were isolated mainly from blood cultures were used as the test strains. BACTEC 92F, 93F and BacT/ALERT FA, FN bottles were used as the blood culture bottles. All the bottles inoculated with the test strains were incubated and evaluated immediately after standing at room temperature for 24, 42, 48, 54 or 72 hours, using the respective automated blood culture systems. All the bottles were subcultured. The effect of entry delay the blood culture bottles for the mechanical detection was observed in many gram-negative organisms in BACTEC 9240 system. The blood cultures were evaluated not to be positive in 4 of the 10 samples on delaying for 24 hours or in any of the samples on delaying for 42 hours in the BACTEC 92F bottles inoculated with Escherichia coli. In Serratia marcescens, the blood cultures were evaluated not to be positive in 5 of the 10 samples on delaying for 24 hours or in any of the samples on delaying for 42 hours in the BACTEC 92F bottles. In Klebsiella pneumoniae, the blood cultures were evaluated not to be positive in 9 of the 10 samples on delaying for 42 hours. In Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis, the blood cultures were evaluated not to be positive in 5-6 of the 10 samples on delaying for 42 hours. On the other hand, the blood cultures were evaluated to be positive in most of the samples of Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (except 3 of the 10 samples which were evaluated not to be positive) on delaying for 42 hours in BacT/ALERT 3 D system. The samples except part of Streptococcus spp. were detected by subculture in both the bottles. These results indicate that the delayed time of blood culture bottles before inoculation with the test bacterial samples affects the positive detection of blood cultures markedly in the blood culture system. Therefore, the immediate incubation was considered to be necessary.
TI  - Susceptibility of some oral microorganisms to chlorhexidine and paramonochlorophenol.
AB  - Since the use of antimicrobial agents is required in endodontic therapies, this study aimed at determining the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of chlorhexidine digluconate and paramonochlorophenol (PMC) against microorganisms commonly found in endodontic infections. Both agents were tested by agar dilution tests against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Candida albicans, Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Prevotella denticola and Prevotella melaninogenica. The MIC of chlorhexidine ranged from 2.67 to 80.00 microg/ml, and the MIC of PMC from 46.67 to 213.33 microg/ml. The highest MIC value of PMC was detected for E. faecalis whereas E. coli was the most susceptible microorganism to this agent. The highest MIC values of chlorhexidine were observed for P. aeruginosa whereas E. coli and P. denticola were the most susceptible microorganisms to this agent. Since the MIC values observed are much lower than the concentrations currently used in the endodontic therapy, it is suggested that both agents are effective in reducing the microbiota in the root canal.
TI  - Production of mevalonate by a metabolically-engineered Escherichia coli.
AB  - Mevalonate is biosynthesized from acetyl-CoA and metabolized to isoprenoid compounds in a wide variety of organisms although certain types of prokaryotes employ another route for isoprenoid biosynthesis (the non-mevalonate pathway). To establish a fermentative process for mevalonate production, enzymes for mevalonate synthesis from Enterococcus faecalis were expressed in Escherichia coli, a non-mevalonate pathway bacterium. Mevalonate was accumulated, indicating a redirection of acetate metabolism by the expressed enzyme. The recombinant E. coli produced 47 g mevalonate l(-1) in 50 h of fed-batch cultivation in a 2 l jar fermenter; this is the highest titer ever reported demonstrating the superiority of E. coli in its ability of acetyl-CoA supply and its inability is degrade mevalonate.
TI  - Towards the establishment and standardization of a veterinary antimicrobial resistance surveillance and monitoring programme in South Africa.
AB  - The objective of this study was to establish a repeatable, standardized laboratory procedure for monitoring the development of antimicrobial resistance in bacteria isolated from animals and food of animal origin in South Africa, with reagents prepared in-house. The emergence of resistance and the spread of resistant bacteria can be limited by implementing a veterinary antimicrobial drug policy, in which inter alia systematic monitoring and prudent use play essential roles. The bacteria included in this study represented three different categories, namely zoonotic bacteria (Salmonella), indicator bacteria (Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium) and veterinary pathogens (Mannheimia haemolytica). Thirty isolates of each species were collected with the aim of standardizing the laboratory methodology for a future national veterinary surveillance and monitoring programme. Susceptibility to ten selected antimicrobial drugs was determined by means of minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) using the microdilution method. The method according to the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards was used as the standard. Multi-well plates containing varying dilutions of antimicrobial drugs and prepared in-house for MIC determinations, yielded repeatable results. Storage of plates for 2 months at -70 degrees C did not influence results meaningfully. Within this limited sample of bacteria, MIC results did not indicate meaningful resistance against any of the ten selected antimicrobial drugs. The findings of the study will be used to establish a national veterinary antimicrobial resistance surveillance and monitoring programme in South Africa. To allow for international comparison of data, harmonisation of the surveillance and monitoring programme in accordance with global trends is encouraged. Ideally it should be combined with a programme monitoring the quantities of antimicrobial drugs used. The aim is to contribute to slowing down the emergence of resistance and the problems associated with this phenomenon by means of the rational use of antimicrobial drugs.
TI  - Activation of the complement system generates antibacterial peptides.
AB  - The complement system represents an evolutionary old and significant part of the  innate immune system involved in protection against invading microorganisms. Here, we show that the anaphylatoxin C3a and its inactivated derivative C3a-desArg are antibacterial, demonstrating a previously unknown direct antimicrobial effect of complement activation. The C3a peptide, as well as functional epitopes in the sequence, efficiently killed the Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and the Gram-positive Enterococcus faecalis. In mice, a C3a-derived peptide suppressed infection by Gram-positive Streptococcus pyogenes bacteria. Fluorescence and electron microscopy demonstrated that C3a binds to and induces breaks in bacterial membranes. C3a was also found to induce membrane leakage of liposomes. These findings provide an interesting link between the complement system and antimicrobial peptides, which are two important branches of innate immunity.
TI  - Syntheses, in vitro antibacterial and cytotoxic activities of a series of 3-substituted succinimides.
AB  - We have synthesized a series of 3-substituted succinimides and their in vitro antibacterial activities have been tested towards Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria from the ATCC collection. Some of them possess significant antibacterial activity against Gram-positive organisms (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 and Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212) but all are poorly active or inactive against Gram-negative organisms (Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853). The compounds with the lowest minimal inhibitory concentrations (esters of 3-hydroxy succinimides) are also the most cytotoxic against green monkey Vero cell line (ATCC CCL-81) and could explain that perhaps apoptosis should be implicated in eukaryotic cell cytotoxicity of succinimides.
TI  - The circular bacteriocins gassericin A and circularin A.
AB  - Gassericin A, a bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus gasseri LA39, shows antibacterial activity against a number of Gram-positive food-borne pathogenic bacteria. Circularin A produced by Clostridium beijerinckii ATCC25752 is active against C. tyrobutyricum, a known cheese-spoilage bacterium. Both bacteriocins were purified to homogeneity from culture supernatants by reverse-phase chromatography and the subsequently determined amino acid sequences were used to clone the bacteriocin structural genes. Mature gassericin A and circularin A are class V circular bacteriocins comprised of 58 and 69 amino acid residues, respectively. Both bacteriocins are resistant to several peptidases and proteases, as are other cyclic bacteriocins. Heterologous expression of gassericin A in Escherichia coli was used to produce a non-cyclic mature peptide, which was shown to have a specific activity 173-fold lower than the circular molecule. The minimal region for production and secretion of active circularin A is comprised of five genes, as was deduced by heterologous gene expression in Enterococcus faecalis. Gassericin A and circularin A have limited mutual similarity in their primary sequences. Unlike most bacteriocins, including gassericin A, circularin A has a three-amino-acid-leader sequence.
TI  - In vitro exposure of bacteria to antimicrobial impregnated-central venous catheters does not directly lead to the emergence of antimicrobial resistance.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Use of central venous catheters (CVCs) impregnated with minocycline and rifampin reduces the density of bacterial growth on catheters and decreases the incidence of catheter-related bloodstream infections. Questions have been raised over the possibility that the use of these catheters will lead to the emergence of antibiotic-resistant organisms. In this study, we sought to determine if in vitro exposure of four test organisms to catheter segments impregnated with minocycline and rifampin would lead to the development of antibiotic resistance. METHODS: Catheter segments (1.0 cm) were placed on the surface of agar plates previously inoculated with bacterial suspensions, such that a subconfluent lawn of colony growth would be apparent after 24 h incubation at 35 degrees C in air. Test organisms included American Type Culture Collection strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Zones of inhibition of colony growth surrounding catheters were measured at 24-h intervals up to 7 days (two catheter segments per test). Colonies on agar surfaces located at varying distances from catheter segments were examined for minocycline and rifampin resistance following various periods of exposure (six catheter segments per test). In addition, selected colonies were subsequently exposed to minocycline and rifampin in broth and examined for selection of minocycline and rifampin resistance (> 28 colonies per selection test). RESULTS: Inhibitory zones of 14 to 47 mm were observed with S aureus, S epidermidis, E faecalis, and E coli. Growth of P aeruginosa was not inhibited by CVC segments. Testing of colonies of the first four organisms at various distances from CVC segments after varying periods of exposure revealed only a single instance of the emergence of resistance (eg, S aureus vs rifampin). Recovery of resistant clones was enhanced with minocycline and rifampin broth selection; however, a direct link between CVC exposure and the emergence of resistance was not established. CONCLUSIONS: Our in vitro data suggest that the exposure of Gram-positive cocci to either rifampin or minocycline can lead to the development of resistance. However, exposure of bacteria to these antibiotics in combination does not directly lead to resistance. Clinical investigations will be required to determine the true risk and implications of the development of resistance.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (2002). III. Secular changes in susceptibility].
AB  - The bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) isolated from patients diagnosed as urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 13 institutions in Japan were supplied between August 2002 and July 2003. The susceptibilities of these bacteria to various antimicrobial agents were examined. The bacteria were divided into 2 groups consisting of uncomplicated UTIs and complicated UTIs (with and without indwelling catheter) based on their isolation origins. The results were compared with those obtained between 1993 and 2001. The drug sensitivity of S. aureus in this year was similar to those in up to the previous year and S. aureus showed the best susceptibility to vancomycin. The drug sensitivity of E. faecalis in this year also was similar to those in up to the previous year. The drug sensitivity of E. coli in this year was generally good except penicillins and was similar to those in up to the previous year. Among cephems, cefozopran (CZOP) and cefpirome (CPR) showed the highest potency (MIC90: < or = 0.125 microg/mL). An antibacterial activity of cefotiam (CTM) was similar to it in 10 years ago and was fine (MIC90: < or = 1 microg/mL). The sensitivity of E. coli to carbapenems and carumonam (CRMN) also was good like to CZOP. However, the sensitivity of the complicated UTIs group to quinolones decreased after 2000 and was suggested to develop the resistance to the drug. The drug sensitivity of Klebsiella spp. in this year also was similar to those in up to the previous year. The bacteria showed good susceptibility (MIC: < or = 0.125 microg/mL) to cefmenoxime (CMX), CPR, cefixime (CFIX), flomoxef (FMOX), and CZOP among cephems. The drug sensitivity of P. aeruginosa was generally low. Most of the bacteria were little sensitive to cephems except CZOP and ceftazidime (CAZ). The sensitive bacteria to CZOP and ceftazidime (CAZ) were observed to be 26.8% (15/56 strains) and 39.3% (22/56 strains) in complicated UTIs group, respectively. The sensitivity profile of P. aeruginosa to the other tested drugs was not much different from that in up to the previous year. However, the sensitivity of the bacteria to carbapenems tended to decrease after 2000, and the low sensitive strains (MIC: > or = 256 microg/mL) were detected at 22.2% (2/9 strains) in the uncomplicated UTIs group and 3.6% (2/56 strains) in the complicated UTIs group.
TI  - Screening of lactic-acid bacteria from South African barley beer for the production of bacteriocin-like compounds.
AB  - Strains of Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei (strain ST11BR), L. pentosus  (strain ST151BR), L. plantarum (strain ST13BR), and Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (strain ST34BR) producing bacteriocin-like peptides were isolated from barley beer produced in the Western, Northern and Eastern provinces of South Africa. The peptides (bacST11BR, bacST151BR, bacST13BR and bacST34BR) lost their activity after treatment with proteinase K, a proteinase, papain, chymotrypsin, trypsin, pepsin and pronase, but not when they were treated with alpha-amylase, suggesting that the peptides are not glycosylated. The peptides inhibited the growth of Lactobacillus casei, L. sakei, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis, but not Enterobacter cloacae, Lactobacillus bulgaricus subsp. delbrueckii, L. plantarum, L. salivarius, Listeria innocua, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus uberis, S. agalactiae, S. caprinus and S. pneumoniae. Peptides bacST11BR and bacST13BR differed from the other 2 peptides by failing to kill Klebsiella pneumoniae and one of the E. coli strains. Peptides were stable after 2 h of incubation at pH 2.0-12.0, and after 90 min at 100 degrees C. When autoclaved (121 degrees C, 20 min), only bacST13BR lost its activity. The bacteriocin-like peptides were produced at a growth temperature of 30 degrees C, but not at 37 degrees C.
TI  - Expression cloning and demonstration of Enterococcus faecalis lipoamidase (pyruvate dehydrogenase inactivase) as a Ser-Ser-Lys triad amidohydrolase.
AB  - Enterococcus faecalis lipoamidase was discovered almost 50 years ago (Reed, L. J., Koike, M., Levitch, M. E., and Leach, F. R. (1958) J. Biol. Chem. 232, 143-158) as an enzyme activity that cleaved lipoic acid from small lipoylated molecules and from pyruvate dehydrogenase thereby inactivating the enzyme. Although the partially purified enzyme was a key reagent in proving the crucial role of protein-bound lipoic acid in the reaction mechanism of the 2-oxoacid dehydrogenases, the identity of the lipoamidase protein and the encoding gene remained unknown. We report isolation of the lipoamidase gene by screening an expression library made in an unusual cosmid vector in which the copy number of the vector is readily varied from 1-2 to 40-80 in an appropriate Escherichia coli host. Although designed for manipulation of large genome segments, the vector was also ideally suited to isolation of the gene encoding the extremely toxic lipoamidase. The gene encoding lipoamidase was isolated by screening for expression in E. coli and proved to encode an unexpectedly large protein (80 kDa) that contained the sequence signature of the Ser-Ser-Lys triad amidohydrolase family. The hexa-histidine-tagged protein was expressed in E. coli and purified to near-homogeneity. The purified enzyme was found to cleave both small molecule lipoylated and biotinylated substrates as well as lipoic acid from two 2-oxoacid dehydrogenases and an isolated lipoylated lipoyl domain derived from the pyruvate dehydrogenase E2 subunit. Lipoamidase-mediated inactivation of the 2-oxoacid dehydrogenases was observed both in vivo and in vitro. Mutagenesis studies showed that the residues of the Ser-Ser-Lys triad were required for activity on both small molecule and protein substrates and confirmed that lipoamidase is a member of the Ser-Ser-Lys triad amidohydrolase family.
TI  - A practical synthesis of gramicidin s and sugar amino Acid containing analogues.
AB  - A practical gram-scale and high-yielding synthesis of the antimicrobial peptide gramicidin S is presented. An Fmoc-based solid-phase peptide synthesis protocol is employed for the generation of the linear decapeptide precursor, which is cyclized in solution to afford the target compound. The versatility of our method is demonstrated by the construction of eight gramicidin S analogues (15a-h) having nonproteinogenic sugar amino acid residues (4-7) incorporated in the turn regions.
TI  - Sufentanil modifies the antibacterial activity of bupivacaine and ropivacaine.
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of our study was to investigate the effect on the growth of  Escherichia coli (E. coli), Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), and Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis) of bupivacaine at a final concentration of 0.77 mg.mL(-1), ropivacaine at 1.2 mg.mL(-1), and sufentanil at 0.38 and 0.5 microg.mL(-1) (alone or in combination with bupivacaine and ropivacaine). METHODS: The strains were diluted to approximately 3 x 10(4) cfu.mL(-1) in Mueller-Hinton broth. The anesthetics (0.5 mL) were incubated with the bacterial suspensions (0.5 mL) for 24 hr at 37 degrees C. RESULTS: Bupivacaine inhibited the growth of E. coli (59 +/- 0.8%; P < 0.05) and S. aureus (22 +/- 3.6%; P < 0.05). Ropivacaine also inhibited the growth of E. coli (41 +/- 1.2%; P < 0.05) and S. aureus (25.5 +/- 4.1%; P < 0.05). Both anesthetics were ineffective against E. faecalis. Sufentanil only inhibited S. aureus (13.8 +/- 3.1%; P < 0.05) at a concentration of 0.5 microg.mL(-1). Sufentanil modified the antibacterial activity of bupivacaine and ropivacaine. It increased the inhibitory effect of bupivacaine on E. faecalis and S. aureus by 10 +/- 2.1% (P < 0.05) and on E. coli by 7% (P < 0.05). Sufentanil did not increase the inhibitory effect of ropivacaine on the growth of S. aureus. On the other hand, sufentanil reduced the inhibitory effect of ropivacaine on E. coli by 11% (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Both bupivacaine and ropivacaine alone or combined with sufentanil inhibited the growth of E. coli and S. aureus. E. faecalis was partially sensitive to a bupivacaine + sufentanil mixture. Sufentanil had a partial synergistic effect on bupivacaine and a partial antagonistic effect on ropivacaine's antibacterial activity.
TI  - Characterisation of viridans group streptococci with different levels of Tet(M)-mediated tetracycline resistance.
AB  - Streptococcus oralis 264-3, Streptococcus mitis 254-1 and S. mitis 264-1, isolated from the oral cavities of two children were each found to carry the tet(M) gene but exhibited different degrees of reduced susceptibility to tetracycline (tetracycline MICs of 2, 8 and 64 mg/L, respectively). The aim of this study was to determine the molecular basis for the different levels of tetracycline resistance (Tc(R)) observed. Escherichia coli HB101 carrying the cloned tet(M) genes exhibited similar levels of tetracycline susceptibility to those observed in the parental streptococcal strains (MICs of 1, 16, and 64 mg/L for tet(M) genes from S. oralis 264-3, S. mitis 254-1 and S. mitis 264-1, respectively). DNA sequencing revealed that S. oralis 264-3 had a tet(M) gene highly homologous to tet(M) carried by Tn916 from Enterococcus faecalis (99.6% identity), while the intermediate- and high-level Tc(R) strains had tet(M) sequences that resembled the tet(M) gene of Tn5251 from Streptococcus pneumoniae (99.3% and 99.4% identity, respectively). No differences were observed in the upstream attenuator structure for each of the strains and differences in reduced tetracycline susceptibilities could be attributed to changes in the deduced amino acid sequences of the Tet(M) proteins.
TI  - Cyclic dipeptides exhibit synergistic, broad spectrum antimicrobial effects and have anti-mutagenic properties.
AB  - Cyclic dipeptides are known to have antiviral, antibiotic and antitumour properties. The aim of this study was to determine the combined effects of cyclo(L-leucyl-L-prolyl) and cyclo(L-phenylalanyl-L-prolyl) on the growth of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and pathogenic yeasts, as well as determining their anti-mutagenic effects. This drug combination was especially effective against five VRE strains: Enterococcus faecium (K-99-38), E. faecalis (K-99-17), E. faecalis (K-99-258), E. faecium (K-01-312) and E. faecalis (K-01-511) with MIC values of 0.25-1 mg/l. It was also effective against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Micrococcus luteus, Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans with MIC values of 0.25-0.5 mg/l. In addition, the cyclic dipeptides exerted anti-mutagenic activity against Salmonella typhimurium TA98 and TA100 strains in a Salmonella mutation assay. The number of mutant colonies of S. typhimurium strains TA98 and TA100 induced by exposure to AF-2 (0.2 microg/plate) decreased in a concentration-dependent manner in the presence of the two cyclic dipeptides (correlation 0.72 and 0.78, respectively). Here, for the first time, we report synergistic effects of the cyclic dipeptides [cyclo(L-leu-L-pro) and cyclo(L-phe-L-pro)] in inhibiting the growth of pathogenic microorganisms, as well as their anti-mutagenic effects in Salmonella strains.
TI  - [Surveillance of antimicrobial resistance: VIRA study 2004].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The objective of the study was to know the current situation of the antimicrobial sensitivity patterns of the main multi-resistant bacteria and to analyze any possible changes with respect to the VIRA study carried out in 2001. METHODS: The 40 participating hospitals sent a total of 1,425 microorganisms isolated in February 2004, distributed as follows: penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (139), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (289), clinically significant coagulase-negative staphylococci (158), ampicillin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (89) and Enterococcus faecalis (2), ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae (85), ciprofloxacin-resistant Escherichia coli (346), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (187), and Acinetobacter baumannii (130). The hospitals provided epidemiological data on these microorganisms. Sensitivity was determined by the broth microdilution method. RESULTS: The number of highly penicillin-resistant pneumococci fell significantly (p < 0.0001) compared with the previous study (from 59.8% to 30.2%). Global methicillin-resistance in S. aureus was 31.2%, which represents a significant increase (p < 0.001) compared with the year 2001 (24.8%). 11.3% of the E. coli strains were extended-spectrum beta -lactamase-producers and came from 24 hospitals. One P. aeruginosa isolate gave a positive result in the E-test MBL assay, suggesting the presence of metallo-beta -lactamases. The strains of imipenem-resistant A. baumannii presented cross-resistance with several antibiotics. CONCLUSION: These results show how the multi-resistant bacteria included in the study represent a growing problem in our hospitals. This emphasizes the importance of resistance surveillance systems and the correct use of antimicrobial agents.
TI  - Optimization of bacteriocin production by Lactobacillus plantarum ST13BR, a strain isolated from barley beer.
AB  - The cell-free supernatant containing bacteriocin ST13BR, produced by Lactobacillus plantarum ST13BR, inhibits the growth of L. casei, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli. Based on tricine-SDS-PAGE, bacteriocin ST13BR is 10 kDa in size. Complete inactivation or significant reduction in bacteriocin activity was observed after treatment with Proteinase K, trypsin and pronase, but not with catalase or alpha-amylase. Low bacteriocin activity (200 AU/ml) was recorded in BHI medium, M17 broth, 10% (w/v) soy milk, and 2% and 10% (w/v) molasses, despite good growth. Maximal bacteriocin activity (6,400 AU/ml) was recorded after 23 h in MRS broth, but only at 30 degrees C. Tween 80 in MRS broth increased bacteriocin production by more than 50%. Meat extract or yeast extract as sole nitrogen source, or a combination of the two (1 : 1) in MRS broth, stimulated bacteriocin production (6,400 AU/ml). Only 50% activity (3,200 AU/ml) was recorded with tryptone as sole nitrogen source, whereas a combination of tryptone, meat extract and yeast extract yielded 6,400 AU/ml. Bacteriocin production was not stimulated by the addition of glucose at 2.0% w/v (3,200 AU/ml), nor 2% (w/v) fructose, sucrose, lactose or mannose, respectively (800 AU/ml). Activity levels less than 200 AU/ml were recorded in the presence of 0.05% to 0.5% (w/v) maltose. Maximal bacteriocin production (6,400 AU/ml) was recorded in the presence of 2% (w/v) maltose. Maltose at 4.0% (w/v) led to a 50% reduction of bacteriocin activity. The presence of 1.0% (w/v) and higher KH(2)PO(4), or glycerol at 0.2% (w/v) suppressed bacteriocin production.
TI  - Inhibitory activity of 2-nitropropanol against select food-borne pathogens in vitro.
AB  - AIMS: To test the inhibitory activity of 2-nitro-1-propanol (2NPOH) against Salmonella Typhimurium, Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Enterococcus faecalis. METHODS AND RESULTS: Specific growth rates (h(-1)) of S. Typhimurium, E. coli O157:H7 and Ent. faecalis were determined during culture in tryptic soya broth (TSB) supplemented with 0-10 mm 2NPOH. Growth rates were inhibited by 2NPOH, with nearly complete inhibition observed with 10 mm. Studies with S. Typhimurium revealed that its survivability during culture in TSB containing 5 or 10 mm 2NPOH was lower (P < 0.05) under aerobic than anaerobic conditions. The survivability of Salmonella during anaerobic culture in TSB containing 2.5 mm 2NPOH was less at pH 5.6 than at pH 7.0 and 8.0. No Salmonella survived anaerobic incubation in TSB supplemented with 10 mm 2NPOH regardless of pH. When incubated in suspensions of freshly collected populations of ruminal and faecal bacteria, Salmonella concentrations were lower (P < 0.05) in suspensions containing 10 mm 2NPOH than in suspensions containing no 2NPOH. CONCLUSIONS: 2NPOH inhibited S. Typhimurium, E. coli O157:H7 and Ent. faecalis. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Results suggest that 2NPOH may be a useful antimicrobial supplement to reduce carriage of certain food-borne pathogens in food animals.
TI  - Synthesis and potent antimicrobial activity of some novel 4-(5, 6-dichloro-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl)-N-substituted benzamides.
AB  - A series of 4-(5, 6-dichloro-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl)-N-substituted benzamides were  synthesized and evaluated for antibacterial and antifungal activities against Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), methicillin-resistant S. epidermis (MRSE), Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli and Candida albicans. Certain compounds inhibit bacterial growth with low MIC values (microg/mL). Among them, compounds 10 and 11 exhibited the greatest antibacterial activity with MIC values of 3.12 microg/mL against S. aureus, MRSA and MRSE.
TI  - Detection of low levels of Listeria monocytogenes cells by using a fiber-optic immunosensor.
AB  - Biosensor technology has a great potential to meet the need for sensitive and nearly real-time microbial detection from foods. An antibody-based fiber-optic biosensor to detect low levels of Listeria monocytogenes cells following an enrichment step was developed. The principle of the sensor is a sandwich immunoassay where a rabbit polyclonal antibody was first immobilized on polystyrene fiber waveguides through a biotin-streptavidin reaction to capture Listeria cells on the fiber. Capture of cells on the fibers was confirmed by scanning electron microscopy. A cyanine 5-labeled murine monoclonal antibody, C11E9, was used to generate a specific fluorescent signal, which was acquired by launching a 635-nm laser light from an Analyte 2000 and collected by a photodetector at 670 to 710 nm. This immunosensor was specific for L. monocytogenes and showed a significantly higher signal strength than for other Listeria species or other microorganisms, including Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Salmonella enterica, Lactobacillus plantarum, Carnobacterium gallinarum, Hafnia alvei, Corynebacterium glutamicum, Enterobacter aerogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Serratia marcescens, in pure or in mixed-culture setup. Fiber-optic results could be obtained within 2.5 h of sampling. The sensitivity threshold was about 4.3 x 10(3) CFU/ml for a pure culture of L. monocytogenes grown at 37 degrees C. When L. monocytogenes was mixed with lactic acid bacteria or grown at 10 degrees C with 3.5% NaCl, the detection threshold was 4.1 x 10(4) or 2.8 x 10(7) CFU/ml, respectively. In less than 24 h, this method could detect L. monocytogenes in hot dog or bologna naturally contaminated or artificially inoculated with 10 to 1,000 CFU/g after enrichment in buffered Listeria enrichment broth.
TI  - Use of simulated blood cultures for antibiotic effect on time to detection of the two blood culture systems BacT/ALERT and BACTEC 9240.
AB  - To avoid the influence of pre-analytical steps, this study was performed using sterile blood spiked with defined loads of microorganisms as inoculum. Time-to-Detection (TTD) was evaluated for the most frequently encountered bacteria comparing two commercially available blood culture systems, BD BACTEC 9240 (Becton Dickinson) and BacT/ALERT (Organon Teknika). The effect of the most widely used antibiotics on TTD was evaluated on both systems. TTD was measured with antibiotics at their trough and at increasing concentrations. The results show that the BACTEC PLUS system recovers more pathogens with shorter time to detection than the BacT/ALERT FAN system when beta-lactam antibiotics (Ampicillin, Cefotaxime) are present at their respective trough concentration corresponding to parenteral therapy. The two systems seem to be equally efficient when Gentamicin, Ciprofloxacin and Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole are used; in the case of Vancomycin, BACTEC seems more effective than BacT/ALERT.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (2002). II. Background of patients].
AB  - A total of 615 bacterial strains isolated from 491 patients diagnosed as having urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 13 institutions in Japan were supplied between August 2002 and July 2003. Then, the clinical background of patients were investigated such as sex, age, and type of infections and kind of bacteria, frequency of bacteria isolation by age and infections, bacteria and infections by timing of antibiotics administration, and bacteria and infections by surgical procedures. The bacterial strains were divided by the age and sex of the patients and the types of infections. In males, the number of patients aged less than 50 years was few and the complicated UTIs without indwelling catheter was observed most frequently. In the present time, the bacteria most frequently isolated were Escherichia coli. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus faecalis were also relatively frequently isolated. E. coli decreased and P. aeruginosa increased with the complication of the infections. E. faecalis tended to be isolated more frequently in the complicated UTIs than in the uncomplicated UTIs. With respect to the relation of these results to the age of the patients, in the uncomplicated UTIs, the isolation frequency of E. coli was the highest in all age groups, accounting for 70.8% in 20-49 years old. In the complicated UTIs without indwelling catheter, the isolation frequency of E. coli decreased with aging of the patients and was lower than that of E. faecalis in the patients aged 70 or more (18.3 vs 20.6%). In the complicated UTIs with indwelling catheter, the isolation frequency of E. coli was lower than in the uncomplicated UTIs in all age groups and P. aeruginosa and E. faecalis were more frequently isolated. In comparison of causative bacteria in UTIs between before and after the administration of antibiotics, E. coli decreased and P. aeruginosa increased after the administration in any UTIs. In comparison of causative bacteria in UTIs with or without surgery, E. coli was more frequently isolated in the patients without surgery, while P. aeruginosa was more in the patients with surgery in any UTIs. E. faecalis was more frequently isolated in the patients with surgery in uncomplicated and complicated UTIs without indwelling catheter and in the patients without surgery in complicated UTIs with indwelling catheter.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (2002). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The bacterial strains isolated from 491 patients diagnosed as having urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 13 institutions in Japan were supplied between August 2002 and July 2003. The susceptibilities of them to many kinds of antimicrobial agents were investigated. Of them, 578 strains were estimated as causative bacteria and used for the investigation. The number of them was 578 strains consisting of 177 gram-positive bacterial strains (30.6%) and 401 gram-negative bacterial strains (69.4%). Against Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin (VCM) showed a strong activity and prevented the growth of all strains with 1 microg/mL. The susceptibility of Staphylococcus epidermidis to cephems including cefotiam (CTM) was relatively good. Against Enterococcus faecalis, ampicillin (ABPC), imipenem (IPM), and VCM showed the strongest antibacterial activity (MIC90: 2-4 microg/mL). In addition, the low sensitive strains (MIC: > or = 256 microg/mL) to clarithromycin (CAM) were detected at 48.3% but none to cefozopran (CZOP). The antibacterial activity of cephems to Escherichia coli was generally good, and especially CZOP and cefpirome (CPR) showed the highest activity (MIC90: < or = 0.125 microg/mL). Quinolone resistant E. coli was detected at frequency of 13.5%, which was higher than that in the last year. The antibacterial activity of cephems to Citrobacter freundii was generally low but CZOP and CPR had a strong acitivity (MIC90: 0.25 and 0.5 microg/mL, respectively). The antibacterial activity of cephems to Klebsiella pneumoniae was good and especially cefmenoxime (CMX), cefixime (CFIX), flomoxef (FMOX), CPR, and CZOP showed stronger activity (MIC90: < or = 0.125 microg/mL). Against Serratia marcescens, meropenem (MEPM) had the highest antibacterial activity followed by CPR and CZOP. Against Proteus mirabilis, CMX, ceftazidime (CAZ), CPR, MEPM, carumonam (CRMN), and levofloxacin (LVFX) showed the strongest activity (MC90: < or = 0.125 microg/mL). Among other cephems, CZOP and CFIX were also strong (MIC90: 0.25 microg/mL). The antibacterial activity of the drugs to Pseudomonas aeruginosa was generally low, and MIC90 of all the drugs were ranged from 64 to > or = 256 microg/mL except IPM and amikacin (AMK) having 16 microg/mL. The antibacterial activity of CZOP was relatively good (MIC50: 8 microg/mL).
TI  - Newer carbapenems for urinary tract infections.
AB  - Four carbapenems have been available clinically in Japan. These are imipenem/cilastatin (IMIP/CS) and panipenem/ betamipron (PANI/BP) of the older compounds and newer carbapenems such as biapem (BIAP) and meropenem (MERO). The latter compounds are relatively stable to dehydropeptidase-1 (DHP-1) and have been reported to have higher antimicrobial activities compared to the earlier carbapenems. The antimicrobial activity of these four carbapenems against fresh urinary isolates showed high activities against Enterobacteriacae such as Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii and Escherichia coli containing the class C-beta-lactamase- and extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing strains compared to piperacillin (PIPC) and ceftazidime (CTAZ). Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the carbapenems, with the exception of panipenem showed strong antimicrobial activities compared to PIPC and CTAZ. High activities were also seen against Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, but methicillin-resistant strains were not affected. The first generation carbapenems showed better activity against E. faecalis than newer carbapenems. All four carbapenems were similar in clinical effectiveness in double blind trials for complicated urinary tract infections (UTIs). However, PANI/BP is less effective in UTIs caused by P. aeruginosa than IMIP/CS. MERO showed better eradication rate of P. aeruginosa than IMIP/CS. Retrospective analysis of treated cases using carbapenems showed a rapid defervescence in the treatment of febrile complicated UTIs, which were mainly caused by mixed infection of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, especially those involving P. aeruginosa and E. faecalis.
TI  - Bacterial resistance to antimicrobials in urinary isolates.
AB  - Escherichia coli accounted for about 80% of organisms in uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs), followed by Staphylococcus spp. especially Staphylococcus saprophyticus, and Proteus mirabilis. Against E. coli isolates from patients with uncomplicated UTI, faropenem was the most effective. Up to 1999, fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates were not observed in patients with uncomplicated UTI, but in 2001 fluoroquinolone-resistant E. coli isolates emerged and accounted for about 8%. Various types of organisms were isolated in patients with complicated UTI. Enterococcus faecalis, E. coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were the three most frequent organisms isolated. These three organisms accounted for 44.6%. Amongst oral agents, faropenem showed the lowest rate of resistance against E. coli followed by cephems. The rates of highly fluoroquinolone-resistant and cefpodoxime-resistant E. coli isolates increased rapidly from 1998 to 2001. Fluoroquinolone-resistant P. aeruginosa isolates accounted for about 40% in 2001. Against this species, amikacin was the most effective antimicrobials among all agents tested. About 17% of Pseudomonas were resistant to carbapenem. Eight milligram per litre of ampicillin inhibited all E. faecalis isolates; about 60% of Enterococcus faecium were resistant to ampicillin. The rates of levofloxacin-resistant isolates of E. faecalis and E. faecium were 38 and 97% respectively. UTIs caused by vancomycin resistant enterococci (VRE) are rare in Japan.
TI  - Gram-positive merA gene in gram-negative oral and urine bacteria.
AB  - Clinical mercury resistant (Hg(r)) Gram-negative bacteria carrying Gram-positive  mercury reductase (merA)-like genes were characterized using DNA-DNA hybridization, PCR and sequencing. A PCR assay was developed which discriminated between the merA genes related to Staphylococcus and those related to the Bacillus/Streptococcus merA genes by the difference in size of the PCR product. DNA sequence analysis correlated with the PCR assay. The merA genes from Acinetobacter junii, Enterobacter cloacae and Escherichia coli were sequenced and shared 98-99% identical nucleotide (nt) and 99.6-100% amino acid identity with the Staphylococcus aureus MerA protein. A fourth merA gene, from Pantoeae agglomerans, was partially sequenced (60%) and had 99% identical nt and 100% amino acid identity with the Streptococcus oralis MerA protein. All the Hg(r) Gram-negative bacteria transferred their Gram-positive merA genes to a Gram-positive Enterococcus faecalis recipient with the resulting transconjugants expressing mercury resistance. These Gram-positive merA genes join Gram-positive tetracycline resistance and Gram-positive macrolide resistance genes in their association with mobile elements which are able to transfer and express in Gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Bactericidal effect of different laser systems in the deep layers of dentin.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: In recent years, various laser systems have gained importance in the field of laser-assisted endodontics, namely the Nd:YAG, the diode, the Er:YAG, and the Er,Cr:YSGG laser. Individual studies have been carried out so far, focusing on the respective wavelength, its specific bactericidal capabilities, and potential usefulness is root-canal disinfection. The present in vitro investigation however, was performed to compare the microbicidal effect of these laser systems under standardized conditions and to draw a conclusion upon their relative effectiveness in the deep layers of dentin. STUDY DESIGN/MATERIALS AND METHODS: In total, 360 slices of root dentin with a thickness of 1 mm were obtained by longitudinal cuts of freshly extracted human premolars. The samples were steam sterilized and subsequently inoculated with a suspension of either Escherichia coli or Enterococcus faecalis. After the incubation, the samples were randomly assigned to the four different laser systems tested. Each laser group consisted of two different operational settings and a control. The dentinal samples underwent "indirect" laser irradiation through the dentin from the bacteria-free side and were then subjected to a classical quantitative microbiologic evaluation. To assess the temperature increase during the irradiation procedure, additional measurements were carried out using a thermocouple. RESULTS: Microbiology indicated that all laser systems were capable of significant reductions in both test strains. At an effective output power of 1 W, E. coli was reduced by at least three log steps in most of the samples by the tested wavelengths, with the best results for the Er:YAG laser showing complete eradication of E. coli in 75% of the samples. E. faecalis, a stubborn invader of the root canal, showed minor changes in bacterial count at 1 W. Using the higher setting of 1.5 W, significant reductions of E. coli were again observed with all laser systems, where only the diode and the Er:YAG laser were capable of complete eradication of E. faecalis to a significant extent. There was no significant relation between the temperature increase and the bactericidal effect. CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrates that all the wavelengths investigated are suitable for the disinfection of even the deeper layers of dentin and may prove to constitute valuable tools in state-of-the-art endodontics.
TI  - [An analysis of the strain homogeneity of parietal biotopes of the gastrointestinal tract].
AB  - The lumen and parietal biotopes of the human gastrointestinal tract were investigated, i.e. the antibiotic sensitivity of strains E. coli and Enterococcus faecalis residing in them were comparatively analyzed. Certain isolation degrees not only of the parietal and fecal biotopes but also of certain micro-regions in the intestine wall were detected. The obtained data confirm a previously made assumption on the cluster distribution of microorganisms in the parietal mucin. The distinct strain differences between the parietal and fecal biotopes are not enough to completely extrapolate the available characteristics of the lumen microflora on the parietal microbiocenose. The above stated underlines the necessity in purpose-oriented research of parietal microbe populations of "internal" biotopes.
TI  - [Clinical trial of aromatherapy on postpartum mother's perineal healing].
AB  - PURPOSE: This study was designed to verify the effect of aromatherapy on a postpartum mother's perineal healing. METHOD: The research design was a clinical trial. The methods of aromatherapy were applied sitz bath or soap application using essential oils with Lavender, Myrrh, Neroli, Rose, Grapefruit, Mandarin, Orange, and Roman Chamomile. The subjects of this experiment were postpartum mothers who delivered vaginally with an episiotomy. They were allocated to one of three groups; the aroma-sitz bath group, aroma-soap application group or control group. To evaluate the effect of aromatherapy, the perineal healing status was measured using the REEDA scale and smears of episiotomy wound were obtained. The data were analyzed by repeated measures of ANOVA, ANCOVA, chi2-test, and multiple response analysis via SPSS program. RESULT: The REEDA scale was significantly low in the experimental group at postpartum 5th and 7th days (P=.009, P=.003), respectively. Most were observed 'few'(5-10 bacteria per field) bacteria in the smears of episiotomy wound. The one bacteria was identified in the 50.8% of subjects in pretest and two bacteria in the 60.3% in posttest. Most frequently identified bacteria were Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, these findings indicate that postpartum aromatherapy for perineal care could be effective in healing the perineum perineal care could be effective in healing the perineum.
TI  - Nosocomial bloodstream infections in US hospitals: analysis of 24,179 cases from  a prospective nationwide surveillance study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nosocomial bloodstream infections (BSIs) are important causes of morbidity and mortality in the United States. METHODS: Data from a nationwide, concurrent surveillance study (Surveillance and Control of Pathogens of Epidemiological Importance [SCOPE]) were used to examine the secular trends in the epidemiology and microbiology of nosocomial BSIs. RESULTS: Our study detected 24,179 cases of nosocomial BSI in 49 US hospitals over a 7-year period from March 1995 through September 2002 (60 cases per 10,000 hospital admissions). Eighty-seven percent of BSIs were monomicrobial. Gram-positive organisms caused 65% of these BSIs, gram-negative organisms caused 25%, and fungi caused 9.5%. The crude mortality rate was 27%. The most-common organisms causing BSIs were coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) (31% of isolates), Staphylococcus aureus (20%), enterococci (9%), and Candida species (9%). The mean interval between admission and infection was 13 days for infection with Escherichia coli, 16 days for S. aureus, 22 days for Candida species and Klebsiella species, 23 days for enterococci, and 26 days for Acinetobacter species. CoNS, Pseudomonas species, Enterobacter species, Serratia species, and Acinetobacter species were more likely to cause infections in patients in intensive care units (P<.001). In neutropenic patients, infections with Candida species, enterococci, and viridans group streptococci were significantly more common. The proportion of S. aureus isolates with methicillin resistance increased from 22% in 1995 to 57% in 2001 (P<.001, trend analysis). Vancomycin resistance was seen in 2% of Enterococcus faecalis isolates and in 60% of Enterococcus faecium isolates. CONCLUSION: In this study, one of the largest multicenter studies performed to date, we found that the proportion of nosocomial BSIs due to antibiotic-resistant organisms is increasing in US hospitals.
TI  - Urinary concentrations and bactericidal activities of newer fluoroquinolones in healthy volunteers.
AB  - Eleven healthy male subjects participated in a crossover study to compare the urine concentrations and bactericidal activities of newer fluoroquinolones against common uropathogens. Each volunteer received a single oral dose of gatifloxacin (400 mg), levofloxacin (250 mg), moxifloxacin (400 mg) and trovafloxacin (200 mg), and a urine sample was obtained at 2, 6, 12 and 24 h after the dose. Urine concentrations were highest with gatifloxacin and levofloxacin and lowest with trovafloxacin. Each drug concentration was studied against a levofloxacin susceptible and moderately-susceptible strain of Escherichia coli (minimal inhibitory concentration, MICs: 0.125 and 4 mg/l), K. pneumoniae (MICs: 0.125 and 4 mg/l), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MICs: 0.5 and 4 mg/l) and Enterococcus faecalis (MICs: 0.25 and 4 mg/l). The duration of urine bactericidal activity (UBA) was based upon the median bactericidal titre at each time period. Both gatifloxacin and levofloxacin exhibited prolonged (> or = 6 h) UBA against all of the study isolates. Moxifloxacin exhibited prolonged UBA against both isolates of E. coli, K. pneumoniae and E. faecalis but not against either strain of P. aeruginosa. Prolonged UBA was not observed for trovafloxacin against the moderately-susceptible strains with the exception of E. faecalis. Furthermore, UBA was not observed for trovafloxacin against the susceptible strain of P. aeruginosa. Although these newer fluoroquinolones exhibited similar in vitro activity against these uropathogens, only those compounds with the highest urinary concentrations (gatifloxacin and levofloxacin) produced prolonged UBA against both strains of P. aeruginosa. The findings from this study suggest that both microbiological activity and urinary concentrations are important parameters to consider when choosing a fluoroquinolone for empirical treatment of urinary tract infections (UTIs).
TI  - Emerging resistance among bacterial pathogens in the intensive care unit--a European and North American Surveillance study (2000-2002).
AB  - BACKGROUND: Globally ICUs are encountering emergence and spread of antibiotic-resistant pathogens and for some pathogens there are few therapeutic options available. METHODS: Antibiotic in vitro susceptibility data of predominant ICU pathogens during 2000-2 were analyzed using data from The Surveillance Network (TSN) Databases in Europe (France, Germany and Italy), Canada, and the United States (US). RESULTS: Oxacillin resistance rates among Staphylococcus aureus isolates ranged from 19.7% to 59.4%. Penicillin resistance rates among Streptococcus pneumoniae varied from 2.0% in Germany to as high as 20.2% in the US; however, ceftriaxone resistance rates were comparably lower, ranging from 0% in Germany to 3.4% in Italy. Vancomycin resistance rates among Enterococcus faecalis were < or = 4.5%; however, among Enterococcus faecium vancomycin resistance rates were more frequent ranging from 0.8% in France to 76.3% in the United States. Putative rates of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) production among Enterobacteriaceae were low, <6% among Escherichia coli in the five countries studied. Ceftriaxone resistance rates were generally lower than or similar to piperacillin-tazobactam for most of the Enterobacteriaceae species examined. Fluoroquinolone resistance rates were generally higher for E. coli (6.5% - 13.9%), Proteus mirabilis (0-34.7%), and Morganella morganii (1.6-20.7%) than other Enterobacteriaceae spp (1.5-21.3%). P. aeruginosa demonstrated marked variation in beta-lactam resistance rates among countries. Imipenem was the most active compound tested against Acinetobacter spp., based on resistance rates. CONCLUSION: There was a wide distribution in resistance patterns among the five countries. Compared with other countries, Italy showed the highest resistance rates to all the organisms with the exception of Enterococcus spp., which were highest in the US. This data highlights the differences in resistance encountered in intensive care units in Europe and North America and the need to determine current local resistance patterns by which to guide empiric antimicrobial therapy for intensive care infections.
TI  - Domain-domain interactions in the aminoglycoside antibiotic resistance enzyme AAC(6')-APH(2'').
AB  - The most common determinant of aminoglycoside antibiotic resistance in Gram positive bacterial pathogens, such as Staphylococcus aureus, is a modifying enzyme, AAC(6')-APH(2' '), capable of acetylating and phosphorylating a wide range of antibiotics. This enzyme is unique in that it is composed of two separable modification domains, and although a number of studies have been conducted on the acetyltransferase and phosphotransferase activities in isolation, little is known about the role and impact of domain interactions on antibiotic resistance. Kinetic analysis and in vivo assessment of a number of N- and C-terminal truncated proteins have demonstrated that the two domains operate independently and do not accentuate one another's resistance activity. However, the two domains are structurally integrated, and mutational analysis has demonstrated that a predicted connecting alpha-helix is especially critical for maintaining proper structure and function of both activities. AAC(6')-APH(2' ') detoxifies a staggering array of aminoglycosides, where one or both activities make important contributions depending on the antibiotic. Thus, to overcome antibiotic resistance associated with AAC(6')-APH(2' '), aminoglycosides resistant to modification and/or inhibitors against both activities must be employed. Domain-domain interactions in AAC(6')-APH(2' ') offer a unique target for inhibitor strategies, as we show that their disruption simultaneously inhibits both activities >90%.
TI  - [Pyogenic liver abscess in chronic alcoholic pancreatitis].
AB  - HISTORY AND ADMISSION FINDINGS: A 44-year-old patient was transferred for further treatment of pyogenic liver abscess and a severe attack of a chronic pancreatitis for strong upper right quadrant abdominal pain and recurring fever. INVESTIGATIONS: Laboratory results revealed a significant inflammatory constellation. Abdominal ultrasound was performed which showed a big pyogenic abscess in the right lobe of the liver. Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis could be isolated from abscess aspirates. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERC) without access of the pancreatic duct showed stenosis of the Ductus hepatocholedochus which was treated with a biliary endoprothesis. DIAGNOSIS, TREATMENT AND COURSE: Antibiotic treatment and percutaneous drainage led to complete remission of the abscess. A few days after discharge the patient returned with identical clinical symptoms. Abdominal ultrasound showed recurrence of the abscess. Because of excessively high pancreatic amylase in aspirated abscess material the patient underwent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreaticography (ERCP). There, a pancreatico-hepatic fistula was seen, probably the result of necrosis caused by a severe acute attack of the chronic pancreatitis. After insertion of a naso-fistular drainage, continous rinse and appropriate antibiotic therapy both abscess and fistula completely disappeared without recurrence. CONCLUSION: The rare case of a pancreatic fistula should be considered when a pyogenic liver abscess follows an episode of acute pancreatitis or attack of chronic pancreatitis. Determination of pancreatic amylase in aspired abscess material can be an important step towards correct diagnosis.
TI  - Influence of growth conditions on the production of a bacteriocin by Lactococcus  lactis subsp. lactis ST34BR, a strain isolated from barley beer.
AB  - Bacteriocin ST34BR, a small polypeptide of 2.9 kDa produced by Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis ST34BR, inhibits the growth of Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus casei, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. MRS broth, adjusted to pH 6.0 yielded 6,400 AU/ml, compared to 400 AU/ml recorded in BHI broth, M17 broth, 10% (w/v) soy milk, and 8% and 10% (w/v) molasses. At pH of 4.5 only 800 AU/ml was produced. Based on comparative studies in MRS broth, without organic nitrogen, supplemented with different combinations of tryptone, meat extract and yeast extract, tryptone was identified as the stimulating nitrogen compound. Growth in the presence of 20 g/l glucose, maltose, mannose or sucrose yielded bacteriocin levels of 6,400 AU/ml, whereas the same concentration of lactose and fructose yielded 3,200 AU/ml and 1,600 AU/ml, respectively. No difference in bacteriocin ST34BR activity was recorded in MRS broth supplemented with 2 g/l K2HPO4 and 2 g/l, 5 g/l, 10 g/l or 50 g/l KH2PO4. However, 20 g/l KH2PO4 increased bacteriocin ST34BR production to 12,800 AU/ml. Glycerol at 1g/l to 10 g/l in MRS broth reduced bacteriocin activity to 3,200 AU/ml, whilst 20 g/l and 50 g/l yielded only 1,600 AU/ml. The presence of cyanocobalamin, L-ascorbic acid, thiamine and DL-6,8-thioctic acid in MRS broth at 1.0 ppm, respectively, did not result in increased activity levels.
TI  - Evaluation of the Hyplex BloodScreen Multiplex PCR-Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system for direct identification of gram-positive cocci and gram-negative bacilli from positive blood cultures.
AB  - We evaluated the Hyplex BloodScreen PCR-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) system (BAG, Lich, Germany), a new diagnostic test for the direct identification of gram-negative bacilli and gram-positive cocci from positive blood cultures, with 482 positive BACTEC 9240 blood culture bottles. The test involves amplification of the bacterial DNA by multiplex PCR and subsequent hybridization of the PCR product to specific oligonucleotide probes in an ELISA-based format. The available probes allow the separate detection of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis/Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus pneumoniae and the staphylococcal mecA gene. The Hyplex BloodScreen test showed an overall sensitivity of 100% for the identification of gram-negative bacilli and 96.6 to 100% for the identification of gram-positive cocci (S. aureus, 100%; S. epidermidis, 97.2%; Enterococcus faecalis/Enterococcus faecium, 96.6%; and Streptococcus pneumoniae, 100%). The specificities of the test modules ranged from 92.5 to 100% for gram-negative bacilli and 97.7 to 100% for gram-positive cocci (Escherichia coli, 92.5%; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 98.5%; Klebsiella spp., 100%; Enterobacter aerogenes, 100%; S. aureus, 100%, S. epidermidis, 97.7%; Enterococcus faecalis/Enterococcus faecium, 99.6%; Streptococcus pyogenes, 100%; and Streptococcus pneumoniae, 99.3%). The result of the mecA gene detection module correlated with the result of the phenotypic oxacillin resistance testing in all 38 isolates of Staphylococcus aureus investigated. In conclusion, the Hyplex BloodScreen PCR-ELISA system is well suited for the direct and specific identification of the most common pathogenic bacteria and the direct detection of the mecA gene of Staphylococcus aureus in positive blood cultures.
TI  - Prevalence and characterization of integrons in blood culture Enterobacteriaceae  and gastrointestinal Escherichia coli in Norway and reporting of a novel class 1 integron-located lincosamide resistance gene.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Class 1 integrons contain genetic elements for site-specific recombination, capture and mobilization of resistance genes. Studies investigating the prevalence, distribution and types of integron located resistance genes are important for surveillance of antimicrobial resistance and to understand resistance development at the molecular level. METHODS: We determined the prevalence and genetic content of class 1 integrons in Enterobacteriaceae (strain collection 1, n = 192) and E. coli (strain collection 2, n = 53) from bloodstream infections in patients from six Norwegian hospitals by molecular techniques. Class 1 integrons were also characterized in 54 randomly selected multiresistant E. coli isolates from gastrointestinal human infections (strain collection 3). RESULTS: Class 1 integrons were present in 10.9% of the Enterobacteriaceae blood culture isolates of collection 1, all but one (S. Typhi) being E. coli. Data indicated variations in class 1 integron prevalence between hospitals. Class 1 integrons were present in 37% and 34% of the resistant blood culture isolates (collection 1 and 2, respectively) and in 42% of the resistant gastrointestinal E. coli. We detected a total of 10 distinct integron cassette PCR amplicons that varied in size between 0.15 kb and 2.2 kb and contained between zero and three resistance genes. Cassettes encoding resistance to trimethoprim and aminoglycosides were most common. We identified and characterized a novel plasmid-located integron with a cassette-bound novel gene (linF) located downstream of an aadA2 gene cassette. The linF gene encoded a putative 273 aa lincosamide nucleotidyltransferase resistance protein and conferred resistance to lincomycin and clindamycin. The deduced LinF amino acid sequence displayed approximately 35% identity to the Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis nucleotidyl transferases encoded by linB and linB' CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrated an overall low and stable prevalence of class 1 integron gene cassettes in clinical Enterobacteriaceae and E. coli isolates in Norway. Characterization of the novel lincosamide resistance gene extends the growing list of class 1 integron gene cassettes that confer resistance to an increasing number of antibiotics.
TI  - [Fournier's gangrene: report of 4 cases].
AB  - Fournier's gangrene is an infective necrotizing fasciitis of the perineal, genital or perianal region. We treated four cases of Fournier's gangrene from July 2002 to April 2003. All patients were male, ranging in age from 73-92 years old (80.5 +/- 6.5). They were admitted to our hospital complaining of perineal pain, scrotal swelling and high fever. Immediately, we started systemic chemotherapy with broad-spectrum antibiotics, and performed surgical debridements for all patients. Three patients made a full recovery, but one patient died of sepsis. These cases are presented with some notes on the relevant literature.
TI  - Antimicrobial potential of immobilized Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis ATCC 11454 against selected bacteria.
AB  - Immobilization of living cells of lactic acid bacteria could be an alternative or complementary method of immobilizing organic acids and bacteriocins and inhibit undesirable bacteria in foods. This study evaluated the inhibition potential of immobilized Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis ATCC 11454 on selected bacteria by a modified method of the agar spot test. L. lactis was immobilized in calcium alginate (1 to 2%)-whey protein concentrate (0 and 1%) beads. The antimicrobial potential of immobilized L. lactis was evaluated in microbiological media against pathogenic bacteria (Escherichia coli, Salmonella, and Staphylococcus aureus) or Pseudomonas putida, a natural meat contaminant, and against seven gram-positive bacteria used as indicator strains. Results obtained in this study indicated that immobilized L. lactis inhibited the growth of S. aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus curvatus, Lactobacillus sakei, Kocuria varians, and Pediococcus acidilactici. Only 4 h of incubation at 35 degrees C resulted in a clear inhibition zone around the beads that increased with time. With the addition of 10 mM of a chelating agent (EDTA) to the media, results showed growth inhibition of E. coli; however, P. putida and Salmonella Typhi were unaffected by this treatment. These results indicate that immobilized lactic acid bacteria strains can be successfully used to produce nisin and inhibit bacterial growth in semisolid synthetic media.
TI  - Results of a multicenter, randomized, open-label efficacy and safety study of two doses of tigecycline for complicated skin and skin-structure infections in hospitalized patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Tigecycline is a broad-spectrum glycylcycline antibiotic being investigated for the treatment of serious infections in hospitalized patients. Tigecycline has been shown to be efficacious against serious infections in animals, and preliminary studies in healthy adults have shown that tigecycline has an acceptable tolerability profile. OBJECTIVE: This study compared the clinical and microbiological efficacy, pharmacokinetic properties, and tolerability of 2 doses of tigecycline in hospitalized patients with a complicated skin and skin-structure infection (cSSSI). METHODS: This Phase II, randomized, open-label study was conducted between September 1999 and March 2001 at 14 investigative centers across the United States. Patients were randomized to receive tigecycline 25 or 50 mg IV q12h for 7 to 14 days. The primary efficacy end point was the clinically observed cure rate among clinically evaluable (CE) patients at the test-of-cure visit. Secondary end points were the clinical cure rate at the end of treatment and bacteriologic response in microbiologically evaluable (ME) patients. Also, in vitro tests of susceptibility to tigecycline were performed for selected pathogens known to cause skin infections, including methicillin-resistant and methicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, and Enterococcus faecium. Tolerability assessments also were conducted. RESULTS: A total of 160 patients received > or =1 dose of tigecycline; 109 patients were CE, and 91 were ME. The majority of patients (74%) were men, and the mean (SD) age was 49.0 (14.8) years. At the test-of-cure visit, the clinical cure rate in the 25-mg group was 67% (95% CI, 53.3%-79.3%) and in the 50-mg group was 74% (95% CI, 60.3%-85.0%). In the 25-mg group, 56% of the patients had eradication (95% CI, 40.0%-70.4%) of the pathogens compared with 69% (95% CI, 54.2%-82.3%) in the 50-mg group. Values for the minimum concentration of tigecycline that is inhibitory for 90% of all isolates ranged from 0.06 to 0.50 microg/mL for the selected pathogens. Both tigecycline doses were generally well tolerated. Nausea and vomiting were the most common adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, tigecycline appeared efficacious and showed a favorable pharmacokinetic profile and an acceptable safety profile in the treatment of hospitalized patients with cSSSI. In patients who received 50-mg doses of tigecycline q12h, the clinical cure rates and microbial eradication rates were 74% and 70%, respectively, and were 67% and 56% in patients who received 25-mg doses.
TI  - Relationship between antibacterial activity of chitosan and surface characteristics of cell wall.
AB  - AIM: Five representative waterborne pathogens were used to illustrate the relationship between chitosan's antibacterial activity and the surface characteristics of the bacterial cell wall. METHODS: Chitosan was prepared with averaged 75% or 95% deacetylated degree to examine its antibacterial activity against waterborne pathogens. Fresh microbial inoculants for the antibacterial assessment were prepared on nutrient agar at 37 degrees for 24 h. The evaluation items of antibacterial mechanism included hydrophilicity and negative charge analysis of cell surface, and adsorptive characteristics of chitosan to bacterial cell. All the experiments were applied in triplicate tests at least. RESULTS: Although cell wall hydrophilicity was similar among Gram-negative bacteria, the distribution of negative charge on their cell surfaces was quite different. More negatively charged cell surfaces had a greater interaction with chitosan, a phenomenon further confirmed by transmission electron micrography (TEM). CONCLUSION: Results showed the hydrophilicity in Gram-negative bacteria was much higher than in Gram-positive ones. The correlation coefficient 0.988 between the amount of absorbed chitosan and its inhibition efficiency indicated a close relationship.
TI  - Biochemical characterization of Bacillus subtilis type II isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase, and phylogenetic distribution of isoprenoid biosynthesis pathways.
AB  - An open reading frame (Acc. no. P50740) on the Bacillus subtilis chromosome extending from bp 184,997-186,043 with similarity to the idi-2 gene of Streptomyces sp. CL190 specifying type II isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase was expressed in a recombinant Escherichia coli strain. The recombinant protein with a subunit mass of 39 kDa was purified to apparent homogeneity by column chromatography. The protein was shown to catalyse the conversion of dimethylallyl diphosphate into isopentenyl diphosphate and vice versa at rates of 0.23 and 0.63 micromol.mg(-1).min(-1), respectively, as diagnosed by 1H spectroscopy. FMN and divalent cations are required for catalytic activity; the highest rates were found with Ca2+. NADPH is required under aerobic but not under anaerobic assay conditions. The enzyme is related to a widespread family of (S)-alpha-hydroxyacid oxidizing enzymes including flavocytochrome b2 and L-lactate dehydrogenase and was shown to catalyse the formation of [2,3-13C2]lactate from [2,3-13C2]pyruvate, albeit at a low rate of 1 nmol.mg(-1).min(-1). Putative genes specifying type II isopentenyl diphosphate isomerases were found in the genomes of Archaea and of certain eubacteria but not in the genomes of fungi, animals and plants. The analysis of the occurrence of idi-1 and idi-2 genes in conjunction with the mevalonate and nonmevalonate pathway in 283 completed and unfinished prokaryotic genomes revealed 10 different classes. Type II isomerase is essential in some important human pathogens including Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis where it may represent a novel target for anti-infective therapy.
TI  - The ponA gene of Enterococcus faecalis JH2-2 codes for a low-affinity class A penicillin-binding protein.
AB  - A soluble derivative of the Enterococcus faecalis JH2-2 class A PBP1 (*PBP1) was  overproduced and purified. It exhibited a glycosyltransferase activity on the Escherichia coli 14C-labeled lipid II precursor. As a DD- peptidase, it could hydrolyze thiolester substrates with efficiencies similar to those of other class A penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) and bind beta-lactams, but with k2/K (a parameter accounting for the acylation step efficiency) values characteristic of penicillin-resistant PBPs.
TI  - Functional replacement of the FabA and FabB proteins of Escherichia coli fatty acid synthesis by Enterococcus faecalis FabZ and FabF homologues.
AB  - The anaerobic unsaturated fatty acid synthetic pathway of Escherichia coli requires two specialized proteins, FabA and FabB. However, the fabA and fabB genes are found only in the Gram-negative alpha- and gamma-proteobacteria, and thus other anaerobic bacteria must synthesize these acids using different enzymes. We report that the Gram-positive bacterium Enterococcus faecalis encodes a protein, annotated as FabZ1, that functionally replaces the E. coli FabA protein, although the sequence of this protein aligns much more closely with E. coli FabZ, a protein that plays no specific role in unsaturated fatty acid synthesis. Therefore E. faecalis FabZ1 is a bifunctional dehydratase/isomerase, an enzyme activity heretofore confined to a group of Gram-negative bacteria. The FabZ2 protein is unable to replace the function of E. coli FabZ, although FabZ2, a second E. faecalis FabZ homologue, has this ability. Moreover, an E. faecalis FabF homologue (FabF1) was found to replace the function of E. coli FabB, whereas a second FabF homologue was inactive. From these data it is clear that bacterial fatty acid biosynthetic pathways cannot be deduced solely by sequence comparisons.
TI  - [Effect of urinary tract infections in children with chronic renal failure on peritoneal dialysis].
AB  - Urinary tract infections (UTI) in children on dialysis treatment are regarded as  indirect contraindication for kidney transplantation. In medication of UTI it is recommended to prescribe antibacterial agent in proper dosage (often in reduced amount) and to choose desired drug in selected period of chronic renal failure (CRF). THE AIM: of the study was the evaluation of UTI incidence in children and adolescents with terminal renal failure on peritoneal dialysis treatment (PD), kind of isolated bacterial strains and their current drug-sensitivity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 26 children and young adults (15 girls and 11 boys) on PD for the period longer than 6 months (mean 2.0+/-1.5 years). The mean age of examined children was 13.2+/-4.4 years. Total number of 57 culture-positive UTI episodes were recorded (30 in girls, 27 in boys)--1-episode/11.1 patient-month. In examined group UTI most frequently were present in children with uncorrected urinary tract malformation (1 episode/7.7 patient-month) and in children on immunosuppressive treatment (1 episode/5.7 patient-month). In children with cystic kidney disease infections had accidental character. CONCLUSIONS: The most frequent occurring pathogen was bacteria Escherichia coli--13 (22.8%) and Streptococcus faecalis--13 (22.8%) infections. E. coli strains shown sensitivity to second generation of quinolones: ciprofloxacin; third generation of cephalosporin: ceftazidime; partial sensitivity to amoxicillin with clavulanic acid, aminoglycosides. Streptococcus faecalis strains revealed only partial sensitivity to nitrofurantoin, vancomycin, teicoplanin.
TI  - Antimicrobial activities of eucalyptus leaf extracts and flavonoids from Eucalyptus maculata.
AB  - AIMS: We investigated the antimicrobial activities of eucalyptus leaf extracts to find effective antibacterial agents. METHODS AND RESULTS: The antimicrobial activities of leaf extracts from 26 species of eucalyptus were measured. Extracts of Eucalyptus globulus, E. maculata and E. viminalis significantly inhibited the growth of six Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, MRSA, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, Alicyclobacillus acidoterrestris, Propionibacterium acnes), and of a fungus (Trichophyton mentagrophytes), but they did not show strong antibacterial activity against Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas putida). 2',6'-dihydroxy-3'-methyl-4'-methoxy-dihydrochalcone, eucalyptin and 8-desmethyl-eucalyptin, isolated from E. maculata extracts, exhibited potent antimicrobial activities against seven micro-organisms with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) ranging from 1.0 to 31 mg l(-1). CONCLUSIONS: The eucalyptus extracts and three compounds from E. maculata were found to be effective against micro-organisms that cause food poisoning, acne and athlete's foot. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study shows potential uses of extracts from E. globulus, E. maculata and E. viminalis, and antimicrobial compounds isolated from E. maculata.
TI  - [Search of promising strains of bifidobacteria and lactobacillus for the development of new biopreparations].
AB  - For the first time the species composition of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli in  clinically healthy young children has been studied. As revealed in this study, the dominating species of bifidobacteria are B. longum, B. adolescentis and B. infantis, while the dominating species of lactobacilli are Lactobacillus acidophilus and L. rhamnosus. In 83 isolated cultures of bifidobacteria and 34 isolated species of lactobacilli the activity of acid formation and the antagonistic activity with respect to Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Clostridium perfringens have been tested. B. longum strain 58B, B. infantis strain 37B, L. rhamnosus strain 12L and L. acidophilus strain 27L, typical for children of this age group, having good antagonistic activity and pronounced acid-forming properties, have been selected. These strains hold good promise to be used as the basis for the development of a complex probiotic preparation for correcting intestinal microflora in young children.
TI  - Traditional medicine in north Cote-d'Ivoire: screening of 50 medicinal plants for antibacterial activity.
AB  - Sixty-seven crude ethanol extracts from 50 plants (31 families), which are used in North Cote-d'Ivoire as traditional remedies for bacterial diseases, were screened for in vitro activity against Gram negative (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and Gram positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes and Bacillus subtilis) bacteria. Thirty-one extracts showed antibacterial activity only on Gram positive bacteria. Of these, 10 extracts from 10 plant species had a promising level of activity against bacteria including strains resistant to antibiotics such as aminosides, penicillin M, macrolides, lincosamide and streptrogramin B. The most active was Erythrina senegalensis DC (Fabaceae) followed by Bobgunnia madagascariensis (Desv.) J.H. Kirkbr. & Wiersema (Caesalpinaceae), Waltheria lanceolata R. Br. ex Mast. (Sterculiaceae), Uapaca togoensis Pax. (Euphorbiaceae), Ximenia americana L. (Olacaceae), Khaya senegalensis (Ders.) A. Juss. (Meliaceae), Lannea acida A. Rich. (Anacardiaceae), Cissus populnea Guill. & Perr. (Vitaceae), Keetia hispida (Benth.) Bridson (Rubiaceae) and Ficus thonningii (Miq.) A. Rich. (Moraceae). This is the first report of the antibacterial potency of these 10 plant species on a range of bacteria. The results provided evidence that some of the studied plants might indeed be potential sources of new antibacterial agents, also against some antibiotic-resistant strains.
TI  - [Bact-Alert automatized system for blood cultures: 5 vs 7 days of incubation. First Argentine multicentre study].
AB  - Bact-Alert automatized system for blood cultures: 5 vs 7 days of incubation. First Argentine multicentre study. Between January and December 2001, we analyzed 80,141 blood cultures by the Bact-Alert system (14,960 FAN aerobics, 3,855 FAN anaerobic, 11,114 standards aerobics, 11,367 standards anaerobic, 12,054 pediatrics and 26,791 FAN pediatrics bottles) and 44.235 series from 27.615 patients at eight hospitals of Buenos Aires city, one of La Plata city and three of the Buenos Aires province. A total of 13,657 blood cultures yielded a positive result. Only 181 of them had been detected as positive between the 5th and 7th day of incubation and only 26 (0.19%) had clinical significance (Staphylococcus aureus 3; coagulase negative staphylococci 2; Enterococcus faecalis 1; Streptococcus pneumoniae 2; Campylobacter spp 1; Escherichia coli 1; Enterobacter cloacae 1; Enterobacteraerogenes 1; Citrobacter freundii 1; Klebsiella pneumoniae 1; Proteus mirabilis 1; Serratia marcescens 4; yeasts 7, including one strain of Cryptococcus neoformans). Of the total of contaminants, 38% were isolated by the anaerobic standard (65% were Propionibacterium spp and 29% coagulase negative staphylococci), 31.2% by the FAN aerobic (33.3% difphteroids and 28.9% Bacillus spp), 11.8% by the pediatric, 9% by FAN pediatric, 8.33% by aerobic standard and 1.4% by FAN anaerobic bottle. Our results show that the prolonged incubation of blood cultures for more than 5 days using the Bact-Alert system is unnecessary.
TI  - A study of female urinary tract infection caused by urodynamic investigation.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence of female urinary tract infection before and after urodynamic investigation and to identify the risk factors for urinary tract infection after urodynamic investigation. STUDY DESIGN: Eight hundred twenty-two consecutive incontinent women were recruited. All women were "double-screened" and treated for urinary tract infection before urodynamic investigation: first by mid stream urine culture 4 to 6 weeks before investigation and then by reagent strips for urine leukocytes and nitrites at the time of investigation. The investigation was postponed until the urinary tract infection had been treated. All women then received a standard urodynamic investigation. RESULTS: The prevalence of urinary tract infection before urodynamic investigation was 5.1% (95% CI, 3.6-6.6), and the prevalence after the investigation was 8.4% (95% CI, 6.5-10.3). Three independent risk factors were identified: age >or=70 years (odds ratio, 1.99; 95% CI, 1.14-3.48), previous continence surgery (odds ratio, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.05-3.43), and urinary tract infection before urodynamic investigation (odds ratio, 3.13; 95% CI, 1.43-6.83). The 3 most common uropathogens in the urinary tract infections after the urodynamic investigation were Escherichia coli (46.3%), Enterococcus spp (16.4%), and Enterococcus faecalis (11.9%). CONCLUSION: Despite a stringent screen-and-treat protocol before urodynamic investigation, patients still experienced urinary tract infection.
TI  - The effects of chlorhexidine gluconate (0.12%) on the antimicrobial properties of tooth-colored ProRoot mineral trioxide aggregate.
AB  - The purpose of this in vitro study was to determine whether the substitution of 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate for sterile water as a mixing agent would enhance the antimicrobial activity of tooth-colored ProRoot mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) against Actinomyces odontolyticus (ATCC17982), Fusobacterium nucleatum (ATCC2586), Streptococcus sanguis (ATCC10556), Enterococcus faecalis (ER3/2S), Escherichia coli (SM10lambdapir), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC6538), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (UME), and Candida albicans (ATCC10261). Two wells of 5-mm diameter were made in triplicate agar plates inoculated with standardized suspensions of each microorganism. MTA (33 mg) mixed with chlorhexidine (12 microl) or sterile water (12 microl) was placed to fill each well. Plates were incubated at 37 degrees C as required for microbial growth. A blinded, independent observer measured zones of inhibition. All MTA samples inhibited microbial growth regardless of mixing agent. MTA/chlorhexidine showed significantly larger zones of inhibition (p < 0.0002, paired t test). In conclusion, substituting 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate for water enhanced the antimicrobial activity of tooth-colored ProRoot MTA.
TI  - Chemometric studies on the bactericidal activity of quinolones via an extended VolSurf approach.
AB  - An extended VolSurf approach, that additionally includes SHAPE descriptors, was applied to a dataset of 55 quinolones. Bactericidal activity was measured at Bayer AG, Germany, for Gram-negative (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis). Chemometric analysis was first approached via a classical VolSurf approach. The following descriptors were found most important: bactericidal activity particularly increases with high values of the best volume (BV11(OH2)) and the minimum energy (Emin1(OH2)) of the water probe, high values of the integy moment (ID(DRY)) of the lipophilic probe, and high values of the hydrophilic region (W(O)) of the hydrogen bond acceptor probe. Best volume (BV31(OH2)) of the water probe and best volume (BV12(DRY)) and lipophilic regions (D(DRY)) of the lipophilic probe as well as H-bonding capacity derived with the CO probe (HB(O)) are inversely related to activity. PLS analysis yields a five-component model with an r(2) of 0.83 and a q(2) of 0.43 after variable selection via fractional factorial design (FFD). Chemometric modeling could be improved by including newly derived SHAPE descriptors, which were merged with the VolSurf descriptors and subjected to PLS analysis. The global model of this extended VolSurf approach is optimal with two components and exhibits a significantly improved statistical quality; a marginally reduced r(2) (0.75 versus 0.83) is more than compensated by a highly improved predictivity with a q(2) of 0.63 versus 0.43. To prove model quality, external prediction of seven test set quinolones was performed. The precise prediction of all test set molecules nicely demonstrates the robustness and statistical significance of the obtained chemometric model using the extended VolSurf approach.
TI  - Sensitization of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria to jenseniin G by sublethal injury.
AB  - Jenseniin G, a bacteriocin produced by Propionibacterium thoenii P126, is active  against related propionibacteria and some lactic acid bacteria and is sporostatic to botulinal spores. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of sublethal stress on jenseniin G activity. Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella Typhimurium, Shigella flexneri, Staphylococcus aureus, and Yersinia enterocolitica were subjected to temperature, acid, and osmotic stresses in the presence of jenseniin G. The bacteriocin reduced the viability of sublethally injured cultures, although the extent of reduction varied with strain and treatment. E. faecalis was the most sensitive to temperature stress; no reduction of viable counts occurred in the absence of jenseniin G, and a 1.5-log reduction occurred in the presence of jenseniin G. B. cereus, L. monocytogenes, and S. aureus were more sensitive to jenseniin G when exposed to heat stress than when exposed to cold stress, whereas E. coli, Salmonella Typhimurium, and S. flexneri were more sensitive to jenseniin G when exposed to cold stress than when exposed to heat stress. When comparing an acid stress test alone to a combination of acid stress and jenseniin G, E. faecalis and L. monocytogenes showed the greatest sensitivities with 4.87- and 2.82-log reductions, respectively, after 7 days. All cultures except for S. aureus were adversely affected by the combination of salt stress and jenseniin G. Salmonella Typhimurium showed the greatest sensitivity to salt stress with jenseniin G (a 1.54-log reduction at day 7) when compared to salt stress alone (a 0.55-log reduction at day 7). Jenseniin G, like bacteriocins produced by other gram-positive species, has broader activity against stressed organisms.
TI  - Transcriptional analysis of the groE and dnaK heat-shock operons of Enterococcus  faecalis.
AB  - Enterococcus faecalis is able to survive in extremely adverse conditions, and its ability to resist stress is considered a key virulence attribute. Here, we conducted a detailed transcriptional analysis of the groE and dnaK operons of E. faecalis. The dnaK operon is comprised of four genes (hrcA-grpE-dnaK-dnaJ) preceded by two conserved CIRCE sequences. The dnaK operon is expressed from a sigmaA-type promoter located upstream of hrcA and multiple transcripts are detectable, possibly due to mRNA processing. The groE operon (groES-groEL) is transcribed as a single mRNA from a sigmaA-type promoter located immediately upstream of a CIRCE element. Induction of dnaK and groEL occurs in response to heat shock and exposure to NaCl, SDS and H(2)O(2).
TI  - Antibiotic resistance among fecal indicator bacteria from healthy individually owned and kennel dogs.
AB  - Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis strains isolated from anal swabs of clinically healthy dogs were examined for the presence of acquired antimicrobial resistance. The strains originated from dogs of 92 different owners and from eight breeding kennels. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the resistance situation in the intestinal flora of the dog to assess the possible role of the dog flora as a reservoir of antimicrobial resistance. Multiple resistance was rarely found in E. coli strains collected from individually owned dogs, in contrast with strains from kennel dogs. Resistance to ampicillin, trimethoprim, and sulfamethoxazole was significantly less prevalent in E. coli from privately owned dogs than in strains from kennel dogs. Resistance rates against tetracycline and macrolides were unexpectedly high in E. faecalis strains. Two and three E. faecalis strains from individually owned dogs and kennel dogs, respectively, were resistant to gentamicin, an antibiotic often used for treating enterococcal infections in humans. This study demonstrates that resistance percentages may fluctuate with the choice of dog population. The observed antimicrobial resistance percentages indicate that the flora of healthy dogs may act as a reservoir of resistance genes.
TI  - Prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from blood cultures of hospitalized patients in the United States in 2002.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bloodstream infections are associated with significant patient morbidity and mortality. Antimicrobial susceptibility patterns should guide the choice of empiric antimicrobial regimens for patients with bacteremia. METHODS: From January to December of 2002, 82,569 bacterial blood culture isolates were reported to The Surveillance Network (TSN) Database-USA by 268 laboratories. Susceptibility to relevant antibiotic compounds was analyzed using National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards guidelines. RESULTS: Coagulase-negative staphylococci (42.0%), Staphylococcus aureus (16.5%), Enterococcus faecalis (8.3%), Escherichia coli (7.2%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (3.6%), and Enterococcus faecium (3.5%) were the most frequently isolated bacteria from blood cultures, collectively accounting for >80% of isolates. In vitro susceptibility to expanded-spectrum beta-lactams such as ceftriaxone were high for oxacillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci (98.7%), oxacillin-susceptible S. aureus (99.8%), E. coli (97.3%), K. pneumoniae (93.3%), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (97.2%). Susceptibilities to fluoroquinolones were variable for K. pneumoniae (90.3-91.4%), E. coli (86.0-86.7%), oxacillin-susceptible S. aureus (84.0-89.4%), oxacillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci (72.7-82.7%), E. faecalis (52.1%), and E. faecium (11.3%). Combinations of antimicrobials are often prescribed as empiric therapy for bacteremia. Susceptibilities of all blood culture isolates to one or both agents in combinations of ceftriaxone, ceftazdime, cefepime, piperacillin-tazobactam or ciprofloxacin plus gentamicin were consistent (range, 74.8-76.3%) but lower than similar beta-lactam or ciprofloxacin combinations with vancomycin (range, 93.5-96.6%). CONCLUSION: Ongoing surveillance for antimicrobial susceptibility remains essential, and will enhance efforts to identify resistance and attempt to limit its spread.
TI  - Identification of the tetracycline resistance gene, tet(M), in Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae.
AB  - This is the first report to demonstrate the presence of tet(M) in naturally occurring isolates of tetracycline-resistant Erysipelothrix rbusiopathiae, which causes swine erysipelas. The tet(M) gene was isolated from E. rhusiopathiae strain KY5-42. The nucleotide and the deduced amino acid sequence were 99% identical to the tet(M) gene from Enterococcus faecalis. The gene was necessary and sufficient for the expression of tetracycline resistance in Escherichia coli. The presence of the tet(M) gene in the 114 tetracycline-resistant E. rhusiopathiae isolates from diseased pigs was detected by the polymerase chain reaction assay. The specific amplified DNA fragment was obtained from all 114 tetracycline-resistant strains. It was suggested that the tet(M) gene was widely present in the field isolates of E. rhusiopathiae resistant to tetracycline.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of the pathogens of bacteraemia in the UK and Ireland 2001-2002: the BSAC Bacteraemia Resistance Surveillance Programme.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To describe the current patterns of antimicrobial resistance in the major pathogens of bacteraemia in the UK and Ireland, to highlight any unexpected resistance patterns and to act as a reference baseline for future studies. METHODS: In 2001 and 2002, 5092 blood culture isolates were collected by 29 laboratories distributed across the UK and Ireland. A single central laboratory re-identified the isolates and measured MICs by the BSAC agar dilution method. RESULTS: Oxacillin resistance was found in 42% of Staphylococcus aureus and 76% of coagulase-negative staphylococci. Streptococci were generally susceptible to beta-lactams, but tetracycline resistance was common (except in Streptococcus pneumoniae) and particularly common among group B isolates (82% resistant). Nine percent of S. pneumoniae had reduced susceptibility to penicillin (MICs 0.12-1 mg/L), but none required >/=2 mg/L for inhibition. High-level gentamicin resistance was seen in 43% of Enterococcus faecalis, often in combination with raised ciprofloxacin MICs (>/=32 mg/L), but these isolates remained susceptible to ampicillin and imipenem. Only linezolid and tigecycline showed in vitro potency against a large proportion of Enterococcus faecium. Vancomycin resistance was restricted to enterococci (20% of E. faecium, 3% of E. faecalis) and a single isolate of coagulase-negative staphylococci (0.2%, MIC of 8 mg/L). Escherichia coli isolates were commonly resistant to amoxicillin (56%) and tetracycline (88%) but remained susceptible to ceftazidime, piperacillin/tazobactam and imipenem. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases were detected in 2% of E. coli (none in 2001, 3.2% in 2002), 5% of Klebsiella spp. and 8% of Enterobacter spp. Resistance rates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to ciprofloxacin, ceftazidime, gentamicin, imipenem and piperacillin/tazobactam were between 4% and 7%. Among the newly licensed and developmental agents, there was no resistance to linezolid in Gram-positive organisms. Ertapenem had a wide spectrum, covering Enterobacteriaceae, streptococci and oxacillin-susceptible staphylococci. MICs of tigecycline were low for Gram-positive species and Enterobacteriaceae except Proteeae and Enterobacter spp. CONCLUSION: Antimicrobial resistance among major bloodstream pathogens to those antimicrobials often selected for empirical therapy was relatively uncommon in 2001-2002, usually <10%. An important exception was oxacillin resistance in S. aureus.
TI  - Influence of precipitation and soil on transport of fecal enterococci in fractured limestone aquifers.
AB  - Limestone aquifers provide the main drinking water resources of southern Italy. The groundwater is often contaminated by fecal bacteria because of the interaction between rocks having high permeability and microbial pollutants introduced into the environment by grazing and/or manure spreading. The microbial contamination of springwater in picnic areas located in high mountains can cause gastrointestinal illness. This study was carried out in order to analyze the interaction between Enterococcus faecalis and the soil of a limestone aquifer and to verify the influence of this interaction on the time dependence of groundwater contamination. E. faecalis was chosen because, in the study area involved, it represents a better indicator than Escherichia coli. The research was carried out through field (springwater monitoring) and laboratory experiments (column tests with intact soil blocks). The transport of bacterial cells through soil samples was analyzed by simulating an infiltration event that was monitored in the study area. Comparison of laboratory results with data acquired in the field showed that discontinuous precipitation caused an intermittent migration of microorganisms through the soil and produced, together with dispersion in the fractured medium (unsaturated and saturated zones), an articulated breakthrough at the spring. The short distances of bacterial transport in the study area produced a significant daily variability of bacterial contamination at the field scale.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and its susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents--special references to bacteria isolated between April 2002 and March 2003].
AB  - Tendency of isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery during the period from April 2002 to March 2003 were investigated in a multicenter study in Japan, and the following results were obtained. In this series, 334 strains were isolated from 131 (75.3%) of 174 patients with surgical infections. One hundred and seventy-one strains were isolated from primary infections, and 163 strains were isolated from post-operative infections. From primary infections, anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant, while aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant from postoperative infections. Among aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, although the isolation rate of Staphylococcus aureus was the highest, followed by that of Enterococcus faecalis from primary infections, the isolation rate of E. faecalis was the highest from postoperative infections. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Peptostreptococcus spp. was the highest from both types of infections. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in this order, and from postoperative infections, E. coli was the most predominantly isolated, followed by P. aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, and Citobacter freundii. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of Bacteroides fragilis group was the highest from both types of infections. The isolation rate of aerobic Gram-negative bacteria from primary infections and that of aerobic Gram-positive bacteria from postoperative infections were high in the last several years. We noticed no vancomycin-resistant Gram-positive cocci nor P. aeruginosa producing metallo-beta-lactamase. But we noticed cefazolin-resistant E. coli probably producing extended spectrum beta-lactamase.
TI  - Commensal Gram-negative bacteria prime human dendritic cells for enhanced IL-23 and IL-27 expression and enhanced Th1 development.
AB  - Dendritic cells (DC) are the main orchestrators of specific immune responses. Depending on microbial information they encounter in peripheral tissues, they promote the development of Th1, Th2 or unpolarized Th cell responses. In this study we have investigated the immunomodulatory effect of non-pathogenic intestinal Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Bacteroides vulgatus,Veillonella parvula, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and Gram-positive (Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Enterococcus faecalis, Lactobacillus plantarum and Staphylococcus aureus) bacteria on human monocyte-derived DC (moDC). None of the Gram-positive bacteria (GpB) primed for Th1 or Th2 development. In contrast, despite the low levels of IL-12 they induce, all Gram-negative bacteria (GnB) primed moDC for enhanced Th1 cell development, which was dependent on IL-12 and an additional unidentified cofactor. Strikingly, GnB-matured moDC expressed elevated levels of p19 and p28 mRNA, the critical subunits of IL-23 and IL-27, respectively, suggesting that the IL-12 family members may jointly be responsible for their Th1-driving capacity. Purified major cell wall components of either GnB or GpB did not yield Th cell profiles identical to those obtained with whole bacteria, and could not explain the induction of the IL-12 family members nor Th1 priming by GnB. Importantly, this study gives indications that the expression of the different IL-12 family members is dictated by different priming conditions of immature DC.
TI  - The antibacterial innate immune response by the mosquito Aedes aegypti is mediated by hemocytes and independent of Gram type and pathogenicity.
AB  - Previous mosquito studies showed that the hemocyte-mediated innate immune response against Gram- Escherichia coli is phagocytosis, but against Gram+ Micrococcus sp., is melanization. We examined the immune responses mounted by Aedes aegypti towards Gram- Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella typhimurium, and Gram+ Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Using light microscopy, electron microscopy, and survival analysis, this investigation conclusively shows that the factors governing phagocytic vs. melanization responses are complex and independent of bacterial Gram type and pathogenicity. These data provide further evidence that hemocytes are central to the immune response against prokaryotes.
TI  - [Bacterial pathogens, resistance patterns and treatment options in community acquired pediatric urinary tract infection].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Epidemiology and resistance patterns of bacterial pathogens in pediatric UTI show large interregional variability and rates of bacterial resistances are changing due to different antibiotic treatment. We intended to evaluate data from northern Germany. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In 100 children (53 female, 47 male, mean age 4.4 +/- 4.2 years) with community acquired UTI, who presented in the emergency department of our medical school from 2000 - 2002, urine cultures were performed. Inclusion criteria were: acute voiding symptoms, significant bacteriuria with growth of at least 10 (5) colony-forming units/ml urine, leukocyturia > 50/ micro l. Exclusion criteria were underlying renal diseases, anatomic abnormalities of the urinary tract, age < 2 months and recurrent UTI. RESULTS: Patients presented with a mean rectal temperature of 38.6 +/- 1.3 degrees C, mean CRP of 66 +/- 68 mg/dl, mean WBC 13 500 +/- 5 600/ micro l and mean urinary leukocytes of 425 +/- 363/ micro l. In urine cultures E. coli was found in 47 % of the cases, Enterococcus faecalis 23 %, Proteus mirabilis 8 %, Klebsiella oxytoca 4 %, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 5 % and others 13 %. In 76 % one and in 24 % two different bacterial species (60 % Enterococcus faecalis) were cultured. Mean resistance rates were in all bacteria (in E. coli): Ampicillin 53 % (69 %), Ampicillin and Sulbactam 51 % (61 %), Cefalosporin 1 (st) generation (Cefaclor) 48 % (24 %), Cefalosporin 2 (nd) generation (Cefuroxim) 40 % (3 %), Cefalosporin 3 (rd) generation (Cefuroxim) 33 % (0 %), Tobramycin 30 % (2 %), Ciprofloxacine 0 %, Cotrimoxazole 40 % (42 %), Nitrofurantoin 12 % (0 %). CONCLUSION: The resistance rates to Ampicillin (+/- Sulbactam) did not increase as compared to previous analyses (1990 - 1995), however, resistance rates to Cotrimoxazole and 1 (st) generation Cefalosporines increased about 20 %. We conclude that the policies for treatment of UTI in children should be re-evaluated every 5 years according to local resistance rates.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activities of three new quinolones and azithromycin against  aerobic pathogens causing respiratory tract and abdominal wound infections.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In our study the in vitro susceptibility of common pathogens that cause respiratory tract and abdominal wound infections was tested against two newer fluorquinolones (moxifloxacin and gatifloxacin) as well as levofloxacin and azithromycin. METHODS: 50 isolates each of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Haemophilus influenzae isolated from the respiratory tract and from wounds were tested for their susceptibility to moxifloxacin, gatifloxacin, levofloxacin and azithromycin. RESULTS: Moxifloxacin proved to be the most active substance against the tested gram-positive pathogens. Gatifloxacin was the most active against P. aeruginosa. Moxifloxacin and gatifloxacin proved to be comparably active against the clinical isolates of E. coli and H. influenzae. CONCLUSIONS: Moxifloxacin and gatifloxacin display excellent activity against respiratory pathogens as well as nosocomial pathogens causing abdominal wound infections. When treating infections caused by P. aeruginosa the earlier fluorquinolones such as ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin are the substances of choice.
TI  - Oxidative stress involved in the antibacterial action of different antibiotics.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli sensitive to chloramphenicol incubated with this antibiotic suffered oxidative stress with increase of anion superoxide (O2-). This reactive species of oxygen was detected by chemiluminescence with lucigenin. S. aureus, E. coli, and Enterococcus faecalis sensitive to ciprofloxacin exhibited oxidative stress when they were incubated with this antibiotic while resistant strains did not show stimuli of O2-. Other bacteria investigated was Pseudomonas aeruginosa, strains sensitive to ceftazidime and piperacillin presented oxidative stress in presence of these antibiotics while resistant strains were not stressed. Higher antibiotic concentration was necessary to augment O2- in P. aeruginosa biofilm than in suspension, moreover old biofilms were resistant to oxidative stress caused by antibiotics. A ceftazidime-sensitive mutant of P. aeruginosa, coming from a resistant strain, exhibited higher production of O2- than wild type in presence of this antibiotic. There was relation between antibiotic susceptibility and production of oxidative stress.
TI  - Screening of antibacterial extracts from plants native to the Brazilian Amazon Rain Forest and Atlantic Forest.
AB  - More than 20% of the world's biodiversity is located in Brazilian forests and only a few plant extracts have been evaluated for potential antibacterial activity. In the present study, 705 organic and aqueous extracts of plants obtained from different Amazon Rain Forest and Atlantic Forest plants were screened for antibacterial activity at 100 microg/ml, using a microdilution broth assay against Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli. One extract, VO581, was active against S. aureus (minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)=140 microg/ml and minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC)=160 microg/ml, organic extract obtained from stems) and two extracts were active against E. faecalis, SM053 (MIC=80 microg/ml and MBC=90 microg/ml, organic extract obtained from aerial parts), and MY841 (MIC=30 microg/ml and MBC=50 microg/ml, organic extract obtained from stems). The most active fractions are being fractionated to identify their active substances. Higher concentrations of other extracts are currently being evaluated against the same microorganisms.
TI  - Comparative study of the in vitro activity of a new fluoroquinolone, ABT-492.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The in vitro activity of a new fluoroquinolone, ABT-492, was determined. METHODS: MICs were compared with those of two beta-lactams, telithromycin, ciprofloxacin and four later generation fluoroquinolones. The effects of human serum and of inoculum concentration were also investigated. RESULTS: MIC data indicate that ABT-492 has potent activity against Gram-positive organisms with enhanced anti-staphylococcal activity compared with earlier fluoroquinolones, in addition to activity against beta-haemolytic streptococci, pneumococci including penicillin- and fluoroquinolone-resistant strains and vancomycin-susceptible and -resistant Enterococcus faecalis but not Enterococcus faecium. ABT-492 was the most active agent tested against Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Neisseria meningitidis, fluoroquinolone-susceptible Neisseria gonorrhoeae and anaerobes. Good activity was observed for ABT-492 amongst the Enterobacteriaceae and anaerobes tested, but ciprofloxacin showed superior activity for species of Proteus, Morganella and Providencia, as well as for Pseudomonas spp. In common with the other fluoroquinolones tested, organisms with reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin had raised MIC(90)s to ABT-492. The one isolate of H. influenzae tested with reduced fluoroquinolone susceptibility had an ABT-492 MIC close to that of the population lacking a mechanism of quinolone resistance. ABT-492 was more active than ciprofloxacin against Chlamydia spp. An inoculum effect was observed with a number of isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, E. faecium, Klebsiella spp. and Escherichia coli, in addition to moderately raised MICs in the presence of 70% serum protein. The clinical significance of these findings is yet to be determined. CONCLUSIONS: ABT-492 is a new fluoroquinolone with excellent activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms, with many potential clinical uses.
TI  - The possible influence of micro-organisms and putrefaction in the production of GHB in post-mortem biological fluid.
AB  - In recent years, the post-mortem production of the drug of abuse gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) in biological fluids (e.g. blood and urine) has caused various interpretative problems for toxicologists. Previously, other researchers have shown certain microbial species (Pseudomonas spp. and Clostridium aminobutyricum) possess the necessary enzymes to convert GABA to GHB. A preliminary investigation involving putrefied post-mortem blood indicated there was no observed relationship between "endogenous" GHB concentrations and concentrations of common putrefactive markers (tryptamine and phenyl-2-ethylamine). Microbiological analysis identified the presence of various micro-organisms: Clostridia spp., Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, Enterococcus faecalis and Aeromonoas spp. Equine plasma, human blood and urine samples were inoculated with these and an additional micro-organism (Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and incubated at 22 degrees C for 1 month. Following comparison with control samples and pre-inoculation concentrations, the data indicated an apparent production of GHB in unpreserved P. aeruginosa inoculated blood (2.3 mg/l). All other fluoride-preserved and unpreserved samples (including controls) had GHB concentrations <1mg/l. Although this concentration is lower than is typically associated with "endogenous" post-mortem GHB concentrations, this paper proposes a potential microbial production of GHB with time.
TI  - Antibacterial effects of Carica papaya fruit on common wound organisms.
AB  - The purpose of the study was to investigate antibacterial activity of ripe and unripe Carica papaya on selected micro-organisms. Cultures of micro-organisms were routinely maintained in nutrient agar slants at 4 degrees C. Extracts of immature, mature and ripe Carica papaya fruit were obtained by separately grinding factions of the epicarp, endocarp and seeds and filtering them through gauze. Sensitivity tests were conducted by adding 0.06 ml of extract to agar wells (6 mm diameter) prepared from 20 ml agar seeded with 10(6) cells/ml suspension of one of the eight organisms per plate. The inoculated plates were allowed to equilibrate at 4 degrees C for 1 hour, incubated at 37 degrees C for 24 hours, and zones of inhibition measured in millimetres. Anti-bacterial activity was expressed in terms of the radius of zone of inhibition. Seed extracts from the fruit showed inhibition in the following order: B cereus > E coli > S faecalis > S aureus > P vulgaris > S flexneri. No significant difference was found in bacterial sensitivity between immature, mature and ripe fruits. No inhibition zone was produced by epicarp and endocarp extracts. Carica papaya seeds contain anti-bacterial activity that inhibits growth of gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. Observed activity was independent of stage of fruit maturity. Carica papaya has antibacterial effects that could be useful in treating chronic skin ulcers to promote healing.
TI  - Expression, purification, crystallization and preliminary crystallographic studies of the Enterococcus faecalis cytolysin repressor CylR2.
AB  - The expression of an exotoxin called cytolysin contributes to the virulence of Enterococcus faecalis, one of the organisms responsible for antibiotic resistant infections acquired in hospitals. The DNA-binding protein CylR2 is a transcriptional repressor of cytolysin. At a specific cell density, cytolysin triggers signaling events, which result in the dissociation of CylR2 from its DNA-binding site. CylR2 was overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified and crystals diffracting to 1.9 A were obtained in two different crystal forms. One crystal form belongs to space group P4(1), with unit-cell parameters a = 63.7, b = 63.7, c = 41.2 A, alpha = beta = gamma = 90 degrees, and the other belongs to space group P1, with unit-cell parameters a = 36.9, b = 45.0, c = 47.7 A, alpha = 67, beta = 90, gamma = 66 degrees.
TI  - Urinary bactericidal activity, urinary excretion and plasma concentrations of gatifloxacin (400 mg) versus ciprofloxacin (500 mg) in healthy volunteers after a single oral dose.
AB  - In an open randomised double-crossover study 12 volunteers (six men, six women) received a single oral dose of gatifloxacin (400 mg) or ciprofloxacin (500 mg) to assess urinary bactericidal activity (in eight intervals up to 120 h) and pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters (up to 36 h). Plasma concentrations and urinary excretion were determined by HPLC with fluorescence detection, and urinary bactericidal titers (UBT) by microdilution-method, using antibiotic-free urine of each volunteer. The mean maximum plasma concentration of gatifloxacin was 3.35 mg/l and that of ciprofloxacin 2.12 mg/l. The mean (median) cumulative renal excretion of the parent drug was for gatifloxacin 81 (83)% of the administered dose within 120 h and for ciprofloxacin 43 (45)%. The UBTs, i.e. the highest two-fold dilution (antibiotic-free urine as diluent) of urine still being bactericidal, were determined for an Escherichia coli ATCC reference strain and nine clinical uropathogens with the following MICs (mg/l) for gatifloxacin/ciprofloxacin (microdilution, MHB): E. coli ATCC 25922 (0.008/0.008); E. coli 523 (0.06/0.06); Klebsiella pneumoniae 1058 (0.03/0.016); Proteus mirabilis 524 (0.125/0.016); Pseudomonas aeruginosa 561 (1/0.125); Enterococcus faecalis strains 60 an 55 (0.5/1 and 8/32); Staphylococcus aureus strains 248 and 596 (both 0.03/0.125) and S. saprophyticus Ho94 (0.125/0.25). The median UBTs measured within the first 6h for gatifloxacin were between 1:16 and 1:>or=1024 for the Gram-negative strains including P. aeruginosa and between 1:8 and 1:>or=1024 for the five Gram-positive strains. The median UBTs for ciprofloxacin were between 1:64 and 1:>or=1024 for the Gram-negative strains (incl P. aeruginosa) and between 1:1.5 and 1:768 for the five Gram-positive strains. The UBTs up to 12 < 0.05 h showed no difference (P<0.05 ) for both E. coli strains, but ciprofloxacin was superior to gatifloxacin against Klebsiella, Proteus and Pseudomonas strains and gatifloxacin was superior to ciprofloxacin against all Gram-positive strains. For the UBTs at 12-24 h, gatifloxacin was generally superior to ciprofloxacin, but showed no difference in the Proteus and Pseudomonas strains. The areas under the UBT-time-curve (AUBT) up to 120 h showed statistically significant (P ) differences between both quinolones in favour of gatifloxacin against 8 of 10 strains tested, no difference for P. mirabilis and significantly higher activity of ciprofloxacin against P. aeruginosa. In conclusion, gatifloxacin and ciprofloxacin had overall comparable initial urinary bactericidal activity with some differences for specific pathogens, some times in favour of gatifloxacin (Gram-positives) and some times of ciprofloxacin (usually Gram-negatives), suggesting that for empiric therapy a single oral dose of gatifloxacin (400mg) would be clinically equivalent to ciprofloxacin (500 mg) twice daily-in agreement with the results of a clinical study in complicated UTI performed previously [Int. J. Antimicrob. Agents (2004)].
TI  - Antimicrobial activities of heparin-binding peptides.
AB  - Antimicrobial peptides are effector molecules of the innate immune system. We recently showed that the human antimicrobial peptides alpha-defensin and LL-37 bind to glycosaminoglycans (heparin and dermatan sulphate). Here we demonstrate the obverse, i.e. structural motifs associated with heparin affinity (cationicity, amphipaticity, and consensus regions) may confer antimicrobial properties to a given peptide. Thus, heparin-binding peptides derived from laminin isoforms, von Willebrand factor, vitronectin, protein C inhibitor, and fibronectin, exerted antimicrobial activities against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Similar results were obtained using heparin-binding peptides derived from complement factor C3 as well as consensus sequences for heparin-binding (Cardin and Weintraub motifs). These sequence motifs, and additional peptides, also killed the fungus Candida albicans. These data will have implications for the search for novel antimicrobial peptides and utilization of heparin-protein interactions should be helpful in the identification and purification of novel antimicrobial peptides from complex biological mixtures. Finally, consensus regions may serve as templates for de novo synthesis of novel antimicrobial molecules.
TI  - Cervical immunoglobulin A and altered vaginal flora in pregnant women with threatened preterm delivery.
AB  - The aim of our study was to investigate the cervical immunoglobulin A concentration in women with threatened preterm delivery. Immunoglobulin A concentration in the cervical mucus of 80 women with symptoms of preterm delivery was measured using radial immunodiffusion. The results were compared with those of 60 healthy pregnant women. Concentrations of immunoglobulins in maternal serum were also measured. There was no significant difference of cervical immunoglobulin A (IgA) concentration between women with threatened preterm delivery and controls: 53.98 (0.0-189.7) mg/l vs. 61.7 (1.4-400.9; p<0.4) mg/l (median, range). The median of cervical IgA levels in the group of threatened preterm delivery did not differ significantly between patients delivered preterm (n=34) or at term (n=46): 38.3 (0.0-187.9) vs. 65.7 (1.4-189.7; p<0.2) mg/l. Women with a normal vaginal flora showed a significantly higher cervical IgA concentration than those with a pathological colonization: 72.7 (0.0-187.9) vs. 42.5 (0.0-189.7) mg/l. Patients with a pathological vaginal smear and preterm delivery had the lowest IgA levels (35.0; 0.0-187.9 mg/l). Measurement of cervical IgA concentration does not differentiate between women who deliver before or at term.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (2001). III. Secular changes in susceptibility].
AB  - The bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) isolated from patients diagnosed as urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 10 institutions in Japan were supplied between September and December, 2001. Then, the susceptibilities of these bacteria to various antimicrobial agents were examined, and the results were compared with those obtained between 1992 and 2000. Comparison was made by classifying strains isolated from patients into those in uncomplicated UTIs and those in complicated UTIs (including with or without indwelling catheter). The drug sensitivity of S. aureus in this year was comparable to those in up to the previous year, and S. aureus showed the best susceptibility to vancomycin (VCM). E. faecalis showed good susceptibility to ampicillin and imipenem, and the MIC90s were 2 micrograms/mL. The susceptibility of E. faecalis to VCM was also good. E. coli showed good susceptibility to the drugs except penicillins. Among cephems, the susceptibility to cefozopran (CZOP) was better (MIC90: < or = 0.125 microgram/mL). Just as the last report, the decreases in susceptibility of E. coli to quinolones were also observed in the patients with complicated UTIs. The susceptibility of Klebsiella spp. to all the test drugs did not significantly change in 2001 and was generally good but not to penicillins. Among cephems, Klebsiella spp. showed good susceptibility to flomoxef, cefpirome, cefixime, and CZOP with < or = 0.125 microgram/mL of MIC90s either in uncomplicated or complicated UTIs. Although the drug sensitivity of P. aeruginosa was generally low, the detection of the strains that showed good susceptibility to quinolones and carbapenems (MIC: < or = 0.125-2 micrograms/mL) were relatively frequent.
TI  - [Evaluating the effect of quaternary ammonium disinfectants on bacterial strains  of animal origin].
AB  - The authors evaluate two quaternary ammonium compounds, first and second generation, using three methods: minimum bactericide concentration, the suspension test of the German Society for Hygiene and Microbiology and the agar gel diffusion test. The compounds were tested against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis from sheep and pigs. The results show that quaternary ammonia compounds with dodecyl chains have greater efficacy than benzalconium chloride, and that quaternary ammonium compounds are more effective against gram-positive bacteria. No resistance linked to the strains used in the tests was detected. Finally, the authors demonstrate that all three techniques are valid for the evaluation of quaternary ammonium disinfectants.
TI  - Translocation of Enterococcus faecalis strains across a monolayer of polarized human enterocyte-like T84 cells.
AB  - We used a two-chamber system to study transcytosis of Enterococcus faecalis across monolayers of human colon carcinoma-derived T84 cells, which show structural resemblance to the native intestine. Among 16 E. faecalis isolates from different sources, the well-characterized strain OG1RF and 8 other isolates (2 endocarditis isolates, 1 urine isolate, and all 5 fecal isolates) showed translocation in this assay, while 6 clinical isolates (3 endocarditis and 3 urine isolates), the recipient strain JH2-2, and the control, Escherichia coli DH5alpha, had no detectable translocation. Of two OG1RF mutants involving the previously studied epa (enterococcal polysaccharide antigen) gene cluster, known to be needed for virulence and resistance to killing by polymorphonuclear leukocytes, one epa mutant (TX5179) was unable to translocate, while TX5180, with an epa disruption farther downstream, showed a moderate decrease in translocation relative to that of the wild-type strain OG1RF (P < 0.01), indicating that the epa gene cluster is important for translocation across a T84 monolayer. This observation was confirmed by complementation of the epa mutant (TX5179) with epa genes and restoration of its translocation ability. In conclusion, we have demonstrated translocation of at least some strains of E. faecalis across T84 monolayers, although strains differ considerably in this ability, and we have demonstrated that epa mutations can cause marked changes in successful translocation. These results suggest that this model may be a useful in vitro system for studying the process of translocation from the intestinal tract.
TI  - Is 2-phosphoglycerate-dependent automodification of bacterial enolases implicated in their export?
AB  - We observed that in vivo and in vitro a small fraction of the glycolytic enzyme enolase became covalently modified by its substrate 2-phosphoglycerate (2-PG). In modified Escherichia coli enolase, 2-PG was bound to Lys341, which is located in the active site. An identical reversible modification was observed with other bacterial enolases, but also with enolase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and rabbit muscle. An equivalent of Lys341, which plays an important role in catalysis, is present in enolase of all organisms. Covalent binding of 2-PG to this amino acid rendered the enzyme inactive. Replacement of Lys341 of E.coli enolase with other amino acids prevented the automodification and in most cases strongly reduced the activity. As reported for other bacteria, a significant fraction of E.coli enolase was found to be exported into the medium. Interestingly, all Lys341 substitutions prevented not only the automodification, but also the export of enolase. The K341E mutant enolase was almost as active as the wild-type enzyme and therefore allowed us to establish that the loss of enolase export correlates with the loss of modification and not the loss of glycolytic activity.
TI  - Molecular cloning, overexpression, purification, and characterization of an aerobic FMN-dependent azoreductase from Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - Azo dyes represent a major class of synthetic colorants that are ubiquitous in foods and consumer products. Enterococcus faecalis is a predominant member of the human gastrointestinal microflora. Strain ATCC 19433 grew in the presence of azo dyes and metabolized them to colorless products. A gene encoding a putative FMN-dependent aerobic azoreductase that shares 34% identity with azoreductase (AcpD) of Escherichia coli has been identified in this strain. The gene in E. faecalis, designated as azoA, encoded a protein of 208 amino acids with a calculated isoelectric point of 4.8. AzoA was heterologously overexpressed in E. coli with a strong band of 23 kDa on SDS-PAGE. The purified recombinant enzyme was a homodimer with a molecular weight of 43 kDa, probably containing one molecule of FMN per dimer. AzoA required FMN and NADH, but not NADPH, as a preferred electron donor for its activity. The apparent Km values for both NADH and 2-[4-(dimethylamino)phenylazo]benzoic acid (Methyl red) substrates were 0.14 and 0.024 mM, respectively. The apparent Vmax was 86.2 microM/min/mg protein. The enzyme was not only able to decolorize Methyl red, but was also able to convert sulfonated azo dyes Orange II, Amaranth, Ponceau BS, and Ponceau S. AzoA is the first aerobic azoreductase to be identified and characterized from human intestinal gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Harmonization of antimicrobial susceptibility testing among veterinary diagnostic laboratories in the five Nordic countries.
AB  - A total of 100 bacterial strains (25 Escherichia coli, 25 Salmonella enterica, 25 Staphylococcus aureus, and 25 Enterococcus strains) and four reference strains were tested for susceptibility toward 8-12 antimicrobial agents in 12 veterinary diagnostic laboratories in the five Nordic countries using routine methodology. In addition, the 25 Enterococcus strains were identified to species level. A total of 22,598 (97.2%) out of 23,259 test results were in accordance when the data were categorized as susceptible or resistant. When the reported results were categorized according to the National Committee of Clinical Laboratory Standards breakpoints, the percentage of concordant results increased to 98.4% and the performance between laboratories varied between 94.2 and 99.4% concordant results. For E. coli, S. aureus, and Salmonella, all laboratories except one had more than 97% concordant results, whereas for Enterococcus spp., two laboratories had less than 90% concordant results. Susceptibility testing of Salmonella to fluoroquinolones gave rise to almost 0.5% nonconcordant results and susceptibility testing of S. aureus to vancomycin resulted in that 1.8% of the strains were incorrectly reported as vancomycin resistant. Ten laboratories identified the Enterococcus spp. to species level. All five Enterococcus faecium and 10 Enterococcus faecalis selected from the strain collection at the Danish Veterinary Institute were correctly identified by all laboratories, whereas some problems were observed identifying other enterococcal species. This study showed a good performance and agreement in antimicrobial susceptibility testing at the 12 participating laboratories and that surveillance data covering susceptibility test results of E. coli, S. aureus, and Salmonella from animals in the Nordic countries are comparable. But it also showed that some aspects can be improved. In addition, the study showed that the different laboratories are capable of identifying E. faecalis and E. faecium.
TI  - A second tylosin resistance determinant, Erm B, in Arcanobacterium pyogenes.
AB  - Arcanobacterium pyogenes, a common inhabitant of the mucosal surfaces of livestock, is also a pathogen associated with a variety of infections. In livestock, A. pyogenes is exposed to antimicrobial agents used for prophylaxis and therapy, notably tylosin, a macrolide used extensively for the prevention of liver abscessation in feedlot cattle in the United States. Many, but not all, tylosin-resistant A. pyogenes isolates carry erm(X), suggesting the presence of other determinants of tylosin resistance. Oligonucleotide primers designed for conserved regions of erm(B), erm(C), and erm(T) were used to amplify a 404-bp fragment from a tylosin-resistant A. pyogenes isolate, OX-7. DNA sequencing revealed that the PCR product was 100% identical to erm(B) genes, and the erm(B) gene region was cloned in Escherichia coli. The A. pyogenes Erm B determinant had the most DNA identity with an Erm B determinant carried by the Clostridium perfringens plasmid pIP402. However, the A. pyogenes determinant lacked direct repeat DR1 and contained a deletion in DR2. Flanking the A. pyogenes erm(B) gene were partial and entire genes similar to those found on the Enterococcus faecalis multiresistance plasmid pRE25. This novel architecture suggests that the erm(B) element may have arisen by recombination of two distinct genetic elements. Ten of 32 tylosin-resistant isolates carried erm(B), as determined by DNA hybridization, and all 10 isolates carried a similar element. Insertion of the element was site specific, as PCR and Southern blotting analysis revealed that the erm(B) element was inserted into orfY, a gene of unknown function. However, in three strains, this insertion resulted in a partial duplication of orfY.
TI  - DNA binding ligands targeting drug-resistant Gram-positive bacteria. Part 1: Internal benzimidazole derivatives.
AB  - Novel DNA minor-groove binding ligands with a promising antibacterial profile are described. Apart from excellent in vitro potency against multiple Gram-positive bacterial strains such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (VRE), and penicillin-intermediate Streptococcus pneumoniae (PISP), a small subset of compounds was active against Gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli (E. coli).
TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial activities of new bis-benzimidazoles.
AB  - Twenty bis-benzimidazole derivatives were synthesised by the reaction of benzimidazole with appropriate alkyl halides. The compounds synthesised were identified by 1H, 13C-NMR, FT-IR and micro analysis. All compounds studied in this work were screened for their in vitro antibacterial activity against standard strains; Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29212), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 29213), Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853). Ten of the compounds were found effective to inhibit the growth of gram-positive bacteria (E. faecalis and S. aureus) at MIC (minimal inhibitory concentration) values between 50-400 microg/ ml. Two of the compounds showed MIC values of 200 microg/ml against gram-negative bacteria (E. coli and P. aeruginosa).
TI  - Monitoring the efficacy of steam and formaldehyde treatment of naturally Salmonella-infected layer houses.
AB  - AIMS: To monitor if a temperature-humidity-time treatment found to be effective in eliminating Salmonella in laboratory trials (Gradel et al. 2003) was efficient against Salmonella in naturally infected layer houses. METHODS AND RESULTS: Six layer houses with natural Salmonella infections were steam treated in a download period, aiming at >or=60 degrees C and 100% relative humidity (RH) during a 24-h period, with or without the addition of 30 ppm formaldehyde. In addition, two control layer houses were disinfected chemically. Salmonella samples taken from predetermined sites before and after treatment were tested qualitatively for Salmonella and coliforms. Samples with indicator bacteria (feed inoculated with Escherichia coli or Enterococcus faecalis and faeces with naturally occurring E. coli and enterococci) were placed during steam-treatment at 12 sites in each house (where the temperature was logged at 5-min intervals) and tested for surviving bacteria. Generally, the field test results confirmed the results of laboratory tests, especially when 30 ppm formaldehyde was added to the steam. In well-sealed houses, the recommended temperature-humidity-time scheme was accomplished at a minimum of 10 cm above floor level within 1 h. CONCLUSIONS: A steam treatment of >or=60 degrees C and 100% RH during a 24-h period with the addition of 30 ppm formaldehyde at the beginning of the process is recommended for eliminating Salmonella from naturally infected poultry layer houses. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: A specific recommendation for the elimination of Salmonella in poultry houses can be given.
TI  - Enterococcus faecalis mevalonate kinase.
AB  - Gram-positive pathogens synthesize isopentenyl diphosphate, the five-carbon precursor of isoprenoids, via the mevalonate pathway. The enzymes of this pathway are essential for the survival of these organisms, and thus may represent possible targets for drug design. To extend our investigation of the mevalonate pathway in Enterococcus faecalis, we PCR-amplified and cloned into pET-28b the mvaK1 gene thought to encode mevalonate kinase, the fourth enzyme of the pathway. Following transformation of the construct EFK1-pET28b into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells, the expressed C-terminally hexahistidine-tagged protein was purified on a nickel affinity support to apparent homogeneity. The purified protein catalyzed the divalent ion-dependent phosphorylation of mevalonate to mevalonate 5-phosphate. The specific activity of the purified kinase was 24 micromole/min/mg protein. Based on sedimentation velocity data, E. faecalis mevalonate kinase exists in solution primarily as a monomer with a mass of 32.2 kD. Optimal activity occurred at pH 10 and at 37 degrees C. Delta H(a) was 22 kcal/mole. Kinetic analysis suggested that the reaction proceeds via a sequential mechanism. K(m) values were 0.33 mM (mevalonate), 1.1 mM (ATP), and 3.3 mM (Mg(2+)). Unlike mammalian mevalonate kinases, E. faecalis mevalonate kinase utilized all tested nucleoside triphosphates as phosphoryl donors. ADP, but not AMP, inhibited the reaction with a K(i) of 2.7 mM.
TI  - Microorganisms growth in endodontic citric-acid solutions with and without microbiological stabilizer.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine if citric-acid solutions for endodontic use can become contaminated and if the addition of a microbiological stabilizer to the acid would modify this situation. Five types of microorganisms were inoculated in tubes containing 10% citric-acid solutions, pH 1.8 (group A1), and 10% solution, pH 1.8, combined with 0.1% sodium benzoate (group A2). The results demonstrated that solutions of group A1 were contaminated with Candida albicans in 100% of the tubes, Escherichia coli in 80%, and Enterococcus faecalis in 50%. When stabilizer was added (group A2), C. albicans grew in only 30% of tubes and all bacterial species were neutralized.
TI  - Effect of androgens and glucocorticoids on microbial growth and antimicrobial susceptibility.
AB  - The effects of androgens, testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT), of an environmental anti-androgen, 2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)-1,1-dichloroethylene (DDE), and of glucocorticoids, hydrocortisone and dexamethasone, on growth kinetics and antibiotic susceptibility of E. faecalis, E. coli, P. aeurginosa, and S. aureus were measured. For P. aeurginosa, the presence of either DHT or DDE caused at least a fourfold shift in the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of cefepime and tobramycin. DHT and DDE also affected the response of E. faecalis to meropenem and norfloxacin, resulting in a shift from sensitive to intermediate resistance (four-fold increase in MIC). Hydrocortisone (2 microM) induced an increase in the sensitivity of S. aureus to erythromycin, as compared to hormone-free control (from 0.5 to 0.06 microg/mL). The susceptibility pattern of E. coli was unaffected by the hormones tested. These changes in susceptibility to antibiotics were unrelated to alterations in growth kinetics. For all organisms tested, the alterations in MICs occurred only in the presence of hormone, indicative of changes in the phenotype of these stable quality control strains.
TI  - Microbial flora in ileal and colonic neobladders.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe bacterial colonization in patients with ileal and colonic  neobladders. METHODS: Twenty-three patients with right colon neobladders, 30 with ileal neobladders, 11 who had undergone radical prostatectomy, and 6 healthy controls were included. Culture of clean-catch, midstream urine specimens was done weekly for 3 weeks, and this was repeated after 6 months. Residual urine was measured, and the patients were interviewed about leakage. All patients and controls were antibiotic free during the study except for 13 of the ileal neobladder patients, who were treated with trimethoprim 100mg daily. RESULTS: Urine cultures from controls and prostatectomy patients were negative for bacteria, whereas 67% of the specimens from patients with neobladders, not on antibiotic therapy, were culture positive, and half of these contained uropathogenic species, such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterococcus faecalis. Bacterial colonization (including uropathogenic strains) was strongly correlated with residual urine (p<0.005), but not with leakage. Anaerobic strains were found more frequently (p=0.04) in urine from ileal neobladders than in urine from colonic neobladders. The 13 patients with ileal neobladders and on prophylactic antibiotic therapy carried bacteriuria in 80% of the samples, the majority being anaerobic strains. Uropathogenic strains, mainly Enterecoccus faecalis was revealed in 30% of the samples. CONCLUSIONS: The lower urinary tract of patients with ileal or colonic neobladders is heavily colonized with potentially uropathogenic and anaerobic bacteria. Complete bladder emptying reduces the bacterial burden. Anaerobic colonization is increased in neobladders reconstructed from ileum. Prophylactic antibiotic therapy does not seem to reduce the bacterial burden, but interferes with the bacterial composition.
TI  - Assessment of the antibacterial activity of selected flavonoids and consideration of discrepancies between previous reports.
AB  - Activity of the flavonoids apigenin, baicalin and galangin against sensitive and  antibiotic resistant strains of Staphylococculs aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, E. faecium, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was investigated. Using an agar dilution assay, galangin was shown to have a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 25 to 50 microg/mL against all six strains of S. aureus but negligible activity against the othe species. Apigenin displayed only marginal activity against S. aureus and no activity was detected from baicalin. In inhibition curve studies, galangin caused a 100,000-fold decrease in the viability of a growing population of S. aureus NCTC 6571 within the first two hours of treatment. Decreases in viability of S. aureus NCTC 11561 and NCIMB 9968 populations were also observed.
TI  - Characterization of a new erm-related macrolide resistance gene present in probiotic strains of Bacillus clausii.
AB  - The mechanism of resistance to macrolides, lincosamides, and streptogramins B was studied in four Bacillus clausii strains that are mixed in a probiotic administered to humans for prevention of gastrointestinal side effects due to oral antibiotic chemotherapy and in three reference strains of B. clausii, DSM8716, ATCC 21536, and ATCC 21537. An 846-bp gene called erm(34), which is related to the erm genes conferring resistance to these antibiotics by ribosomal methylation, was cloned from total DNA of B. clausii DSM8716 into Escherichia coli. The deduced amino acid sequence presented 61% identity with that of Erm(D) from B. licheniformis, B. halodurans, and B. anthracis. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of total DNA digested by I-CeuI, followed by hybridization with an erm(34)-specific probe, indicated a chromosomal location of the gene in all B. clausii strains. Repeated attempts to transfer resistance to macrolides by conjugation from B. clausii strains to Enterococcus faecalis JH2-2, E. faecium HM1070, and B. subtilis UCN19 were unsuccessful.
TI  - The role of the methylene blue and toluidine blue monomers and dimers in the photoinactivation of bacteria.
AB  - The interactions between the phenothiazine dyes, methylene blue (MB) and toluidine blue (TB), and bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Hemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) were studied spectrophotometrically. This demonstrated that a metachromatic reaction took place between the dyes and bacteria. Furthermore, bacteria induced additional dimerization of MB and TB. The effective dimerization constants of MB and TB were evaluated in the presence of each bacterial strain at a concentration of 10(8) CFU/ml. The analysis of the effective dimerization constants for MB and TB in the presence of bacteria indicated that the ability to form dimers was greater for TB than for MB. Gram-negative bacteria induced the dye dimerization more intensely than gram-positive bacteria. There was a correlation between the ability of each dye to form dimers in the presence of bacteria and the relative photobactericidal efficacy of each dye against these bacteria. These results provide evidence confirming the essential role of the dye dimers in bacterial photodamage.
TI  - New triterpene glycosides from the stems of Anomospermum grandifolium.
AB  - Two new dammarane saponins identified as jujubogenin 3-O-alpha-l-arabinofuranosyl(1-->2)-[beta-d-glucopyranosyl(1-->6) beta-d-glucopyranosyl(1-->3)]-alpha-l-arabinopyranoside (2) and jujubogenin 3-O-alpha-l-arabinofuranosyl(1-->2)-[6-O-[3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl]-beta-d-gluc opyranosyl(1-->3)]-alpha-l-arabinopyranoside (3) and a new lupane saponin, 3beta-hydroxylup-20(29)-en-27,28-dioic acid 28-O-beta-d-glucopyranosyl(1-->2)-[beta-d-xylopyranosyl(1-->3)]-beta-d-xylopyrano syl(1-->2)-beta-d-glucopyranoside ester (5), along with the known jujubogenin 3-O-alpha-l-arabinofuranosyl(1-->2)-[beta-d-glucopyranosyl(1-->3)]-alpha-l-arabin opyranoside (1) and 3beta-hydroxylup-20(29)-ene-27,28-dioic acid (4), were isolated from the methanol extract of the stems of Anomospermum grandifolium. The structures of the new compounds were established by spectral analysis. Antimicrobial activity screening of compounds 1-3 revealed antifungal properties against C. albicans ATCC 3153 for compounds 2 and 3. The antibacterial and antifungal activities of the petroleum ether, chloroform, and methanol extracts of A. grandifolium stems were also evaluated.
TI  - Comparison of oxidative stress induced by ciprofloxacin and pyoverdin in bacteria and in leukocytes to evaluate toxicity.
AB  - Oxidative stress induced by ciprofloxacin and pyoverdin, a leukotoxic pigment, was studied by comparing their effect in bacteria and leukocytes. Chemiluminescence (CL) assays with lucigenin or luminol were adapted to measure the stimuli of superoxide anion (O2 -) and other reactive species of oxygen (ROS) in bacteria. Ciprofloxacin principally induced the production of O2 - in the three species studied: Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli. Lucigenin CL assay showed high oxidative stress in S. aureus due to its low superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, whereas E. coli exhibited important SOD activity, responsible for little production of O2 - in absence or presence of ciprofloxacin. Reduction of nitroblue of tetrazolium (NBT) was applied. This assay indicated that there was higher oxidative stress in S. aureus and E. faecalis than in E. coli. The comparison of oxidative stress generated in bacteria and leukocytes was used to check the selective toxicity of ciprofloxacin in comparison with pyoverdin. Ciprofloxacin did not generate significant stimuli of O2 - in neutrophils, while pyoverdin duplicated the production of O2 -. CL and NBT were useful to study the leukotoxicity of ciprofloxacin. Oxidative stress caused by the antibiotic and the leukotoxic pigment was similar in bacteria.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (2001). II. Background of patients].
AB  - Five-hundred thirty one bacterial strains isolated from 412 patients diagnosed as having urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 10 institutions in Japan were supplied between September and December 2001. Then, the clinical background of patients were investigated such as sex, age, and type of infections, infections and kind of bacteria, frequency of bacteria isolation by age and infections, bacteria and infections by timing of antibiotics administration, and bacteria and infections by surgical procedures. With regard to the relationship between age and sex of patients and type of infections, the number of cases aged lower than 50 years was few and complicated UTIs without indwelling catheter was the most frequent in male patients. In females, the number of patients aged lower than 20 years was few. Most of female patients aged lower than 80 years had uncomplicated UTIs. As for the relationship between type of infections and kind of bacteria, Escherichia coli decreased as the infections were more complicated, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus faecalis increased as the infections were more complicated. In relation of these results to age of patients, isolation frequency of E. coli gradually decreased with aging in patients aged 20 years and older with uncomplicated UTIs. The isolation frequencies of E. faecalis decreased with aging in the patients with complicated UTIs without indwelling catheter while P. aeruginosa decreased with aging in the patients with complicated UTIs with indwelling catheter. E. coli was isolated a few after administration of antibiotics, and P. aeruginosa and E. faecalis were frequently isolated after administration in the patients with all types of infections. As for type of causative organisms in UTIs and with or without surgical operation, E. coli was frequently isolated in the patients without surgery in the patients with uncomplicated UTIs and complicated UTIs without indwelling catheter, while P. aeruginosa was frequently isolated in the patients who underwent surgery in the patients with uncomplicated UTIs and complicated UTIs with indwelling catheter. In uncomplicated UTIs, isolation frequencies of Klebsiella spp., P. aeruginosa, and E. faecalis were significant in the patients with surgery. In complicated UTIs without indwelling catheter, Klebsiella spp. was frequently isolated in the patients with surgery. In complicated UTIs with indwelling catheter, S. aureus and Staphylococcus spp. were frequently isolated in the patients without surgery.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (2001). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The bacterial strains isolated from patients diagnosed as having urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 10 institutions in Japan were supplied between the period of September and December 2001. Then, the susceptibilities of them to a variety of antimicrobial agents were investigated. The number of them were 496 strains. The breakdown of these strains was Gram-positive bacteria as 29.6% and Gram-negative bacteria as 70.4%. Susceptibilities of these bacteria to antimicrobial agents were as follows; against Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin (VCM) showed a strong activity, and this drug also had a strong activity against MRSA in preventing growth of all strains at 1 microgram/mL. In addition, arbekacin (ABK) showed strong activity with the MIC90 of 2 micrograms/mL against MRSA and prevented growth of all strains at 4 micrograms/mL. ABK also showed a strong activity against Staphylococcus epidermidis in preventing growth of all strains at 0.5 microgram/mL. Ampicillin (ABPC) and cefozopran (CZOP) showed a relatively strong activity against S. epidermidis (MIC90: 8 micrograms/mL). ABPC, imipenem (IPM), and VCM showed strong activities against Enterococcus faecalis. No increase of low-susceptible strains in E. faecalis was observed against these antimicrobial agents. Against Escherichia coli, carbapenems showed the highest activities: meropenem (MEPM) prevented growth of all strains at 0.25 microgram/mL; IPM prevented growth of all strains at 0.5 microgram/mL. CZOP and cefotiam (CTM) also showed strong activities against E. coli: MIC90 of CZOP was within 0.125 microgram/mL; MIC90 of CTM was within 0.5 microgram/mL. Quinolone-resistant E. coli was detected at frequency of 9.3%, which was lower than that in the last year, and was higher level than those in up to 1999. MEPM showed the strongest activity against Citrobacter freundii in preventing growth of all strains at 0.125 microgram/mL. Almost all drugs showed strong activities against Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis, and MEPM prevented growth of all strains within 0.125 microgram/mL. Against Serratia marcescens, the MIC90 of gentamicin (GM) was the lowest value being 2 micrograms/mL, and those of IPM and carumonam were 8 and 16 micrograms/mL, respectively. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, almost all drugs were not so active. The MIC90 of GM was 8 micrograms/mL, those of IPM and amikacin were 16 micrograms/mL, and those of all other drugs were over than 32 micrograms/mL.
TI  - Phenyl thiazolyl urea and carbamate derivatives as new inhibitors of bacterial cell-wall biosynthesis.
AB  - Over 50 phenyl thiazolyl urea and carbamate derivatives were synthesized for evaluation as new inhibitors of bacterial cell-wall biosynthesis. Many of them demonstrated good activity against MurA and MurB and gram-positive bacteria including MRSA, VRE and PRSP. 3,4-Difluorophenyl 5-cyanothiazolylurea (3p) with clog P of 2.64 demonstrated antibacterial activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - The influence of organic load on the antimicrobial activity of different concentrations of NaOCl and chlorhexidine in vitro.
AB  - AIM: To evaluate bacterial growth after contact with sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl;  1 and 5%) and chlorhexidine (CHX; 0.12, 0.5 and 1%) in vitro with or without the addition of organic material (bovine serum albumin (BSA) 0.5%). METHODOLOGY: Bacterial samples (American Type Culture Collection (ATCC)) of Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum were kept in contact with each irrigating solution for varying intervals of time: immediately (t0), 5 min (t5), 15 min (t15) and 30 min (t30). Each test was repeated 10 times. In half of the specimens, 0.5% BSA was added as organic material in an attempt to simulate the organic tissue present in the root canal system. Bacterial growth under appropriate condition of incubation was evaluated and compared for each microorganism at all time intervals. RESULTS: A 0.12% CHX solution did not eliminate E. faecalis at any time interval. One percent CHX eliminated all strains, as did both NaOCl concentrations. BSA did not interfere substantially with the antimicrobial activity of any of the irrigating solutions. CONCLUSIONS: Under the condition of this study, a 0.12% CHX solution was ineffective at killing E. faecalis.
TI  - Structural genomics of highly conserved microbial genes of unknown function in search of new antibacterial targets.
AB  - With more than 100 antibacterial drugs at our disposal in the 1980's, the problem of bacterial infection was considered solved. Today, however, most hospital infections are insensitive to several classes of antibacterial drugs, and deadly strains of Staphylococcus aureus resistant to vancomycin--the last resort antibiotic--have recently begin to appear. Other life-threatening microbes, such as Enterococcus faecalis and Mycobacterium tuberculosis are already able to resist every available antibiotic. There is thus an urgent, and continuous need for new, preferably large-spectrum, antibacterial molecules, ideally targeting new biochemical pathways. Here we report on the progress of our structural genomics program aiming at the discovery of new antibacterial gene targets among evolutionary conserved genes of uncharacterized function. A series of bioinformatic and comparative genomics analyses were used to identify a set of 221 candidate genes common to Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. These genes were split between two laboratories. They are now submitted to a systematic 3-D structure determination protocol including cloning, protein expression and purification, crystallization, X-ray diffraction, structure interpretation, and function prediction. We describe here our strategies for the 111 genes processed in our laboratory. Bioinformatics is used at most stages of the production process and out of 111 genes processed--and 17 months into the project--108 have been successfully cloned, 103 have exhibited detectable expression, 84 have led to the production of soluble protein, 46 have been purified, 12 have led to usable crystals, and 7 structures have been determined.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of extracts of local cough mixtures on upper respiratory tract bacterial pathogens.
AB  - The punched-hole and the paper disc diffusion methods were used in screening for  the antimicrobial activity of six common ingredients used locally in cough mixtures, against the following bacteria: Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus. Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp, Salmonella paratyphi, Shigella dysenteria, Shigella sonnei and Candida albicans. The results, evaluated as the diameter of zone of inhibition of microbial growth, showed that lime, garlic onion, onion and honey were active against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, Candida albicans, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp and Shigella dysenteriae. Bitter-kola nut extract and palm kernel oil showed no antimicrobial activities against any of the tested organisms. None of the extracts inhibited the growth of Salmonella paratyphi and Shigella sonnei and the most susceptible organisms were Escherichia coli and Salmonella spp.
TI  - EfrAB, an ABC multidrug efflux pump in Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - A DNA fragment responsible for resistance to antimicrobial agents was cloned from the chromosomal DNA of Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212 by using drug-hypersensitive mutant Escherichia coli KAM32 as a host cell. Cells of E. coli KAM32 harboring a recombinant plasmid (pAEF82) carrying the DNA fragment became resistant to many structurally unrelated antimicrobial agents, such as norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, doxycycline, acriflavine, 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, tetraphenylphosphonium chloride, daunorubicin, and doxorubicin. Since the sequence of the whole genome of E. faecalis is known, we sequenced several portions of the DNA insert in plasmid pAEF82 and identified two open reading frames within the insert. We designated the genes efrA and efrB. A search of the deduced amino acid sequences of EfrA and EfrB revealed that they are similar to each other and that they belong to the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family of multidrug efflux transporters. Transformed E. coli KAM32 cells harboring efrAB showed energy-dependent efflux of acriflavine. The efflux activity was inhibited by reserpine, verapamil, and sodium-o-vanadate, known inhibitors of ABC efflux pumps.
TI  - Antibiotics with a selective aerobic or anaerobic spectrum have different therapeutic activities in various regions of the colon in interleukin 10 gene deficient mice.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Multiple rodent models implicate resident intestinal bacteria in the pathogenesis of chronic immune mediated intestinal inflammation. Specific pathogen free (SPF) interleukin 10 gene deficient (IL-10(-/-)) mice develop colitis, which does not occur in the germ free (GF) state. We investigated whether broad or narrow spectrum antibiotics affect onset and progression of disease in various regions of IL-10(-/-) mice. METHODS: Metronidazole, ciprofloxacin, vancomycin-imipenem (50 mg/kg/day), or water (control) was administered orally before (prevention) or two weeks after (treatment) colonisation of GF IL-10(-/-) mice with SPF bacteria. After four weeks, colonic histology scores and cytokine production by colonic explants were determined. Caecal and colonic contents were collected for quantitative bacterial analysis. RESULTS: In the prevention study, all antibiotics decreased inflammation in the caecum and colon. However, in the treatment study, ciprofloxacin and vancomycin-imipenem decreased caecal inflammation, and reduced Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis concentrations, whereas only vancomycin-imipenem lowered direct microscopic bacterial counts. In contrast, metronidazole and vancomycin-imipenem reduced colonic injury and eliminated anaerobic bacteria, including Bacteroides spp. CONCLUSIONS: Both narrow and broad spectrum antibiotics can prevent disease but treatment of established colitis is more selective. Ciprofloxacin is most effective in the treatment of caecal inflammation, metronidazole preferentially treats the colon, whereas vancomycin-imipenem definitively treats both regions. These results suggest that subsets of aerobic or anaerobic bacteria show regional differences in their capacity to mediate experimental colitis in IL-10(-/-) mice.
TI  - Species distribution and antibiotic resistance patterns of enterococci isolated from food of animal origin in Germany.
AB  - Presently, enterococci take the third place of bacterial pathogens associated with nosocomial infections, after staphylococci and Escherichia coli. Especially, the resistances of enterococci to several available antibiotics are threatening. We attempted to determine which species of enterococci could be found in food of animal origin and their significance according to their antibiotic resistances for human beings. From November 2000 to May 2002 we investigated 155 samples of food of animal origin bought in retail outlets in Germany: 27 samples of sausages, 19 of ham, 83 of minced meat, 26 of cheese. From these food samples we isolated 416 enterococcal strains. The most frequent species was Enterococcus faecalis (299 strains); furthermore, we found Enterococcus faecium (54 strains), Enterococcus durans together with Enterococcus hirae (24 strains), Enterococcus casseliflavus (22 strains), Enterococcus avium (9 strains) and Enterococcus gallinarum (8 strains). We focused on the resistance patterns of 118 selected E. faecium and E. faecalis strains to 13 antimicrobial active agents (ampicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, avilamycin, chloramphenicol, enrofloxacin, erythromycin, flavomycin, gentamicin, penicillin, quinupristin/dalfopristin, teicoplanin, tetracycline and vancomycin). From the clinical point of view, the situation of antibiotic resistance to the examined antimicrobial agents seemed to be favourable. The investigated strains were sensitive to ampicillin and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. These antibiotics are, in combination with an aminoglycoside, for example gentamicin, agents of choice for the treatment of enterococcal infections in human medicine. Only one E. faecium strain was resistant to penicillin, while all strains were sensitive to the glycopeptide antibiotics, vancomycin and teicoplanin. Resistances found against the antibiotics, tetracycline, quinupristin/dalfopristin and erythromycin, are causes for concern.
TI  - E.s.r., magnetic, optical and biological (SOD and antimicrobial) studies of imidazolate bridged Cu(II)-Zn(II) and Cu(II)-Ni(II) complexes with tris(2-amino ethyl)amine as capping ligand: a plausible model for superoxide dismutase.
AB  - X-band e.s.r. and optical absorption spectra of the imidazolate bridged heterobimetallic complexes [(tren)Cu-E-Im-Zn-(tren)](ClO(4))(3) and [(tren)Cu-E-Im-Ni-(tren)](ClO(4))(3), where trentris(2-aminoethyl)amine, E-Im=2-ethylimidazolate ion and the related mononuclear complexes [Cu(tren)](ClO(4))(2) and [(tren)Cu-E-ImH)](ClO(4))(2) have been described. Biological activities (superoxide dismutase and antimicrobial) have also been measured and compared with reported complexes.
TI  - The screening of hydrogen peroxide-producing lactic acid bacteria and their application to inactivating psychrotrophic food-borne pathogens.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria were isolated from various food samples and evaluated for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production. Cells suspended in 0.5% (wt/vol) glucose plus 0.5% (wt/vol) lactate (pH 7.0) were incubated for 5 h at 37 degrees C under aeration. Among 193 strains, 27 strains accumulated 201-300 ppm H2O2, and 4 strains accumulated more than 301 ppm H2O2 in the cell suspensions. Among the 9 high-level H2O2-producing strains, 8 strains were identified as Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis. The cell-free filtrate from Lc. lactis subsp. lactis AI 62, which contained approximately 350 ppm H2O2, was evaluated for antimicrobial activity against Enterococcus faecalis, Ent. faecium, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, Listeria ivanovii, Staphylococcus aureus, Yersinia enterocolitica, and Aeromonas hydrophila. After 1 h incubation at 30 degrees C in the cell-free filtrate, the initial viable cell counts of the target bacteria (5.53-6.00 log cfu/mL) were reduced by 0.12-5.00 log units, except in the case of enterococci. The sensitivity varied with the bacterial species and pH. The enterococci were resistant to the treatment. Our results show that H2O2 accumulated by lactic acid bacteria in a cell suspension is very effective in reducing the viable cell count of food-borne pathogens.
TI  - Prospective study of bacteremia after cardiac catheterization.
AB  - Nine hundred sixty consecutive cardiac catheterization procedures were studied prospectively for the presence of periprocedural bacteremia. Overall, among 960 procedures, only 4 were associated with clinically significant bacteremia. All 4 were related to the intravenous line and none to the cardiac procedure itself. Clinically nonsignificant bacteremias were correlated with procedural duration, multiple skin punctures, use of multiple balloons, and obesity.
TI  - Identification of species of Brucella using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy.
AB  - Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) is a technique that has been used  over the years in chemical analysis for the identification of substances and is one that may be applied to the characterisation of microorganisms. The marked tendency of Brucella towards variation in the smooth rough phase, together with the laboriousness and risk involved in the methods used in their identification, make their classification difficult. We studied the type strains of the different species and biovars of Brucella and 11 isolates of human origin of Brucella melitensis, six corresponding to biovar 1, one to biovar 2 and five to biovar 3. The results of linear discriminant analysis performed using the data provide an above 95% likelihood of correct classification, over half of which are in fact above 99% for the vast majority of Brucella strains. Only one case of B. melitensis biovar 1 has been incorrectly classified. The rest of the microorganisms studied (Staphylococcus aureus, Strteptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Corynebacterium pseudodiphtheriticum, Clostridium perfringens, Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) have been classified correctly in all cases to a likelihood of over 80%. In the graphic representation of the analysis, a grouping of these can be seen in clusters, which include the different species. One of these comprises B. melitensis, another Brucella abortus, and another wider one is made up of Brucella suis. The Brucella canis, Brucella ovis and Brucella neotomae strains appear separate from the previously described groups.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of short hydrophobic and basic-rich peptides.
AB  - OBJECTIVE-To design short and potent analogs of bovine lactoferricin by use of the concepts of lipophilic bulk and cationic charge. SAMPLE POPULATION-5 synthetic peptides of bovine lactoferricin. PROCEDURE: Antibacterial peptides were constructed by synthesizing several decapeptides rich in arginine and tryptophan. Basic residues of bovine lactoferricin (bLf 20-29; residues 20 to 29) were modified by substitution with arginine or lysine and nonbasic residues were modified by substitution with tryptophan, phenylalanine, or isoleucine. Synthetic peptides of bovine lactoferrin (LFB) were designated as LFB-RW (RRWWWRWRRW), LFB-KW (KKWWWKWKKW), LFB-RWa (RRWWRRWRRW), LFB-RF (RRFFFRFRRF), and LFB-RI (RRIIIRWRRI), where R, K, W, F, and I stand for arginine, lysine, tryptophan, phenylalanine, and isoleucine, respectively. Peptides were evaluated by determining their minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis. RESULTS: LFB-RW, LFB-KW, and LFB-RWa possessed equivalent potency as bLf 20-29 against E coli. LFB-RW and LFB-RWa had a 2-fold increase in growth-inhibitory and bactericidal activity against S aureus, compared with bLf 20-29. LFB-RI had the lowest MIC value against E coli among the peptides but lost bactericidal activity. LFB-RW and LFB-KW had stronger bactericidal activities against S aureus or E faecalis, respectively, as well as E coli than the other synthetic peptides. LFB-RF also had antibacterial activity, but this was 2-fold less than that of LFB-RW, as determined by MIC and MBC values. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: In construction of potent antibacterial peptides, inclusion of arginine, lysine, tryptophan, or isoleucine residues enhances effectiveness against certain bacteria, as measured by MIC or MBC values.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of different concentrations of NaOCl and chlorhexidine using a contact test.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to analyze the in vitro antimicrobial activity of sodium hypochlorite (1% and 5%) and chlorhexidine (0.12%, 0.5% and 1%). Bacterial samples (ATCC) of Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum were submitted to a contact test. Solutions were evaluated at different time intervals: immediately, 5 min, 15 min, and 30 min after contact and repeated 10 times. The results of the contact test showed that 0.12% chlorhexidine did not eliminate E. faecalis at any time interval, while 0.5% and 1% chlorhexidine and 1% and 5% sodium hypochlorite did. These results permit us to conclude that to obtain better antimicrobial activity, chlorhexidine in a concentration greater than 0.12% should be used.
TI  - Soft antimicrobial agents: synthesis and activity of labile environmentally friendly long chain quaternary ammonium compounds.
AB  - A series of soft quaternary ammonium antimicrobial agents, which are analogues to currently used quaternary ammonium preservatives such as cetyl pyridinium chloride and benzalkonium chloride, were synthesized. These soft analogues consist of long alkyl chain connected to a polar headgroup via chemically labile spacer group. They are characterized by facile nonenzymatic and enzymatic degradation to form their original nontoxic building blocks. However, their chemical stability has to be adequate in order for them to have antimicrobial effects. Stability studies and antibacterial and antiviral activity measurements revealed relationship between activity, lipophilicity, and stability. Their minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was as low as 1 microg/mL, and their viral reduction was in some cases greater than 6.7 log. The structure-activity studies demonstrate that the bioactive compounds (i.e., MIC for Gram-positive bacteria of <10 microg/mL) have an alkyl chain length between 12 and 18 carbon atoms, with a polar headgroup preferably of a small quaternary ammonium group, and their acquired inactivation half-life must be greater than 3 h at 60 degrees C.
TI  - The antimicrobial efficacy of 'MGP' gutta-percha in vitro.
AB  - AIM: To determine whether 'MGP' gutta-percha (Westport, CT, USA), a commercially  available gutta-percha containing iodoform, inhibits the growth of potential endodontic pathogens. METHODOLOGY: Inocula of Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus sanguis, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Actinomyces odontolyticus were spread onto the surface of agar plates. 'MGP' gutta-percha cones presoaked in sterile water were transferred to the inoculated agar and incubated at 37 degrees C aerobically or anaerobically as required for optimal growth. Identical studies were performed using iodoform-free gutta-percha and sterile paper disks saturated with 10% povidone-iodine. Following incubation, zones of inhibition around the 'MGP' gutta-percha, iodoform-free gutta-percha and disks were evaluated. RESULTS: Povidone-iodine inhibited all the strains. Iodoform-free gutta-percha inhibited S. sanguis and A. odontolyticus. 'MGP' gutta-percha inhibited S. aureus, S. sanguis, A. odontolyticus and F. nucleatum. Neither iodoform-free gutta-percha nor 'MGP' gutta-percha inhibited growth of E. faecalis, E. coli or P. aeruginosa. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to iodoform-free gutta-percha, iodoform-containing 'MGP' gutta-percha had an inhibitory effect in vitro on S. aureus and F. nucleatum, but not on E. faecalis, E. coli or P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Levofloxacin versus ciprofloxacin in the treatment of chronic bacterial prostatitis: a randomized double-blind multicenter study.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To compare the safety and efficacy of levofloxacin with that of ciprofloxacin for the treatment of chronic bacterial prostatitis. METHODS: In a multicenter, double-blind, active-control trial, 377 men with a history of chronic bacterial prostatitis, current clinical signs and symptoms, and laboratory evidence of prostatitis were randomized to treatment with levofloxacin 500 mg once daily or ciprofloxacin 500 mg twice daily for 28 days. The primary endpoint was microbiologic efficacy in the microbiologically assessable population. The Meares-Stamey "four-glass" procedure was used to obtain prostatic secretions and urine for culture. RESULTS: A total of 377 subjects received the study drug. The clinical success rates, including cured plus improved patients, were similar (75% for levofloxacin and 72.8% for ciprofloxacin; 95% confidence interval for the difference in the success rates: -13.27 to 8.87), as were the microbiologic eradication rates (75% for levofloxacin and 76.8% for ciprofloxacin; 95% confidence interval for the difference -8.98 to 12.58). Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli were the most common isolates. The 6-month relapse rates were similar for both regimens. Both levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin were well tolerated, with similar rates of adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Levofloxacin 500 mg once daily for 28 days is as effective as ciprofloxacin 500 mg twice daily for 28 days for the treatment of chronic bacterial prostatitis. Isolation of a high proportion of gram-positive organisms, as well as gram-negative pathogens, underscores the necessity of choosing an antimicrobial agent with broad-spectrum activity.
TI  - Screening of Bifidobacterium strains isolated from human faeces for antagonistic  activities against potentially bacterial pathogens.
AB  - As probiotic bacteria, strains belonging to the genus Bifidobacterium colonise the gastro-intestinal tract of humans and animals at the time of birth, and they are found in young as well as in adult individuals in great numbers. Moreover, they can interact with the development of enteric infections by the production of antimicrobial metabolites. In this work 281 strains of bifidobacteria were anaerobically isolated from human faecal samples, supplied by volunteers of different ages (youngs, adults, elders), and preliminarly described by microscopic observation. All strains were screened by the fructose 6-phosphate phosphoketolase (F6PPK) test in order to confirm their classification within the genus Bifidobacterium. Selected strains were used to evaluate their antagonistic activities against Escherichia coli, Salmonella thyphimurium, Staphylococcus lentus, Enterococcus faecalis, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Sphingomonas paucimobilis, Listeria monocytogenes, Yersinia enterocolitica, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium sporogenes. Experiments were performed in vitro by different methods based on the observation of growth inhibition in Petri dishes. The strains that showed the highest inhibiting activities were compared by SDS-PAGE for total cell proteins, using type strains of human origin as references. Representative isolates were metabolically characterised by the BIOLOG system; a specific database was created with strains obtained from our collection and a statistical evaluation for metabolic patterns was carried out.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance in Burkina Faso.
AB  - Burkina Faso is one of the Subsaharan African nations. No national services for monitoring of antibiotic resistance are available, so the number of reports of resistance patterns among hospital pathogens are inconsistent. In order to evaluate antibiotic resistance, a total of 1998 valuable microrganisms were analysed during 2000 at the Medical Centre St. Camille of Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso's capital. They were isolated as follows: 1012 from urine-culture, 503 from tonsil swabs, 398 from pus, 53 from sputum and 32 from blood-cultures. Escherichia coli was the most isolated microrganism from urine (44%); Enterococcus faecalis from tonsil swabs (96.4%), Staphylococcus aureus from pus (17%) and K. pneumoniae (70%) from sputum. In general, resistance to the old antibiotics, such as aminopenicillins and cotrimoxazole was shown. The most active antibiotic was norfloxacin, a rarely used antibiotic in this country. In conclusion, our study shows that it is necessary to create antibiotic-resistance surveillance centers in the developing countries to adopt an accurate therapy to avoid exporting of antibiotic resistance to the developed countries linked to increased emigration.
TI  - Diverse effects of ascorbic acid and palmitoyl ascorbate on Helicobacter pylori survival and growth.
AB  - Among many antioxidants used in the food, pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries, ascorbic acid (AA) is one of the most important. AA has been suggested to decrease the risk of gastric disease (gastritis, duodenal ulcer, and carcinoma) by direct action on Helicobacter pylori. However, there are limited studies on the possible role of AA and its derivatives such as palmitoyl ascorbate (PA) on the growth and survival of H. pylori. In the present study it was demonstrated in vitro that AA in the concentration range 10-20 mg x ml(-1) (50-100 mM) inhibited H. pylori growth in liquid medium under microaerophilic conditions. In contrast, under aerobic conditions AA in the concentration range 2-20 mg x ml(-1) (10-100 mM) significantly increased the survival of H. pylori presumably eliminating the toxic effect of reactive oxygen species on bacterial cells. The hydrophobic derivative of AA, PA (a food antioxidant), demonstrated a strong antibacterial effect, under both aerobic and microaerophilic conditions in the concentration range 0.04-0.4 mg x ml(-1) (0.1-1.0 mM). This effect was also tested on other bacterial strains: Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Clostridium sporogenes and Campylobacter jejuni. Among these bacterial strains, PA showed a similar inhibitory effect on B. cereus and B. subtilis as observed with H. pylori. The results suggest that PA may be considered an important AA derivative in eradication of H. pylori in vitro and in vivo and to decrease the risk for gastric diseases.
TI  - Evaluation of the antimicrobial efficacy of urinary catheters impregnated with antiseptics in an in vitro urinary tract model.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the long-term efficacy of urinary Foley catheters (latex  and silicone) impregnated with (1) chlorhexidine and silver sulfadiazine (CXS) and (2) chlorhexidine, silver sulfadiazine, and triclosan (CXST) in inhibiting extra-luminal bacterial adherence and to compare their efficacy with that of silver hydrogel latex (SH) and nitrofurazone-treated silicone (NF) catheters. DESIGN: The antimicrobial spectrum of these catheters was evaluated using a zone of inhibition assay. A novel in vitro urinary tract model was developed to study the potential in vivo efficacy of antimicrobial catheters in preventing extraluminal bacterial colonization. The "meatus" was inoculated daily with Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aerginosa, and Candida albicans. The "bladder" portion of the model was cultured daily to determine bacterial growth. RESULTS: Both CXS and CXST catheters had a broader antimicrobial spectrum than SH and NF catheters. In the in vitro model, CXST latex and silicone catheters exhibited significantly better efficacy (3 to 25days) against uropathogens, compared with CXS (1 to 14 days) and control (0 to 5 days) catheters (P = .01). CXST latex catheters exhibited significantly longer protection against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, compared with SH catheters (P = .01). CXST silicone catheters resisted colonization with Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis for a significantly longer period (23 to 24 days) than did NF catheters (9 to 11 days) (P = .01). CONCLUSION: Catheters impregnated with synergistic combinations of chlorhexidine, silver sulfadiazine, and triclosan exhibited broad-spectrum, long-term resistance against microbial colonization on their outer surfaces.
TI  - In vitro activities of novel oxapenems, alone and in combination with ceftazidime, against gram-positive and gram-negative organisms.
AB  - Four novel oxapenem compounds (i.e., AM-112, AM-113, AM-114, and AM-115) were investigated for their beta-lactamase inhibitory activity against a panel of isolated class A, C, and D enzymes, which included expanded-spectrum beta-lactamase enzymes (ESBLs). The oxapenems were potent beta-lactamase inhibitors. Activity varied within the group, with AM-113 and AM-114 proving to be the most active compounds. The 50% inhibitory concentrations for these agents were up to 100,000-fold lower than that of clavulanic acid against class C and D enzymes. As a group, the oxapenems were more potent than clavulanic acid against enzymes from all classes. The ability of these compounds to protect ceftazidime from hydrolysis by beta-lactamase-producing strains was evaluated by MIC tests that combined ceftazidime and each oxapenem in a 1:1 or 2:1 ratio. The oxapenems markedly reduced the MICs for ceftazidime against class C hyperproducing strains and strains producing TEM- and SHV-derived ESBLs. There was little difference between the activity of 1:1 and 2:1 combinations of ceftazidime and oxapenem. The oxapenems failed to enhance the activity of ceftazidime against derepressed AmpC-producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains.
TI  - [Evaluation of sensitivity to antibiotics of microorganisms isolated from children with urinary tract infections].
AB  - The incidence of etiological factors of urinary tract infections in children and  in vitro susceptibility of these strains to antibiotics were evaluated. 1082 strains isolated from 905 samples of urine of children hospitalized in the period of 01.01-31.12.2001 were tested. Among the isolated microorganisms, the most common group was the Enterobacteriaceae family (57.4%) and also very often Gram-positive cocci were isolated (34.2%). The most frequent causative agents of UTI (Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis) were generally sensitive to all used antibiotics, but E. coli rods were resistant to ampicillin. In addition, 23.4% of E. coli were the ESBL-producing strains.
TI  - Molecular analysis of the Enterococcus faecalis serotype 2 polysaccharide determinant.
AB  - We previously described a 15-kb genetic cluster consisting of 11 open reading frames (cps2A to cps2K) of Enterococcus faecalis FA2-2 that is responsible for the production of the serotype 2 capsular polysaccharide. By using transcriptional fusions to a promoterless lacZ gene, we identified two independent promoters related to the expression of the polysaccharide. Both transcription initiation sites were mapped by primer extension. Reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) demonstrated the transcriptional linkage of genes present in both transcripts. Real-time RT-PCR quantification of transcripts revealed maximum transcription during log phase growth, an observation confirmed by promoter fusion studies. The heterologous expression of this pathway in Escherichia coli caused reactivity with E. faecalis type 2 antiserum, thus demonstrating the essential role of this pathway in the synthesis of the type-specific polysaccharide.
TI  - Small-fragment genomic libraries for the display of putative epitopes from clinically significant pathogens.
AB  - Taking advantage of whole genome sequences of bacterial pathogens in many thriving diseases with global impact, we developed a comprehensive screening procedure for the identification of putative vaccine candidate antigens. Importantly, this procedure relies on highly representative small-fragment genomic libraries that are expressed to display frame-selected epitope-size peptides on a bacterial cell surface and to interact directly with carefully selected disease-relevant high-titer sera. Here we describe the generation of small-fragment genomic libraries of Gram-positive and Gram-negative clinically significant pathogens, including Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Helicobacter pylori, Chlamydia pneumoniae, the enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, and Campylobacter jejuni. Large-scale sequencing revealed that the libraries, which provide an average of 20-fold coverage, were random and, as demonstrated with two S. aureus libraries, highly representative. Consistent with the comprehensive nature of this approach is the identification of epitopes that reside in both annotated and putatively novel open reading frames. The use of these libraries therefore allows for the rapid and direct identification of immunogenic epitopes with no apparent bias or difficulty that often associate with conventional expression methods.
TI  - Crayfish broth for bacterial culture.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To formulate a new growth medium for bacteriological studies. METHODS: Sun dried white shrimps, Nematopalaemon hastatus, were ground into fine powder and infused in distilled water at 7+/-1 degrees C for 24 h. The pH of the infusion was adjusted to 7.2 with NaOH (0.1 m) and HCl (0.1 m) and evaporated to dryness. Crayfish broth (CB) was produced by reconstituting the concentrate in distilled water and sodium chloride was added at 0.9% w/v. Crayfish infusion agar (CIA) and crayfish starch agar (CSA) were prepared with CB as nutrient base. The crayfish broth and agar were evaluated alongside with nutrient broth and agar (Oxoid) for ability to support growth of pathogens such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella aerogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis. Crayfish broth was tested for suitability for sugar fermentation and indole test and results compared with those obtained with peptone water. Its suitability as a sensitivity test medium was evaluated using ampicillin (10 microg) and gentamicin (10 microg) discs and results compared with those obtained using Mueller-Hinton agar (Oxoid). RESULTS: Crayfish broth comprises crayfish infusion concentrate 3.5 g and sodium chloride 9.0 g dissolved in one litre of distilled water. The crayfish broth, CSA supported the growth of the test pathogens with cultural characteristics similar to those seen on nutrient agar. The pH of the spent crayfish broth was near neutral (pH 6.9). The broth was as important as peptone water for sugar fermentation test but was not suitable for indole test. The results of antibiotic susceptibility test on CIA were comparable with those obtained on Mueller-Hinton agar with difference in zone diameters of not more than 1 mm. CONCLUSION: Crayfish broth possesses enormous potential as a new growth medium for bacterial studies.
TI  - Functional characterization of pro-biotic pharmaceuticals by quantitative analysis of gene expression.
AB  - Functional characterization and quality control of complex biological pharmaceuticals are currently difficult to achieve. Classical analytical methods are not suitable due to the heterogeneity of such substances. Conventional biological assays based on the detection of proteins and functional physiologic responses are highly variable in sensitivity and therefore, difficult to standardize. The quantification of expressed genes in contrast, does not require the accumulation of measurable protein and hence is a more sensitive and dynamic method for the functional characterization of complex biological substances. This report describes a standardized system based on real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which allows a reliable stability monitoring and quality control of such preparations, as exemplified by three pro-biotic pharmaceuticals that contain living bacteria of Enterococcus faecalis (Symbioflor-1), Escherichia coli (Symbioflor-2) and a preparation of sterile autolysate of both species (Pro-Symbioflor). This system might be universally applicable to characterize complex biological pharmaceuticals by selecting appropriate sets of target cells and regulated genes.
TI  - A prospective study of infections in lung cancer patients admitted to the hospital.
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: To determine the type of infections occurring in hospitalized patients with lung cancer. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Department of internal medicine in a cancer hospital. PATIENTS: All patients with lung cancer who were hospitalized for any cause and who acquired infections at the time of admission or during the hospital stay between January 1997 and February 2001. INTERVENTIONS: None. RESULTS: Two hundred seventy-five patients with lung cancer had 435 episodes of fever and/or microbiologically or otherwise documented infection. Two hundred eighteen patients (79.3%) presented with non-small cell lung carcinoma, while 49 patients (17.8%) had small cell lung cancer. The majority of the infections occurred in the tracheobronchial tree (56%). There were 38 episodes of bacteremia or fungemia, and the primary site of infection was identified in 18 cases (47%). Microbiologically documented infections accounted for 61% of the infectious episodes, and included a total of 312 microorganisms. The most frequent pathogens were Gram-negative bacteria (64%), followed by Gram-positive bacteria (25%) and fungi (8%). The predominant Gram-negative bacteria were Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis. Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, coagulase-negative staphylococci, and Enterococcus faecalis essentially represented the Gram-positive bacteria. No multiresistant bacteria were observed. Bacteria were susceptible to most of the antibiotics classically administered for their treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The predominant site of infection in patients with lung cancer is the tracheobronchial tree, with S pneumoniae, S aureus, H influenzae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and M catarrhalis as the principal pathogens.
TI  - Bacterial translocation after cirrhotic liver resection: a clinical investigation of 181 patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cirrhotic patients are usually associated with a high susceptibility  to infection. Although bacterial translocation from gut mucosa to mesenteric lymph node (MLN) and systemic circulation is a well-known phenomenon after hepatectomy, its role in cirrhotic patients remains unclear. MATERIALS AND METHODS: MLN was harvested for bacterial culture before and after liver resection in 181 cirrhotic patients. The characteristics and postoperative courses of patients with positive and negative bacterial culture for MLN after hepatectomy were compared. Postoperative systemic antibiotics were administered if infectious complications occurred. RESULTS: No bacteria were cultured in MLN before hepatectomy. Bacterial translocation (BT) to MLN after hepatectomy occurred in 36 patients (BT group). After multivariate analysis, intraoperative blood transfusion was the only independent factor that influenced bacterial translocation rates after cirrhotic liver resection. BT group patients also had higher infectious and overall complication rates, with a longer postoperative hospital stay. Among the cultured bacteriae from infected sites in BT group patients with infectious complications, only 2 patients (12.5%) had totally different bacterial species to those cultured from MLNs. CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial translocation more often occurred after liver resection in cirrhotic patients who received intraoperative blood transfusion. Such patients had higher postoperative infectious and overall complication rates. Thus, avoidance of intraoperative blood transfusion is mandatory for cirrhotic liver resection.
TI  - The influence of inadequate empirical antimicrobial treatment on patients with bloodstream infections in an intensive care unit.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the occurrence of inadequate antimicrobial therapy among  critically ill patients with bacteremia and the factors associated with it, to identify the microorganisms that received inadequate antimicrobial treatment, and to determine the relationship between inadequate treatment and patients outcome. METHODS: From June 1995 to January 1999 we collected data on all clinically significant ICU-bacteremias in our teaching hospital. Clinical and microbiological characteristics were recorded and the adequacy of empirical antimicrobial treatment in each case was determined. We defined inappropriate empirical antimicrobial treatment as applying to infection that was not being effectively treated at the time the causative microorganism and its antibiotic susceptibility were known. Multivariate analysis was used to determine the variables associated with inappropriate empirical antimicrobial treatment and to evaluate the influence of this on the related mortality to bacteremia, using the SPSS package (9.0). RESULTS: Among 166 intensive care unit patients with bacteremia, 39 (23.5%) received inadequate antimicrobial treatment. In this last group the mean age of patients was 64.1 +/- 13.2 years, and 64% were men. Bacteremia was hospital-acquired in 92% of these cases. Eleven percent developed septic shock and 37.7% severe sepsis, and ultimately fatal underlying disease was present in 28.2% of patients given inadequate empirical antimicrobial treatment. The main sources of bacteremias in this group were: a vascular catheter (15.3%), respiratory (7.6%) or unknown (53.8%). The microorganisms most frequently isolated in the group with inadequate empirical antimicrobial treatment were: coagulase-negative staphylococci (29.5%), Acinetobacter baumannii (27.3%), Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, and Candida species (4.5% each). The frequency of coagulase-negative staphylococci in the cases with inappropriate treatment was higher than in the group with appropriate treatment (OR 2.62; 95% CI: 1.10-6.21; P = 0.015). The global mortality rate was 56% and the related mortality was 30% in the group with inadequate empirical antimicrobial treatment. The only factor associated with inappropriate empirical antibiotic treatment was the absence of abdominal or respiratory focus (P = 0.04; OR = 0.35; 95% CI: 0.12-0.97). Septic shock was related to attributable mortality (P = 0.03; OR = 3.19; 95% CI: 1.08-9.40), but not inappropriate empirical antibiotic treatment (P = 0.24; OR = 1.71; 95% CI: 0.66-4.78). CONCLUSION: Almost a quarter of critically ill patients with bloodstream infections were given inadequate empirical antibiotic treatment, but mortality was not higher in the group with inadequate treatment than in the group with adequate treatment. This fact was probably due to microbiological factors and clinical features, such as the type of microorganism most frequently isolated and the source of the bacteremia.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of lactose-binding lectins from Bufo arenarum skin.
AB  - Amphibians respond to microbial infection through cellular and humoral defense mechanisms such as antimicrobial protein secretion. Most humoral defense proteins are synthetized in the skin. In this study we isolated two beta-galactoside-binding lectins with molecular weights of 50 and 56 KDa from the skin of Bufo arenarum. These lectins have significant hemagglutination activity against trypsinized rabbit erythrocytes, which was inhibited by galactose-containing saccharides. They are water-soluble and independent of the presence of calcium. The antimicrobial analysis for each lectin was performed. At mumolar concentration lectins show strong bacteriostatic activity against Gram negative bacteria (Escherichia coli K12 4100 and wild strains of Escherichia coli and Proteus morganii) and Gram positive bacteria (Enterococcus faecalis). The antibacterial activity of these lectins may provide an effective defense against invading microbes in the amphibian Bufo arenarum.
TI  - In vitro activity of piperacillin/tazobactam and other broad-spectrum antibiotics against bacteria from hospitalised patients in the British Isles.
AB  - Piperacillin/tazobactam is used for empirical therapy of severe and complex infections. We assessed its activity, 9 years after launch, against consecutive, clinically significant isolates from in-patients in UK and Ireland. Standardised disc susceptibility tests were performed on 5031 isolates at 28 hospitals. For quality assurance purposes, 5% of these isolates were collected centrally for MIC tests, as were those with exceptional resistances. Compared with a similar pre-launch survey in 1991, there were major increases in the proportions of Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, beta-haemolytic streptococci and Enterococcus faecium isolates collected, balanced by decreases in Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and coagulase-negative staphylococci. These changes in species prevalence mostly favoured organisms with inherent resistance(s) or-in the case of S. aureus-reflected the massive increase of MRSA, up from 0.7% of all isolates in 1991 to 14.8% in 2001. Based on the disc tests, piperacillin/tazobactam retained activity against 87% of Enterobacteriaceae isolates, 95% of P. aeruginosa, 99% of streptococci and 96% of Enterococcus faecalis. Resistance nevertheless had increased since 1991 in E. coli from 4 to 10%, Klebsiella spp. (5 to 21%) and in AmpC-inducible Enterobacteriaceae (17 to 23%), though not in P. mirabilis or P. aeruginosa. MIC tests confirmed most of the piperacillin/tazobactam resistance found by disc tests in Enterobacter spp., but indicated susceptibility for about half of the E. coli isolates recorded as resistant in disc tests. This situation might be remedied by reducing the zone breakpoint, but this would increase the "false susceptible" rate unacceptably. Thus, if disc tests suggest that an isolate is marginally resistant to piperacillin/tazobactam and the drug is sought as therapy, it is recommended that MIC be determined with, e.g., an Etest.
TI  - Effects of carbon dioxide on bacterial growth parameters in milk as measured by conductivity.
AB  - Inhibition of bacterial growth by dissolved carbon dioxide (CO2) has been well established in many foods including dairy foods. However, the effects of dissolved CO2 on specific growth parameters such as length of lag phase, time to maximum growth rate, and numbers of organisms at the stationary phase have not been quantified for organisms of concern in milk. The effect of dissolved CO2 concentrations of 0.6 to 61.4 mM on specific bacterial growth parameters in raw or single organism inoculated sterile milk was determined at 15 degrees C by conductance. Commingled raw or sterile milks were amended to a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml each of urea and arginine HCl. Sterile milks were inoculated singly with one of six different microorganisms to a final concentration of approximately 10(2) to 10(3) cfu/ml; raw milk was adjusted to a final indigenous bacterial population of approximately 10(3) cfu/ml. Conductivity of the milk was recorded every 60 s over 4 to 5 d in a circulating apparatus at 15 degrees C. Conductivity values were fit to Gompertz equations and growth parameters calculated. Conductance correlated with plate counts and was satisfactory for monitoring microbial growth. Data fit the Gompertz equation with high correlation (R2 = 0.96 to 1.00). In all cases, dissolved CO2 significantly inhibited growth of raw milk bacteria, influencing lag, exponential, and stationary growth phases as well as all tested monocultures.
TI  - Intergeneric transfer of the Enterococcus faecalis plasmid pIP501 to Escherichia  coli and Streptomyces lividans and sequence analysis of its tra region.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of the transfer (tra) region of the multiresistance broad-host-range Inc18 plasmid pIP501 was completed. The 8629-bp DNA sequence encodes 10 open reading frames (orf), 9 of them are possibly involved in pIP501 conjugative transfer. The putative pIP501 tra gene products show highest similarity to the respective ORFs of the conjugative Enterococcus faecalis plasmids pRE25 and pAMbeta1, and the Streptococcus pyogenes plasmid pSM19035, respectively. ORF7 and ORF10 encode putative homologues of type IV secretion systems involved in transport of effector molecules from pathogens to host cells and in conjugative plasmid transfer in Gram-negative (G-) bacteria. pIP501 mobilized non-selftransmissible plasmids such as pMV158 between different E. faecalis strains and from E. faecalis to Bacillus subtilis. Evidence for the very broad-host-range of pIP501 was obtained by intergeneric conjugative transfer of pIP501 to a multicellular Gram-positive (G+) bacterium, Streptomyces lividans, and to G- Escherichia coli. We proved for the first time pIP501 replication, expression of its antibiotic resistance genes as well as functionality of the pIP501 tra genes in S. lividans and E. coli.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and its susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents--special references to bacteria isolated between April 2001 and March 2002].
AB  - Isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery during the period from April 2001 to March 2002 were investigated in a multicenter study in Japan, and the following results were obtained. In this series, four hundred and twenty strains were isolated from 175 (79.2%) of 221 patients with surgical infections. One hundred and eighty-six strains were isolated from primary infections, and 234 strains were isolated from postoperative infections. From primary infections, anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant, while from postoperative infections, aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant. Among aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, although the isolation rate of Staphylococcus aureus was the highest, followed by that of Enterococcus faecalis from primary infections, the isolation rate of E. faecalis was the highest from postoperative infections. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Peptostreptococcus spp. was the highest from both types of infections. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in this order, and from postoperative infections, P. aeruginosa was the most predominantly isolated, followed by Enterobacter spp., E. coli and Klebsiella spp. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of Bacteroides fragilis group was the highest from both types of infections. The isolation rate of aerobic Gram-negative bacteria from primary infections and that of aerobic Gram-positive bacteria from postoperative infections were high in the last several years. We noticed no vancomycin-resistant Gram-positive cocci.
TI  - Field trials on the prophylaxis of intramammary infections in pregnant heifers.
AB  - The study was carried out in 5 farms on 174 pregnant heifers. Clinical examination of the udder and bacteriological tests of quarter secretion were performed between the 8th and 3rd week before parturition, and then the animals were divided into a control group (64 heifers) and 3 experimental groups and immediately treated. A group of 32 experimental heifers was injected once with antioxidants (Vitamin A--600,000 i.u.; Vitamin D3--200,000 i.u.; Vitamin E--1.5 mg/kg b.w., Selenium--0.022 mg/kg b.w., i.m.). The next group (26 heads) was intramammary infused with antibiotic DC product (cloxacillin). Heifers from last experimental group (52) were injected with lysosyme dimer in a single dose of 0.02 mg/kg b.w. Clinical and bacteriological examinations were made during the first week after calving. The presence of bacteria was found in secretion of 22.6-38.9% udder quarters in 56.2-71.2% of pregnant heifers. The number of infected quarters (cows) did not change distinctly in the first week after calving except the lysozyme dimer group, where a decrease by 30% was noted. The percentage of quarters with elevated somatic cell count was higher in antibiotic DC group and closely similar in the other groups. None of examined methods showed an acceptable prophylactic effect. Clinical mastitis cases during first week after parturition were mostly caused by Escherichia coli, Staph. chromogenes, Staph. simulans, Staph. aureus, Staph. hyicus, Str. uberis, Str. acidominimus and Enterococcus faecalis.
TI  - Long-lived C. elegans daf-2 mutants are resistant to bacterial pathogens.
AB  
TI  - Pharmacokinetics and tissue penetration of pefloxacin plus metronidazole after administration as surgical prophylaxis in colorectal surgery.
AB  - The levels of metronidazole and pefloxacin in plasma and tissue penetration of both drugs were studied after prophylactic administration to 7 patients undergoing colorectal surgery. Metronidazole (1,500 mg) and pefloxacin (800 mg) were administered as an intravenous infusion 1 hour before surgery. Mean plasma levels of pefloxacin decreased from 12.92 +/- 4.10 microg/ml at the end of the infusion to 2.18 +/- 1.03 microg/ml at 36 h. These values were above the MIC90 for E. coli (0.125 microg/ml) and E. faecalis (0.5 microg/ml), microorganisms responsible for abdominal infections. Tissue pefloxacin levels were also measured with a range from 0.72 - 7.78 microg/g in subcutaneous cell tissue, from 1.94 - 17.55 microg/g in peritoneum and from 2.76 - 21.99 microg/g in colon wall. Mean plasma concentrations of metronidazole decreased from 39.89 +/- 17.08 microg/ml at the end of the infusion to 2.63 +/- 1.11 microg/ml at 36 h. During this period, concentrations were higher than 2 microg/ml, the MIC90 value for B. fragilis, the anaerobic pathogen more frequently involved in postoperative infections after rectal and colonic surgery. Tissue metronidazole levels ranged from 3.64 - 13.37 microg/g in subcutaneous cell tissue, from 3.26 - 41.66 microg/g in peritoneum and from 6.72 - 43.12 microg/g in colon wall. The AUC/MIC values (efficacy parameter for concentration-dependent killing antibiotics such as pefloxacin and metronidazole) obtained were the following: metronidazole AUC/MIC value for B. fragilis was 173; pefloxacin AUC/MIC values for E. coli and E. faecalis were 941 and 235, respectively. The values of these parameters are higher than the recommended values to ensure efficacy, which means good exposure of the antimicrobials to the microorganisms. In conclusion, the combination of pefloxacin and metronidazole as prophylactic agents to prevent infections in patients undergoing colorectal surgery produce plasma and tissue levels above the MIC values of the main pathogens responsible for this kind of infections.
TI  - Quorum sensing and expression of virulence in Escherichia coli O157:H7.
AB  - Enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7 causes a characteristic histopathology in intestinal cells known as attaching and effacing lesion. The genes for the lesion are encoded by the Locus of Enterocyte Effacement (LEE) pathogenicity island, that encodes a type III secretion system, the intimin intestinal colonization factor, and the translocated intimin receptor protein that is translocated from the bacterium to the host epithelial cells. Expression of the operons encoded within LEE is complex, but recent studies have demonstrated that quorum sensing influences transcription from four of the LEE operon promoters. A transcriptional regulator (LuxR homologue), signal synthase (LuxI homologue), and autoinducer (acylhomoserine lactone) are indispensable for this system in most gram-negative bacteria. Vibrio harveyi, a gram-negative bioluminescent marine bacterium, regulates light production in response to two autoinducers (AI-1 and AI-2). AI-1 is a homoserine lactone produced by most gram-negative bacteria. The structure of AI-2 is not known, but many species of gram positive and gram-negative bacteria, including E. coli and more specifically O157:H7, have been shown to produce AI-2 depending on the function encoded by the luxS gene. The LuxS acts as an AI-2 synthase and the AI-2 is produced from S-adenosylmethionine in three enzymatic steps. The substrate for LuxS is S-ribosylhomocysteine, which is cleaved to form two products, one of which is homocysteine, and the other is AI-2. The biosynthetic pathways and the biochemical intermediates in AI-2 biosynthesis have been observed to be identical in several gram-negative bacteria, such as E. coli, Salmonella typhimurium, V. harveyi, Vibrio cholerae, and Enterococcus faecalis. Thus, unlike quorum sensing via the family of related homoserine autoinducers, AI-2 is a universal signal, which may be used by a variety of bacteria for communication among and between species and may be responsible for regulation of virulence genes in E. coli O157:H7.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance in animals.
AB  - There is currently no systematic surveillance or monitoring of antibiotic resistance in Australian animals. Registration of antibiotics for use in animals is tightly controlled and has been very conservative. Fluoroquinolones have not been registered for use in food producing animals and other products have been removed from the market because of human health concerns. In the late 1970s, the Animal Health Committee coordinated a survey of resistance in Salmonella and Escherichia coli isolates from cattle, pigs and poultry and in bovine Staphylococcus aureus. Some additional information is available from published case reports. In samples collected prior to the withdrawal of avoparcin from the market, no vancomycin resistant Enterococcus faecium or Enterococcus faecalis were detected in samples collected from pigs, whereas some vanA enterococci, including E. faecium and E. faecalis, were found in chickens. No vanB enterococci were detected in either species. Virginiamycin resistance was common in both pig and poultry isolates. Multiple resistance was common in E. coli and salmonellae isolates. No fluoroquinolone resistance was found in salmonellae, E. coli or Campylobacter. Beta-lactamase production is common in isolates from bovine mastitis, but no methicillin resistance has been detected. However, methicillin resistance has been reported in canine isolates of Staphylococcus intermedius and extended spectrum beta-lactamase producing E. coli has been found in dogs.
TI  - Decontamination of seeds for seed sprout production by high hydrostatic pressure.
AB  - Garden cress, sesame, radish, and mustard seeds immersed in water were treated with high pressure (250, 300, 350, and 400 MPa) for 15 min at 20 degrees C. After treatment, percentages of seeds germinating on water agar were recorded for up to 11 days. Of the seeds tested, radish seeds were found to be the most pressure sensitive, with seeds treated at 250 MPa reaching 100% germination 9 days later than untreated control seeds did. Garden cress seeds, on the other hand, were the most pressure resistant, with seeds treated at 250 MPa reaching 100% germination 1 day later than untreated control seeds did. Garden cress sprouts from seeds treated at 250 and 300 MPa also took about 1 day longer to reach average sprout length than sprouts from untreated control seeds did, indicating that sprout growth was not retarded once germination had occurred. Garden cress seeds were inoculated with suspensions of seven different bacteria (10(7) CFU/ml) and processed with high pressure. Treatment at 300 MPa (15 min, 20 degrees C) resulted in 6-log reductions of Salmonella Typhimurium, Escherichia coli MG1655, and Listeria innocua, > 4-log reductions of Shigella flexneri and pressure-resistant E. coli LMM1010, and a 2-log reduction of Staphylococcus aureus. Enterococcus faecalis was virtually not inactivated. For suspensions of the gram-positive bacteria, similar levels of inactivation in water in the absence of garden cress seeds were found, but the inactivation of E. coil LMM1010 and S. flexneri in water in the absence of garden cress seeds was significantly less extensive. These data suggest that garden cress seeds contain a component that acts synergistically with high hydrostatic pressure against gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Development of a thermally regulated broad-spectrum promoter system for use in pathogenic gram-positive species.
AB  - Selectively regulating gene expression is an essential molecular tool that is lacking for many pathogenic gram-positive bacteria. In this report, we describe the evaluation of a series of promoters regulated by the bacteriophage P1 temperature-sensitive C1 repressor in Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus aureus. Using the lacZ gene to monitor gene expression, we examined the strength, basal expression, and induced expression of synthetic promoters carrying C1 operator sites. The promoters exhibited extremely low basal expression and, under inducing conditions, gave high levels of expression (100- to 1,000-fold induction). We demonstrate that the promoter system could be modulated by temperature and showed rapid induction and that the mechanism of regulation occurred at the level of transcription. Controlled expression with the same constructs was also demonstrated in the gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli. However, low basal expression and the ability to achieve derepression were dependent on both the number of mismatches in the C1 operator sites and the promoter driving c1 expression. Since the promoters were designed to contain conserved promoter elements from gram-positive species and were constructed in a broad-host-range plasmid, this system will provide a new opportunity for controlled gene expression in a variety of gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Screening of anti-bacterial activity of medicinal plants from Belize (Central America).
AB  - Twenty-one extracts from seven herbal drugs, Aristolochia trilobata (Aristolochiaceae) leaves and bark, Bursera simaruba (Burseraceae) bark, Guazuma ulmifolia (Sterculiaceae) bark, Hamelia patens (Rubiaceae) leaves and Syngonium podophyllum (Araceae) leaves and bark, used in traditional medicine of Belize (Central America) as deep and superficial wound healers, were evaluated for their anti-bacterial properties. Activity was tested against standard strains of Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 and Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212. Almost all the extracts were able to inhibit the growth of one or more of the bacterial strains, except that of Enterococcus faecalis. For the first time an anti-microbial activity is reported for Aristolochia trilobata as well as for Syngonium podophyllum. The hexane extracts of Aristolochia trilobata leaves and bark were the most active extracts against Staphylococcus aureus (MIC=0.31 and 0.625mg/ml, respectively).
TI  - Characterization of Escherichia coli strains causing urinary tract infections in  patients with transposed intestinal segments.
AB  - PURPOSE: Transposition of intestinal segments into the urinary tract predisposes  to urinary tract infections. We characterized bacterial infections in these patients and examined the virulence genotype and persistence of Escherichia coli isolates. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We followed 26 patients who underwent bladder reconstructive surgery using transposed intestinal segments. E. coli strains isolated from the urine of these patients were genotyped for established virulence determinants and the frequency of carriage was compared with E. coli strains isolated from community acquired urinary infections and the fecal flora of anonymous volunteers. A longitudinal study of E. coli strains in 9 patients was also done using pulsed field gel electrophoresis. RESULTS: E. coli was the most frequently isolated organism, responsible for 59% (62 of 105) of monobacterial infections. Other bacteria isolated included Klebsiella species, Proteus species and Enterococcus faecalis. Community acquired E. coli strains were more likely to carry multiple determinants for particular adhesins (P and S fimbriae) and toxins (alpha-hemolysin and cytotoxic necrotizing factor) than fecal strains. Carriage frequency for bladder reconstruction strains was intermediary and not significantly different. The key finding was that E. coli strains persisted for prolonged periods, including 2 years in certain patients, often despite various antimicrobial treatments. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights that further steps must be taken to prevent and treat urinary tract infections in this susceptible group. Particular attention should be given to the treatment of persistent infections.
TI  - Synthesis, antibacterial and antifungal activities of electron-rich olefins derived benzimidazole compounds.
AB  - New benzimidazole derivatives were synthesised by electron-rich olefines (7, 8 and 9) with appropriate reagents. The compounds synthesised were identified by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, FT-IR spectroscopic techniques and elemental analysis. All compounds studied in this work were screened for their in vitro antimicrobial activities against the standard strains: Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29212), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 29213), Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853) and the yeasts Candida albicans and Candida tropicalis. Eleven of the compounds inhibited the growth of gram-positive bacteria (E. faecalis and S. aureus) at MIC values between 50 and 400 microg/ml. None of the compounds exhibit antimicrobial activity against Gram-negative bacteria (E. coli and P. Aeruginosa) at the concentrations studied (6.25-800 microg/ml). Nine of the tested compounds showed an antifungal activity with a range of the MICs between 50 and 400 microg/ml.
TI  - [Value and justification of urine dip-sticks in the diagnosis of postoperative urinary infections in urology].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the diagnostic value of urine dip-sticks for postoperative urinary tract infections. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A prospective study was performed on 165 patients undergoing radical prostatectomy, open prostatectomy for BPH or transurethral resection of the prostate or bladder. Postoperative bacteriuria was investigated by using Multistix urine dip-sticks and was verified by urine culture. The presence of nitrites was the only parameter of the dip-stick taken into account. RESULTS: The overall infection rate was 9.7% (range: 7.3% to 16%). The dip-stick showed extremely poor sensitivity and specificity of 36.3% and 57.8%, respectively (p = 0.03). The main bacterial species isolated were: Escherichia coli (63%) and Enterococcus faecalis (27%). CONCLUSION: The lack of diagnostic reliability of urine dip-sticks no longer justifies the use of these tests for the diagnosis of postoperative infection. Urine culture, with documented efficacy, remains the reference examination.
TI  - In vitro activities of linezolid combined with other antimicrobial agents against Staphylococci, Enterococci, Pneumococci, and selected gram-negative organisms.
AB  - The activities of linezolid, an oxazolidinone antibacterial agent active against  gram-positive organisms, alone and in combination with 35 antimicrobial agents were tested in vitro against methicillin-sensitive (n = 1 to 2 strains) and methicillin-resistant (n = 8 to 10) Staphylococcus aureus strains; vancomycin-sensitive (n = 6) and vancomycin-resistant (n = 6 to 8) Enterococcus faecalis strains; vancomycin-sensitive (n = 5) and vancomycin-resistant (n = 6) Enterococcus faecium strains; penicillin-sensitive (n = 2 to 5), penicillin-intermediate (n = 5 to 6), and penicillin-resistant (n = 5 to 6) Streptococcus pneumoniae strains; Escherichia coli (n = 6); and Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 6). The fractional inhibitory concentration indices of linezolid in combination with other antimicrobial agents for the organisms tested were generated on checkerboard broth microdilution plates prepared by a semiautomated method. Of 1,380 organism-drug combinations, 1,369 (99.2%) combinations of linezolid with 28 antimicrobial drugs were indifferent, 9 combinations (0.65%) of linezolid with 6 drugs (amoxicillin, erythromycin, imipenem, sparfloxacin, teicoplanin, and tetracycline) were synergistic, and 2 combinations (0.15%) of linezolid with 2 drugs (ofloxacin and sparfloxacin) were antagonistic. Overall, the in vitro data demonstrated that linezolid combined with other antimicrobial agents primarily produces an indifferent response, with infrequent occurrences of synergism and antagonism.
TI  - Escherichia coli 83972 inhibits catheter adherence by a broad spectrum of uropathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The presence of a nonpathogenic organism on the surface of a urinary  catheter might impede catheter colonization by pathogens and thus prevent urinary tract infection. Previously, we reported that preinoculating urinary catheters with a nonpathogenic strain of Escherichia coli (83972) significantly impeded catheter colonization in vitro by gram-positive bacteria (Enterococcus faecalis). To explore this phenomenon further, we investigated in vitro whether E. coli 83972 could likewise inhibit catheter colonization by gram-negative and fungal uropathogens (Providencia stuartii, uropathogenic E. coli, and Candida albicans). METHODS: For each of the three uropathogens tested, we examined three different incubation conditions: (a) E. coli plus uropathogen catheters were exposed to E. coli 83972 for 24 hours and then to a uropathogen for 30 minutes; (b) E. coli-alone catheters were incubated with E. coli for 24 hours and then in sterile broth for 30 minutes; and (c) uropathogen-alone catheters were incubated in sterile broth for 24 hours before the 30-minute incubation with the uropathogen. All catheters were subsequently incubated in sterile human urine for 24 hours. Catheters were then rinsed and sonicated to determine the numbers of adherent organisms per centimeter. RESULTS: Pre-exposure of the catheter to E. coli 83972 in all cases significantly reduced the number of uropathogens colonizing the catheter surfaces. CONCLUSIONS: E. coli 83972 significantly impedes catheter colonization by all tested bacterial and fungal pathogens. The broad applicability of this particular approach to bacterial interference in vitro invites further exploration in vivo.
TI  - Drug resistance amongst uropathogens isolated from women in a suburban population: laboratory findings over 7 years.
AB  - Urinary tract infections (UTI) are a common reason for patient visits to the family physician. The following study was carried out during one month in 1989 and one month in 1996, whereby urine specimens from adult females (living in suburban areas of Toronto, Canada), with presumed signs and symptoms of UTI, were processed. The pool of 20 infecting uropathogenic species was relatively unaltered over the seven years. Most isolates were Gram negative pathogens (72% in 1989; 76% in 1996), with Escherichia coli the most common (56.5% in 1989; 61.9%, in 1996), followed by Enterococcus faecalis (17.4% in 1989; 9.47% in 1996). The resistance to commonly prescribed trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole increased during the seven years from 10% to 15%, for E. coli (Table 2) and from 35% to 100% for enterococci (Table 3). In 1996, although there was resistance to norfloxacin, the top five uropathogenic species were highly susceptible. No enterococci were resistant to nitrofurantoin and almost all E. coli (99.2%) were susceptible. Based upon this in-vitro data, nitrofurantoin, and not trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, would be the antimicrobial agent of choice for treatment of uncomplicated UTI in adult females.
TI  - Chlorination of indicator bacteria and viruses in primary sewage effluent.
AB  - Wastewater disinfection is used in many countries for reducing fecal coliform levels in effluents. Disinfection is therefore frequently used to improve recreational bathing waters which do not comply with microbiological standards. It is unknown whether human enteric viruses (which are responsible for waterborne disease) are simultaneously inactivated alongside fecal coliforms. This laboratory study focused on the chlorination of primary treated effluent with three doses (8, 16, and 30 mg/liter) of free chlorine as sodium hypochlorite. Seeding experiments showed that inactivation (>5 log(10) units) of Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis was rapid and complete but that there was poor inactivation (0.2 to 1.0 log(10) unit) of F(+)-specific RNA (FRNA) bacteriophage (MS2) (a potential virus indicator) at all three doses. However, seeded poliovirus was significantly more susceptible (2.8 log(10) units) to inactivation by chlorine than was the FRNA bacteriophage. To ensure that these results were not artifacts of the seeding process, comparisons were made between inactivation rates of laboratory-seeded organisms in sterilized sewage and inactivation rates of organisms occurring naturally in sewage. Multifactorial analysis of variance showed that there was no significant difference (P > 0.05) between the inactivation rates for seeded and naturally occurring FRNA bacteriophage. However, laboratory-grown poliovirus was inactivated much more rapidly than were naturally occurring, indigenous enteroviruses (P < 0.001). This may reflect differences in the way indigenous virus is presented to the disinfectant. Inactivation rates for indigenous enteroviruses were quite similar to those seen for FRNA bacteriophage at lower doses of chlorine. These results have significance for the effectiveness of chlorination as a sewage treatment process, particularly where virus contamination is of concern, and suggest that FRNA bacteriophage would be an appropriate indicator of such viral inactivation under field conditions.
TI  - Purification, crystallization and preliminary X-ray analysis of the Enterococcus  faecalis protein EF0377.
AB  - The EF0377 gene of Enterococcus faecalis was cloned and overexpressed in Escherichia coli. The protein has been purified and crystallized in three forms. Type III crystals belong to space group P2(1), with unit-cell parameters a = 72.11, b = 94.97, c = 80.77 A, beta = 111.93 degrees. There are four molecules per asymmetric unit and diffraction is observed to beyond 1.65 A under cryoconditions (100 K) using synchrotron radiation. An almost complete set of X-ray diffraction data was collected to 1.9 A from the native crystal.
TI  - Crystal structure of Enterococcus faecalis SlyA-like transcriptional factor.
AB  - The crystal structure of a SlyA transcriptional regulator at 1.6 A resolution is  presented, and structural relationships between members of the MarR/SlyA family are discussed. The SlyA family, which includes SlyA, Rap, Hor, and RovA proteins, is widely distributed in bacterial and archaeal genomes. Current evidence suggests that SlyA-like factors act as repressors, activators, and modulators of gene transcription. These proteins have been shown to up-regulate the expression of molecular chaperones, acid-resistance proteins, and cytolysin, and down-regulate several biosynthetic enzymes. The structure of SlyA from Enterococcus faecalis, determined as a part of an ongoing structural genomics initiative (www.mcsg.anl.gov), revealed the same winged helix DNA-binding motif that was recently found in the MarR repressor from Escherichia coli and the MexR repressor from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a sequence homologue of MarR. Phylogenetic analysis of the MarR/SlyA family suggests that Sly is placed between the SlyA and MarR subfamilies and shows significant sequence similarity to members of both subfamilies.
TI  - The significance of sunlight for the elimination of indicator bacteria in small-scale bathing ponds in central Europe.
AB  - In order to determine the impact of sunlight on the reduction rate of indicator bacteria, bathing waters of different turbidity were artificially contaminated with indicator bacteria and exposed to sunlight. The reduction rates determined for the indicator bacteria showed a significant correlation with radiation intensity and, thus, also the time of day as well as the turbidity of the water. Under conditions of strong radiation intensity and low water turbidity (< 5 FTU), indicator bacteria were eliminated within 1-2 h of contamination with an initial concentration of 10(5) CFU/mL. Moreover, differences between different indicator bacteria were found. Enterococcus faecalis proved to be significantly more resistant to sunlight than the other indicator bacteria tested (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus). The results of the present study, namely the complete elimination of indicator bacteria within a few hours, showed that sunlight, given an appropriate intensity and good water transparency, was the most important factor in the reduction of hygienically-relevant microorganisms in surface waters and, thus, also in small-scale bathing ponds.
TI  - Meconium enhances the growth of perinatal bacterial pathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the effects of meconium on growth of bacterial pathogens, which are common causes of intra-amniotic infection and neonatal sepsis. METHODS: Meconium collected from 9 healthy neonates was suspended as a 20% solution using sterile saline. In experiment 1, separate test tubes of meconium solution and sterile saline (the control) were individually inoculated with 10(6) colony-forming units of a single species of the following test pathogens: Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Group B Streptococcus, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Listeria monocytogenes. After incubation at 37 degree C for 24 hours, 1 L each of the bacterial-meconium and bacterial-saline solutions was inoculated onto 5% sheep blood agar. After 24 hours of incubation, the number of developing colonies was counted. In experiment 2, equal volumes of meconium and saline solutions were inoculated with 10(5) colony-forming units of either E. coli or Group B Streptococcus. At intervals of 6, 9, and 24 hours post-incubation, 1 L each of the bacterial-meconium and bacterial-saline solutions was inoculated onto 5% sheep blood agar plates, and colonies were counted after overnight incubation. RESULTS: In the first experiment, 24 hours of incubation resulted in bacterial amplification in the meconium solution from an initial inoculum of 10(6) colony-forming units/mL to 10(9) colony-forming units/mL. In contrast, the same inoculation of saline solution (control) showed no increase in colony counts over the same time interval. For E. coli and Group B Streptococcus in experiment 2, growth enhancement in meconium was seen as early as 6 hours, as colony counts of a test species increased from 105 colony-forming units/mL to 10(9)-10(10) colony-forming units/mL. CONCLUSION: Enhanced growth of perinatal pathogens in meconium was constantly observed, and can occur as early as 6 hours after bacterial interaction of meconium.
TI  - A UK multicentre study of the antimicrobial susceptibility of bacterial pathogens causing urinary tract infection.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence of resistance amongst urinary tract pathogens against antimicrobials used to treat urinary tract infections (UTIs) in the UK to provide data to help direct empirical therapy. METHOD: During 1999-2000, a total of 1291 bacterial isolates causing UTI were collected from 8 centres in the UK. Isolates were cultured from patients with (1). community-acquired UTI in those less than 65 years old (397), (2). hospital-acquired UTI other than those admitted with pyelonephritis (394), (3). pyelonephritis (108) and (4). community-acquired UTI in those greater than 65 years old (392). After re-identification, MICs for a range of antimicrobials were determined and interpreted using NCCLS procedures and interpretive guidelines. RESULTS: Escherichia coli was the predominant pathogen in all categories but the total percentage for each category varied (56.3-77.3%). The next three pathogens of importance were Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis which varied in prevalence slightly from category to category. The activity of amoxycillin against E. coli (51.3% susceptible) was greatly reduced as a result of beta-lactamase production and only partially restored by the addition of clavulanic acid (78.8% susceptible). Cefuroxime was very active against E. coli using parenteral form breakpoints (97.1% susceptible) but less so using oral form breakpoints (68.6% susceptible). Cefuroxime was inactive against Enterococcus spp. and Pseudomonas spp. Nitrofurantoin was very active against isolates of E. coli (96.3% susceptible) and E. faecalis but not against K. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Overall susceptibility to trimethoprim ranged from 58.1% to 84.5% for the most prevalent pathogens. Ciprofloxacin was highly active against the UTI pathogens examined in this study with susceptibilities of between 88.6% and 97.7% for the most prevalent pathogens (E. coli, n=864, 97.7% susceptible) and was the only oral agent tested with activity against Pseudomonas spp. CONCLUSION: These data provide much needed information on the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance amongst pathogens currently causing UTI in the UK.
TI  - [In vitro antibacterial activity of prulifloxacin, a new oral fluoroquinolone].
AB  - We compared antibacterial activity of NM394, which is the active metabolite of a  prodrug of new fluoroquinolone prulifloxacin (PUFX), against clinical isolates of bacteria with those of ciprofloxacin (CPFX), levofloxacin (LVFX), gatifloxacin (GFLX), tosufloxacin (TFLX) and fleroxacin (FLRX). 1. NM394 showed a broad-spectrum antibacterial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. 2. MIC80 of NM394 for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Enterococcus faecalis were 0.5 microgram/ml, 2 micrograms/ml and 4 micrograms/ml, respectively. MIC80 of NM394 for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae was lower than 0.06 microgram/ml. MIC80 of NM394 for Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were 0.25 microgram/ml and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. 3. Short-time bactericidal activity of NM394 against P. aeruginosa was stronger than those of CPFX, GFLX, LVFX and TFLX. 4. Short-time bactericidal activity of NM394 at Cmax concentration against 12 strains of P. aeruginosa was stronger than those of CPFX, LVFX, GFLX and TFLX.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents--special references to bacteria isolated between April 2000 and March 2001].
AB  - Tendency of isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery and their antimicrobial susceptibilities during the period from April 2000 to March 2001 were investigated in a multicenter study in Japan, and the following results were obtained. The number of cases investigated as objectives was 234 for one year. A total of 388 strains (136 strains from primary infections and 252 strains from postoperative infections) were isolated from 165 cases (70.5% of total cases). In primary infections, anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant, while from postoperative infections, aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant. Among aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Enterococcus faecalis was the highest, followed by that of Staphylococcus aureus from postoperative infections. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Peptostreptococcus spp. was the highest from both types of infections. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in this order, and from postoperative infections, P. aeruginosa was the most predominantly isolated, followed by Enterobacter spp. and Klebsiella spp. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of Bacteroides fragilis group was the highest from both types of infections. There was no vancomycin-resistant S. aureus nor Enterococcus spp. Among anaerobic bacteria, there were many resistant strains against penicillins and cephems with MICs higher than 100 micrograms/ml, and the same trend was observed among other Bacteroides spp. and Prevotella spp.
TI  - Microbiology of choledochal bile in patients with choledocholithiasis admitted to a tertiary hospital.
AB  - AIM: The present study was designed to investigate the microbiology of choledochal bile of patients with cholangitis and choledocholithiasis. METHODS: We identified and determined the antimicrobial susceptibility of bacteria isolated in the bile of patients with cholangitis and choledocholithiasis diagnosed by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). RESULTS: Nineteen (82.6%) of 23 patients with choledocholithiasis had positive bile cultures. A single agent was detected in 11 patients (57.9%), while a mixed growth, with pathogens ranging from two to three species, were seen in eight patients (42.1%). Patients with clinical manifestations of cholangitis had significantly higher counts of colonies per mL of bile (> 105 cfu/mL). The predominant Gram-negative aerobic bacteria isolated were Escherichia coli (9, 31.0%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (5, 17.2%), Enterobacter cloacae (2, 6.9%), Pantoea agglomerans (1, 3.4%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1, 3.4%). The predominant Gram-positive bacteria were Enterococcus faecalis (5, 17.2%) and Streptococcus sp. (5, 17.2%). Bacteroides fragilis was isolated in one patient with mixed growth. All Gram-positive bacteria isolated in bile were sensitive to ampicillin, and all Gram-negative bacteria isolated were sensitive to gentamicin with a minimum inhibitory concentration (CIM90) ranging from 0.5 to 1.0- micro g/mL. Gram-negative bacteria were also sensitive to imipenem, fluorquinolones, second and third generation cephalosporins. Although all five isolates of E. faecalis were sensitive to ampicillin, two of five (40%) E. faecalis isolates demonstrated high levels of resistance to gentamicin. CONCLUSION: E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. faecalis and Streptoccocus sp. were the most common bacteria isolated in the bile of patients with cholangitis and choledocholithiasis, which were sensitive to a simple therapeutic regimen, such as the combination of ampicilin and gentamicin.
TI  - [Antimicrobial susceptibility and beta-lactamase productivity of recent clinical  isolates during the period between December 1999 and February 2000].
AB  - Antimicrobial susceptibility testings of 24 antimicrobial agents against 605 clinical strains belonging to 10 species were carried out according to the micro-broth dilution method of NCCLS M7-A4. The productivity of beta-lactamase was also determined against them isolated at 8 medical facilities in Nagano prefecture, Japan during the period between December 1999 and February 2000. When applied the nitrocefin method, beta-lactamase productivity was demonstrated to be positive for 89.2% of 74 S. aureus, 4.3% of 94 H. influenzae, and 100% of 69 M. (B.) catarrhalis isolates. On the other hand, when used the acidometry method, penicillinase/cephalosporinase were found to be positive for 21.2%/9.6% of 52 E. coli, 29.0%/3.2% of 31 K. pneumoniae, 53.2%/100% of 47 E. cloacae, 0%/11.1% of 99 S. marcescens, and 25.9%/55.6% of 54 P. aeruginosa isolates, respectively. Among the beta-lactamase-producers including P. aeruginosa isolates, only 2 E. coli isolates were found to be ESBL-producers. Besides, 9.6% (9/94) of H. influenzae isolates were proved to be BLNAR strains.
TI  - [Antimicrobial susceptibility and prevalence of beta-lactamase producing clinical isolates in southern Kyushu. The results of collaborative study from 1999 to 2000].
AB  - The positivity of beta-lactamase and antimicrobial susceptibility were determined in a total of 1,358 clinical isolates at 15 hospitals and clinics in four prefectures in southern Kyushu (Okinawa, Miyazaki, Kagoshima and Kumamoto) during the period from December 1999 to February 2000. The isolates collected comprised of 176 strains of S. aureus, 203 of H. influenzae, 102 of M. catarrhalis, 206 of E. coli, 153 of K. pneumoniae, 99 of E. cloacae, 95 of S. marcescens, 201 of P. aeruginosa, 79 of E. faecalis, and 44 of E. faecium. The frequency of CPDX resistance among E. coli in particular varied geographically, and was found to be higher in Kumamoto and Kagoshima. The strains of K. pneumoniae and E. cloacae resistant to common antimicrobial agents were particularly found in Kagoshima, and one strain of IPM-resistant E. cloacae was isolated in Miyazaki. Also, the geographical difference in the frequency of LVFX resistance among the isolates of E. cloacae was noted, the results indicating the higher prevalence in Okinawa and Kagoshima. Resistant isolates of P. aeruginosa were less common in Kagoshima, and four isolates of P. aeruginosa from Miyazaki were found to be resistant to CAZ and IPM. None of the isolates of S. aureus and Enterococcus spp. was resistant to VCM or TEIC at all. The isolates of E. faecalis resistant at high-level GM (500 micrograms/ml) and SM (1,000 micrograms/ml) were found in 27.8% and 22.8%, and those of E. faecium were 6.8% and 38.6%, respectively. Overall, the ratio of MRSA among S. aureus was 67.6%, and three isolates were resistant to ABK with no less than 8 micrograms/ml of MIC. The frequency of BLNAR (beta-lactamase-negative, ampicillin resistant) among H. influenzae isolated in Okinawa was markedly higher (isolation ratio, 37.9%) when compared with other prefectures, and the isolates of BLPACR (beta-lactamase-positive, AMPC/CVA resistant) were found only in Okinawa with a ratio of 41.6%. A total of 18 strains of ESBL defined by the NCCLS criteria (M100-S11) were isolated, eight strains of K. pneumoniae and 10 strains of E. coli. Of 18 isolates of ESBL, 13 were from Kagoshima and the remaining five were from Kumamoto.
TI  - [Beta-lactamase activity and susceptibilities to antibiotics among some species of bacteria isolated from medical institution between December 1999 and February 2000].
AB  - We studied the beta-lactamase activity and susceptibilities to antibiotics in 604 strains among 10 species of bacteria isolated from 10 medical institutions in Tottori and Shimane Prefectures between December 1999 and February 2000. beta-Lactamase activity was measured by the nitrocefin test and penicillinase/cephalosporinase activities were measured by acidometry. beta-Lactamase activity was detected in 72.1% of S. aureus, 18.8% of H. influenzae, and 96.3% of M. catarrhalis. Penicillinase/cephalosporinase activities were detected in 17.8%/22.2% of E. coli, 9.7%/0.0% of K. pneumoniae, 18.6%/95.3% of E. cloacae, 12.7%/79.4% of S. marcescens, and 7.1%/31.8% of P. aeruginosa. Three of 72 strains (4.2%) of K. pneumoniae and 5 of 90 strains (5.6%) of E. coli were assessed as ESBL-producing bacteria using the NCCLS proposed screening method based on routine susceptibility testing results. BLNAR were detected in 13 of 69 strains (18.8%) of H. influenzae.
TI  - [beta-lactamase-producing activity and antimicrobial susceptibility of major pathogenic bacteria isolated from clinical samples. Japan beta-lactamase Research Group].
AB  - beta-Lactamase production and susceptibility to an assortment of antimicrobial agents were examined in 9,483 strains of organisms isolated from clinical materials obtained from inpatients and outpatients at 104 institutions throughout Japan from December 1999 to February 2000. The organisms were Staphylococcus aureus, 1,369 strains, including 847 methicillin-resistant (MRSA) strains; Enterococcus faecalis, 735 strains; Enterococcus faecium, 302 strains; Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, 730 strains; Haemophilus influenzae, 1,142 strains; Escherichia coli, 1,276 strains; Klebsiella pneumoniae, 1,058 strains; Enterobacter cloacae, 772 strains; Serratia marcescens, 847 strains; and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 1,252 strains. The 23 antimicrobial agents used were ampicillin, sulbactam/ampicillin, clavulanic acid/amoxicillin, oxacillin, piperacillin, cefazolin, cefotiam, cefmetazole, cefoperazone, sulbactam/cefoperazone, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefepime, cefpodoxime, imipenem, gentamicin, arbekacin, clarithromycin, minocycline, chloramphenicol, vancomycin, teicoplanin, and levofloxacin. Antimicrobial agents appropriate for each organism were used. Among S. aureus strains, 61.9% were MRSA, and 62.3% were positive for beta-lactamase. Among the MRSA strains, none was resistant to vancomycin or teicoplanin, and only 3% were resistant to arbekacin. There was no vancomycin resistance in the Enterococcus strains. Only 0.1% of E. faecalis strains were ampicillin-resistant. Among the M. catarrhalis strains, 97.5% produced beta-lactamase, while among the H. influenzae strains, 8.5% produced beta-lactamase and 14.5% were beta-lactamase-negative and ampicillin-resistant (BLNAR). Among the Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa strains, there were 20 (E. coli; 7/1,276, K. pneumoniae; 13/1,058) that produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs), and 11 that produced class B beta-lactamases. Multiple drug resistance was advanced in every species, and organisms resistant to 7 or more common antimicrobial agents were isolated. The best combination of antimicrobial agent and beta-lactamase inhibitor was sulbactam/cefoperazone. Sulbactam/cefoperazone, cefepime, and imipenem still have excellent antimicrobial activity. Rates of resistance to each antimicrobial agent differed more among institutions than among geographical regions.
TI  - Functional cloning and expression of emeA, and characterization of EmeA, a multidrug efflux pump from Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - A fragment of chromosomal DNA from Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212 was cloned using Escherichia coli KAM32 host cells lacking major multidrug efflux pumps. E. coli KAM32 cells were sensitive to many antimicrobial agents, and the transformed cells harboring a recombinant plasmid became resistant to several structurally unrelated antimicrobial agents such as tetraphenylphosphonium chloride, 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), Hoechst 33342, acriflavine, benzalkonium chloride, norfloxacin and ethidium bromide. This suggests that the cloned DNA fragment carries a gene(s) encoding a multidrug efflux pump. Determination of the nucleotide sequence of the cloned DNA revealed a gene designated as emeA. The transformed E. coli cells showed efflux activity of several antimicrobial agents such as DAPI, Hoechst 33342 and acriflavine. Efflux of DAPI via EmeA was strongly inhibited by reserpine.
TI  - Vaginal bacterial flora activates rat peritoneal mast cells.
AB  - Sixteen strains of physiological and pathological vaginal bacteria were tested for their ability to secrete histamine from rat peritoneal mast cells in vitro. We noticed that Mycoplasma hominis-induced histamine release was very high (up to 53.6%). The stimulation of rat mast cells with Staphylococccus cohnii, Staphylococcus coagulase(-) (two strains), Ureaplasma urealyticum, Peptostreptococcus spp., Bacteroides capillosus, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae resulted in lower but significant histamine secretion (11.2%-17.5%). Other bacteria strains (Staphylococcus epidermidids, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Actinomyces naeslundii (two strains) and Lactobacillus fermentum (two strains) caused very low (4.2% - 8.8%) histamine release.
TI  - [The disturbing development of resistance in urinary tract infections].
AB  - Despite recent caveats about the rapid development of resistance to fluoroquinolones in the treatment of urinary tract infections (UTI), the good tolerability, bioavailability and the broad antibiotic spectrum of fluoroquinolons explain their increased use. We investigated the changes of bacterial spectra and cross resistance profiles in ambulatory and hospitalized UTI patients. A total of 430 positive urine cultures and resistograms were classified according to patient status as either ambulatory or hospitalized and retrospectively analyzed. Cross-resistance profiles of the most effective antibiotics (cotrimoxazol, levofloxacin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid) were made before an analysis of cost-effectiveness was performed. Whereas Escherichia coli remains the predominant cause of UTI in ambulatory patients, Enterococcus faecalis is the most frequently detected bacterium in the urine cultures of hospitalized patients. This is one reason for the unacceptably high rate of primary resistance of UTI bacteria against cephalosporins. Primary resistance to cotrimoxazol, amoxicillin/cavulanic acid and levofloxacin are impressive and tend to favor the use of levofloxacin. However, high cross-resistance rates reduce the usability of one antibiotic in case of the lack of effectiveness of the other. The broad use of potent antibiotics in hospitals has led to a higher primary resistance and cross-resistance of UTI bacteria in hospitalized patients than in ambulatory patients. The primary resistance of UTI causing bacteria is generally high and worrying. The new fluoroquinolone levofloxacin exhibits surprisingly high primary resistance rates and shares high cross-resistance with other antibiotics that are as effective but much cheaper. Thus, we consider that it should not be a first line treatment option for ambulatory UTI patients in the absence of any resistogram, in order to ensure cost-effectiveness and a slow down in the rapid development of resistance.
TI  - Intestinal mucosal oxidative damage and bacterial translocation in cirrhotic rats.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial translocation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis mainly due to intestinal bacterial overgrowth. Alterations in the functional integrity of the intestinal barrier caused by an increased production of free radical metabolites as a consequence of portal hypertension could also facilitate bacterial translocation in cirrhotic rats. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to determine intestinal mucosal lipid peroxidation and neutrophil infiltration and their relationship with portal hypertension and bacterial translocation in cirrhotic rats. DESIGN: Eighteen male Sprague-Dawley rats with cirrhosis induced by carbon tetrachloride, administered by gavage, and eight control rats were included in the study. METHODS: Samples of jejunum, ileum and caecum were obtained by laparotomy for the determination of malondialdehyde and myeloperoxidase as indexes of lipid peroxidation and neutrophil infiltration, respectively. Samples of ascitic and pleural fluids, mesenteric lymph nodes and ileal stools were obtained for the culture of microoganisms. RESULTS: The concentration of malondialdehyde was significantly higher in ileal and caecal, but not in jejunal mucosa, in cirrhotic rats, mainly in those with ascites (P< 0.01), as compared to control rats (P< 0.01), and in cirrhotic rats with bacterial translocation compared to those without bacterial translocation (P< 0.01). No differences between groups were observed in the concentrations of myeloperoxidase in jejunum, ileum or caecum. A direct correlation between ileal malondialdehyde and portal pressure was observed (P< 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Cirrhotic rats, particularly those with ascites and bacterial translocation, show increased malondialdehyde levels in ileal and caecal mucosa. These results suggest that mucosal oxidative damage in ileum and caecum could favour bacterial translocation in cirrhotic rats.
TI  - Effects of burn wound excision on bacterial colonization and invasion.
AB  - Rates of survival after thermal injury have improved in the past two decades, and rates of wound infections and sepsis have decreased during the same period. Early excision has been advocated as one of the major factors, but its safety and efficacy and the exact timing of burn excision are still under debate. It was hypothesized that acute burn wound excision (in the first 24 hours after burning) would be superior to conservative treatment and delayed excision in preventing bacterial colonization and invasion. Twenty consecutive patients with thermal injuries were studied. Twelve patients underwent acute burn wound excision, and eight patients underwent conservative treatment and delayed excision. The second group of patients received topical treatments in another facility and underwent delayed excision after transfer to our service, on postburn day 6. Quantitative bacteriological assessments of the excised wound and biopsy samples of the wound bed, obtained before autografting and/or homografting, were performed. The effects of time on bacterial counts, differences between superficial and deep biopsy samples, and the effects of early versus late debridement were studied. Patients admitted early exhibited bacterial counts of less than 10 bacteria per gram of tissue. Patients in this group did not experience infection or graft loss. Patients admitted late exhibited counts of more than 10 bacteria (p = 0.001, compared with early admission). Three patients in the late excision group experienced infection and graft loss (p < 0.05, compared with the early excision group). Burn wound excision significantly decreased bacterial colonization for all patients (p < 0.001). Greater bacterial colonization and higher rates of infection were correlated with topical treatment and late excision (p < 0.001). It is concluded that burn wound excision significantly reduces bacterial colonization. Patients who undergo topical treatment and delayed burn wound excision exhibit greater bacterial colonization and increased rates of infection. Acute burn wound excision should be considered for all full-thickness burns.
TI  - MC21-A, a bactericidal antibiotic produced by a new marine bacterium, Pseudoalteromonas phenolica sp. nov. O-BC30(T), against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - We previously reported a new marine bacterium, Pseudoalteromonas phenolica sp. nov. O-BC30(T), which produced a bactericidal antibiotic against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). In the present study, we purified an anti-MRSA substance (MC21-A) from the methanol extract of the cells of P. phenolica O-BC30(T) and analyzed its chemical structure. MC21-A was determined to be 3,3',5,5'-tetrabromo-2,2'-biphenyldiol by spectrometric analyses. Its anti-MRSA activity against 10 clinical isolates of MRSA was comparable to that of vancomycin (MC21-A MICs, 1 to 2 micro g/ml; vancomycin MICs, <0.25 to 2 micro g/ml). This substance was also high active against Enterococcus serolicida, Enterococcus faecium, and Enterococcus faecalis but was less active against Streptococcus spp. A time-kill study also demonstrated that MC21-A was bactericidal and that its killing rate was much higher than that of vancomycin. The postantibiotic effect (PAE) of MC21-A against a clinical MRSA isolate, strain E 31243, was also comparable to that of vancomycin (MC21-A PAEs, 1.46 to 1.65 h; vancomycin PAEs, 0.84 to 1.43 h). However, a lysis experiment demonstrated that this substance failed to lyse MRSA cells. This substance also did not lyse human erythrocytes. A SYTOX Green staining experiment implied that this substance permeabilized the cell membrane of MRSA as its mode of action. When its activities against a hypersensitive Escherichia coli mutant (KO 1489) and wild-type strains were tested, MC21-A exhibited higher levels of activity against the former. Furthermore, MC21-A was not cytotoxic to human normal fibroblast, rat pheochromocytoma, and Vero cells at concentrations up to 50 micro g/ml. These results suggest that MC21-A might be useful as a lead compound in the development of new types of anti-MRSA substances with modes of action different from those of vancomycin and teicoplanin.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities on antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (2000). III. Secular changes in susceptibility].
AB  - The bacteria (Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) isolated from patients diagnosed as having urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 10 institutions in Japan were supplied between August 2000 and July 2001. Then, the susceptibilities of these bacteria to various antimicrobial agents were examined, and the results were compared with those obtained between 1992 and 1999. Comparison was made by classifying strains isolated from patients into those in uncomplicated UTIs and those in complicated UTIs (including with or without indwelling catheter). E. faecalis showed good susceptibility to ampicillin (ABPC) and imipenem (IPM), and the MIC90s were 2 micrograms/ml. Also, E. faecalis showed good susceptibility to vancomycin (VCM). However, the MIC90, which was 2 micrograms/ml between 1992 and 1999, rose to 4 micrograms/ml in patients with complicated UTIs because the strains inhibited at 4 micrograms/ml increased more than before. The low susceptibility of S. aureus to arbekacin (ABK) in complicated UTIs, as shown in 1998 and 1999, recovered in 2000, and no strains inhibited at > or = 4 micrograms/ml were detected. E. coli showed good susceptibility to CTM (MIC90: 0.25-0.5 microgram/ml) and CZOP (MIC90: < or = 0.125 microgram/ml) and was not resistant to those. E. coli also showed good susceptibility to the other drugs except to penicillins. Decreases in susceptibility of E. coli to quinolones, ciprofloxacin (CPFX), and sparfloxacin (SPFX) were observed in the patients with complicated UTIs. The susceptibility of Klebsiella spp. to all drugs did not significantly change in 2000 and was generally good except to penicillins. Although the susceptibility of P. aeruginosa to carbapenems was notable, the MIC90 went up from 4 micrograms/ml to 16 micrograms/ml in complicated UTIs compared with those observed in the previous year.
TI  - Normal conjunctival flora in the North American opossum (Didelphis virginiana) and raccoon (Procyon lotor).
AB  - We documented the normal conjunctival bacterial flora from 17 opossums (Didelphis virginiana) and 10 raccoons (Procyon lotor) trapped in Manhattan, Kansas (USA) from November 1999 to January 2000. Both raccoons and opossums were free of apparent ocular disease. The inferior conjunctival sacs of each animal were swabbed for aerobic bacterial and Mycoplasma culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for Mycoplasma and Chlamydia detection. All conjunctival samples were positive for one or more species of aerobic bacteria. The most common isolate from opossums was Staphylococcus spp. Other isolates included Streptococcus spp., Bacillus spp., Corynebacterium spp., and Enterococcus faecalis. The most common isolates in raccoons was Bacillus spp. Other isolates included Streptococcus spp., Staphylococcus spp., non-hemolytic Escherichia coli, and Enterococcus faecalis. Mycoplasma culture was negative in samples from opossums and raccoons. Evidence of Mycoplasma and Chlamydia presence was detected by PCR.
TI  - Evaluation of a novel automated chemiluminescent assay system for antimicrobial susceptibility testing.
AB  - The newly developed Rapid Lumi Eiken/IS60 (RL/IS60) system automatically determines MICs by detecting chemiluminescence produced in the reaction of a chemiluminescent probe and oxygen metabolites from living microorganisms. The present study evaluated this system for accuracy in antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Chemiluminescence intensities after 4 h of cultivation of clinically important strains were plotted against various concentrations of antimicrobial agents, which resulted in curves reflecting the levels of susceptibility. Sixty-percent inhibitory concentrations based on the susceptibility curves agreed with MICs determined by the reference microdilution method. When the MICs of antimicrobial agents for four quality control (QC) strains (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) were determined by the RL/IS60 system, most (91.1%) of them were within the QC limits proposed by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards. The system was further assessed for a total of 162 clinical isolates, including E. coli, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, P. aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, S. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Overall, there was 90.6% agreement between the RL/IS60 system and the reference microdilution method. Our results suggest that the RL/IS60 system provides rapid and reliable MICs of a variety of antimicrobial agents for clinical isolates as well as QC strains.
TI  - Role of internalization in the pathogenicity of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli infection in a gnotobiotic murine model.
AB  - We investigated the role of bacterial internalization in the killing caused by Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) infection using a gnotobiotic murine model. A high number of internalized STEC was found in the colonic epithelial cells of STEC-infected mice by both an ex vivo assay and transmission electron microscopy. Most of these mice were killed within 10 days after infection. However, the implantation of lactic acid bacteria in such mice before infection markedly decreased the number of internalized STECs and also completely protected these hosts from killing by a STEC infection. The inhibition of such internalization by immunoglobulin also prevented the hosts from being killed. The Shiga toxin levels in these hosts indicated an inhibition of the penetration of Shiga toxins produced in the colon to the underlying tissue. These results suggested that the internalization plays an important role in the pathogenicity caused by STEC infection in a gnotobiotic murine model.
TI  - [Dynamics of antibiotic resistance of purulent septic pathogens at an emergency facility].
AB  - The predominant pathogens at the emergency medicine hospital were analysed and its resistance to antibiotics was investigated in dynamics. The susceptibility of the pathogens was analysed by the method of dynamic equalibration. Statistically significant reduction of resistant bacteria isolation was demonstrated for 2 species of 7--that is S. aureus and E. faecalis regarding 4 antibiotics. The ratio of staphylococci resistant to cefazolin, ceftazidime, doxycyclin reduced, the ratio of enterococci resistant to chloramphenicol and doxycyclin also diminished. No correlation was demonstrated between the pathogen isolation frequency and ratio of resistant strains.
TI  - DNA polymerase III of Enterococcus faecalis: expression and characterization of recombinant enzymes encoded by the polC and dnaE genes.
AB  - Enterococcus faecalis (Ef) dnaE and polC, the respective genes encoding the DNA replication-specific DNA polymerase III E and DNA polymerase III C, were cloned and engineered for expression in Escherichia coli as hexahistidine (his6)-tagged recombinant proteins. Each gene expressed a catalytically active DNA polymerase of the expected molecular weight. The recombinant polymerases were purified and each was characterized with respect to catalytic properties, inhibitor sensitivity, and recognition by specific antibody raised against the corresponding DNA polymerase III of the model Gram-positive (Gr(+)) organism, Bacillus subtilis (Bs). In conclusion, the properties of each Enterococcus polymerase enzymes were similar to those of the respective B. subtilis enzymes.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Pseudognaphalium moritzianum.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of ethanol, acetone and aqueous extracts of the aerial parts of Pseudognaphalium moritzianum was evaluated. Ethanol and acetone extracts showed activity against Staphlococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The aqueous extract was active against S. aureus and P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Human beta-defensin-2 induction in Helicobacter pylori-infected gastric mucosal tissues: antimicrobial effect of overexpression.
AB  - The objective of this study was to understand more of the innate immune response  to Helicobacter pylori by determining the expression of human beta-defensin-2 (hBD-2) in various gastric mucosal tissues and MKN45 gastric cancer cells with or without H. pylori. Semi-quantitative TaqMan RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry were carried out. The antimicrobial effects of a transfected hBD-2 gene against H. pylori were also evaluated. The results showed that hBD-2 was expressed in inflamed gastric mucosal tissues with H. pylori infection, but not in the absence of H. pylori infection. Expression was also detected in gastric cancers in patients with H. pylori infection. Expression was induced in the MKN45 gastric cancer cell line by H. pylori in a manner dependent on the abundance of bacteria. hBD-2-transfected 3T3J2-1 cells secreted hBD-2 protein into the culture medium and this protein inhibited growth of H. pylori completely. The results suggest that hBD-2 may be involved in the pathophysiology of H. pylori-induced gastritis.
TI  - The lactoperoxidase system increases efficacy of high-pressure inactivation of foodborne bacteria.
AB  - The inactivation of eight different bacteria comprising Escherichia coli LMM1010  and MG1655, respectively a pressure-resistant strain and the corresponding wild-type, Salmonella Typhimurium, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Listeria innocua and Lactobacillus plantarum, by high hydrostatic pressure in skim milk supplemented with the lactoperoxidase-hydrogen peroxide-thiocyanate (LP) system at naturally occurring concentration was studied. In the absence of pressure treatment, the LP system had either no effect, i.e. on S. Typhimurium and E. coli LMM1010, a growth inhibiting effect, i.e. on E. coli MG1655, L. innocua, S. aureus, L. plantarum and E. faecalis, or a bactericidal effect, i.e. on P. fluorescens. The presence of the LP system affected inactivation by high pressure in a cell density-dependent manner. At low cell concentration (10(6) cfu/ml), the LP system strongly increased high-pressure inactivation as measured immediately after pressure treatment of all bacteria except the pressure-resistant E. coli. At high cell density (10(9) cfu/ml), only inactivation of L. innocua, E. faecalis and L. plantarum were enhanced. For both E. coli strains, the fate of the bacteria during 24 h following pressure treatment was also studied. It was found that in the presence of the LP system, considerable further inactivation occurred in the first hours after pressure treatment. The potential of the LP system to improve the bactericidal efficiency of high-pressure treatment for food preservation is discussed.
TI  - Release of antibiotics from polymethylmethacrylate cement.
AB  - The increase in resistance rates to antibiotics of bacteria isolated from infected hip joints, particularly staphylococci, prompted us to investigate the usefulness of antibiotic combinations such as gentamicin plus vancomycin. Cylinder test specimens of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) cement (Cemex, Tecres) containing gentamicin alone, vancomycin alone and both drugs in combination, were studied. The antibiotic concentrations were determined using a microbiological method and fluorescence polarization immunoassay (FPIA). The release of gentamicin alone, vancomycin alone and in combination from PMMA cement was prompt. The combination revealed synergistic antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis. FPIA showed that gentamicin and vancomycin delivery rates from PMMA cement were different. Gentamicin alone and in combination with vancomycin presented similar release rates from PMMA cement (1.50%). Vancomycin release from PMMA cylinders impregnated with the combination was lower (0.51%) than that from cylinders with vancomycin alone (1.16%). Vancomycin showed a 34.1% loss of microbiological activity at 37 degrees C after 10 days of incubation; the reduction corresponded to 15.0% when measured by FPIA. Results obtained with test specimens are indicative for the preparation of antibiotic-impregnated cements for different human prostheses.
TI  - Evaluation of dedicated stethoscopes as a potential source of nosocomial pathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the ear tips of dedicated stethoscopes (DS) that  are used on patients prescribed contact precautions for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, or multiple antibiotic-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii become contaminated with these micro-organisms. DESIGN: Culture of DS ear tips. SETTING: A 524-bed tertiary care university hospital. METHODS: DS ear tips were inoculated directly onto bacteriologic media and incubated for 48 to 72 hours. Growth of more than 10 colonies from the 2 ear tips collectively was indicative of contamination. RESULTS: Ear tips of 78 DS from 69 patients were cultured. Ear tips from 17% (13/78) of the DS were contaminated with potentially pathogenic bacteria: 2 with S aureus (1 MRSA), 1 with E faecalis, 7 with Acinetobacter species, 2 with Pseudomonas species, 1 with Escherichia coli, and 1 with Moraxella. None of the stethoscope ear tips was contaminated with the same pathogen for which the patient was prescribed contact precautions (95% CI, 0-3.8%). CONCLUSION: Although the ear tips of DS from patients who were prescribed contact precautions for MRSA, vancomycin-resistant E faecium, or multiple antibiotic-resistant A baumannii were not contaminated with the indicated nosocomial pathogen, 94% of the evaluable ear tips were contaminated, including with MRSA (1.3%) and Acinetobacter (11%). Regular disinfection of ear tips of DS between users should be considered.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of BAL9141, a novel parenteral cephalosporin active against oxacillin-resistant staphylococci.
AB  - Community-acquired and nosocomial infections caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-positive pathogens continue to increase in prevalence and have become a serious problem in many parts of the world. BAL9141 is a member of the class of parenteral pyrrolidinone-3-ylidenemethyl cephalosporins, and has a broad spectrum of activity. In the current study, BAL9141 was tested against a large number (n = 2263) of recent isolates from various international surveillance programmes including 1097 Gram-positive strains. Susceptibility to (S) and activity of (mg/L) to BAL9141, based on proposed breakpoints (MIC50/MIC90/% S) were as follows: methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (0.5/0.5/100%), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) (1/2/100%), methicillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) (0.12/0.25/100%), methicillin-resistant CoNS (MR-CoNS) (1/2/100%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (< or = 0.015/0.25/100%), viridans group streptococci (0.03/0.5/99%), beta-haemolytic streptococci (< or = 0.015/< or = 0.015/100%), Enterococcus faecalis (0.5/16/90%), Enterococcus faecium (>32/>32/22%), Haemophilus influenzae (0.06/0.06/100%), Moraxella catarrhalis (0.06/0.5/100%), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (0.03/0.06/100%) and Neisseria meningitidis (< or = 0.002/0.004/100%). BAL9141 susceptibility at < pr = 4 mg/L (100% S) surpassed that of ceftriaxone (CRO; 1% S) and quinupristin/dalfopristin (Q-D; 92% S) against MRSA and MR-CoNS (CRO 0.9% S; Q-D 94% S). All S. pneumoniae were inhibited by BAL9141 at < or = 1 mg/L compared with CRO (90% S) and levofloxacin (LVX; 98% S). Susceptibility rates for viridans group streptococci to BAL9141 (>98%) were also higher than to CRO (86%) and LVX (96%). BAL9141 demonstrated excellent activity against most species of wild-type enteric bacilli, with > or = 95% of isolates being susceptible; however, only modest activity was observed for BAL9141 against non-fermentative Gram-negative species and ESBL-producing Escherichia coli or Klebsiella pneumoniae. BAL9141 demonstrated excellent activity against many tested pathogens displaying various resistance phenotypes, and should be particularly valuable in the treatment of MRSA as well as for drug-resistant streptococci, while maintaining a spectrum resembling a 'third-generation' cephalosporin against other clinically important species.
TI  - Sensitivity and rapidity of blood culture bottles in the detection of cornea organ culture media contamination by bacteria and fungi.
AB  - AIMS: To test the bactericidal activity of standard organ culture medium, and to  compare the sensitivity and rapidity of blood culture bottles with conventional microbiological methods for detection of bacteria and fungi inoculated in a standard cornea organ culture medium. METHODS: The bactericidal activity of contaminated standard organ culture medium containing 100 IU/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 micro g/ml amphotericin B was evaluated after 48 hours of incubation at 31 degrees C with five inocula of 14 bacteria. Two yeasts (Candida spp) and one Aspergillus were also tested. Contaminated media were then inoculated in three blood bottles (aerobic, anaerobic, fungal) placed in a Bactec 9240 automat; three conventional microbiological broths were the control. Changes in colour of organ culture medium and growth on conventional broth were screened daily by visual inspection. The sensitivity and rapidity of detection of contamination were compared between the three methods: blood bottle, conventional, and visual. RESULTS: Organ culture medium eradicated five bacteria irrespective of the starting inoculums: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Propionibacterium acnes, and Haemophilus influenzae. For micro-organisms where the medium was ineffective or bactericidal only (methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Bacillus subtilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Candida albicans, Candida kruzei, Aspergillus fumigatus), the blood bottle, conventional, and visual methods detected microbial growth in 100%, 76.5%, and 70% of cases respectively. Mean detection time using blood bottles was 15.1 hours (SD 13.8, range 2-52). In cases of detection by the blood bottle method and the conventional method, the former was always faster: 95.5% against 65.2% detection within 24 hours (p=0.022) respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Blood bottles detect more efficiently and more rapidly a wider range of bacteria and fungi than the conventional microbiological method and the visual inspection of organ culture media.
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial activity evaluation of some new adamantane derivatives.
AB  - In this study, some new Schiff bases were synthesized as antimicrobial agents using benzaldehyde derivatives and 1- or 2-aminoadamantane. The structures of the synthesized compounds were confirmed by IR, 1H-NMR and elementary analysis. Antimicrobial activities of the synthesized compounds were tested against some bacteria and yeast-like fungi. The antimicrobial activity of the compounds was investigated by broth microdilution method using two Gram positive (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212) and two Gram negative (Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853) bacteria and yeast-like fungi (Candida albicans ATCC 90028, Candida krusei ATCC 6258, Candida parapsilosis ATCC 22019). The antifungal activity of 1-((2-chloro-3,4-dimethoxybenzylidene) amino(adamantane (compound 3) against C. krusei and C. parapsilosis (minimal inhibitory concentration 32 micrograms/ml) was higher than that of the other tested compounds.
TI  - Innate immune responses of human neonatal cells to bacteria from the normal gastrointestinal flora.
AB  - The hygiene hypothesis postulates that the prevalence of allergy has increased due to decreased microbial stimulation early in life, leading to delayed maturation of the immune system. The aim of this study was to examine the cytokine pattern produced from cord blood mononuclear cells relative to adult cells after stimulation with bacterial strains from the normal flora. Mononuclear cells from cord and adult blood samples were stimulated with the following bacteria: Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Enterococcus faecalis, Lactobacillus plantarum, Streptococcus mitis, Corynebacterium minutissimum, Clostridium perfringens, Bacteroides vulgatus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Veillonella parvula, and Neisseria sicca. The levels of interleukin 12 (IL-12), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-10, and IL-6 were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The TNF-alpha production was also analyzed after blocking CD14, Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR-2), and TLR-4 prior to stimulation with bacteria. The levels of IL-12 and TNF-alpha were similar in cord and adult cells. Gram-positive bacteria induced considerably higher levels of IL-12 and TNF-alpha than gram-negative bacteria in both cord and adult cells. The levels of IL-6 were significantly higher in newborns than in adults, whereas the levels of IL-10 were similar in newborns and adults. Gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria induced similar levels of IL-6 and IL-10 in cord cells. L. plantarum bound or signaled through CD14, TLR-2, and TLR-4, whereas E. coli acted mainly through CD14 and TLR-4. These results indicate that the innate immune response in newborns to commensal bacteria is strong and also suggest that different bacterial strains may have differential effects on the maturation of the immune system of infants.

TI  - [Surveillance for antimicrobial resistance: VIRA Study].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Resistance to antimicrobial drugs has increased in recent years. The aim of this multicenter study was to determine the current situation in Spain regarding the resistance patterns of the most common infectious agents to antimicrobial drugs. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total 1,475 strains isolated in 38 hospitals in October 2001 were studied. These included 294 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), 149 clinically significant coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), 96 Enterococcus faecium, 1 ampicillin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, 204 penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, 100 ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae, 361 ciprofloxacin-resistant Escherichia coli, 160 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 110 Acinetobacter baumannii. Sensitivity to various antibiotics was studied by a broth microdilution method. Additionally, an epidemiologic survey was conducted in the participating hospitals to determine the incidence of these multi-drug resistant microorganisms. RESULTS: Overall incidence of ciprofloxacin-resistant E. coli and MRSA strains was 24% in both cases. The pneumococci were resistant to several antibiotics. Telithromycin showed excellent activity against all the pneumococci, including those resistant to macrolides. Most MRSA isolates were resistant to quinolones and macrolides. All the staphylococci were susceptible to linezolid and quinupristin-dalfopristin. Only 50% of A. baumannii strains were susceptible to imipenem. CONCLUSION: The results of this study evidence increasing multi-drug resistance among various microorganisms, such as MRSA, CNS, ampicillin-resistant enterococci, and penicillin-resistant pneumococci, and underline the need for surveillance programs to gain information on this significant therapeutic problem.
TI  - A retrospective investigation of advanced periodontal disease as a risk factor for septicemia in hematopoietic stem cell and bone marrow transplant recipients.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Septicemia is a cause of death in hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients. Extraction of teeth with advanced periodontitis has been advocated before HSCT to prevent septicemia in myeloablated hosts. The primary aim of the present study was to determine impact of chronic periodontitis, as measured by radiographic alveolar bone loss, on septicemia and transplant mortality. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective design was used to study 77 subjects who received pretransplant dental evaluation, panoramic radiography, and full myeloablative allogeneic HSCT to treat hematologic malignancies. Radiographic crestal alveolar bone loss was measured with a Schei ruler on all teeth. Microorganisms isolated from positive blood cultures within the first 100 days after transplant were categorized as of likely origin from periodontal, oral, or any body sites. Spearman correlation and logistic regression analysis assessed associations between positive blood cultures, mean subject whole-mouth percent radiographic crestal alveolar bone loss, and 100-day survival. RESULTS: Radiographic crestal alveolar bone loss per study subject averaged 13% +/- 7%, with 18.2% exhibiting bone loss of 20% or greater. During the initial 100 days after transplant, 63.6% subjects yielded septicemia-associated positive blood cultures, with Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus mitis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus sanguis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli as the most common isolates recovered. No statistically significant associations were found between mean subject radiographic alveolar bone loss and septicemia of likely periodontal or oral origin. CONCLUSION: In this preliminary study, no relationship was found between radiographic periodontal status and septicemia or mortality within the initial 100 days after transplant. A larger-sized, prospective study is warranted to further delineate the risk of septicemia from periodontal and other oral diseases in immunocompromised patients.
TI  - Interactive inhibition of meat spoilage and pathogenic bacteria by lysozyme, nisin and EDTA in the presence of nitrite and sodium chloride at 24 degrees C.
AB  - To develop a nisin- and lysozyme-based antimicrobial treatment for use with processed ham and bologna, in vitro experiments were conducted to determine whether inhibition enhancing interactions occur between the antimicrobials lysozyme, chrisin (a commercial nisin preparation), EDTA, NaCl and NaNO(2). Inhibitory interactions were observed between a number of agents when used against specific pathogenic and spoilage bacteria. The observed interactions included lysozyme with EDTA (Enterococcus faecalis and Weissella viridescens), chrisin with EDTA (all Gram-positive organisms), EDTA with NaCl (Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Serratia grimesii), EDTA with nitrite (E. coli, Lactobacillus curvatus, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Listeria monocytogenes, S. Typhimurium), chrisin with nitrite (Lc. mesenteroides, L. monocytogenes), and NaCl with nitrite (S. Typhimurium, Shewanella putrefaciens). Previous reports have described interactions between nisin with EDTA that resulted in enhanced antimicrobial effect against Gram-negative bacteria, or lysozyme with nisin against Gram-positive bacteria. These interactions were not observed in these experiments. We observed that unlike previous studies, these experiments were conducted on growing cells in nutrient broth, rather than under conditions of nutrient limitation. We propose that screening of antimicrobials for use in food systems in nutrient-deficient systems is inappropriate and that new protocols should be developed.
TI  - Influence of dry period bacterial intramammary infection on clinical mastitis in  dairy cows.
AB  - Milk samples were taken from 1920 quarters (480 cows, six herds) on four occasions to examine the relationship between quarter level intramammary infection (IMI) during the dry period and clinical mastitis in the next lactation. All quarters were sampled at drying off and within 1 wk of calving, and two quarters from each cow were sampled both 0 to 7 and 8 to 14 d before calving. Milk samples were collected from all cases of clinical mastitis during the following lactation. Logistic regression models were developed to investigate the associations between IMI present during the sampling period and clinical mastitis. The probability of a quarter succumbing to clinical mastitis increased when Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, or Enterobacter spp. were cultured at drying off and when Escherichia coli, coagulase-positive staphylococcus, Serratia spp., or Streptococcus faecalis were cultured in two out of three late dry and post-calving samples. Quarters from which Corynebacterium spp. were isolated at drying off were at an increased risk of clinical mastitis, whereas the presence of Corynebacterium spp. in the late dry and post-calving samples was associated with a reduction in the risk of clinical mastitis. The risk of mastitis for specific pathogens increased if the same species of bacteria that had caused mastitis was isolated at least twice in the late dry and post-calving samples. Kaplan-Meier survival plots indicated that clinical mastitis associated with dry period infections was more likely to occur earlier in lactation than clinical mastitis not associated with dry period infections. There was evidence of quarter susceptibility to IMI or the possibility that infection with one organism led to clinical mastitis with another.
TI  - Structure-activity studies of 14-helical antimicrobial beta-peptides: probing the relationship between conformational stability and antimicrobial potency.
AB  - Antimicrobial alpha-helical alpha-peptides are part of the host-defense mechanism of multicellular organisms and could find therapeutic use against bacteria that are resistant to conventional antibiotics. Recent work from Hamuro et al. has shown that oligomers of beta-amino acids ("beta-peptides") that can adopt an amphiphilic helix defined by 14-membered ring hydrogen bonds ("14-helix") are active against Escherichia coli [Hamuro, Y.; Schneider, J. P.; DeGrado, W. F. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999, 121, 12200-12201]. We have created two series of cationic 9- and 10-residue amphiphilic beta-peptides to probe the effect of 14-helix stability on antimicrobial and hemolytic activity. 14-Helix stability within these series is modulated by varying the proportions of rigid trans-2-aminocyclohexanecarboxylic acid (ACHC) residues and flexible acyclic residues. We have previously shown that a high proportion of ACHC residues in short beta-peptides encourages 14-helical structure in aqueous solution [Appella, D. H.; Barchi, J. J.; Durell, S. R.; Gellman, S. H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999, 121, 2309-2310]. Circular dichroism of the beta-peptides described here reveals a broad range of 14-helix population in aqueous buffer, but this variation in helical propensity does not lead to significant changes in antibiotic activity against a set of four bacteria. Several of the 9-mers display antibiotic activity comparable to that of a synthetic magainin derivative. Among these 9-mers, hemolytic activity increases slightly with increasing 14-helical propensity, but all of the 9-mers are less hemolytic than the magainin derivative. Previous studies with conventional peptides (alpha-amino acid residues) have provided conflicting evidence on the relationship between helical propensity and antimicrobial activity. This uncertainty has arisen because alpha-helix stability can be varied to only a limited extent among linear alpha-peptides without modifying parameters important for antimicrobial activity (e.g., net charge or hydrophobicity); a much greater range of helical stability is accessible with beta-peptides. For example, it is very rare for a linear alpha-peptide to display significant alpha-helix formation in aqueous solution and manifest antibacterial activity, while the linear beta-peptides described here range from fully unfolded to very highly folded in aqueous solution. This study shows that beta-peptides can be unique tools for analyzing relationships between conformational stability and biological activity.
TI  - [Survey on drug resistance to ciprofloxacin in common pathogenic bacteria].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To obtain primary knowledge of drug resistance to ciprofloxacin in the common pathogenic bacteria in this hospital thereby to bring the situation under control. METHODS: A total of 3 800 strains of pathogenic bacteria were isolated from in-patients from 1997 to 2000, and drug resistance of these strains to ciprofloxacin was examined. RESULTS: During the past 4 years, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis were found to be highly resistant to ciprofloxacin with the rates still on the rise from 50%, 25.6% and 40.3% in 1997 to 62.2%, 53.4% and 63.6% respectively in 2000. Over 40% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter were resistant to ciprofloxacin and the percentages for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter reached 31.1% to 34.0% in 2000. Among the 189 strains of the pathogenic bacteria isolated from patients with sustained infection in our hospital in 2000, over 70% of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis were identified as having resistance to ciprofloxacin. CONCLUSION: The percentages of common pathogenic bacteria that are resistant to ciprofloxacin have been considerably high and tend to increase further. Ciprofloxacin abuse needs to be given appropriate attention.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (2000). II. Background of patients].
AB  - Five-hundred eighty eight bacterial strains isolated from 435 patients diagnosed  as having urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 10 institutions in Japan were supplied between August 2000 and July 2001. Then, the clinical background of patients were investigated such as sex, age, and type of infections, infections and kind of bacteria, frequency of bacteria isolation by age and infections, bacteria and infections by timing of antibiotics administration, and bacteria and infections by surgical procedures. About the relationship between age and sex of patients and type of infections, the number of male patients aged less than 50 years was few, and complicated UTIs without indwelling catheter was the most frequent. In females, the number of patients aged less than 20 years was few. The majority of female patients aged 40 years and over had complicated UTIs while uncomplicated UTIs was most frequent in the patients being twenties. As for type of infections and kind of bacteria, Escherichia coli decreased when the infections became complicated, and pseudomonas aeruginosa increased when the infection became complicated. Enterococcus faecalis was isolated more frequently in complicated UTIs than in uncomplicated UTIs. Considering this result by age of patients, isolated frequency of E. coli was gradually decreased with aging in patients aged 20 years and over with uncomplicated UTIs or complicated UTIs without indwelling catheter. The isolated frequencies of Klebsiella spp., P. aeruginosa, and E. faecalis were high in the patients with complicated UTIs without indwelling catheter. In the patients aged 70 years and over with complicated UTIs with indwelling catheter, P. aeruginosa and E. faecalis were frequently isolated. As for type of causative organisms in UTIs before and after the administration of antibiotics, the isolation of bacteria was remarkably decreased after administration in the patients with uncomplicated UTIs and complicated UTIs without indwelling catheter. E. coli decreased after administration of antibiotics, and P. aeruginosa increased after administration in the patients with all types of infections. As for type of causative organisms in UTIs and surgical procedures, E. coli was frequently isolated in the patients without surgery in all types of infections, while P. aeruginosa was frequently isolated in the patients who underwent surgery. In uncomplicated UTIs, Proteus spp. and E. faecalis were frequently isolated in the patients with surgery. In complicated UTIs without indwelling catheter, Klebsiella spp. was frequently isolated in the patients without surgery and E. faecalis was frequently isolated in the patients with surgery. In complicated UTIs with indwelling catheter, most of organisms except P. aeruginosa and S. aureus were frequently isolated in the patients without surgery.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (2000). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The bacterial strains isolated from patients diagnosed as having urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 10 institutions in Japan were supplied between the period of August 2000 and July 2001. Then, the susceptibilities of them to many kinds of antimicrobial agents were investigated. The number of them were 511 strains. The breakdown of these strains was Gram-positive bacteria as 29.0% and Gram-negative bacteria as 71.0%. Susceptibilities of these bacteria to antimicrobial agents were as follows; vancomycin (VCM), ampicillin (ABPC) and imipenem (IPM) showed strong activities against Enterococcus faecalis. No increase in low-susceptible strains of E. faecalis observed against these antimicrobial agents. VCM showed a strong activity against MRSA preventing growth of all strains with 1 microgram/ml. In addition, the activity of arbekacin (ABK) was strong with the MIC90 of 2 micrograms/ml against MRSA and prevented growth of all strains with 4 micrograms/ml. ABK showed a strong activity against Staphylococcus epidermidis preventing growth of all strains with 0.5 microgram/ml. ABPC, cefotiam (CTM) and cefozopran (CZOP) also showed a relatively strong activity against S. epidermidis (MIC90: 4 to 8 micrograms/ml). Against Escherichia coli, carbapenems showed high activities: meropenem (MEPM) prevented growth of all strains within 0.125 microgram/ml; IPM prevented growth of all strains with 0.25 microgram/ml. CZOP and CTM also showed strong activities against E. coli: MIC90 of CZOP was within 0.125 microgram/ml; MIC80 and MIC90 of CTM were 0.25 and 0.5 microgram/ml, respectively. Quinolone resistant E. coli was detected at frequency of 14.0%, which was significantly higher than that in the last year. Almost all drugs showed strong activities against Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis, and MEPM prevented growth of all strains within 0.125 microgram/ml. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, almost drugs were not so active. The MIC90 of carbapenems and gentamicin (GM) were 16 micrograms/ml and those of all other drugs were more than 32 micrograms/ml. Against Serratia marcescens, the MIC90 of IPM and GM were the lowest value being 2 micrograms/ml, and that of MEPM was 4 micrograms/ml.
TI  - Gastric colonisation, intestinal permeability and septic morbidity in acute pancreatitis.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Bacterial translocation (BT) may represent an important cause of septic morbidity in patients with acute pancreatitis. We have previously demonstrated an association between BT, septic morbidity and colonisation of the proximal GI tract. Alterations in intestinal permeability (IP) may also predispose to BT. The aim of this study was to assess the extent of gastric colonisation, measure IP in patients with acute pancreatitis and relate these to both disease severity and septic complications. METHODS: Gastric colonisation was determined by culturing a sample of nasogastric aspirate, and IP was measured using a dual sugar probe technique (lactulose/rhamnose test). Disease severity was assessed according to the modified Glasgow (Imrie) criteria. All septic complications were recorded prospectively. RESULTS: A total of 59 patients were studied (M:F ratio 32:27, median age 66 years, range 18-89), 24 (31%) of whom had severe disease. A nasogastric aspirate was obtained in 56 patients. There was a significantly higher incidence of colonisation with potentially pathogenic enteric bacteria in patients with severe disease compared to those with mild disease (57 vs. 6%, p < 0.001). Septic morbidity occurred in 29% of severe patients and 11% mild patients (p = 0.17). 33% of patients colonised with enteric organisms developed sepsis, compared to 16% with no enteric bacteria in the NG aspirate (p = 0.34). Enteric bacteria caused 77% of the septic complications. Intestinal permeability was neither associated with disease severity nor was it predictive of septic morbidity. CONCLUSIONS: There is significantly higher incidence of gastric colonisation with enteric bacteria in patients with severe acute pancreatitis, but no difference in IP. Enteric bacteria were implicated in the majority of septic complications. These findings support the gut origin of sepsis hypothesis in acute pancreatitis.
TI  - Evaluation of a poly(vinyl pyrollidone)-coated biomaterial for urological use.
AB  - The associated problems of bacterial biofilm formation and encrustation that may  cause obstruction or blockage of urethral catheters and ureteral stents often hinders the effective use of biomaterials within the urinary tract. In this in vitro study, we have investigated the surface properties of a hydrophilic poly(vinyl pyrollidone) (PVP)-coating applied to polyurethane and determined its suitability for use as a urinary tract biomaterial by comparing its lubricity and ability to resist bacterial adherence and encrustation with that of uncoated polyurethane and silicone. The PVP-coated polyurethane was significantly more hydrophilic and more lubricious than either uncoated polyurethane or silicone. Adherence of a hydrophilic Escherichia coli isolate to PVP-coated polyurethane and uncoated polyurethane was similar but significantly less than adherence to silicone. Adherence of a hydrophobic Enterococcus faecalis isolate to PVP-coated polyurethane and silicone was similar but was significantly less than adherence to uncoated polyurethane. Struvite encrustation was similar on the PVP-coated polyurethane and silicone but significantly less than on uncoated polyurethane. Furthermore, hydroxyapatite encrustation was significantly less on the PVP-coated polyurethane than on either uncoated polyurethane or silicone. The results suggest that the PVP-coating could be useful in preventing complications caused by bacterial biofilm formation and the deposition of encrustation on biomaterials implanted in the urinary tract and, therefore, warrants further evaluation.
TI  - Virulence effect of Enterococcus faecalis protease genes and the quorum-sensing locus fsr in Caenorhabditis elegans and mice.
AB  - The expression of two Enterococcus faecalis extracellular virulence-related proteins, gelatinase (GelE) and serine protease (SprE), has been shown to be positively regulated by the fsr quorum-sensing system. We recently developed a novel system for studying E. faecalis pathogenicity that involves killing of the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans and showed that an E. faecalis fsrB mutant (strain TX5266) exhibited attenuated killing. We explore here the role of the fsr/gelE-sprE locus in pathogenicity by comparing results obtained in the nematode system with a mouse peritonitis model of E. faecalis infection. Insertion mutants of fsrA (TX5240) and fsrC (TX5242), like fsrB (TX5266), were attenuated in their ability to kill C. elegans. A deletion mutant of gelE (TX5264) and an insertion mutant of sprE (TX5243) were also attenuated in C. elegans killing, although to a lesser extent than the fsr mutants. Complementation of fsrB (TX5266) with a 6-kb fragment containing the entire fsr locus restored virulence in both the nematode and the mouse peritonitis models. The fsr mutants were not impaired in their ability to colonize the nematode intestine. These data show that extracellular proteases and the quorum-sensing fsr system are important for E. faecalis virulence in two highly divergent hosts: nematodes and mice.
TI  - Chemical constituents and antimicrobial activity of the essential oil of Lantana  xenica.
AB  - The aim of this work was to evaluate the chemical composition of Lantana xenica essential oil and its antimicrobial activity. The oil from the aerial parts of Lantana xenica Mold. (Verbenacea) was obtained by steam distillation and analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The major constituent of the oil was (E)-caryophyllene (35.2 %), with minor amounts of gamma-cadinene (13.3 %), alpha-pinene (9.3 %), ocimene (9.2 %) and germacrene D (6.6 %). The antimicrobial assays showed that the essential oil of L. xenica inhibited the growth of Bacillus cereus and Proteus mirabilis and both bacteria were inhibited by (E)-caryophyllene, the major component of the oil. Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus epidermidis and S. aureus showed a lower inhibition. The bacteria Micrococcus luteus, Klebsiella sp., Escherichia coli and the yeast Candida albicans were insensitive to both the oil and (E)-caryophyllene.
TI  - The antibacterial activity of topical retinoids: the case of retinaldehyde.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Retinoids such as retinoic acid (RA), retinol (ROL) and retinaldehyde (RAL) are currently used in many formulations and indications ranging form acne to skin aging. Most if not all their pharmacological activities occur through binding to nuclear receptors with subsequent modulation of the activities of several genes. Little attention has been given to the many other potential actions on the surface of the skin. AIM: To analyse the potential anti-infective activities of topical ROL, RAL and RA. METHODS: Microbial minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of ROL, RAL and RA were determined by a microdilution method on reference strains including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Micrococcus flavus, Propionibacterium acnes, Micrococcus luteus, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus hominis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans and 133 clinical strains including methicillin-resistant S. aureus, methicillin-sensitive S. aureus, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, Streptococcus group B, Enterococcus faecalis, vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis, vancomycin-resistant E. faecium and Pseudomonas/Klebsiella. In two clinical trials in healthy human volunteers, skin bacterial densities were evaluated in samples obtained with the cylinder scrub method: (1). 2 and 5 h after a single application of 0.05% RAL or vehicle on the forearm and (2). in a single-blind randomized study where 0.05% RAL or vehicle were applied daily for 2 weeks on the forehead of 22 volunteers. Paired results from treated (or vehicle) and untreated areas were analysed. RESULTS: Of the three retinoids tested, only RAL showed a significant in vitro antibacterial activity; this activity was found against reference strains of gram-positive bacteria like S. aeureus, Micrococcus spp. or P. acnes. No activity was found against gram-negative bacteria. These results on reference strains were confirmed on 133 clinical isolates. MIC(50) and MIC(90) values for RAL were 8 and 16 mg/l, respectively, for methicillin-sensitive S. aureus and 4 and 8 mg/l for methicillin-resistant S. aureus. The two in vivo studies showed that areas treated with RAL had a significant decrease in the bacterial counts. In the forehead study, the median decrease was 10(2) log/cm(2) for P. acnes and 10(1.8) log/cm(2) for staphylococci. No resistant bacteria were found after 2 weeks of topical use. Preliminary results suggest that the antibacterial effect of RAL is due, in part, to the aldehyde group in the lateral chain, since non-retinoid pseudo-analogues of the chain, like citral and hexenal, showed a similar antibacterial activity. CONCLUSION: We have shown that RAL differs from parent natural retinoids such as ROL and RA in demonstrating significant antibacterial activities upon topical use. This activity is likely due to the aldehyde group in the isoprenoic lateral chain, which illustrates the potential bifunctional properties of some retinoids.
TI  - Evaluation of the antimicrobial potential of medicinal plants from the Ivory Coast.
AB  - A total of 148 crude ethanol extracts from 115 plant species were tested in vitro against Gram-negative strains (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and the Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis. Moreover, they were submitted to antifungal assays against Candida albicans and Cladosporium cucumerinum, a human and a plant pathogenic microorganism, respectively, known to be good indicators of antifungal activity. No activity was detected against the Gram-negative bacteria, while 14.8% and 10.8% of the extracts showed Gram-positive bactericidal or bacteriostatic effects on S. aureus and E. faecalis, respectively. An antifungal activity was observed with 15 extracts (10.1%). Two species were particularly active against the fungi: Dioscorea minutiflora and Erythrina vogelii. The young tubers of D. minutiflora contain metabolites with a specific effect on fungi and were not active against the bacteria. On the other hand, E. vogelii was highly effective against the Gram-positive bacteria and the fungi.
TI  - Vaginal microbiota in healthy pregnant women and prenatal screening of group B streptococci (GBS).
AB  - The microbiota of the lower female genital tract was evaluated from vaginal swabs obtained from 623 healthy pregnant women at gestation periods of 35-40 weeks. Isolated and identified microorganisms were expressed as percentages of total samples. As expected, lactobacilli made up the dominant vaginal microbiota (70%). Enterobacteriaceae, mainly Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp. and Proteus, were present in 38% of the samples, which might reflect the possible contamination of vaginal tract with rectal microorganisms. Candida albicans was present in 10% of healthy pregnant woman assayed. Streptoccocci (Streptococcus sp. and Enterococcus faecalis with 3% and 4%, respectively) and other gram-positive cocci (Staphylococcus sp., 5%), along with other microorgansisms such as Gardnerella vaginalis (5%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2%) may represent a potential infection risk. Streptococcus agalactiae (group B streptococci beta-hemolytic, GBS) was detected in 7% of the samples. GBS infection is a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality in the developed world. Furthermore, GBS was often co-isolated with C. albicans (54.5%) in the samples. A complete and detailed evaluation of the vaginal biota swab, with particular attention to the presence of potential pathogens such as GBS, is a preventive strategy that can provide useful information to obstetricians and gynecologist in managing the last days of pregnancy and delivery.
TI  - Two novel oligosaccharides formed by 1F-fructosyltransferase purified from roots  of asparagus (Asparagus officinalis L.).
AB  - Two novel oligosaccharides, tetra-and penta-saccharides were synthesized by fructosyl transfer from 1-kestose to 4G-beta-D-galactopyranosylsucrose with a purified 1F-fructosyltransferase of asparagus roots and identified as 1F-beta-D-fructofuranosyl-4G-beta-D-galactopyranosylsucrose, O-beta-D-fructofuranosyl-(2-->1)-beta-D-fructofuranosyl-O-[beta-D-galactopyranosy l-(1-->4)]-alpha-D-glucopyranoside and 1F(1-beta-D-fructofuranosyl)2-4G-beta-D-galactopyranosylsucrose, [O-beta-D-fructofuranosyl-(2-->1)]2-beta-D-fructofuranosyl-O-[beta-D-galactopyran osyl-(1-->4)]-alpha-D-glucopyranoside, respectively. Both oligosaccharides were scarcely hydrolyzed by carbohydrase from rat small intestine. Human intestinal bacterial growth by 1F-beta-D-fructofuranosyl-4G-beta-D-galactopyranosylsucrose was compared with that by the tetrasaccharides, stachyose and nystose. Bifidobacteria utilized 1F-beta-D-fructofuranosyl-4G-beta-D-galactopyranosylsucrose to the same extent as stachyose or nystose. On the other hand, the unfavorable bacteria, Clostridium perfringens, Escherichia coli and Enterococcusfaecalis, that produce mutagenic substances did not use the synthetic oligosaccharide.
TI  - Bacterial inactivation by high-pressure homogenisation and high hydrostatic pressure.
AB  - The resistance of five gram-positive bacteria, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Lactobacillus plantarum, Listeria innocua and Leuconostoc dextranicum, and six gram-negative bacteria, Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, Shigella flexneri, Yersinia enterocolitica, Pseudomonas fluorescens and two strains of Escherichia coli, to high-pressure homogenisation (100-300 MPa) and to high hydrostatic pressure (200-400 MPa) was compared in this study. Within the group of gram-positive bacteria and within the group of gram-negative bacteria, large differences were observed in resistance to high hydrostatic pressure, but not to high-pressure homogenisation. All gram-positive bacteria were more resistant than any of the gram-negative bacteria to high-pressure homogenisation, while in relative to high hydrostatic pressure resistance both groups overlapped. Within the group of gram-negative bacteria, there also existed another order in resistance to high-pressure homogenisation than to high hydrostatic pressure. Further it appears that the mutant E. coli LMM1010, which is resistant to high hydrostatic pressure is not more resistant to high-pressure homogenisation than its parental strain MG1655. The preceding observations indicate a different response of the test bacteria to high-pressure homogenisation compared to high hydrostatic pressure treatment, which suggests that the underlying inactivation mechanisms for both techniques are different. Further, no sublethal injury could be observed upon high-pressure homogenisation of Y. enterocolitica and S. aureus cell population by using low pH (5.5 7), NaCl (0 6%) or SDS (0-100 mg/l) as selective components in the plating medium. Finally, it was observed that successive rounds of high-pressure homogenisation have an additive effect on viability reduction of Y. enterocolitica and S. aureus.
TI  - Bacterial survival on radiographic cassettes.
AB  - The purpose of this investigation was to report the life span of Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus on 3 types of radiographic imaging receptors currently used in diagnostic imaging departments in the United States. Kodak 400 speed, Dupont 400 speed and Fuji computed radiography cassettes were inoculated with the 3 bacteria, then placed in an incubation cabinet and cultured for a period of 2 weeks. All 3 cassettes revealed confluent growth with no noticeable reduction in bacterial numbers for the entire test period. This study verifies that common potentially pathogenic bacteria can survive for prolonged periods on radiographic imaging cassettes. Therefore, effective cleaning regimens are of fundamental importance in controlling and preventing potential nosocomial transmission in the diagnostic imaging department.
TI  - DNA amplification and hybridization assays in integrated plastic monolithic devices.
AB  - PCR amplification, DNA hybridization, and a hybridization wash have been integrated in a disposable monolithic DNA device, containing all of the necessary fluidic channels and reservoirs. These integrated devices were fabricated in polycarbonate plastic material by CO2 laser machining and were assembled using a combination of thermal bonding and adhesive tape bonding. Pluronics polymer phase change valves were implemented in the devices to fulfill the valving requirements. Pluronics polymer material is PCR compatible, and 30% Pluronics polymer valves provide enough holding pressure to ensure a successful PCR amplification. By reducing the temperature locally, to approximately 5 degrees C, Pluronics valves were liquefied and easily opened. A hybridization channel was made functional by oligonucleotide deposition, using Motorola proprietary surface attachment chemistry. Reagent transport on the device was provided by syringe pumps, which were docked onto the device. Peltier thermal electrical devices powered the heating and cooling functionality of the device. Asymmetrical PCR amplification and subsequent hybridization detection of both Escherichia coli K-12 MG1655 and Enterococcus faecalis DNAE genes have been successfully demonstrated in these disposable monolithic devices.
TI  - Influence of mucin on the activity of the antiseptic Lavasept against Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lavasept, containing the polymeric biguanide polyhexanide, may be effective against Staphylococcus aureus colonizing the nasal mucosa. To obtain basic data on its suitability for that purpose, its antimicrobial activity was examined in the presence of mucin. METHODS: A disk diffusion test was applied using Mueller-Hinton agar, and disks soaked with a therapeutic and a 10-fold higher concentration of Lavasept. Commercially available mucin preparations from porcine stomach were added to the test system. Reference strains and 20 clinically isolates of S. aureus, and reference strains of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, and Candida albicans were tested. RESULTS: Supplementation of the test medium with 1% mucin completely abolished the activity of disks loaded with the therapeutically used concentration of the antiseptic. The neutralizing effect of mucin occurred with all test strains. CONCLUSIONS: The inactivation of Lavasept by mucin may hamper a reliable clearance of nasal S. aureus carriage.
TI  - Damage-repair error-prone polymerases of eubacteria: association with mobile genome elements.
AB  - It is known that umuDC-like operons encoding DNA polymerase V are often found in  plasmids of gamma-proteobacteria. Here we demonstrate that homologous operons are associated with mobile genomic elements in Gram-positive bacteria as well. Using the comparative analysis of transcriptional regulatory signals, we suggest that genes encoding homologs of UmuC in prophages of Bacillus subtilis and transposons of Enterococus faecalis are regulated by DinR (SOS repressor). We also predict a functional link between the polymerase V-like proteins of B. subtilis and the protein family containing YolD, YozL and YqjX.
TI  - Transfer origins in the conjugative Enterococcus faecalis plasmids pAD1 and pAM373: identification of the pAD1 nic site, a specific relaxase and a possible TraG-like protein.
AB  - The Enterococcus faecalis conjugative plasmids pAD1 and pAM373 encode a mating response to the peptide sex pheromones cAD1 and cAM373 respectively. Sequence determination of both plasmids has recently been completed with strong similarity evident over many of the structural genes related to conjugation. pAD1 has two origins of transfer, with oriT1 being located within the repA determinant, whereas the more efficiently utilized oriT2 is located between orf53 and orf57, two genes found in the present study to be essential for conjugation. We have found a similarly located oriT to be present in pAM373. oriT2 corresponds to about 285 bp based on its ability to facilitate mobilization by pAD1 when ligated to the shuttle vector pAM401; however, it was not mobilized by pAM373. In contrast, a similarly ligated fragment containing the oriT of pAM373 did not facilitate mobilization by pAD1 but was efficiently mobilized by pAM373. The oriT sites of the two plasmids each contained a homologous large inverted repeat (spanning about 140 bp) adjacent to a series of non-homologous short (6 bp) direct repeats. A hybrid construction containing the inverted repeat of pAM373 and direct repeats of pAD1 was mobilized efficiently by pAD1 but not by pAM373, indicating a significantly greater degree of specificity is associated with the direct repeats. Mutational (deletion) analyses of the pAD1 oriT2 inverted repeat structure suggested its importance in facilitating transfer or perhaps ligation of the ends of the newly transferred DNA strand. Analyses showed that Orf57 (to be called TraX) is the relaxase, which was found to induce a specific nick in the large inverted repeat inside oriT; the protein also facilitated site-specific recombination between two oriT2 sites. Orf53 (to be called TraW) exhibits certain structural similarities to TraG-like proteins, although there is little overall homology.
TI  - Prevalence of and resistance to anti-microbial drugs in selected microbial species isolated from bulk milk samples.
AB  - The prevalence of strains of Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative (CN) staphylococci, Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, E. faecium and Bacillus cereus, was investigated in 111 bulk milk samples. Staphylococcus aureus was isolated from 38 samples, CN staphylococci from 63 samples, E. coli from 49 samples, E. faecalis or E. faecium from 107 samples, and L. monocytogenes from two samples. Bacillus cereus was not found in any of the samples and three samples were free of any of the selected species. Sensitivity to the anti-microbial drugs amikacin, ampicillin, ampicillin + sulbactam, cephalothin (CLT), cephotaxime, clindamycin, chloramphenicol (CMP), co-trimoxazole, erythromycin (ERY), gentamicin, neomycin, norfloxacin, oxacillin, penicillin, streptomycin (STR), tetracycline (TTC) and vancomycin was tested using the standard dilution technique. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) characteristics (MIC50, MIC90, MIC range) were determined for each microbial species. Resistance against one or more anti-microbial drugs was found in 93% of S. aureus, 40% of CN staphylococci, 73% of E. coli, 88% of E.faecalis, 55% of E.faecium, and one L. monocytogenes strain. Most of the strains, particularly enterococci, were resistant to STR, TTC, and ERY (MIC50 4 microg/ml). A high percentage of staphylococci were resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics. High resistance to CLT was found in 11 strains of E. coli (MIC 256 microg/ml) and strains resistant to CMP (MIC90 16 microg/ml) were detected. The highest numbers of resistance phenotypes were found in E. coil (16) and CN staphylococci (12). Eighteen identical resistance phenotypes were demonstrated in indicator bacteria (E. coli, E. faecalis, E. faecium) and pathogens (S. aureus, CN staphylococci) isolated from the same bulk milk sample. The obtained resistance data were matched against the herd owners' information on therapeutic use of the drugs. This confrontation could not explain the findings of strains resistant to ERY or CMP. Our findings are evidence of selection of resistant strains among not only pathogenic agents, but also among indicator bacteria which can become significant carriers of transmissible resistance genes.
TI  - Remarkable substituent effects on antimicrobial activities of 1,3-diorganylimidazolidinium salts.
AB  - In vitro antibacterial and antifungal activities of a series of 25 diazolidinium  salts, 1,3-diorganylimidazolidinium (1), together with 1,3-dialkylpyrimidinium (2), were evaluated against standard strains: Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), Staphylococcus epidermidis (ATCC 12228), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 29213), Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29212), Enterobacter cloacae (ATCC 13047), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853) and Candida albicans (ATCC 10239). Selective and effective antibacterial activity against one gram-negative (P. aeruginosa) and two gram-positive (E. faecalis and S. aureus) bacteria were found in salts 1a, 1i and 1j, in contrast to modest to poor activity observed in the rest of the salts. The enhanced antibacterial activity is clearly linked to the introduction of two bulky mesityl or mesitylbenzyl substituents on the nitrogen atoms of the imidazoline skeleton, while the side chain of the backbone of the molecule has no influence.
TI  - Bacterial enteropathogens and factors associated with seasonal episodes of gastroenteritis in Nsukka, Nigeria.
AB  - Each year, between April and October, many children of school age and some young  adults in Nsukka, Nigeria suffer from gastroenteritis. The period covers the rainy season in this part of Africa, when manured farmland occasionally is flooded. In view of the number of people suffering diarrhoea and occasionally low-grade fever, it became necessary to investigate the nature of the bacterial agents responsible. Between April and October (1996-1998), 500 loose or watery stools were collected from patients, the ages of which ranged from one month to 31 years. Stools that contained parasites were excluded from the study. Samples were cultured on 5% blood agar and 1% egg-yolk agar (both containing 10 microg/mL ampicillin), MacConkey agar, Shigella Salmonella agar and in alkaline peptone water. Bacterial growths were identified using standard bacteriological procedures. Drinking water and some fruit and vegetables prevalent during this period of the year also were cultured. Of the 500 stool samples tested, 138 (27.6%) grew a range of organisms including Aeromonas hydrophila (65 [13%]), Salmonella spp. (55 [11%]), Shigella spp. (9 [1.8%]) and enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (9 [1.8%]). Drinking water and some vegetables grew Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus faecalis, respectively. The highest isolation rate occurred during June and July, corresponding to the period of greatest flooding of arable land. Although no enteropathogens were isolated from the fruit and vegetables examined, they contained E. faecalis--an organism found in faeces. Our findings failed to explain why 72% of the samples grew no bacterial enteropathogens.
TI  - Enterococcus faecalis 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A synthase, an enzyme of isopentenyl diphosphate biosynthesis.
AB  - Biosynthesis of the isoprenoid precursor isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) proceeds via two distinct pathways. Sequence comparisons and microbiological data suggest that multidrug-resistant strains of gram-positive cocci employ exclusively the mevalonate pathway for IPP biosynthesis. Bacterial mevalonate pathway enzymes therefore offer potential targets for development of active site-directed inhibitors for use as antibiotics. We used the PCR and Enterococcus faecalis genomic DNA to isolate the mvaS gene that encodes 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) synthase, the second enzyme of the mevalonate pathway. mvaS was expressed in Escherichia coli from a pET28 vector with an attached N-terminal histidine tag. The expressed enzyme was purified by affinity chromatography on Ni(2+)-agarose to apparent homogeneity and a specific activity of 10 micromol/min/mg. Analytical ultracentrifugation showed that the enzyme is a dimer (mass, 83.9 kDa; s(20,w), 5.3). Optimal activity occurred in 2.0 mM MgCl(2) at 37(o)C. The DeltaH(a) was 6,000 cal. The pH activity profile, optimum activity at pH 9.8, yielded a pK(a) of 8.8 for a dissociating group, presumably Glu78. The stoichiometry per monomer of acetyl-CoA binding was 1.2 +/- 0.2 and that of covalent acetylation was 0.60 +/- 0.02. The K(m) for the hydrolysis of acetyl-CoA was 10 microM. Coupled conversion of acetyl-CoA to mevalonate was demonstrated by using HMG-CoA synthase and acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase/HMG-CoA reductase from E. faecalis.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of citrate and acetate.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We evaluated citrate salt, acetate salt, and their combinations for antibacterial activity against a sample of common pathogens. METHODS: Bacterial suspensions were added to serial microdilutions of the salts in broth, with final cell concentrations of 10(4-5) colony-forming units per milliliter. After overnight incubation at 35 degrees C, the minimum inhibitory concentration was recorded. Bactericidal activity was screened by quantitative subcultures from the minimum inhibitory concentration dilution. RESULTS: Citrate salt was active against gram-positive species and Candida albicans but showed little activity against gram-negative species; acetate salt showed the opposite results. Their combination did not show synergism or antagonism. CONCLUSION: It may be feasible to take advantage of the different antibacterial spectra of these two agents and combine them for possible application such as food or medical preservative agents.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance as an indicator of bacterial chlorhexidine susceptibility.
AB  - The antibiotic and chlorhexidine (CHX) susceptibility of 70 distinct clinical isolates: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus (not MRSA), Streptococcus pyogenes and Enterococcus faecalis (10 of each) were tested using minimal bactericidal (MBC) and/or minimal inhibitory (MIC) concentrations. Non-fermentative bacteria tolerated CHX at high concentrations; Gram-positive cocci, especially S. pyogenes, were the most susceptible. We found a good correlation between CHX and antibiotic susceptibility in both MIC and MBC among Gram-negative bacteria, and mainly in MBC among Gram-positive bacteria. Resistance to ciprofloxacin, imipenem, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, gentamicin and aztreonam appeared to indicate increased CHX resistance among Gram-negative bacteria. This finding gives clinicians the ability to predict CHX susceptibility according to routine antibiotic resistance testing.
TI  - In vitro bactericidal activity of piperacillin, gentamicin, and metronidazole in  a mixed model containing Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, and Bacteroides fragilis.
AB  - An anaerobic, mixed model assay was used to study the bactericidal activities of  piperacillin, gentamicin, and metronidazole, alone and in double- and triple-antibiotic combinations against a polymicrobial suspension of E. coli, E. faecalis, and B. fragilis. Only slight differences were noted with the agents when tested against single (10(5) cfu/mL inoculum) versus polymicrobic suspensions (10(6) cfu/mL final inoculum) of susceptible and resistant organisms. Contrary to previous reports in the literature, metronidazole was not active against E. coli in an anaerobic environment (even in the presence of B. fragilis) nor was the activity of metronidazole reduced against B. fragilis in the presence of E. faecalis. Gentamicin demonstrated excellent activity against E. coli when tested in a Bactron anaerobic chamber (5% hydrogen, 5% CO(2,) 90% nitrogen). The pH of the media was only reduced to 6.3-6.7, considerably higher than the pH range of 5-6 needed to significantly reduce the activity of aminoglycosides.
TI  - The antimicrobial properties of milkfat after partial hydrolysis by calf pregastric lipase.
AB  - Studies on the kinetic characteristics of calf pregastric lipase (EC 3.1.1.3) have shown that it preferentially releases short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) from bovine milkfat. The released fatty acids form mixed micelle structures. The aim of this investigation has been to test whether hydrolysed milkfat is antimicrobial, and how the state of the emulsion alters the bactericidal or bacteriostatic effects. Partial hydrolysis of milkfat by pregastric lipase was carried out in two types of emulsion systems, containing either Triton X-100 or casein/lecithin, plus milkfat in citrate/phosphate buffer (pH 5.0-6.0). The concentrations and compositions of fatty acids were determined by gas chromatography. The minimum percentages of hydrolysed milkfat which affected growth and survival of selected Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria were measured. The bacterial experiments were repeated using pure fatty acids at similar concentrations. Lauric acid (C12:0) was found to be the most potent bactericidal fatty acid against Enterococcae (Gram-positive), and caprylic acid (C8:0) was the most potent against coliforms (Gram-negative). Use of Triton X-100 for milkfat emulsification provided a more compatible medium for studying bacterial growth in the hydrolysed milkfat than did use of casein/lecithin. The results also show that the antimicrobial effects of individual fatty acids released from hydrolysed milkfat were at least additive and suggest that hydrolysis of milkfat may be a significant factor in controlling growth of organisms imbibed with food in pre-weaned animals. The amount of pregastric catalyzed triglyceride hydrolysis in the digestive tract is sufficient to produce an antibacterial concentration of fatty acids and monoglycerides.
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial activities of N-substituted imides.
AB  - In the field of our research programs concerning novel antimicrobial agents, a series of N-substituted imides was synthesized. These compounds were obtained by cyclization of amido-acids in acetic anhydride/sodium acetate or hexamethyldisilazane/zinc bromide for the hydroxy-aromatic derivatives. The hydroxy-alkyl maleimides were directly prepared by condensation of the corresponding amino-alcohol with maleic anhydride in boiling toluene. Most of N-substituted maleimides showed an interesting antimicrobial activity towards bacteria from the ATCC collection (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853) but the MIC values for P. aeruginosa were always high (128 microg/ml). The imides with alkyl substituents showed higher activities than aromatic analogues with MIC values in the range of 8-32 microg/ml. Comparatively, succinimides were practically inactive.
TI  - Enterococcus faecalis induces inflammatory bowel disease in interleukin-10 knockout mice.
AB  - Germ-free interleukin-10 knockout (IL-10 KO) mice developed inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) after they were colonized with a pure culture of Enterococcus faecalis. E. faecalis not only induced IBD (primarily in colon and rectum) but rectal dysplasia and adenocarcinoma was also found in the IL-10 KO mice. Conventional (complex-intestinal flora) IL-10 KO mice developed IBD within 10 to 15 weeks of age and showed more pathology in the cecum (typhlitis) than we observed with E. faecalis-induced IBD in gnotobiotic IL-10 KO mice. Conversely, neither germ-free IL-10 mice nor IL-10 KO mice colonized as adults, with a pure culture of Candida albicans, Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus casei, L. reuteri, L. acidophilus, a Bifidobacterium sp., Lactococcus lactis, or a Bacillus sp. developed IBD during the 25- to 30-week study. E. faecalis is a common intestinal microbe of man and animals that can trigger IBD, dysplasia, and carcinoma in a genetically susceptible murine host.
TI  - Comparative modelling and immunochemical reactivity of Escherichia coli UMP kinase.
AB  - Bacterial UMP kinases do not exhibit any sequence homology with other nucleoside  monophosphate kinases described so far, and appear under oligomeric forms, submitted to complex regulation by nucleotides. We propose here a structural model of UMP kinase from Escherichia coli based on the conservation of the fold of carbamate kinase whose crystal structure was recently solved. Despite sequence identity of only 18% over 203 amino acids, alignment of UMP kinase from E. coli with carbamate kinase from Enterococcus faecalis by hydrophobic cluster analysis and threading suggested the conservation of the overall structure, except for a small subdomain (absent in UMP kinase). The modelled dimer suggested conservation of the dimer interface observed in carbamate kinase while interaction of UMP kinase with a monoclonal antibody (Mab 44-2) suggests a three in-plane dimer subunit arrangement. The model was analyzed in light of various modified forms of UMP kinase obtained by site-directed mutagenesis.
TI  - [Evaluation of microecology of colonic contents in patients with chronic pancreatitis].
AB  - The paper deals with microbiocenosis in the colonic content in 60 patients with chronic pancreatitis during its exacerbation. An analysis has indicated that in the colonic content there are the following microorganisms: Bifidobacterium sp., 10(8)-10(10) CFU/g; Lactobacillus sp., 10(1)-10(5) CFU/g; Escherichia coli, 10(8)-10(10) CFU/g; Enterococcus faecalis, 10(6)-10(10) CFU/g; Enterococcus faecium, 10(6)-10(10) CFU/g; the family Enterobacteriaceae (mainly Klebsiella-Enterobacter sp.), 10(1)-10(6) CFU/g; yeasty (including the Candida genus) and mold fungi, 10(1)-10(5)/g; Staphylococci, 10(1)-10(3) CFU/g. Comparing the findings with those of normal cenosis according to different authors' data suggests that there are no apparently impairments in the levels of some microoranisms, the representives of microbiocenosis in the colonic content in the examinees.
TI  - An in vitro assay to evaluate competitive exclusion products for poultry.
AB  - An in vitro assay was developed to measure the ability of competitive exclusion (CE) bacteria to protect Caco-2 and CRL-2117 epithelial cells from invasion by Salmonella Typhimurium. The proposed assay is needed to expedite the development of defined-flora CE products. The average significantly protective concentration of the commercial poultry-specific CE product Preempt was 4.05 log CFU/6.41 log human Caco-2 cells and 3.71 log CFU/6.89 log CFU chicken CRL-2117 cells, Enterococcus faecalis isolated from Preempt protected CRL-2117 cells, Escherichia coli isolates protected Caco-2 cells, Lactococcus lactis and Bacteroides distasonis isolates protected both cell lines, and three species of Lactobacillus isolates failed to protect either cell line. A defined mixture of 29 strains of bacteria similar to the constituents of Preempt protected both cell lines from Salmonella invasion at a concentration of 7.83 log CFU. The constituents of the defined CE culture were separated into mixtures of obligate (8.42 log CFU) and facultative (8.49 log CFU) anaerobes, which both protected the cell lines, suggesting that both types of bacteria were equally protective. Although not a substitute for in vivo testing, the in vitro CE assay is a rapid technique for the evaluation of bacterial mixtures for potential CE products.
TI  - Strategies for evaluating the sanitary quality of composting.
AB  - AIMS: To evaluate different strategies for description of the sanitary quality of industrial-scale composting. METHODS AND RESULTS: The investigation included microbiological analyses of waste at different stages during the process (spot test analysis), as well as physical and chemical parameters. The elimination of indicator organisms was also investigated by means of direct process evaluation, based on inoculation of the waste. At the four investigated facilities, the sanitary process was very efficient when evaluated by the direct process evaluation, indicated by an efficient elimination of Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis inoculated into the waste. The sanitization was poor when evaluated by spot test analysis at the two windrow facilities, while good agreement was found at the two in-vessel facilities. CONCLUSIONS: The direct process evaluation is a valuable tool for identifying parameters for process optimization in different zones and for measuring elimination patterns of pathogens not normally present in the waste, but it is unreliable for evaluating the overall sanitary process. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The spot test analysis is an accurate method for the analysis of the sanitary process. In addition, it is simple and inexpensive to perform, which makes it very cost-effective for supervision of the sanitary quality of industrial-scale composting.
TI  - Identification and characterization of genes encoding sex pheromone cAM373 activity in Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - The sex pheromone cAM373 of Enterococcus faecalis and the related staph-cAM373 of Staphylococcus aureus were found to correspond to heptapeptides located within the C-termini of the signal sequences of putative prelipoproteins. The deduced mature forms of the lipoproteins share no detectable homology and presumably serve unrelated functions in the cells. The chromosomally encoded genetic determinants for production of the pheromones have been identified and designated camE (encoding cAM373) and camS (encoding staph-cAM373). Truncated and full-length clones of camE were generated in Escherichia coli, in which cAM373 activity was expressed. In E. faecalis, insertional inactivation in the middle of camE had no detectable phenotypic effects on the pheromone system. Establishment of an in frame translation stop codon within the signal sequence resulted in reduction of cAM373 activity to 3% of normal levels. The camS determinant has homologues in Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacillus subtilis and Listeria monocytogenes; however, corresponding heptapeptides present within those sequences do not resemble staph-cAM373 closely. The particular significance of staph-cAM373 as a potential intergeneric inducer of transfer-proficient genetic elements is discussed.
TI  - Subgingival microbiota of Brazilian subjects with untreated chronic periodontitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Different periodontopathogenic microbiota have been associated with periodontal diseases in several populations. The present investigation determined the subgingival microbiota of untreated chronic periodontitis Brazilians using the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization technique. METHODS: Twenty-five periodontitis patients (mean age, 41 +/- 2; mean probing depth [PD], 3.3 +/- 0.2; mean attachment level [AL], 3.6 +/- 0.2) with no history of previous periodontal therapy and a control group of 14 healthy subjects (mean age, 34 +/- 0.6; mean PD, 1.8 +/- 0.2; mean AL, 1.7 +/- 0.1) were selected. Measurements of PD, AL, bleeding on probing, plaque accumulation, and suppuration were recorded at 6 sites/tooth. Subgingival plaque samples were obtained from 4 sites in each tooth/subject in both groups. The presence and levels of 41 subgingival species were determined in 4,032 plaque samples using whole genomic DNA probes and the checkerboard method. RESULTS: Periodontal pathogens, as well as some unusual species (E. faecalis, E. coli and Bartonella sp.), were detected significantly more often and/or in higher levels in the periodontitis group (P < 0.05). Most species were more frequently detected in interproximal sites. B. forsythus, P. gingivalis, E. nodatum, and F. nucleatum ss vincentii showed a significant positive correlation with mean PD and AL (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The subgingival microbiota of Brazilians with untreated chronic periodontitis were complex, including high proportions of periodontopathogens commonly found in other populations, as well as some unusual species.
TI  - Antibody reactivity of a standardized human serum protein solution against a spectrum of microbial pathogens and toxins: comparison with fresh frozen plasma.
AB  - In this study, we compared a standardized solution of human serum protein (HSP) and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) with regard to the antibody specificity against a number of microbial pathogens and some important pathogenicity factors of bacterial pathogens. Due to the clinical use of HSP and FFP for therapeutical plasma exchange, we have chosen a spectrum of microbial pathogens for serological analysis that is critical in clinical settings. With the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique, we could show that HSP contains marked IgG antibody reactivity against antigens of Escherichia coli, Campylobacter jejuni, Enterobacter sakazakii, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Candida albicans. Although no IgM antibodies against the pathogens tested could be detected in HSP, moderate IgA reactivity was found against 4 of 12 microbial antigens. Immunoblot analysis demonstrated specific IgA and IgG responses against the endoproteinase Glu-C and the superantigens enterotoxin A and B of S. aureus, the IgA-protease of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Shiga toxin 2 of enterohemorrhagic E. coli. By using 3 different HSP batches in parallel, we could demonstrate antibody reactivity against important microbial pathogens and toxins. This antibody profile is essentially more homogeneous than that of 3 batches of FFP.
TI  - NB2001, a novel antibacterial agent with broad-spectrum activity and enhanced potency against beta-lactamase-producing strains.
AB  - Enzyme-catalyzed therapeutic activation (ECTA) is a novel prodrug strategy to overcome drug resistance resulting from enzyme overexpression. beta-Lactamase overexpression is a common mechanism of bacterial resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics. We present here the results for one of the beta-lactamase ECTA compounds, NB2001, which consists of the antibacterial agent triclosan in a prodrug form with a cephalosporin scaffold. Unlike conventional beta-lactam antibiotics, where hydrolysis of the beta-lactam ring inactivates the antibiotic, hydrolysis of NB2001 by beta-lactamase releases triclosan. Evidence supporting the proposed mechanism is as follows. (i) NB2001 is a substrate for TEM-1 beta-lactamase, forming triclosan with a second-order rate constant (k(cat)/K(m)) of greater than 77,000 M-1 s-1. (ii) Triclosan is detected in NB2001-treated, beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli but not in E. coli that does not express beta-lactamase. (iii) NB2001 activity against beta-lactamase-producing E. coli is decreased in the presence of the beta-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid. NB2001 was similar to or more potent than reference antibiotics against clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus (including MRSA), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, Moraxella catarrhalis and Haemophilus influenzae. NB2001 is also active against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Enterobacter cloacae. The results indicate that NB2001 is a potent, broad-spectrum antibacterial agent and demonstrate the potential of ECTA in overcoming beta-lactamase-mediated resistance.
TI  - [Can we rely on the results of urine microscopy and culture when tests are performed in general practice?].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Urinary tract infections (UTI) account for 2-5% of consultations in general practice, but only about half the patients with dysuria have significant bacteriuria (> 100,000 bacteria per ml). A microbiological diagnosis can be made by examination of a urine sample, and in Danish family practice the diagnosis of UTI is often reached by a microscopic analysis or a dip-slide culture test. These methods have a high validity when performed in hospital, but we need knowledge about the validity of microbiological urine examinations when performed in general practice. The aim of this study was to validate detection of bacteriuria by urine microscopy and dip-slide culture in general practice. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Urine specimens artificially produced by adding a known quantity of bacteria (Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis) to sterile urine were sent to 25 general practices for microscopic examination and dip-slide culture. No prior instruction in testing procedure was given. As the gold standard, the results of a standardised culture method performed by skilled laboratory technicians at the Department of Microbiology, University of Southern Denmark, were used. RESULTS: Significant bacteriuria was identified by microscopy with a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 83%. The corresponding figures for urine culture were 95% and 96%. The morphology of bacteria was interpreted correctly in 80% of microscopic examinations, and 60% of the bacteria strains were classified correctly in terms of their motility. DISCUSSION: The results of urine microscopy and culture performed in general practice are to be relied on.
TI  - Livestock issues. Overpowering manure.
AB  
TI  - Enterococcus faecalis acetoacetyl-coenzyme A thiolase/3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase, a dual-function protein of isopentenyl diphosphate biosynthesis.
AB  - Many bacteria employ the nonmevalonate pathway for synthesis of isopentenyl diphosphate, the monomer unit for isoprenoid biosynthesis. However, gram-positive cocci exclusively use the mevalonate pathway, which is essential for their growth (E. I. Wilding et al., J. Bacteriol. 182:4319-4327, 2000). Enzymes of the mevalonate pathway are thus potential targets for drug intervention. Uniquely, the enterococci possess a single open reading frame, mvaE, that appears to encode two enzymes of the mevalonate pathway, acetoacetyl-coenzyme A thiolase and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase. Western blotting revealed that the mvaE gene product is a single polypeptide in Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, and Enterococcus hirae. The mvaE gene was cloned from E. faecalis and was expressed with an N-terminal His tag in Escherichia coli. The gene product was then purified by nickel affinity chromatography. As predicted, the 86.5-kDa mvaE gene product catalyzed both the acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase and HMG-CoA reductase reactions. Temperature optima, DeltaH(a) and K(m) values, and pH optima were determined for both activities. Kinetic studies of acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase implicated a ping-pong mechanism. CoA acted as an inhibitor competitive with acetyl-CoA. A millimolar K(i) for a statin drug confirmed that E. faecalis HMG-CoA reductase is a class II enzyme. The oxidoreductant was NADP(H). A role for an active-site histidine during the first redox step of the HMG-CoA, reductase reaction was suggested by the ability of diethylpyrocarbonate to block formation of mevalonate from HMG-CoA, but not from mevaldehyde. Sequence comparisons with other HMG-CoA reductases suggest that the essential active-site histidine is His756. The mvaE gene product represents the first example of an HMG-CoA reductase fused to another enzyme.
TI  - In vitro action of carboxyfullerene.
AB  - Fullerene compounds have avid reactivity with free radicals and are regarded as 'radical sponges'. The trimalonic acid derivative of fullerene is one of the water-soluble compounds that has been synthesized and found to be an effective antioxidant both in vivo and in vitro. Carboxyfullerene has been shown to be effective in the treatment of both Gram-positive and -negative infections, although its mode of action is poorly understood. We determined the MIC and minimal bactericidal concentration of carboxyfullerene for 20 isolates, including Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus spp., Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi and Klebsiella pneumoniae. We further investigated the action of carboxyfullerene using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), anticarboxyfullerene antibody binding assay and a membrane perturbation assay. All Gram-positive species were inhibited by < or = 50 mg/L of carboxyfullerene, whereas Gram-negative species were not inhibited, even at 500 mg/L carboxyfullerene. Bactericidal activity was demonstrated only for Gram-positive species, particularly for Streptococcus pyogenes A-20, which was killed rapidly. Intercalation of carboxyfullerene into the cell wall of staphylococci and streptococci was demonstrated by TEM and anti-carboxyfullerene binding assay. Damage to the cell membrane in Gram-positive, but not Gram-negative, bacteria was confirmed by the membrane perturbation assay. These findings indicate that the action of carboxyfullerene on Gram-positive bacteria is achieved by insertion into the cell wall and destruction of membrane integrity.
TI  - Shima drinking water--a bacteriological analysis.
AB  - 300 water samples, 60 from piped supply and 240 from 20 natural sources were analyzed bacteriologically for four important bacterial indicators every month over a period of one year. The MPN of total coliforms, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus faecalis were detected by multiple tube method and Clostridium perfringens was isolated using litmus milk medium. From piped water supply, only one sample was found unfit for human consumption. The plate count at 37 degrees C and 22 degrees C varied from 0.5 x 10(3) to 15 x 10(3) per ml. of water. From natural sources, MPN indices for coliforms, Esch. coli and S. faecalis varied from 3 to > 1800, 0 to > 1800 and 0 to 540 per 100 ml. of water respectively. About 1/3rd of samples showed presence of Cl. perfringens. The plate count varied from 1.0 x 10(3) to > 150 x 10(3) per ml. of water. Salmonella typhi was isolated in 1.25% samples by membrane filtration technique. The water from all the natural sources was unfit for human consumption whereas piped water supply was of good quality in general.
TI  - Evidence that the enterococcal polysaccharide antigen gene (epa) cluster is widespread in Enterococcus faecalis and influences resistance to phagocytic killing of E. faecalis.
AB  - In previous studies, we cloned a cluster of genes involved in polysaccharide biosynthesis (epa) from Enterococcus faecalis strain OG1RF and showed that this gene cluster mediated synthesis of a polysaccharide in Escherichia coli. Disruption of two open reading frames in the epa gene cluster of OG1RF generated two mutants, TX5179 and TX5180, which were attenuated in a mouse peritonitis model. In the current study, Western blotting was performed with serum from a patient with E. faecalis endocarditis and polysaccharide extracts from OG1RF and the mutants TX5179 and TX5180. OG1RF showed a smear in the high-molecular-weight region and discrete bands in the low-molecular-weight region, which were missing from the mutants; periodate treatment and carbohydrate staining confirmed the polysaccharide nature of this material. In a neutrophil killing assay using OG1RF-absorbed normal human serum, the mutants TX5179 and TX5180, respectively, were 50 and 2.4 times more susceptible to killing than wild-type OG1RF (P < or = 0.01). With a fluorescence phagocytosis assay, 2.5 to 3 times more of the mutants were taken up by neutrophils than OG1RF (P < or = 0.001). Finally, with restriction digestion and hybridization under high-stringency conditions, the epa gene cluster of OG1RF (which is also present in the sequenced E. faecalis strain V583) was detected in 12 of 12 other clonally distinct E. faecalis strains tested: a similar polysaccharide pattern was detected for the 12 strains on Western blots using an E. faecalis endocarditis patient serum, and sera from four other patients with E. faecalis endocarditis all reacted with polysaccharide extracts of OG1RF. These results indicate that the epa gene cluster is widespread among E. faecalis and confers some protection against human host defenses.
TI  - THF carbapenems. Wyeth Ayerst.
AB  - CL-191121 is one of three new tetrahydrofuranyl (THF) carbapenems, which possess  stability to renal dihydropeptidase and beta-lactamases [162484], [387167], [418244] and have minimal binding to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) [163188]. Of the series of THF carbapenems, CL-191121 had the best activity against gram-positive organisms, particularly against Enterococcus faecalis. It demonstrated moderate oral activity against an Escherichia coli infection in mice and was 20-fold more efficacious than imipenem [253186]. As the effective oral dose (ED50) was 11- to 14-fold higher than the effective subcutaneous dose, a series of bis-double ester prodrugs (of the aminomethyl-THF 1beta-methyl-carbapenems) was prepared, which showed substantially improved oral bioavailability in the mouse model (EU50 = 0.42 microg/ml following a single oral dose obtained for the most potent compound) [258726]. OCA-983 is a prodrug derivative of CL-191121 sharing potent inhibitory activity against class A and class C beta-lactamases [324244], although development of this compound is no longer being pursued.
TI  - Construction of an integration-proficient vector based on the site-specific recombination mechanism of enterococcal temperate phage phiFC1.
AB  - The genome of temperate phage phiFC1 integrates into the chromosome of Enterococcus faecalis KBL 703 via site-specific recombination. In this study, an integration vector containing the attP site and putative integrase gene mj1 of phage phiFC1 was constructed. A 2,744-bp fragment which included the attP site and mj1 was inserted into a pUC19 derivative containing the cat gene to construct pEMJ1-1. E. faecalis KBL 707, which does not contain the bacteriophage but which has a putative attB site within its genome, could be transformed by pEMJ1-1. Southern hybridization, PCR amplification, and DNA sequencing revealed that pEMJ1-1 was integrated specifically at the putative attB site within the E. faecalis KBL 707 chromosome. This observation suggested that the 2,744-bp fragment carrying mj1 and the attP site of phage phiFC1 was sufficient for site-specific recombination and that pEMJ1-1 could be used as a site-specific integration vector. The transformation efficiency of pEMJ1-1 was as high as 6 x 10(3) transformants/microg of DNA. In addition, a vector (pATTB1) containing the 290-bp attB region was constructed. pATTB1 was transformed into Escherichia coli containing a derivative of the pET14b vector carrying attP and mj1. This resulted in the formation of chimeric plasmids by site-specific recombination between the cloned attB and attP sequences. The results indicate that the integration vector system based on the site-specific recombination mechanism of phage phiFC1 can be used for genetic engineering in E. faecalis and in other hosts.
TI  - Bacterial indices of drinking water from natural sources.
AB  - Two hundred forty samples of water from twenty natural sources were subjected to  the study for the detection of four bacterial indicators of faecal pollution. The samples were subjected to the detection of coliform, faecal coliform, E. coli, S. faecalis, Cl. welchii and plate count at 37 degrees C and 22 degrees C. All these samples were found unfit for human consumption. MPN for coliforms, E. coli and S. faecalis varied from 3 to 1800 per 100 ml of water, sero to 1800 per 100 ml water and zero to 540 per 100 ml of water respectively. Plate count at 37 degrees C and 22 degrees C varied from 2.5 x 10(3) to > 150 x 10(3) per ml of water. Cl. welchii was detected in 30.4% samples in rainy season and high plate count at 37 degrees C and 22 degrees C was observed during the same period.
TI  - Rapid antimicrobial susceptibility testing of urinary tract isolates and samples  by flow cytometry.
AB  - A multiparametric flow cytometry antimicrobial susceptibility test was developed  and its performance was evaluated on clinical urine isolates and samples in comparison with standard methods. Alterations in cytoplasmic membrane integrity were monitored by propidium iodide, and the anionic probe bis-(1,3-dibutylbarbituric acid) trimethine oxonol (DiBAC4(3)) was used to measure changes in membrane potential. Microbial size and cellular content were analysed by light scattering. Twelve antibiotics were tested on 6 ATCC control strains, 22 urine isolates and 19 clinical urine samples, variously containing Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, S. saprophyticus and S. epidermidis. Agreement between the flow cytometry results, broth microdilution and disk diffusion tests was 93.9% (n = 328 tests). Of the 20 discrepancies observed, 18 were for species other than E. coli. Perfect correlation was obtained with five antibiotics, whereas norfloxacin, nitrofurantoin and tetracycline were responsible for 13(65%) of the 20 discrepancies.
TI  - The bactericidal activity of gatifloxacin in plasma and urine.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the bactericidal activity of gatifloxacin in serum and  urine against relevant pathogens. METHODS: Serum and urine samples obtained in a single rising dose pharmacokinetic study were investigated for bactericidal activity. The doses employed were placebo, and 200, 400, 600 and 800 mg of gatifloxacin. RESULTS: The titers obtained reflected the dose and susceptibility of the pathogen. In serum a titer of greater-than-or-equal1:8 was observed for Escherichia coli for >24 h after 400 mg; for Staphylococcus aureus and Acinetobacter baumanii the titer was greater-than-or-equal1:8 for between 12--24 h after 600 mg; for Serratia marcescens it was greater-than-or-equal1:8 for >12 h following 800 mg; and for Streptococcus pneumoniae it was greater-than-or-equal1:8 for 8 h following 800 mg. In urine, the titers were greater, and for Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Proteus mirabilis and Enterococcus faecalis the titer was >1:8 for 12--24 h after 200 mg and for 24--36 h after a 400-mg dose. Pseudomonas aeruginosa demonstrated a titer of >1:8 for 18--24 h following 600 mg. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that gatifloxacin should be efficacious for a wide range of systemic and urinary tract infections.
TI  - Early bacterial and inflammatory responses to antibiotic therapy in a model of polymicrobial peritonitis in rats.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the consequences of different more or less selective treatments on the microbiological and inflammatory responses within the peritoneum. METHODS: The early effects of various antibiotic regimens were evaluated in a model of polymicrobial peritonitis with specifically prepared organisms. Six regimens (amoxycillin plus gentamicin, pefloxacin, ornidazole, pefloxacin plus ornidazole, imipenem and imipenem plus gentamicin) were evaluated at 24 h and 3 days in a non-fatal model of peritonitis in rats achieved by implantation of a capsule containing Escherichia coli, Bacteroides fragilis and Enterococcus faecalis. RESULTS: Therapies that disregarded several organisms were associated with persistence of the strains and an increased peritoneal inflammatory response within the peritoneum. In contrast, therapies active against Enterobacteriaceae and anaerobes were associated with decreases of all the inoculated organisms and a smaller inflammatory response. CONCLUSION: Therapies that disregarded the microorganisms implicated in peritoneal infection are associated with delayed bacterial eradication. The persistence of these organisms within the peritoneal fluid might be involved in prolonged peritoneal inflammation. Although it disregards enterococci, the standard therapy, represented by therapy against Enterobacteriaceae and anaerobes, demonstrates satisfactory effects towards all the inoculated organisms. This apparent contradiction could be related to mechanisms of bacterial synergy.
TI  - The migration of Proteus mirabilis and other urinary tract pathogens over Foley catheters.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the ability of organisms that infect the catheterized urinary tract to migrate over the surfaces of Foley catheters. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a simple laboratory model, organisms were challenged to migrate across sections of hydrogel-coated latex, hydrogel/silver-coated latex, silicone-coated latex and all-silicone catheters. The sections (1 cm long) were placed as bridges in channels between blocks of agar and the test organisms inoculated onto the agar adjacent to one side of each bridge. The plates were incubated at 37 degrees C for 24 h and examined for growth of the test organisms on the agar on the other side of the bridges. A collection of swarming, swimming and nonmotile species were tested in the model. The relative mobilities of the test organisms were expressed as migration indices, calculated as the percentage of tests in which bacterial migration was observed over each type of catheter bridge. RESULTS: The swarmer cells of Proteus mirabilis and P. vulgaris migrated successfully (migration indices of 73-100) over all four types of catheter. The migration index of Serratia marcescens swarmers was reduced to 33 over the silver-coated catheters, but these cells crossed over the other catheter surfaces with ease (indices of 100). Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most mobile of the swimming, non-swarming organisms with indices of 70-22, but this group was less capable of migration than the swarmers. Indices were 0-33 for nonmotile organisms. The mean migration indices for the nine species for each type of catheter were 57 (hydrogel-coated latex), 49 (silver/hydrogel-coated latex), 41 (silicone-coated latex) and 35 (all-silicone). The swarmer cells of P. mirabilis moved through populations of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis, and then migrated over sections of hydrogel-coated latex catheters with little or no reduction in migration index. They were also capable of transporting the nonmotile cells of K. pneumoniae and S. aureus over the catheters. The migration index of P. mirabilis swarmers was substantially reduced in the presence of Ps. aeruginosa and S. marcescens. CONCLUSIONS: Hydrogel coatings facilitate the migration of urinary tract pathogens over catheter surfaces. With the exception of S. marcescens, the incorporation of silver into the hydrogel did not inhibit migration. Swarmer cells were particularly effective at moving over catheters and P. mirabilis swarmers were also capable of transporting other species. This suggests that inhibitors of swarming could be useful in controlling catheter-associated infection and the complications resulting from the spread of bacterial biofilm over catheters.
TI  - In vitro antagonistic effect of Lactobacillus on organisms associated with bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess antagonistic properties of Lactobacillus strains isolated from the vaginas of healthy women as compared to the most common bacterial agents related to vaginosis. STUDY DESIGN: Antagonistic activity of different Lactobacillus strains isolated from the vaginas of healthy women not treated for infections with an antibiotic for the previous three months was screened using an agar slab method. The activity was tested against test organisms associated with bacterial vaginosis and/or urinary tract infections: Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Gardnerella vaginalis, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Prevotella bivia. RESULTS: Many of the 146 Lactobacillus strains tested exerted apparent antagonistic activities against gram-positive aerobic cocci and gram-negative rods, such as S aureus and E coli, and a marked number of Lactobacillus strains inhibited facultative bacteria, such as Gardnerella vaginalis and the anaerobes P anaerobius and P bivia. Only a few lactobacilli were able to inhibit growth of E faecalis and S agalactiae. Indicator bacteria growth inhibition probably relies upon several different complementary mechanisms. The specific indicator bacteria species determines which mechanism predominates. CONCLUSION: Lactobacillus strains taken from normal vaginal flora demonstrated antagonistic activity against a variety of bacteria related to vaginal and urinary tract infections. The specific occurrence rates of active Lactobacillus strains are different, and this difference is dependent on the indicator bacteria species.
TI  - [Urinary tract infection].
AB  
TI  - CASP2 knowledge-based approach to distant homology recognition and fold prediction in CASP4.
AB  - In 1996, in CASP2, we presented a semimanual approach to the prediction of protein structure that was aimed at the recognition of probable distant homology, where it existed, between a given target protein and a protein of known structure (Murzin and Bateman, Proteins 1997; Suppl 1:105-112). Central to our method was the knowledge of all known structural and probable evolutionary relationships among proteins of known structure classified in the SCOP database (Murzin et al., J Mol Biol 1995;247:536-540). It was demonstrated that a knowledge-based approach could compete successfully with the best computational methods of the time in the correct recognition of the target protein fold. Four years later, in CASP4, we have applied essentially the same knowledge-based approach to distant homology recognition, concentrating our effort on the improvement of the completeness and alignment accuracy of our models. The manifold increase of available sequence and structure data was to our advantage, as well as was the experience and expertise obtained through the classification of these data. In particular, we were able to model most of our predictions from several distantly related structures rather than from a single parent structure, and we could use more superfamily characteristic features for the refinement of our alignments. Our predictions for each of the attempted distant homology recognition targets ranked among the few top predictions for each of these targets, with the predictions for the hypothetical protein HI0065 (T0104) and the C-terminal domain of the ABC transporter MalK (T0121C) being particularly successful. We also have attempted the prediction of protein folds of some of the targets tentatively assigned to new superfamilies. The average quality of our fold predictions was far less than the quality of our distant homology recognition models, but for the two targets, chorismate lyase (T0086) and Appr>p cyclic phosphodiesterase (T0094), our predictions achieved the top ranking.
TI  - [Alive microorganism in the workplace ambient air in plants disposing communal waste].
AB  - This paper presents the results of the identification and determination of alive  microorganisms in the air samples collected from the breath zone of workers employed in the waste collection and disposal. Samples were taken during waste collection and in the waste reloading, sorting and composting plants. In addition, samples were taken at stationary sites: in the city and inside flats. Different kinds of species of Gram-positive bacteria (Micrococcus, Staphylococcus, Enterococcus, Bacillus, Listeria, Corynebacterium, Rhodococcus) and Gram-negative rods (Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas and other aerobic bacteria) were found. On every work site, there were fecal bacteria (Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium). The city areas and flats were free from this kind of bacteria. The number of mesophilic bacteria and thread-like fungi exceeding 10(4) cfu/m3 of air was counted on every work site. The largest number of mesophilic bacteria and Actinomycetes were found in the waste composting plant (10(4)-10(6) and 10(3)-10(5) cfu/m3, respectively), whereas the majority of fungal spores were counted during waste collection and sorting. (10(4)-10(5) cfu/m3). On the city streets there were no Actinomycetes and the number of fungal spores (10(4)/m3 of air) was similar to that observed in the waste reloading and composting plants. The amount of mesophilic bacteria in the city and flat samples was below 10(2)-10(3) cfu/m3. As to the number of fungal spores and Actinomycetes there was a limit of determination (10(1)-10(2) cfu/m3). The majority of mesopholic bacteria identified in the air were classified as the second group of occupational risk in the Council Directive 54/2000/EU. Bearing in mind that Gram-negative rods (especially intestinal) were identified in all samples, it is suggested to use endotoxin concentration as one of possible criteria for assessing the hygiene conditions at workplaces.
TI  - Spectrum of CT findings in nosocomial Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate CT findings in nosocomial Pseudomonas aeruginosa Pneumonia (PAP) and to compare features of PAP in patients with isolated P. aeruginosa cultures and those with coexistent infections. A retrospective database search revealed 28 patients with nosocomial PAP (12 men, 16 women; mean age, 57 years) in which thoracic CT had been performed within a mean of 1.7 days from the time of respiratory culture. Two chest radiologists blinded to culture data performed a consensus reading noting distribution and pattern of consolidation, ground-glass opacity, nodules, peribronchial infiltration, necrosis, effusions, and pleural enhancement. Coexistent respiratory cultures were recorded. Consolidation was present in all patients, involving multiple lobes in 23 (82%) and demonstrating upper zonal involvement in 23 (82%). Nodular features were present in 14 (50%), including tree-in-bud patterns with centrilobular distributions in 9 (64%) and larger, randomly distributed nodules in 5 (36%). Five of five patients with consolidations limited to the lower lung zones had associated upper lung nodules. Ground-glass opacity was seen in nine (31%) and peribronchial infiltration in 16 (57%). Necrosis was present in eight (29%). Thirteen (46%) bilateral and five (18%) unilateral pleural effusions were present with enhancement occurring in two (1%). Coexistent positive respiratory cultures were identified in 13 patients. The distribution of consolidation, frequency and distribution of nodules, and frequency of necrosis did not differ significantly between patients with and without other positive cultures. With CT, PAP most commonly presents with multifocal airspace consolidation. Nodular features were identified in half, with one-third demonstrating tree-in-bud opacities. Unsuspected necrosis occurred in one-third of cases. CT findings in patients with and without other respiratory isolates did not differ in the distribution and frequency of consolidations, nodularity, or necrosis.
TI  - Typing and subtyping of 83 clinical isolates purified from surgically implanted silicone feeding tubes by random amplified polymorphic DNA amplification.
AB  - In this study, 83 clinical isolates purified from biofilms colonizing 18 silicone gastrostomy devices (12 "buttons" and six tubes converted to skin level devices) were selected for subtype characterization utilizing genetic analysis. The tubes, previously used for feeding, remained in place for 3 to 47 months (mean, 20.0 months) in children ranging in age from 6 months to 17 years. Classification of specific microbes using random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis revealed genetic similarities and differences among isolates belonging to the same genus. Both gram-positive and -negative bacteria were investigated, including 2 isolates of Bacillus brevis, 4 isolates of Bacillus licheniformis, 2 isolates of Bacillus pumilus, 3 isolates of Enterococcus durans, 19 isolates of Enterococcus faecalis, 8 isolates of Enterococcus faecium, 2 isolates of Enterococcus hirae, 7 isolates of Escherichia coli, 8 isolates of Lactobacillus plantarum, 19 isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, 2 isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis, and 7 isolates of Staphylococcus saprophyticus. Amplified DNA fragments (amplicons) provided species-specific fingerprints for comparison by agarose gel electrophoresis. A total of 62 distinct RAPD types were categorized from the five genera studied. Typing analysis suggested cross acquisition of E. coli, E. faecalis, and S. aureus in three patient pairs. Genomic polymorphism detection proved efficient and reliable for classifying bacterial subtypes isolated from biofilms adhering to various portions of commonly employed enteral access tubes.
TI  - ccfA, the genetic determinant for the cCF10 peptide pheromone in Enterococcus faecalis OG1RF.
AB  - The nosocomial pathogen Enterococcus faecalis has a unique pheromone-inducible conjugative mating system. Conjugative transfer of the E. faecalis plasmid pCF10 is specifically induced by the cCF10 peptide pheromone (LVTLVFV). Genomic sequence information has recently allowed the identification of putative structural genes coding for the various enterococcal pheromones (D. B. Clewell et al., Mol. Microbiol. 35:246-247, 2000). The cCF10 pheromone sequence LVTLVFV was found within an open reading frame designated ccfA, encoding a putative lipoprotein precursor. Several other pheromone sequences were found in similar locations within other predicted lipoproteins. CcfA shows significant sequence relatedness to the Escherichia coli protein YidC, an inner membrane protein translocase, as well as to a large number of homologs identified in gram-positive and in gram-negative bacteria. Analysis of the deduced CcfA amino acid sequence suggested that mature cCF10 peptide could be formed from the proteolytic degradation of its signal peptide. Expression of the cloned ccfA gene with an inducible expression vector dramatically increased cCF10 production by E. faecalis and also resulted in cCF10 production by Lactococcus lactis, a non-pheromone producer. Site-directed mutagenesis of the ccfA sequence encoding the cCF10 peptide confirmed that ccfA was a functional genetic determinant for cCF10.
TI  - Microbial killing activity of peracetic acid.
AB  - In vitro killing activity of peracetic acid (Perasafe) at a concentration of 0.26 per cent w/v was tested against Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Salmonella paratyphi A, Acinetobacter baumannii, Sternotrophomonas maltophilia, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Bacillus subtilis spore, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and human immuno-deficiency virus type I. Exposure to Peracetic acid (0.26% w/v) for 10 minutes resulted in massive killing of all the aforementioned organisms and spore.
TI  - Assessment of BMS284756 MIC and 5-microg disk diffusion quality control studies tested against seven American type culture collection strains.
AB  - BMS284756 is a novel des-fluoro(6)-quinolone with antimicrobial activity similar  to recently developed fluorinated quinolones. The purpose of this investigation was to determine the appropriate disk diffusion and MIC quality control (QC) ranges for BMS284756 when used against commonly tested QC strains (M23-A2). The BMS284756 5-microg disk content was tested against Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Hemophilus influenzae ATCC 49247, Streptococcus pneumoniae ATCC 49619 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923. In addition, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212 and S. aureus ATCC 29213 were evaluated by the broth microdilution method. Seven laboratories tested 2 disk lots on 3 agar media or 3-4 broth lots over a 10 day period. A total of 420 zone diameter values and 210 or 280 MIC values per organism were generated. The following disk diffusion and MIC QC ranges were suggested for BMS284756 and the seven QC strains: E. coli ATCC 25922 (28-35 mm/0.004-0.016 microg/mL), E. faecalis ATCC 29212 (0.03-0.25 microg/mL), S. aureus ATCC 25923 (30-36 mm), S. aureus ATCC 29213 (0.004-0.016 microg/mL), P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 (19-25 mm/0.5-2 microg/mL), H. influenzae ATCC 49247 (33-41 mm/0.002-0.008 microg/mL), S. pneumoniae ATCC (26-33 mm/0.016-0.06 microg/mL). The proportion of participant results observed within the proposed ranges was 97.4-98.8% and 94.6-100% for the disk diffusion and MIC tests, respectively.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of the antimicrobial activity of a castor oil-based irrigant.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of irrigating solutions--Endoquil (castor oil detergent), 2% chlorhexidine gluconate solution, and 0.5% NaOCl solution-was evaluated against gram-positive cocci (Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus mutans, and Streptococcus sobrinus), gram-negative rods (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa), and the yeast Candida albicans. Activity was evaluated using the two-layer agar diffusion technique. The base layer was obtained by pouring 10.0 ml of Muller Hinton Medium or 10.0 ml of Brain Heart Infusion agar in a Petri dish. After solidification a 5.0 ml seed layer of Muller Hinton Medium or Brain Heart Infusion agar with inoculum (106/ml) was added. Absorbent paper disks (6.0 mm in diameter) immersed in the solutions were placed at equidistant points. Plates were maintained at room temperature for 2 h for prediffusion of the solutions and incubated at 37 degrees C for 24 h. The candle jar system was used for the Brain Heart Infusion agar plates. All tests were performed in duplicate. After incubation the medium was optimized with 0.05 g% triphenyltetrazolium chlorate gel and inhibition halos were measured. All bacterial strains were inhibited by 2.0% chlorhexidine gluconate. Endoquil was effective against gram-positive microorganisms, and 0.5% NaOCl was effective only against S. aureus.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents. Special references to bacteria isolated between April 1998 and March 1999].
AB  - The annual multicenter studies on isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery and their antimicrobial susceptibility have been conducted in Japan since July 1982. This paper describes the results obtained in fiscal 1998 (from April 1998 to March 1999). The number of cases investigated as objectives was 225 for one year. A total of 429 strains (121 strains from primary infections and 308 strains from postoperative infections) were isolated from 183 cases (81.3% of total cases). In primary infections, the isolation rates of anaerobes and Escherichia coli were higher than in postoperative infections, while in postoperative infections, those of Gram-positive aerobes and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were higher than in primary infections. On the whole, among Gram-positive aerobes, the isolation rate of Enterococcus faecalis was the highest, followed by Staphylococcus aureus with high frequency in isolation from postoperative infections. Among Gram-positive anaerobes, Peptostreptococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp. were predominantly isolated. Among Gram-negative aerobes, E. coli, P. aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae were frequently isolated. Among Gram-negative anaerobes, Bacteroides fragilis group was the majority of isolates. In primary infections, the percentage of Gram-negative aerobes has gradually increased since fiscal 1995 or 1996 with these years as the turning point, while those of Gram-positive and Gram-negative anaerobes have gradually declined. In postoperative infections, the percentage of Gram-negative anaerobes has increased continuously since the mid-1980s. The percentage of MRSA among S. aureus rose to 89.7%, which was the highest level since the beginning of this study. The susceptibilities of B. fragilis, which did not show apparent changes, were recognized to have decreased against cephems in fiscal 1998. Among other bacteria in B. fragilis group, development of resistance to cephems has continued on a long-term basis since the mid-1980s. E. coli and K. pneuminiae have obviously not changed in susceptibilities, however, the susceptibilities of isolated strains in fiscal 1998 against high-generation cephems, oxacephems and monobactams have declined. We found neither vancomycin-resistant nor teicoplanin-resistant strains of S. aureus and Enterococcus spp.
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial activity of new diazoimidazole derivatives containing an N-acylpyrrolidine ring.
AB  - A series of 4-diazoimidazole-5-carboxamides bearing in position 2 lipophilic substituents was synthesized and their antimicrobial activity was evaluated in vitro against pathogenic Gram-positive, Gram-negative bacteria and fungi. Some compounds presented antifungal activity, particularly two derivatives (1g and 1h) showed good MIC values (10-50 microg/ml) against both moulds and yeasts.

AB  - A "plasmid-curing effect" of multiresistant Escherichia coli by flavophospholipol, an antibiotic used as an antimicrobial growth promoter (AMGP) in animal feeds, has been reported to occur in vitro and in vivo under experimental conditions. In this study, the effect of flavophospholipol under field conditions was studied. The prevalence and degree (proportion of resistant strains to the total numbers present per gram of feces) of resistance of indicator bacteria, E. coli and enterococci, was determined in fecal samples from three groups of pigs that were fed a commercial finisher feed without any AMGP. Group A was the negative control group without any AMGP, group B received the same feed with 9 mg of flavophospholipol/kg of feed (study group), and group C received the same feed with 15 mg of avoparcin/kg (positive control). Fecal samples from each pig were collected at the start and at the end of the study and assessed for the prevalence and degree of resistance against antibiotics commonly used either for therapy in pig medicine or as an AMGP. Before the start of the study, all pigs were colonized with multiresistant E. coli by mixing three resistant pig isolates through their feed after disturbance of the colonization resistance of the intestinal flora by a 3-day course of lincomycin and spectinomycin. At the end of the study, the overall prevalence and degree of resistance of E. coli in the fecal flora had increased significantly in groups A and C but remained at the same level as at the start of the study in group B. The prevalence of vancomycin resistance was 44 and 41% in groups A and B, respectively, but only very low numbers of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) per gram of feces were found. In the avoparcin-fed group, the prevalence was 72%, and in 57% of the samples, more than 50% of all enterococci present were vancomycin resistant. The prevalence of resistant Enterococcus faecalis increased only in the flavophospholipol-exposed group, from 23% before the start of the study to 43% at the end of the study. It was concluded that flavophospholipol effectively suppressed the augmentation and dissemination of multiresistant E. coli in the intestinal flora of fattening pigs. Avoparcin use strongly selected for VRE carriage and excretion. Therefore, as neither flavophospholipol nor any related molecule is used therapeutically, no cross-resistance with therapeutic antibiotics exists and no transmissible resistance has been shown; the major decrease in resistance in intestinal E. coli of flavophospholipol-fed animals seemed to outweigh the small increase in the risk of transfer of flavophospholipol-resistant E. faecalis from animals to humans via the food chain.
TI  - Drosophila MyD88 is required for the response to fungal and Gram-positive bacterial infections.
AB  - We report here the identification and functional characterization of DmMyD88, a gene encoding the Drosophila homolog of mammalian MyD88. DmMyD88 combines a Toll-IL-1R homology (TIR) domain and a death domain. Overexpression of DmMyD88 was sufficient to induce expression of the antifungal peptide Drosomycin, and induction of Drosomycin was markedly reduced in DmMyD88-mutant flies. DmMyD88 interacted with Toll through its TIR domain and required the death domain proteins Tube and Pelle to activate expression of Drs, which encodes Drosomycin. DmMyD88-mutant flies were highly susceptible to infection by fungi and Gram-positive bacteria, but resisted Gram-negative bacterial infection much as did wild-type flies. Phenotypic comparison of DmMyD88-mutant flies and MyD88-deficient mice showed essential differences in the control of Gram-negative infection in insects and mammals.
TI  - Pre-inoculation of urinary catheters with Escherichia coli 83972 inhibits catheter colonization by Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - PURPOSE: The capacity of a preexisting coating of Escherichia coli 83972 to reduce catheter colonization by Enterococcus faecalis 210 was investigated. Enterococcus was chosen for these trials since it is a common urinary pathogen in patients with an indwelling urinary catheter. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Each experiment tested 3 growth conditions. Group 1 or E. coli plus Enterococcus catheters were exposed to E. coli 83972 for 24 hours and then to Enterococcus for 30 minutes. Group 2 or E. coli alone catheters were incubated in E. coli for 24 hours and then in sterile broth for 30 minutes. Group 3 or Enterococcus alone catheters did not undergo the initial incubation with E. coli before the 30-minute incubation with Enterococcus: All catheters were then incubated in sterile human urine for 24 hours. Catheters were washed with saline and cut into 5, 1 cm. segments. Each segment was sonicated and the sonication fluid was diluted and plated. The results of each of the 5 segments were averaged and the set of experiments was repeated 7 times. RESULTS: A preexisting coating of E. coli 83972 reduced catheter colonization by E. faecalis 210 more than 10-fold. Enterococcus alone catheters had a median of 9.7 x 10(5) enterococci per cm., whereas E. coli plus Enterococcus catheters had a median of 0.38 x 10(5) enterococci per cm. (p = 0.016). CONCLUSIONS: Pre-inoculating urinary catheters with E. coli 83972 significantly impedes catheter colonization by Enterococcus: These promising in vitro results prompt the clinical investigation of this particular application of bacterial interference.
TI  - Grazing rates of diverse morphotypes of bacterivorous ciliates feeding on four allochthonous bacteria.
AB  - AIMS: The permanence in aquatic systems of allochthonous bacteria coming from sewage effluents is a risk for public health. This work aimed to analyse the elimination of the bacteria Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae by a riverine ciliate community. METHODS AND RESULTS: The ciliates were characterized and identified on the basis of morphological and behavioural features and grouped in nine morphotypes. Differential grazing by each morphotype on the four allochthonous bacteria was carried out by adding fluorescently labelled bacteria to the water samples, and measuring their uptake along time. CONCLUSIONS: The nine morphotypes were present in all the samples but in different proportions, being the most abundant the small scuticociliates and hipotrichs. The smallest morphotypes showed grazing rates lower than 20 FLB ciliate(-1) h(-1), with a preference towards K. pneumoniae. The larger morphotypes showed in general the highest grazing rates, but the selectivity was hardly attributable to bacterial size or type of cell wall. CONCLUSIONS, SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The elimination of allochthonous bacteria in an aquatic system may be highly different depending on the diversity of the ciliated protistan community in the system and on the nature of the bacterial prey.
TI  - Infectious complications and antibiotic use in renal transplant recipients during a 1-year follow-up.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate infectious complications and antibiotic use in 192 renal transplant recipients. METHODS: Infectious complications and antibiotic use were monitored in all patients receiving renal transplantation at our center from 1992 to 1997. Risk factors for infectious complications were evaluated. Transplants and patient survival were monitored. The follow-up period was 1 year. RESULTS: One-hundred and ninety-two patients received renal transplants during the study period. The mean duration of urethral catheterisation after transplantation was 10.5 days (SD = 5). Seventy-one per cent (n = 137) of patients had at least one infectious episode. In all, 284 infectious episodes were monitored. The most frequent infections were: urinary tract infections 61%, respiratory tract infections 8%, intra-abdominal infections 7%, and cytomegalovirus infection 8%. Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis were the most frequently isolated microorganisms. Seventy-four per cent (n = 142) of patients received 314 antimicrobial courses (284 for therapy, and 30 for prophylaxis). Female gender and duration of urethral catheterisation were risk factors for urinary tract infection. Cytomegalovirus reactivation was associated with acute graft rejection and additional immunosuppressive therapy. Overall mortality was 4%. Infection-related mortality was 2.6%. Mortality was associated with Enterobacteriaceae in three patients, with Pseudomonas aeroginosa in one patient and with Enterococcus faecalis in one patient. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of infectious complications remains high in renal transplant recipients. Most cases of mortality were associated with infections. Early removal of the urethral catheter to reduce the risk of urinary tract infections is recommended.
TI  - Frequency of isolation and antimicrobial resistance of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria from patients in intensive care units of 25 European university hospitals participating in the European arm of the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program 1997-1998.
AB  - A total of 3,981 isolates from patients treated at intensive care units were collected in 25 European university hospitals during 1997 and 1998 as part of the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program. Overall, the most important species isolated were Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), Enterobacter spp., Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Enterococcus faecalis. Thirty-nine percent of all Staphylococcus aureus isolates were resistant to oxacillin. All Staphylococcus aureus isolates were fully susceptible to linezolid and vancomycin. Moreover, all CNS isolates were susceptible to vancomycin and minocycline. All Enterococcus faecalis isolates were susceptible to vancomycin, and 99% of these isolates were also susceptible to ampicillin. The antimicrobial agents most effective against Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were amikacin, piperacillin/tazobactam, meropenem, and cefepime, with 87, 85, 84, and 83% of isolates being susceptible, respectively. Escherichia coli isolates were fully susceptible to carbapenems, and at least 99% of these isolates were susceptible to ceftriaxone, cefepime, and amikacin. The Enterobacter spp. were also highly susceptible to carbapenems, amikacin, and cefepime, with 99, 97, and 96% of isolates being susceptible, respectively. Haemophilus influenzae was susceptible to most of the antibiotics tested. Only 68% of the pneumococcal isolates were fully susceptible to penicillin, yet 100% were susceptible to a number of fluoroquinolones and vancomycin. There are still sufficient treatment options for patients infected with the most important bacterial species involved in infections in intensive care units. However, the situation for patients with Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections is critical.
TI  - Urinary excretion and bactericidal activities of gemifloxacin and ofloxacin after a single oral dose in healthy volunteers.
AB  - In a randomized crossover study, 16 volunteers (8 men, 8 women) received single oral doses of 320 mg of gemifloxacin and 400 mg of ofloxacin on two separate occasions in the fasting state to assess the urinary excretion and urinary bactericidal titers (UBTs) at intervals for up to 144 h. Ofloxacin showed higher concentrations in urine compared with those of gemifloxacin. The median (range) cumulative excretion of gemifloxacin was 29.7% (8.4 to 48.7%) of the parent drug administered, and median (range) cumulative excretion of ofloxacin was 84.3% (46.5 to 95.2%) of the parent drug administered. The UBTs, i.e., the highest twofold dilutions (with antibiotic-free urine as the diluent) of urine that were still bactericidal, were determined for a reference strain and nine uropathogens for which the MICs of gemifloxacin and ofloxacin were as follows: Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, 0.016 and 0.06 microg/ml, respectively; Klebsiella pneumoniae, 0.03 and 0.06 microg/ml, respectively; Proteus mirabilis, 0.125 and 0.125 microg/ml, respectively; Escherichia coli, 0.06 and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 1 and 4 microg/ml, respectively; Staphylococcus aureus, 0.008 and 0.25 microg/ml, respectively; Enterococcus faecalis, 0.06 and 2 microg/ml, respectively; Staphylococcus aureus, 0.25 and 4 microg/ml, respectively; Enterococcus faecalis, 0.5 and 32 microg/ml, respectively; and Staphylococcus aureus, 2 and 32 microg/ml, respectively. Generally, the UBTs for gram-positive uropathogens were higher for gemifloxacin than for ofloxacin and the UBTs for gram-negative uropathogens were higher for ofloxacin than for gemifloxacin. According to the UBTs, ofloxacin-resistant uropathogens (MICs, >or=4 mg/liter) should also be considered gemifloxacin resistant. Although clinical trials have shown that gemifloxacin is effective for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections, whether an oral dosage of 320 mg of gemifloxacin once daily is also adequate for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections has yet to be confirmed.
TI  - Antibiotic susceptibility of bacterial strains isolated from patients with community-acquired urinary tract infections.
AB  - Isolates from urine samples obtained during 1999 were identified and their susceptibility to antimicrobial agents studied along with any production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) by Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. A total of 13774 samples were analysed using an automatic system for the detection of bacterial ATP (Coral, USA). Of these samples, 49% were reported to be positive and uncontaminated; bacteria most frequently isolated were E. coli (47%), Proteus mirabilis (7%), Enterococcus faecalis (6%) and K. pneumoniae (5%). The susceptibility studies showed 37% E. coli strains resistant to amoxycillin+clavulanate 33% to cotrimoxazole and 22% to ciprofloxacin. Seven strains of E. coli produced ESBL. Thirteen per cent of strains were resistant to cefuroxime but only (1%) to fosfomycin. Resistance to nitrofurantoin in K. pneumoniae was 38%. P. mirabilis showed 52% resistance to cotrimoxazole and 13% Staphylococcus aureus, were methicillin-resistant. E. faecalis did not show any special resistance to normal medication. Fosfomycin continued to show high activity against Gram-negative bacilli. However, enterococci, some species of staphylococci and yeasts were difficult to treat empirically. ESBL were detected in the isolates of E. coli and there were some methicillin-resistant strains of S. aureus.
TI  - In vitro activity of moxifloxacin against common clinical bacterial isolates in Taiwan.
AB  - The in vitro antimicrobial activities of moxifloxacin were compared with 7 other  antimicrobial agents. A total of 707 isolates of 11 common pathogenic bacteria were collected from the National Taiwan University Hospital; antimicrobial activities against these isolates were evaluated by minimum inhibitory concentration using an agar-dilution method. Most common pathogenic bacteria were susceptible to moxifloxacin, including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cepacia, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. For many of these bacterial species, moxifloxacin was the most active antimicrobial agent compared with the third- and fourth- generation cephalosporins, carbapenems, monobactam, and other quinolones. Some strains of methicillin-resistant S. aureus and methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis demonstrated very low levels of minimum inhibitory concentration for moxifloxacin, suggesting the potential application of the drug to treat some drug-resistant gram-positive bacterial infections. Moxifloxacin was less active against P. aeruginosa, but was more active against S. maltophilia when compared with other fluoroquinolones. In conclusion, moxifloxacin exhibits an increased potency against gram-positive bacteria as compared with other tested antimicrobial agents, while preserving excellent activity against gram-negative bacteria. The drug appears to be a promising agent expressing activity against a wide variety of bacteria in Taiwan.
TI  - Herpes simplex virus type 2 modulates the susceptibility of human bladder cells to uropathogenic bacteria.
AB  - The present study analyses the susceptibility of human bladder-derived cells (HT-1376) to the infection by herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) and Chlamydia trachomatis, as well as to the adhesiveness of uropathogenic bacteria. HT-1376 cells were efficiently infected by HSV-2 strain 333, as demonstrated by immunofluorescence staining of viral antigens, titration of cytopathic effect, and visualisation by transmission electron microscopy. This cell model was also prone to C. trachomatis (serovar E, Bour strain) replication and to the adherence of clinical uropathogenic isolates of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus vulgaris and Enterococcus faecalis. The pre-infection of HT-1376 cells with HSV-2 caused a tenfold increased adherence of an E. coli strain (U1), isolated from a patient affected by severe haemorrhagic cystitis, whereas in HSV-2 pre-infected cells the number of C. trachomatis inclusion bodies was significantly reduced. Our findings indicate that these cells are a suitable in vitro model for studying infection and super-infection of the lower urinary tract by viruses and bacteria.
TI  - [Utility of prolonged incubation and terminal subcultures of blood cultures from  immunocompromised patients].
AB  - The value of blind terminal subcultures (7 and 30 days) and prolonged incubation  (30 days) of blood cultures from immunosuppressed patients was analyzed in the Fundacion Favaloro, the Fundacion para la Lucha contra las Enfermedades Neurologicas de la Infancia and the Hospital de Ninos Ricardo Gutierrez. A total of 2707 blood cultures and 369 patients were included (transplantation of solid organs 154, oncohematologic disorders 106 and solid tumors 109). Bact-Alert bottles were incubated at 35 degrees C for 30 days in the Bact-Alert System. Bottles with positive signals were routinely removed, and aliquots of the broth were Gram stained and subcultured aerobically in chocolate agar and Sabouraud agar. A total of 136 bacteremic episodes were obtained. The positivization time of blood cultures was 81.6% at 24 h, 93.3% at 48 h, 94.5% at 72 h and 97.7% within 7 days. Only 3 (2.2%) episodes were positive by blind terminal subcultures and 1 (0.75%) by prolonged incubation (14 days). The median time and range of positivization in hours were 13.8 and 2.2-168, respectively. The microorganisms isolated were coagulase negative staphylococci (n = 24), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 22), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 21), Escherichia coli (n = 18), Acinetobacter spp (n = 9), Candida spp (n = 8), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 6), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 5), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 5), Enterococcus faecalis, Salmonella spp and Capnocytophaga sputigena (n = 2), Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterococcus faecium, Citrobacter diversus, Candida albicans, Klebsiella oxytoca, Chryseomonas luteola, Serratia marcescens, Abiotrophia spp, Campylobacter jejuni, Moraxella catarrhalis, Moraxella urethralis, Neisseria sicca, beta hemolytic group G streptococci, Rhodococcus equi, Micrococcus spp, Cryptococcus neoformans and Streptococcus mitis (n = 1). In our experience, blind terminal subcultures and prolonged incubation of blood cultures from immunosuppressed patients are unnecessary and cost expensive.

TI  - Isolation of yeasts and enteric bacteria in root-filled teeth with chronic apical periodontitis.
AB  - AIMS: The aim of this study was to determine the occurrence and role of yeasts, enteric gram-negative rods and Enterococcus species in root-filled teeth with chronic apical periodontitis, and the antimicrobial effect of iodine potassium iodide (IKI) irrigation. METHODOLOGY: Forty symptom-free root-filled teeth with chronic apical periodontitis were included in the study. The patients were divided into two groups. In group A the canals were filled with calcium hydroxide for 10-14 days after cleaning and shaping; in group B the canals were irrigated with IKI for 5 min after cleaning and shaping followed by a permanent root filling. Microbiological samples were taken from the canals before and after the chemomechanical preparation and after iodine irrigation (group B). RESULTS: Microbes were isolated from 33 of 40 teeth in the initial sampling. Yeasts were isolated from six teeth, three of them together with E. faecalis. Enteric rods (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis) were present in three teeth and E. faecalis was isolated from 21 of the 33 culture positive teeth, 11 in pure culture. Growth was detected in 10 teeth of the second samples. Six of the 10 cases were E. faecalis, with five being a pure culture. All third samples (after IKI) except one were negative. The number of microbial cells per sample did not correlate with lesion size. Two flare-ups were recorded, both in teeth with a mixed infection. CONCLUSION: The high prevalence of enteric bacteria and yeasts in root-filled teeth with chronic apical periodontitis was established. IKI improved the antimicrobial effect of the treatment.
TI  - Comparison of the methylene blue and toluidine blue photobactericidal efficacy against gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Studies on the photobactericidal efficacy of methylene  blue (MB) and toluidine blue (TB) have shown inconsistent results in the literature. This study evaluated the bactericidal efficacy of MB and TB against different bacteria under light and dark conditions to determine the most effective bactericidal dye. STUDY DESIGN/MATERIALS AND METHODS: Suspensions of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Hemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in saline were treated in dark and red laser light conditions in the presence of each dye using an argon pumped-dye and a diode laser emitting light at 630 and 664 nm, respectively. The effect of dye concentration, dark incubation time, the fluence and intensity of laser light on the destruction of different bacteria were compared. RESULTS: Both dyes eradicated all examined bacteria under laser light. The complete photodestruction of microorganisms was reached at TB concentrations of 1.5-7-fold less than that of MB. CONCLUSION: TB exhibits a greater bactericidal activity than MB against most bacteria in dark and light conditions. Mostly, these results are consistent with their respective dye partition coefficients.
TI  - Trehalose-6-phosphate phosphorylase is part of a novel metabolic pathway for trehalose utilization in Lactococcus lactis.
AB  - Lactococcus lactis splits phosphorylated trehalose by the action of inorganic phosphate-dependent trehalose-6-phosphate phosphorylase (TrePP) in a novel catabolic pathway. TrePP was found to catalyze the reversible conversion of trehalose 6-phosphate into beta-glucose 1-phosphate and glucose 6-phosphate by measuring intermediate sugar phosphates in cell extracts from trehalose-cultivated lactococci. According to native PAGE and SDS-PAGE, TrePP was shown to be a monomeric enzyme with a molecular mass of 94 kDa. Reaction kinetics suggested that the enzyme follows a ternary complex mechanism with optimal phosphorolysis at 35 degrees C and pH 6.3. The equilibrium constants were found to be 0.026 and 0.032 at pH 6.3 and 7.0, respectively, favoring the formation of trehalose 6-phosphate. The Michaelis-Menten constants of TrePP for trehalose 6-phosphate, inorganic phosphate, beta-glucose 1-phosphate, and glucose 6-phosphate were determined to be 6, 32, 0.9, and 4 mm, respectively. The TrePP-encoding gene, designated trePP, was localized in a putative trehalose operon of L. lactis. This operon includes the gene encoding beta-phosphoglucomutase in addition to three open reading frames believed to encode a transcriptional regulator and two trehalose-specific phosphotransferase system components. The identity of trePP was confirmed by determining the N-terminal amino acid sequence of TrePP and by its overexpression in Escherichia coli and L. lactis, as well as the construction of a lactococcal trePP knockout mutant. Furthermore, both TrePP and beta-phosphoglucomutase activity were detected in Enterococcus faecalis cell extract, indicating that this bacterium exhibits the same trehalose assimilation route as L. lactis.
TI  - High-performance, low-cost solar collectors for disinfection of contaminated water.
AB  - Although the germicidal action of sunlight has long been recognized, its potential for practical applications has to be researched more thoroughly. This paper summarizes the progress made toward a commercially practical collector for solar disinfection applications. Nontracking compound parabolic collectors (CPCs), developed originally for capturing solar photons for thermal energy applications, were examined as potential solar photoreactors. A field demonstration of solar disinfection treatment using commercially manufactured solar reactors was conducted. Field tests showed successful destruction of Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis and have provided data for full-scale design of water treatment systems. From above observations, a throughput value of 50 L/m2 h for the low-cost CPC reactor tested was estimated. For a 190 m3/d (0.05 MGD) facility, the estimated total costs for disinfection using UV-A is U.S. $0.19/m3 ($0.70/1000 gal). The use of near-UV sunlight to disinfect water supplies seems promising in rural communities of developing countries where treated water is unavailable.
TI  - The penicillin resistance of Enterococcus faecalis JH2-2r results from an overproduction of the low-affinity penicillin-binding protein PBP4 and does not involve a psr-like gene.
AB  - A penicillin-resistant mutant, JH2-2r (MIC 75 microg ml(-1)), was isolated from Enterococcus faecalis JH2-2 (MIC 5 microg ml(-1)) by successive passages on plates containing increasing concentrations of benzylpenicillin. A comparison of the penicillin-binding protein (PBP) profiles in the two strains revealed a more intensely labelled PBP4 in JH2-2r. Because the sequences of the JH2-2 and JH2-2r pbp4 genes were strictly identical, even in their promoter regions, this intensive labelling could only be associated with an overproduction of the low-affinity PBP4. No psr gene analogous to that proposed to act as a regulator of PBP5 synthesis in Enterococcus hirae and Enterococcus faecium could be identified in the vicinity of pbp4 in E. faecalis JH2-2 and JH2-2r. However, a psr-like gene distant from pbp4 was identified. The cloning and sequencing of that psr-like gene from both E. faecalis strains indicated that they were identical. It is therefore postulated that the PBP4 overproduction in E. faecalis JH2-2r results from the modification of an as yet unidentified factor.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of traditional Australian medicinal plants.
AB  - Fifty-six ethanolic extracts of various parts of 39 plants used in traditional Australian Aboriginal medicine were investigated for their antibacterial activities against four Gram-positive (Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes) and four Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella typhimurium) bacterial species. In a plate-hole diffusion assay, 12 extracts inhibited the growth of one or more of the bacteria, with five extracts showing broad spectrum antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria. B. cereus was the most susceptible bacterium, with all 12 extracts displaying activity against this organism. Extracts from the leaves of Eremophila species (Myoporaceae) were the most active, with Eremophila duttonii exhibiting the greatest activity (against Gram-positive bacteria). The antibacterial effects of E. duttonii were further investigated by time-course growth assays which showed that significant growth inhibition was observed in cultures incubated in the presence of the extract within 1 h for B. cereus, E. faecalis and S. aureus and 2 h for S. pyogenes.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (1999). III. Secular changes in susceptibility].
AB  - The bacteria (Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) isolated from patients diagnosed as having urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 9 institutions in Japan were supplied between the period of August 1999 to July 2000. Then, the susceptibilities of these bacteria to various antimicrobial agents were examined and the results were compared with those obtained between 1991 and 1998. Comparison was made by classifying strains isolated from patients into those with uncomplicated UTIs and those with complicated UTIs (including with or without indwelling catheter). About E. faecalis, increase of low sensitive strains noted in the former year showed a decreasing tendency, however, one strain each with MIC of 4 micrograms/ml to vancomycin (VCM) was detected in patients with both uncomplicated and complicated UTIs. As for S. aureus, many sensitive strains to cephems, imipenem (IPM) and VCM were noted, and each MIC50 was better than that in the former years. S. aureus strains showing low susceptibility to arbekacin (ABK) were detected in patients with complicated UTIs in this year as well as in the former year, and one strain each with MIC of 16 micrograms/ml and 32 micrograms/ml was detected. Susceptibilities of E. coli were effective to all drugs except for penicillins and minocycline (MINO). Decrease of low sensitive strains was also noted in all drugs except for quinolones. Each MIC90 of ciprofloxacin (CPFX) and sparfloxacin (SPFX) in patients with complicated UTIs against E. coli was 3 degrees classes lower than that in patients with uncomplicated UTIs. As for Klebsiella pneumoniae, decrease of low sensitive strains to cephems was noted in patients with uncomplicated UTIs in 1998. In 1999, low sensitive strains decreased also in patients with complicated UTIs, and few were detected. Susceptibilities of K. pneumoniae to quinolones were effective as compared with those in the former years with the MIC80s of 0.125 microgram/ml or below without detection of low sensitive strains. One low sensitive strain of K. pneumoniae with MIC of 8 micrograms/ml was detected for gentamicin (GM). Susceptibilities of P. aeruginosa to carbapenems were notable. The MIC90 of meropenem (MEPM) and IPM was 4 micrograms/ml each which was 2 degrees better than that in 1998. Resistant P. aeruginosa strains to other drugs except for monobactams decreased in 1999.
TI  - Multi-resistance to antimicrobial agents for the ten most frequently isolated bacterial pathogens.
AB  - Cross-resistance and multi-resistance to selected antibiotics was determined for  Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis. Amikacin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae often showed cross-resistance to ss-lactam antibiotics. Only 1% of the Escherichia coli isolates showed resistance to more than four antibiotics from a set of seven. This rate was higher for other Enterobacteriaceae and there were high levels of cross-resistance for P. aeruginosa. The cross-resistance of oxacillin with other antibiotics is well known in staphylococci. Penicillin-resistant pneumococcal isolates were cross-resistant to macrolides. Cross-resistance was only a minor problem in H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis. Cross- and multi-resistance are important problems for Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria but not for fastidious bacteria with the exception of penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (1999). II. Background of patients].
AB  - Five-hundred forty four bacterial strains isolated from 412 patients diagnosed as having urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 9 institutions in Japan were supplied between the period of August 1999 to July 2000. Then, the clinical background of patients were investigated such as sex, age and type of infections, infections and kind of bacteria, frequency of isolation of bacteria by age and infections, bacteria and infections by timing of administration of antibiotics, and bacteria and infections by surgical procedures. About the relationship between age and sex of patients and type of infections, the number of male patients aged less than 50 years was few, and complicated UTIs without indwelling catheter was the most frequent. In females, the number of patients aged less than 20 years was few. Complicated UTIs without indwelling catheter was the most frequent among female patients aged between 40 to 59 years, in other age groups, uncomplicated UTIs was most frequent. As for type of infections and kind of bacteria, Escherichia coli decreased when the infections became complicated, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus faecalis increased when the infection became complicated. Considering this result by age of patients, isolation frequency of E. coli was gradually decreased with aging in patients aged more than 20 years with uncomplicated UTIs or complicated UTIs without indwelling catheter. The isolation frequencies of E. faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus were gradually increased with aging in complicated UTIs without indwelling catheter. In patients with complicated UTIs with indwelling catheter, there was no difference between age group, and P. aeruginosa and E. faecalis were frequently isolated. As for type of causative organisms in UTIs before and after the administration of antibiotics, the isolation of bacteria was remarkably decreased after administration in patients with uncomplicated UTIs and complicated UTIs without indwelling catheter. E. coli decreased after administration of antibiotics, and P. aeruginosa and E. faecalis increased after administration in patients with all infections. As for type of causative organisms in UTIs and surgical procedures, E. coli were more frequently isolated in patients with uncomplicated UTIs when surgical procedures were experienced. Also, Klebsiella spp. and E. faecalis were more frequently isolated in patients with surgical procedures. However, in complicated UTIs, type of causative organisms had no relationship with surgical procedures.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (1999). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The bacterial strains isolated from patients diagnosed as having urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 9 institutions in Japan were supplied between the period of August 1999 to July 2000. Then, the susceptibilities of them to many kinds of antimicrobial agents were investigated. The number of them were 499 strains. The breakdown of these strains was Gram-positive bacteria as 31.3% and Gram-negative bacteria as 68.7%. Susceptibilities of these bacteria to antimicrobial agents were as follows; vancomycin (VCM), ampicillin (ABPC) and imipenem (IPM) showed strong activities against Enterococcus faecalis. The increase of low-susceptible strains which was noticed in the former year showed a slight recovery in this year. VCM showed a strong activity against MRSA preventing growth of all strains with 1 microgram/ml. In addition, the activity of arbekacin (ABK) was also strong with the MIC90 of 2 micrograms/ml against MRSA. However, MSSA and MRSA showing low susceptibilities were detected in one strain each (MIC: 16 micrograms/ml and 32 micrograms/ml, respectively). Carbapenems showed high activities against Citrobacter freundii and Escherichia coli. Meropenem (MEPM) prevented growth of all strains within 0.125 microgram/ml. Quinolone resistant E. coli decreased in this year compared with those in the last year, that percentage was less than 5%. Almost all drugs showed strong activities against Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis. MEPM and carumonam (CRMN) prevented growth of all strains within 0.125 microgram/ml. On the other hand, one strain of K. pneumoniae showing resistance to cefaclor (CCL) and one strain of P. mirabilis showing low susceptibility to most of cephems were detected. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, almost drugs were not so active. The MIC90s of carbapenems were 8 micrograms/ml and those of all other drugs were more than 16 micrograms/ml.
TI  - Conserved DegP protease in gram-positive bacteria is essential for thermal and oxidative tolerance and full virulence in Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - The DegP protease, a multifunctional chaperone and protease, has been shown to be essential for virulence in gram-negative pathogens such as Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Brucella abortus, Yersinia enterocolitica, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The function of DegP in pathogenesis appears to be the degradation of damaged proteins that accumulate as a result of the initial host response to infection, which includes the release of reactive oxygen intermediates. Additionally, the DegP protease plays a major role in monitoring and maintaining the Escherichia coli periplasm and influences E. coli pilus biogenesis. We report here the identification of highly homologous enzymes in Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis. Moreover, the phenotype of an insertionally inactivated degP allele in S. pyogenes is similar to that reported for E. coli, with temperature sensitivity for growth and enhanced sensitivity to reactive oxygen intermediates. Virulence studies in a mouse model of streptococcal infection indicate that a functional DegP protease is required for full virulence. These results suggest DegP as an attractive broad-spectrum target for future anti-infective drug development.
TI  - [Profile of bacterial isolates and antimicrobial susceptibility: Multicenter study using a one-day cut-off].
AB  - The frequency and antimicrobial susceptibility of bacterial isolates from the largest clinical samples collected in 19 Spanish hospitals were studied. A total of 523 strains were identified and grouped by sample. Blood stream: Staphylococcus coagulase-negative (41%) and Escherichia coli (19.7%); oxacillin resistance occurred in 44% of coagulase-negative strains, strains which were also resistant to nonbetalactam agents. All antimicrobial agents tested had good activity against E. coli, with the exception of penicillins (25 to 33% susceptible). Urine: E. coli (59.1%) and Enterococcus faecalis (15%); aminoglycosides and third generation cephalosporins were the most active compounds against E. coli, whereas penicillins and cotrimoxazole were the least active. E. faecalis isolates showed low rates of resistance to the antibiotics tested and no glycopeptide-resistant strains were detected. Skin and soft tissues: Staphylococcus aureus (24.1%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (17.7.%); oxacillin resistance occurred in 15.8% of S. aureus strains and co-resistance to nonbetalactam agents was frequently observed among these strains. Ceftazidime susceptibility was elevated among P. aeruginosa (76.9%) and the most active agents were aminoglycosides (100% susceptibility). Lower respiratory tract: P. aeruginosa (21.4%) and Haemophilus influenzae (15.5%). Aminoglycosides (88.8 to 94.4%) and ceftazidime (72%) presented the highest susceptibility rates in P. aeruginosa. All the agents tested were very active against H. influenzae (89% susceptibility). Among Gram-positive cocci, no vancomycin and/or teicoplanin-resistant strains were detected.
TI  - [Evaluation of the bacterial flora in natural corn silage].
AB  - Silage is the best method for forage conservation, keeping it in a fresh condition and with high nutrient content. In order to study the natural evolution of maize silage without additives during 50 days after sealed, pH, temperature changes, number and type of the indigenous bacteria were studied every 5 days. The initial pH decreased from 6.40 to 4.10 and temperature stabilized at 26 degrees C. The mesophilic aerobic bacteria were quickly reduced across time. Enterococci were descended gradually. Clostridia remained in a low quantity. The microorganisms most frequently isolated were Escherichia coli, Clostridium butyricum, Enterococcus faecalis and Lactobacillus plantarum; this acid lactic bacteria was the principal cause of the abundant production of anaerobic fermentation of sugars in the forage reaching the pH which maintained the silage in adequate conditions.
TI  - Identification of the UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide:L-alanine ligase for synthesis of branched peptidoglycan precursors in Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - Many species of gram-positive bacteria produce branched peptidoglycan precursors  resulting from the transfer of various L-amino acids or glycine from amino acyl-tRNA to the epsilon-amino group of L-lysine. The UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide:L-alanine ligase and alanyl-tRNA synthetase genes from Enterococcus faecalis were identified, cloned, and overexpressed in Escherichia coli. The purified enzymes were necessary and sufficient for tRNA-dependent addition of L-alanine to UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide in vitro. The ligase belonged to the Fem family of proteins, which were initially identified genetically as factors essential for methicillin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - The LuxS family of bacterial autoinducers: biosynthesis of a novel quorum-sensing signal molecule.
AB  - Many bacteria control gene expression in response to cell population density, and this phenomenon is called quorum sensing. In Gram-negative bacteria, quorum sensing typically involves the production, release and detection of acylated homoserine lactone signalling molecules called autoinducers. Vibrio harveyi, a Gram-negative bioluminescent marine bacterium, regulates light production in response to two distinct autoinducers (AI-1 and AI-2). AI-1 is a homoserine lactone. The structure of AI-2 is not known. We have suggested previously that V. harveyi uses AI-1 for intraspecies communication and AI-2 for interspecies communication. Consistent with this idea, we have shown that many species of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria produce AI-2 and, in every case, production of AI-2 is dependent on the function encoded by the luxS gene. We show here that LuxS is the AI-2 synthase and that AI-2 is produced from S-adenosylmethionine in three enzymatic steps. The substrate for LuxS is S-ribosylhomocysteine, which is cleaved to form two products, one of which is homocysteine, and the other is AI-2. In this report, we also provide evidence that the biosynthetic pathway and biochemical intermediates in AI-2 biosynthesis are identical in Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, V. harveyi, Vibrio cholerae and Enterococcus faecalis. This result suggests that, unlike quorum sensing via the family of related homoserine lactone autoinducers, AI-2 is a unique, 'universal' signal that could be used by a variety of bacteria for communication among and between species.
TI  - Dental unit waterlines: review and product evaluation.
AB  - Dental practitioners must be knowledgeable regarding microbial contamination and  biofilm formation in dental unit waterlines. Education should stress the need for improvement in the quality of water delivered to patients during treatment. Manufacturers must also play an important role by providing training and education regarding the proper use and maintenance of their systems. Dental facilities, both public and private, need reliable methods to prevent the development of biofilms within DUWs. These methods must be economical and require minimal effort to use on the part of the dental staff. In order for the system to work efficiently, the effluent water that is produced must be compatible with dental materials and be potentially free from toxic or carcinogenic materials. There are numerous models of water filtration units and chemical flushes available to the dental practitioner. However, the Food and Drug Administration have not approved all products currently on the market. Our evaluation of Zerosil, a new waterline-cleaning product, indicates that it is very easy to use and is extremely effective in killing the commonly found microorganisms in dental unit waterlines, as well as eliminating existing biofilms. It is also economical and requires minimum staff time to keep the waterlines clean. Following the initial treatments during week one, the water emanating from the DUWs was free from any viable microorganisms. This effect was present the entire three weeks in which the waterlines were treated. The elimination of viable microorganisms continued into a fourth study week, even though no further treatment of the DUWs was performed. Although the manufacturer recommends weekly treatment of DUWs following the initial treatment regimen, this result indicates that the product has a longer lasting effect than previously thought. Finally, the product can be delivered through any of the commercially available reservoir/bottle water delivery systems. From our study, Zerosil appears to meet the demanding requirements of keeping dental unit waterlines clean. Based on the research that has been done thus far, no universal treatment protocol can be recommended. A combination of approaches may offer the best available assurance of high-quality dental treatment water. Independent water reservoir systems, when used with a periodic chemical treatment protocol, have demonstrated safety and efficacy. Until we reach a point when a recommendation based on thorough evaluations can be made, dental offices should follow current ADA, OSAP, and CDC guidelines: flush waterlines for two to three minutes at the beginning of each day and for 20 to 30 seconds between each patient, and anti-retraction valves should be installed to prevent oral fluids from being drawn into dental waterlines. It is expected that in the near future, the dental practitioner will have a choice of proven systems and products to deal with this issue. Until that time, one should carefully evaluate any product or system being considered to prevent the formation of biofilms in DUWs.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of leaf essential oils and their constituents from Cinnamomum osmophloeum.
AB  - The antibacterial activities of the essential oils from leaves of two Cinnamomum  osmophloeum clones (A and B) and their chemical constituents were investigated in this study. The nine strains of bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella sp., and Vibrio parahemolyticus, were used in the antibacterial tests. Results from the antibacterial tests demonstrated that the indigenous cinnamon B leaf essential oils had an excellent inhibitory effect. The MICs (minimum inhibitory concentrations) of the B leaf oil were 500 microg/ml against both K. pneumoniae and Salmonella sp. and 250 microg/ml against the other seven strains of bacteria. Cinnamaldehyde possessed the strongest antibacterial activity compared to the other constituents of the essential oils. The MICs of cinnamaldehyde against the E. coli, P. aeruginosa, E. faecalis, S. aureus, S. epidermidis, MRSA, K. pneumoniae, Salmonella sp., and V. parahemolyticus were 500, 1000, 250, 250, 250, 250, 1000, 500, and 250 microg/ml, respectively. These results suggest that C. osmophloeum leaf essential oil and cinnamaldehyde are beneficial to human health, having the potential to be used for medical purposes and to be utilized as anti-bacterial additives in making paper products.
TI  - Etiologies of the urinary tract infections in a Yemeni City.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the causative agents of urinary tract infection in Yemeni patients in Sana'a city, and to determine the antibiotic susceptibilities of these agents in vitro. METHODS: Consecutive mid-stream urine specimens were submitted to our laboratory by 4029 patients in Sana'a city from 1990 to the end of 1999. The specimens were cultured and the isolates were identified using standard microbiological techniques. The antibiotic susceptibilities of the isolates were also determined (in vitro). RESULTS: The number of patients with urinary tract infection who yielded positive cultures from their mid stream urine specimens was 685 out of 4029 patients (17%). The ratio of female-to-male patients was 462:223 (2.07:1). The causative agents were mainly members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, 579 out of the 685 isolates (84.5%). Escherichia coli was the main pathogen, 357 isolates out of all the isolates (52%) followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae, 143 isolates (21%) and Proteus species, 56 isolates (8%). The other pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter aerogenes, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Corynebacterium urealyticum and Enterococcus faecalis) constituted 129 out of the 685 isolates (19%). There was a shift in the types of the causative agents of urinary tract infection between the first and 2nd halves of the study period. The isolation of Escherichia coli decreased from 60% in the first half to 42% in the 2nd. Whereas Klebsiella pneumoniae increased from 16% in the first half to 27% in the 2nd, Proteus species from 8% to 9%, Staphylococcus aureus from 5% to 7%, Pseudomonas aeruginosa from 3% to 7%, Enterobacter aerogenes from 3% to 3.5%, Staphylococcus saprophyticus from 2% to 3% and Corynebacterium urealyticum from 1% to 2%. Ninety percent of all the urinary pathogens were sensitive to ciprofloxacin, 75% to nitrofurantoin, 57% to gentamicin, 46% to cefaclor, 46% to nalidixic acid, 39% to doxycycline, 37% to co-trimoxazole and 20% to ampiclox. CONCLUSION: The types of urinary tract pathogens and their antibiotic susceptibilities in addition to the rate of isolation from male and female patients are reported. It is recommended that ciprofloxacin and nitrofurantoin or both are used in the blind treatment of urinary tract infection while awaiting the culture and sensitivity results. It is also recommended to continuously monitor the pattern of urinary pathogens from the community to guide the blind treatment of patients in the future.
TI  - Development of systemic bacteraemia after oral inoculation of vancomycin-resistant enterococci in mice.
AB  - Bacteraemia caused by vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) is an important clinical problem because there are only a few potent antimicrobial agents against such bacteria. Therefore, understanding the pathogenic mechanisms of VRE bacteraemia is important for prophylaxis. This study shows that treatment of mice with cyclophosphamide and a combination of metronidazole, kanamycin and vancomycin reduced normal intestinal flora and induced systemic VRE bacteraemia. Translocation of VRE and the normal intestinal flora to the mesenteric lymph nodes, liver, spleen and blood, and mortality rate were dependent on treatment with cyclophosphamide and each of the three antimicrobial drugs. Among the different strains studied, C57BL/6 mice were the most susceptible to VRE. The virulence of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis was greater than that of vancomycin-resistant Ent. faecium. On the day after inoculation of VRE, Escherichia coli was also detected in many VRE-positive specimens including blood, liver and the mesenteric lymph nodes. Moreover, both VRE and E. coli were detected simultaneously in almost all blood samples obtained from dead and dying mice, and VRE organisms outnumbered E. coli in those samples by 100:1 or more. These results indicate that changes in normal intestinal flora by administration of antimicrobial drugs and severity of neutropenia induced by cyclophosphamide are important factors that contribute to the development of systemic VRE bacteraemia. E. coli may be intimately associated with the establishment of VRE translocation.
TI  - Tract microflora in Saudi patients with cholelithiasis.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To identify the microflora in the gallbladder of patients undergoing  laparoscopic cholecystectomy for gallstones, and the antibiotic susceptibility pattern of the isolates, as well as the usefulness of Gram staining of bile at the time of operation. METHODS: Bile samples were obtained from 112 patients undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy for gallstones and inoculated directly into aerobic and anaerobic blood culture bottles in the operating theatre. Samples were also collected in sterile universal containers for Gram staining of a centrifuged deposit. Isolates were identified and their in-vitro susceptibilities determined by Kirby Bauer technique. RESULTS: Of 112 bile samples examined, 28 (25%) were culture positive, four of which contained more than one organism. The most common organisms isolated were Escherichia coli 9 (28.1%), Enterococcus faecalis 5 (15.6%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa 3 (9.4%). In one sample we found Aeromonas hydrophilia and Enterobacter cloacae. No anaerobes were detected but Candida albicans was isolated in one case. In 19 bile samples (67.8%) organisms were identified on Gram stain. Positive bile cultures were found statistically significant (P < 0.05) in patients over the age of 50 (13/32), in patients who developed post-operative fever (6/12) and patients who developed leucocytosis (5/6). CONCLUSION: Age over 50 years was the only significant pre-operative factor associated with positive bile cultures (P < 0.05). In view of the microflora of the gallbladder and the susceptibility pattern of our isolates we would suggest that antibiotic prophylaxis recommended for laparoscopic cholecystectomy for gallstones needs to be reviewed and the role of bacteribilia in the surgical management of cholelithiasis requires further study.
TI  - Importance of hand germ contamination in health-care workers as possible carriers of nosocomial infections.
AB  - The importance of hands in the transmission of nosocomial infection has been world wide admitted. However, it is difficult to induce this behavior in health-care workers. The aim of the present work was to point out the importance of hand bacteria colonization, the influence of hand washing and of patient physical examination. One hundred health-care workers were randomly divided in two groups: Group A without hand washing previous to patient physical examination or handling (PPE); group B with hand washing previous to PPE. Direct fingerprint samples in Columbia agar before and after PPE were obtained. The colonies were counted and identified by conventional techniques, and antibiograms according to NCCLS were performed. Before PPE group A participants showed a high number of bacteria regarding group B participants (73.9 Vs 20.7; p < 0.001); 44 out of 50 participants were carriers of potentially pathogen bacteria. No group B participants were carriers of potential pathogen bacteria before PPE. The latter group showed an increase in number of bacteria after PPE (20.7 CFU (before) Vs 115.9 CFU (after); p < 0.001). Sixteen group B participants were contaminated after PPE with potential pathogens such as S. aureus (50% of them methicillin resistant); Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus faecalis, half of them multiresistant. We can conclude on the importance of these results to implement educational programs and to provide the health-care workers with the proper commodities to fulfill this practice.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin in a North American surveillance study.
AB  - The in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, was compared to three marketed fluoroquinolones; ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin against over 4,000 recent clinical isolates covering 29 species isolated in the United States and Canada between 1997-1999. Based on MIC(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent fluoroquinolone tested against a majority of Gram-positive isolates: Streptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin resistant S. pneumoniae, macrolide resistant S. pneumoniae, ciprofloxacin non-susceptible (MIC > or = 4 microg/mL) S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, viridans streptococci, Enterococcus faecalis, methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. hemolyticus, and S. saprophyticus. Against Enterobacteriaceae and aerobic non-Enterobacteriaceae Gram-negatives, gemifloxacin was usually comparable to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and more potent than ofloxacin for the following species: Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Morganella morganii, Proteus mirabilis, P. vulgaris, Providencia stuartii, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter lwoffii, A. baumannii, Burkholderia cepacia, Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Gemifloxacin was generally 16-64 fold more potent than the other fluoroquinolones tested against Gram-positive organisms and retains excellent activity comparable with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin against a majority of Gram-negative pathogens.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Marula (Sclerocarya birrea (A. rich.) Hochst. subsp. caffra (Sond.) Kokwaro) (Anacardiaceae) bark and leaves.
AB  - Marula bark is widely used for bacteria-related diseases by indigenous cultures in Africa. This study was undertaken to investigate whether the ethnobotanical use can be validated by laboratory studies. Bark and leaves were extracted with acetone and MIC values were determined using a microplate serial dilution technique with Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis as test organisms. All extracts were active with MIC values from 0.15 to 3 mg/ml. Based on minimum inhibitory concentration values, inner bark extracts tended to be the most potent followed by outer bark and leaf extracts, but the differences were not statistically significant. There were two major bioactive components visible after bioautography of leaf extracts: one strongly polar and the other highly non-polar. The bioactive components could be separated from 92% of the non-active dry matter by solvent-solvent fractionation into the carbon tetrachloride, chloroform and n-butanol fractions; these fractions, however, still contained many different compounds. Using bark may be detrimental to the plant, but leaf material can also be used for antibacterial application.
TI  - Inhibition of adhesion of food-borne pathogens to Caco-2 cells by Lactobacillus strains.
AB  - AIMS: To select adhesive strains among strains of Lactobacillus and to apply them to inhibit adhesion of food-borne pathogens. METHODS AND RESULTS: Twelve Lactobacillus strains (10 from intestine) were examined for adhesion using Caco-2 cell cultures. The two most adhesive strains, Lactobacillus crispatus JCM 8779 and Lact. reuteri JCM 1081, were used to test antiadhesion activity against enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium and Enterococcus faecalis strains. Adhesion of the pathogens was inhibited by both Lactobacillus strains. Adhesion of Ent. faecalis was especially strongly inhibited by JCM 8779. Although antimicrobial activity was not detected in the culture supernatant fluid by agar well diffusion assay, the supernatant fluid obtained from the harvested JCM 8779 cell suspension showed bactericidal activity against Ent. faecalis. CONCLUSION: The strong antiadhesion activity of JCM 8779 against Ent. faecalis appears to be due to the combined effect of both bactericidal activity and competition for attachment site. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This is the first report that Lact. crispatus produces a bactericidal substance.
TI  - Urinary tract infections in general practice in a rural community in South Trinidad.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: A prospective study was carried out at a General Practice in South Trinidad, to assess the sensitivity profiles of urinary isolates in this remote rural community. METHODS: Quantitative bacteriologic cultures were performed according to standard procedures. Identification of isolates was based on gram reaction, morphology and biochemical reactions. Susceptibility testing was carried out using commonly prescribed antimicrobials for the treatment of urinary tract infections. RESULTS: From 779 urine specimens, 49% were culture positive for counts >105 organisms per ml. Three hundred and eighteen were aged 21 years and above and 85.5% of these were females. The lowest incidence of urinary tract infections, 8%, was seen among the 13-20 year old age group. Most males above 50 years had indwelling urethral catheters due to prostatic disease. Escherichia coli was the predominant isolate, 71%, followed by Proteus mirabilis, 9%, and Klebsiella pneumoniae, 7%. All urinary tract infections isolates were fully sensitive to ofloxacin and >96% (except for Citrobacter species, 63%) were sensitive to cefuroxime. Apart from Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus saprophyticus, the overall sensitivity to ampicillin by all isolates was <33%. The prevalence of multi-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa in community-acquired urinary tract infections is increasing. All Pseudomonas aeruginosa were fully sensitive to gentamicin and ofloxacin. CONCLUSION: The high frequency of single and multiple antibiotic resistances in this rural community should cause alarm. The ease of procuring antibiotics in these areas without a prescription can result in uncontrolled self-medication. Also, the absence of antibiotic prescribing policies and inadequate information on patterns of bacterial resistance, may all contribute to the emergence of resistant strains.
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial properties of N-substituted derivatives of (E)-4-azachalcones.
AB  - Syntheses of 11 new N-bromoalkyl substituted bromides of (E)-4-azachalcone and N-o-(m- and p-) halobenzyl substituted halides of (E)-3'-hydroxy-4-azachalcone of antimicrobial activity are reported. Compounds 3d, 3e, 6b, 6c, and 6e reveal good antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis as well as moderate activity against Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae.
TI  - Activity of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin against urinary pathogens.
AB  - This study compares the antibacterial activities of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin against recently isolated urinary tract pathogens, by evaluating their MICs and MBCs in accordance with NCCLS susceptibility tests, time-kill curves and interference with bacterial adhesion to uroepithelial cells. A total of 200 clinical isolates was tested, including the species Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Providencia rettgeri, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. All E. coli isolates were susceptible to levofloxacin and only one was resistant to ciprofloxacin, and there were no differences between beta-lactamase-positive and -negative strains. K. pneumoniae strains resistant to ciprofloxacin were also resistant to levofloxacin. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus seemed to be less susceptible than methicillin-susceptible strains to these quinolones. S. epidermidis strains were susceptible to levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, with the exception of two isolates. Incubation of S. aureus and E. coli with subinhibitory antimicrobial concentrations reduced their capacity to adhere to uroepithelial cells; this was statistically significant at 0.25 x MIC with respect to controls (P < 0.05). Inhibition of adhesion ranged from 36 to 43% when bacteria were incubated in the presence of 0.25 x MIC of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, and from 10 to 27% at 0.125 x MIC. These findings suggest that levofloxacin is an effective alternative to ciprofloxacin in the treatment of urinary tract infections and that sub-inhibitory concentrations may contribute to efficacy.
TI  - Synthesis of some benzimidazole derivatives and their antibacterial and antifungal activities.
AB  - A number of new benzimidazole derivatives were synthesized by the reaction of benzimidazole with appropriate alkyl halides. The compounds synthesized were intensified by 1H-NMR, Fourier Transformation Infrared (FT-IR) and micro analysis. All new and related compounds studied in this work were screened for their in vitro antimicrobial activities against the standard strains: Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29212), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 29213), Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853) and the yeasts Candida albicans and Candida tropicalis. Eleven of the compounds were found effective to inhibit the growth of Gram-positive bacteria (E. faecalis and S. aureus) at MIC values between 12.5-400 micrograms/ml. None of the compounds exhibited antimicrobial activity against Gram-negative bacteria (E. coli and P. aeruginosa) at the concentrations studied (6.25-800 micrograms/ml). All compounds (except compound 3) were significantly effective against C. tropicalis with MIC values of 6.25-400 micrograms/ml. Eight of the tested compounds showed an antifungal activity against C. albicans with a range of the MICs between 50 and 400 micrograms/ml.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of intestinal bacteria from Swiss poultry flocks before the ban of antimicrobial growth promoters.
AB  - From the crop and the caecum of Swiss broilers slaughtered between November 1997  and January 1998, Escherichia coli, enterococci, staphylococci, lactobacilli and Campylobacter species were isolated. After identification to the genus or species level, their minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC's) for several clinically used antimicrobial agents were determined with the E-Test stripes and compared to those from studies in other European countries. All strains of Enterococcus faecalis (n = 38), E. faecium (27), staphylococci (n = 39) and lactobacilli (n = 14) showed a hundred percent resistance against bacitracin which was included in the feed of the mother animals, but not in the feed of the investigated animals. E.coli strains (n = 60) showed higher resistance incidences than in comparable studies from Finland and Denmark, but lower than those in studies from Italy and Germany. In staphylococci, low resistance rates were observed. A high susceptibility of the 13 Campylobacter jejuni strains was found against therapeutically used antimicrobials. These data can be used as a baseline to determine antibiotic resistance rates after implementation of the growth promotor ban in 1999 in Switzerland.
TI  - [Post-traumatic bacterial meningitis].
AB  - 10 patients with posttraumatic bacterial meningitis were treated in the Department of Infectious Diseases of the Jagielloniam University--Collegium Medicum during the period of 63 months. Traffic accidents were responsible for 80% of all cases of trauma. The most common place of injury was the base of anterior cranial fossa. Infecting agent was established in 8 cases. Gram-positive aerobic cocci (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, and Enterococcus spp.) were found in 4 patients, Gram-negative aerobic cocci (Neisseria meningitidis) in 2 patients, and Gram-negative aerobic rods (Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella spp, Escherichia coli) in 3 patients. Streptococcus pneumoniae was still highly sensitive to penicillin, ampicillin and cefotaxime. Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus spp. were sensitive to vancomycin and teicoplanin. Neisseria meningitidis was sensitive to penicillin, cefotaxime, amoxicillin/clavulonate. Gram negative aerobic rods were sensitive to third-generation cephalosporins, carbapenems and aminoglycosides. Among 10 patients treated for posttraumatic bacterial meningitis 1 patient died and in 1 preserved vegetative state was diagnosed. In 4 patients severe or moderate disabilities developed, however 4 recovered completely. 6 patients after regression of the CNS infection were qualified to neurosurgical intervention. In 3 patients reconstructive operation of the basis of anterior cranial fossa with tissue glue Beriplast P. was done, the recovery was complete. 3 patients didn't agree to surgical operation, and we don't know what has happened with them. They have not come to the control visit.
TI  - Intrauterine infection may be a major cause of stillbirth in Sweden.
AB  - AIM OF THE STUDY: To investigate intrauterine infection as a cause for unexplained stillbirth. METHODS: Chorioamnionitis was studied in a material of stillbirths (117 subjects from the years 1985-1994) from a region in the south Sweden. Control material (126 alive and healthy newborns and with healthy mothers) was gathered from the same region. RESULTS: Chorioamnionitis was a common diagnosis both with stillbirths and 'healthy' deliveries (82 and 68%, respectively). Extension of the inflammation to decidua basalis was seven times more common among stillbirths than among controls (odds ratio 7.2, confidence interval 2.8-21.9). The most common bacteria found at cultures were Escherichia coli, Coagulase negative staphylococcus, Enterococcus faecalis and group B Streptococcus. The risk for stillbirth was doubled if both inflammation and bacteria were present (odds ratio 2.3, confidence interval 0.92-5.8). Meconium discharge was more common among stillbirths than controls (odds ratio=4.7, confidence interval 1.7-14). There were no differences in any respect regarding macerated and non-macerated stillbirths. Our findings are similar to the results from studies in developing countries except for the higher incidence of stillbirths in such countries. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, a large part of otherwise unexplained stillbirths might be due to ascending infections.
TI  - [Pattern of antimicrobial susceptibility in uropathogen isolates from children].
AB  - The bacteriological profile in children with culture-positive bacteriuria was analyzed during a 5-year period. Escherichia coli was the most common cause of urinary tract infections (57%), followed by Streptococcus faecalis (11%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8%), and Proteus mirabilis (6%). Results of antimicrobial susceptibility testing indicated that cephalosporins (first, second and third generation) and nitrofurantoin are the best empirical oral treatment for urinary infections in children. Fosfomycin is a valid option in some cases. In hospitalized children treatment must be initiated with a third-generation cephalosporin, and gentamicin can be added in severely ill inpatients. These treatments can be modified when microbiological results become available.
TI  - Identification of novel essential Escherichia coli genes conserved among pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - We deleted a subset of 27 open reading frames (ORFs) from Escherichia coli which  encode previously uncharacterized, probably soluble gene products homologous to proteins from a broad spectrum of bacterial pathogens such as Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Enterococcus faecalis and only distantly related to eukaryotic proteins. Six novel bacteria-specific genes essential for growth in complex medium could be identified through a combination of bioinformatics-based and experimental approaches. We also compared our data to published results of gene inactivation projects with Mycoplasma genitalium and Bacillus subtilis and looked for homologs in all known prokaryotic genomes. Such analyses highlight the enormous metabolic flexibility of prokaryotes. Six of 27 studied genes have been functionally characterized up to now, amongst these four of the essential genes. The gene products YgbP, YgbB and YchB are involved in the non-mevalonate pathway of isoprenoid biosynthesis. KdtB is characterized as the posphopantetheine adenylyltransferase CoaD. There are indications that the other two essential gene products YjeE and YqgF, which we have identified, also possess enzymatic functions. These findings demonstrate the potential of such proteins to be used in screening of large chemical libraries for inhibitors which could be further developed to novel broad-spectrum antibiotics.
TI  - Complement evasion by Borrelia burgdorferi: serum-resistant strains promote C3b inactivation.
AB  - The most characteristic features of the Lyme disease pathogens, the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (s.l.) group, are their ability to invade tissues and to circumvent the immune defenses of the host for extended periods of time, despite elevated levels of borrelia-specific antibodies in serum and other body fluids. Our aim in the present study was to determine whether B. burgdorferi is able to interfere with complement (C) at the level of C3 by accelerating C3b inactivation and thus to inhibit the amplification of the C cascade. Strains belonging to different genospecies (Borrelia garinii, B. burgdorferi sensu stricto, and Borrelia afzelii) were compared for their sensitivities to normal human serum and abilities to promote factor I-mediated C3b degradation. B. burgdorferi sensu stricto and B. afzelii strains were found to be serum resistant. When the spirochetes were incubated with radiolabeled C3b, factor I-mediated degradation of C3b was observed in the presence of C-resistant B. afzelii (n = 3) and B. burgdorferi sensu stricto (n = 1) strains but not in the presence of C-sensitive B. garinii (n = 7) strains or control bacteria (Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis). Immunoblotting and radioligand binding analyses showed that the C-resistant strains had the capacity to acquire the C inhibitors factor H and factor H-like protein 1 (FHL-1) from growth medium and human serum. A novel surface protein with an apparent molecular mass of 35 kDa was found to preferentially bind to the N terminus region of factor H. Thus, the serum-resistant B. burgdorferi s.l. strains can circumvent C attack by binding the C inhibitors factor H and FHL-1 to their surfaces and promoting factor I-mediated C3b degradation.
TI  - Contact imidazole activity against resistant bacteria and fungi.
AB  - The activities of miconazole and miconazole sulphosalicylate were evaluated by a  contact test using strains of Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli and Candida spp selected for their resistance. The results showed that killing of the organisms occurred within a few minutes. Imidazole activity required a medium of low electrical conductivity and a pH of 5.6. Greater sensitivity could be obtained with pretreatment of the microbial suspensions with sodium dioctylsulphosuccinate. Microorganisms tested in culture media with low electrical conductivity and at pH 5.6 showed enhanced sensitivity to azoles with MIC values about 20-30 times lower than those obtained using control media. Practical implications of the use of topical drugs are discussed.
TI  - Probiotic activities of Lactobacillus casei rhamnosus: in vitro adherence to intestinal cells and antimicrobial properties.
AB  - The interest of probiotics as remedies for a broad number of gastrointestinal and other infectious diseases has gained wide interest over the last few years, but little is known about their underlying mechanism of action. In this study, the probiotic activities of a human isolate of Lactobacillus casei subsp. rhamnosus strain (Lcr35) were investigated. Using intestinal Caco-2 cell line in an in vitro model, we demonstrated that this strain exhibited adhesive properties. The inhibitory effects of Lcr35 organisms on the adherence of three pathogens, enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC), enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) and Klebsiella pneumoniae, were determined. A decrease in the number of adhering pathogens was observed, using either preincubation, postincubation or coincubation of the pathogens with Lcr35. Moreover, the antibacterial activities of cell-free Lcr35 supernatant was examined against nine human pathogenic bacteria, ETEC, EPEC, K. pneumoniae, Shigella flexneri, Salmonella typhimurium, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis and Clostridium difficile. The growth of all strains was inhibited, as measured by determining the number of viable bacteria over time, but no bactericidal activity was detected in this in vitro assay. Together, these findings suggest that this probiotic strain could be used to prevent colonization of the gastrointestinal tract by a large variety of pathogens.
TI  - [Identification of microbial subtypes from antibiotic susceptibility data in clinical laboratory for nosocomial infection surveillance].
AB  - We developed an algorism to identify microbial subtypes automatically from daily  antibiotic susceptibility data in clinical microbiology laboratory. The susceptibility pattern was expressed as a string of digits, each consisting of 0(resistant), 1(intermediate) or 2(susceptible) to respective antibiotics. Any two patterns were regarded identical and combined if the difference at each digit never exceeds 1. The combined pattern was expressed as an array of digit-by-digit weighted averages of the two. The second combination was based on a degree of similarity among the numerical patterns using a formula, which was designed to emphasize differences in highly variable elements. This subgrouping procedure was done every three months. Identity of the detected subtypes between the intervals was determined using the same algorism as for the second combination. The algorism was applied to data of clinical isolates of MRSA, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA), Klebsiella pneumoniae (KP), Enterococcus faecalis (EF), Streptococcus pneumoniae (SP), Escherichia coli (EC) that were obtained over a period of 4 years. Three major subtypes of MRSA, KP and EF were consistently detected with shifting mutual frequencies. Most of EC isolates belonged to two consistent subtypes. Although PA and SP had one or two consistent subtypes, there were multiple minor subtypes of varying frequencies. This analysis is regarded as an "infotyping", in contrast to serotype or genotype, of clinical microbial isolates, which is useful for nosocomial infection surveillance.
TI  - A novel heterodimeric antimicrobial peptide from the tree-frog Phyllomedusa distincta.
AB  - We present here the purification and the analysis of the structural and functional properties of distinctin, a 5.4 kDa heterodimeric peptide with antimicrobial activity from the tree-frog Phyllomedusa distincta. This peptide was isolated from the crude extract of skin granular glands by different chromatographic steps. Its minimal inhibitory concentration was determined against pathogenic Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains. Amino acid sequencing and mass spectrometric investigations demonstrated that distinctin is constituted of two different polypeptide chains connected by an intermolecular disulphide bridge. Circular dichroism and Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy studies showed that this molecule adopts, in water, a structure containing a significant percentage of anti-parallel beta-sheet. A conformational variation was observed under experimental conditions mimicking a membrane-like environment. Database searches did not show sequence similarities with any known antimicrobial peptides. In the light of these results, we can consider distinctin as the first example of a new class of antimicrobial heterodimeric peptides from frog skin.
TI  - Oral fluoroquinolone therapy results in drug adsorption on ureteral stents and prevention of biofilm formation.
AB  - The oral administration of ciprofloxacin (250mg bid) and ofloxacin (300mg bid) in 40 patients with ureteral stents, led to drug levels on all the device surfaces that were higher than the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of Escherichia coli (0.004--0.015 mg/l), the most common uropathogen. The drug levels in the film were higher than the MIC of other common pathogens, namely Pseudomonas aeruginosa (0.25--1.0 mg/l), Enterococcus faecalis (0.25--2.0 mg/l) and Staphylococcus aureus (0.12--0.5 mg/l) in a few cases (six, three and 14 cases out of 40, respectively). For both antibiotics, the concentrations were greater than the MIC of many uropathogens on the film surrounding the devices (0.89 vs 0.31 mg/l respectively, P=0.05), and on the devices themselves (0.22 vs. 0.12 mg/l, P=0.207). Adsorption of the antibiotics was higher to the film than to the stent (P<0.0001). Ciprofloxacin concentration on the film surrounding the stents was significantly higher than that of ofloxacin (P=0.05), while there was no statistical concentration difference between the two antibiotics adsorbed onto the actual devices (P=0.207). No bacteria were found in patients' urine and no biofilms were detected. This is the first report of an oral antibiotic being adsorbed onto medical devices. It potentially provides a new approach of preventing infection, and avoids the need to pre-coat devices with agents whose use will be restricted once bacteria develop resistance to them. If biomaterial properties can be enhanced to increase further the adsorptive concentration of drug, the risk of infections and recalcitrant biofilm formation could be significantly reduced in a highly susceptible patient population.
TI  - Antibodies to a surface-exposed, N-terminal domain of aggregation substance are not protective in the rabbit model of Enterococcus faecalis infective endocarditis.
AB  - The aggregation substance (AS) surface protein from Enterococcus faecalis has been implicated as an important virulence factor for the development of infective endocarditis. To evaluate the role of antibodies specific for Asc10 (the AS protein from the conjugative plasmid pCF10) in protective immunity to infective endocarditis, an N-terminal region of Asc10 lacking the signal peptide and predicted to be surface exposed (amino acids 44 to 331; AS(44-331)) was cloned with a C-terminal histidine tag translational fusion and expressed from Escherichia coli. N-terminal amino acid sequencing of the purified protein revealed the correct sequence, and rabbit polyclonal antisera raised against AS(44-331) reacted specifically to Asc10 expressed from E. faecalis OG1SSp, but not to other proteins as judged by Western blot analysis. Using these antisera, flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that antibodies to AS(44-331) bound to a surface-exposed region of Asc10. Furthermore, antibodies specific for AS(44-331) were opsonic for E. faecalis expressing Asc10 in vitro but not for cells that did not express Asc10. New Zealand White rabbits immunized with AS(44-331) were challenged intravenously with E. faecalis cells constitutively expressing Asc10 in the rabbit model of experimental endocarditis. Highly immune animals did not show significant differences in clearance of organisms from the blood or spleen or in formation of vegetations on the aortic valve, in comparison with nonimmune animals. Although in vivo expression of Asc10 was demonstrated by immunohistochemistry, these experiments provide evidence that immunity to Asc10 does not play a role in protection from experimental infective endocarditis due to E. faecalis and may have important implications for the development of immunological approaches to combat enterococcal endocarditis.
TI  - Chlorination of pure bacterial cultures in aqueous solution.
AB  - The fate and distribution of chlorine in aqueous solutions containing four pure bacterial cultures was studied. Solutions were subjected to chlorination at different initial free chlorine concentrations. Resulting concentrations of residual chlorine were determined by both DPD/FAS titration and membrane introduction mass spectrometry (MIMS). In all cases, false-positive breakpoint chlorination curves, probably attributable to the formation of chloroorganic-N compounds, were observed by DPD/FAS titration, while little or no inorganic residual chloramine was found by MIMS. Free chlorine was observed in similar quantities by both methods after chlorine demand by bacterial cellular materials in solution was satisfied. These results indicated the residual chloramines existed in the form of organic chloramines; these compounds are generally recognized as being poor antimicrobial agents. Further investigation confirmed that the bacterial cells were the source of organic-N compounds. The kinetics of chlorination of pure bacterial suspensions was also studied. The pattern of residual chlorine decay following chlorination of the bacterial suspensions indicated rapid initial free chlorine consumption, followed by slow free chlorine consumption, with trace quantities of inorganic chloramine being formed.
TI  - Mdt(A), a new efflux protein conferring multiple antibiotic resistance in Lactococcus lactis and Escherichia coli.
AB  - The mdt(A) gene, previously designated mef214, from Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis plasmid pK214 encodes a protein [Mdt(A) (multiple drug transporter)] with 12 putative transmembrane segments (TMS) that contain typical motifs conserved among the efflux proteins of the major facilitator superfamily. However, it also has two C-motifs (conserved in the fifth TMS of the antiporters) and a putative ATP-binding site. Expression of the cloned mdt(A) gene decreased susceptibility to macrolides, lincosamides, streptogramins, and tetracyclines in L. lactis and Escherichia coli, but not in Enterococcus faecalis or in Staphylococcus aureus. Glucose-dependent efflux of erythromycin and tetracycline was demonstrated in L. lactis and in E. coli.
TI  - Lactobacillus plantarum reduces infection of pancreatic necrosis in experimental  acute pancreatitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Infection is the commonest cause of death in acute pancreatitis. Early reduction of commensal flora (particularly Lactobacillus species) and, at the same time, overgrowth of Enterobacteriaceae, especially Escherichia coli, have recently been described during acute pancreatitis. Lactobacillus plantarum has been shown to be effective in reducing the egress of endotoxin and microbial translocation in several experimental models such as chemically induced hepatitis and ulcerative colitis. AIM: The aim of the study was to determine whether L. plantarum 299v (Lp 299v) is capable of effectively reducing microbial translocation in experimental pancreatitis. METHODS: Acute pancreatitis was induced by isolation and ligation of the biliopancreatic duct in Lewis rats weighing 250-350 g. The animals were divided into 3 groups: group A, sham operation; group B, induction of pancreatitis and no further treatment, and group C, induction of pancreatitis + daily administration by gavage of a 5-ml/day suspension of Lp 299v at 0.5-1.0 x 10(9) bacteria/ml for 8 days, 4 days before and 4 days after induction of pancreatitis. All animals were sacrificed after 96 h. Histological studies and microbiological analyses were performed. RESULTS: At sacrifice, 40/55 animals showed signs of severe pancreatitis. Since acute pancreatitis was the specific disease investigated, only these animals were subjected to further study. In group B, we found pathogenic micro-organisms in the mesenteric lymph nodes in 14/20 animals and in the pancreatic tissue in 10/20. The bacterial flora consisted predominantly of E. coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas and Proteus species. In contrast, when the animals were kept under an 'umbrella' of Lp 299v, growth of E. faecalis or E. coli were detected only in 4/20 mesenteric lymph node cultures and in 3/20 pancreatic tissue cultures. CONCLUSIONS: Lp 299v is effective in reducing microbial translocation in experimental pancreatitis. Treatment with probiotic bacteria seems to be a promising alternative to antibiotic therapy.
TI  - Detection of cervical immunoglobulin A in normal pregnancy.
AB  - The aim of our study was to evaluate a feasible method to quantify the immunoglobulin A concentration in the cervical mucus of women with a normal singleton pregnancy. In 60 immunologic healthy pregnant women cervical mucus samples were taken at a random time in pregnancy using an absorbing cylindrical cotton-swab stick. In this cervical mucus immunoglobulin A concentration was measured by radial immunodiffusion. A vaginal bacterial swab was taken from each woman. Concentration of immunoglobulins in maternal serum was estimated. There was no statistically significant difference of cervical immunoglobulin A concentration between the investigated groups (p = 0.952): 18-24 gestational weeks (gw): 52.8 (6.6-258.4) mg/l; 25-29 gw: 89.3 (4.8-193.8) mg/l; 30-34 gw: 55 (1.4-326) mg/l; 35-40 gw: 59.2 (4-400.9) mg/l. Women with a normal vaginal flora showed a significantly higher cervical immunoglobulin A concentration than those with a pathological colonization: 92.2 (6.6-400.9) mg/l vs. 42.5 (1.4-326) mg/l (p < 0.05). The serum levels of immunoglobulins A, A1, A2, M and G do not correlate to cervical immunoglobulin A levels nor to gestational age. In normal pregnancy, cervical immunoglobulin A concentration does not change with advancing gestational age, but a pathological vaginal colonization seems to be associated with decreased immunoglobulin A levels.
TI  - Determination of the antibacterial efficacy of several antiseptics tested on skin by an 'ex-vivo' test.
AB  - There are many skin antiseptics commercially available. Although their antibacterial activity has often been well studied, their potential effectiveness on skin remains poorly documented. To date, in-vivo protocols designed for the testing of the antimicrobial efficacy of antiseptics cannot use, for ethical reasons, pathogenic bacteria or new formulations whose toxicity in human subjects is unknown. An 'ex-vivo' test was recently developed to overcome these problems. Freshly excised human skin from abdominal or breast reduction was placed in a diffusion cell containing a maintenance medium in the recipient compartment. A bacterial inoculum was then applied to the stratum corneum and, after a drying step, antiseptic formulations were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity. Several micro-organisms were investigated: - Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Enterococcus faecalis, vancomycin-resistant Ent. faecium (VRE), S. epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli--with several biocides--para-chloro-meta-xylenol (PCMX, active compound of Dettol), povidone iodine, triclosan (in isopropanol) and chlorhexidine. Results from the ex-vivo test were compared with results obtained in suspension and glass-carrier tests. The bactericidal activity of the biocides depended upon the test performed and results were generally significantly different from one method to the other. All biocides tested in the suspension test achieved >4 log10 reduction in viable bacterial concentrations, apart from povidone iodine tested against Ent. faecalis and VRE. The antibacterial activity of biocides tested in the glass-carrier test was significantly lower than in the suspension test, with the exception of triclosan in isopropanol, which was as effective in both suspension and glass-carrier test. In the ex-vivo test, triclosan in isopropanol achieved a log10 reduction in viable bacterial concentration of 1.105-1.771 (with the exception of P. aeruginosa with 0.758 log10 reduction). PCMX, povidone iodine and chlorhexidine achieved log10 reductions in viable bacterial concentration of 0.303-0.901. Chlorhexidine tested against P. aeruginosa produced a 1.94 log10 reduction in concentration. These results confirm previous observations about the need for testing the antimicrobial activity of antiseptics on skin surface to determine their in-situ efficacy and encourage further the use of the ex-vivo protocol.
TI  - pAM401-based shuttle vectors that enable overexpression of promoterless genes and one-step purification of tag fusion proteins directly from Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - Two novel Enterococcus faecalis-Escherichia coli shuttle vectors that utilize the promoter and ribosome binding site of bacA on the E. faecalis plasmid pPD1 were constructed. The vectors were named pMGS100 and pMGS101. pMGS100 was designed to overexpress cloned genes in E. coli and E. faecalis and encodes the bacA promoter followed by a cloning site and stop codon. pMGS101 was designed for the overexpression and purification of a cloned protein fused to a Strep-tag consisting of 9 amino acids at the carboxyl terminus. The Strep-tag provides the cloned protein with an affinity to immobilized streptavidin that facilitates protein purification. We cloned a promoterless beta-galactosidase gene from E. coli and cloned the traA gene of the E. faecalis plasmid pAD1 into the vectors to test gene expression and protein purification, respectively. beta-Galactosidase was expressed in E. coli and E. faecalis at levels of 10(3) and 10 Miller units, respectively. By cloning the pAD1 traA into pMGS101, the protein could be purified directly from a crude lysate of E. faecalis or E. coli with an immobilized streptavidin matrix by one-step affinity chromatography. The ability of TraA to bind DNA was demonstrated by the DNA-associated protein tag affinity chromatography method using lysates prepared from both E. coli and E. faecalis that overexpress TraA. The results demonstrated the usefulness of the vectors for the overexpression and cis/trans analysis of regulatory genes, purification and copurification of proteins from E. faecalis, DNA binding analysis, determination of translation initiation site, and other applications that require proteins purified from E. faecalis.
TI  - An intelligent rapid odour recognition model in discrimination of Helicobacter pylori and other gastroesophageal isolates in vitro.
AB  - Two series of experiments are reported which result in the discrimination between Helicobacter pylori and other bacterial gastroesophageal isolates using a newly developed odour generating system, an electronic nose and a hybrid intelligent odour recognition system. In the first series of experiments, after 5 h of growth (37 degrees C), 53 volatile 'sniffs' were collected over the headspace of complex broth cultures of the following clinical isolates: Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella sp., H. pylori, Enterococcus faecalis (10(7) ml(-1)), Mixed infection (Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, and E. faecalis 3 x 10(6) ml each) and sterile cultures. Fifty-six normalised variables were extracted from 14 conductive polymer sensor responses and analysed by a 3-layer back propagation neural network (NN). The NN prediction rate achieved was 98% and the test data (37.7% of all data) was recognised correctly. Successful clustering of bacterial classes was also achieved by discriminant analysis (DA) of a normalised subset of sensor data. Cross-validation identified correctly seven 'unknown' samples. In the second series of experiments after 150 min of microaerobic growth at 37 degrees C, 24 volatile samples were collected over the headspace of H. pylori cultures in enriched (HPP) and normal (HP) media and 11 samples over sterile (N) cultures. Forty-eight sensor parameters were extracted from 12 sensor responses and analysed by a 3-layer NN previously optimised by a genetic algorithm (GA). GA-NN analysis achieved a 94% prediction rate of 'unknown' data. Additionally the 'genetically' selected 16 input neurones were used to perform DA-cross validation that showed a clear clustering of three groups and reclassified correctly nine 'sniffs'. It is concluded that the most important factors that govern the performance of an intelligent bacterial odour detection system are: (a) an odour generation mechanism, (b) a rapid odour delivery system similar to the mammalian olfactory system, (c) a gas sensor array of high reproducibility and (d) a hybrid intelligent model (expert system) which will enable the parallel use of GA-NNs and multivariate techniques.
TI  - The bactericidal effect of Nd:YAG, Ho:YAG, and Er:YAG laser irradiation in the root canal: an in vitro comparison.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare the antibacterial effectiveness of the Nd:YAG, the Ho:YAG, and the Er:YAG laser in infected root canals. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Lasers are gaining increasing importance in the field of endodontics. Numerous studies have shown the beneficial effects of laser treatment in disinfecting root canals. METHODS: In our in vitro experimental setup, 40 extracted and endodontically treated teeth were inoculated with a suspension of Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis and then irradiated at standardized power settings. The disinfecting efficacy of each laser was proved by classical microbiological examination. RESULTS: This article highlights that all three lasers substantially decreased the bacterial population with only minimal differences in their microbicidal efficacy. At 1.5 W, the best results were obtained by the Er:YAG laser achieving a mean bacterial elimination of 99.64%, followed by the Nd:YAG laser (99.16%), and the Ho:YAG laser (99.05%). CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that all three lasers act as strongly effective microbicides without causing unfavorable temperature rises at the settings used. They can thus be considered a valuable tool for root canal treatment.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of antimicrobial activity of sealers and pastes used in endodontics.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of four root canal sealers (AH Plus, Sealapex, Ketac Endo, and Fill Canal), two calcium hydroxide pastes (Calen and Calasept), and a zinc oxide paste was evaluated. Seven bacterial strains were used, six of them standard; Micrococcus luteus ATCC 9341, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, and Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 10541. There was a wild strain of Streptococcus mutans isolated from saliva obtained in an adult dental clinic. Activity was evaluated using the agar diffusion method with Brain Heart Infusion agar and Muller Hinton medium seeded by pour plate. Calcium hydroxide-based sealers and pastes were either placed directly into 4.0 x 4.0 mm wells or by using absorbent paper points. The plates were kept at room temperature for 2 hr for diffusion. After incubation at 37 degrees C for 24 hr, the medium was optimized with 0.05 g% TTC gel and inhibition haloes were measured. All bacterial strains were inhibited by all materials using the well method. However, when the materials were applied with absorbent paper points, Enterococcus faecalis was not inhibited by zinc oxide, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was not inhibited by AH Plus, Fill Canal, and the zinc oxide-based paste. We conclude that sealers and pastes presented antimicrobial activity in vitro and culture medium optimization with 0.05 g% TTC gel facilitated observation of the inhibition haloes.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity and flow rate of newer and established root canal sealers.
AB  - Endodontic sealers that possess both optimum flow ability and antimicrobial properties may theoretically assist in the elimination of microorganisms located in confined areas of the root canal system. The antimicrobial effects and the flow rate of the following sealers were investigated and compared: Kerr Pulp Canal Sealer EWT, Grossman's Sealer, ThermaSeal, Sealer 26, AH Plus, and Sealer Plus. The agar diffusion test was used to assess the antimicrobial activity of the sealers. In the flow assay, the sealers were placed between two glass slabs and a weight of 500 g was placed on the top of the glass. The diameters of the formed discs were recorded. All root canal sealers tested showed some antimicrobial activity against most of the microorganisms. There were no significant differences between the materials tested (p > 0.05). All root canal sealers also flowed under the conditions of this study. Statistical analysis of the results revealed that AH Plus and Kerr Pulp Canal Sealer EWT had flow values significantly superior to the other sealers tested (p > 0.05). Taken together, these findings suggest that these sealers have the potential to help in the microbial control in the root canal system.

TI  - Analysis of the bacterial strains isolated from urine samples of hospitalized and ambulatory patients.
AB  - Bacteria of Enterococcus spp. are now much more often isolated from various diagnostic materials in systemic infection, both in hospitalized and in ambulatory patients. The study included 571 enterococci strains isolated from urine in 1997. Species identification was performed by rapid ID32 STREP test (bioMerieux) for 327 analyzed strains. Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium dominated (46.1% and 11.2%, respectively). Over 42% of strains were isolated from urine of patients with non-significant bacteriuria or as concomitant flora. In such cases, simplified identification was performed and the strains were determined as Enterococcus spp. The microorganisms analyzed originated primarily from the urine samples of patients hospitalized at the Department of Urology (41.8%), the Department of Neurology (11.9%) and the Department of Internal Medicine and Nephrology (9.9%). Enterococcus faecalis strains were second with respect to population count (263--10.6%), after Escherichia coli strains (464--18.8%), while Enterococcus faecium strains were the sixth (64--2.5%). Enterococcus genus took the first place among all microorganisms isolated from the urine samples. Antibiotic-sensitivity was determined for 323 enterococci strains originating from hospitalized and ambulatory patients. Enterococcus faecium strains, naturally resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics, were sensitive to nitrofuranoin in more than 50% and to norfloxacin in about 20%. Among 254 analyzed Enterococcus faecalis strains, 80.0% were sensitive to ampicillin, nitrofurantoin and high concentrations of gentamicin as well as streptomycin. Enterococci strains isolated from hospitalized patients proved sensitive to ampicillin and carbapenems in 76.8%, while strains isolated from ambulatory patients were 100% sensitive to these drugs. Examination of enterococci isolated from urine of patients hospitalized showed 33.8% sensitive to norfloxacin and 84.6% sensitive to nitrofurantoin. All the enterococci strains were sensitive to glycopeptide antibiotics: vancomycin, teicoplanin.
TI  - Expression of the major heat shock proteins DnaK and GroEL in Streptococcus pyogenes: a comparison to Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - One of the outstanding problems in the field of heat shock response has been to elucidate the mechanism underlying the induction of heat shock proteins (HSPs). In this work, we initiate an analysis of the expression of heat shock groEL and dnaK genes and their promoters in S. pyogenes. The synthesis of total cellular proteins was studied upon transfer of a log-phase culture from 37 degrees C to 42 degrees C by performing 5-min pulse-labeling experiments with (35)S-Met. The heat shock responses in the pathogenic Gram-positive cocci, Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus, were also analyzed.

TI  - Evaluation of calibrated 1 and 10 microl loops and dipslide as compared to pipettes for detection of low count bacteriuria in vitro.
AB  - Criteria for defining urinary tract infection have changed as the importance of low count bacteriuria in patients with symptoms of infection has been recognized. Little has been published, however, regarding the ability of routine laboratory methods to meet this new challenge. We compared 1 microl and 10 microl calibrated plastic loops (Nunc, Denmark), to a commonly used dipslide method (Uricult, Orion, Finland) using a 0.1 ml pipette as the gold standard. Four typical uropathogens, E. coli, P. aeruginosa, S. saprophyticus and E. faecalis, were mixed in pooled human urine in numbers representing low counts, i.e. 10(2), 10(3), and 10(4), together with 10(5) colony-forming units (cfu)/ml, and sampling with the four methods was performed 20 times for each with each bacterium and each dilution. Colony counts showed that in many cases the 1 microl loop did not deposit any bacteria on the agar plate when colony counts were lower than 10(4) cfu/ml. The 10 microl loop constantly deposited 1.5 times higher numbers of bacteria than predicted, which correlated with the results of weighing the amount of water sampled, i.e. 15.24 (1.55) microg (mean (SD)). The dipslide counts correlated with the 10 microl loop although the agar mounts on the slides absorbed water equal to about 200 microl. There were no significant differences in the counts of the four different bacteria. Variation coefficients increased with decreasing volumes sampled, but the 10 microl loop was found sufficiently exact to detect counts from 10(3) to 10(4), since only 10-fold multiples are usually reported for urine cultures.
TI  - Antibacterial properties of human amnion and chorion in vitro.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the present study was to explore the direct effects of  amnion and chorion on bacterial growth in vitro including the antibacterial spectrum. Chorioamniotic membranes were obtained under sterile conditions from 13 healthy women undergoing elective cesarean section at term. Likewise, chorioamniotic membranes were obtained from 10 healthy women with spontaneous vaginal delivery at term. Five strains of Hemolytic streptococci group B (GBS) were tested and one clinical isolate of the following species or bacterial groups: Hemolytic streptococcus group A, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and Lactobacillus species. Bacteriological media included (1) blood-agar medium; (2) a transparent agar medium for submerged cultures; and (3) a nutrient broth medium. RESULTS: An inhibitory effect of fetal membranes against a range of bacteria was found. Consistent results were obtained in experiments with cultures on agar and cultures suspended in agar (membranes from eight women in both studies). In experiments with liquid cultures (seven women) only chorion showed a marginal inhibitory effect. All strains were inhibited, but the most pronounced inhibition was obtained for streptococcus group A, S. aureus and S. saprophyticus by both chorion and amnion. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated an inhibitory effect of the fetal membranes on a diverse panel of bacteria
TI  - Activity of gatifloxacin and ciprofloxacin in combination with other antimicrobial agents.
AB  - The influence of non-quinolone antimicrobial agents on the antibacterial activities of gatifloxacin and ciprofloxacin was determined using chequerboard, fractional inhibitory concentration, (FIC) and time-kill analysis methods. In the chequerboard method, the quinolones were tested in combination with ten antimicrobial agents (macrolides, aminoglycosides, beta-lactams, vancomycin, rifampicin and chloramphenicol) against five bacterial strains (one strain each of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus pneumoniae). In no incidence was antagonism (FIC > or = 4) or synergy (FIC < or = 0.5) observed; all dual drug combinations involving gatifloxacin or ciprofloxacin showed additivity/indifference (FIC > 0.5, < 4). By time-kill analysis, the strains were tested at a quinolone concentration equal to 8 x MIC in combination with a second antibiotic at 0.5xits MIC. These combinations killed non-enterococcal strains at rates similar to those with quinolones alone. However, rifampicin and chloramphenicol were often antagonistic (100-fold lesser killing) to the lethal action of gatifloxacin and ciprofloxacin against E. faecalis. These findings indicate that, with the exception of E. faecalis, the antibacterial activities of quinolones are generally additive/indifferent to those of other antimicrobial agents.
TI  - Antibiotic activity and characterization of BB-3497, a novel peptide deformylase  inhibitor.
AB  - Peptide deformylase (PDF) is an essential bacterial metalloenzyme which deformylates the N-formylmethionine of newly synthesized polypeptides and as such represents a novel target for antibacterial chemotherapy. To identify novel PDF inhibitors, we screened a metalloenzyme inhibitor library and identified an N-formyl-hydroxylamine derivative, BB-3497, and a related natural hydroxamic acid antibiotic, actinonin, as potent and selective inhibitors of PDF. To elucidate the interactions that contribute to the binding affinity of these inhibitors, we determined the crystal structures of BB-3497 and actinonin bound to Escherichia coli PDF at resolutions of 2.1 and 1.75 A, respectively. In both complexes, the active-site metal atom was pentacoordinated by the side chains of Cys 90, His 132, and His 136 and the two oxygen atoms of N-formyl-hydroxylamine or hydroxamate. BB-3497 had activity against gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, and activity against some gram-negative bacteria. Time-kill analysis showed that the mode of action of BB-3497 was primarily bacteriostatic. The mechanism of resistance was via mutations within the formyltransferase gene, as previously described for actinonin. While actinonin and its derivatives have not been used clinically because of their poor pharmacokinetic properties, BB-3497 was shown to be orally bioavailable. A single oral dose of BB-3497 given 1 h after intraperitoneal injection of S. aureus Smith or methicillin-resistant S. aureus protected mice from infection with median effective doses of 8 and 14 mg/kg of body weight, respectively. These data validate PDF as a novel target for the design of a new generation of antibacterial agents.
TI  - Effect of insulin on microbial growth.
AB  - The ability of insulin to affect the growth kinetics of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was measured. For all organisms, insulin, in the absence of a metabolizable sugar source, i.e., glucose or starch in Mueller-Hinton medium, had no effect on generation time as compared with a homologous control. Response to insulin, in the form of increased or decreased generation times, for both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, was dependent on the concentration of insulin, the concentration of glucose present, and the initial concentration of bacteria exposed to the glucose and insulin.
TI  - Antimicrobial evaluation of certain plants used in Mexican traditional medicine for the treatment of respiratory diseases.
AB  - Eighteen crude extracts, including six hexanic, six chloroformic and six methanolic from six different plant species used in Mexican traditional medicine for the treatment of respiratory infections, were evaluated for potential antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, and Candida albicans. The minimal inhibitory concentration was determined for each extract using a two-fold dilution assay. The results showed that 16 crude extracts (89%) exhibited antimicrobial activity against at least one of the microorganisms tested at concentrations of 5 mg/ml or below. The extracts from Gnaphalium oxyphyllum, Gnaphalium americanum, and Crescentia alata possessed strong antimicrobial activity against the pathogens tested.
TI  - Bacterial adherence to silver nitrate coated poly-L-lactic acid urological stents in vitro.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to see whether it is possible to prevent bacterial  adherence to bioabsorbable self-reinforced L-lactic acid polymer (SR-PLLA) urological stents. The SR-PLLA stents were coated with silver nitrate blended epsilon-caprolactone/L-lactide copolymer. The adherence of five bacterial strains (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Proteus mirabilis and two strains of Escherichia coli) to coated and non-coated SR-PLLA wires were tested. It was found that silver nitrate coating prevented the adherence of bacteria (except E. faecalis) to SR-PLLA stents. The preventive effect correlated with the silver nitrate concentration. It was also found that silver nitrate coating reduced the amount of bacteria in ambient urine. In conclusion, silver nitrate coating may reduce stent-associated bacterial infections by preventing the adherence of bacteria. Further studies are needed to confirm its efficacy and safety in clinical practice.
TI  - Bacterial adherence to ofloxacin-blended polylactone-coated self-reinforced L-lactic acid polymer urological stents.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether ofloxacin coating has any effect on bacterial adherence to bioresorbable self-reinforced L-lactic acid polymer (SR-PLLA) urological stents. MATERIALS AND METHODS: SR-PLLA stents were coated with epsilon-caprolactone/L-lactide copolymer blended with ofloxacin at three different concentrations of ofloxacin (0.5, 2 and 5% w/w). The adherence of five bacterial strains (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Proteus mirabilis and two strains of Escherichia coli) to the coated SR-PLLA stents was analysed. Uncoated stent pieces were used as controls. The effect of ofloxacin coating on bacterial growth in the microenvironment of the stent pieces was also analysed. RESULTS: Ofloxacin coating prevented bacterial adherence to SR-PLLA stent material; this effect correlated significantly with the ofloxacin concentration of the caprolactone coating. Ofloxacin coating reduced the amount of bacteria in the microenvironment of the stent, but because of natural resistance, ofloxacin coating had little effect on E. faecalis. CONCLUSION: Except for E. faecalis, ofloxacin coating may reduce stent-associated infections. However, further studies are needed to confirm its biocompatibility and efficacy in clinical use.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of plant extracts from the families Fabaceae, Oleaceae, Philadelphaceae, Rosaceae and Staphyleaceae.
AB  - The selected plant extracts exhibited antibacterial activity. The strongest effect was manifested by extracts prepared from Gymnocladus dioicus, Amelanchier ovalis, Exochorda racemosa, Holodiscus discolor, Philadelphus microphyllus, Philadelphus coronarius and Pelargonium tabulare. The percentage inhibition of bacterial growth was 0-41.8%. In addition it was found that extracts isolated from Amelanchier ovalis, Exochorda racemosa and Pelargonium tabulare were specifically effective only against the bacterial strains tested.

TI  - Antibacterial activity of synthetic analogues based on the disaccharide structure of moenomycin, an inhibitor of bacterial transglycosylase.
AB  - Moenomycin is a natural product glycolipid that inhibits the growth of a broad spectrum of Gram-positive bacteria. In Escherichia coli, moenomycin inhibits peptidoglycan synthesis at the transglycosylation stage, causes accumulation of cell-wall intermediates, and leads to lysis and cell death. However, unlike Esc. coli, where 5-6 log units of killing are observed, 0-2 log units of killing occurred when Gram-positive bacteria were treated with similar multiples of the MIC. In addition, bulk peptidoglycan synthesis in intact Gram-positive cells was resistant to the effects of moenomycin. In contrast, synthetic disaccharides based on the moenomycin disaccharide core structure were identified that were bactericidal to Gram-positive bacteria, inhibited cell-wall synthesis in intact cells, and were active on both sensitive and vancomycin-resistant enterococci. These disaccharide analogues do not inhibit the formation of N:-acetylglucosamine-ss-1, 4-MurNAc-pentapeptide-pyrophosphoryl-undecaprenol (lipid II), but do inhibit the polymerization of lipid II into peptidoglycan in Esc. coli. In addition, cell growth was required for bactericidal activity. The data indicate that synthetic disaccharide analogues of moenomycin inhibit cell-wall synthesis at the transglycosylation stage, and that their activity on Gram-positive bacteria differs from moenomycin due to differential targeting of the transglycosylation process. Inhibition of the transglycosylation process represents a promising approach to the design of new antibacterial agents active on drug-resistant bacteria.
TI  - Gene transfer to Clostridium cellulolyticum ATCC 35319.
AB  - Although much is known about the bacterial cellulosome and its various protein components, their contributions to bacterial growth on cellulose and the process of cellulolysis in vivo cannot currently be assessed. To remedy this, the authors have developed gene transfer techniques for Clostridium cellulolyticum ATCC 35319. Firstly, transfer of Tn1545 has been obtained using an Enterococcus faecalis donor. Secondly, IncP-mediated conjugative mobilization of plasmids from Escherichia coli donors has also been achieved. The yield of transconjugants in both cases was low and was probably limited by the suboptimal growth conditions that must of necessity be employed for the co-culture of oligotrophic C. cellulolyticum with copiotrophic donors. A restriction endonuclease was detected in crude extracts of C. cellulolyticum. This enzyme, named CCE:I, is an isoschizomer of MSP:I (HPA:II). Electro-transformation was employed to establish plasmids containing the replication functions of pAMss1 (En. faecalis), pIM13 (Bacillus subtilis), pCB102 (Clostridium butyricum), pIP404 (Clostridium perfringens) and pWV01 (Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris) in C. cellulolyticum. Transformants were only obtained if the DNA was appropriately methylated on the external C of the sequence 5'-CCGG-3' using either BSU:FI methylase in vivo or MSP:I methylase in vitro. Plasmids based on the pAMss1 and pIM13 replicons were more stably maintained than one based on the pCB102 replicon. Selection of transformants on solid medium led to low apparent transformation efficiencies (approx. 10(2) transformants per microg DNA) which might, in part, reflect the low plating efficiency of the organism. Selection of transformants in liquid medium led to a higher apparent yield of transformants (between 10(5) and 10(7) transformants per microg DNA). The methods developed here will pave the way for functional analysis of the various cellulosome components in vivo.
TI  - Carbamate kinase can replace in vivo carbamoyl phosphate synthetase. Implications for the evolution of carbamoyl phosphate biosynthesis.
AB  - The exclusive involvement of carbamate kinase (CK) in fermentative ATP production and of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase (CPS) in the production of carbamoyl phosphate (CP) for pyrimidines and arginine biosynthesis was challenged by the finding of CK as the only activity synthesising CP in the archaea Pyrococcus furiosus and Pyrococcus abyssi. We now show that CK can replace CPS in vivo: transformation of Escherichia coli devoid of the CPS gene with plasmids encoding the CK from P. furiosus or from Enterococcus faecalis (which uses CK for making ATP) restores the ability of CPS-deficient E. coli to grow in the absence of arginine and uracil if ammonia and bicarbonate are present.
TI  - [Antibacterial activities of piperacillin in several fresh clinical isolates].
AB  - We investigated activity of piperacillin (PIPC) in comparison with 8 antibacterial reference drugs against several fresh clinical strains isolated from patients with infectious diseases in the respiratory tract and after surgical interventions in 1999. The following results were obtained: 1. PIPC had its MIC90 of 0.12-6 micrograms/ml in Gram-positive bacteria (Methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis) and showed its MIC of 1 microgram/ml or higher in 9 possible PRSP strains out of 38 isolates of S. pneumoniae but there were no possible isolates with evident resistance in other species of bacteria. 2. PIPC showed favorable antibacterial activities as its MIC90 were 2-8 micrograms/ml in Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter freundii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae), except for P. mirabilis in which its MIC90 was as high as 64 micrograms/ml. 11 out of 39 isolates of P. mirabilis were resistant to other drugs such as PIPC, ABPC, CTM and CZOP. 3. PIPC had its MIC90 of > 128 micrograms/ml in Bacteroides fragilis. From these results, PIPC was considered highly effective in several infections in view of maintaining its favorable antibacterial activities in several causative bacteria even today when 20 years had passed since its first application to clinical practice.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents. Special references to bacteria isolated between April 1997 and March 1998].
AB  - The annual multicenter studies on isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery and their antimicrobial susceptibility have been conducted in 19 facilities in Japan since July 1982. This paper describes the results obtained during the period from April 1997 to March 1998. The number of cases investigated as objectives was 215 for one year. A total of 420 strains (170 strains from primary infections and 250 strains from postoperative infections) were isolated from 174 cases (80.9% of total cases). In primary infections, the isolation rate of anaerobic bacteria was higher than in postoperative infections, while in postoperative infections, those of aerobic Gram-positive bacteria and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were higher than in primary infections. Among aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Enterococcus faecalis was the highest, followed by Staphylococcus aureus, which was frequently isolated from postoperative infections. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, Peptostreptococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp. were commonly isolated from both types of infections. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by P. aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae in this order, and from postoperative infections, P. aeruginosa was most predominantly isolated, followed by E. coli and K. pneumoniae. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Bacteroides fragilis group was the majority of isolates from both types of infections. We found neither vancomycin nor arbekacin resistant strains of S. aureus, and found no vancomycin resistant strains of Enterococcus spp. The susceptibility of P. aeruginosa against carbapenems did not decline in the year 1997, while resistance of B. fragilis group against cephems advanced increasingly.
TI  - Priming by microbial antigens from the intestinal flora determines the ability of CD4+ T cells to rapidly secrete IL-4 in BALB/c mice infected with Leishmania major.
AB  - Infection of BALB/c mice with Leishmania major results in the rapid accumulation  of IL-4 transcripts within CD4(+) T cells that react to the parasite Leishmania homologue of mammalian RACK1 (LACK) Ag. Because memory/effector cells secrete IL-4 more rapidly than naive cells, we sought to analyze the phenotype of these lymphocytes before infection. Indeed, a fraction of LACK-specific CD4(+) T cells expressed a typical CD62 ligand(low)CD44(high)CD45RB(low) phenotype in uninfected mice. LACK-specific T cells were primed in gut-associated lymphoid tissues by cross-reactive microbial Ags as demonstrated by their reactivity with bacterial extracts and by the ability of APCs from the mesenteric LN of BALB/c mice to induce their proliferation. Also, mice in which the digestive tract has been decontaminated exhibited a reduced proportion of LACK-specific T cells expressing a memory/effector phenotype and did not exhibit the early accumulation of IL-4 transcripts induced by L. major. Thus, LACK-specific T cells represent a subset of CD4(+) T cells which have acquired the ability to rapidly secrete IL-4 as the result of their priming by cross-reactive microbial Ags. Tracking the fate of these cells may provide information about the regulation of cell-mediated immune responses to gut Ags in physiological and pathological situations.
TI  - Diversity of domain V of 23S rRNA gene sequence in different Enterococcus species.
AB  - The highly conserved central loop of domain V of 23S RNA (nucleotides 2042 to 2628; Escherichia coli numbering) is implicated in peptidyltransferase activity and represents one of the target sites for macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin B antibiotics. DNA encoding domain V (590 bp) of several species of Enterococcus was amplified by PCR. Twenty enterococcal isolates were tested, including Enterococcus faecium (six isolates), Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus avium, Enterococcus durans, Enterococcus gallinarum, Enterococcus casseliflavus (two isolates of each), and Enterococcus raffinosus, Enterococcus mundtii, Enterococcus malodoratus, and Enterococcus hirae (one isolate of each). For all isolates, species identification by biochemical testing was corroborated by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The sequence of domain V of the 23S rRNA gene from E. faecium and E. faecalis differed from those of all other enterococci. The domain V sequences of E. durans and E. hirae were identical. This was also true for E. gallinarum and E. casseliflavus. E. avium differed from E. casseliflavus by 23 bases, from E. durans by 16 bases, and from E. malodoratus by 2 bases. E. avium differed from E. raffinosus by one base. Despite the fact that domain V is considered to be highly conserved, substantial differences were identified between several enterococcal species.
TI  - Phylogenetic analysis of gram-positive bacteria based on grpE, encoded by the dnaK operon.
AB  - The dnaK operon in gram-positive bacteria includes grpE, dnaJ and, in some members, hrcA as well. Both DnaK and DnaJ have been utilized for constructing phylogenetic relationships among various organisms. Multiple copies exist for dnaK and dnaJ genes in some bacterial genera, as opposed to a single gene copy for grpE and for hrcA, according to the currently available data. Here, we present a partial protein-based phylogenetic tree for gram-positive bacteria, derived by using the amino acid sequence identity of GrpE; the results are compared with the phylogenetic trees generated from 5S rRNA, 16S rRNA, dnaK and dnaJ sequences. Our results indicate three main groupings: two are within low-G+C DNA gram-positive bacteria comprising Bacillus species and Staphylococcus aureus on the one hand and Streptococcus species/Lactococcus lactis/Enterococcus faecalis/Lactobacillus sakei on the other hand; the Mycobacterium species and Streptomyces coelicolor, belonging to the high-G+C DNA gram-positive bacteria, form the third cluster. This hierarchical arrangement is in close agreement with that obtained with 16S rRNA and DnaK sequences but not DnaJ-based phylogeny.
TI  - Occurrence of Salmonella spp in estuarine and coastal waters of Portugal.
AB  - The presence of Salmonella and its relationship with indicator organisms of fecal pollution, such as total coliforms, fecal coliforms and fecal streptococci, was studied at two marine zones in Portugal. Seventeen different Salmonella serotypes were isolated and identified, S. virchow was the most frequently isolated (21.6%). In addition, a high percentage (35.1%) was recorded for some Salmonella serotypes of clinical significance, namely S. enteritidis, S. infantis, S. typhimurium and S. virchow. In any of the samples from the two zones Salmonella was not detected in the absence of any of the indicator organisms. However, the incidence of Salmonella as a function of indicator concentration intervals established by the EEC standards was 0, 10 and 19.3% at guide values of total coliforms, fecal coliforms and fecal streptococci, respectively in the Faro samples (south of Portugal). In contrast, Salmonella incidence rates of 37.5, 36.4 and 33.3% were recorded at the corresponding guide values the Caminha samples (north of Portugal). No significant correlations (p>0.005) were obtained between Salmonella and the indicators at the sampling stations; however, total coliforms and fecal streptococci were the indicators most closely related to Salmonella in Caminha and Faro samples, respectively. Survival experiments in Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis and S. typhimurium, using diffusion chambers, were performed to verify whether the lack of correlation between indicators and Salmonella was due to different inactivation rates in seawater. The results indicate that survival percentages of the three microorganisms tested were similar after 48 h of exposure to seawater.
TI  - Characterization of reutericyclin produced by Lactobacillus reuteri LTH2584.
AB  - Lactobacillus reuteri LTH2584 exhibits antimicrobial activity that can be attributed neither to bacteriocins nor to the production of reuterin or organic acids. We have purified the active compound, named reutericyclin, to homogeneity and characterized its antimicrobial activity. Reutericyclin exhibited a broad inhibitory spectrum including Lactobacillus spp., Bacillus subtilis, B. cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Listeria innocua. It did not affect the growth of gram-negative bacteria; however, the growth of lipopolysaccharide mutant strains of Escherichia coli was inhibited. Reutericyclin exhibited a bactericidal mode of action against Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis, Staphylococcus aureus, and B. subtilis and triggered the lysis of cells of L. sanfranciscensis in a dose-dependent manner. Germination of spores of B. subtilis was inhibited, but the spores remained unaffected under conditions that do not permit germination. The fatty acid supply of the growth media had a strong effect on reutericyclin production and its distribution between producer cells and the culture supernatant. Reutericyclin was purified from cell extracts and culture supernatant of L. reuteri LTH2584 cultures grown in mMRS by solvent extraction, gel filtration, RP-C(8) chromatography, and anion-exchange chromatography, followed by rechromatography by reversed-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography. Reutericyclin was characterized as a negatively charged, highly hydrophobic molecule with a molecular mass of 349 Da. Structural characterization (A. Holtzel, M. G. Ganzle, G. J. Nicholson, W. P. Hammes, and G. Jung, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 39:2766-2768, 2000) revealed that reutericyclin is a novel tetramic acid derivative. The inhibitory activity of culture supernatant of L. reuteri LTH2584 corresponded to that of purified as well as synthetic reutericyclin.
TI  - The LE1 bacteriophage replicates as a plasmid within Leptospira biflexa: construction of an L. biflexa-Escherichia coli shuttle vector.
AB  - We have discovered that LE1, one of the plaque-forming phages previously described as lytic for the Leptospira biflexa saprophytic spirochete (I. Saint Girons, D. Margarita, P. Amouriaux, and G. Baranton, Res. Microbiol. 141:1131-1138, 1990), was indeed temperate. LE1 was found to be unusual, as Southern blot analysis indicated that it is one of the few phages to replicate in the prophage state as a circular plasmid. The unavailability of such small endogenous replicons has hindered genetic experimentation in Leptospira. We have developed a shuttle vector with DNA derived from LE1. Random LE1 DNA fragments were cloned into a pGEM 7Zf(+) derivative devoid of most of the bla gene but carrying a kanamycin resistance marker from the gram-positive bacterium Enterococcus (Streptococcus) faecalis. These constructs were transformed into L. biflexa strain Patoc 1 by electroporation, giving rise to kanamycin-resistant transformants. A 2.2-kb fragment from LE1 was responsible for replication of the vector in L. biflexa. However, a larger region including an intact parA gene homologue was necessary for the stability of the shuttle vector. Direct repeats and AT-rich regions characterized the LE1 origin of replication. Our data indicate that the replicon derived from the LE1 leptophage, together with the kanamycin resistance gene, is a promising tool with which to develop the genetics of Leptospira species.
TI  - Use of oleic acid to reduce the population of the bacterial flora of poultry skin.
AB  - The effect of oleic acid on native bacterial flora of poultry skin was examined.  Skin from commercial broiler carcasses was washed once or twice in solutions of 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, or 10% (wt/vol) oleic acid and rinsed in peptone water. Aerobic bacteria, Enterobacteriaceae, Campylobacter, and enterococci in the rinsates were enumerated. Significantly fewer aerobic bacteria, Enterobacteriaceae, Campylobacter, and enterococci were recovered from rinsates of skin washed in oleic acid than from control samples. Additionally, fewer bacteria were recovered from rinsates of skin washed in higher concentrations of oleic acid than from skin washed in lower concentrations of the fatty acid. In most cases, there was no significant difference in the number of bacteria recovered from rinsates of skin washed once or twice in solutions of oleic acid. Washing skin samples twice in 10% solutions of oleic acid significantly reduced the number of aerobic bacteria, Enterobacteriaceae, Campylobacter, and enterococci that remained attached to the skin. Campylobacter sp., Enterococcus faecalis, and Listeria monocytogenes isolates possessed the least resistance to the antibacterial activity of oleic acid in vitro, while Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa showed higher resistance. Enterobacter cloacae, Staphylococcus lentus, and Salmonella Typhimurium had the greatest resistance to the antibacterial activity of oleic acid. Findings indicate that oleic acid reduces the number of bacteria on the skin of processed broilers and that the fatty acid is bactericidal to several spoilage and pathogenic bacteria associated with poultry.
TI  - Improved vectors for nisin-controlled expression in gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - A set of shuttle vectors, able to replicate in Escherichia coli and in gram-positive bacteria, containing a nisin-inducible promoter (PnisA) and genes encoding NisR and NisK, the two-component signaling mechanism for activating transcription from PnisA in the presence of nisin, was constructed. To test these vectors, Enterococcus faecalis pCF10 plasmid genes prgX, prgY, and prgZ, which respectively encode cytosolic, integral membrane, and cell surface proteins, were cloned downstream of PnisA. Increased protein expression, in the presence of nisin, was demonstrated by Western blot analysis.
TI  - Activity of cecropin P1 and FA-LL-37 against urogenital microflora.
AB  - Two mammalian antimicrobial peptides, FA-LL-37 and cecropin P1, were tested for activity against six uropathogens and five Lactobacillus strains by broth microdilution assay. Both peptides inhibited Escherichia coli at 25 microM (FA-LL-39), and 1.56 microM (cecropin P1), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (12.5 microM, and 25 microM), and Klebsiella pneumoniae, (50 microM, and 1.56 microM), but not Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus epidermidis. FA-LL-37 acted bacteriocidally against E. coli and bacteriostatically against the other two Gram-negative organisms. Cecropin P1 was bacteriocidal to all susceptible bacteria. Lactobacilli were resistant to both peptides, with the exception of poultry isolate Lactobacillus fermentum B-54, which was susceptible to FA-LL-37 at 100 microM. The differential activities of these peptides toward Gram-negative uropathogens versus urogenital lactobacilli demonstrate their potential as a topical treatment for urinary tract infections. In addition, production of such peptides in vivo could be a natural mechanism to aid in the maintenance of the lactobacilli-dominated urogenital flora at the expense of pathogens.
TI  - Ofloxacin-loaded liposomes: in vitro activity and drug accumulation in bacteria.
AB  - Different ofloxacin-loaded unilamellar vesicles were prepared by the extrusion technique, and their antimicrobial activities were determined in comparison to those of the free drug by means of MIC determinations with both American Type Culture Collection standards and wild-type bacterial strains (six strains of Enterococcus faecalis, seven strains of Escherichia coli, six strains of Staphylococcus aureus, and six strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa). The accumulation of ofloxacin and liposome-ofloxacin was measured by determining the amount of the drug inside the bacteria as a function of time. Encapsulated fluoroquinolone yielded MICs which were at least twofold lower than those obtained with the free drug. In particular, liposomes made up of dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine-cholesterol-dipalmitoylphosphatidylser ine and dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine-cholesterol-dihexadecylphosphate (4:3:4 molar ratio) provided the best improvement in antimicrobial activity against the various bacterial strains investigated. The liposome formulation produced higher intracellular fluoroquinolone concentrations than those achieved simultaneously with the free drug in both E. coli and P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Bacteriostatic effects of cerium-humic acid complex: an experimental study.
AB  - The bacteriostatic potency of the cerium-humic acid complex was evaluated by experimental measurement of this complex interaction with E. coli, Bacillus pyocyaneus, Staphylococcus aureus, Leuconostoc and Streptococcus faecalis, and by comparison bacteriostatic effects with the cerium-citrate complex. The experimental results indicated that the cerium-humic acid complex strongly inhibited growth of all five bacterial strains, and its diameter of bacteriostatic circles were more than 30 mm. The minimal bacteria-inhibiting concentration were 1 x 10(-3), 2 x 10(-3) and 1 x 10(-2) mol/L for E. coli and Bacillus pyocyaneus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Leuconostoc and Streptococcus faecalis individually, and the measured minimal bactericidal concentrations were 2 x 10(-3) and 1 x 10(-2) mol/L for Bacillus pyocyaneus, E. coli, and Leuconostoc. To kill Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis, the concentration had to be more than 1 x 10(-20 mol/L. On the contrary, we found that cerium-citrate complex did not inhibit the growth of the above five bacteria, but stimulated bacterial growth. The completely different bacteriostatic results of two cerium complexes may hint that the association and chemical properties of the two complexes were different.
TI  - Characterization of OpuA, a glycine-betaine uptake system of Lactococcus lactis.
AB  - A Lactococcus lactis glycine-betaine transport system was identified by functional complementation of an Escherichia coli proP proU mutant with a gene library from L. lactis sbsp. cremoris. The cloned locus forms an operon highly homologous to opuA, encoding a glycine-betaine uptake system of Bacillus subtilis. Disruption of opuA in L. lactis abolished protection by glycine-betaine against elevated osmolarity. OpuA belongs to the so-called "ABC transporters" family, which comprise an extracellularly localized substrate-binding protein. In B. subtilis OpuA system, this binding protein is a lipoprotein, attached to the external face of the cytoplasmic membrane by its lipidic moiety. In contrast, in the L. lactis opuA operon, and in other gram-positive homologues as well, a fusion between the gene encoding the integral membrane protein and the substrate-binding protein components gave rise to a hybrid protein presumably attaching the substrate-binding protein to the surface of the cell via its covalent link to the integral membrane component. Mapping of L. lactis opuA transcription start identified one mRNA, more abundant in cells grown at elevated osmolarity. Construction of an opuA-gusA fusion confirmed that opuA transcription is directed by a promoter osmotically inducible in L. lactis. When recombined upstream from a lac transcriptional fusion in the chromosome of E. coli, the opuA promoter appeared as very strong, and only poorly stimulated by elevated osmotic pressure, suggesting the existence of a specific machinery involved in the osmotic signal transduction in L. lactis.
TI  - Modeling of Enterococcus faecalis D-alanine:D-alanine ligase: structure-based study of the active site in the wild-type enzyme and in glycopeptide-dependent mutants.
AB  - A model for the 3-D structure of Enterococcus faecalis D-Ala:D-Ala ligase was produced using the X-ray structure of the Escherichia coli enzyme complexed with ADP and the methylphosphinophosphate inhibitor as a template. The model passed critical validation criteria with an accuracy similar to that of the template crystallographic structure and showed that ADP and methylphosphinophosphate were positioned in a large empty pocket at the interface between the central and the C-terminal domains, as in E. coli. It evidenced the residues important for substrate binding and catalytic activity in the active site and demonstrated a large body of conserved interactions between the active sites of the E. faecalis and the E. coli D-Ala:D-Ala ligase, the major differences residing in the balance between the hydrophobic and aromatic environment of the adenine. The model also successfully explained the inactivity of four spontaneous mutants (D295 --> V, which impairs interactions with Mg2+ and R293, which are both essential for binding and catalytic activity; S319 --> I, which perturbs recognition of D-Ala2; DAK251-253 --> E, in which the backbone conformation in the vicinity of the deletion remains unaltered but phosphate transfer from ATP is perturbed because of lack of K253; T316 --> I, which causes the loss of a hydrogen bond affecting the positioning of S319 and therefore the binding of D-Ala2). Since D-Ala:D-Ala ligase is an essential enzyme for bacteria, this approach, combining molecular modeling and molecular biology, may help in the design of specific ligands which could inhibit the enzyme and serve as novel antibiotics.
TI  - [The primary screening of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli strains to develop effective probiotic preparations based on them].
AB  - 10 Bifidobacterium strains and 10 Lactobacillus strains were studied for their antagonistic activity with respect to Escherichia coli, Klebsiella ozaenae, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and for their sensitivity to antibiotics, widely used in clinical practice. L. acidophilus strain 5/4, L. acidophilus strain 18/4, B. adolescentis strain UX, B. longum strain 44 exhibited the highest antagonistic activity and the highest degree of antibiotic resistance. The restriction analysis of the chromosomal DNA of these strains was then made and their plasmid content was studied, making it possible to recognize these strains in future in the course of in vivo experiments.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (1998). II. Background of patients].
AB  - Clinical background was investigated on 449 patients with urinary tract infections (UTIs) from whom 591 bacterial strains were isolated in 9 hospitals during the period from June, 1998 through May, 1999. About distribution of age and sex of patients and type of infections, among males, patients less than 50 years old were few, and uncomplicated UTIs without indwelling catheters was most frequent. Among females, patients less than 20 years old were few, and uncomplicated was most frequent. Escherichia coli was the most frequently isolated in uncomplicated UTIs, and the higher the ages of patients, the higher were became the isolation frequencies of Enterococcus faecalis, Proteus spp. and Klebsiella spp. In complicated UTIs with indwelling catheters and without indwelling catheters, the types of pathogens had no relation with ages. The complication of infections had decreased E. coli but that had increased Proteus spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. Until last year, use of antibiotics had decreased pathogens isolated from patients with uncomplicated UTIs drastically in our study. But, pathogens isolated after antibiotics had increased in 1998. As for surgical procedures and types of causative organisms in UTIs, E. faecalis were more isolated when surgical procedures were experienced, and E. coli were more isolated when they were not in uncomplicated and complicated UTIs without indwelling catheters. In complicated UTIs with indwelling catheters, types of causative organisms had no relationship with surgical procedures.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (1998). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The frequencies of bacterial isolation and susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents were investigated on 538 bacterial strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 9 hospitals during the period of June 1998 to May 1999. Of the above bacterial isolates, Gram-positive bacteria accounted for 30.3% and Gram-negative bacteria accounted for 69.7%. Susceptibilities of several isolated bacteria to antimicrobial agents were as follows; against Enterococcus faecalis isolated from patients with UTIs, vancomycin (VCM), ampicillin (ABPC) and imipenem (IPM) had strong activities. Among E. faecalis strains, those with low susceptibilities to all drugs have increased in 1998, compared with those in 1997. VCM showed the highest activity against MRSA isolated from patients with UTIs. The MICs of VCM for all 34 strains were equal to or lower than 2 micrograms/ml. Arbekacin (ABK) was also active against MRSA with the MIC90s of 2 micrograms/ml. Against Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, all drugs except penicillins were active. Particularly, meropenem (MEPM) showed the highest activity with the MICs of 0.125 micrograms/ml or below. Almost all the drugs except minocycline (MINO) showed high activities against Proteus mirabilis. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, all drugs were not so active, with the MIC90s of 16 micrograms/ml or above. MEPM, IPM and gentamicin (GM) showed high activities against Serratia marcescens. Generally, it seemed that resistant strains of S. marcescens had decreased since 1996.
TI  - A new rapid automated method for the detection of Listeria from environmental swabs and sponges.
AB  - Many food and meat processors test environmental swabs and sponges to confirm the absence of Listeria spp. Spectral pattern changes in a liquid growth medium, resulting from esculin hydrolysis by Listeria in contaminated swabs and sponges, were automatically monitored by the BioSys instrument in a semifluid layer (SFL). The blackening of SFL in modified MOX broth resulted in sharply declining curves, which were easily detected by the instrument. The instrument detected all nine strains of Listeria monocytogenes tested. None of the gram negative organisms (Proteus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas, Citrobacter and Yersinia) were detected by the system, nor were most gram positive organisms, including Bacillus, Streptococcus, and Lactobacillus strains, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecium and E. faecalis, which hydrolyze esculin, produced black colonies on PALCAM and Oxford media and were also detected in the system. A total of 122 sponges and swabs collected at food processing plants were evaluated by this method. Of these, 99 were negative, and 11 were positive. L. innocua was the dominant Listeria species in these environmental samples. Good correlation was obtained between numbers of Listeria and detection times of esculin hydrolysis: 1000 CFU/swab were detected in 10-13 h, whereas 1-10 CFU/swab were detected in less than 22 h. The total assay time was 26 h.
TI  - Selective inhibition of bacterial dihydroorotate dehydrogenases by thiadiazolidinediones.
AB  - Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase is a critical enzyme of de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Differences in the primary structure of the enzymes from Gram-positive and -negative bacteria and from mammals indicate significant structural divergence among these enzymes. We have identified a class of small molecules, the thiadiazolidinediones, that inhibit prototypical enzymes from Gram-positive and -negative bacteria, but are inactive against the human enzyme. The most potent compound in our collection functioned as a time-dependent irreversible inactivator of the bacterial enzymes with k(inact)/K(i) values of 48 and 500 M(-1) sec(-1) for the enzymes from Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis, respectively. The data presented here indicate that it is possible to inhibit prokaryotic dihydroorotate dehydrogenases selectively while sparing the mammalian enzyme. Thus, this enzyme may represent a valuable target for the development of novel antibiotic compounds.
TI  - [The vaginal Bifidobacterium flora in women of reproductive age].
AB  - The composition of vaginal bifidoflora in 56 clinically healthy women of reproductive age was studied. The study revealed that four species of bifidobacteria, viz. Bifidobacterium bifidum, B. breve, B. adolescentis 2 and B. longum, dominated in the composition of this bifidobacterial population. Nine out of 11 isolated strains were found to be capable of inhibiting indicator microorganisms Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis when tested in vitro; in addition, strains B. adolescentis 2 F1, B. bifidum G1, B. breve P2 and B. longum Z4 inhibited Klebsiella ozaenae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and were also active acid producers. Three of these 4 bifidobacterial strains were capable of adhesion to vaginal epitheliocytes, while B. bifidum G1 was practically incapable of adherence to these cells, similarly to B. bifidum strain 791 of intestinal origin. In addition, the spectra of antibiotic susceptibility varied from strain to strain, but all bifidobacterial strains were susceptible to benzylpenicillin and resistant to lomefloxacin, most of them being also resistant to cyprofloxacin and gentamicin. Thus the data presented in this work are indicative of the possibility and advantages of using bifidobacterial strains belonging to this ecological niche as probiotics for the correction of the microflora of the urogenital tract in females.
TI  - [The antagonistic activity of bifidobacteria in vitro and in vivo studied by using gnotobiological technology].
AB  - The antagonistic activity of 4 strains of bifidobacteria (B. adolescentis 2 F1, B. longum Z4, B. breve R2 and B. bifidum G1), isolated from the vagina of healthy females of the reproductive age, with respect to Escherichia coli, Klebsiella ozaenae, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Gardnerella vaginalis were studied in vitro and in vivo. The in vitro experiments revealed that all above-mentioned bifidobacteria were capable of inhibiting the growth of all indicator bacterial strains. Still of all the bifidobacteria under study had different levels of activity. B. adolescentis strain 2 F1 exhibited the highest inhibiting activity in vitro. In contrast to in vitro experiments, in vivo experiments with B. breve R2 demonstrated its high antagonistic activity with respect to E. coli. The data thus obtained indicate that in the study of antagonistic activity the use of the in vivo model as also expedient, for it is mainly in vivo that probiotic preparations show their activity.
TI  - Enterococcus faecalis V583 contains a cytochrome bd-type respiratory oxidase.
AB  - We have cloned an Enterococcus faecalis gene cluster, cydABCD, which when expressed in Bacillus subtilis results in a functional cytochrome bd terminal oxidase. Our results indicate that E. faecalis V583 cells have the capacity of aerobic respiration when grown in the presence of heme.
TI  - Use of PCR with universal primers and restriction endonuclease digestions for detection and identification of common bacterial pathogens in cerebrospinal fluid.
AB  - We have designed a universal PCR capable of amplifying a portion of the 16S rRNA  gene of eubacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Legionella pneumophila, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis. The sizes of the amplified products from various bacteria were the same (996 bp), but the restriction patterns of most PCR products generated by HaeIII digestion were different. PCR products from S. aureus and S. epidermidis could not be digested by HaeIII but yielded different patterns when they were digested with MnlI. PCR products from S. pneumoniae, E. faecium, and E. faecalis yielded the same HaeIII digestion pattern but could be differentiated by AluI digestion. PCR products from E. coli, K. pneumoniae, S. marcescens, and E. cloacae also had the same HaeIII digestion pattern but had different patterns when digested with DdeI or BstBI. This universal PCR could detect as few as 10 E. coli or 250 S. aureus organisms. Compared with culture, the sensitivity of this universal PCR for detection and identification of bacteria directly from 150 cerebrospinal fluids was 92.3%. These results suggest that this universal PCR coupled with restriction enzyme analysis can be used to detect and identify bacterial pathogens in clinical specimens.
TI  - Purification, characterization, and primary structure of a novel cell wall hydrolytic amidase, CwhA, from Achromobacter lyticus.
AB  - A novel bacteriolytic enzyme CwhA (cell wall hydrolytic amidase) was purified by  ion exchange and gel-filtration chromatographies from a commercial bacteriolytic preparation from Achromobacter lyticus. CwhA exhibited optimal pH at 8.5 and lysed CHCl(3)-treated Escherichia coli more efficiently than Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Pediococcus acidilactici. The enzyme was inhibited by 1,10-phenanthroline strongly and by EDTA to a lesser extent, suggesting that it is probably a metalloenzyme. Amino acid composition and mass spectrometric analyses for the CwhA-derived M. luteus muropeptides revealed that CwhA is N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase [EC 3.5.1. 28]. The complete amino acid sequence of CwhA was established by a combination of Edman degradation and mass spectrometry for peptides obtained by Achromobacter protease I (API) digestion and cyanogen bromide (CNBr) cleavage. The enzyme consists of a single polypeptide chain of 177 amino acid residues with one disulfide bond, Cys114-Cys121. CwhA was found to be homologous to N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase from bacteriophage T7 (BPT7). Its sequence identity with BPT7 is 35%, but the amino acid residues functioning as zinc ligands in BPT7 are absent in CwhA. These results suggest that CwhA is a new type of N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase.
TI  - In vitro activity of gemifloxacin against a broad range of recent clinical isolates from the USA.
AB  - The antibacterial potencies of gemifloxacin (SB-265805) and 13 comparator compounds were determined by broth microdilution against a panel of 645 Gram-positive and 995 Gram-negative organisms collected from various USA sites. Time-kill studies were performed and postantibiotic effect (PAE) was determined for several organisms using trovafloxacin and ciprofloxacin as comparator compounds. Based on MIC(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent compound tested against Gram-positive isolates: Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC(90) 0. 016 mg/L), Streptococcus agalactiae (0.03 mg/L), Streptococcus pyogenes (0.03 mg/L), viridans streptococci (0.12 mg/L), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (0.03 mg/L), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2 mg/L), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (0. 016 mg/L) and Enterococcus faecalis (2 mg/L). Against Gram-negative isolates, the potency of gemifloxacin was equal to that of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin and generally better than that of ofloxacin, grepafloxacin, trovafloxacin and nalidixic acid. MIC(90)s for gemifloxacin were: Haemophilus influenzae (</=0.008 mg/L), Moraxella catarrhalis (0.008 mg/L), Escherichia coli (0.016 mg/L), Klebsiella pneumoniae (0.25 mg/L), Klebsiella oxytoca (0.25 mg/L), Enterobacter cloacae (1 mg/L), Enterobacter aerogenes (0.25 mg/L), Proteus spp. (4 mg/L), Serratia spp. (1 mg/L), Citrobacter freundii (2 mg/L), Morganella morganii (0.12 mg/L), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8 mg/L), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4 mg/L) and Acinetobacter spp. (32 mg/L). Gemifloxacin was bactericidal for all organisms studied at 2 and 4 x MIC. The PAE for most strains was in the range 0.7-2.5 h at 2 and 4 x MIC, although longer PAEs were observed with H. influenzae, P. aeruginosa and Proteus vulgaris (>6 h at 4 x MIC) and shorter PAEs with E. faecalis (0.1-0.6 h) and K. pneumoniae (0.1-0.2 h). In conclusion, gemifloxacin is a novel quinolone with a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity. It has substantially improved potency against Gram-positive organisms, especially streptococci, for which gemifloxacin is generally at least eight- to 16-fold more potent than other quinolones tested. It retains the good Gram-negative activity seen with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and shows good bactericidal activity and prolonged PAEs.
TI  - [Frequency and antibiotic susceptibility of urinary pathogens isolated in the microbiology and virology laboratory of the Careggi General Hospital in the period July-December 1996].
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to evaluate the isolation frequency and antibiotic susceptibility of pathogens isolated form urinocoltures. METHODS: 2192 bacterial strains obtained from urine cultures with bacterial count > 100,000 UFC/ml were examined in our Laboratory from July through December 1996. Inpatients as well as outpatients were considered. Five different ward typologies were taken into account (Surgery, Medicine, Obstetrics, Spinal Unit and High Risk Wards). Isolation frequencies were evaluated for each ward, but in order to get an adequate statistical sample they were divided into in two categories, e.g. strains isolated from inpatients and from outpatients. Antibiotic susceptibility was also evaluated dividing the data into the same two categories. For strains isolated with lower frequencies that was not possible, and data from inpatients were grouped with data from outpatients. RESULTS: The results obtained show that bacterial species most frequently isolated among inpatients are Escherichia coli (45.7%), Enterococcus faecalis (16.8%), Proteus mirabilis (9.1%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6.9%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (6.4%). Those most frequently isolated among outpatients are Escherichia coli (58.1%), Enterococcus faecalis (12.3%), Proteus mirabilis (9.1%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (4.4%) and Coagulase negative staphylococci (4.0%). As far as antibiotic susceptibility is concerned, whenever a statistically significant difference in sensitivity could be observed between strains isolated from inpatients and strains isolated from outpatients, sensitivity was always higher for outpatients strains. CONCLUSIONS: Isolation frequency and antibiotic susceptibility are different depending on the place of origin of the patients (inpatients/outpatients). This implies a different approach to the empiric therapy in urinary tract infections.
TI  - [Well water pollution in the Khombole district: research on the contamination by  organochlorine pesticide residues and organic substances (feces)].
AB  - The study realized in the district of Khombole (SENEGAL) has permit to estimate the contamination levels of wells waters used by the populations. The research and the dosage of the organichlorine pesticide residues, nitrites and nitrates and microbiologic analysis have been done on 19 wells chosen after a drawning of lots. The organochlorine pesticide residues which have been found prove that the wells are permanently exposed to these chemical substances which don't constitute nevertheless a major risk for the populations health. The results of our research proved also that there is a real risk of intoxication with the nitrogen oxides. In effects more than 50% of the wells have revealed nitrates contents up to the indicative value (25 mg/l). As for the nitrates, with a few exceptions (5/18), the contents are superior to the authorized norm (0.1 mg/l). By another way the bacteriologic analysis has revealed in the one hand a DBT (Total Bacterian Count) up to 10,000 germs/l for all the wells, and in the other hand the presence of Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis that confirm a faecal contamination.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of gatifloxacin against 873 clinical isolates from respiratory tract, urinary tract and surgical infections during 1997-1998 in Japan.
AB  - The in vitro activity of gatifloxacin was determined for 873 isolates from various infections during 1997-1998 in Japan. Gatifloxacin was active against streptococci, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, with MIC(90)s of </=0.39 mg/L. The activity was two- to 32-fold greater than that of ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin against Gram-positive bacteria, and comparable to that against Gram-negative bacteria. Gatifloxacin was more active than the other quinolones against quinolone-resistant staphylococci, Enterococcus faecalis, E. coli and Enterobacter cloacae. It also had good activity against penicillin- or macrolide-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae and ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae.
TI  - [A probiotic as an antagonist of bacterial translocation in experimental pancreatitis].
AB  - Infection is the most common cause of death in acute pancreatitis. Earlier studies have demonstrated that early enteral nutrition decreases microbial translocation, upregulates the immune function and reduces septic complications and mortality. Lactobacillus plantarum (Lp) has been shown to be effective in reducing egress of endotoxin and microbial strain that showed very high adherence power to gut mucosa. We adopted a model of acute pancreatitis induced by isolation and ligation of biliopancreatic duct in adult Lewis rats. Three groups were studied: A. control group (sham operation); B. induced pancreatitis, no further treatment; C. Induced pancreatitis + gavage with 5 ml/day of a suspension of Lp 299 v in a dose of 0.5-1.0 x 10(9)/ml during 4 days before and 4 days after induction of pancreatitis. All animals were sacrificed after 96 hours. Histological studies and microbiological analyses were performed. Forty out of 55 animals showed signs of severe pancreatitis on sacrifice after 96 hours. Only these animals were further studied. In group A, we found only 1/20 bacteria in mesenteric nodes (MN). Pathogenic microrganisms were found in the non-treated group in MN in 14/20 and in the pancreatic tissue in 10/20. In contrast, when kept on an umbrella of Lp 299 v, only 4/20 animals demonstrated growth of enteric bacteria in MN and 3/20 in pancreatic tissue. All of these results showed a significant reduction of infection in the treated groups. In our model, Lp 299 v is effective in preventing microbial translocation in experimental pancreatitis. Treatment with probiotic bacteria, such as Lactobacillus spp, seems to be a promising alternative as problems with antibiotic-resistant bacteria seem to accumulate.
TI  - Treatment of sanitary-important bacteria by bacteriocin substance V24 in cattle dung water.
AB  - Quantification of sanitary-important bacteria (e.g. Enterobacteriaceae), as well  as indicators of environmental contamination, was assessed in samples of cattle dung from 25 cattle farms in 15 north-eastern Slovakia districts. The inhibitory effect of crude bacteriocin extract CBE V24 from Enterococcus faecalis V24 against Listeria monocytogenes Ohio and Yersinia enterocolitica YE85 was examined in cattle dung water with the aim of finding a new way of eliminating the health risk of the animal slurry. The following bacterial groups were quantified: Salmonella spp., Shigella-like spp. , Proteus spp., Enterobacter spp., Citrobacter spp., Pseudomonas spp. , Escherichia coli, Listeria spp., staphylococci, streptococci and enterococci (the average count ranged from 102 up to 104 cfu ml-1). Antagonistic effect of the crude bacteriocin from Enterococcus faecalis V24 in the range of 100-600 Arbitrary units per ml (AU ml-1) was shown against the following bacteria: Enterobacter cloacae, Ent. asburiae, Proteus spp., Salmonella spp., Acinetobacter lwoffi, L. monocytogenes as well as Y. enterocolitica YE85. During tests performed to study the inhibitory effect of the crude bacteriocin CBE V24 (concentration 800, 1600 AU ml-1) against L. monocytogenes Ohio and Y. enterocolitica YE85 in experimentally contaminated cattle dung, a reduction of 2.03 and 1.44 log cfu ml-1, respectively, was already noted after 1 h after crude bacteriocin CBE V24 addition.
TI  - Cloning, sequencing and characterization of the ccpA gene from Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - Enzymes involved in the metabolism of complex carbon and energy sources are unnecessary under conditions of abundant, readily metabolisable nutrients such as glucose or fructose. The repression of these enzymes by glucose has been termed carbon catabolite repression. Mechanisms involved in the carbon catabolite repression in gram-positive bacteria are known to differ from those of gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli. It appears to be mediated by transcriptional repression, requiring trans-acting CcpA, a member of the LacI-GalR family of bacterial regulatory proteins and a cis-acting consensus sequence, designated cre. Here, we report the cloning and characterisation of the chromosomal ccpA gene from Enterococcus faecalis JH2-2. This gene is predicted to encode a 333 amino acids protein with nearly 75% identity to CcpA of Lactobacillus casei.
TI  - Identification of general stress genes in Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - The susceptibility and the acquisition of tolerance of E. faecalis ATCC 19433 to  heat, ethanol, bile salts, NaCl, H2O2 and pH shifts were determined. During exposure to these environmental stresses, protein synthesis analysed by 2-D electrophoresis revealed 167 stress proteins. Six stress protein were found to be induced by at least six of the eight treatments and considered to be general stress proteins (Gsp). Western blotting identified two of these Gsp as DnaK and GroEL. Analysis of the four other Gsp revealed that at least two of them were not previously described.
TI  - Butyrolactones from Aspergillus terreus.
AB  - In the process development of lovastatin using Aspergillus terreus DRCC 152 in solid state fermentation, we have isolated a new butyrolactone-IV (3) along with the previously reported butyrolactone-I (1) and butyrolactone-II (2) produced under submerged conditions. The structure of compound 3 has been characterized as 3-hydroxy-5-[2-(1-hydroxy-1-methylethyl)-2(R)-2,3-dihydro-benzo[b]furan- 5 ylmethyl]-4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-5-methoxycarbonyl-(5R)-2,5-dihydro-2 -furanone on the basis of spectroscopic studies. The absolute stereochemistry has been determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction studies. The cytotoxic and antibacterial activities of these compounds were determined.
TI  - A second dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (Type A) of the human pathogen Enterococcus faecalis: expression, purification, and steady-state kinetic mechanism.
AB  - We report the identification, expression, and characterization of a second Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODase A) from the human pathogen Enterococcus faecalis. The enzyme consists of a polypeptide chain of 322 amino acids that shares 68% identity with the cognate type A enzyme from the bacterium Lactococcus lactis. E. faecalis DHODase A catalyzed the oxidation of l-dihydroorotate while reducing a number of substrates, including fumarate, coenzyme Q(0), and menadione. The steady-state kinetic mechanism has been determined with menadione as an oxidizing substrate at pH 7.5. Initial velocity and product inhibition data suggest that the enzyme follows a two-site nonclassical ping-pong kinetic mechanism. The absorbance of the active site FMN cofactor is quenched in a concentration-dependent manner by titration with orotate and barbituric acid, two competitive inhibitors with respect to dihydroorotate. In contrast, titration of the enzyme with menadione had no effect on FMN absorbance, consistent with nonoverlapping binding sites for dihyroorotate and menadione, as suggested from the kinetic mechanism. The reductive half-reaction has been shown to be only partially rate limiting, and an attempt to evaluate the slow step in the overall reaction has been made by simulating orotate production under steady-state conditions. Our data indicate that the oxidative half-reaction is a rate-limiting segment, while orotate, most likely, retains significant affinity for the reduced enzyme, as suggested by the product inhibition pattern.
TI  - Effects of Enterococcus faecalis fsr genes on production of gelatinase and a serine protease and virulence.
AB  - Three agr-like genes (fsrA, fsrB, and fsrC, for Enterococcus faecalis regulator)  were found upstream of the previously reported gelatinase gene (gelE) and a downstream putative serine protease gene (sprE; accession number Z12296) of Enterococcus faecalis OG1RF. The deduced amino acid sequence of fsrA shows 26% identity and 38% similarity to Staphylococcus aureus AgrA (the response regulator of the accessory gene regulator system in the agr locus), FsrB shows 23% identity and 41% similarity to S. aureus AgrB, and FsrC shows 23% identity and 36% similarity to S. aureus AgrC (the sensor transducer of Agr system). Northern blot analysis suggested that gelE and sprE are cotranscribed and that fsrB and fsrC are also cotranscribed in OG1RF. Northern blot analysis of fsrA, fsrB, fsrC, gelE, and sprE insertion mutants showed that fsrB, fsrC, gelE, and sprE are not expressed in fsrA, fsrB, and fsrC mutants, while insertion in an open reading frame further upstream of fsrA did not effect the expression of these genes, suggesting that agr-like genes may be autoregulated and that they regulate gelE and sprE expression, as further confirmed by complementation of fsr gene mutations with a 6-kb fragment which contains all three fsr genes in the shuttle vector, pAT18. Testing of 95 other isolates of E. faecalis showed that 62% produced gelatinase (Gel(+)), while 91% (including all Gel(+) strains) hybridized to a gelE probe; 71% (including all Gel(+) strains) hybridized to an fsr probe, corroborating the conclusion that both gelE and fsr are necessary for gelatinase production. Testing of fsrA, fsrB, and sprE mutants in a mouse peritonitis model showed that sprE and agr-like gene mutants resulted in highly significantly prolonged survival compared to the parent strain OG1RF, a finding similar to what we had previously shown for a gelE mutant. These results suggest that sprE and agr-like genes contribute to the virulence of E. faecalis OG1RF in this model.
TI  - Paradoxical effect of inserting, in Enterococcus faecalis penicillin-binding protein 5, an amino acid box responsible for low affinity for penicillin in Enterococcus faecium.
AB  - Penicillin-binding proteins 5 (PBP5s) of enterococci are structurally and immunologically related proteins that are characterized by their low affinity for penicillin. For this reason, they are mainly involved in penicillin resistance, due essentially to their ability to take over the function of all other PBPs already bound and inhibited by the beta-lactam. It has been demonstrated that penicillin resistance in enterococci is acquired either by overproduction of PBP5 or by the presence of specific amino acid sequences in the protein that further decrease the affinity for penicillin. In particular, a specific amino acid box (ANNGA) previously identified in Enterococcus faecium is responsible for the high penicillin resistance displayed by this species. Here, we describe the insertion of the PBP5 amino acid box ANNGA in Enterococcus faecalis, an enterococcal species usually more sensitive to penicillin, by site-directed mutagenesis. Mutagenized PBP5 was re-introduced into a pbp5 mutant of E. faecalis obtained by insertion of transposon Tn916. Data indicate that this amino acid box brings about no reduction in penicillin sensitivity in the recipient E. faecalis strain, but, paradoxically, dramatically lowers the penicillin minimal inhibitory concentration caused by the native PBP5. We deduce that, although enterococcal PBP5s are a family of closely related proteins as far as biological function is concerned, differences exist in their three-dimensional structure that affect penicillin affinity.
TI  - [Advantages and disadvantages in the use of central venous catheters in children  with malignant diseases].
AB  - The authors report the problem of central venous catheter appliance to the children with malignant diseases, employed for the first time in Bosnia and Herzegovina with the aim of pediatric oncologic patients treatment. During 1997 central venous catheter type Hickman was used in nine children between two and half to eleven years old (average six years and one months). The average time of catheter placement was six months, in two cases catheter were eliminated after two and three months respectively since application (spontaneous elimination and repeated septic attacks, caused bu resistant bacterial strains). Gram-positive bacteria have been isolated with eight children (Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis), and gram-negative enterobacteriaceae (Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella oxytocia and pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Salmonella group C and Enterococcus faecalis) in samples taken from the catheter and hemoculture. The central venous catheter is useful in treating oncological patients, but may cause serious consequences, like local infections or septicaemia.
TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial activity of peptide deformylase inhibitors.
AB  - Peptide deformylase catalyzes the removal of the N-terminal formyl group from newly synthesized polypeptides in eubacteria. Its essential character in bacterial cells makes it an attractive target for antibacterial drug design. In this work, we have rationally designed and synthesized a series of peptide thiols that act as potent, reversible inhibitors of purified recombinant peptide deformylase from Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis. The most potent inhibitor has a K(I) value of 11 nM toward the B. subtilis enzyme. These inhibitors showed antibacterial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, with minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) as low as 5 microM ( approximately 2 microg/mL). The PDF inhibitors induce bacterial cell lysis and are bactericidal toward all four bacterial strains that have been tested, B. subtilis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, and E. coli. Resistance evaluation of one of the inhibitors (1b) against B. subtilis showed that no resistant clone could be found from >1 x 10(9) cells. Quantitative analysis using a set of inhibitors designed to possess varying potencies against the deformylase enzyme revealed a linear correlation between the MIC values and the K(I) values. These results suggest that peptide deformylase is the likely molecular target responsible for the antibacterial activity of these inhibitors and is therefore a viable target for antibacterial drug design.
TI  - The gene encoding IIAB(Man)L in Streptococcus salivarius is part of a tetracistronic operon encoding a phosphoenolpyruvate: mannose/glucose phosphotransferase system.
AB  - Glucose and mannose are transported in streptococci by the mannose-PTS (phosphoenolpyruvate:mannose phosphotransferase system), which consists of a cytoplasmic IIAB protein, called IIAB(Man), and an uncharacterized membrane permease. This paper reports the characterization of the man operon encoding the specific components of the mannose-PTS of Streptococcus salivarius. The man operon was composed of four genes, manL, manM, manN and manO. These genes were transcribed from a canonical promoter (Pman) into a 3.6 kb polycistronic mRNA that contained a 5'-UTR (untranslated region). The predicted manL gene product encoded a 35.5 kDa protein and contained the amino acid sequences of the IIA and IIB phosphorylation sites already determined from purified S. salivarius IIAB(Man)L. Expression of manL in Escherichia coli generated a 35 kDa protein that reacted with anti-IIAB(Man)L antibodies. The predicted ManM protein had an estimated size of 27.2 kDa. ManM had similarity with IIC domains of the mannose-EII family, but did not possess the signature proposed for mannose-IIC proteins from Gram-negative bacteria. From multiple alignment analyses of sequences available in current databases, the following modified IIC(Man) signature is proposed: GX3G[DNH]X3G[LIVM]2XG2[STL][LT][EQ]. The deduced product of manN was a hydrophobic protein with a predicted molecular mass of 33.4 kDa. The ManN protein contained an amino acid sequence similar to the signature sequence of the IID domains of the mannose-EII family. manO encoded a 13.7 kDa protein. This gene was also transcribed as a monocistronic mRNA from a promoter located in the manN-manO intergenic region. A search of current databases revealed the presence of IIAB(Man)L, ManM, ManN and ManO orthologues in Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Enterococcus faecalis. This work has elucidated the molecular structure of the mannose PTS in streptococci and enterococci, and demonstrated the presence of a putative regulatory protein (ManO) within the man operon.
TI  - Morphologic changes correlating to different sensitivities of Escherichia coli and enterococcus faecalis to Nd:YAG laser irradiation through dentin.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Previous studies demonstrated the disinfecting potential of Nd:YAG laser irradiation on the root canal system from an overall quantitative viewpoint. The aim of this study was to evaluate the specific effect of irradiation through dentin on gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria with regard to their cell structure. STUDY DESIGN/MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sterile dentin samples of standardized size were divided into two sets of four groups with eight samples each. The first set was inoculated with Escherichia coli as the gram-negative test strain, the second set was inoculated with Enterococcus faecalis, which served as the gram-positive test organism. The samples were then irradiated on the bacteria-free side in contact mode under constant scanning movement at an angle of 10 degrees by use of the fiber optic of the Nd:YAG laser. Upon laser treatment they were critical point dried and subjected to SEM investigation. Another two sets of samples were prepared and irradiated in the same manner and evaluated by standard microbiological procedures to verify whether the observed morphologic alterations correlated to cell death. RESULTS: SEM investigations revealed damage pattens that increased with the amount of energy applied. Whereas the gram-negative test organism showed immediate structural injury, the gram-positive test organism required repeated application of irradiation. The microbiological examination showed reduction of both bacterial strains, yet to different extents. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates the different morphologic impact of Nd:YAG laser irradiation through dentin on representatives of the two main groups of bacteria. It shows that the construction of the cell wall is crucial for their individual sensitivity to laser treatment.
TI  - Three-year surveillance study of nosocomial bacterial resistance in Argentina. The Antimicrobial Committee; and the National Surveillance Program (SIR) Participants Group.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: A national surveillance program (SIR) was introduced in 1996 in Argentina by the Antimicrobial Committee of the Argentinean Society for Microbiology to assess bacterial resistance. The present study reports the rates of nosocomial bacterial resistance found by this program. METHODS: A 2-month point-prevalence study was conducted twice yearly (i.e., April-May and October-November) from 1996 to 1998, by 27 Argentinean centers. Susceptibility testing was carried out by the disk diffusion method following the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards guidelines. RESULTS: In all, 6343 isolates recovered from 5603 inpatients (> or =48-hr hospitalization) were included. Methicillin resistance was 58% and 56% in Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), respectively. Although no vancomycin resistance was found in staphylococci, 2% and 8% of the S. aureus and CNS strains, respectively, proved resistant to teicoplanin. No ampicillin resistance was displayed by Enterococcus faecalis. High-level gentamicin and streptomycin resistance in enterococci were 33% and 37%, respectively. Acquired glycopeptide resistance in enterococci emerged in 1997 (2%). Imipenem resistance in Acinetobacter spp and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was 9% and 21%, respectively. Among Enterobacteriaceae, 1% and 5% of the Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae isolates, respectively, proved resistant to imipenem. Ceftazidime and cefepime resistance was found in 63% and 33% of the E. cloacae strains. Resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins was shown by 48%, 26%, and 8% of the K. pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Escherichia coli isolates, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The alarming rates of resistance found in this study provide compelling evidence of the need for more rational use of antimicrobial agents in Argentina.
TI  - Enterocin 012, a bacteriocin produced by Enterococcus gallinarum isolated from the intestinal tract of ostrich.
AB  - Enterococcus gallinarum strain 012, isolated from the duodenum of ostrich, produced enterocin 012 which is active against Ent. faecalis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lact. sake, Listeria innocua, Propionibacterium acidipropionici, Propionibacterium sp., Clostridium perfringens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella typhimurium. One of the four pathogenic strains of Escherichia coli isolated from the intestinal tract of ostrich was inhibited by enterocin 012. No antimicrobial activity was recorded against Bacillus cereus, Cl. sporogenes, Cl. tyrobutyricum, Leuconostoc cremoris, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Staphylococcus carnosus and Streptococcus thermophilus. Enterocin 012 was resistant to treatment with lysozyme, catalase, lipase and papain, but sensitive to Proteinase K, alpha-chymotrypsin, trypsin and pepsin. Treatment of enterocin 012 with gastric juice from the duodenum resulted in a 50% loss of antibacterial activity. Half of the activity was lost when incubated at 80 degrees C for 30 min, or when kept overnight at a pH of 1.0-5.0 and pH 11.0 and 12.0, respectively. Enterocin 012 production started in mid-logarithmic growth and reached a maximum of 800 AU ml-1, but increased further to 1600 AU ml-1 in the stationary growth phase. The peptide is approximately 3.4 kDa in size, as determined after partial purification with Amberlite XAD-1180 and ammonium sulphate precipitation, followed by tricine-sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The mechanism of antimicrobial activity against Lact. sake LMG 13558 is bactericidal and caused cell lysis of active growing cells.
TI  - Ciprofloxacin in the treatment of chronic bacterial prostatitis: a prospective, non-comparative multicentre clinical trial with long-term follow-up. The German Prostatitis Study Group.
AB  - The efficacy and safety of ciprofloxacin 500 mg bd for 28 days were assessed in 65 adult males with symptomatic bacterial prostatitis, from eight centres in Germany. Urine and prostatic secretions were obtained for culture. Clinical signs and symptoms were evaluated at 12-18 days during treatment, end of treatment (4-9 days post-treatment), and 1, 3, 6 and 9 months post-treatment. Safety was monitored during and at the end of treatment. E. coli was the most frequent pathogen causing infection (35/62) and Enterococcus faecalis the second most frequent (13/62). The combined bacteriological response by patient determined at return visits 4-9 days post and 1 month post-treatment, respectively, was eradication 48/54 (88.9%), persistence 3/54 (5.6%), eradication with recurrence 1/54 (1.9%) and eradication with reinfection 2/54 (3.7%). The clinical response at 1 month post-treatment was resolution 53/54 (98. 1%) and 1/54 (1.9%) failure. The rates for continued eradication in the extended follow-up were 32/39 (82.1%) after 3 months, 26/34 (76. 4%) after 6 months and 13/22 (59.1%) after 9 months. Nineteen patients experienced at least one adverse event. In two patients the trial was prematurely discontinued due to adverse events.
TI  - [Acquired antibiotic resistance in Madagascar: first evaluation].
AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the incidence of acquired resistance to antibiotics in Madagascar. Testing was carried out on total of 1267 strains of medically significant bacteria isolated from specimens sent to the Pasteur Institute of Madagascar in Antananarivo between October 1997 and October 1998. Antibiograms were performed using the diffusion technique on gel media with antibiotic disks. Results were read according to the criteria of the Antibiogram Committee of the French Society of Microbiology. Preliminary findings documented a high incidence of resistance to widely available, low-price antibiotics including penicillin G and tetracycline for which 84 p. 100 and 65 p. 100 of Staphylococcus aureus respectively demonstrated resistance; tetracyclin to which 80 p. 100 of streptococcus were resistant; and ampicillin, cotrimoxazole, and phenicoles to which 60 p. 100, 60 p. 100 and 28 p. 100 of Escherichia coli respectively and 77 p. 100, 83 p. 100, and 71 p. 100 of Shigella sp. respectively were resistant. Second-line antibiotics including penicillin M, macrolides, nalidixic acid, and nitrofuranes were still relatively active, thus providing an effective alternative. Newly developed antibiotics such as fluoroquinolones and third-generation cephalosporines were highly effective but a few resistant strains were observed. Although not representative of Madagascar as a whole, the findings of this preliminary study indicate that acquired resistance must be taken into account in designing simplified decision charts for front-line laboratories, that appropriate information must be made available to health care workers, and that further testing is needed to monitor the evolution of antibiotic resistance.
TI  - Epidemiology and microbiology of surgical wound infections.
AB  - This study included 676 surgery patients with signs and symptoms indicative of wound infections, who presented over the course of 6 years. Bacterial pathogens were isolated from 614 individuals. A single etiologic agent was identified in 271 patients, multiple agents were found in 343, and no agent was identified in 62. A high preponderance of aerobic bacteria was observed. Among the common pathogens were Staphylococcus aureus (191 patients, 28.2%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (170 patients, 25.2%), Escherichia coli (53 patients, 7.8%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (48 patients, 7.1%), and Enterococcus faecalis (38 patients, 5.6%).
TI  - Rapid identification of bacteria in blood cultures by using fluorescently labeled oligonucleotide probes.
AB  - The applicability of whole-cell hybridization for the identification of pathogenic bacteria in blood from septic patients was examined. Oligonucleotide probes, fluorescently labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate, directed against the variable regions of the 16S rRNAs of the following bacterial species and/or genera were used: Streptococcus spp., Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS), Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and the Enterobacteriaceae family. A probe specific for the rRNAs of almost all bacteria and its complementary, reversed counterpart was used as positive and negative control, respectively. The probes were used in conjunction with a fast and simple-to-use protocol for whole-cell hybridization. This protocol yields an identification after 25 to 45 min, depending on whether the bacterium is gram positive or gram negative. A total of 182 blood samples which tested positive in a blood culture machine were investigated. All probes except for the ones for S. aureus and the CoNS showed sensitivities and specificities of 1.000. It was concluded that whole-cell hybridization is well suited for the fast screening of septic blood containing streptococci and/or enterococci or gram-negative rods.
TI  - Surveillance of antibiotic resistance in Taiwan, 1998.
AB  - For the first national surveillance of antibiotic resistance in Taiwan, we collected in 1998 from 22 hospitals (6 medical centers, 15 regional hospitals, and 1 local hospital) 3,211 isolates in all parts of the country. Besides 50 random successive isolates from inpatients, each hospital was requested to collect 25 isolates each from positive blood cultures, hospital-acquired infections, outpatients and the pediatric department. We re-speciated all the submitted specimens and determined their antibiotic susceptibility patterns. The most common isolates were Enterobacteriaceae (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae), Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Among hospital-acquired infections, Acinetobacter spp. were among those which accounted for over 10% of the isolates. The oxacillin resistance of S. aureus was 82% in isolates from hospital-acquired infections, and 40% from outpatients. Among Enterococcus spp., 85% were either E. faecalis or E. faecium. They were 14% resistant to vancomycin. Among gram-negative bacteria, K. pneumoniae and Acinetobacter baumanii were hospital-acquired isolates that were most clearly more resistant than community acquired isolates. This difference was less apparent in the case of Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, and P. aeruginosa. These bacteria were generally more resistant from all sources. Fifty-one percent of Salmonella were resistant to ampicillin; however, these were all sensitive to ciprofloxacin. Isolates from the East were least resistant. Plotting the disc zone diameters of antibiotics within the susceptible range, we identified subpopulations with smaller diameters in the case of vancomycin against S. aureus, ciprofloxacin against E. coli, and ciprofloxacin against Salmonella spp. These findings represent one of the purposes of this surveillance as they may portend developing resistances which bear careful watching in the future.
TI  - Bacteraemia and antibiotic resistance of its pathogens reported in England and Wales between 1990 and 1998: trend analysis.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Determination of causes, trends, and antibiotic resistance in reports of bacterial pathogens isolated from blood in England and Wales from 1990 to 1998. DESIGN: Description of bacterial isolates from blood, judged to be clinically significant by microbiology staff, reported to the Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre. SETTING: Microbiology laboratories in England and Wales. SUBJECTS: Patients yielding clinically significant isolates from blood. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Frequency and Poisson regression analyses for trend of reported causes of bacteraemia and proportions of antibiotic resistant isolates. RESULTS: There was an upward trend in total numbers of reports of bacteraemia. The five most cited organisms accounted for over 60% of reports each year. There was a substantial increase in the proportion of reports of Staphylococcus aureus resistant to methicillin, Streptococcus pneumoniae resistance to penicillin and erythromycin, and Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium resistance to vancomycin. No increase was seen in resistance of Escherichia coli to gentamicin. CONCLUSIONS: Reports from laboratories provide valuable information on trends and antibiotic resistance in bacteraemia and show a worrying increase in resistance to important antibiotics.
TI  - Analysis of a gene cluster of Enterococcus faecalis involved in polysaccharide biosynthesis.
AB  - Previously, we described a gene cluster of Enterococcus faecalis OG1RF that produced an antigenic polysaccharide when cloned in Escherichia coli. The polysaccharide antigen was not detectable in E. faecalis strains, however. Here, we show by reverse transcriptase-PCR that the 16 genes in this region are transcribed in OG1RF. Gene disruption of orfde4, encoding a putative glycosyl transferase, and orfde6, a putative dTDP-rhamnose biosynthesis gene, generated two OG1RF mutants. The mutants showed delayed killing and a higher 50% lethal dose in a mouse peritonitis model. In addition, two mucoid E. faecalis isolates from patients with chronic urinary tract infections were found to produce the polysaccharide antigen.
TI  - Antimicrobial effect of camphorated chloroxylenol (ED 84) in the treatment of infected root canals.
AB  - During and after chemomechanical preparation, particularly before the definitive  filling of an infected root canal, a temporary intracanal dressing with an antimicrobial activity is generally indicated. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the antimicrobial effect of ED 84, a liquid root canal disinfectant containing chloroxylenol (10%) and camphor (15%), against selected test organisms (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, and Candida albicans) both in vitro and under clinical conditions, using extracted teeth. With a contact time of 180 min between undiluted ED 84 and the four bacterial suspensions in the canal, there was a 2 to 3 log reduction in the number of organisms. Under in vitro conditions, the reduction was even greater than 3 logs. When using a liquid medication as a temporary root canal dressing for a duration of approximately 2 days, ED 84 can definitely be used.
TI  - Quality control guidelines for disk diffusion and broth microdilution antimicrobial susceptibility tests with seven drugs for veterinary applications.
AB  - This multicenter study proposes antimicrobial susceptibility (MIC and disk diffusion methods) quality control (QC) parameters for seven compounds utilized in veterinary health. Alexomycin, apramycin, tiamulin, tilmicosin, and tylosin were tested by broth microdilution against various National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS)-recommended QC organisms (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Streptococcus pneumoniae ATCC 49619, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853). In addition, disk diffusion zone diameter QC limits were determined for apramycin, enrofloxacin, and premafloxacin by using E. coli ATCC 25922, P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853, and S. aureus ATCC 25923. The results from five or six participating laboratories produced >/=99.0% of MICs and >/=95.0% of the zone diameters within suggested guidelines. The NCCLS Subcommittee for Veterinary Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing has recently approved these ranges for publication in the next M31 document.
TI  - It is possible to use herbarium specimens to screen for antibacterial components  in some plants.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of herbarium specimens of Combretum erythrophyllum growing in the Pretoria area and originally collected between 92 and 12 years ago were compared with freshly collected leaves. There were no differences in the minimal inhibitory concentration of the different samples with Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa as test organisms. There were only minor differences in chromatograms separating terpenoids and flavonoids. Light fungal infection indicated by small spots on herbarium leaves generally did not influence the MIC value or the chromatographic profile much, but heavy fungal attack decreased the biological activity of the extracts. Application of the technique to Helichrysum pedunculatum specimens showed that the chemical components apparently did not change over a period of 100 years and the biological activity did not decrease. The examination of herbarium material may be a useful first step to screen plants with stable biologically active components or to establish a scientific base for the use of a plant in traditional medicine.
TI  - Efficacy of antimicrobial-impregnated bladder catheters in reducing catheter-associated bacteriuria: a prospective, randomized, multicenter clinical trial.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine the efficacy of bladder catheters impregnated with minocycline and rifampin in reducing catheter-associated bacteriuria. METHODS: A prospective, randomized clinical trial was conducted at five academic medical centers. Patients undergoing radical prostatectomy were randomized to receive intraoperatively either regular silicone bladder catheters (control catheters) or silicone bladder catheters impregnated with minocycline and rifampin (antimicrobial-impregnated catheters). Catheters remained in place for a mean of 2 weeks. Urine cultures were obtained at about 3, 7, and 14 days after catheter insertion. Bacteriuria was defined as the growth of organism(s) in urine at a concentration of 10(4) colony-forming units per milliliter or greater. RESULTS: Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that it took significantly longer for patients (n = 56) who received the antimicrobial-impregnated catheters to develop bacteriuria than those (n = 68) who received the control catheters (P = 0.006 by the log-rank test). Patients who received the antimicrobial-impregnated catheters had significantly lower rates of bacteriuria than those in the control group both at day 7 (15.2% versus 39.7%) and at day 14 (58.5% versus 83.5%) after catheter insertion. Patients who received the antimicrobial-impregnated catheters had significantly lower rates of gram-positive bacteriuria than the control group (7.1% versus 38.2%; P <0.001) but similar rates of gram-negative bacteriuria (46.4% versus 47.1%) and candiduria (3.6% versus 2.9%). The antimicrobial-impregnated catheters provided zones of inhibition against Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli, both at baseline and on removal. CONCLUSIONS: Bladder catheters impregnated with minocycline and rifampin significantly reduced the rate of gram-positive catheter-associated bacteriuria up to 2 weeks after catheter insertion.
TI  - Characterization of high-pressure-treated egg albumen.
AB  - Addition of NaCl or sucrose to egg albumen prior to high-pressure treatment (up to 10 min at 800 MPa) prevented insolubilization or gel formation after pressure treatment. As a consequence of protein unfolding, the treated albumen had increased viscosity but retained its foaming and heat-gelling properties. Susceptibility of egg albumen proteins to hydrolysis by trypsin increased dramatically after pressure treatment. The S-form of ovalbumin, the presence of which is an index of egg aging, was not found in any of the pressure-treated samples, which also did not display evidence for covalent protein aggregation. However, recognition of ovalbumin by an anti-ovalbumin antiserum was reduced to 40% of that of untreated sample.
TI  - Potential of an antibacterial ultraviolet-irradiated nylon film.
AB  - The antibacterial effectiveness of an ultraviolet-irradiated nylon 6, 6 film was  investigated for potential use as a food-packaging material to reduce the surface microbial contamination of foods. The film-surface analyses showed that UV irradiation induced conversion of surface amide groups to amines. Irradiation also increased the dimensional scale of the film surface topography (depth of valleys) approximately 5-fold on the scale of nanometers. The irradiated nylon demonstrated antagonistic activity against Staphylococcus aureus 25923 and Escherichia coli TV1058 with 4.5 and 6 log reductions, respectively, of an initial population of 10(6) cfu mL(-1). The irradiated nylon was ineffective against Pseudomonas fluorescens 13525 and Enterococcus faecalis 19433 under similar conditions. The film demonstrated increased antimicrobial activity against S. aureus 25923 with increasing temperatures up to 45 degrees C, the highest temperature tested. Protein and salt inhibited the antibacterial nature of the irradiated film. Amines in solution (4.31 x 10(-8) M; the calculated equivalent of amines on the film) killed at least 1 x 10(4) cfu mL(-1) E. coli TV1058, and 4. 31 x 10(-7) M amines killed up to 1 x 10(7) cfu mL(-1) E. coli TV1058. The amines in solution required similar exposure time to the bacteria for population reduction as was observed with the irradiated film.
TI  - [Bacterial content of the enucleated prostate gland].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of prostatic colonization or infection in  patients undergoing prostatic surgery for obstructive symptoms due to benign hyperplasia of the prostate (BPH), to identify and quantitate the microorganisms isolated in quantitative bacterial tissue cultures, and to determine the influence of open surgery vs endoscopy on the microbiological findings. METHODS: A prospective study was conducted on 175 patients undergoing surgery for BPH. All patients were entered into a study protocol that included quantitative bacterial cultures of prostatic tissue. Data of previously defined variables were entered into a data base for subsequent analysis comprised of redefinition of the variables and descriptive and analytical studies. RESULTS: 44 of the 175 patients (25.1%) had a positive bacterial culture of prostatic tissue. Histological lesions indicating prostatitis associated with BPH were found in 68 of the 175 patients (38.9%), regardless of the presence or absence of bacteria. Of these 68 patients with histologically demonstrated prostatic inflammation, only 19 (27.9%) had a positive prostatic tissue culture. The incidence of granulomatous prostatitis was 1.1%. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of bacteria was demonstrated in prostates of a significant number of patients (25.1%) undergoing prostatectomy for BPH. The microorganisms most frequently isolated in the quantitative bacterial cultures were, by order of frequency, coagulase negative Staphylococci, Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis, which were present in concentrations of at least 10(4) CFU/Gm in prostatic tissue of 79.6% of the cases. No differences were found between the type of procedure the patient underwent and the presence or absence of prostatic infection.
TI  - Structure-activity relationships of novel 2-substituted quinazoline antibacterial agents.
AB  - High-throughput screening of in-house compound libraries led to the discovery of  a novel antibacterial agent, compound 1 (MIC: 12-25 microM against S. pyogenes). In an effort to improve the activity of this active compound, a series of 2-substituted quinazolines was synthesized and evaluated in several antibacterial assays. One such compound (22) displayed improved broad-spectrum antibacterial activity against a variety of bacterial strains. This molecule also inhibited transcription/translation of bacterial RNA, suggesting a mechanism for its antibiotic effects. Structure-activity relationship studies of 22 led to the synthesis of another 24 compounds. Although some of these molecules were found to be active in bacterial growth assays, none were as potent as 22. Compound 22 was tested for its ability to cure a systemic K. pneumonia infection in the mouse and displayed moderate effects compared with a control antibiotic, gentamycin.
TI  - The role of recombination and mutation in 16S-23S rDNA spacer rearrangements.
AB  - The intragenomic heterogeneity of the bacterial intergenic (16S-23S rDNA) spacer  region (ISR) was analysed from the following species in which sequences for the complete rRNA operon (rrn) set have been determined (rrn number): Enterococcus faecalis (6) and E. faecium (6), Bacillus subtilis (10), Staphylococcus aureus (9), Vibrio cholerae (4), Haemophilus influenzae (6) and Escherichia coli (7). It was found that some spacer sequence blocks were highly conserved between operons of a genome, whereas the presence of others was variable. When these variations were analysed using the program PLATO and partial likelihood phylogenies determined by DNAml for each operon set, three regions showed significant (Z>3.3) spatial variation [Region I was 78-184 nt long (2.1<Z<49.4), Region II was 10-60 nt long (3.7<Z<23)] and Region III was 6 nt long (3.4<Z>4.4) possibly due to recombination or selection. Within Region I, there was sequence block variation in all operon sets [some operons contained tRNA genes (tRNAala, tRNAile or tRNAglu), whereas others had sequence blocks such as VS2 (S. aureus) or rsl (E. coli)]. Q Analysis of the ISR sequence from E. faecalis and E. faecium showed that there was more interspecies than intraspecies variation (both in DNA sequence and in the presence or absence of blocks). Dot matrix analysis of the sequence blocks in the nine rrn ISRs from S. aureus showed that there was significant homology between VS2 and VS5/VS6. Furthermore, repeat motifs with only A or T were present in higher copy numbers in VS5/VS6 than in VS2. Since these sequence blocks (VS2 and VS5-VS6) are related, intragenic evolution resulting in AT expansion may have occurred between these two regions. A model is proposed that postulates a role for recombination and AT-expansion in intra-genomic ISR variations. This process may represent a general mechanism of concerted evolution for bacterial ISR rearrangements.
TI  - [Preventive effect of postoperative disinfection of endoscope on bacterial adhesion to endoscope].
AB  - We took culture of throat swab from 77 subjects who were negative for infection of HBV, HCV, HIV and syphilis infection before and after endoscopy. Moreover, the existence of bacterium including Helicobacter pylori at overcoat of endoscopic instrument was investigated right after examination and after disinfection of endoscope. Povidoneiodine, 70% alcohol and 1% benzalkonium chloride was used as a disinfectant for endoscope, and it took less than 10 minutes to wash by hand to disinfection. alpha-haemolytic streptococci, Staphylococcus epidermids, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Candida, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and MRSA were cultured in throat swab. The rate of adhesion of bacterium especially such as Candida, K. pneumoniae and S. epidermids to endoscope was considerably high. 23 of 77 subjects had H. pylori infection, and the adhesion of H. pylori to endoscope was found to be 65.2% of the subjects. On the contrast, no bacterium was detected from the endoscopic instrument after careful disinfection. These findings stress the importance of postoperative disinfection of the endoscope to prevent the chance to acquire bacterial infection.
TI  - An Escherichia coli-Enterococcus faecalis shuttle vector as a tool for the construction of a group B Streptococcus heterologous mutant expressing the beta antigen (Bac) of the C protein complex.
AB  - Group B streptococci (GBS) represent a very important group of human pathogens. So far little is known about the mechanisms by which these bacteria can cause disease and the bacterial factors involved. One putative virulence factor is the beta antigen of the C protein complex (Bac), which can bind to the Fc region of human IgA. Its binding function might represent an important virulence mechanism. However, the genetic manipulation of this group of bacteria, necessary to prove involvement of bacterial factors in pathogenesis, is still in its infancy. We therefore tested the pAM401 vector system for its suitability in the construction of a heterologous expression mutant using the Bac protein as a model antigen. The bac gene, including its own promoter, was cloned into the Escherichia coli-Enterococcus faecalis shuttle vector pAM401 and was stably maintained extrachromosomally in the bac-deficient GBS strain 335. Expression of Bac was assessed by extracting the protein from transformed 335(pPJTU1) cells, negative controls (335 wild-type, 335(pAM401)) and other Bac-expressing GBS strains (A909, LA239). Blots of the extracted proteins probed with IgA, polyclonal sera and a monoclonal antibody raised against Bac clearly revealed expression of the 130-kDa protein in the transformed GBS 335(pPJTU1) cells. The correct processing and surface anchoring of the expressed Bac was demonstrated by binding of (125)I-labelled IgA to whole cells. Strain 335(pPJTU1) bound 12 times as much IgA compared to the parental strain LA239 and the GBS 335 negative controls, and a total of 25% compared to the high-level-expressing strain A909. Our studies show that the pAM401 shuttle vector can be used for stable heterologous expression of surface proteins in GBS. Our strategy is also of major importance for the complementation of deletion mutants in GBS and other Gram-positive human pathogens to fulfill Koch's postulates. The Bac mutant constructed in this study, 335(pPJTU1), can be used in animal models to assess the importance of Bac in GBS pathogenesis.

TI  - Effect of process temperature, pH and suspended solids content upon pasteurization of a model agricultural waste during thermophilic aerobic digestion.
AB  - Thermophilic aerobic digestion(TAD), or liquid composting, is a versatile new process for the treatment and stabilization of high strength wastes of liquid or, perhaps more importantly, slurry consistency. The pattern of inactivation of various pathogenic and indicator organisms was studied using batch digestions under conditions that may be expected to be found in full-scale TAD processes. Rapid inactivation of test populations occurred within the first 10 min from the start of digestion. The inactivation rate was slightly lower when digestions were conducted below 60 degrees C. In some instances, a 'tail' was apparent, possibly indicating the survival of relatively resistant sub-populations particularly in the case of Serratia marcescens and Enterococcus faecalis, or of clumping or attachment of cells to particulate materials. The effect of pH on the inactivation of the test populations depended on the temperature of digestion, but varied with the test population. At 55 degrees C Escherichia coli was more sensitive to temperature effects at pH 7 than at pH 8, but was more sensitive at pH 8, 60 degrees C. The reverse was the case at 60 degrees C for Ent. faecalis. An increase in the solid content of the digesting waste caused a progressive increase in the protection of test organisms from thermal inactivation. Challenging a TAD process with test strains allows (via estimation of D-values) a quantification of the cidal effects of such processes, with a view to manipulating process variables to enhance such effects.
TI  - Ciprofloxacin in treatment of nosocomial meningitis in neonates and in infants: report of 12 cases and review.
AB  - Twelve cases of neonatal and infant nosocomial meningitis treated with intravenous ciprofloxacin in doses of 10 to 60 mg/kg/day are described. Four neonates were 21 to 28 days old and eight infants were 2 to 6 months old. Six presented with Gram-negative meningitis: Escherichia coli (2), Salmonella enteritidis (1), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (1), two with two organisms, and (H. influenzae plus Staphylococcus epidermidis, Acinetobacter spp. plus S. epidermidis), and six were attributable to Gram-positive cocci (four S. aureus and two Enterococcus faecalis). Ten cases were cured. In two cases, reversible hydrocephalus appeared that responded to intraventricular punctures. In seven children, no neurologic sequellae appeared after a 2- to 4-year follow-up. One neonate had relapse of meningitis 3 months later and was ultimately cured, but developed a sequellae of psychomotoric retardation. Follow-up varied from 27 months to 10 years. Current published case reports from Medline on quinolone use in meningitis in neonates and infants are reviewed.
TI  - An evaluation of the action of different root canal irrigants on facultative aerobic-anaerobic, obligate anaerobic, and microaerophilic bacteria.
AB  - The aim of this study was to test the effect of different concentrations of sodium hypochlorite, chlorhexidine, and cetrimide on the following bacterial strains: Facultative aerobes-anaerobes: Candida albicans ATCC 10231; Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212; Escherichia coli ATCC 25,922; Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27,853; Streptococcus mitis ATCC 9811; Streptococcus mutans ATCC 35668; Streptococcus salivarius ATCC 13419; and Streptococcus sanguis ATCC 10556. Microaerophiles: Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans ATCC 29522. Obligate anaerobes: Actinomyces odontolyticus ATCC 17929; Fusobacterium nucleatum ATCC 25,586; Porphyromonas gingivalis ATCC 33277; and Prevotella melaninogenica ATCC 25845. Each irrigant was kept in contact with the bacterial species used for the experiment for 10, 20, or 30 min. Results showed that all irrigants had a bactericidal effect on both facultative aerobes-anaerobes and on microaerophilic and obligate anaerobic strains, in all concentrations and even after short periods of contact.
TI  - The effect of water, ascorbic acid, and cranberry derived supplementation on human urine and uropathogen adhesion to silicone rubber.
AB  - In this study, urine was collected from groups of volunteers following the consumption of water, ascorbic acid, or cranberry supplements. Only ascorbic acid intake consistently produced acidic urine. Photospectroscopy data indicated that increased water consumption produced urine with lower protein content. Surface tension measurements of the collected urine showed that both water and cranberry supplementation consistently produced urine with surface tensions higher than the control or urine collected following ascorbic acid intake. These urine samples were also employed to study uropathogen adhesion to silicone rubber in a parallel plate flow chamber. Urine obtained after ascorbic acid or cranberry supplementation reduced the initial deposition rates and numbers of adherent Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis, but not Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, or Candida albicans. Conversely, urine obtained from subjects with increased water intake vastly increased the initial deposition rates and numbers of adherent E. coli and E. faecalis (P < 0.05).
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of FK041, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  - The in vitro activity of FK041, a new orally active cephem antibiotic, against a  wide variety of clinical isolates of bacteria was investigated and compared with those of cefdinir (CFDN) and cefditoren (CDTR). FK041 exhibited broad spectrum activity against reference strains of Gram-positive and Gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. FK041 was active against clinical isolates of Gram-positive organisms except Enterococcus faecalis with MIC90s less than 1.56 microg/ml. FK041 was more active than CFDN and CDTR against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus agalactiae and was comparable to CFDN and CDTR against Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae. FK041 had no activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococci, like CFDN and CDTR. FK041 showed moderate activity against penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae with an MIC range of 0.05 approximately 3.13 microg/ml, and was superior to CFDN but inferior to CDTR. Against clinical isolates of many Gram-negative organisms such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis, FK041 had good activity comparable or superior to those of CFDN and CDTR. However, it was inferior to CDTR in activity against Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Morganella morganii, and Serratia marcescens, and was inactive against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. With FK041 a small difference between MIC and MBC against S. aureus, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and H. influenzae was found, indicating that its action is bactericidal against these species. FK041 was stable to group 2beta-lactamase hydrolysis but was unstable to group 1beta-lactamase hydrolysis. The stability of FK041 to these enzymes was similar to those of CFDN and CDTR. FK041 showed high affinity for the main penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) of S. aureus (PBP 3, 2, and 1) and E. coli (PBP 3, 4, lbs, 2, and 1a).
TI  - [Development of a vaccine for treatment of urinary tract infections].
AB  - Receiving uroinfections are predominantly treated with antibiotics and chemotherapeutics. An effective alternative treatment can be immunotherapy with inactivated bacteria. The authors have focused on the development of polybacterial vaccine with both specific and nonspecific immunostimulatory activity. The vaccine contains killed bacteria which most frequently occur as an etiological agent in urinary tract infections. Determining for the selection of particular strains for the vaccine preparation were their immunostimulatory properties evaluated after intraperitoneal application of killed cells to mice. The results were evaluated according to weight gain of liver and spleen and verified by histological examination of these organs. The final form of the vaccine URVAKOL contains immunogenically most active strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus faecalis, representing specific effective part of the preparation, adjuvant activity is provided by Propionibacterium acnes. (Tab. 1, Fig. 2, Ref. 27.)
TI  - Surveillance of antibiotic resistance in ICUs in southeastern Sweden. ICU Study Group of the South East of Sweden.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A study was designed to assess a computer-based program for continuous registration of antibiotic resistance, statistics concerning severity of illness, and consumption of antibacterial drugs. METHODS: The frequency of antibiotic resistance among bacteria in eight ICUs in southeastern Sweden was investigated yearly from 1995 through 1997. The antibiotic consumption in the ICUs was registered as defined daily doses (DDD) and compared to severity of illness (APACHE-II scores). RESULTS: There was a statistically significant increase in ampicillin resistance among Enterococcus spp. between 1996 and 1997, which was due to a shift from Enterococcus faecalis to Enterococcus faecium. A high prevalence of resistance among coagulase-negative staphylococci to oxacillin (approximately 70%), ciprofloxacin (approximately 50%), fucidic acid (approximately 50%) and netilmicin (approximately 30%) was seen in all ICUs during the whole study period. There was a statistically significant increase in ciprofloxacin resistance among Escherichia coli and Enterococcus spp. The resistance among Enterobacter spp. to cefotaxime decreased but this change was not statistically significant. Efforts were made to avoid betalactam antibiotics, except carbapenems, for treatment of infections caused by Enterobacter spp. and the consumption of cephalosporins decreased whereas the consumption of carbapenems increased. The total antibiotic consumption decreased by 2.5% during the study period. There was no correlation between APACHE II scores and antibiotic consumption. CONCLUSIONS: Each ICU within a hospital ought to have a program for "on-line" antibiotic resistance surveillance of drugs used in that unit so that changes in empirical treatment can be made when there is an increase in antibiotic-resistant isolates within that unit.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of lidocaine against bacteria associated with nosocomial wound infection.
AB  - The authors characterized the in vitro antibacterial properties of clinical doses of lidocaine on isolates of a variety of bacterial pathogens commonly encountered in the setting of nosocomial wound infection (Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus) as well as a number of resistant strains of methicillin-resistant S. aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococci. Time-kill studies were carried out on bacteria exposed to various clinical concentrations of lidocaine (0%, 1%, 2%, and 4%) with and without epinephrine (1:100,000). Minimum inhibitory concentrations and minimum bactericidal concentrations were determined for some strains using a broth macrodilution method recommended by the National Committee of Clinical Laboratory Standards. Lidocaine demonstrated a dose-dependent inhibition of growth for all strains of bacteria tested. The greatest sensitivity to lidocaine was shown by gram-negative organisms; the least sensitive was S. aureus. The addition of epinephrine to the local anesthetic had no effect on the susceptibility of the bacteria to lidocaine. These observations suggest that the surgical benefit of local anesthesia may extend beyond its analgesic properties and may have a role in the prophylaxis and, in the case of methicillin- and vancomycin-resistant bacteria, the treatment of surgical wound infection, mandating a wider application of this modality.
TI  - Cloning and expression of the pediocin operon in Streptococcus thermophilus and other lactic fermentation bacteria.
AB  - Production of pediocin in Pediococcus acidilactici is associated with pMBR1.0, which encodes prepediocin, a pediocin immunity protein, and two proteins involved in secretion and precursor processing. These four genes are organized as an operon under control of a single promoter. We have constructed shuttle vectors that contain all four structural genes, the chromosomal promoter ST(P2201) from Streptococcus thermophilus, and repA from the 2-kbp S. thermophilus plasmid pER8. The recombinant plasmid, pPC318, expressed and secreted active pediocin in Escherichia coli. Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, and Enterococcus faecalis were electrotransformed with pPC418, a modified vector fitted with an erythromycin resistance tracking gene. Pediocin was produced and secreted in each of the lactic acid bacteria, and production was stable for up to ten passages. The expression of pediocin in dairy fermentation microbes has important implications for bacteriocins as food preservatives in dairy products.
TI  - Characterization of Enterococcus faecalis alkaline phosphatase and use in identifying Streptococcus agalactiae secreted proteins.
AB  - We have identified and characterized an Enterococcus faecalis alkaline phosphatase (AP, encoded by phoZ). The predicted gene product shows homology with alkaline phosphatases from a variety of species; it has especially high similarity with two alkaline phosphatases from Bacillus subtilis. Expression of phoZ in Escherichia coli, E. faecalis, Streptococcus agalactiae (group B streptococcus [GBS]), or Streptococcus pyogenes (group A streptococcus [GAS]) produces a blue-colony phenotype on plates containing a chromogenic substrate, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate (XP or BCIP). Two tests were made to determine if the activity of the enzyme is dependent upon the enzyme's subcellular location. First, elimination of the signal sequence reduced AP activity to 3% of the wild-type activity (or less) in three species of gram-positive bacteria. Restoration of export, using the signal sequence from C5a peptidase, restored AP activity to at least 50% of that of the wild type. Second, we engineered two chimeric proteins in which AP was fused to either a periplasmic domain or a cytoplasmic domain of lactose permease (a membrane protein). In E. coli, the periplasmic fusion had 17-fold-higher AP activity than the cytoplasmic fusion. We concluded that AP activity is export dependent. The signal sequence deletion mutant, phoZDeltass, was used to identify random genomic fragments from GBS that encode exported proteins or integral membrane proteins. Included in this set of fragments were genes that exhibited homology with the Rib protein (a cell wall protein from GBS) or with DppB (an integral membrane protein from GAS). AP acts as a reporter enzyme in GBS, GAS, and E. faecalis and is expected to be useful in a variety of gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Conversion of dieldrin to aldrin by intestinal bacteria in rats.
AB  - The present study provides the evidence that dieldrin is reductively metabolized  to aldrin by intestinal bacteria in rats. When dieldrin was incubated with the cecal contents of rats, aldrin, a reduced metabolite of the epoxide, was isolated from the incubation mixture. The metabolite was identified unequivocally by UV and mass spectral comparison with an authentic sample, and on the basis of its TLC and HPLC behavior. The cecal contents of rats exhibited epoxide reductase activity toward dieldrin under anaerobic conditions. However, only marginal activity was observed under aerobic conditions. Four pure strains of intestinal bacteria exhibited epoxide reductase activities to varying degrees under anaerobic conditions. The highest activity was observed in Clostridium sporogenes. Cell-free extracts of the intestinal bacteria in rat cecal contents showed reductase activity when supplemented with both NAD(P)H and FMN under anaerobic conditions.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents: special references to bacteria isolated between July 1996 and June 1997].
AB  - The annual multicenter studies on isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery and their antimicrobial susceptibility have been conducted in 20 facilities in Japan since July 1982. This paper describes the results obtained during period from July 1996 to June 1997. The number of cases investigated as objectives was 217 for one year. A total of 406 strains were isolated from 177 cases (81.6% of total cases). From primary infections 162 strains were isolated, and from postoperative infections 244 strains were isolated, respectively. From primary infections, anaerobic bacteria were predominant, while from postoperative infections, aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant. Among aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Enterococcus spp. was the highest. In postoperative infections, the majority of them were Enterococcus faecalis, while in primary infections, many of them were Enterococcus avium. The isolation rate of Staphylococcus spp., especially from postoperative infections, followed that of Enterococcus spp. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, Peptostreptococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp. were commonly isolated from both types of infections. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in this order, and from postoperative infections, P. aeruginosa was the most predominantly isolated, followed by E. coli and Enterobacter cloacae. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Bacteroides fragilis group was the majority of isolates from both types of infections. The isolation rate of aerobic Gram-negative bacillus has decreased with time, while those of anaerobes like B. fragilis group and of aerobic Gram-positive bacteria have gradually increased in both types of infections. We found vancomycin-resistant strains of neither Staphylacoccus aureus nor Enterococcus spp.; however, the MIC of arbekacin for one of strains of S. aureus was 100 micrograms/ml. Both the MIC90's of meropenem and imipenem/cilastatin against P. aeruginosa isolated in this term were 25 micrograms/ml, which were higher than those against the strains isolated in the previous years. Compared with the isolated strains in the year 1995, progress of resistance against carbapenem antibiotics was confirmed.
TI  - Antimicrobial peptides from the Brazilian frog Phyllomedusa distincta.
AB  - Different peptides were purified by chromatographic procedures from the skin-secretory glands of the frog Phyllomedusa distincta. These are the first peptides reported from this frog species. Their primary structure was determined by a combination of automated Edman degradation and mass spectrometry. Peptide Q2 contains 25 amino acid residues, peptide Q1 and L have 28 each, peptide M contains 31, and peptide K has 33 amino acid residues. They all showed potent antimicrobial activity against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, presenting minimal inhibitory concentrations from 0.6 to 40 microM, when tested against Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Peptides K, L, and Q1 were chemically synthesized and shown to be active.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance in key bloodstream bacterial isolates: electronic surveillance with the Surveillance Network Database--USA.
AB  - To assess the prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant pathogens among the most common bloodstream isolates, we examined antimicrobial susceptibility data from The Surveillance Network Database-USA, an electronic surveillance system that collects data from 118 clinical microbiology laboratories across the United States. Between 1995 and 1997, resistance to both vancomycin and ampicillin was much more prevalent among Enterococcus faecium than Enterococcus faecalis, suggesting the need for laboratories to identify to species. When staphylococcal isolates were examined for reduced susceptibility to vancomycin (minimum inhibitory concentration = 4 microg/mL), the frequency was highest in methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci. We also learned that nonsusceptibility to ceftazidime in Klebsiella pneumoniae was more prevalent among isolates from blood (12.7%) than among isolates from urine (7.1%) or respiratory sources (9.3%). Although antimicrobial resistance is low overall for isolates of Escherichia coli from blood, the prevalence of cefoxitin resistance among ceftazidime-resistant strains (61.9%) suggests the action of mechanisms other than extended-spectrum beta-lactamase.
TI  - Nosocomial bloodstream infections in United States hospitals: a three-year analysis.
AB  - Nosocomial bloodstream infections are important causes of morbidity and mortality. In this study, concurrent surveillance for nosocomial bloodstream infections at 49 hospitals over a 3-year period detected >10,000 infections. Gram-positive organisms accounted for 64% of cases, gram-negative organisms accounted for 27%, and 8% were caused by fungi. The most common organisms were coagulase-negative staphylococci (32%), Staphylococcus aureus (16%), and enterococci (11%). Enterobacter, Serratia, coagulase-negative staphylococci, and Candida were more likely to cause infections in patients in critical care units. In patients with neutropenia, viridans streptococci were significantly more common. Coagulase-negative staphylococci were the most common pathogens on all clinical services except obstetrics, where Escherichia coli was most common. Methicillin resistance was detected in 29% of S. aureus isolates and 80% of coagulase-negative staphylococci. Vancomycin resistance in enterococci was species-dependent--3% of Enterococcus faecalis strains and 50% of Enterococcus faecium isolates displayed resistance. These data may allow clinicians to better target empirical therapy for hospital-acquired cases of bacteremia.
TI  - [Relationship between preoperative urine cultures and prostatic gland cultures in patients treated for benign prostatic hyperplasia].
AB  - OBJECTIVES: 1.--Investigate the bacteriuria preoperative in patients who will be  operate on for Being Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH). 2.--Define the prevalence of the prostatic colonization or infection. 3.--Try to correlate the bacteriological findings of urine and prostate, and find the degree of concordance between the microorganisms which can be commonly found in urine and prostatic tissue. METHOD AND MATERIALS: Prospective series of 175 patients undergoing prostatectomy for obstructive symptoms. The protocol revealed, among others variables: the preoperative urine culture; the presence or the absence of catheter; and the quantitative bacteriological culture of prostatic tissue. The information could be analised and its results could be obtained later on. The analysis stages consisted of both a descriptive and an analytic study. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: 1.--Only 36 patients (20.6%) presented bacteriological increase of microorganisms (> or = 10(4) UFC/ml) in the preoperative urine culture. The Escherichia coli was the most common microorganism, followed by the Enterococcus faecalis, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus and the Pseudomona aeruginosa. A single microorganism grew in 31 out of the 36 positive cultures. 2.--The prevalence of the infection or colonization of the prostatic tissue was 25.1% (44 patients). The most common isolated microorganism was the coagulase-negative Staphylococcus followed by the Escherichia coli and the Enterococcus faecalis, in concentrations of at least 10(4) UFC/gr of tissue in the 79.6%. A single microorganism was isolated in 32 out of 44 patients. 3.--The proportion of positive prostatic cultures, in patients with positive urine culture (38.3%), was significantly higher than the one obtained in patients with negative urine cultures (16.5%) (p < 0.0001). Nevertheless, 52.3% of the 44 patients with positive prostatic cultures had negative urine culture, and only 21 (58.3%) out of the 36 patients with positive urine cultures presented a bacteriological growth in prostate. The degree of concordance (Kappa index) between the microorganisms which were found in preoperative urine and prostatic tissue is low or none for the majority of them.
TI  - Catabolism of branched-chain alpha-keto acids in Enterococcus faecalis: the bkd gene cluster, enzymes, and metabolic route.
AB  - Genes encoding a branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase from Enterococcus faecalis 10C1, E1alpha (bkdA), E1beta (bkdB), E2 (bkdC), and E3 (bkdD), were found to reside in the gene cluster ptb-buk-bkdDABC. The predicted products of ptb and buk exhibited significant homology to the phosphotransbutyrylase and butyrate kinase, respectively, from Clostridium acetobutylicum. Activity and redox properties of the purified recombinant enzyme encoded by bkdD indicate that E. faecalis has a lipoamide dehydrogenase that is distinct from the lipoamide dehydrogenase associated with the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. Specific activity of the ptb gene product expressed in Escherichia coli was highest with the substrates valeryl-coenzyme A (CoA), isovaleryl-CoA, and isobutyryl-CoA. In cultures, a stoichiometric conversion of alpha-ketoisocaproate to isovalerate was observed, with a concomitant increase in biomass. We propose that alpha-ketoisocaproate is converted via the BKDH complex to isovaleryl-CoA and subsequently converted into isovalerate via the combined actions of the ptb and buk gene products with the concomitant phosphorylation of ADP. In contrast, an E. faecalis bkd mutant constructed by disruption of the bkdA gene did not benefit from having alpha-ketoisocaproate in the growth medium, and conversion to isovalerate was less than 2% of the wild-type conversion. It is concluded that the bkd gene cluster encodes the enzymes that constitute a catabolic pathway for branched-chain alpha-keto acids that was previously unidentified in E. faecalis.
TI  - Comparison of the D-glutamate-adding enzymes from selected gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - The biochemical properties of the D-glutamate-adding enzymes (MurD) from Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Enterococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus aureus were investigated to detect any differences in the activity of this enzyme between gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. The genes (murD) that encode these enzymes were cloned into pMAL-c2 fusion vector and overexpressed as maltose-binding protein-MurD fusion proteins. Each fusion protein was purified to homogeneity by affinity to amylose resin. Proteolytic treatments of the fusion proteins with factor Xa regenerated the individual MurD proteins. It was found that these fusion proteins retain D-glutamate-adding activity and have Km and Vmax values similar to those of the regenerated MurDs, except for the H. influenzae enzyme. Substrate inhibition by UDP-N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanine, the acceptor substrate, was observed at concentrations greater than 15 and 30 microM for E. coli and H. influenzae MurD, respectively. Such substrate inhibition was not observed with the E. faecalis and S. aureus enzymes, up to a substrate concentration of 1 to 2 mM. In addition, the two MurDs of gram-negative origin were shown to require monocations such as NH4+ and/or K+, but not Na+, for optimal activity, while anions such as Cl- and SO4(2-) had no effect on the enzyme activities. The activities of the two MurDs of gram-positive origin, on the other hand, were not affected by any of the ions tested. All four enzymes required Mg2+ for the ligase activity and exhibited optimal activities around pH 8. These differences observed between the gram-positive and gram-negative MurDs indicated that the two gram-negative bacteria may apply a more stringent regulation of cell wall biosynthesis at the early stage of peptidoglycan biosynthesis pathway than do the two gram-positive bacteria. Therefore, the MurD-catalyzed reaction may constitute a fine-tuning step necessary for the gram-negative bacteria to optimally maintain its relatively thin yet essential cell wall structure during all stages of growth.
TI  - A comparison of the kinetics of plasmid transfer in the conjugation systems encoded by the F plasmid from Escherichia coli and plasmid pCF10 from Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - Quantitative measurements of horizontal DNA transfer are critical if one wishes to address questions relating to ecology, evolution and the safe use of recombinant bacteria. Traditionally, the efficiency of a conjugation system has been described by its transfer frequency. However, transfer frequencies can be determined in many ways and may be sensitive to physical, chemical and biological conditions. In this study the authors have used the mechanistic similarity between bacterial conjugation and simple enzyme catalysis in order to calculate the maximal conjugation rate (Vmax) and the recipient concentration (K(m)) at which the conjugation rate is half its maximal value, for two different conjugation systems: the F plasmid from Escherichia coli and plasmid pCF10 from Enterococcus faecalis. The results are compared with the data obtained from the aggregation-mediated conjugation system encoded on pXO16 from Bacillus thuringiensis. The conjugation systems analysed are fundamentally different; however, they have some characteristics in common: they are able to sustain conjugative transfer in liquid medium and the transfer efficiencies are very high. Conjugation encoded by the F plasmid in E. coli involves the formation of small aggregates (2-20 cells), established by sex pili, and the plasmid's maximal conjugation rate was estimated to be approximately 0.15 transconjugants per donor per minute. Pheromone-induced conjugation in Ent. faecalis, which involves the formation of large aggregates, was found to proceed at a maximal conjugation rate of 0.29 transconjugants per donor per minute. Also, the K(m) value differed significantly between these conjugation systems; this may reflect the inherent differences in mating pair formation and transfer mechanisms. In these conjugation systems, the donors underwent a 'recovery period' between rounds of conjugative transfer and newly formed transconjugants required a period of about 40-80 min to mature into proficient donors.
TI  - Verifying apple cider plant sanitation and hazard analysis critical control point programs: choice of indicator bacteria and testing methods.
AB  - The objectives of this study were (i) to evaluate the survival of coliforms, Escherichia coli, and enterococci in refrigerated apple cider; (ii) to develop simple and inexpensive presumptive methods for detection of these bacteria; (iii) to perform a field survey to determine the prevalence of these bacteria on apples and in apple cider; and (iv) based on our results, to recommend the most useful of these three indicator groups for use in verifying apple cider processing plant sanitation and hazard analysis critical control point (HACCP) programs. Eight of 10 coliform strains (5 E. coli, 1 Enterobacter aerogenes, and 2 Klebsiella spp.) inoculated into preservative-free apple cider (pH 3.4, 13.3(o) Brix) survived well at 4 degrees C for 6 days (< or = 3.0 log10 CFU/ml decrease). Of 21 enterococci strains (Enterococcus faecalis, E. faecium, and E. durans), only 2 E. durans and 3 E. faecium strains survived well. Simple broth-based colorimetric methods were developed that detected the presence of approximately 10 cells of coliforms or enterococci. In three field studies, samples of unwashed apples (drops and picked), washed apples, and freshly pressed cider were presumptively analyzed for total coliforms, E. coli, and enterococci using qualitative and/or quantitative methods. Drop apples were more likely than picked apples to be contaminated with E. coli (26.7% vs. 0%) and enterococci (20% vs. 0%). Washing had little effect on coliform populations and in one field study was associated with increased numbers. Total coliform populations in cider ranged from < 1 CFU/ml to > 738 most probable number/ml, depending on the enumeration method used and the sample origin. E. coli was not recovered from washed apples or cider, but enterococci were present on 13% of washed apple samples. The qualitative coliform method successfully detected these bacteria on apples and in cider. Based on its exclusively fecal origin, good survival in apple cider, and association with drop apples, we conclude that E. coli is the most useful organism for verifying apple cider sanitation and HACCP programs.
TI  - Prevalence of aminoglycoside resistance in 20 European university hospitals participating in the European SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Programme.
AB  - The aim of this study was to analyse the current prevalence of aminoglycoside resistance in Europe and compare the in vitro activity of amikacin, gentamicin, and tobramycin against 7057 bacterial isolates from 20 university hospitals participating in the European SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Programme. Amikacin exhibited better in vitro activity than tobramycin and gentamicin against most gram-negative bacilli in Europe. The resistance levels were 0.4-3% for amikacin, 2-13.1% for gentamicin, and 2.5-15.3% for tobramycin among different members of the family Enterobacteriaceae. Of the Staphylococcus aureus isolates tested, 75% were susceptible to gentamicin. Only 21% of all enterococcal strains tested were fully susceptible to gentamicin. Although intra-country variations in the prevalence of resistance phenotypes in Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., and Pseudomonas aeruginosa as well as in staphylococci and enterococci did occur, aminoglycoside resistance rates were generally higher in Italy, Portugal, Spain, Greece, France, the UK, and Poland than in Austria, Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, and Switzerland. Compared with the 1987-88 data of the European Study Group on Antibiotic Resistance, gentamicin resistance has increased up to 5% in some gram-negative bacterial species. Furthermore, a greater than 10% increase in resistance to gentamicin has been seen in Staphylococcus aureus during the last decade. The reason for this observation is unclear, although changes in antibiotic prescribing patterns that result in increased selective pressure from gentamicin may have contributed to these increased rates of aminoglycoside resistance.
TI  - Comparison of sparfloxacin and ciprofloxacin in the treatment of community-acquired acute uncomplicated urinary tract infection in women. Sparfloxacin Multicenter Uncomplicated Urinary Tract Infection Study Group.
AB  - Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common illness, with > or =30% of all women experiencing a UTI during their lifetime. Less than a decade ago, the standard therapy for acute uncomplicated UTIs involved treatment with > or =7 days of an antibacterial agent, but recent studies using a variety of newly introduced antibiotics, including the fluoroquinolones, have demonstrated that a 1- to 5-day treatment regimen can be equally effective. This randomized, double-masked, multicenter study was conducted to compare the efficacy and tolerability of a single dose of sparfloxacin with those of a 3-day regimen of sparfloxacin and a 7-day regimen of ciprofloxacin in the treatment of women with community-acquired acute uncomplicated urinary tract infection. A total of 1175 women were enrolled; 395 received sparfloxacin as a single 400-mg dose on day 1, 394 received sparfloxacin as a 400-mg loading dose on day 1 followed by 200 mg once daily for 2 additional days, and 386 received ciprofloxacin 250 mg twice daily for 7 days. Patients were comparable with respect to demographic characteristics and underlying conditions. A total of 954 patients were clinically assessable; 490 of these were also bacteriologically assessable. All patients treated were included in the tolerability analysis. Escherichia coli (75.4%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (4.9%), Enterococcus faecalis (4.6%), and Staphylococcus saprophyticus (4.1%) were the most commonly isolated organisms. In the all-treated population, clinical success was achieved 5 to 9 days after therapy in 91.8%, 92.2%, and 91.6% of patients in the single-dose sparfloxacin, 3-day sparfloxacin, and 7-day ciprofloxacin groups, respectively; bacteriologic success was observed in 91.7%, 92.6%, and 96.6% of those in the 3 groups. Sustained clinical success rates 4 to 6 weeks after therapy were 76.6%, 80.2%, and 79.5% in the single-dose sparfloxacin, 3-day sparfloxacin, and 7-day ciprofloxacin groups, respectively; sustained bacteriologic success rates were 80.7%, 90.1%, and 92.6%. The most common adverse events were nausea, headache, vaginal thrush, dizziness, and diarrhea; >92% of adverse events were mild or moderate in severity. The 2 drugs had comparable frequencies of adverse events, except for photosensitivity, which occurred in 3.3% of the 3-day sparfloxacin group, 1.3% of the single-dose sparfloxacin group, and 0.3% of the ciprofloxacin group (P = 0.005). The 3-day sparfloxacin regimen was effective and well tolerated. The initial response to single-dose sparfloxacin treatment was comparable to the response to the other 2 regimens, but the single-dose regimen proved less effective over time, with higher rates of clinical recurrence and bacteriologic relapse. Sparfloxacin provides an alternative to ciprofloxacin for patients with acute uncomplicated urinary tract infection who are not at risk for photosensitivity reactions or adverse events associated with a prolonged corrected QT interval.
TI  - Formation and structure of mixed bacterial communities.
AB  - Mixed bacterial communities are formed by unrelated bacteria on solid media. Mixed bacterial communities on solid media are similar to "classical" colonies and are formed after the growth of a large number of unrelated bacteria simultaneously plated onto a limited area of agar. The morphology of the mixed bacterial communities was similar for different combinations of bacteria and did not change when the bacteria were plated on different media. Different bacterial strains form zones of individual and mixed growth in the structure of mixed bacterial communities. The results of electron microscopic examination indicate that mixed bacterial communities are isolated from their external environment by a surface film. The basic part of this film is formed by an elementary membrane. The membrane of the surface film of mixed bacterial communities is a stable structure occupying a large surface area. The results of this investigation seem to indicate the existence of a special type of co-operation between different species of bacteria. This type of co-operation may be very important in the regulation of interactions between different bacteria and between bacteria and the environment.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of essential oils and other plant extracts.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of plant oils and extracts has been recognized for many years. However, few investigations have compared large numbers of oils and extracts using methods that are directly comparable. In the present study, 52 plant oils and extracts were investigated for activity against Acinetobacter baumanii, Aeromonas veronii biogroup sobria, Candida albicans, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia col, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serotype typhimurium, Serratia marcescens and Staphylococcus aureus, using an agar dilution method. Lemongrass, oregano and bay inhibited all organisms at concentrations of < or = 2.0% (v/v). Six oils did not inhibit any organisms at the highest concentration, which was 2.0% (v/v) oil for apricot kernel, evening primrose, macadamia, pumpkin, sage and sweet almond. Variable activity was recorded for the remaining oils. Twenty of the plant oils and extracts were investigated, using a broth microdilution method, for activity against C. albicans, Staph. aureus and E. coli. The lowest minimum inhibitory concentrations were 0.03% (v/v) thyme oil against C. albicans and E. coli and 0.008% (v/v) vetiver oil against Staph. aureus. These results support the notion that plant essential oils and extracts may have a role as pharmaceuticals and preservatives.
TI  - Efficacy of trovafloxacin in an in vitro pharmacodynamic simulation of an intraabdominal infection.
AB  - An in vitro model simulating trovafloxacin concentrations in human serum after standard doses was used to investigate the activity of this drug with time against Bacteroides fragilis, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus. Antibiotic concentrations used for each incubation period were: 4.24 mg/l (0-1 h), 3.69 mg/l (1-3 h), 3.25 mg/l (3-6 h), 2.38 mg/l (6-8 h), 1.35 mg/l (8-24 h). A 99.9% initial inoculum reduction (> 3 log10 cfu/ml) was defined as bactericidal activity. Bactericidal activity against these organisms was obtained with trovafloxacin after the first hour of incubation, and similar activity was obtained against B. fragilis, E. faecalis and S. aureus after 3 h, when they were tested individually. When the strains were tested as mixed culture, there was bactericidal activity against E. coli after 1 h incubation and after 3 h for S. aureus. This activity was observed against B. fragilis and E. faecalis after 6 h incubation in the mixed culture assays and after 3 h when organisms were tested individually. Regrowth was not observed over a 24 h period. These data show that trovafloxacin might be effective in intraabdominal infections caused by mixed aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms.
TI  - Antibacterial and antifungal activities of complexes of ruthenium (II).
AB  - Twenty ruthenium (II) complexes (1-5) were evaluated for their in vitro antibacterial and antifungal activity against Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29212), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 29213), Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853), Candida albicans and Candida tropicalis. Compounds 1d, 1e, 1h, 1i and 1j showed more pronounced antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria and fungi as compared to the nitrogen donor ruthenium complexes; hydrophobic substituents were significantly more effective. None of the compounds 1-5 exhibited antimicrobial activity against the Gram-negative strains Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853) with the concentrations ranging between 12.5 and 800 micrograms/ml.
TI  - [Survey of the sensitivities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents (annual report)].
AB  - Research groups were formed in 21 institutions nationwide to investigate carbapenem resistance. The activities of various antibacterial agents, principally carbapenems, were tested against clinical isolates collected from these institutions. The broth microdilution method was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of 17 antibacterial agents for 1,241 strains of 11 bacterial species isolated at all institutions between October and December 1996. The results were as follows: Carbapenems exhibited strong antibacterial activities against MSSA and Streptococcus pneumoniae and showed low activities against MRSA. Their activities against Enterococcus faecalis were comparable to that of ampicillin and piperacillin. The carbapenems showed high activities against Haemophilis influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae. Enterobacter cloacae. Serratia marcescens and Bacteroides fragilis group. Their activities were greater than that exhibited by other beta-lactam antibacterial agents, but some resistant strains of Serratia marcescens were detected. The antibacterial activity of carbapenems against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was comparable to that of CAZ, and there were some resistant strains.
TI  - In-vitro activity of moxifloxacin against fluoroquinolone-resistant strains of aerobic gram-negative bacilli and Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - MICs of the new fluoroquinolone, moxifloxacin, and those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and sparfloxacin for 19 genetically characterized fluoroquinolone-resistant strains were determined by the agar dilution method. The MICs of moxifloxacin for Escherichia isolates with one mutation in gyrA (corresponding to Ser83-->Leu or Asp87-->Gly substitution) were 0.25-0.5 mg/L, while those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and sparfloxacin were 0.06-0.25, 1 and 0.12-0.5 mg/L, respectively. These values were four- to 16-fold higher than those of the same antibiotics for the wild-type strain, E. coli KL16. Similar results were observed with clinical isolates of Salmonella spp. harbouring one mutation in gyrA leading to the substitution of Ser83 by Phe or Tyr. In the presence of two mutations in the E. coli gyrA gene, the MICs of moxifloxacin ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and sparfloxacin were 2, 0.5, 4 and 1 mg/L, respectively; these were 32 times higher than the MICs of these agents for E. coli KL16. The MICs of the four quinolones for triple mutants with two mutations in gyrA and one in parC were even higher, i.e. 8, 8, 16 and 8-16 mg/L, respectively. The MICs of moxifloxacin for Campylobacter coli and Campylobacter jejuni strains with a gyrA mutation leading to Thr86-->Ile substitution ranged from 1 to 2 mg/L, while the MICs of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and sparfloxacin were 16-32 mg/L, 8-16 and 4-8 mg/L, respectively. For high-level ciprofloxacin-resistant (MICs of 32 mg/L) clinical isolates of Enterococcus faecalis with one substitution at position 83 in GyrA (E. coli coordinates), the MICs of moxifloxacin, ofloxacin and sparfloxacin were 8-16, > or = 128 and 32 mg/L respectively. In conclusion, moxifloxacin and other fluoroquinolones exhibit cross-resistance against aerobic gram-negative bacilli and enterococci. The in-vitro activity of moxifloxacin was greater than that of ofloxacin and slightly less than that of ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against Enterobacteriaceae, but greater than those of the three other compounds tested against Campylobacter spp and E. faecalis.
TI  - Fosfomycin tromethamine susceptibility of outpatient urine isolates of Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis from ten North American medical centres by three methods.
AB  - One hundred percent of 1097 Escherichia coli and 97.5% of 157 Enterococcus faecalis isolates from outpatient urine specimens at ten North American medical centres were susceptible to fosfomycin tromethamine. The Etest MICs correlated well with those of agar dilution. Disc diffusion zone diameters correlated well with MICs and supported the previously proposed zone diameter breakpoints for fosfomycin.
TI  - Bacterial pollution of cutting fluids: a risk factor for occupational diseases.
AB  - An outbreak of occupational diseases involving 38 metal workers with local infections on the hands and the face (53%), bronchitis (29%), and bronchopneumonia (18%) urged an examination of 150 samples of emulsions which the workers used in processing metals. Among the isolated bacteria, the most frequent was Pseudomonas aeruginosa (48%), followed by Escherichia coli (44%), Proteus spp. (11%), Enterococcus faecalis (9%), Enterobacter aerogenes (7%), Citrobacter spp. (5%), Shigella spp., Staphylococcus aureus (3%), and the sulphite reducing Clostridia (1%). Moulds and yeasts were isolated from all tested samples. Most samples counted about 3 x 10(5)/ml of colony forming units. It was concluded that all emulsions and other substances which come in direct contact with the workers should be regularly monitored. Furthermore, preservatives should be added to prevent microbial infection.
TI  - Antimicrobial effects of various endodontic irrigants on selected microorganisms.
AB  - AIM: This study was undertaken to determine the antimicrobial effect of various endodontic irrigants against six selected microorganisms. METHODOLOGY: Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus salivarius, Str. pyogenes, Escherichia coli and Candida albicans were included in the study. Pre-sterilized Whatman paper discs, 6 mm in diameter and soaked with the test solution, were prepared and placed onto the previously seeded agar Petri plates. Each plate was incubated aerobically. A zone of inhibition was recorded for each plate and the results were analysed statistically. RESULTS: 5.25% NaOCl was effective against all test microorganisms with a substantial zone of inhibition. Saline was always ineffective. Decreased concentration of NaOCl significantly reduced its antimicrobial effect. Cresophene showed a significantly larger (P < 0.05) average zone of inhibition compared to the other experimental irrigants. Alcohol had smaller but not significantly different zones of inhibition than chlorhexidine. CONCLUSIONS: 5.25% NaOCl was superior in its antimicrobial abilities compared with other irrigants used. A reduced concentration of NaOCl (0.5%) resulted in significantly decreased antimicrobial effects. When compared with 21% alcohol, 0.5% NaOCl and 2% chlorhexidine, paramonochlorophenol (cresophene) showed a greater antimicrobial effect.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (1997). III Secular changes in susceptibility].
AB  - Susceptibilities to various antimicrobial agents were examined for Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Echerichia coli, Klebsiella spp., and Pseudomonas aeruginosa that were isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 9 hospitals during June 1997 to May 1998, and the results were compared with those obtained during the same period in earlier years. 1. E. faecalis The MIC90s of quinolones for E. faecalis isolated from uncomplicated UTIs have changed better state during the latest period. Among E. faecalis strains, those with high susceptibilities to ampicillin (ABPC) and minocycline (MINO) appeared to had decreased during period of 1995-1997, which recovered during the latest period. 2. S. aureus The sensitive strains of S. aureus to imipenem (IPM) and clindamycin (CLDM) had increased during the period of 1996-1997, but those have decreased again during the latest period. 3. E. coli The susceptibilities of E. coli to MINO have been better in the latest period with the MIC90 was ranged from 2 to 4 micrograms/ml. The susceptibilities to quinolones of E. coli isolated from complicated UTIs had decreased during the period of 1995-1997, but those have recovered during the latest period. 4. Klebsiella spp. Among Klebsiella spp. strains isolated from uncomplicated UTIs, those with low susceptibilities to almost cephems have increased in the latest period. To other antimicrobial agents, the susceptibilities of Klebsiella spp. did not show any changes during the latest period. 5. P. aeruginosa The susceptibilities to most agents of P. aeruginosa did not show any changes, the decreased susceptibilities to cefozopran (CZOP), carbapenems and monobactams of P. aeruginosa observed in 1996 appeared to have been retrieved in 1997. These susceptibility changes should be utilized in determining clinical treatments.
TI  - Screening of medicinal plants from Trinidad and Tobago for antimicrobial and insecticidal properties.
AB  - Antibacterial activity in 51 extracts from 29 plant species currently used in traditional medicine in Trinidad and the neighbouring Caribbean islands was tested for by the agar dilution streak method using six bacteria: Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Salmonella tophimurium, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis. The extracts from eight of the plants tested showed significant activity against one or more micro-organisms and the most susceptible bacterium was Staphylococcus aureus. In the bioassays for toxicity towards the Aedes aegypti mosquito the most effective plant extracts were from Justicia pectoralis, Manihot utilissima and Stachytarpheta jamaicensis.
TI  - Synthesis and structure-activity relationship of novel glycylcycline derivatives  leading to the discovery of GAR-936.
AB  - A number of new glycylcyclines were synthesized for structure-activity relationship study. Many of the derivatives exhibit potent, broad spectrum antibacterial activity against both tetracycline susceptible and resistant organisms. GAR-936 (TBG-MINO) shows better activity than the previously reported DMG-MINO and DMG-DMDOT.
TI  - Conjugative mobilization of the rolling-circle plasmid pIP823 from Listeria monocytogenes BM4293 among gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - We determined the sequence and genetic organization of plasmid pIP823, which contains the dfrD gene; dfrD confers high-level trimethoprim resistance to Listeria monocytogenes BM4293 by synthesis of dihydrofolate reductase type S2. pIP823 possessed all the features of the pUB110/pC194 plasmid family, whose members replicate by the rolling-circle mechanism. The rep gene encoded a protein identical to RepU, the protein required for initiation of the replication of plasmids pTB913 from a thermophilic Bacillus sp. and pUB110 from Staphylococcus aureus. The mob gene encoded a protein with a high degree of amino acid identity with the Mob proteins involved in conjugative mobilization and interplasmidic recombination of pTB913 and pUB110. The host range of pIP823 was broad and included L. monocytogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, S. aureus, Bacillus subtilis, and Escherichia coli. In all these species, pIP823 replicated by generating single-stranded DNA and was stable. Conjugative mobilization of pIP823 was obtained by self-transferable plasmids between L. monocytogenes and E. faecalis, between L. monocytogenes and E. coli, and between strains of E. coli, and by the streptococcal conjugative transposon Tn1545 from L. monocytogenes to E. faecalis, and from L. monocytogenes and E. faecalis to E. coli. These data indicate that the gene flux observed in nature from gram-positive to gram-negative bacteria can occur by conjugative mobilization. Our results suggest that dissemination of trimethoprim resistance in Listeria spp. and acquisition of other antibiotic resistance determinants in this species can be anticipated.
TI  - The carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase of Pyrococcus furiosus is enzymologically and  structurally a carbamate kinase.
AB  - The hyperthermophiles Pyrococcus furiosus and Pyrococcus abyssi make pyrimidines  and arginine from carbamoyl phosphate (CP) synthesized by an enzyme that differs from other carbamoyl-phosphate synthetases and that resembles carbamate kinase (CK) in polypeptide mass, amino acid sequence, and oligomeric organization. This enzyme was reported to use ammonia, bicarbonate, and two ATP molecules as carbamoyl-phosphate synthetases to make CP and to exhibit bicarbonatedependent ATPase activity. We have reexamined these findings using the enzyme of P. furiosus expressed in Escherichia coli from the corresponding gene cloned in a plasmid. We show that the enzyme uses chemically made carbamate rather than ammonia and bicarbonate and catalyzes a reaction with the stoichiometry and equilibrium that are typical for CK. Furthermore, the enzyme catalyzes actively full reversion of the CK reaction and exhibits little bicarbonate-dependent ATPase. In addition, it cross-reacts with antibodies raised against CK from Enterococcus faecium, and its three-dimensional structure, judged by x-ray crystallography of enzyme crystals, is very similar to that of CK. Thus, the enzyme is, in all respects other than its function in vivo, a CK. Because in other organisms the function of CK is to make ATP from ADP and CP derived from arginine catabolism, this is the first example of using CK for making rather than using CP. The reasons for this use and the adaptation of the enzyme to this new function are discussed.
TI  - New derivatives of benzimidazole and their antimicrobial activity.
AB  - Azolium salts and neutral 2-aryl derivatives of benzimidazole, benzothiazole and  benzoxazole were synthesized and compounds were identified by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy and microanalytical methods. In this work the salts 1 and the neutral compounds 2 were evaluated for their in vitro antimicrobial activity against standard strains: Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29212), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 29213), Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853), Candida albicans and Candida tropicals. The compounds 1f, 1g, 1l, 1m, 1n, 2a, 2b, 2c, 2e, 2f showed antimicrobial activity against Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29212), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 29213), Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853), Candida albicans and Candida tropicals, with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) ranging between 50 to 200 mg/mL. Compounds 1f, 1g, 1l, lm, 2b, 2c showed the highest activity. Benzothiazolium and benzoxazolium salts were more active than 1,3-disubstituted benzimidazolium salts and neutral 2-substituted benzimidazole, benzothiazole and benzoxazole derivatives.
TI  - Survival of Enterococcus faecalis in mouse peritoneal macrophages.
AB  - Enterococcus faecalis was tested for the ability to persist in mouse peritoneal macrophages in two separate studies. In the first study, the intracellular survival of serum-passaged E. faecalis 418 and two isogenic mutants [cytolytic strain FA2-2(pAM714) and non-cytolytic strain FA2-2(pAM771)] was compared with that of Escherichia coli DH5alpha by infecting BALB/c mice intraperitoneally and then monitoring the survival of the bacteria within lavaged peritoneal macrophages over a 72-h period. All E. faecalis isolates were serum passaged to enhance the production of cytolysin. E. faecalis 418, FA2-2(pAM714), and FA2-2(pAM771) survived at a significantly higher level (P = 0.0001) than did E. coli DH5alpha at 24, 48, and 72 h. Internalized E. faecalis 418, FA2-2(pAM714), and FA2-2(pAM771) decreased 10-, 55-, and 31-fold, respectively, over the 72-h infection period, while internalized E. coli DH5alpha decreased 20, 542-fold. The difference in the rate of survival of E. faecalis strains and E. coli DH5alpha was most prominent between 6 and 48 h postinfection (P = 0.0001); however, no significant difference in killing was observed between 48 and 72 h postinfection. In the second study, additional E. faecalis strains from clinical sources, including DS16C2, MGH-2, OG1X, and the cytolytic strain FA2-2(pAM714), were compared with the nonpathogenic gram-positive bacterium, Lactococcus lactis K1, for the ability to survive in mouse peritoneal macrophages. In these experiments, the E. faecalis strains and L. lactis K1 were grown in brain heart infusion (BHI) broth to ensure that there were equal quantities of injected bacteria. E. faecalis FA2-2(pAM714), DS16C2, MGH-2, and OG1X survived significantly better (P < 0.0001) than did L. lactis K1 at each time point. L. lactis K1 was rapidly destroyed by the macrophages, and by 24 h postinfection, viable L. lactis could not be recovered. E. faecalis FA2-2(pAM714), DS16C2, MGH-2, and OG1X declined at an equivalent rate over the 72-h infection period, and there was no significant difference in survival or rate of decline among the strains. E. faecalis FA2-2(pAM714), MGH-2, DS16C2, and OG1X exhibited an overall decrease of 25-, 55-, 186-, and 129-fold respectively, between 6 and 72 h postinfection. The overall reduction by 1.3 to 2.27 log units is slightly higher than that seen for serum-passaged E. faecalis strains and may be attributable to the higher level of uptake of serum-passaged E. faecalis than of E. faecalis grown in BHI broth. Electron microscopy of infected macrophages revealed that E. faecalis 418 was present within an intact phagocytic vacuole at 6 h postinfection but that by 24 h the infected macrophages were disorganized, the vacuolar membrane was degraded, and the bacterial cells had entered the cytoplasm. Macrophage destruction occurred by 48 h, and the bacteria were released. In conclusion, the results of these experiments indicate that E. faecalis can persist for an extended period in mouse peritoneal macrophages.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (1997). II. Background of patients].
AB  - Clinical background was investigated on patients with urinary tract infections (UTIs) from whom 603 bacterial strains were isolated in 9 hospitals during the period from June, 1997 through May, 1998. 1. Distribution of age and sex of patients and type of infections Among males, those with ages less than 50 years were only 12.5%, and those in the 70's were most frequent (33.3%). Among females, those with ages less than 20 years were only 3.4%, and those in the 60's were the most frequent (22.9%). With regard to type of infections, more than a half of infections among males with ages 50 years or older were of complicated types, but most of infections among females were of uncomplicated types, especially those of ages less than 50 years. 2. Ages of patients and types of pathogens Escherichia coli was the most frequently isolated in uncomplicated and complicated UTIs without indwelling catheters. In complicated UTIs with indwelling catheters, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus faecalis had mainly detected, they had no relationship with ages. 3. Effect of antibiotic use on isolation frequencies of pathogens Use of antibiotics decreased pathogens isolated from patients with uncomplicated UTIs drastically (183 isolates before antibiotics compared to 13 after). Even isolated pathogens from patients with complicated UTIs decreased drastically with the use of antibiotics when indwelling catheters were not in use (175 isolates before antibiotics compared to 53 after), but when indwelling catheters were in use, antibiotics slightly decreased (109 isolates before antibiotics compared to 70 after). 4. Surgical procedures and types of causative organisms for UTIs E. faecalis were more isolated when a surgical procedures were used, and E. coli were more isolated when, they were not used in uncomplicated and complicated UTIs without indwelling catheters. In complicated UTIs with indwelling catheters, E. coli and E. faecalis were more isolated when a surgical procedures were used, and P. aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus were more isolated when they were not used.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (1997). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The frequencies of isolation and susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents were investigated on 560 bacterial strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 9 hospitals during the period of June 1997 to May 1998. Of the above bacterial isolates, Gram-positive bacteria accounted for 29.3% and a majority of them were Enterococcus faecalis. Gram-negative bacteria accounted for 70.7% and most of them were Escherichia coli. Susceptibilities of several isolated bacteria to antimicrobial agents were as followed; 1. Enterococcus faecalis Ampicillin (ABPC) showed the highest activity against E. faecalis isolated from patients with UTIs. Its MIC90 was 1 microgram/ml. Imipenem (IPM) and vancomycin (VCM) were also active with the MIC90s of 2 micrograms/ml. The others had low activities with the MIC90s of 16 micrograms/ml or above. 2. Staphylococcus aureus including MRSA VCM and arbekacin (ABK) showed the highest activities against both S. aureus and MRSA isolated from patients with UTIs. The MIC90s of them were 1 microgram/ml. The others except minocycline (MINO) had low activities with the MIC90s of 32 micrograms/ml or above. More than a half of S. aureus strains (including MRSA) showed high susceptibilities to gentamicin (GM) and MINO, the MIC50s of 0.25 microgram/ml or 0.5 microgram/ml. 3. Enterobacter cloacae IPM showed the highest activity against E. cloacae. The MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 1 microgram/ml. The MIC90s of ciprofloxacin (CPFX) and tosufloxacin (TFLX) were 1 microgram/ml, the MIC90s of amikacin (AMK) and ofloxacin (OFLX) were 4 micrograms/ml, the MIC90 of GM was 16 micrograms/ml. Among E. cloacae strains, those with low susceptibilities to quinolones have decreased in 1997, compared with those in 1996. But the other drugs were not so active in 1997 as 1996. 4. Escherichia coli All drugs except penicillins were active against E. coli with the MIC90s of 8 micrograms/ml or below. Particularly, flomoxef (FMOX), cefmenoxime (CMX), cefpirome (CPR), cefozopran (CZOP), IPM, CPFX and TFLX showed the highest activities against E. coli with the MIC90s of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. 5. Klebsiella pneumoniae K. pneumoniae was susceptible to almost all the drugs except penicillins. Carumonam (CRMN) had the strongest activity with the MICs for all strains equal to or lower than 0.125 microgram/ml. FMOX, CPR, CZOP, CPFX and TFLX were also active with the MIC90s of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. The MIC90s of quinolones had changed into a better state in 1997, compared with those in 1996. 6. Proteus mirabilis Almost all the drugs except ABPC and MINO showed high activities against P. mirabilis. CMX, ceftazidime (CAZ), latamoxef (LMOX), CPR, cefixime (CFIX), cefpodoxime (CPDX) and CRMN showed the highest activities against P. mirabilis. The MICs of them for all strains were equal to or lower than 0.125 microgram/ml. CPFX and TFLX were also active with the MIC90s of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. 7. Pseudomonas aeruginosa The MIC90 of GM was 8 micrograms/ml, the MIC90s of AMK, IPM and meropenem (MEPM) were 16 micrograms/ml. The others were not so active against P. aeruginosa with the MIC90s of 32 micrograms/ml or above. The MIC90s of quinolones had changed into a lower state in 1997, compared with those in 1996. 8. Serratia marcescens IPM showed the highest activity against S. marcescens. Its MIC90 was 2 micrograms/ml. GM was also active with the MIC90 of 4 micrograms/ml. The MIC90s of the others were 16 micrograms/ml or above. The MIC50s of CRMN was 0.125 microgram/ml or below, the MIC50s of CPR and CZOP were 0.25 microgram/ml.
TI  - Bloodstream infections in a neonatal intensive-care unit: 12 years' experience with an antibiotic control program.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence of gram-positive coccal (GPC), gram-negative  bacillary (GNB), and fungal blood-stream infections (BSIs) during a 12-year period in which a consistent antibiotic treatment protocol was in place; to evaluate the efficacy of these antibiotic policies in relation to treatment, to the emergence of bacterial or fungal resistance, and to the occurrence of infection outbreaks or epidemics. STUDY DESIGN: Case series. METHODS: Demographic, clinical, and bacteriological information from 363 infants born during 1986 through 1991 and 1992 through 1997 who developed 433 blood-culture-proven BSIs was analyzed. Early-onset BSIs were defined as those infections discovered within 48 hours of birth, and late-onset BSIs as those that occurred thereafter. Suspected early-onset BSIs were treated with ampicillin and gentamicin, and suspected late-onset BSIs with vancomycin and gentamicin. Antibiotics were changed on the basis of organism antimicrobial susceptibility. RESULTS: Early-onset BSIs were noted in 52 of 21,336 live births and 40 of 20,402 live births during 1986 through 1991 and 1992 through 1997, respectively. GPC (83% due to group B streptococcus [GBS]) accounted for approximately one half of early-onset BSI cases and GNB (68% Enterobacteriaceae) for the remainder. Early-onset GBS declined from 24 to 11 cases (P=.04) and late-onset BSI increased from 111 to 230 cases (P<.01) from the first to the last study period. Sixty-eight percent of late-onset BSIs were due to GPC (primarily coagulase-negative Staphylococcus), 18% to GNB, and 14% to fungus. Over the study period, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from the newborn intensivecare unit (unlike those strains from other hospital units) remained fully susceptible to ceftazidime and gentamicin. Although the hospitalwide prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus increased, all 17 newborn BSI cases were due to methicillin-sensitive strains. Prevalence of methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococcus increased, although all strains remained vancomycin-susceptible, as did the 16 Enterococcus faecalis isolates. All fungi recovered (from 48 patients) were susceptible to amphotericin. CONCLUSION: We observed a decrease in the prevalence of early-onset BSIs due to GBS and an increase in late-onset BSIs due to GPC, GNB, and fungi. The combination of ampicillin and gentamicin for suspected early-onset BSIs and vancomycin and gentamicin for late-onset BSIs has been successful for treatment of individual patients without the occurrence of infection outbreaks or the emergence of resistance. Controlled antibiotic programs and periodic evaluations based on individual unit and not on hospitalwide antibiograms are advisable.
TI  - An operon that confers UV resistance by evoking the SOS mutagenic response in streptococcal conjugative transposon Tn5252.
AB  - Streptococcus pneumoniae Rx1 is capable of repairing lesions caused by DNA-damaging agents in an error-free manner but lacks a UV-inducible error-prone repair system due to the absence of chromosomally encoded UmuDC-like proteins. We have identified an operon-like structure 8 kb from the left end of the pneumococcal conjugative transposon Tn5252 that confers SOS function in the host cells. DNA sequence analysis of this region revealed the presence of four open reading frames (ORFs). The deduced amino acid sequence of one of them, ORF13, which is capable of encoding a protein of 49.7 kDa, showed significant homology to UmuC, MucB, and other proteins involved in the SOS response. The carboxy-terminal region of another, ORF14, which is predicted to encode a 26-kDa polypeptide, shared similarity with UmuD- and MucA-like proteins that carry the amino acid residues recognized by the activated RecA* protein for proteolytic cleavage. The presence of plasmids carrying subcloned DNA from this region was found to restore UV-inducible mutagenic repair of chromosomal DNA in Escherichia coli cells defective in error-prone repair as well as in pneumococcus and Enterococcus faecalis UV202. Mutations within ORF13 abolished UV-induced mutagenesis but did not affect the conjugal transposition of the element.
TI  - Gatifloxacin (AM-1155, CG 5501) susceptibility testing interpretive criteria and  quality control guidelines for dilution and disk (5-microgram) diffusion methods. The Quality Control Study Group.
AB  - Gatifloxacin (formerly AM-1155 and CG5501), a new 8-methoxy fluoroquinolone, has  an expanded spectrum of activity against Gram-positive cocci and some anaerobic bacteria. This compound was tested against 600 recent clinical strains of rapidly growing aerobic species to establish susceptibility testing interpretive criteria for the reference broth microdilution and standardized disk (5-microgram) diffusion methods of the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS). These strains included 285 Enterobacteriaceae (17 species), 165 staphylococci, 49 enterococci, and 101 nonfermentative Gram-negative bacilli. Based on achievable serum levels with projected gatifloxacin dosing regimens, MIC break points of < or = 2 micrograms/mL (> or = 18 mm) for susceptibility and > or = 8 micrograms/mL (< or = 14 mm) for resistance were selected. The absolute agreement between tests was 94.3% with no very major false-resistant errors. The quality control ranges (MIC and zone diameters) for the NCCLS recommended strains were determined in a nine-laboratory NCCLS protocol as follows: Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 = 0.008-0.03 microgram/mL and 31-37 mm; Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212 = 0.12-1 microgram/mL; Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 = 0.5-2 micrograms/ml and 21-27 mm; Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 = 27-33 mm and S. aureus ATCC 29213 = 0.03-0.12 microgram/mL. Gatifloxacin appears to be a promising new fluoroquinolone with acceptable susceptibility testing methods for routine clinical laboratory use.
TI  - Stool microflora in extremely low birthweight infants.
AB  - AIM: To serially characterise aerobic and anaerobic stool microflora in extremely low birthweight infants and to correlate colonisation patterns with clinical risk factors. METHODS: Stool specimens from 29 infants of birthweight <1000 g were collected on days 10, 20, and 30 after birth. Quantitative aerobic and anaerobic cultures were performed. RESULTS: By day 30, predominant species were Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterbacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus haemolyticus. Lactobacillus and Bifidobacteria spp were identified in only one infant. In breast milk fed (but not in formula fed) infants, the total number of bacterial species/stool specimen increased significantly with time (2.50 (SE 0.34) on day 10; 3.13 (0.38) on day 20; 4.27 (0.45) on day 30) as did quantitative bacterial counts; Gram negative species accounted for most of the increase. On day 30, significant inverse correlations were found between days of previous antibiotic treatment and number of bacterial species (r=0.491) and total organisms/g of stool (r=0.482). Gestational age, birthweight, maternal antibiotic or steroid treatment, prolonged rupture of the membranes, and mode of delivery did not seem to affect colonisation patterns. CONCLUSIONS: The gut of extremely low birthweight infants is colonised by a paucity of bacterial species. Breast milking and reduction of antibiotic exposure are critical to increasing fecal microbial diversity.
TI  - Short-course ceftriaxone therapy in spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.
AB  - Forty patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, three of whom had complicating acute hepatitis syndrome, eight late-onset hepatic failure, and 29 with cirrhosis, were treated with ceftriaxone 2 g intravenously once daily for 5 days. Ascitic fluid culture was positive in 28 patients, with Escherichia coli and Klebsiella as common isolates. All the bacteria isolated were sensitive to ceftriaxone except Enterococcus faecalis, which was isolated in a cirrhotic patient. All culture-positive patients sensitive to ceftriaxone showed bacteriological cure and 26 (65%) patients showed cytological cure after 48 hours of treatment. A total of 95% were cured of their infection after 5 days of treatment. Twelve (30%) patients died during hospitalisation after documented cure of their spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (renal failure, gastrointestinal bleed and cerebral oedema were the primary causes of death). Infection-related mortality due to Pseudomonas septicaemia was seen in one cirrhotic patient.
TI  - Cation movements at alkaline pH in bacteria growing without respiration.
AB  - The respiratory chain has a central role in energy metabolism as a generator of a proton motive force in aerobic bacteria. In contrast, Enterococcus hirae (formerly Streptococcus faecalis), which lacks the respiratory chain, generates this proton gradient via a F-type H+ ATPase, but it works only at a pH below 8; no significant proton motive force is generated at a pH above 8. An Escherichia coli mutant deficient in both the respiratory chain and the H+ ATPase grew with a negligible proton motive force within the wide range of medium pH. It has been suggested that both E. hirae and E. coli are able to grow even when the cytoplasm is alkalinized beyond pH 8. These observations lead to the conclusion that bacteria can survive without operating cation transport systems driven by a proton motive force at alkaline pH. The activity of any transport system with optimum pH around neutrality should decline when both the outside and inside of cells are alkalinized. Thus, changes in transport systems as well as cellular metabolism may be essential for bacterial adaptation to changes in environmental pH.

TI  - Vancomycin derivatives that inhibit peptidoglycan biosynthesis without binding D-Ala-D-Ala.
AB  - Vancomycin is an important drug for the treatment of Gram-positive bacterial infections. Resistance to vancomycin has begun to appear, posing a serious public health threat. Vancomycin analogs containing modified carbohydrates are very active against resistant microorganisms. Results presented here show that these carbohydrate derivatives operate by a different mechanism than vancomycin; moreover, peptide binding is not required for activity. It is proposed that carbohydrate-modified vancomycin compounds are effective against resistant bacteria because they interact directly with bacterial proteins involved in the transglycosylation step of cell wall biosynthesis. These results suggest new strategies for designing glycopeptide antibiotics that overcome bacterial resistance.
TI  - Characterization and heterologous expression of the genes encoding enterocin a production, immunity, and regulation in Enterococcus faecium DPC1146.
AB  - Enterocin A is a small, heat-stable, antilisterial bacteriocin produced by Enterococcus faecium DPC1146. The sequence of a 10, 879-bp chromosomal region containing at least 12 open reading frames (ORFs), 7 of which are predicted to play a role in enterocin biosynthesis, is presented. The genes entA, entI, and entF encode the enterocin A prepeptide, the putative immunity protein, and the induction factor prepeptide, respectively. The deduced proteins EntK and EntR resemble the histidine kinase and response regulator proteins of two-component signal transducing systems of the AgrC-AgrA type. The predicted proteins EntT and EntD are homologous to ABC (ATP-binding cassette) transporters and accessory factors, respectively, of several other bacteriocin systems and to proteins implicated in the signal-sequence-independent export of Escherichia coli hemolysin A. Immediately downstream of the entT and entD genes are two ORFs, the product of one of which, ORF4, is very similar to the product of the yteI gene of Bacillus subtilis and to E. coli protease IV, a signal peptide peptidase known to be involved in outer membrane lipoprotein export. Another potential bacteriocin is encoded in the opposite direction to the other genes in the enterocin cluster. This putative bacteriocin-like peptide is similar to LafX, one of the components of the lactacin F complex. A deletion which included one of two direct repeats upstream of the entA gene abolished enterocin A activity, immunity, and ability to induce bacteriocin production. Transposon insertion upstream of the entF gene also had the same effect, but this mutant could be complemented by exogenously supplied induction factor. The putative EntI peptide was shown to be involved in the immunity to enterocin A. Cloning of a 10.5-kb amplicon comprising all predicted ORFs and regulatory regions resulted in heterologous production of enterocin A and induction factor in Enterococcus faecalis, while a four-gene construct (entAITD) under the control of a constitutive promoter resulted in heterologous enterocin A production in both E. faecalis and Lactococcus lactis.
TI  - Microbiological safety of essential oils used in complementary therapies and the  activity of these compounds against bacterial and fungal pathogens.
AB  - To determine the safety of plant essential oils we determined the sterility of eight of these products obtained from retail outlets. In addition, the ability of oils to support the growth of fungal and bacterial pathogens was examined. The antimicrobial activity of these products against seven bacterial species and Candida albicans was also investigated. All oils and their respective carriers were sterile. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were unable to survive in oils for longer than 6 h, whereas C. albicans was able to survive, but not multiply, in ylang ylang oil for at least 48 h.

TI  - Microbiological and inflammatory effects of murine recombinant interleukin-10 in  two models of polymicrobial peritonitis in rats.
AB  - A protective effect of interleukin-10 (IL-10) against the development of lethal shock has been demonstrated in various animal models. In contrast, the immunosuppressant properties of this mediator have been minimally evaluated in low-mortality models of infections. The clinical, microbiological, and inflammatory effects of murine recombinant IL-10 (mrIL-10) therapy were evaluated in two models of peritonitis in rats, which differed in the degree of severity of peritoneal inflammation 3 days after inoculation of Escherichia coli and Bacteroides fragilis with or without Enterococcus faecalis. The severity of the disease remained unchanged compared to that in control animals. A dose-related decrease in the peritoneal phagocyte count was observed in the treated groups compared to the counts in control animals. The subsequent experiments were performed exclusively in the mixed gram-positive-gram negative model, which exhibits an intense and prolonged inflammatory response with similar criteria. The early effects of mrIL-10 (evaluated 6 h after inoculation), repeated injections of mrIL-10 (four doses injected from 0 to 9 h after bacterial challenge), and pretreatment (two doses injected 6 and 3 h before inoculation) were evaluated. The clinical and microbiological parameters remained unchanged in the treated animals. Decreases in the peritoneal phagocyte count and the peritoneal concentration of tumor necrosis factor were observed following repeated injections of mrIL-10. In summary, our data suggest that mrIL-10 does not worsen the manifestations of sepsis. However, these results need to be confirmed in clinical practice.
TI  - Pyogenic liver abscess: a review of 10 years' experience in management.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Over the past 15 years, diagnostic and interventional radiology techniques have allowed accurate localization of liver abscesses and image-guided percutaneous drainage. This review examines whether these technical advances improve clinical results and discusses the selection of treatment for patients with liver abscesses. METHODS: Ninety-eight patients were treated for pyogenic liver abscess (PLA) at the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Sydney, between January 1987 and June 1997. The hospital records were examined and clinical presentation, laboratory, radiological and microbiological findings were recorded. Associations between these findings and failure of initial non-operative management were determined using odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals. Independent predictors were then determined by logistic regression. This analysis was repeated to determine factors associated with mortality. RESULTS: Cholelithiasis and previous hepatobiliary surgery were the most frequently identifiable causes of PLA, each responsible in 15 patients. All 98 patients were treated with intravenous antibiotics and in 13 patients this was the only therapy. Of the remaining 85 patients, six proceeded straight to laparotomy and 79 had percutaneous drainage, of whom 15 required subsequent laparotomy. Factors predicting failure of initial non-operative management were unresolving jaundice, renal impairment secondary to clinical deterioration, multiloculation of the abscess, rupture on presentation and biliary communication. The overall hospital mortality rate was 8%. CONCLUSION: Pyogenic liver abscess remains a disease with significant mortality. Image-guided percutaneous drainage is appropriate treatment for single unilocular PLA. Surgical drainage is more likely to be required in patients who have abscess rupture, incomplete percutaneous drainage or who have uncorrected primary pathology.
TI  - In vitro activities of aminomethyl-substituted analogs of novel tetrahydrofuranyl carbapenems.
AB  - CL 188,624, CL 190,294, and CL 191,121 are novel aminomethyl tetrahydrofuranyl (THF)-1 beta-methylcarbapenems. The in vitro antibacterial activities of these THF carbapenems were evaluated and compared with those of biapenem, imipenem, and meropenem against 554 recent clinical isolates obtained from geographically distinct medical centers across North America. The antibacterial activities of the THF carbapenems were equivalent to that of biapenem, and the THF carbapenems were slightly more active than imipenem and less active than meropenem against most of the members of the family Enterobacteriaceae but lacked significant activity against Pseudomonas isolates. In general, CL 191,121 was two- to fourfold more active than CL 188,624 and CL 190,294 against the staphylococcal and enterococcal isolates tested. CL 191,121 was twofold less active than imipenem against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci and was as activity as imipenem against Enterococcus faecalis isolates. Biapenem and meropenem were two- and fourfold less active than CL 191,121, respectively, against the methicillin-susceptible staphylococci and E. faecalis. All the carbapenems displayed equivalent good activities against the streptococci. Biapenem was slightly more active than the other carbapenems against Bacteroides fragilis isolates. Time-kill curve studies demonstrated that the THF carbapenems were bactericidal in 6 h against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus isolates. The postantibiotic effect exerted by CL 191,121 was comparable to or slightly longer than that of imipenem against isolates of S. aureus, E. coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae.
TI  - The role of various agents in chicken amyloid arthropathy.
AB  - The results of an inventory of field cases of amyloid arthropathy in chickens and of routine post-mortem recordings over a two years period are described. Studies were also performed to evaluate the amyloidogenic potential of arthrotropic bacterial species (Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Salmonella enteritidis) isolated from chickens as well as several Enterococcus faecalis isolates compared to the amyloidogenic E. faecalis isolate (previously isolated from amyloidotic joints). As chicken anemia virus was also isolated from amyloidotic joints of field cases, it was also screened for its amyloidogenic potential. In another experiment, Mycoplasma synoviae, inactivated E. faecalis isolate 6085.94, Freund's adjuvant and an arthrotropic reovirus field isolate were also screened for amyloidogenicity by intra-articular injection. These studies showed that the ability to elicit extensive amyloid arthropathy is reserved primarily to E. faecalis, but that this property is not common to every E. faecalis isolate. Intra-articular application of complete Freund's adjuvant led to the formation of extensive joint amyloid deposits. Of the other micro-organisms studied, S. aureus, S. enteritidis and E. coli were also able to cause joint amyloidosis, but in very small amounts. Inactivated E. faecalis, chicken anemia virus and reovirus did not cause amyloid arthropathy after intra-articular inoculation. This study is consistent with results of the analyses of previous field cases and of the induction of amyloid arthropathy in chickens, suggesting a considerable role for E. faecalis in this clinical-pathological entity. Finally, strain typing by analysis of chromosomal DNA restriction endonuclease digests by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) of amyloidogenic, non-amyloidogenic, amyloid-associated and other E. faecalis isolates from various origins showed that all amyloidogenic and amyloid-associated E. faecalis isolates had similar restriction digests, suggesting clonal spread.
TI  - Bactericidal action of 308 nm excimer-laser radiation: an in vitro investigation.
AB  - The aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of 308 nm excimer-laser radiation on bacterial growth. Six different bacterial strains (Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus faecalis, Lactococcis lactis, Salmonella typhimurium, and Deinococcus radiodurans) were exposed in vitro to various doses and energy densities of laser radiation. To exclude bacterial killing by supraphysiological heating, the temperature change in the samples during irradiation was measured. Extended antimicrobial effects of XeCl excimer-laser radiation depending on the time of radiation, the energy density of the laser beam, and the irradiated bacterial strain were observed. Reduction of bacterial growth is independent of temperature and not linked to any ablative tissue removal. In almost all cases, a 99.9% reduction of bacteria was reached by total radiation times < 100 ms. The proven antimicrobial effects of 308 nm excimer-laser radiation may be of significant clinical importance in endodontics and periodontology in the future.
TI  - The hprK gene of Enterococcus faecalis encodes a novel bifunctional enzyme: the HPr kinase/phosphatase.
AB  - The HPr kinase of Gram-positive bacteria is an ATP-dependent serine protein kinase, which phosphorylates the HPr protein of the bacterial phosphotransferase system (PTS) and is involved in the regulation of carbohydrate metabolism. The hprK gene from Enterococcus faecalis was cloned via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequenced. The deduced amino acid sequence was confirmed by microscale Edman degradation and mass spectrometry combined with collision-induced dissociation of tryptic peptides derived from the HPr kinase of E. faecalis. The gene was overexpressed in Escherichia coli, which does not contain any ATP-dependent HPr kinase or phosphatase activity. The homogeneous recombinant protein exhibits the expected HPr kinase activity as well as a P-Ser-HPr phosphatase activity, which was assumed to be a separate enzyme activity. The bifunctional HPr kinase/phosphatase acts preferentially as a kinase at high ATP levels of 2 mM occurring in glucose-metabolizing Streptococci. At low ATP levels, the enzyme hydrolyses P-Ser-HPr. In addition, high concentrations of phosphate present under starvation conditions inhibit the HPr kinase activity. Thus, a putative function of the enzyme may be to adjust the ratio of HPr and P-Ser-HPr according to the metabolic state of the cell; P-Ser-HPr is involved in carbon catabolite repression and regulates sugar uptake via the phosphotransferase system (PTS). Reinvestigation of the previously described Bacillus subtilis HPr kinase revealed that it also possesses P-Ser-HPr phosphatase activity. However, contrary to the E. faecalis enzyme, ATP alone was not sufficient to switch the phosphatase activity of the B. subtilis enzyme to the kinase activity. A change in activity of the B. subtilis HPr kinase was only observed when fructose-1,6-bisphosphate was also present.
TI  - Evaluation of the antimicrobial activity of a new super-oxidized water, Sterilox, for the disinfection of endoscopes.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of a new super-oxidized water, Sterilox, has been tested against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare, Mycobacterium chelonae, Escherichia coli (including type O157), Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus subtilis var niger spores, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans, poliovirus type 2 and human immunodeficiency virus HIV-1. Under clean conditions, freshly generated Sterilox was found to be highly active against all these micro-organisms giving a 5 log10 (99.999%) or greater reduction in two minutes or less.
TI  - In vitro activity of meropenem against common pathogenic bacteria isolated in Taiwan.
AB  - The in vitro antimicrobial activity of meropenem, in comparison with nine other antimicrobial agents, against 12 different common pathogenic bacteria were evaluated to know the susceptibility of common bacteria to meropenem in Taiwan. Meropenem was active against most Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and anaerobic bacteria, including methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cepacia, Acinetobacter baumannii, Haemophilus influenzae, and Bacteroides fragilis. For many of them, meropenem was the most active one in comparison with other broad-spectrum cephalosporins, aztreonam, imipenem, and ciprofloxacin. It is concluded that meropenem is a very active agent against most common pathogenic bacteria. It is uncommon for these common bacteria, except MRSA and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, to be resistant to meropenem in Taiwan, where a high prevalence of resistance to other antimicrobial agents was found in many of the common bacteria.
TI  - A sensitive and quick microplate method to determine the minimal inhibitory concentration of plant extracts for bacteria.
AB  - Agar diffusion techniques are used widely to assay plant extracts for antimicrobial activity, but there are problems associated with this technique. A micro-dilution technique was developed using 96-well microplates and tetrazolium salts to indicate bacterial growth. p-Iodonitrotetrazolium violet [0.2 mg/ml] gave better results than tetrazolium red or thiazolyl blue. The method is quick, worked well with Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli and with non-aqueous extracts from many different plants. The method gave reproducible results; required only 10-25 microliters of extract to determine minimal inhibitory concentrations, distinguished between microcidal and microstatic effects, and provided a permanent record of the results. Using S. aureus, and a Combretum molle extract, the technique was 32 times more sensitive than agar diffusion techniques and was not sensitive to culture age of the test organism up to 24 hours. The S. aureus culture could be stored up to 10 days in a cold room with little effect on the assay results. This method was useful in screening plants for antimicrobial activity and for the bioassay-guided isolation of antimicrobial compounds from plants. MIC values determined for sulfisoxazole, norfloxacin, gentamicin, and nitrofuratoin were similar to values indicated in the literature but values obtained with trimethroprim and ampicillin were higher with some bacteria.
TI  - Effect of compressed carbon dioxide on microbial cell viability.
AB  - In order to study the influence of compressed carbon dioxide, over a range of pressures (1.5 to 5.5 MPa) and exposure times (up to 7 h), on the survival of Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Enterococcus faecalis, a new pressurizable reactor system was conceived. Microbial cells were inoculated onto a solid hydrophilic medium and treated at room temperature; their sensitivities to inactivation varied greatly. The CO2 treatment had an enhanced efficiency in cell destruction when the pressure and the duration of exposure were increased. The effects of these parameters on the loss of viability was also studied by response-surface methodology. This study showed that a linear correlation exists between microbial inactivation and CO2 pressure and exposure time, and in it models were proposed which were adequate to predict the experimental values. The end point acidity was measured for all the samples in order to understand the mechanism of microbial inactivation. The pHs of the treated samples did not vary, regardless of the experimental conditions. Other parameters, such as water content and pressure release time, were also investigated.
TI  - The structure and function of HPr.
AB  - Histidine-containing phosphocarrier protein, HPr, was one of the early protein tertiary structures determined by two-dimensional 1H-NMR. Tertiary structures for HPrs from Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, and Staphylococcus aureus have been obtained by 1H NMR and the overall folding pattern of HPr is highly conserved, a betaalpha betabeta alphabeta alpha arrangement of three alpha-helices overlaying a four-stranded beta-sheet. High-resolution structures for HPrs from E. coli and B. subtilis have been obtained using 15N- and 13C-labeled proteins. The first application of NMR to the understanding of the structure and function of HPr was to describe the phosphohistidine isomer, Ndelta1-P-histidine in S. aureus phospho-HPr, and the unusual pKas of the His-15 side chain. The pKa values for the His-15 imidazole from more recent studies are 5.4 for HPr and 7.8 for phospho-HPr from E. coli, for example. A consensus description of the active site is proposed for HPr and phospho-HPr. In HPr, His-15 has a defined conformation and N-caps helix A, and is thus affected by the helix dipole. His-15 undergoes a small conformational change upon phosphorylation, a movement to allow the phosphoryl group to be positioned such that it forms hydrogen bonds with the main chain amide nitrogens of residue 16 (not conserved) and Arg-17. Interactions between residue 12 side chain (not conserved: asparagine, serine, and threonine) and His-15, and between the Arg-17 guanidinium group and the phosphoryl group, are either weak or transitory.
TI  - [Estimation of probiotics by infection model of infant rabbit with enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7].
AB  - We examined the preventative effect against enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7 (EHEC) infection in rabbits on administration of probiotics contained in Streptococcus faecalis, Clostridium butyricum and Bacillus mesentericus. The probiotics were administered to 5 days old Japanese white rabbits throughout the experiment. Inoculation of 10(6) colony forming units (CFUs) of EHEC per rabbit was tried 8 days after birth. Three days after EHEC inoculation, in the control group (not administered probiotics), diarrhea was observed in approximately 80% of the rabbits, on the other hand, in the group administered probiotics, rabbits showed diarrhea in 15%. In necropsy, the number of EHEC in the contents of the cecum and the number of attaching and effacing (AE) lesions were fewer in the probiotics group than in the control group. These results suggest that infant rabbits are useful as a colitis model for EHEC, and the probiotics are effective for the prevention of the growth of EHEC in the intestine and for diarrhea.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of ofloxacin in urine for 4 days after a single oral dose of 400 mg].
AB  - Antibacterial activity of ofloxacin in urine after a single oral dose of 400 mg was evaluated in ten healthy female volunteers. Urine was collected over six periods, i.e., 0-6 h, 6-12 h, 12-24 h, 24-48 h, 48-72 h, and 72-96 h postdose. Ofloxacin levels were assayed in all samples using a microbiological method and HPLC. Urinary ofloxacin MICs were determined for five bacterial strains recovered from urine, two E. coli strains of which one was susceptible and the other resistant to nalidixic acid (Nal-A), one Klebsiella pneumoniae resistant to nalidixic acid (Nal-B), one Staphylococcus saprophyticus strain, and one Enterococcus faecalis strain; MICs were 0.06, 0.25, 1, 0.25, and 2 mg/L, respectively. Mean urinary ofloxacin levels by the microbiological method during the six collection periods were 193.3 +/- 30.3, 138.1 +/- 31, 53.2 +/- 7.3, 8.3 +/- 0.8, 1.4 +/- 0.2, and 0.6 +/- 0.1 mg/L, respectively. HPLC provided similar results: 216.7 +/- 31.6, 130.7 +/- 20.5, 56.5 +/- 7.1, 8.3 +/- 0.9, 1.5 +/- 0.3, and 0.5 +/- 0.05 mg/L, respectively. Mean urinary ofloxacin excretion over 96 h was 67.4 +/- 3.6% of the dose by the microbiological method was 72.5 +/- 2.5% of the dose by HPLC. On the first day, bacteriostatic activity of urine against enterobacteria exceeded 32 and was greater than 8192 for the nalidixic acid-susceptible E. coli strain; on the next day, overall values were equal or greater than 8 for the nalidixic acid-resistant E. coli and K. pneumoniae strains. Bacteriostatic activity was equal to or greater than 32 for the S. saprophyticus strain during the first two days and equal to 8 on the first day and 4 on the second day for the E. faecalis strain.
TI  - Detection of a streptomycin/spectinomycin adenylyltransferase gene (aadA) in Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - Genes encoding streptomycin/spectinomycin adenylyltransferases [ANT(3")(9)] have  been reported to exist in gram-negative organisms and Staphylococcus aureus. During a study of high-level aminoglycoside resistance in enterococci, we encountered an isolate of Enterococcus faecalis that was streptomycin resistant but did not appear to contain the 6'-adenylyltransferase gene (aadE) when examined by PCR with specific primers. Phosphocellulose paper binding assays indicated the presence of an ANT(3")(9) enzyme. Streptomycin and spectinomycin MICs of 4,000 and 8,000 microg/ml, respectively, were observed for the isolate. PCR primers corresponding to a highly conserved region of the aadA gene were used to amplify a specific 284-bp product. The product hybridized with a digoxigenin-labeled PCR product from E. coli C600(pHP45Omega) known to contain the aadA gene. The aadA gene was transferred via filter matings from the E. faecalis donor to E. faecalis JH2-2. PCR primers designed for analysis of integrons were used to amplify a 1-kb product containing the aadA gene, which was cloned into the vector pCRII and transformed into Escherichia coli DH5-alpha competent cells. D-Rhodamine dye terminator cycle sequencing was used to determine the gene sequence, which was compared to previously reported sequences of aadA genes. We found the aadA gene in E. faecalis to be identical to the aadA genes reported by Sundstr om et al. for E. coli plasmid R6-5 (L. Sundstrom, P. Radstrom, G. Swedberg, and O. Skold, Mol. Gen. Genet. 213:191-201, 1988), by Fling et al. for the aadA within transposon Tn7 (M. E. Fling, J. Kopf, and C. Richards, Nucleic Acids Res. 13:7095-7106, 1985), and by Hollingshead and Vapnek for E. coli R538-1 (S. Hollingshead and D. Vapnek, Plasmid 13:17-30, 1985). Previous reports of the presence of the aadA gene in enterococci appear to be erroneous and probably describe an aadE gene, since the isolates were reported to be susceptible to spectinomycin.
TI  - Characterization of dihydrofolate reductase genes from trimethoprim-susceptible and trimethoprim-resistant strains of Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - Enterococci are usually susceptible in vitro to trimethoprim; however, high-level resistance (HLR) (MICs, >1,024 microg/ml) has been reported. We studied Enterococcus faecalis DEL, for which the trimethoprim MIC was >1,024 microg/ml. No transfer of resistance was achieved by broth or filter matings. Two different genes that conferred trimethoprim resistance when they were cloned in Escherichia coli (MICs, 128 and >1,024 microg/ml) were studied. One gene that coded for a polypeptide of 165 amino acids (MIC, 128 microg/ml for E. coli) was identical to dfr homologs that we cloned from a trimethoprim-susceptible E. faecalis strain, and it is presumed to be the intrinsic E. faecalis dfr gene (which causes resistance in E. coli when cloned in multiple copies); this gene was designated dfrE. The nucleotide sequence 5' to this dfr gene showed similarity to thymidylate synthetase genes, suggesting that the dfr and thy genes from E. faecalis are located in tandem. The E. faecalis gene that conferred HLR to trimethoprim in E. coli, designated dfrF, codes for a predicted polypeptide of 165 amino acids with 38 to 64% similarity with other dihydrofolate reductases from gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. The nucleotide sequence 5' to dfrF did not show similarity to the thy sequences. A DNA probe for dfrF hybridized under high-stringency conditions only to colony lysates of enterococci for which the trimethoprim MIC was >1,024 microg/ml; there was no hybridization to plasmid DNA from the strain of origin. To confirm that this gene causes trimethoprim resistance in enterococci, we cloned it into the integrative vector pAT113 and electroporated it into RH110 (E. faecalis OG1RF::Tn916DeltaEm) (trimethoprim MIC, 0.5 microg/ml), which resulted in RH110 derivatives for which the trimethoprim MIC was >1, 024 microg/ml. These results indicate that dfrF is an acquired but probably chromosomally located gene which is responsible for in vitro HLR to trimethoprim in E. faecalis.
TI  - Interference in initial adhesion of uropathogenic bacteria and yeasts to silicone rubber by a Lactobacillus acidophilus biosurfactant.
AB  - The ability of the Lactobacillus acidophilus RC14 biosurfactant 'surlactin' to inhibit the initial adhesion of various uropathogenic bacteria and two yeast strains to silicone rubber was investigated in a parallel-plate flow chamber in filter-sterilised pooled human urine. A parallel-plate flow chamber with a silicone rubber bottom plate was filled with a 1.0 mg/ml biosurfactant solution for adsorption overnight (18 h). Subsequently, the adhesion of the bacterial or yeast cells from a urine suspension under low flow (shear rate 15 s(-1)) was followed in situ by automated image analysis. Control tests were with untreated silicone rubber. Initial deposition rates and numbers of adhering cells after 4 h of flow were determined. Surlactin layers caused a marked inhibition of the initial deposition rates and adhesion numbers after 4 h for the majority of the bacteria (11 of 15 strains tested) and this inhibition was particularly effective against Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Although the initial deposition rates of the two Candida albicans strains were reduced by c. 50% in comparison with the controls, the numbers of yeast cells adhering after 4 h were similar.
TI  - Effect of nutrient composition on the in vitro growth of urogenital lactobacilli  and uropathogens.
AB  - Previous clinical studies have shown that nutrients and probiotic agents can alter the composition of the vaginal flora. The present in vitro study has shown that uropathogens have a growth advantage over lactobacilli, but potentially there are natural substances that could be applied vaginally to stimulate lactobacilli growth to the detriment of the pathogens. When chemically defined medium representative of vaginal fluid at pH 5.5 was supplemented with skim milk, it acted as a better substrate for Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1 than for uropathogenic bacteria and Candida albicans. Lactobacillus MRS medium, even at pH 4.5, supports the growth of pathogens, but when supplemented with ascorbic acid or EDTA, Lactobacillus growth was significantly higher. When L. rhamnosus GR-1 was coincubated in a combined nutrient composition of vitamins and lactose, it survived better than Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis. These in vitro results provide a basis for testing nutritional supplements to alter the urogenital flora in an attempt to enhance restoration and maintenance of a normal disease-free state.
TI  - The preliminary isolation of several antibacterial compounds from Combretum erythrophyllum (Combretaceae).
AB  - Freeze dried ground leaves of Combretum erythrophyllum were extracted with different extractants to determine if they contain inhibitors of pathogenic bacteria. Acetone yielded the most compounds inhibiting the growth of Staphylococcus aureus using bioautography of thin layer chromatography plates. Acetone also extracted many different compounds and group separation was attempted by solid phase extraction on reverse and normal phase silica gel. Both techniques separated the bioactive components to a degree. The best group separation results, however, were obtained using liquid/liquid extraction. The six fractions obtained inhibited the four test organisms to different degrees. S. aureus was the most sensitive (100%) followed by Enterococcus faecalis (36%), Escherichia coli (11%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (3%). With S. aureus as test organism, the chloroform soluble fraction contained by far the largest quantity of inhibiting components (100%), followed by the fractions soluble in water (23%), 35% methanol in water (18%), butanol (5%), carbon tetrachloride (2%) and hexane (traces). The lowest minimum inhibitory concentration for S. aureus was 0.05 mg/ml at this stage of purification compared to MIC values of 0.08 and 0.16 mg/ml for ampicillin and chloramphenicol. There were at least 14 different inhibitors with a wide range of polarities present in the different fractions. The polar components apparently did not contain polysaccharides and were probably basic according to the chromatographic behaviour.
TI  - Streptococcus pyogenes protein F promotes invasion of HeLa cells.
AB  - Although the Gram-positive bacterium Streptococcus pyogenes (group A streptococcus) has been considered an extracellular pathogen which adheres to human mucosal epithelium, the streptococcus possesses invasive capacity for cultured human epithelial cells. This study provides genetic and functional evidence supporting the conclusion that protein F is capable of mediating entry of S. pyogenes into HeLa cells. Using Tn916 insertion mutagenesis or an isogenic S. pyogenes strain with a defined mutation in the gene encoding protein F (prtF), it was observed that the invasive capacity was affected by the levels of surface-exposed protein F, but not by those of M protein. In addition, heterologous expression of protein F on Enterococcus faecalis conferred upon the bacteria an efficient invasive phenotype. Several assays demonstrated that both the fibronectin-binding domains of protein F, UR and RD2, were involved in host-cell invasion. In addition, coinfection experiments of HeLa cells with S. pyogenes and an Escherichia coli K-12 strain expressing an afimbrial adhesin AFA-I showed that the uptake of S. pyogenes did not permit internalization of the E. coli cells.
TI  - Nonculturable Enterococcus faecalis cells are metabolically active and capable of resuming active growth.
AB  - Entry into the viable but nonculturable (VNC) state is a survival mechanism that  bacteria can adopt when they find themselves in an adverse environment. When in this state, bacteria are still viable but are unable to form colonies on growth medium. The possibility of Gram-positive species entering the VNC state when environmental conditions are adverse and remaining viable and capable of resuming active growth is demonstrated for the first time in this study by using exponential-phase cultures of Enterococcus faecalis inoculated in filtered, sterilized water from Lake Garada (Italy). Over the 60-day study, the number of total cells stained with a fluorescent or counted with a Coulter Counter remained constant, while the number of cells capable of forming colonies on Tryptic Soy Agar (TSA) declined rapidly from 10(6) CFU/ml on day 0 to 10(3) CFU/ml on day 4. On day 14 no colonies could be observed when 50 ml of inoculated lake water were plated. E. faecalis cells conserved their viability while in the VNC state, as can be demonstrated by active uptake of amino acids, which are also incorporated into proteins, and by continuous detection of E. faecalis specific DNA by PCR throughout the experiment. The possibility of revival of the E. faecalis cells in the VNC state when returned to conditions supporting its cell growth has also been demonstrated. The data obtained in this study lend further support to recent criticisms of the traditional methods used to evaluate water quality based on plate counts, assessing fecal contamination indicators such as Escherichia coli and fecal streptococci.
TI  - Enterococcus-associated encephalomalacia in one-week-old chicks.
AB  
TI  - Isolation of a derivative of Escherichia coli-Enterococcus faecalis shuttle vector pAM401 temperature sensitive for maintenance in E. faecalis and its use in evaluating the mechanism of pAD1 par-dependent plasmid stabilization.
AB  - A derivative of the Escherichia coli-Enterococcus faecalis shuttle vector pAM401  was isolated by mutagenesis in an E. coli mutator strain. This plasmid, designated pAM401ts, was more than an order of magnitude less stable at 38 degreesC than at 30 degreesC in the E. faecalis host strain JH2-2. The E. faecalis plasmid pAD1-encoded par stability locus was cloned onto pAM401ts, and its effects on plasmid stability and host cell viability were assessed. It was found that par stabilized pAM401ts at 38 degreesC but also caused a substantial drop in cell viability three to four generations after a temperature shift from 30 to 38 degreesC. After a maximum viability drop of 94%, culture growth recovered as plasmid-free cells began to accumulate. Provision of excess RNAII, the putative par antidote, in trans attenuated cell killing. These characteristics support a postsegregational killing mechanism for par-mediated plasmid stabilization.
TI  - In vitro susceptibility testing and quality control parameters for sarafloxacin (A-56620): a fluoroquinolone used for treatment and control of colibacillosis in poultry. Quality Control Study Group.
AB  - Sarafloxacin (formerly A-56620) is a fluoroquinolone recently introduced into veterinary practice for the therapy of colibacillosis and other indicated infections. Sarafloxacin was noted to be very active and comparable to ciprofloxacin and enrofloxacin for inhibiting 823 strains from a wide variety of species at < or = 1 or < or = 2 micrograms/mL. In vitro susceptibility tests for sarafloxacin using National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) methods were also studied and interpretive criteria for Escherichia coli-associated colibacillosis isolates were proposed: susceptible at < or = 0.06 microgram/mL (> or = 25 mm) and resistant at > or = 0.25 microgram/mL (< or = 21 mm). Sarafloxacin agar dilution MIC results were approximately one log2 dilution higher than broth microdilution endpoints. The interpretive criteria demonstrated a low error rate of 5.9%, with a very major rate of only 0.5% (correlation coefficient between methods = 0.94). Quality control trials in six laboratories established MIC and zone diameter (5-microgram disk) limits for the NCCLS recommended strains: for the broth microdilution test, E. coli ATCC 25922 = 0.008 to 0.03 microgram/mL, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 = 0.12 to 1 microgram/mL, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212 = 0.5 to 2 micrograms/mL, and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213 = 0.06 to 0.25 microgram/mL; and for the disk diffusion test, E. coli ATCC 25922 = 30 to 36 mm, S. aureus ATCC 25923 = 25 to 30 mm, and P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 = 23 to 29 mm. These criteria for in vitro tests with sarafloxacin should enable the longitudinal monitoring of its activity against the indicated pathogens and allow detection of emerging resistant populations that may necessitate altered dosing regimens.
TI  - Regulation of the Enterococcus faecalis pAD1-related sex pheromone response: analyses of traD expression and its role in controlling conjugation functions.
AB  - The Enterococcus faecalis haemolysin plasmid pAD1 (60 kb) confers a conjugative mating response to an octapeptide sex pheromone (cAD1) secreted by plasmid-free strains. The response involves two plasmid-borne regulatory determinants: traE1, whose product positively regulates all or most conjugation-related structural genes; and traA, whose product negatively regulates traE1 by controlling transcriptional readthrough of an upstream termination site (TTS1/TTS2). TraA binds to the promoter region of iad, which encodes a pheromone-inhibitor peptide, iAD1; and TTS1/TTS2 tightly terminates transcription arriving from this promoter during the uninduced state. A determinant, traD, appearing to encode a small peptide (23 amino acids), is located just downstream of iad and is in the opposite orientation. Transcripts of traD were identified and found to be present at a relatively high level in cells not expressing conjugation functions; the amount of RNA was greatly reduced, however, upon induction of the pheromone response. The decrease in traD RNA was not a consequence of the induced activity of TraE1, as it also occurred in a traE1 insertion mutant. A mutation in traD that would eliminate translation but that did not affect transcription had no apparent effect on the cell phenotype, indicating that RNA was likely to be the functional product. This was consistent with our finding that synthesis of traD RNA containing the translational defect was able to complement, in trans, a temperature-sensitive traD mutation. Thus, transcription of the traD determinant is significantly involved in downregulation of the pAD1 pheromone response.
TI  - Transcription-driven DNA replication of plasmid pAMbeta1 in Bacillus subtilis.
AB  - pAMbeta1 is a plasmid isolated from Enterococcus faecalis which replicates in Bacillus subtilis by a unidirectional theta mechanism. It has been shown previously that initiation of pAMbeta1 replication requires a plasmid-encoded protein (RepE) and a short origin and is carried out by the host DNA polymerase I. It is not known which primer is used by this polymerase for initiating replication. Here, we report that a transcription fork passing through the origin is a limiting factor for plasmid replication. Transcription that activates the origin is initiated at the repE promoter and is thus regulated by the plasmid copy-number control system. Two lines of evidence suggest that the transcription generates the primer for the DNA polymerase I. First, the transcription must start upstream from the origin and progress in the direction of replication to be effective. Second, 3' ends of RNA transcripts initiated upstream of the origin map within the origin, provided that the Rep protein and an intact origin are present. This is the first report for simultaneous requirement of a transcription fork, a replication protein and the DNA polymerase I in initiation of DNA replication.
TI  - In-vitro activity of piperacillin/tazobactam relative to other antibiotics against blood culture isolates.
AB  - Resistance of bacteria to antibiotics is an increasing problem in many countries. Accurate locally relevant information is essential for detection and control of emerging resistance and to facilitate choice of empirical antibiotic therapy in the immediate management of seriously ill patients. We have determined the minimum inhibitory concentration of piperacillin/tazobactam for 97 strains of bacteria (55 Enterobacteriaceae, 13 non-fermentative Gram-negative bacilli, 22 Staphylococcus aureus, 6 Enterococcus faecalis and 1 Bacillus cereus) isolated from blood cultures and compared its activity to that of amoxycillin, co-amoxiclav, cephalothin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, piperacillin, cefotaxime. The strains were consecutive non-fastidious isolates with the following qualifications: coagulase negative staphylococci and diphtheroids were excluded and the number of Staphylococcus aureus isolates was limited to 12 methicillin-resistant and 10 methicillin-sensitive strains. Multiple isolates of the same species from individual patients were not included. The minimum inhibition concentrations of methicillin, penicillin, teichoplanin and vancomycin were also determined for specific groups of organisms. MICs were determined by the Etest method (AB Biodisk, Solna, Sweden) on Mueller Hinton agar. The MICs of appropriate American Type Culture Collection control strains were determined. Based on the interpretative criteria of the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (USA), 87 per cent of Gram-negative bacilli were susceptible to piperacillin/tazobactam compared with amoxycillin 26 per cent, cephalothin 35 per cent, co-amoxiclav 54 per cent, piperacillin 56 per cent, cefotaxime 69 per cent, ceftazidime 84 per cent, gentamicin 85 per cent and ciprofloxacin 91 per cent. Of all isolates 75 per cent were sensitive to piperacillin/tazobactam, compared with amoxycillin 22 per cent, cephalothin 35 per cent, piperacillin 41 per cent, co-amoxiclav 52 per cent, cefotaxime 59 per cent, ceftazidime 60 per cent, gentamicin 74 per cent and ciprofloxacin 77 per cent. Two isolates (1 E. coli and 1 Klebsiella pneumoniae) with antibiograms consistent with the relatively new resistance phenomenon of extended spectrum beta-lactamase production were identified. The spectrum of activity of piperacillin-tazobactam for empirical antibiotic therapy is significantly greater than that of piperacillin alone and is similar to that of ciprofloxacin and gentamicin.
TI  - Antibodies to urinary tract pathogens in patients with spinal cord lesions.
AB  - Chronic or recurrent urinary tract infection (UTI) is a significant problem or patients with spinal cord lesions (SCL). UTIs are thought to be a major factor in the development of reduced renal function. To investigate the pathogenesis 151 patients with SCL were included in this study during a 7 year period. Results of intravenous pyelography and isotope renography were recorded as well as the bladder emptying methods. One to seven blood samples were obtained from each patient and tested for plasma creatinine, and the presence of precipitating antibodies against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Klebsiella ozaenae, Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We found significant correlation between duration of SCL and precipitating antibodies against urinary tract pathogens (PAU) (r = 0.23, P < 0.005), between plasma creatinine and PAU in patients with spina bifida (r = 0.64, P < 0.01), between PAU and the number of positive urine cultures (r = 0.17; P < 0.05) and a relation between abnormal urological findings and PAU. In addition, the PAU was significantly higher in patients with indwelling urethral catheters (P < 0.001). Thus it seems that PAU can be of prognostic value in SCL patients, and PAU might be an indicator for intensified treatment of recurrent UTI.
TI  - Conservation of the major cold shock protein in lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Primers designed from consensus regions of the major cold shock gene of different bacterial species were used in PCR amplification of Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB). An appropriately-sized PCR product was obtained from Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis LL43-1 and MG1363; Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris LC10-1, LC11-1, and LC12-1; Streptococcus thermophilus ST1-1; Enterococcus faecalis EF1-1; Lactobacillus acidophilus LA1-1; Lactobacillus helveticus LH1-1; Pediococcus pentosaceus PP1-1; and Bifidobacterium animalis BA1-1. The PCR products were cloned and sequenced. The deduced amino acid sequences displayed high sequence similarity with the major cold shock proteins of Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis and the human Y-box factor. The amino acid residues of the cold shock domain implicated in nucleic acid binding in several unrelated species were also highly conserved in the LAB strains. It is possible, therefore, that this protein in LAB may also act as a transcriptional enhancer to other cold shock genes and/or act as an RNA chaperone unwinding tightly folded RNA molecules.

TI  - The colonization of a simulator of the human intestinal microbial ecosystem by a  probiotic strain fed on a fermented oat bran product: effects on the gastrointestinal microbiota.
AB  - The effects of Lactobacillus-GG-fermented oat bran product on the microbiota and  its metabolic activity in the human gut were investigated, using a simulator of the human intestinal microbial ecosystem (SHIME), by analysing the bacterial population, shortchain fatty acids and gas production. In addition, the effects of fermented oat bran supernatant and supernatant samples from reactors 4, 5 and 6 (large intestine) on the growth of Escherichia coli IHE 13047, Enterococcus faecalis VTT E-93203, Lactobacillus rhamnosus VTT E-94522 (Lactobacillus GG) and Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis VTT E-90414 were monitored to ascertain possible stimulatory/inhibitory effects by an in vitro turbidometric method. Our experiments showed that Lactobacillus GG colonized the SHIME reactor and this colonization could be maintained for several weeks without extra supplementation. Oat bran feeding also favoured the growth of bifidobacteria and caused an increase in the production of acetic, propionic and butyric acid as well as CH4 and CO2. However, the effects of oat bran, either on bacterial populations or on their metabolic activity, were not directly dose-dependent. In turbidometric measurements, the supernatant of fermented oat bran exerted an inhibitory effect of Lactobacillus GG, but stimulated the growth of enterococci.
TI  - Blue/white screening of recombinant plasmids in Gram-positive bacteria by interruption of alkaline phosphatase gene (phoZ) expression.
AB  - The process of screening bacterial transformants for recombinant plasmids is made more rapid and simple by the use of vectors with visually detectable reporter genes. In such systems, an alteration in colony phenotype occurs when a vector-borne indicator gene is interrupted with exogenous DNA. Although the lacZ system has been used extensively for this purpose in E. coli, analogous systems for use in Gram-positive bacteria remain uncommon. We have developed a Gram-positive cloning vector that utilizes the interruption of an alkaline phosphatase gene, phoZ, to identify recombinant plasmids. To facilitate introduction of foreign DNA, a multiple cloning site (MCS) was inserted distal to the region coding for the putative signal peptide of phoZ. Alkaline phosphatase expressed from the derivative phoZ gene (phoZMCS) retained activity similar to that of the native protein. The phoZMCS was transferred to pJS3, a well-characterized, high-copy number, and broad-host-range plasmid, to produce pDC123. In pDC123, phoZMCS was transcriptionally linked to the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (cat) gene under the control of the constitutively expressed tetM and cat promoters that drive cat expression in pJS3. S. agalactiae (Group B streptococci, GBS), E. faecalis, S. pyogenes, S. gordonii, and E. coli containing pDC123 displayed a blue colonial phenotype on agar containing 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (X-p), which was readily distinguished from that of colonies containing the parent plasmid pJS3. Introduction of foreign DNA into the MCS of phoZMCS produced a white colonial phenotype in E. coli and GBS on agar containing X-p and allowed discrimination between transformants containing recombinant plasmids versus those maintaining self-annealed or uncut vector. We have used pDC123 to subclone the cpsE gene from the plasmid pCER111, which carries a 9.0-kb fragment of the GBS capsular polysaccharide synthesis locus. The plasmid pDC123 containing cpsE was isolated by direct electroporation into GBS strain A909 with selection of transformants containing recombinant plasmids achieved by 'blue/white' screening, without the use of an intermediate host. This new cloning vector should improve the efficiency of performing recombinant DNA experiments in Gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - In vivo characterization of the type A and B vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) VanRS two-component systems in Escherichia coli: a nonpathogenic model for studying the VRE signal transduction pathways.
AB  - Escherichia coli reporter strains modeling the high-level type A and B vancomycin resistances of Enterococcus faecium BM4147 and Ent. faecalis have been developed to study the respective VanR-VanS two-component regulatory systems. PvanH-, PvanRa-, PvanY-, and PvanRb-lacZ fusions report on expression from the vancomycin-resistant enterococci promoters of the type A vanRSHAXYZ and type B vanRSYWHBX gene clusters. These strains also express from single-copy chromosomal genes vanRa, vanRb, or vanRSb behind their respective promoter (PvanRa or PvanRb) or vanSa or vanSb behind the rhamnose-inducible PrhaB. Results show that activation (phosphorylation) of the response regulator VanRa by its sensor kinase VanSa leads to transcriptional activation of both PvanH and PvanRa. Additionally, VanRb activates its cognate promoters PvanY and PvanRb, although this occurs only in the absence of VanSb and presumably is caused by VanRb phosphorylation by an unidentified endogenous E. coli kinase. Thus, VanSb interferes with activation of VanRb, probably by acting as a phospho-VanRb phosphatase. Although both VanRa and VanRb activate their cognate promoters, neither activates the heterologous PvanR, PvanH, or PvanY, arguing against the interchangeability of type A and B two-component regulatory switches in vancomycin-resistant enterococci. VanRa also is activated by the nonpartner kinase PhoR. Because this occurs in the absence of its inducing signal (Pi limitation), PhoR autophosphorylation apparently is regulated in vivo. Furthermore, the activation of VanRa caused by cross talk from PhoR in the absence of a signal allows distinction of cross talk from crossregulation as the latter, but not the former, responds to environmental cues.
TI  - Growth of a human intestinal Desulfovibrio desulfuricans in continuous cultures containing defined populations of saccharolytic and amino acid fermenting bacteria.
AB  - Ecological and physiological effects of the sulphate-reducing bacterium (SRB) Desulfovibrio desulfuricans on other intestinal organisms were investigated in anaerobic chemostats (dilution rate approximately 0.2 h-1). Reproducible defined bacterial communities were used in these experiments, comprising 14 different saccharolytic and amino acid fermenting species: Bifidobacterium longum, Bif. adolescentis, Bif. pseudolongum, Bif. infantis, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bact. vulgatus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Enterococcus faecalis, Ent. faecium, Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens, Cl. butyricum, Cl. innocuum, Cl. bifermentans. Lactobacillus and Cl. bifermentans populations never rose above minimum detection limits (log10 2.0 and 4.0, respectively) under the experimental conditions employed in these studies. Inclusion of Des. desulfuricans in bacterial cultures (c. log10 8.4 viable cells ml-1) resulted in marked reductions (i.e. greater than 1 log) in planktonic cell population densities of several species, particularly Bif. longum, Cl. perfringens and Bif. pseudolongum. The two bacteroides species were unaffected by Des. desulfuricans, while numbers of Cl. butyricum increased. Extensive wall growth developed in the SRB culture, consisting mainly of Des. desulfuricans (log10 9.2 viable cells ml-1), Bact. thetaiotaomicron and Bact. vulgatus, with lesser numbers of facultative anaerobes, Cl. perfringens and Bif. longum. Wall growth was associated with a reduction in planktonic cell mass and increased acid production by the cultures. Chemotaxonomic study of chemostat microbiotas, on the basis of cellular fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) analyses, showed the existence of characteristic bacteroides (C15) and bifidobacterial (C18) markers, but desulfovibrio markers (i-C15:0, C16:0, i-C17:1) could be identified. The metabolic activities of saccharolytic organisms were altered in the SRB chemostat, including synthesis of a number of hydrolytic enzymes involved in carbohydrate breakdown, such as alpha-galactosidase, alpha-glucosidase and beta-galactosidase, together with several mucinolytic enzymes. High concentrations of sulphide (8.2 mmol 1-1) were detected in the SRB chemostat, suggesting that this metabolite may have been inhibitory to some species. Saccharolytic organisms growing in the SRB fermenter utilized more starch, but less galactose-containing polymers, which correlated with the observed glycosidase activities. Profound differences were also recorded with respect to fermentation product formation in the chemostats, where a major switch to acetate production occurred in the SRB culture, with concomitant reductions in propionate, butyrate and lactate, which is an important electron donor for desulfovibrios.
TI  - Detection and characterization of a novel antibacterial substance produced by a Lactobacillus delbrueckii strain 1043.
AB  - A novel antibacterial substance produced by a strain isolated from Bulgarian yellow cheese was characterized. The producer strain was identified by molecular typing to belong to the species Lactobacillus delbrueckii, which is a rare producer of bacteriocins. The inhibitory agent was heat stable and active against lactic acid bacteria species and several food-borne pathogens: Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Yersinia enterocolitica and Y. pseudotuberculosis. Its sensitivity to amylolitic enzymes and lipase suggested that a lipid and carbohydrate moiety could be important for the activity. The amino acid content of the purified bacteriocin was estimated to 29 amino acids. The bacteriocin was shown to be small (3.6-6 kDa) by three different methods: HPLC gel-filtration, SDS-PAGE and amino acid contents.
TI  - Decontamination of drinking water by direct heating in solar panels.
AB  - A device was developed for direct heating of water by solar radiation in a flow-through system of copper pipes. An adjustable thermostat valve prevents water below the chosen temperature from being withdrawn. The results show that it is possible to eliminate coliform and thermotolerant coliform bacteria from naturally contaminated river water by heating to temperatures of 65 degrees C or above. Artificial additions of Salmonella typhimurium, Streptococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli to contaminated river water were also inactivated after heating to 65 degrees C and above. The total viable count could be reduced by a factor of 1000. The heat-resistant bacteria isolated from the Mlalakuva River (Tanzania) were spore-forming bacteria which exhibited greater heat resistance than commonly used test bacteria originating from countries with colder climates. To provide a good safety margin it is recommended that an outlet water temperature of 75 degrees C be used. At that temperature the daily production was about 501 of decontaminated water per m2 of solar panel, an amount that could be doubled by using a heat exchanger to recycle the heat.
TI  - Resistance to antimicrobial agents used for animal therapy in pathogenic-, zoonotic- and indicator bacteria isolated from different food animals in Denmark: a baseline study for the Danish Integrated Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring Programme (DANMAP).
AB  - This study describes the establishment and first results of a continuous surveillance system of antimicrobial resistance among bacteria isolated from pigs, cattle and broilers in Denmark. The three categories of bacteria tested were: 1) indicator bacteria (Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium), 2) zoonotic bacteria (Campylobacter coli/jejuni, Salmonella enterica, Yersinia enterocolitica), and 3) animal pathogens (E. coli, Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), Staphylococcus hyicus, Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae). A total of 3304 bacterial isolates collected from October 1995 through December 1996 were tested for susceptibility to all major classes of antimicrobial agents used for therapy in Denmark. Bacterial species intrinsically resistant to an antimicrobial were not tested towards that antimicrobial. Acquired resistance to all antimicrobials was found. The occurrence of resistance varied by animal origin and bacterial species. In general, resistance was observed more frequently among isolates from pigs than from cattle and broilers. The association between the occurrence of resistance and the consumption of the antimicrobial is discussed, as is the occurrence of resistance in other countries. The results of this study show the present level of resistance to antimicrobial agents among a number of bacterial species isolated from food animals in Denmark. Thus, the baseline for comparison with future prospective studies has been established, enabling the determination of trends over time.
TI  - Enterococcus faecalis glutathione reductase: purification, characterization and expression under normal and hyperbaric O2 conditions.
AB  - Glutathione reductase is found ubiquitously in eukaryotes and Gram-negative bacteria, and plays a significant role in bacterial defense against oxidative stress. Glutathione reductase from the Gram-positive bacterium Enterococcus faecalis was purified to homogeneity using anion exchange, hydrophobic interaction, and affinity chromatography. The homogeneous 49-kDa enzyme contained 1 mol bound FAD per subunit. The determined N-terminal amino acid sequence of the E. faecalis enzyme displays significant identity with glutathione reductases from other Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, as well as yeast and human erythrocyte reductases. The kinetic mechanism is ping-pong, and the determined kinetic parameters exhibited by the E. faecalis glutathione reductase are similar to those found for glutathione reductases from yeast, Escherichia coli, and human erythrocyte. A two-fold increased expression of glutathione reductase activity and a three-fold induction of glutathione peroxidase activity were observed under hyperbaric O2 growth conditions without a corresponding change in the total glutathione and soluble thiol content. The difference in the expression of the enzyme, and its cognate substrate's intracellular concentration, under these conditions suggest that the gene encoding glutathione reductase is responsive to oxygen concentration, but that the genes encoding the glutathione synthesizing enzymes are not linked to an oxygen-sensitive promoter.
TI  - Surveillance of antimicrobial resistance in bacteria isolated from food animals to antimicrobial growth promoters and related therapeutic agents in Denmark.
AB  - This study was conducted to describe the occurrence of acquired resistance to antimicrobials used for growth promotion among bacteria isolated from swine, cattle and poultry in Denmark. Resistance to structurally related therapeutic agents was also examined. Three categories of bacteria were tested: 1) indicator bacteria (Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium), 2) zoonotic bacteria (Campylobacter, Salmonella, Yersinia enterocolitica), and 3) animal pathogens (E. coli, Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), Staphylococcus hyicus, Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae). All antimicrobials used as growth promoters in Denmark and some structurally related therapeutic agents (in brackets) were included: Avilamycin, avoparcin (vancomycin), bacitracin, carbadox, flavomycin, monensin, olaquindox, salinomycin, spiramycin (erythromycin, lincomycin), tylosin (erythromycin, lincomycin), and virginiamycin (pristinamycin). Bacterial species intrinsically resistant to an antimicrobial were not tested towards that antimicrobial. Breakpoints for growth promoters were established by population distribution of the bacteria tested. A total of 2,372 bacterial isolates collected during October 1995 to September 1996 were included in the study. Acquired resistance to all currently used growth promoting antimicrobials was found. A frequent occurrence of resistance were observed to avilamycin, avoparcin, bacitracin, flavomycin, spiramycin, tylosin and virginiamycin, whereas resistance to carbadox, monensin, olaquindox and salinomycin was less frequent. The occurrence of resistance varied by animal origin and bacterial species. The highest levels of resistance was observed among enterococci, whereas less resistance was observed among zoonotic bacteria and bacteria pathogenic to animals. The association between the occurrence of resistance and the consumption of the antimicrobial is discussed. The results show the present level of resistance to growth promoters in bacteria from food animals in Denmark. They will form the baseline for comparison with future prospective studies, thereby enabling the determination of trends over time.
TI  - The effect of pH on the inhibition of bacterial growth by physiological concentrations of butyric acid: implications for neonates fed on suckled milk.
AB  - Butyric acid is released from milk by pre-intestinal lipases during suckling. It  is also known to inhibit bacterial growth. To investigate whether butyric acid may be a significant factor in controlling bacterial growth in the stomach of pre-weaned animals, the ability of butyric acid to inhibit growth of selected bacteria was tested over physiological ranges of pH and butyric acid concentrations. Six enteric and environmental strains of bacteria were used: two strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, and Enterococcus casseliflavus. At pH 4.5 and 5.0, the growth of all organisms was significantly inhibited in the presence of butyrate, and in some cases growth was completely arrested. At pH 6.0, butyric acid did not affect bacterial growth until the concentration reached 40 mM. The maximum concentration of butyric acid available in cow's milk after incubation with pre-gastric lipase is approximately 16 mM, which would be sufficient to prevent growth of the organisms tested at pH values occurring in the stomach. Therefore, butyric acid inhibition of bacterial growth may explain in part, the role of pre-intestinal lipases in young animals' natural defenses against bacteria in ingested food prior to weaning.
TI  - A cluster of genes involved in polysaccharide biosynthesis from Enterococcus faecalis OG1RF.
AB  - Our previous work identified a cosmid clone containing a 43-kb insert from Enterococcus faecalis OG1RF that produced a nonprotein antigen in Escherichia coli. In the present work, we studied this clone in detail. Periodate treatment of lysates of the clone confirmed that the antigen was carbohydrate in nature. Analysis of DNA sequences and transposon insertion mutants suggested that the insert contained a multicistronic gene cluster. Database comparison showed that the cluster contained genes similar to genes involved in the biosynthesis of dTDP-rhamnose, glycosyltransferases, and ABC transporters involved in the export of sugar polymers from both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. Insertions in several genes within the cluster abolished the immunoreactivity of the clone. This is the first report on a gene cluster of E. faecalis involved in the biosynthesis of an antigenic polysaccharide.
TI  - Toxicity of hydrogen peroxide produced by electroplated coatings to pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - The ability of various electroplated coatings (cobalt, zinc, copper, and cobalt-containing alloys of nickel, zinc, chromium, etc.) to inhibit the growth of pathogenic bacteria (Gram-positive bacteria Enterococcus faecalis and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae) was determined by a drop-method antibacterial experiment. The amounts of H2O2 produced and metal ions dissolved from the surfaces of various electroplated coatings were measured and it was found that the inhibitory ability of coatings corresponded to the amounts of H2O2 produced. The more significant the inhibition of the coating to bacterial growth, the greater the amount of H2O2 production. In addition, the bacterial survival rates on the surfaces of coatings were almost zero when H2O2 was produced in amounts greater than 10(-6) mmol/cm2. However, the dominant concentrations of metal ions dissolved from coatings were outside of the bacterial lethal range.
TI  - Diamorphine and bupivacaine mixtures: an in vitro study of microbiological safety.
AB  - A small survey confirms that epidural infusions are often prepared by clinicians  and solutions may be changed each day because of fears of microbiological contamination. We have assessed the microbiological safety of six mixtures of diamorphine (0.01-1.0%) and bupivacaine (0.1-0.5%) representing the spectrum of clinically useful concentrations for use as extradural infusions. The solutions were studied for antibacterial activity against common contaminants of fluids: Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis and a coagulase negative Staphylococcus sp. A saline control was included. Challenge experiments used an inoculum of approximately 5.0 x 10(6) cfu/ml. Mixtures were incubated at 30 degrees C for up to 7 days. Viable counts of all organisms decreased with time for all the formulations tested. Formulations containing 0.5% bupivacaine were rapidly bactericidal, and increasing diamorphine concentrations increased this effect. Formulations with 0.5% bupivacaine had more activity than those with 0.1% bupivacaine. Mixtures of diamorphine and bupivacaine in concentrations used clinically have bactericidal activity against commonly encountered skin organisms. The common practice of changing every day epidural infusions containing these drugs is unnecessary.
TI  - Experimental root canal infections in conventional and germ-free mice.
AB  - A small animal model was evaluated to study the interrelationships between microorganisms after their implantation in root canals (inferior central incisors) using germ-free (GF) and conventional (CV) mice. The selected microorganisms were: Porphyromonas endodontalis (ATCC 35406), Eubacterium lentum (ATCC 25559), Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (ATCC 27337), Fusobacterium nucleatum (ATCC 10953), Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), and Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 4083). Only P. anaerobius, E. coli, and E. faecalis, respectively, were able to colonize when inoculated alone into the root canal of both CV and GF mice. E. lentum, when inoculated alone colonized only in CV animals. P. endodontalis and F. nucleatum were unable to colonize in CV and GF animals after single inoculation. It is concluded that the experimental animal model presented herein is valuable for ecological studies of root canal infections and that only some strict anaerobic bacteria are able to colonize mice root canals when inoculated by themselves alone in pure culture.
TI  - An immunoassay for the detection and quantitative determination of mycothiol.
AB  - Mycothiol (MSH) is a glycosylated derivative of N-acetylcysteine that may have antioxidant functions in mycobacteria and other actinomycetes. To develop a highly specific assay for MSH, we capitalized on the selective binding of thiols to a maleimide residue linked to bovine serum albumin and employed affinity-purified polyclonal antibody and an enzyme-linked secondary antibody for detection. The assay was shown to be specific and to detect MSH at levels as low as 0.1 pmol when conducted in the form of a microtiter plate-based ELISA. A similar, nitrocellulose membrane-based immunoassay was shown to be useful for qualitative detection of MSH-producing bacterial colonies.
TI  - Bacteriology of burns.
AB  - A retrospective study was undertaken at University College of Medical Sciences and Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital, Delhi, to examine the bacterial isolates from the Burns unit and to determine the antibiograms of the isolates to commonly used antimicrobial agents. A total of 600 pus samples from as many patients received, over a period of 5 years (June 1993-June 1997) yielded 920) isolates. Pseudomonas spp. was the most common (36%) followed by Staphylococcus aureus (19%), Klebsiella spp. (15.54%), Proteus spp. (11.19%), Enterococcus faecalis (8.5%), Escherichia coli (5.10%), Acinetobacter spp. (1.1%), Salmonella senftenberg (0.8%) and other (3%). Pseudomonas spp. was the most susceptible to ceftazidime (83% susceptible) and cefoperazone (82% susceptible), whereas the drugs most effective in other Gram-negative organisms were amikacin, netilmicin and ciproflox. Vancomycin was effective in 100% of Gram-positive organisms. The infection of burn wounds with multiple organisms, with the superadded problem of drug resistance, necessitate the institution of a drug policy by the hospitals for burn patients.
TI  - Susceptibility survey of piperacillin/tazobactam and some beta-lactam comparators in Italy.
AB  - From September 1994 to March 1995 an Italian multicenter in vitro study to evaluate the susceptibility of piperacillin/tazobactam compared with that of imipenem, ceftazidime, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime and ampicillin/sulbactam against aerobic bacterial pathogens isolated in 132 different hospitals, was undertaken. In total, 26,732 isolates were collected but only 25,266 aerobic bacteria were able to be evaluated (16,863 Gram-negative and 8,403 Gram-positive). Escherichia coli was the most frequent pathogen isolated (25.9%) followed by Staphylococcus aureus (14.9%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (13.9%), Enterococcus faecalis (8.2%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (5.9%). Piperacillin/tazobactam had a general spectrum of activity (84.8% susceptible strains) comparable to imipenem (87.9%), and was distinctly greater than ceftazidime (71.1%).
TI  - Bacterial adherence to self-reinforced polyglycolic acid and self-reinforced polylactic acid 96 urological spiral stents in vitro.
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the bacterial adherence to biodegradable self-reinforced polyglycolic acid (SR-PGA) and self-reinforced poly-DL-lactic acid (SR-PLA 96) spiral stents in vitro. They are used as temporary urethral stents in urology. Gold-plated metal wire, polyurethane and latex were used as controls. Materials were incubated up to 28 days in artificial urine, after which a bacterial suspension was added. After detaching by sonication the adhesive bacteria were analysed as colony forming units (CFUs) and by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis. Adhesion was more significantly correlated to stent bacterial type than to the tested material in both assays. No encrustation was seen on SR-PGA or SR-PLA 96. SR-PGA and SR-PLA 96 had no effect on the bacterial growth. In conclusion, the bacterial properties are equally or more important than the material properties in the adhesion process.
TI  - Urinary excretion and bactericidal activities of a single oral dose of 400 milligrams of fleroxacin versus a single oral dose of 800 milligrams of pefloxacin in healthy volunteers.
AB  - Twelve healthy volunteers participated in this randomized crossover study to compare the concentrations and recovery levels of fleroxacin and pefloxacin in urine and to assess their bactericidal activities against 12 strains of urinary pathogens with different susceptibilities over a wide range of MICs. The volunteers received a single oral dose of 400 mg of fleroxacin or 800 mg of pefloxacin. The mean cumulative renal excretion of unchanged fleroxacin, N-demethyl-fleroxacin, and N-oxide-fleroxacin accounted for 67, 7, and 6% of the total dose, respectively. The total urinary recovery of pefloxacin and the active metabolite norfloxacin was 34%. In the time-kill and the urinary bactericidal titer (UBT) studies, only the subjects' urine not supplemented with broth was used. With most tested organisms and both quinolones it took more than 8 h to achieve a reduction in CFU of 99.9% (3 log units). Overall, there was a good correlation between UBTs and MICs for the strains. Against Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 the median UBTs were similar for both antibiotics and at least 1:8 for 96 h; against the E. coli strain for which the MIC was 0.5 microgram/ml the UBT was at least 1:4 for 48 h. The UBTs of both drugs against Klebsiella pneumoniae were at least 1:16 for 72 h. The UBTs for Staphylococcus aureus (the MIC for which was 16 micrograms/ml) of both antibiotics were low, and in some of the samples, no bactericidal titers were observed. UBTs for Proteus mirabilis of pefloxacin are significantly higher than those of fleroxacin. For Pseudomonas aeruginosa the median UBTs were present for the 24-to-48-h interval. The same is true for Enterococcus faecalis. Against Staphylococcus saprophyticus, UBTs were present for at least 48 h with both quinolones. Overall, a single oral dose of 400 mg of fleroxacin exhibits UBTs comparable to those of 800 mg of pefloxacin. Therefore, it may be expected that half of the dose of fleroxacin gives comparable results in the treatment of urinary tract infections; this should be substantiated in comparative clinical trials.
TI  - MEN 10700, a new penem antibiotic: in-vitro activity and its correlation with beta-lactamase stability, PBP affinity and diffusion through the bacterial cell wall.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of MEN 10700, a novel penem, was compared with that of imipenem, ritipenem, ampicillin/sulbactam, cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin and amikacin against 1088 strains taken from 21 genera, including Gram-negative, Gram-positive and anaerobic bacteria. MIC data showed that MEN 10700 was very active against staphylococci and streptococci (MIC90 < or = 0.5 mg/L) and against most members of the Enterobacteriaceae (MIC90 < or = 2 mg/L), with reduced activity only against Providencia stuartii (MIC90 = 8 mg/L). MEN 10700 was also active against anaerobic species such as Clostridium perfringens and Bacteroides fragilis as well as Moraxella catarrhalis. It was moderately active against Enterococcus faecalis and inactive against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Aeromonas spp. and Acinetobacter spp. Its antibacterial spectrum was thus slightly narrower than that of imipenem, but compared favourably with those of a third-generation cephalosporin and ritipenem. MEN 10700 was highly stable to a number of beta-lactamases and was a poor inducer of class I enzymes. It bound penicillin-binding protein 2 with the highest affinity and easily permeated the outer membrane of Escherichia coli.
TI  - A comparison between single-dose fosfomycin trometamol (Monuril) and a 5-day course of trimethoprim in the treatment of uncomplicated lower urinary tract infection in women.
AB  - This study is a comparison of the microbiological and clinical efficacy of single-dose fosfomycin trometamol therapy and a 5 day course of trimethoprim in the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infection in female patients. Urine dip-slide samples were obtained from 547 female patients aged 18-65 by 22 General Practitioners (GPs) participating in the study from 21 centres in the UK. All patients were diagnosed as having a urinary tract infection by their GP on the basis of history and clinical examination. Patients were randomised to receive either single dose fosfomycin trometamol or a 5 day course of trimethoprim in a 2:1 ratio. Patients who had significant bacteriuria (> or = 10(5) c.f.u/ml) at the first visit (300) were included in the microbiological analysis. The two commonest urinary pathogens isolated were Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus saprophyticus. Trimethoprim resistance was more frequent amongst E. coli isolates whereas fosfomycin trometamol resistance was more common amongst S. saprophyticus isolates. Microbiological cure was demonstrated in 83.3% of the trimethoprim treated group and 83% of the fosfomycin trometamol treated group. Persistence of the infecting bacteria was seen in 17% of each treatment arm.
TI  - Urinary bactericidal activity and pharmacokinetics of enoxacin versus norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin in healthy volunteers after a single oral dose.
AB  - In an open, randomised monocentric crossover study in six male and six female healthy volunteers, the urinary antibacterial activity and pharmacokinetics of enoxacin, norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin were assessed. Urine was collected up to 6 days, and venous blood samples up to 12 h, after a single oral dose of 400 mg enoxacin, 400 mg norfloxacin and 500 mg ciprofloxacin. Enoxacin (250 mg/l) demonstrated the highest peak concentration (median) in the urine (0-6 h), followed by ciprofloxacin (237 mg/l) and norfloxacin (157 mg/l) as determined by the HPLC assay. The total amount (mean) excreted by the kidneys as parent drugs were as follows: enoxacin 54% of dose, ciprofloxacin 33% of dose, and norfloxacin 22% of dose. The mean plasma concentrations decreased from 1 to 4 h after administration for enoxacin from 1.9 to 1.4 mg/l, for ciprofloxacin from 2.0 to 0.8 mg/l and for norfloxacin from 1.3 to 0.5 mg/l. The antibacterial activity in urine was determined as urinary bactericidal titers (UBT), i.e. the highest 2-fold dilution of urine still bactericidal for the reference organism (E. coli ATCC 25,922) and for five uropathogens with minimal inhibitory (MIC) and bactericidal (MBC) concentrations ranging from highly susceptible to resistant cultured from the urine of patients with complicated urinary tract infections (UTI). For the E. coli ATCC 25,922, the organism with the lowest MIC, median UBTs of ciprofloxacin were present for 4 days, decreasing from 1:512 to 1:2, that of enoxacin for 2 days, decreasing from 1:256 to 1:4, and that of norfloxacin for 2 days, decreasing from 1:128 to 1:2. For the five uropathogens (with increasing MICs: K. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis, E. coli (resistant to nalidixic acid), P. aeruginosa and E. faecalis), the UBTs decreased in general, according to MICs, demonstrating the same relations of UBTs for ciprofloxacin (highest) versus enoxacin (medium) versus norfloxacin (lowest) with one exception (P. mirabilis) for which norfloxacin showed higher UBTs than enoxacin. The minimal urinary bactericidal concentrations (MUBC), as derived from urinary concentrations, and UBTs showed a fairly wide inter- and intraindividual range and were generally higher than the corresponding MBCs as determined in Mueller Hinton broth. In conclusion, according to antibacterial activity in urine determined as UBTs, a single oral dose of ciprofloxacin (500 mg) generally resulted in the highest and longest-lasting UBTs followed by that of enoxacin (400 mg) and norfloxacin (400 mg). A dose of 400 mg enoxacin can be expected to be at least equivalent if not superior to that of 400 mg norfloxacin. Only enoxacin and ciprofloxacin exhibited urinary bactericidal activity against all test organisms up to 12 h in all individuals. Therefore, clinical comparison of enoxacin versus ciprofloxacin in the treatment of complicated UTI could be worth testing.
TI  - Novel antibiotic susceptibility tests by the ATP-bioluminescence method using filamentous cell treatment.
AB  - Antimicrobial susceptibility testing by the ATP-bioluminescence method has been noted for its speed; it provides susceptibility results within 2 to 5 h. However, several disagreements between the ATP method and standard methodology have been reported. The present paper describes a novel ATP method in a 3.5-h test which overcomes these deficiencies through the elimination of false-resistance discrepancies in tests on gram-negative bacteria with beta-lactam agents. In our test model using Pseudomonas aeruginosa and piperacillin, it was shown that ATP in filamentous cells accounted for the false resistance. We found that 0.5% 2-amino-2-methyl-1,3-propanediol (AMPD) extracted ATP from the filamentous cells without affecting normal cells and that 0.3 U of adenosine phosphate deaminase (APDase)/ml simultaneously digested the extracted ATP. We used the mixture of these reagents for the pretreatment of cells in a procedure we named filamentous cell treatment, prior to ATP measurements. This novel ATP method with the filamentous cell treatment eliminated false-resistance discrepancies in tests on P. aeruginosa with beta-lactam agents, including piperacillin, cefoperazone, aztreonam, imipenem-cilastatin, ceftazidime, and cefsulodin. Furthermore, this novel methodology produced results which agreed with those of the standard microdilution method in other tests on gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, including P. aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis, for non-beta-lactam agents, such as fosfomycin, ofloxacin, minocycline, and aminoglycosides. MICs obtained by the novel ATP method were also in agreement with those obtained by the agar dilution method of susceptibility testing. From these results, it was shown that the novel ATP method could be used successfully to test the activities of antimicrobial agents with the elimination of the previously reported discrepancies.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of pediocin AcH chimeric protein mutants with altered bactericidal activity.
AB  - A collection of pediocin AcH amino acid substitution mutants was generated by PCR random mutagenesis of DNA encoding the bacteriocin. Mutants were isolated by cloning mutagenized DNA into an Escherichia coli malE plasmid that directs the secretion of maltose binding protein-pediocin AcH chimeric proteins and by screening transformant colonies for bactericidal activity against Lactobacillus plantarum NCDO955 (K. W. Miller, R. Schamber, Y. Chen, and B. Ray, 1998. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 64:14-20, 1998). In all, 17 substitution mutants were isolated at 14 of the 44 amino acids of pediocin AcH. Seven mutants (N5K, C9R, C14S, C14Y, G37E, G37R, and C44W) were completely inactive against the pediocin AcH-sensitive strains L. plantarum NCDO955, Listeria innocua Lin11, Enterococcus faecalis M1, Pediococcus acidilactici LB42, and Leuconostoc mesenteroides Ly. A C24S substitution mutant constructed by other means also was inactive against these bacteria. Nine other mutants (K1N, W18R, I26T, M31T, A34D, N41K, H42L, K43N, and K43E) retained from <1% to approximately 60% of wild-type activity when assayed against L. innocua Lin11. One mutant, K11E, displayed approximately 2. 8-fold-higher activity against this indicator. About one half of the mutations mapped to amino acids that are conserved in the pediocin-like family of bacteriocins. All four cysteines were found to be required for activity, although only C9 and C14 are conserved among pediocin-like bacteriocins. Several basic amino acids as well as nonpolar amino acids located within the hydrophobic C-terminal region also were found to be important. The mutations are discussed in the context of structural models that have been proposed for the bacteriocin.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (1996), III. Secular changes in susceptibility].
AB  - Susceptibilities to various antimicrobial agents were examined for Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., and Pseudomonas aeruginosa that were isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 10 hospitals during June 1996 to May 1997, and the results were compared with those obtained during the same period in earlier years. 1. E. faecalis Among E. faecalis strains, those with high susceptibilities to ampicillin and minocycline appeared to have decreased in the latest study period. 2. S. aureus To almost antimicrobial agents, S. aureus isolated from uncomplicated UTIs showed low susceptibilities. But the MIC50s of those agents for S. aureus from complicated UTIs have changed better state. Particularly, the MIC50s of imipenem and clindamycin were 0.125 microgram/ml or below in the latest period for the first time in our history. 3. E. coli The susceptibilities to piperacillin and quinolones of E. coli isolated from uncomplicated UTIs were better than those isolated from complicated UTIs. 4. Klebsiella spp. The susceptibilities to almost antimicrobial agents of Klebsiella spp. have been better during the latest period, compared to those during period of 1995-1996, but to ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin have appeared to have been lower. 5. P. aeruginosa The susceptibilities to quinolones of P. aeruginosa have been better during the latest period compared those during periods of 1995-1996. But, the susceptibilities to cefozopran, carbapenems and monobactams of P. aeruginosa isolated from complicated UTIs appeared to have been lower. These susceptibility changes should be utilized in determining clinical treatments.
TI  - Comparison of in vitro activity of trovafloxacin against gram-positive and gram-negative organisms with quinolones and beta-lactam antimicrobial agents.
AB  - The in vitro activity of trovafloxacin against 721 Gram-negative and 498 Gram-positive organisms was determined by the standard microdilution broth method using commercially prepared frozen microtiter plates. The activity of trovafloxacin was compared to ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, ampicillin/sulbactam (1:1), piperacillin/tazobactam, ceftriaxone, and imipenem. Trovafloxacin had equal or greater activity compared with the other agents tested against Citrobacter diversus, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Serratia marcescens, staphylococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus viridans, group G streptococci, Enterococcus faecalis, and E. faecium. The reliability of the commercially prepared plates for testing the in vitro activity of the quinolones was evaluated by comparing identical isolates also tested by broth microdilution using laboratory prepared plates. The commercially prepared plates generally correlated, within one- to twofold dilutions, with the laboratory prepared plates. There was, however, a large discrepancy obtained when testing Enterobacter agglomerans and E. cloacae, where the commercially prepared plates yielded a significantly higher MIC90 value.
TI  - Conjugal transfer of plasmid DNA from Escherichia coli to enterococci: a method to make insertion mutations.
AB  - Shuttle vector pAT18 was transferred by conjugation from Escherichia coli S17-1 to Enterococcus faecalis OG1RF and Enterococcus faecium SE34. Transfer was mediated by the transfer functions of plasmid RK2 in E. coli S17-1 and the origin of conjugal transfer (oriT) located on pAT18. The oriT sequence was then inserted into two plasmids to generate vectors pTEX5235 and pTEX5236. These two vectors cannot replicate in gram-positive bacteria and can be used to make insertion mutants in gram-positive bacteria. An internal sequence from an autolysin gene of E. faecalis OG1RF was cloned into pTEX5235 and transferred by conjugation from E. coli S17-1 to E. faecalis OG1RF. The plasmid was found to integrate into the chromosome of OG1RF by a single crossover event, resulting in a disrupted autolysin gene. A cosmid carrying the pyrimidine gene cluster from E. faecalis, with a transposon insertion in pyrC, was also transferred from E. coli S17-1 to E. faecalis OG1RF. After selection for the transposon, it was found to have recombined into the recipient chromosome by a double crossover between the cosmid and the chromosome of OG1RF. This resulted in a pyrC knockout mutant showing an auxotrophic phenotype.
TI  - Translocated intestinal bacteria cause spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in cirrhotic rats: molecular epidemiologic evidence.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Intestinal bacterial translocation is common in cirrhotic rats with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and it is thought to play a major pathogenic role. There has so far been no evidence for clonality between bacteria isolated from intestine and ascites. This study aimed to use molecular epidemiology techniques to show that spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is due to translocated intestinal bacteria. METHODS: Samples of ascitic fluid, portal blood, mesenteric lymph nodes and ileal contents from healthy (n=10) and ascitic cirrhotic rats with (n=12) or without (n=15) spontaneous bacterial peritonitis were cultured. In six infected rats, DNA macrorestriction fragments of 30 bacterial isolates [Escherichia coli (n=13), Enterococcus faecalis (n=12) and Proteus mirabilis (n=5)] from ascites (n=8), mesenteric lymph nodes (n=7), portal blood (n=6), and ileal flora (n=9) were compared. RESULTS: Bacterial translocation was more frequent in animals with (58%) than in those without spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (20%, p=0.049) or controls (10%, p=0.026). The same bacterial strain was simultaneously isolated in ascites and in mesenteric lymph nodes and/or ileum in 7/8 (87%) instances. The identity rate for bacteria present in both ascites and mesenteric lymph nodes was 80% (4/5). Likewise, identity was demonstrated in 3/4 instances of bacteria found in both ascites and portal blood. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in cirrhotic rats is mainly due to intestinal bacteria translocated to mesenteric lymph nodes. Portal blood could be a less frequent route.
TI  - Carbamate kinase from Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium--cloning of  the genes, studies on the enzyme expressed in Escherichia coli, and sequence similarity with N-acetyl-L-glutamate kinase.
AB  - Carbamate kinase (CK) catalyzes the reversible reaction NH2COO- + ATP <--> NHCOOPO3(2-) + ADP, serving to synthesize ATP from carbamoyl phosphate in those microorganisms that derive energy from anaerobic arginine degradation via the arginine dihydrolase pathway. We report here the cloning and sequencing of the CK gene from Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium and we demonstrate that the amino acid sequence of CK is identical in the two species. The enzyme, expressed and isolated from Escherichia coli using simple purification procedures, was used to generate crystals suitable for X-ray studies and to investigate the utilization by CK of bicarbonate and other carbamate analogs. CK had a bicarbonate-dependent ATPase activity and, therefore, is able to synthesize carboxyphosphate, an unstable compound that is an intermediate in the reactions catalyzed by carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase (CPS) and by biotin carboxylase. Other functional similarities with CPS include the utilization of acetate by CK with a similarly high Km and the similar Km values of CK for carbamate and of CPS for bicarbonate. Enterococcal CK was inhibited by adenosine(5')pentaphospho(5')adenosine (Ap5A) and Ap6A and, less powerfully, by Ap4A, whereas Ap3A is essentially non-inhibitory. Thus, inhibition by Ap5A seems not to be a valid criterion to differentiate between CK and CPS, for the two enzymes can be inhibited by Ap5A. All these results support the relatedness of CK and CPS. Finally, we used limited proteolysis: (a) to localize the epitopes for monoclonal antibodies obtained against CK; (b) to demonstrate the importance of the C-terminus for enzyme activity; and (c) to show that Arg158 is highly exposed and may be essential for activity. Comparison of the sequence of CK with known protein sequences demonstrates considerable similarity of CK with bacterial N-acetylglutamate kinases, strongly suggesting that these two enzymes may share a similar structure and the same catalytic mechanism.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (1996). II. Background of patients].
AB  - Clinical background was investigated on patients with urinary tract infections (UTIs) from whom 752 bacterial strains were isolated in 10 hospitals during the period from June, 1996 through May, 1997. 1. Distribution of age and sex of patients and type of infections. Among males, those with ages 40 years or older were more frequent, the higher the ages of them. Among females, those with ages in the 60's were the most frequent (24.6%), and those with ages in the 20's, 40's and 50's were about 13%. With regard to type of infections, more than a half of infections among males with ages 30 years or older were of complicated types, but most of infections among females were of uncomplicated types, especially among females of ages less than 60 years. 2. Ages of patients and types of pathogens. The higher the ages of patients, the lesser became the isolation frequencies of Escherichia coli, but the higher were those of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella spp. 3. Effect of antibiotic use on isolation frequencies of pathogens. Use of antibiotics decreased pathogens isolated from patients with uncomplicated UTIs drastically (231 isolates before antibiotics compared to 60 after). Even isolated pathogens from patients with complicated UTIs decreased drastically with the use of antibiotics when indwelling catheters were not in use (193 isolates before antibiotics compared to 75 after), but when indwelling catheters were in use, antibiotics apparently failed to decrease the isolation frequency. 4. Surgical procedures and types of causative organisms for UTIs. From cases of uncomplicated UTIs, E. coli was the most frequently isolated, followed by Enterococcus Faecalis and Klebsiella spp. E. coli was the most frequently isolated organism from complicated UTIs without indwelling catheters. When a surgical procedures were not done, E. coli was isolated most frequently. From cases of complicated UTIs with indwelling catheters, P. aeruginosa, E. coli and E. faecalis were the organisms that were mainly isolated, with isolation frequencies of 23.2%, 15.2, 12.2, respectively. When no surgical procedures were used, isolation frequencies of P. aeruginosa, E. faecalis and Enterobacter spp. were 17.2%, 13.8%, 13.8%, respectively.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (1996). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The frequencies of isolation and susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents were investigated on 680 bacterial strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 10 hospitals during the period of June 1996 to May 1997. Of the above bacterial isolates, Gram-positive bacteria accounted for 30.4% and a majority of them were Enterococcus faecalis. Gram-negative bacteria accounted for 69.6% and most of them were Escherichia coli. Susceptabilities of several isolated bacteria to antimicrobial agents were as followed; 1. Enterococcus faecalis Ampicillin (ABPC) showed the highest activity against E. faecalis isolated from patients with UTIs. Its MIC90 was 1 microgram/ml. Imipenem (IPM) and vancomycin (VCM) were also active with the MIC90S of 2 micrograms/ml. The others had low activities with the MIC90S of 16 micrograms/ml or above. 2. Staphylococcus aureus including MRSA Arbekacin (ABK) and VCM showed the highest activities against both S. aureus and MRSA isolated from patients with UTIs. The MIC90S of them were 1 or 2 micrograms/ml. The others except minocycline (MINO) had low activities with the MIC90S of 32 micrograms/ml or above. 3. Staphylococcus epidermidis ABK and VCM showed the strongest activities against S. epidermis isolated from patients with UTIs. The MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 2 micrograms/ml. Cefazolin (CEZ), cefotiam (CTM) and cefozopran (CZOP) were also active with the MIC90S of 4 micrograms/ml. Compared with antimicrobial activities of cephems is 1995, the MIC90S of them had changed into a better state. They ranged from 4 micrograms/ml 16 micrograms/ml in 1996. 4. Streptococcus agalactiae All drugs except MINO were active against S. agalactiae. ABPC, CZOP, IPM, and clarithromycin (CAM) showed the highest activities. The MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 0.125 micromilligrams. Tosufloxacin (TFLX) and VCM were also active with the MIC90S of 0.5 micromilligrams. 5. Citrobacter freundii Gentamicin (GM) showed the highest activity against C. freundii isolated from patients with UTIs. Its MIC90 was 0.5 micrograms/ml. IPM and amikacin (AMK) were also active with the MIC90S of 1 microgram/ml and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. Cefpirome (CPR) and CZOP were also active with the MIC90S of 8 micrograms/ml. The MIC90S of the others were 16 micrograms/ml or above. 6. Enterobacter cloacae IPM showed the highest activity against E. cloacae. The MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 0.5 microgram/ml. The MIC90S of ciprofloxacin (CPFX) and TFLX were 1 microgram/ml, the MIC90 of AMK was 2 micrograms/ml, the MIC90S of CZOP, GM and ofloxacin (OFLX) were 4 micrograms/ml. The MIC50S of cephems except CEZ, cefmetazole (CMZ) and cefaclor (CCL) had changed into a better state in 1996, compared with those in 1995. 7. Escherichia coli All drugs except penicillins and MINO were active against E. coli. Particularly CPR, CZOP and IPM showed the highest activities against E. coli. The MIC90S of them were 0.125 microgram/ml or below. Among E. coli strains, those with low susceptibilities to cephems except CEZ, cefoperazone (CPZ), latamoxef (LMOX) and CCL have increased in 1996, compared with those in 1995. 8. Klebsiella pneumoniae K. pneumoniae was susceptible to all drugs except penicillins, with the MIC90S of 2 micrograms/ml or below. CPR had the strongest activity, the MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 0.25 microgram/ml. Flomoxef (FMOX), cefixime (CFIX), CZOP and carumonam (CRMN) were also active with the MIC90S of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. 9. Pseudomonas aeruginosa All drugs except quinolones were not so active against P. aeruginosa with the MIC90S were 32 micrograms/ml or above. Quinolones were more active in 1996 than 1995. The MIC90S of them were between 4 micrograms/ml and 8 micrograms/ml, and the MIC50S of them were between 1 microgram/ml and 2 micrograms/ml. 10. Serratia marcescens GM showed the highest activity against S. marcescens. Its MIC90 was 1 micro
TI  - [Survey of the sensitivities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents (annual report)].
AB  - Research groups were formed in 21 institutions nationwide to investigate carbapenem resistance. The activities of various antibacterial agents, principally carbapenems were tested against clinical isolates collected from these institutions. The broth microdilution method was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of 17 antibacterial agents for 1,282 strains of 11 bacterial species isolated at all institutions between October and December 1995. The results were as follows: 1. Carbapenems exhibited strong antibacterial activities against MSSA and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Their activities against Enterococcus faecalis were comparable to that of ABPC. Carbapenems showed low activities against MRSA. 2. OFLX exhibited the greatest antibacterial activity against Haemophilus influenzae, followed by MEPM. The antibacterial activities of the other carbapenems were comparable to those of FMOX and CTM. 3. The carbapenems showed high activities against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, and Bacteroides fragilis group. Their activities were greater than that exhibited by other beta-lactam antibacterial agents. The carbapenems also exhibited greater antibacterial activities against Serratia marcescens than the other beta-lactam antibacterial agents, but some resistant strains were detected. 4. The antibacterial activities of carbapenems against Pseudomonas aeruginosa were comparable to those of CAZ, AZT, AMK.
TI  - A mixed culture recovery method indicates that enteric bacteria do not enter the  viable but nonculturable state.
AB  - A new method, called the mixed culture recovery (MCR) method, has been developed  to determine whether recovery of culturable bacterial cells from a population of largely nonculturable cells is due to resuscitation of the nonculturable cells from a viable but nonculturable state or simply to growth of residual culturable cells. The MCR method addresses this issue in that it involves the mixing of two easily distinguishable strains (e.g., lactose positive and negative) in such a way that large numbers of nonculturable cells of both strains are present together with a small number of culturable cells of only one strain, performing a nutrient addition resuscitation procedure, and then plating the cells to determine whether both cell types are recoverable. In repeated experiments with strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Salmonella choleraesuis, only cells of the culturable strain were recovered after application of various resuscitation techniques. These results suggest that the nonculturable cells were dead and that the apparent resuscitation was merely due to the growth of the remaining culturable cells.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of rhodium, iridium, and ruthenium tripodal phosphine complexes.
AB  - Twenty-eight rhodium, iridium, or ruthenium complexes were evaluated for their in vitro antibacterial activity against Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and Pseudomonaa aeruginosa ATCC 27853. Ten compounds showed an antibacterial activity against Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213 with a range of the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) between 16 and 125 micrograms/ml. None of the compounds exhibited antimicrobial activity against the gram-negative strains E. coli ATCC 25922 or Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 29213 with a concentration range between 4 and 500 micrograms/ml.
TI  - Staphylococcus aureus coenzyme A disulfide reductase, a new subfamily of pyridine nucleotide-disulfide oxidoreductase. Sequence, expression, and analysis of cdr.
AB  - The cdr gene encoding coenzyme A disulfide reductase (CoADR) from Staphylococcus  aureus 8325-4 was cloned, sequenced, and overexpressed. The gene encodes a 438-amino acid polypeptide that has a calculated molecular weight of 49,200 and sequence similarity to the pyridine nucleotide-disulfide oxidoreductase family of flavoenzymes. The deduced primary structure contains consensus sequences for flavin adenine dinucleotide and NADPH-binding regions but lacks the catalytic disulfide signature sequence typical of the glutathione reductase family of disulfide reductases. The active site region of CoADR has only a single cysteine residue that is similar to that in the conserved SFXXC active site motif of NADH oxidase and NADH peroxidase from Enterococcus faecalis. CoADR is the first disulfide reductase reported having this active site region, and sequence comparisons of CoADR to representative members of the pyridine nucleotide-disulfide reductase superfamily placed CoADR in a distinct subfamily. CoADR was overexpressed in Escherichia coli using the pET expression system, and 5-10 mg of fully active recombinant enzyme were recovered per liter of E. coli cells.
TI  - In-vitro and in-vivo antibacterial activity of CFC-222, a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  - CFC-222 is a novel fluoroquinolone with potent and broad-spectrum antibacterial activity. The in-vitro and in-vivo activities of CFC-222 were compared with those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, lomefloxacin and sparfloxacin. Against gram-positive bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus (quinolone-susceptible and quinolone-resistant), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Enterococcus faecalis, CFC-222 was more active than ciprofloxacin and similar to sparfloxacin. Against gram-negative bacteria, including Enterobacteriaceae, the in-vitro activity of CFC-222 was similar to that of sparfloxacin, but less than that of ciprofloxacin. However, it was less active than ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In mouse systemic infection caused by S. aureus Smith or S. aureus TMS 33, CFC-222 demonstrated an activity similar to that of ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin, but better than that of ofloxacin. The compound was more effective than ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin in murine infection caused by Streptococcus pyogenes ATCC 8668. Against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae infections, the efficacy of CFC-222 was similar to those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and sparfloxacin. The activity of CFC-222 was similar to those of ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against P. aeruginosa MB4-16 in the same infection model. These results suggest that CFC-222 may be a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of various bacterial infections.
TI  - Immunoreactivity of five monoclonal antibodies against the 37-kilodalton common cell wall protein (PsaA) of Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - Five monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) were produced against the Streptococcus pneumoniae pneumococcal surface adhesin A (PsaA) 37-kDa common cell wall protein. These antibodies were used in a dot immunoblot and Western blot study of clinical isolates of S. pneumoniae to detect the presence of the protein. By both assays, the MAbs reacted with clinical isolates representing the 23 type-specific serotypes present in the licensed pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine. Western blot analysis confirmed the presence of a protein migrating in the gel with a molecular mass of 37 kDa. An extension of the study by using dot immunoblot analysis that included an analysis of the 90 serotypes of S. pneumoniae showed that all five MAbs reacted with 89 of the 90 serotypes tested. MAb 1B6, the exception, did not react with S. pneumoniae serotype 16F. Dot immunoblot analysis of the MAbs with Enterococcus faecalis and viridans streptococci showed varied reactivity patterns, depending on the species. The MAbs against the 37-kDa antigen did not react with Escherichia coli, respiratory pathogens, or nonpathogens representing 22 genera and 29 species of bacteria. All five MAbs also reacted with five multidrug-resistant strains of S. pneumoniae. In summary, these MAbs may be useful for detection of pneumococcal antigen and may lead to the development of diagnostic assays for pneumococcal disease.
TI  - Discovery of novel pyridinopolyamines with potent antimicrobial activity: deconvolution of mixtures synthesized by solution-phase combinatorial chemistry.
AB  - A 1638-member pyridinopolyamine library, consisting of 13 sublibraries of 126 members prepared by a solution-phase approach, was completely deconvoluted from orthogonally protected intermediates by a combination of iterative and positional scanning procedures. Antibacterial assays against Streptococcus pyogenes and Escherichia coli imp- and a Candida albicans yeast specificity assay were employed to follow the activity of sublibraries. Screening of the 13 sublibraries, which were prepared by a synthetic method that places the differentiating functionality in a selected position A (secondary amine), at the end of the synthesis (fix last), provided several first-round activities. Subsequently, six single pyridinopolyamines (2-7) were prepared where the first-round winner, a hydrogen atom, is in the first deconvoluted position and the remaining three positions contained the same functionalities. The range of antibacterial and yeast activities of these single compounds suggested that a more active and selective compound may be discovered by completely deconvoluting the first-round active sublibraries. Pyridinopolyamine positions B (secondary benzylamine) and C (primary benzylamine) were then sequentially positionally scanned with a set of six meta-substituted benzyl functionalities to generate two sets of second/third-round sublibraries, containing 21 or 36 compounds in each sublibrary, respectively. High-throughput screening yielded sublibraries 15, 18, and 21 with MICs of 1-5 microM against S. pyogenes and E. coli imp-. Using rounds 1 and 2/3 screening data, two sets of single compounds (22-27) and (28-32) with the combination of m-(trifluoromethyl)-benzyl group at position C and m-(trifluoromethyl)benzyl or m-methylbenzyl group at position B with position D (primary benzylamine) fixed were synthesized in the fourth round deconvolution. Subsequently, broader screening of deconvoluted compounds against a tier II panel of wild-type bacteria identified eight compounds (5, 7, 27, and 29-32) with approximately 100-fold greater selectivity for Gram-positive than Gram-negative bacteria. Thus, S. pyogenes, S. pyogenes (wild-type), Streptomyces aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis were inhibited at MICs of 1-12 microM, whereas MICs for E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were > 100 microM. These eight compounds were not active (> 100 microM) against fungus C. albicans.
TI  - A broad-host-range mobilizable shuttle vector for the construction of transcriptional fusions to beta-galactosidase in gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - A low-copy-number vector designated pTCV-lac has been constructed to provide a convenient system to analyze regulatory elements in Gram-positive bacteria. The main components of this vector are: (i) the origins of replication of pACYC184 and of the broad-host-range enterococcal plasmid pAM beta 1, (ii) erythromycin- and kanamycin-resistance-encoding genes for selection in Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, (iii) the transfer origin of the IncP plasmid RK2, and (iv) a promoterless beta-galactosidase-encoding lacZ gene with a Gram-positive ribosome binding site. This 12 kb plasmid is present in Gram-positive hosts in three to five copies per chromosome equivalent and contains three unique cloning sites (EcoRI, SmaI, BamHI) for cloning of DNA inserts upstream of the lacZ gene. Plasmid pTCV-lac and derivatives carrying different promoter fragments have been transferred by conjugation from an Escherichia coli IncP mobilizing donor strain to Bacillus subtilis, Listeria monocytogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus agalactiae. These plasmids were structurally stable in these hosts and the corresponding promoter activities, quantitated by the determination of the beta-galactosidase specific activities, were found to cover at least a 100-fold range in beta-galactosidase values. These results indicate that pTCV-lac should be useful for analysis of gene regulation in a wide range of Gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - [Bacterial strains isolated from neutropenic patients and their resistance to antibiotics].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although Gram negative as well as Gram positive bacteria participate  in febrile episodes of neutropenic patients, in particular recently the ratio of Gram positive bacteria is increasing. The objective of the present work was to investigate the incidence and antibiotic resistance of pathogenic bacterial agents in neutropenic patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: The presence of bacteria was investigated in 446 neutropenic patients hospitalized at the Haematological Clinic in 1995. Haemocultures (apparatus Bact/Alert 120, cultivation media Organon-Teknika) and urine were examined. The sensitivity for antibiotics was tested by the standard dilution micromethod. In blood most frequently Staphylococcus epidermidis was isolated (45.4%), coagulase-negative strains of Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Staphylococcus hominis and Staphylococcus saprophyticus (14.4%), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-baumannii (complex 6.3%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6.3%). In urine the following were detected: Staphylococcus epidermidis (36.5%), Enterococcus sp. (14.5%), Escherichia coli (13.1%), Enterococcus faecalis (11.6%) and Enterococcus solitarius (6.5%). In all strains resistance to antibiotics and chemotherapeutic drugs was assessed. CONCLUSIONS: Investigation of the frequency of different bacterial species, along with monitoring of the resistance is an essential prerequisite of initial antibiotic therapy of febrile episodes in neutropenic patients.
TI  - Role of chemotherapeutic antagonism in opportunistic infections.
AB  - The most widely-known anti-tumor drugs often induce marked immunosuppression which can give rise to one or more sepses. Anti-infection measures immediately applied can sometimes prove largely ineffective or even useless, the patient dying not as a result of the spread of the tumour but as a direct consequence of opportunistic infection. We postulate that antagonism between anti-tumour and antimicrobial drugs may also play an important part in this. By way of illustration of this hypothesis, we have studied the action of a number of known inhibitors of peptidoglycan synthesis and of DNA-gyrases on certain strains of Gram-positive and Gram-negative microorganisms cultured in medium containing various concentrations of some of the best-known anti-tumour antimetabolites. The experimental data show that antimicrobial and anti-tumour drugs can sometimes induce synergic or indifferent chemotherapeutic interactions with many bacteria, while in others the effect is antagonistic. In practice, the action of the drugs could lead to bacterial selectivity, which, in conjunction with immunosuppression and the presence of resistant strains, could favour the evolution of opportunistic infection.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of an antibiotic produced by the scab disease-suppressive Streptomyces diastatochromogenes strain PonSSII.
AB  - An antibiotic produced by the scab disease-suppressive Streptomyces diastatochromogenes strain PonSSII has been isolated and partially characterized. The antibiotic is produced throughout culture growth, with maximum amounts accumulating in the broth when the culture is in the early stationary phase of growth. The activity declines within about 30 h after the culture enters stationary phase. Purification techniques included chromatography on Amberlite XAD-2, DEAE Sephadex and SP Sephadex in addition to C18 HPLC with an average yield of 75%. This antibiotic only inhibits pathogenic strains of S. scabies that cause scab disease on potato and other tuberous vegetables and does not affect S. griseus, S. venezuelae, Actinomyces bovis, Nocardia asteroides, Clostridium perfringens, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Micrococcus luteus, Serratia marcescens and Escherichia coli. The antibiotic has a molecular weight of 500 or less, and is stable for weeks at acidic pH but is very labile at alkaline pH conditions.
TI  - In-vitro photobactericidal activity of aminoacridines.
AB  - The toxicities of several aminoacridines were measured against pathogenic strains of both Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus cereus) and Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) organisms. In several cases, illumination at a light dose of 6.3 J/cm2 resulted in considerable decreases in the minimum lethal drug concentrations required, giving up to 50-fold increases in bactericidal activity. Derivatives of 9-aminoacridine (aminacrine) exhibited phototoxicity against one or more of the test organisms, but the established photosensitizing acridines proflavine and acridine orange were photobactericidal against all strains.
TI  - Cloning and genetic and sequence analyses of the bacteriocin 21 determinant encoded on the Enterococcus faecalis pheromone-responsive conjugative plasmid pPD1.
AB  - The pheromone-responsive conjugative plasmid pPD1 (59 kb) of Enterococcus faecalis encodes the bacteriocin 21 (bac21) determinant. Cloning, transposon insertion mutagenesis and sequence analysis of the bac21 determinant showed that an 8.5-kb fragment lying between kb 27.1 and 35.6 of the pPD1 map is required for complete expression of the bacteriocin. The 8.5-kb fragment contained nine open reading frames (ORFs), bacA to bac1, which were oriented in the same (upstream-to-downstream) direction. Transposon insertions into the bacA to bacE ORFs, which are located in the proximal half of bac21, resulted in defective bacteriocin expression. Insertions into the bacF to bac1 ORFs, which are located in the distal half of bac21, resulted in reduced bacteriocin expression. Deletion mutant analysis of the cloned 8.5-kb fragment revealed that the deletion of segments between kb 31.6 and 35.6 of the pPD1 map, which contained the distal region of the determinant encoding bacF to bac1, resulted in reduced bacteriocin expression. The smallest fragment (4.5 kb) retaining some degree of bacteriocin expression contained the bacA to bacE sequences located in the proximal half of the determinant. The cloned fragment encoding the 4.5-kb proximal region and a Tn916 insertion mutant into pPD1 bacB trans-complemented intracellularly to give complete expression of the bacteriocin. bacA encoded a 105-residue sequence with a molecular mass of 11.1 kDa. The deduced BacA protein showed 100% homology to the broad-spectrum antibiotic peptide AS-48, which is encoded on the E. faecalis conjugative plasmid pMB2 (58 kb). bacH encoded a 195-residue sequence with a molecular mass of 21.9 kDa. The deduced amino acid sequence showed significant homology to the C-terminal region of HlyB (31.1% identical residues), a protein located in the Escherichia coli alpha-hemolysin operon that is a representative bacterial ATP-binding cassette export protein.
TI  - Cloning and genetic analysis of the UV resistance determinant (uvr) encoded on the Enterococcus faecalis pheromone-responsive conjugative plasmid pAD1.
AB  - The conjugative pheromone-responsive plasmid pAD1 (59.6 kb) of Enterococcus faecalis encodes a UV resistance determinant (uvr) in addition to the hemolysin-bacteriocin determinant. pAD1 enhances the UV resistance of wild-type E. faecalis FA2-2 and E. faecalis UV202, which is a UV-sensitive derivative of E. faecalis JH2-2. A 2.972-kb fragment cloned from between 27.7 and 30.6 kb of the pAD1 map conferred UV resistance function on UV202. Sequence analysis showed that the cloned fragment contained three open reading frames designated uvrA, uvrB, and uvrC. The uvrA gene is located on the pAD1 map between 28.1 and 29.4 kb. uvrB is located between 30.1 and 30.3 kb, and uvrC is located between 30.4 and 30.6 kb on the pAD1 map. The uvrA, uvrB, and uvrC genes encode sequences of 442, 60, and 74 amino acids, respectively. The deduced amino acid sequence of the uvrA-encoded protein showed 20% homology of the identical residues with the E. coli UmuC protein. Tn917 insertion mutagenesis and deletion mutant analysis of the cloned fragment showed that uvrA conferred UV resistance. A palindromic sequence, 5'-GAACNGTTC-3', which is identical to the consensus sequence found within the putative promoter region of the Bacillus subtilis DNA damage-inducible genes, was located within the promoter region of uvrA. Two uvrA transcripts of different lengths (i.e., 1.54 and 2.14 kb) which terminate at different points downstream of uvrA were detected in UV202 carrying the deletion mutant containing uvrA. The longer transcript, 2.14 kb, was not detected in UV202 carrying the deletion mutant containing both uvrA and uvrB, which suggests that uvrB encodes a terminator for the uvrA transcript. The uvrA transcript was not detected in any significant quantity in UV202 carrying the cloned fragment containing uvrA, uvrB, and uvrC; on the other hand, the 1.54-kb uvrA transcript was detected in the strain exposed to mitomycin C, which suggests that the UvrC protein functions as a regulator of uvrA.
TI  - Cloning and sequencing of two genes, prtA and prtB, from Myxococcus xanthus, encoding PrtA and PrtB proteases, both of which are required for the protease activity.
AB  - The sequence of a 1955-bp TaqI DNA fragment from Myxococcus xanthus was determined. This fragment contains two complete genes, designated prtA and prtB. The prtA and prtB ORFs extend over 828 and 798 bp, respectively. They are separated only by 3 nt and appear to be present in a polycistronic transcriptional unit. A typical lipoprotein signal sequence is present at the N terminus of the two deduced polypeptides. The aa sequence of PrtA shows a high degree of identity to the region adjacent to the Ser residue belonging to the catalytic triad of serine proteases from Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis. It also exhibits features characteristic of trypsin-like serine proteases in that it contains the same pattern of variable and conserved regions. The deduced aa sequence of PrtB reveals a signature zinc-binding consensus motif (HEXXHXXGXXH/Met-turn) characteristic of the class of metalloproteases called metzincins. Plasmids containing prtA, prtB, or both were constructed. Protease activity studies of Escherichia coli clones containing these plasmids showed that both genes are necessary for this activity, whatever their cis or trans position. As prtB produces a putative membrane-bound lipoprotein of 266 aa, the protease activation must occur at the membrane level.
TI  - Novel fluoroquinolone antibacterial agents containing oxime-substituted (aminomethyl)pyrrolidines: synthesis and antibacterial activity of 7-(4-(aminomethyl)-3-(methoxyimino)pyrrolidin-1-yl)-1-cyclopropyl-6- fluoro-4-oxo-1,4-dihydro[1,8]naphthyridine-3-carboxylic acid (LB20304).
AB  - New pyrrolidine derivatives, which bear an alkyloxime substituent in the 4-position and an aminomethyl substituent in the 3-position of the pyrrolidine ring, have been synthesized and coupled with various quinolinecarboxylic acids to produce a series of new fluoroquinolone antibacterials. These fluoroquinolones were found to possess potent antimicrobial activity against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive organisms, including methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Variations at the C-8 position of the quinolone nucleus included fluorine, chlorine, nitrogen, methoxy, and hydrogen atom substitution. The activity imparted to the substituted quinolone nucleus by the C-8 substituent was in the order F (C5-NH2) > F (C5-H) > naphthyridine > Cl = OMe = H against Gram-positive organisms. In the case of Gram-negative strains, activity was in the order F (C5-NH2) > naphthyridine = F (C5-H) > H > Cl > OMe. The advantages provided by the newly introduced oxime group of the quinolones were clearly demonstrated by their comparison to a desoximino compound 30. In addition, the oxime moiety greatly improved the pharmacokinetic parameters of the novel quinolones. Among these compounds, compound 20 (LB20304) showed the best in vivo efficacy and pharmacokinetic profile in animals, as well as good physical properties. The MICs (microgram/mL) of LB20304, compound 30, and ciprofloxacin against several test organisms are as follows: S. aureus 6538p (0.008, 0.031, and 0.13), methicillin resistant S. aureus 241 (4, 16, and 128), Streptococcus epidermidis 887E (0.008, 0.016, and 0.13), methicillin resistant S. epidermidis 178 (4, 32, and 128), Enterococcus faecalis 29212 (0.063, 0.13, and 1), Pseudomonas aeruginosa 1912E (0.25, 0.5, and 0.13), Escherichia coli 3190Y (0.008, 0.016, and 0.008), Enterobacter cloacae P99 (0.008, 0.031, and 0.008), Actinobacter calcoaceticus 15473 (0.063, 0.13, and 0.25). On the basis of these promising results, LB20304 was selected as a candidate for further evaluation.

TI  - In vitro efficacy of antimicrobial-coated bladder catheters in inhibiting bacterial migration along catheter surface.
AB  - Most cases of catheter-related urinary tract infection are probably caused by organisms that migrate from the urethral meatus-catheter interface along the external surface of the catheter into the bladder. To examine the ability of bladder catheters coated with minocycline and rifampin to inhibit bacterial migration along the external surface of the catheter, a novel in vitro bladder model was used. Compared with uncoated catheters, antimicrobial-coated bladder catheters significantly impeded the migration of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, and Candida albicans (bacteriuria developed at a mean of 2-5 days vs. 9-34 days, respectively, after bacterial contamination of the catheter). Although production of zones of inhibition by coated catheters may provide some protection against infection, there was no correlation between the size of zones of inhibition and level of efficacy in inhibiting bacterial migration in vitro. Examination of the clinical efficacy of these antimicrobial-coated bladder catheters is prudent.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial efficacies of CFC-222, a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  - CFC-222 is a novel fluoroquinolone containing a C-7 bicyclic amine moiety with potent antibacterial activities against gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic organisms. We compared the in vitro and in vivo activities of CFC-222 with those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and lomefloxacin. CFC-222 was more active than the other fluoroquinolones tested against gram-positive bacteria. CFC-222 was particularly active against Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC at which 90% of isolates are inhibited [MIC90], 0.2 microg/ml), Staphylococcus aureus (MIC90, 0.2 microg/ml for ciprofloxacin-susceptible strains), and Enterococcus faecalis (MIC90, 0.39 microg/ml). Against Escherichia coli and other members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, CFC-222 was slightly less active than ciprofloxacin (MIC90s for E. coli, 0.1 and 0.025 microg/ml, respectively). The in vitro activity of CFC-222 was not influenced by inoculum size, medium composition, or the presence of horse serum. However, its activity was decreased significantly by a change in the pH of the medium from 7.0 to 6.0, as was the case for the other quinolones tested. The in vivo protective efficacy of CFC-222 by oral administration was greater than those of the other quinolones tested in a mouse model of intraperitoneally inoculated systemic infection caused by S. aureus. CFC-222 exhibited efficacy comparable to that of ciprofloxacin in the same model of infection caused by gram-negative organisms, such as E. coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. In this infection model, CFC-222 was slightly less active than ciprofloxacin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These results suggest that CFC-222 may be a promising therapeutic agent in various bacterial infections.
TI  - A study of photobactericidal activity in the phenothiazinium series.
AB  - The photodynamic antibacterial properties of a closely related series of commercially available phenothiazinium dyes were tested against a range of pathogenic strains of Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus cereus) and Gram-negative organisms (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa). The photosensitisers were illuminated using a non-laser light source at a fluence of 1.75 mW cm-2 and this resulted in the enhancement of antibacterial activity in liquid culture. In several cases, illumination resulted in considerable decreases in the minimum lethal concentrations required, giving up to 100-fold increases in bactericidal activity.
TI  - Excision of a conjugative transposon in vitro by the Int and Xis proteins of Tn916.
AB  - The roles of purified Int and Xis proteins of the conjugative transposon Tn 916 in excision of a deletion derivative of the closely related element Tn 1545 were investigated. At a low salt concentration (37.5 mM NaCl), Int alone was able to promote limited excision to produce a covalently closed circular form of the transposon, showing that Tn 916 Int can catalyze both DNA cleavage and strand exchange. This reaction was stimulated by Xis. At higher salt concentrations (150 mM NaCl), excision by Int alone was reduced to barely detectable levels and Xis was required for excision. The low salt, Xis-stimulated reaction was approximately 8-fold more efficient than the high salt, Xis-dependent reaction. These results reflect in vivo requirements for Int and Xis in excision.
TI  - Enterococcus faecalis antigens in human infections.
AB  - Genomic libraries of two Enterococcus faecalis strains, OG1RF and TX52 (an isolate from an endocarditis patient), were constructed in cosmid vectors pBeloBAC11 and pLAFRx, and screened with a serum from a rabbit immunized with surface proteins of an E. faecalis endocarditis isolate and sera from four patients with enterococcal endocarditis. Seventy-five cosmid clones reacted with at least two of the sera. Thirty-eight of the 75 immunopositive clones were considered to contain distinct inserts based on their DNA restriction patterns and were chosen for further subcloning into a pBluescript vector. Each sublibrary was screened with one of the five sera, and the DNA sequence of the immunopositive subclones was determined. Analysis of these sequences revealed similarities to a range of proteins, including bacterial virulence factors, transporters, two-component regulators, metabolic enzymes, and membrane or cell surface proteins. Fourteen subclones did not show significant similarity to any sequence in the databases and may contain novel genes. Thirteen of the immunopositive cosmid clones did not yield immunopositive subclones, and one such cosmid clone produced a nonprotein antigen in Escherichia coli.
TI  - Bacterial killing ability of 10% ethylene oxide plus 90% hydrochlorofluorocarbon  sterilizing gas.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To use a serum and salt challenge in narrow-lumen carriers to evaluate a 10% ethylene oxide plus 90% hydrochlorofluorocarbon (EO-HCFC) sterilant mixture in a retrofitted 12/88 sterilizer as an alternative to the banned chlorofluorocarbon-ethylene oxide (EO) sterilant mixture. DESIGN: An EO-HCFC sterilizing gas mixture in a retrofitted 12/88 sterilizer was compared to 100% ethylene oxide (100% EO) sterilizing gas to determine its relative ability to kill seven different bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis spores, Bacillus stearothermophilus spores, Bacillus circulans spores, and Mycobacterium chelonei) in the presence or absence of a combined 10% serum and 0.65% salt challenge using both penicylinders (PC) and long narrow-lumen (LU) carriers. RESULTS: The EO-HCFC sterilant mixture (96% sterile carriers) was equivalent to the 100% EO sterilant (98% sterile carriers) for killing vegetative organisms, as well as spore suspensions, on the 27 PC and 27 LU carriers in the absence of serum and salt. In the presence of serum and salt, the EO-HCFC sterilant mixture was markedly better than the 100% EO sterilant at reducing the bacterial load on the 63 PC carriers (95% vs 62% sterile PC carriers, respectively), whereas both sterilizers were equivalent for the 63 LU carriers (49% vs 40% sterile LU carriers, respectively). Of the seven test organisms, E faecalis, B subtilis, B stearothermophilus, and B circulans were the most difficult to kill for both PC and LU carriers when serum and salt were present. CONCLUSIONS: The data presented in this report indicate that the EO-HCFC sterilant mixture is an effective alternative for gas sterilization. Indeed, the efficiency of bacterial killing for the EO-HCFC sterilant mixture was similar to that achieved by the 12/88 EO-CFC sterilant mixture.
TI  - [Survey of sensitivities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents (annual report)].
AB  - Research groups were formed in 20 institutions nationwide to investigate carbapenem resistance of clinical isolates. Activities of various antibacterial agents, principally carbapenems, were tested against clinical isolates collected from these institutions. The broth microdilution method was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 17 antibacterial agents for 1,326 strains of 11 bacterial species isolated at the institutions between October and December 1994. The results are as follows: 1. Carbapenems exhibited strong antibacterial activities against MSSA and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Their activities against Enterococcus faecalis were comparable to that of ABPC. Carbapenems showed low activities against MRSA. 2. OFLX exhibited the greatest antibacterial activity against Haemophilus influenzae, followed by MEPM. Antibacterial activities of the other carbapenems were comparable to those of FMOX, CTM, and ABPC. 3. The carbapenems showed high activities against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, and Bacteroides fragilis group. Their activities were greater than those exhibited by other beta-lactam antibacterial agents. The carbapenems also exhibited stronger antibacterial activities against Serratia marcescens than the other beta-lactam antibacterial agents, but some resistant strains were detected. 4. The antibacterial activities of carbapenems against Pseudomonas aeruginosa were comparable to those of CAZ, AZT, AMK.
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial activities of 2-[(alpha-methylbenzylidene)-hydrazino]benzoxazoles.
AB  - New 2-[(alpha-methylbenzylidene)hydrazino]benzoxazole derivatives have been synthesized by reacting ortho or para substituted acetophenones with 2-hydrazinobenzoxazole in ethanol. The structures of the synthesized compounds were confirmed by microanalysis, IR and NMR spectral data. Antimicrobial activities of the compounds were investigated by the microdilution susceptibility test in Mueller-Hinton broth and Sabouraud liquid medium. Test organisms: Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213 and Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212 as Gram (+) bacteria, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, ATCC 27853 as Gram (-) bacteria, and Candida albicans, Candida stellatoidea, Candida parapsilosis and Candida pseudotropicalis as yeasts. Among the compounds tested 2-[(alpha-methyl-4-chlorobenzylidene)hydrazino]benzoxazole (compounds 4) and 2-[(alpha-methyl-4-nitrobenzylidene)hydrazino]benzoxazole (compound 8) showed the most favorable activity.
TI  - Development of an antimicrobial susceptibility testing method suitable for performance during space flight.
AB  - Very little is known regarding the effects of the microgravity environment of space flight upon the action of antimicrobial agents on bacterial pathogens. This study was undertaken to develop a simple method for conducting antibacterial susceptibility tests during a space shuttle mission. Specially prepared susceptibility test research cards (bioMerieux Vitek, Hazelwood, Mo.) were designed to include 6 to 11 serial twofold dilutions of 14 antimicrobial agents, including penicillins, cephalosporins, a beta-lactamase inhibitor, vancomycin, erythromycin, tetracycline, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. MICs of the drugs were determined by visual reading of color end points in the Vitek research cards made possible by incorporation of a colorimetric growth indicator (alamarBlue; Accumed International, Westlake, Ohio). This study has demonstrated reproducible susceptibility results in the testing of isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, group A Streptococcus species, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli (beta-lactamase-positive and -negative strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In some instances, the MICs were comparable to those determined by a standard broth microdilution method, while in some cases the unique test media and format yielded slightly different values that were themselves reproducible. The proposed in-flight experiment will include inoculation of the Vitek cards on the ground prior to launch of the space shuttle, storage of inoculated cards at refrigeration temperature aboard the space shuttle until experiment initiation, and then incubation of the cards for 18 to 48 h prior to visual interpretation of MICs by the mission's astronauts. Ground-based studies have shown reproducible MICs following storage of inoculated cards for 7 days at 4 to 8 degrees C to accommodate the mission's time schedule and the astronaut's activities. For comparison, ground-based control (normal gravity) MIC values will be generated by simultaneous inoculation and incubation of a second set of test cards in a laboratory at the launch site. This procedure can provide for a safe and compact experiment that should yield new information on the effects of microgravity on the biological activities of various classes of antibiotics.

TI  - [The photometric determination of the antilysozyme activity of microorganisms].
AB  - The method for the determination of the antilysozyme activity (ALA) of microorganisms, based on the photometric determination of the residual activity of enzyme with the use of Micrococcus lysodeikticus test culture after the incubation of the strain under test and lysozyme, is proposed. The new method enhances the reliability of the determination of the ALA of microorganisms due to an increase in the accuracy of the quantitative determination of ALA. The elimination of the stage of interaction between the growing bacterial culture and lysozyme and the presence of the antilysozyme factor in the supernatant fluid confirm the constructive and secretory character of antilysozyme activity.
TI  - Susceptibility testing quality control studies with fosfomycin tromethamine.
AB  - Multiple studies were performed to define the quality control ranges for susceptibility tests of fosfomycin tromethamine. For disk diffusion tests, the limits proposed are 22 to 30 mm for Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and 25 to 33 mm for Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923. Broth microdilution tests were not reproducible. For agar dilution tests, ranges proposed are 0.5 to 2.0 micrograms/ml for Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, 0.5 to 4.0 micrograms/ml for Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213; 2.0 to 8.0 micrograms/ml for Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, and 32 to 128 micrograms/ml for Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212.
TI  - Construction of Escherichia coli-Bifidobacterium longum shuttle vector transforming B. longum 105-A and 108-A.
AB  - A shuttle vector, pBLES100, was constructed by cloning a Bifidobacterium longum plasmid and a gene encoding spectinomycin adenyltransferase AAD(9) from Enterococcus faecalis into the Escherichia coli vector pBR322. Stable transformants with this plasmid were obtained with an efficiency of 2.2 x 10(4) transformants/microgram DNA or 6.9 x 10(-5) transformants/cell/microgram DNA under the optimal conditions of 10.0 kV/cm, 200 omega, and 25 microF, using B. longum 105-A harvested at late log phase of growth.
TI  - A surface swab method for culturing Foley catheters assays the pericatheter (urethral) but not the urine (luminal) microbial population.
AB  - Assessment of the urethral flora in patients with indwelling bladder catheters is problematic in the presence of urinary tract infection (UTI). A new surface swab method that samples the external catheter surface without interference from contaminated luminal contents is described. In vitro, recovery of adherent bacteria from the external catheter surface by the surface swab method was proportional to the bacterial density as measured by a comparison scrape method. In a prospective longitudinal assessment of three chronically catheterized subjects with polymicrobial catheter-associated UTI, a conventional roll plate catheter culture method suggested substantial overlap between the urethral and urine microbial populations, possibly a result of contamination of catheter cultures by infected urine. In contrast, the surface swab method revealed little overlap between these floras, evidence suggesting a predominantly luminal (rather than meatal) route of UTI acquisition. The new surface swab method should prove useful in future studies of the pathogenesis and prevention of catheter-associated UTI.
TI  - Differential induction of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in whole blood by  bacteria: effects of antibiotic treatment.
AB  - The in vitro production of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), IL-6, and the IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) in whole blood upon stimulation with different bacterial strains was measured to study the possible relationship between disease severity and the cytokine-inducing capacities of these strains. Escherichia coli, Neisseria meningitidis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Bacteroides fragilis, Capnocytophaga canimorsus, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes induced the cytokines IL-1beta, IL-6, and IL-1ra. Gram-negative bacteria induced significantly higher levels of proinflammatory cytokine production than gram-positive bacteria. These differences were less pronounced for the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-1ra. In addition, blood was stimulated with E. coli killed by different antibiotics to study the effect of the antibiotics on the cytokine-inducing capacity of the bacterial culture. E. coli treated with cefuroxime and gentamicin induced higher levels of IL-1beta and IL-6 production but levels of IL-1ra production similar to that of heat-killed E. coli. In contrast, ciprofloxacin- and imipenem-cilastatin-mediated killing showed a decreased or similar level of induction of cytokine production as compared to that by heat-killed E. coli; polymyxin B decreased the level of production of the cytokines.
TI  - Evidence for regulation of the NADH peroxidase gene (npr) from Enterococcus faecalis by OxyR.
AB  - We report that the purified Escherichia coli OxyR protein can bind specifically upstream of the gene encoding NADH peroxidase (npr) from Enterococcus faecalis 10C1, to a site located some 144 bp from the promoter. A 34 kDa protein has been identified in crude extracts of E. faecalis that cross-reacts with polyclonal antisera to purified OxyR from E. coli and a protein(s) present in these extracts retards npr DNA fragments in gel shift assays. Taken together with the results of sequence analyses, these observations suggest that enterococcal npr is regulated by OxyR.
TI  - Does tea tree oil have a place in the topical treatment of burns?
AB  - Burnaid is a sorbalene-based cream containing 40 mg/g of tea tree oil and 1 mg/g  of triclosan. This investigation was carried out to determine the effect of Burnaid, a commercial tea tree oil preparation, against Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC29212), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC29213), Escherichia coli (ATCC25922), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC27853), with the activity of the base product in the commercial preparation. The organisms were suspended in sterile saline (0.5 McFarland Standard) and inoculated onto horse blood agar (E. faecalis and S. aureus) or Mueller-Hinton agar (E. coli and P. aeruginosa). One hundred microliters of Burnaid unsterilized, Burnaid sterilized and the base product (Tinasolve) were placed in duplicate in wells cut into the agar plates. Sterility and inactivation cultures were also performed on the samples. None of the samples were found to be contaminated with bacteria prior to testing. Only S. aureus and E. coli showed zones of growth inhibition around the Burnaid and Tinasolve. Zones of growth inhibition (22 mm) were similar for the active product (Burnaid) and the base (Tinasolve). There was no activity against E. faecalis or P. aeruginosa. In view of our findings and literature indicating the cytotoxicity of tea tree oil against human fibroblasts and epithelial cells, it is recommended that this product should not be used on burn wounds.
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial activity of beta-[(2-benzimidazolyl)thio]-beta-benzoyl styrene derivatives.
AB  - In this study some new beta-[(2-benzimidazolyl)thio]-beta-benzoyl styrene derivatives have been synthesized by reacting 2-(phenacetylthio)benzimidazole and substituted benzaldehydes in piperidine/dry benzene. Structures were verified by microanalysis, IR and NMR spectral analysis. Antimicrobial activities of the compounds were investigated by the microdilution susceptibility test; Muller-Hinton Broth and Sabouraud Dextrose Broth were used for the determination of antibacterial and antifungal activity. Test organisms: Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213 and Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212 as Gram (+) bacteria, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATTC 27853 as Gram (-) bacteria, and Candida albicans, Candida pseudotropicalis, Candida parapsilosis and Candida stellatoidea as yeast-like fungi. All the compounds showed good antimicrobial effect, especially against gram (+) bacteria. Among the compounds tested beta-[(2-benzimidazolyl)thio]-beta-benzoyl-4-chloro styrene (compound 9), beta-[(2-benzimidazolyl)thio]-beta-benzoyl-4-nitro styrene (compound 10) and beta-[(2-benzimidazolyl)thio]-beta-benzoyl-4-acetylamino styrene (compound 11) showed the most favorable activity.
TI  - In-vitro activity of trovafloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, against recent clinical isolates.
AB  - Trovafloxacin (CP-99,219) was very active against Gram-negative species examined  including Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Legionella spp., Neisseria spp. and Escherichia coli (MIC90s < or = 0.03 mg/L). In general trovafloxacin was twice as active as ofloxacin but only half as active as ciprofloxacin against Gram-negative species. Trovafloxacin was active against Gram-positive organisms, including Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Enterococcus faecalis (MIC90s < or = 0.25 mg/L). Against these organisms activity was eight to 16 times greater for trovafloxacin than for either ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin. In addition, Chlamydia spp., Mycoplasma spp. and Ureaplasma urealyticum were eight to 16 times more susceptible to trovafloxacin than to either ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin. These in-vitro data show that trovafloxacin is a broad-spectrum fluoroquinolone with greater activity against clinically important Gram-positive species compared with ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin.
TI  - In vitro activity of HSR-903, a new quinolone.
AB  - The in vitro activity of the new fluoroquinolone HSR-903 was compared with those  of ciprofloxacin, lomefloxacin, sparfloxacin, and levofloxacin. HSR-903 inhibited 90% of methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) clinical isolates at 0.78 and 1.56 microg/ml, respectively, and its activity against MRSA was 16-fold higher than those of sparfloxacin and levofloxacin and 64-fold higher than that of ciprofloxacin. The MICs at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited (MIC90s) of HSR-903 for Streptococcus pyogenes and penicillin G-susceptible and -resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP) were 0.10, 0.05, and 0.05 microg/ml, respectively. Against PRSP, the activity of HSR-903 was 4-fold higher than that of sparfloxacin and 32- to 256-fold higher than those of the other quinolones. The MIC90 of HSR-903 for Enterococcus faecalis was 0.20 microg/ml, and HSR-903 was more active than the other quinolones against enterococci. The activity of HSR-903 against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was roughly similar to that of ciprofloxacin and greater than those of the other quinolones. Against Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Helicobacter pylori, HSR-903 was the most potent of the quinolones tested. The activity of HSR-903 was not affected by the medium, the inoculum size, or the addition of serum, but decreased under acidic conditions, as did those of the other quinolones tested. HSR-903 exhibited rapid bactericidal action and had a good postantibiotic effect on S. aureus and P. aeruginosa. HSR-903 inhibited supercoiling by DNA gyrase from Escherichia coli, but it was much less active against human topoisomerase II.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of DU-6681a, a parent compound of novel oral carbapenem DZ-2640.
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activity of DU-6681a, a parent compound of DZ-2640, against gram-positive and -negative bacteria was compared with those of penems and cephalosporins currently available. MICs at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited (MIC90s) of the compound for clinical isolates of methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains, were 0.10, 25, and 12.5 microg/ml, respectively. DU-6681a inhibited the growth of all strains of Streptococcus pyogenes and of penicillin-susceptible and -insusceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae at 0.006, 0.025, and 0.20 microg/ml, respectively, and MIC90s of the compound were 6.25 and >100 microg/ml for Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium, respectively. MIC90s of DU-6681a were 0.20, 0.10, and 0.025 microg/ml for Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, respectively. For Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the MIC50 and MIC90 of DU-6681a were 25 and 50 microg/ml, respectively. DU-6681a activity was not affected by different media, varied inoculum size (10(4) to 10(7) CFU), or the addition of human serum but was decreased under acidic conditions against gram-negative bacteria, under alkaline conditions against gram-positive bacteria, and in human urine, as was the activity of the other antibiotics tested. The frequency of spontaneous resistance to DU-6681a was less than or equal to those of the reference compounds. Time-kill curve studies demonstrated the bactericidal action of DU-6681a against S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and H. influenzae.
TI  - Cloning and sequencing of two enterococcal glpK genes and regulation of the encoded glycerol kinases by phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent, phosphotransferase system-catalyzed phosphorylation of a single histidyl residue.
AB  - The glpK genes of Enterococcus casseliflavus and Enterococcus faecalis, encoding  glycerol kinase, the key enzyme of glycerol uptake and metabolism in bacteria, have been cloned and sequenced. The translated amino acid sequences exhibit strong homology to the amino acid sequences of other bacterial glycerol kinases. After expression of the enterococcal glpK genes in Escherichia coli, both glycerol kinases were purified and were found to be phosphorylated by enzyme I and the histidine-containing protein of the phosphoenolpyruvate:glycose phosphotransferase system. Phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphorylation caused a 9-fold increase in enzyme activity. The site of phosphorylation in glycerol kinase of E. casseliflavus was determined as His-232. Site-specific mutagenesis was used to replace His-232 in glycerol kinase of E. casseliflavus with an alanyl, glutamate, or arginyl residue. The mutant proteins could no longer be phosphorylated confirming that His-232 of E. casseliflavus glycerol kinase represents the site of phosphorylation. The His232 --> Arg glycerol kinase exhibited an about 3-fold elevated activity compared with wild-type glycerol kinase. Fructose 1,6-bisphosphate was found to inhibit E. casseliflavus glycerol kinase activity. However, neither EIIAGlc from E. coli nor the EIIAGlc domain of Bacillus subtilis had an inhibitory effect on glycerol kinase of E. casseliflavus.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity and durability of a novel antimicrobial-impregnated bladder catheter.
AB  - The main objective of this study was to examine the antimicrobial activity and durability of a novel indwelling bladder catheter impregnated with minocycline and rifampin. Thirty antimicrobial-impregnated bladder catheters were inserted transurethrally in spinal cord-injured patients and removed, in six groups of five catheters each, at 3, 7, 10, 14, 17 or 21 days. Removed catheters had detectable zones of inhibition against two different clinical isolates of each of the 10 tested uropathogens (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter diversus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus saprophyticus and Candida albicans) for greater than 14 days after catheter insertion. The residual zones of inhibition and levels of antimicrobial agents in removed catheters were both inversely related to the duration of catheter placement. Minocycline and rifampin were undetectable in serum and urine. These results support the ongoing efforts for examining the clinical efficacy of these experimental bladder catheters.
TI  - In-vitro microbiological assessment of a new penem, Men 10700.
AB  - The in-vitro antibacterial activity of Men 10700, a novel penem, has been compared with that of ritipenem, ciprofloxacin, amikacin, cefotaxime and co-amoxiclav against 539 strains taken from 17 genera. Men 10700 was most active against staphylococci and streptococci (MIC90 < 0.5 mg/L), slightly less active against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter spp., Citrobacter spp., Moraxella catarrhalis and peptostreptococci (MIC90 0.5-2 mg/L), moderately active against Enterococcus faecalis, members of the tribe Proteae, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter spp., clostridia and Bacteroides spp. (MIC90 4-16 mg/L), and inactive against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Enterococcus faecium. Its antibacterial spectrum is thus slightly less broad than that of imipenem, but it compares favourably with an oral third-generation cephalosporin. Men 10700 was more active than ritipenem against many species, especially Enterobacter spp. and Citrobacter spp.
TI  - Regulation of transfer of the Enterococcus faecalis pheromone-responding plasmid  pAD1: temperature-sensitive transfer mutants and identification of a new regulatory determinant, traD.
AB  - The enterococcal, conjugative, cytolysin plasmid pAD1 confers a mating response to the peptide sex pheromone cAD1 secreted by plasmid-free strains of Enterococcus faecalis. Cells carrying pAM714, a pAD1::Tn917 derivative with wild-type conjugation properties, were mutagenized with ethyl methanesulfonate to obtain variants that were induced (in the absence of pheromone) to transfer plasmid DNA upon shifting from 32 to 42 degrees C. Of 31 such mutants generated, the results of analyses of 7 are presented in detail. All seven strains were thermosensitive in the E. faecalis host FA2-2; colony morphology, clumping, and DNA transfer correlated well with each other at the two temperatures. In the nonisogenic host E. faecalis OG1X, however, only one derivative (pAM2725) exhibited correlation of all three traits at both temperatures. Three (pAM2700, pAM2703, and pAM2717) clumped and had colonies characteristic of pheromone-induced cells at 32 degrees C but transferred plasmid DNA at a higher frequency only at the elevated temperature. The other three (pAM2708, pAM2709, and pAM2712) were derepressed at both temperatures for all three characteristics. Four of the mutations, including that of pAM2725, mapped within the traA determinant, whereas two mapped identically in a previously unnoted open reading frame (designated traD) putatively encoding a short (23-amino-acid) peptide downstream of the inhibitor peptide determinant iad and in the opposite orientation. One mutant could not be located in the regions sequenced. Studies showed that the traA and traD mutations could be complemented in trans with a DNA fragment carrying the corresponding regions.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (1995). III. Differences in susceptibilities from previous years].
AB  - Susceptibilities to various antimicrobial agents were examined for Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa that were isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 11 hospitals during June, 1995 through May, 1996, and the results were compared with those obtained during the same period in earlier years. 1. Macrolide resistant E. faecalis isolated from uncomplicated UTIs during the latest study period appeared to have increased compared to those in previous study periods. More than 50% of the isolated E. faecalis during the latest study period were resistant to macrolide antibiotics, for the first time in our history. 2. No obvious changes were observed through the years for susceptibilities of S. aureus to various antimicrobial agents. Vancomycin (VCM) showed the highest activity against S. aureus, with MICs below 2 micrograms/ml or below. 3. Among E. coli strains, those with low susceptibilities to quinolones appeared to have increased over the years with MIC90 changed from between 0.125 microgram/ml or below and 0.5 microgram/ml in the 1989-1990 period to between 8 micrograms/ml and 128 micrograms/ml in the latest study period. 4. Klebsiella spp. showed higher resistance to most antimicrobial agents during periods of 1993-1994 and 1994-1995, but somewhat lower resistance during period of 1995-1996. No resistant Klebsiella spp. were detected from uncomplicated UTIs during the latest study period. 5. Among P. aeruginosa isolates from complicated UTIs, resistance isolates to gentamicin appeared to be increasing over the years. Resistant strains to quinolones were isolated at lower frequencies during periods of 1991-1994, but higher frequency was observed in the latest period, and MIC50s were between 0.5 and 4 micrograms/ml during 1991-1994, but were 16-32 micrograms/ml during 1995-1996. These susceptibility changes should be utilized in determining clinical treatments.
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial activity of 1-dialkylaminomethyl- 2-(p-substituted phenyl)-5-substituted benzimidazole derivatives.
AB  - 1-(Dialkylaminomethyl)-2-(p-substituted phenyl)-5-substituted benzimidazole derivatives 1 have been synthesized by reacting 2-phenylbenzimidazole derivatives with formaldehyde and a secondary amine. The derivatives of 2-phenylbenzimidazole were obtained by reacting the bisulfide addition product of substituted benzaldehydes with 4-substituted-o-phenylenediamines. Their structures were confirmed by microanalysis, IR and NMR spectral analysis. Antimicrobial activity of the compounds was investigated by the microdilution susceptibility test in Mueller-Hinton Broth and Sabouraud Dextrose Broth was used for the determination of antibacterial and antifungal activities. Test organisms: Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213 and Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212 as Gram-positive bacteria, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 as Gram-negative bacteria, and Candida albicans, C. parapsilosis, C. stellatoidea as yeast-like fungi. Compounds 1a, 1b, 1c, 1e and 1i showed slight to moderate activity against all microorganisms. Compound 1g showed the highest activity. It was found more potent than streptomycin against Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Synthesis by an alpha-glucosidase of glycosyl-trehaloses with an isomaltosyl residue.
AB  - Glycosyl-trehaloses with an isomaltosyl residue were synthesized by alpha-glucosidase from Aspergillus niger by using maltotetraose as a glucosyl donor and trehalose as the acceptor. The one trisaccharide and two tetrasaccharides formed were isolated by successive column chromatography. The results of an enzymatic digestion, methylation analysis, and 13C-NMR studies indicated that these oligosaccharides were alpha-isomaltosyl alpha-glucoside, alpha-isomaltotriosyl alpha-glucoside and alpha-isomaltoside. These oligosaccharides were not fermented to an acid by Streptococcus mutans, and they effectively inhibited water-insoluble glucan synthesis from sucrose by glucosyltransferase. In an in vitro utilization test with human intestinal bacteria, these oligosaccharides were predominantly utilized by Bifidobacteria.
TI  - Solar inactivation of faecal bacteria in water: the critical role of oxygen.
AB  - Suspensions of the faecal indicator bacteria Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis were incubated in full sunlight in plastic bottles containing either (i) air-equilibrated (oxygenated) water or (ii) anaerobic (deoxygenated) water. A rapid decrease in cfu ml-1 was observed for actively growing and stationary phase cells of both types of faecal bacteria when illuminated under aerobic conditions, with Ent. faecalis showing the greater enhancement in the rate of inactivation in air-equilibrated water. The demonstration of an oxygen requirement for the inactivation of faecal bacteria in sunlight indicates that solar-based water disinfection systems are likely to require fully aerobic conditions in order to function effectively.
TI  - Replication of coliphage Q beta as affected by host cell number, nutrition, competition from insusceptible cells and non-FRNA coliphages.
AB  - F-specific RNA (FRNA) coliphages, which infect Escherichia coli by attachment to  F pili, might serve as indicators of human enteric viruses in groundwater, provided these phages do not replicate in groundwater and replicate only to a limited extent in wastewater. Several factors that could influence phage replication in either of these environments were examined. Q beta did not replicate when host cells were fewer than 10(4) cfu ml-1. Replication selected for insusceptible cells when Q beta was incubated with its E. coli host. Loss of Q beta, presumably by inactivation, occurred in autoclaved on-site and urban wastewater, autoclaved groundwater, and in filter-sterilized spent LB broth. Replication did not occur in LB broth diluted with sterile saline to 1% of its original strength, which indicates that replication of FRNA coliphages cannot occur in such nutrient-poor environments as wastewater and groundwater. Competition from non-FRNA coliphages and insusceptible cells tended to reduce Q beta replication, as predicted, but phage yields unexpectedly increased significantly when Enterococcus faecalis was added to cultures.
TI  - DNA binding by the Xis protein of the conjugative transposon Tn916.
AB  - We purified the Xis protein of the conjugative transposon Tn916 and showed by nuclease protection experiments that Xis bound specifically to sites close to each end of Tn916. These specific binding sites are close to, and in the same relative orientation to, binding sites for the N-terminal domain of Tn916 integrase protein. These results suggest that Xis is involved in the formation of nucleoprotein structures at the ends of Tn916 that help to correctly align the ends so that excision can occur.
TI  - Cloning, nucleotide sequence and expression of a mannitol dehydrogenase gene from Pseudomonas fluorescens DSM 50106 in Escherichia coli.
AB  - A NAD-dependent mannitol dehydrogenase (MtlD) was purified to homogeneity from P. fluorescens DSM50106 and the N-terminal amino acid sequence was determined. An oligonucleotide deduced from this peptide sequence was used as a probe to isolate the mannitol dehydrogenase gene (mtlD) from a genomic library of P. fluorescens. Nucleotide sequence analysis of a 1.8 kb NruI fragment containing the entire mtlD gene revealed an open reading frame of 1482 bp encoding a protein with a calculated molecular weight of 54.49 kDa. The enzyme shared a high similarity with a mannitol dehydrogenase from Rhodobacter sphaeroides and a putative mannitol dehydrogenase of Saccharomyces cerevisae with an overall identity in amino acid sequence of 44% and 42%, respectively, whereas the similarity to mannitol-1-phosphate dehydrogenases of Escherichia coli or Enterococcus faecalis was only about 23% of identical amino acids. By construction of inducible expression plasmids the specific activity of the mannitol dehydrogenase synthesized in E. coli was increased from 0.02 U (mg protein)(-1) to 10 U (mg protein)(-1). After fusion of six histidine codons to the 3' end of mtlD gene and expression in E. coli active mannitol dehydrogenase could be purified in a two-step procedure by affinity chromatography using a Ni2+ matrix column. The purified enzyme exhibited a specific activity of 46 U (mg protein)(-1) and was shown to be a polyol dehydrogenase with a broad substrate spectrum oxidizing efficiently mannitol, sorbitol and arabitol.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (1995). II. Background of patients].
AB  - Clinical background was investigated on patients with urinary tract infections (UTIs) from whom 785 bacterial strains were isolated in 11 hospitals during the period from June, 1995 through May, 1996. 1. Distributions of age and sex of patients and type of infections. Among the patients examined, those with ages 50 years or older were the most frequent (males: 80.5%, females: 69.7%), and, among females, those with ages in the 20's were 12.6%. With regard to types of infections, more than a half of infections among males were of complicated types, but most of infections among females were of uncomplicated types, especially among females of ages less than 60 years. 2. Ages of patients and types of pathogens. The higher the ages of patients, the lesser became the isolation frequencies of Proteus spp. and Serratia spp., but the higher were those of Klebsiella spp. and Pseudomonas spp. 3. Effect of antibiotic use on isolation frequencies of pathogens. Use of antibiotics decreased pathogens isolated from patients with uncomplicated UTIs drastically (237 isolates before antibiotics compared to 33 after). Even isolated pathogens from patients with complicated UTIs decreased drastically with the use of antibiotics when indwelling catheters were not in use (200 isolates before antibiotics compared to 83 after), but when indwelling catheters were in use, antibiotics apparently failed to decrease the isolation frequency. 4. Surgical procedures and types of causative organisms for UTIs. Escherichia coli was the most frequently isolated organism from uncomplicated cases of UTIs. From cases of complicated UTIs without indwelling catheters, Enterococcus faecalis was the most frequently isolated, followed by E. coli, P. aeruginosa and Klebsiella spp. When a surgical procedures were not done, E. coli was isolated most frequently. From cases of complicated UTIs with indwelling catheters, P. aeruginosa, E. faecalis and S. aureus were the organisms that were mainly isolated, with isolation frequencies of 23.9%, 17.3% and 12.7%, respectively. When no surgical procedures were used, isolation frequencies of P. aeruginosa, Klebsiella spp. and E. faecalis were 25.7%, 14.3% and 14.3%, respectively.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (1995). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The frequencies of isolation and susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents were investigated on 704 bacterial strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 11 hospitals during the period of June 1995 to May 1996. Of the above bacterial isolates, Gram-positive bacteria accounted for 29.8% and a majority of them were Enterococcus faecalis. Gram-negative bacteria accounted for 70.2% and most of them were Escherichia coli. Susceptibilities of several isolated bacteria to antimicrobial agents were as followed; 1. Enterococcus faecalis Ampicillin (ABPC) and imipenem (IPM) showed the highest activities against E. faecalis isolated from patients with UTIs. The MIC90S of them were 1 microgram/ml. Vancomycin (VCM) and piperacillin (PIPC) were also active with the MIC90S of 2 micrograms/ml and 4 micrograms/ml, respectively. The others had low activities with the MIC90S of 16 micrograms/ml or above. 2. Staphylococcus aureus including MRSA VCM showed the highest activities against S. aureus isolated from patients with UTIs. Its MIC90 was 1 microgram/ml against both S. aureus and MRSA. Arbekacin (ABK) was also active with the MIC90 of 2 micrograms/ml. The other except minocycline (MINO) had very low activities with the MIC90S of 64 micrograms/ml or above. 3. Staphylococcus epidermidis ABK and MINO showed the strongest activities against S. epidermidis isolated from patients with UTIs. The MIC90S of them were 0.25 microgram/ml. VCM was also active with the MIC90 of 1 microgram/ml. The MIC90S of cephems ranged from 2 micrograms/ml to 16 micrograms/ml in 1994, but they ranged from 8 micrograms/ml to 128 micrograms/ml in 1995. These results indicated that some resistances existed among S. epidermidis to cephems. 4. Streptococcus agalactiae All drugs except gentamicin (GM) were active against S. agalactiae. ABPC, cefmenoxime (CMX), IPM, erythromycin (EM), clindamycin (CLDM) and clarithromycin (CAM) showed the highest activities. The MICs for all strains were lower than 0.125 microgram/ml. The MIC90S of the others were 2 micrograms/ml or below. 5. Citrobacter freundii IPM showed the highest activity against C. freundii isolated from patients UTIs. Its MIC90 was 1 microgram/ml. GM was also active with the MIC90 of 2 micrograms/ml. Cefpirome (CPR), cefozopran (CZOP) and amikacin (AMK) were also active with the MIC90S of 4 micrograms/ml. Penicillins and cephems except CMX, CPR and CZOP showed low activities with MIC90S of 256 micrograms/ml or above. 6. Enterobacter cloacae IPM showed the highest activity against E. cloacae. The MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 1 microgram/ml. MINO and tosufloxacin (TFLX) were also active with the MIC90S of 8 micrograms/ml. Penicillins and cephems except CPR and CZOP showed lower activities with the MIC90S of 256 micrograms/ml or above. 7. Escherichia coli. Most of the antimicrobial agents were active against E. coli. Particularly CPR, CZOP and IPM showed the highest activities against E. coli. The MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 0.5 microgram/ml. CMX and TFLX were also active with the MIC90S of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. Penicillins were slightly active with MIC90S of 128 micrograms/ml or above. 8. Klebsiella pneumoniae K. pneumoniae was susceptible to all drugs except penicillins, with MIC90S of 2 micrograms/ml or below. Carumonam (CRMN) had the strongest activity against K. pneumoniae, the MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 0.125 microgram/ml. Comparing with the result of 1994, the sensitivities of K. pneumoniae against all drugs had obviously changed into a better state. For example, the MIC90S of cephems ranged from 0.25 microgram/ml to 16 micrograms/ml in 1994, but they were all lower than 2 micrograms/ml in 1995. 9. Proteus mirabilis P. mirabilis was susceptible to a majority of drugs. CMX, ceftazidime (CAZ), cefixime (CFIX), and CRMN showed the highest activities against P. mirabilis isolated from patients with UTIs. MICs of CRMN for all
TI  - In vitro irradiation of infected root canals with a diode laser: results of microbiologic, infrared spectrometric, and stain penetration examinations.
AB  - This study aimed to examine the suitability of the diode laser with a wavelength  of 810 nm for reducing bacteria in root canals. Forty-four extracted, endodontically prepared teeth were inoculated with Escherichia coli and Streptococcus faecalis. No bacterial growth was observed when the teeth were irradiated at an output power of 4 W and a pulse rate of 10 milliseconds, with breaks of 10 milliseconds between the irradiations. Exposure time was five times 5 seconds. Infrared spectroscopic examinations revealed that irradiation at 4 W under even circling movements resulted in a maximum rise in temperature of 6 degrees C on the root surface. Stain penetration tests and scanning electron microscopic examinations revealed complete closure of the dentinal tubules on the irradiated root canal walls.
TI  - The effect of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) on bacterial translocation in the splenectomized rat.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: We created a study group in order to investigate the effects of  splenectomy and filgrastim. Filgrastim is an immunomodulator granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), that affects bacterial translocation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We created 3 study groups with 30 male Sprague-Dawley rats; the first group included sham splenectomy, the second group was splenectomy, and the third group was splenectomy+ filgrastim group. RESULTS: The mean bacterial colony count of the cecum were 2.5 x 10(9) in group 1, 1.2 x 10(10) in group 2 and 3.5 x 10(9) in group 3. The differences between these groups were accepted as statistically significant. The mean counts of the terminal ileum were 1.1 x 10(9) in group 1, 5.5 x 10(10) in group 2 and 2.5 x 10(10) in group 3. The p values of group 1-2 were 0.036 (statistically significant) and 0.123 in groups 2-3) were not statistically significant. The mean counts of the liver were 0.2 x 10(4), 1 x 10(10) and 3.4 x 10(5), respectively. In comparison of the groups the p values of the first and last 2 groups were found to be 0.047 (statistically significant). The mean counts of the mesenteric lymph node were 0.7 x 10(3), 1 x 10(10) and 0.9 x 10(6) respectively. The p values were 0.343 for the first and the last 2 groups both. As they were above 0.05, they were not statistically significant. The degrees of liver Kupffer cell hyperplasia were (+) 40%, (+2) 50% and (+3) 10% (group 1), (+) 10%, (+2) 40% and (+3) 50% (group 2), (+2) 60% and (+3) 40% (group 3) (p = 0.0039). The rates of the absence of pathology in mesenteric lymph nodes were 70% (group 1), 90% (group 2) and 100% (group 3) (p = 0.049). These findings were statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: We found that splenectomy has activated the whole predisposing factors of bacterial translocation and created the latter itself. In addition, we showed that filgrastim, a recently widespread used G-CSF, decreases bacterial translocation significantly.
TI  - Immersion in antibiotic solution prevents bacterial adhesion onto biodegradable prostatic stents.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether immersion in antibiotic solution reduces or prevents bacterial adhesion onto biodegradable prostatic stents. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pre-cut segments of polyglycolic acid (PGA) and polylactic acid (PLA) prostatic stents were incubated with two common uropathogenic bacterial strains (Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli) with and without previous immersion in antibiotic solution. Tobramycin, ceftriaxone and ciprofloxacin solutions were used, as these antibiotics are commonly administered for the prophylaxis and treatment of urinary tract infection (UTI). RESULTS: Immersion in ciprofloxacin solution prevented the adherence of both bacterial strains. Immersion in ceftriaxone solution prevented only the adherence of the E. coli strain. Immersion in tobramycin solution had no effect on either of the strains. The stent materials per se did not influence bacterial adhesion. After immersion in ciprofloxacin, the stent segments retained significant antibacterial activity even after one day's incubation in saline. CONCLUSION: Immersion in a suitable antibiotic solution may significantly reduce and even prevent bacterial adhesion onto biodegradable prostatic stents. Preventing bacterial adhesion may reduce the risk of UTI during the use of these devices.
TI  - Urine bactericidal activity of pefloxacin versus norfloxacin in healthy female volunteers after a single 800-mg oral dose.
AB  - In an open randomised crossover study the antibacterial activity of pefloxacin and norfloxacin was assessed in the urine after a single 800-mg oral dose in 14 healthy female volunteers. Pefloxacin demonstrated lower peak concentrations in the urine than norfloxacin (mean, 217.2 mg/l versus 492.9 mg/l as determined by the microbiological assay) but pefloxacin was present over a longer period of time in sufficient concentrations than norfloxacin. Mean urine levels of at least 2 mg/l were present for 7 days after pefloxacin administration and 2 days after norfloxacin administration as determined by the microbiological assay. Overall, the urinary recovery of pefloxacin and norfloxacin amounted to 49.3% and 25.1%, respectively, of the total administered dose. The average urine bactericidal activity against the five test organisms was as follows: against reference strain Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 susceptible to nalidixic acid (Nal-S) for 5 days with pefloxacin and 2 days with norfloxacin; against three clinical isolates, one strain each of E. coli resistant to nalidixic acid (Nal-R), Klebsiella pneumoniae Nal-R, and Staphylococcus saprophyticus, for 3 days with pefloxacin and 24 h with norfloxacin; and against a clinical isolate of Enterococcus faecalis for 2 days with pefloxacin and 12 h with norfloxacin. In conclusion, pefloxacin as a single dose proved to have sufficiently high and long-lasting urine bactericidal activity against urinary pathogens. These findings support the results of a meta-analysis of seven clinical trials in patients with uncomplicated lower UTI, demonstrating a single oral dose of 800 mg pefloxacin to be as effective as a conventional treatment with comparative drugs.
TI  - A novel gentamicin resistance gene in Enterococcus.
AB  - Enterococcus gallinarum SF9117 is a veterinary isolate for which the MIC of gentamicin is 256 micrograms/ml. Time-kill studies with a combination of ampicillin plus gentamicin failed to show synergism against SF9117. A probe representing aac(6')-aph(2") did not hybridize to DNA from SF9117. A 3.2-kb fragment from plasmid pYN134 of SF9117 was cloned and conferred resistance to gentamicin in Escherichia coli DH5 alpha. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed the presence of a 918-bp open reading frame whose deduced amino acid sequence had a region with homology to the C-terminal domain of the bifunctional enzyme AAC(6')-APH(2"). The gene is designated aph(2")-Ic, and its observed phosphotransferase activity is provisionally designated APH(2")-Ic. An intragenic probe hybridized to the genomic DNA from an Enterococcus faecium isolate from the peritoneal fluid of one patient and to the plasmid DNA of an Enterococcus faecalis isolate from the blood of another patient. An enterococcal isolate containing this novel resistance gene might not be readily detected in clinical laboratories that use gentamicin at 500 or 2,000 micrograms/ml for screening for high-level resistance.
TI  - Use of Tn917 to generate insertion mutations in the group A streptococcus.
AB  - The Enterococcus faecalis transposon Tn917 is functional in a broad range of bacteria, including both Gram-positive and Gram-negative species. We cloned Tn917-LTV3, a derivative carrying a promoterless lacZ (beta-galactosidase gene), into the thermosensitive shuttle replicon pG+host4 and assayed for chromosomal insertions in group A streptococcus (GAS). Tn917 transposed into the GAS chromosome at a frequency of (2.8 +/- 3.2) x 10(-5) per colony forming unit (cfu). Transposition products were predominantly simple insertions and no target site preference was detectable. Some transcriptional fusions were identified in which the promoterless lacZ of the transposon appeared to be expressed from an external promoter.
TI  - Specific species of intestinal bacteria influence the induction of aberrant crypt foci by 1,2-dimethylhydrazine in rats.
AB  - To shed light on the association of intestinal microflora with the development of colon cancer, we studied the modifying effects of intestinal microflora on the occurrence of 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH)-induced colonic aberrant crypt foci (ACF) in germfree (GF), gnotobiotic (GB) and conventionalized (Cvd) rats. In the first part of this study, 10 week old germfree Fischer-344 rats were randomly assigned to three groups and two groups of rats were orally inoculated with mixtures of pure culture of Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecium, and several strains of Bacteroides and Clostridium species (GB), or feces from conventional rats (Cvd). Inoculated rats were given two weekly i.p. injections of DMH (20 mg/kg body wt) at 13 and 14 weeks of age. Rats were sacrificed 11 or 34 weeks after the last DMH injection for ACF scoring. The total number of ACF, ACF with four or more crypts/focus, and mean number of aberrant crypts per focus (crypt multiplicity) in GB rats sacrificed at week 34 were 168% (P < 0.001), 442% (P < 0.001) and 138% (P < 0.001) of those in GF rats, respectively. On the other hand, the same values in Cvd rats were 42% (P < 0.001), 147% (P = 0.246) and 159% (P < 0.001) of those in GF rats, respectively. Similar results were observed in rats that were sacrificed at week 11. In the second part of this study, the effect of colonization of Bifidobacterium breve on the ACF profiles was examined in GB rats. The number of ACF with four or more crypts/focus and crypt multiplicity in GB plus B. breve rats at week 11 were significantly lower than those of GB rats (P < 0.01, and P < 0.05, respectively), although the former was not statistically significant at week 34. These findings suggest that some intestinal bacteria might behave as promoters and some as anti-promoters in colon carcinogenesis.
TI  - Tissue penetration of Meropenem in patients undergoing gynecologic surgery.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to assess the tissue-penetrating ability of a new beta-lactam antibiotic, meropenem, in 64 patients undergoing elective gynecologic surgery. Patients received a single 500-mg dose intravenously before surgery. Plasma and tissue concentrations of meropenem were highest at approximately 1 hour, and good tissue penetration was seen in the variety of specimens evaluated. The median plasma concentration at approximately 1 hour was 13.3 micrograms/mL. The median fluid and tissue concentrations at approximately 1 hour were as follows: cervix, 8.5 micrograms/g; endometrium, 2.3 micrograms/g; fallopian tube, 1.9 micrograms/g; myometrium, 3.6 micrograms/g; ovary, 2.3 micrograms/g; and uterus, 2.3 micrograms/g. These tissue concentrations exceed the MICs of meropenem for 90% of typical pathogens associated with gynecologic infections. Meropenem readily penetrates gynecologic tissue. A single 500-mg dose provides adequate tissue concentrations for treatment of gynecologic infections caused by susceptible pathogens.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents. Special references to bacteria isolated between July 1995 and June 1996].
AB  - Isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery during the period from July  1994 to June 1995 were investigated in a multicenter study in Japan, and the following results were obtained. One hundred and sixty-four strains were isolated from primary infections, and 202 strains were isolated from postoperative infections. From primary infections, anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant, while from post operative infections, aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant. Among aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Enterococcus faecalis was the highest, followed by that of Staphylococcus aureus from postoperative infections. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Peptostreptococcus spp. was the highest from both types of infections. Among anaerobic Gram-negative, Escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in this order, and from postoperative infections, P. aeruginosa was the most predominantly isolated, followed by Enterobacter spp. and Klebsiella spp. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of Bacteroides fragilis group was the highest from both types of infections. We noticed that MICs of cefazolin against three out of 23 strains of E. coli were higher than 100 micrograms/ml. Among anaerobic bacteria, there were many resistant strains against penicillins and cephems with MICs higher than 100 micrograms/ml, and the same trend was observed among other Bacteroides spp. and Prevotella spp.
TI  - Comparison of the bactericidal activities of piperacillin-tazobactam, ticarcillin-clavulanate, and ampicillin-sulbactam against clinical isolates of Bacteroides fragilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - Owing to the broad spectrum of activity afforded by beta-lactam-beta-lactamase inhibitor preparations, these agents are frequently selected as empiric therapy for the treatment of mixed infections such as intra-abdominal and diabetic foot infections, either alone or in combination with an aminoglycoside. Twelve healthy volunteers were enrolled in a randomized, open-label, four-way crossover trial comparing the bactericidal activities of piperacillin-tazobactam, ticarcillin-clavulanate, and ampicillin-sulbactam against microorganisms commonly isolated from mixed infections. Subjects received the following regimes: (i) 3.375 g of piperacillin-tazobactam intravenously (i.v.) every 6 h (q6h) (ii) 4.5 g of piperacillin-tazobactam i.v. q8h, (iii) 3.1 g of ticarcillin-clavulanate i.v. q6h, and (iv) 3.0 g of ampicillin-sulbactam i.v. q6h. Serum bactericidal titers were determined and used to calculate the duration of measurable bactericidal activity over the dosing interval of each of the regimens against two clinical isolates of Bacillus fragilis, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The percentage of the dosing interval over which drug concentrations in serum remained above the MIC for each organism was determined and compared with the observed duration of bactericidal activity was noted (r = 0.78; P < 0.001). All of the regimens demonstrated good activity against B. fragilis and E. coli. Against E. faecalis and P. aeruginosa, however, all of the regimens provided bactericidal activity for less than 50% of the respective dosing intervals. These data suggest that use of shorter dosing intervals or continuous-infusion regimens should be considered in combination with an aminoglycoside to improve the bactericidal profiles of these agents for E. faecalis and P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Urinary tract infection in acute appendicitis.
AB  - The effect of acute appendicitis (AA) on aerobic urinary tract infection was investigated. Abnormal urinalysis and urinary tract infection in patients with AA have seldom been reported previously. Appendectomy was performed in 84 patients with no previous urogenital, retroperitoneal, or pelvic disease, trauma or operation and AA was pathologically confirmed in 66 of them. Aerobic cultures of appendiceal tissue and mesenteriolum were done. Control groups included 25 patients with inguinal hernioplasty and 40 patients with varicocele repair. Urinalysis and urine culture were done prior to operation, and on days 1, 3, and 6 postoperatively. The "O" serogrouping identification of Escherichia coli (E. coli) was performed in the appendix, mesenteriolum and urine. Abnormal urinalysis was found in 48% of patients with AA before appendectomy, and in 12% on day 6 postoperatively (P < 0.05). Aerobes were isolated from urine in 32% of patients before appendectomy and in 24% on day 6 following surgery. E. coli was more often found in the appendix than in the mesenteriolum (P < 0.05). In seven out of 66 patients (11%) bacteriuria of more than 10(5) was found. All of them had identical aerobic strain isolated from the appendix, mesenteriolum and urine (E. coli in 4, Streptococcus faecalis in 2 and Corynebacterium species in one patient) according to antimicrobial susceptibility testing and "O" serogrouping of E. coli. Lower urinary tract infection was clinically manifested on day 3 postoperatively in 4 of them and in none from the control groups. Bacteria spreading from the appendix to the retroperitoneal space may invade the urinary tract and cause either symptomatic or asymptomatic urinary tract infection in patients with AA.
TI  - Glucose starvation response in Enterococcus faecalis JH2-2: survival and protein  analysis.
AB  - We investigated the survival of Enterococcus faecalis following starvation provoked by energy source glucose exhaustion. Inhibition of protein synthesis by chloramphenicol before 3 h of starvation resulted in a dramatic decrease in viable bacteria. Antibiotic treatment of cells after 3 or 6 h of starvation had a progressively lesser influence on bacterial survival. During the first 24 h of deprivation, a total of 42 proteins were identified as glucose-starvation-inducible; 4 temporal classes of proteins (A, B, C and D) were defined in relation to their enhanced synthesis after glucose exhaustion. Our results show that proteins from the two early classes (A and B) seem to be the most important for long-term survival in E. faecalis. One protein of each of these classes was analysed at the molecular level. The N-terminal sequence of one of them, belonging to class A, showed strong homology with the N-terminal sequence of carbamate kinase from Streptococcus faecium. This enzyme could be implicated in the development of alternative metabolic pathways of energy production and could be compared to the Cst proteins of Escherichia coli.
TI  - The joint of Tn916 circular intermediates is a homoduplex in Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - Tn916 is a 18-kb conjugative transposon originally identified in Enterococcus faecalis. The first step for Tn916 movement is its excision from the donor replicon with the formation of a nonreplicating covalently closed circular intermediate. Studies on formation of circular intermediates in Escherichia coli have shown that the joint between the Tn916 termini is a 6-bp heteroduplex formed by the two regions flanking the transposon before its excision (coupling sequences). In this work we studied the joint of Tn916 termini in circular intermediates formed in both E. coli and E. faecalis. Our strategy was to use direct sequencing of amplification products obtained from the joint region of single target molecules. In E. coli, 50% of circular intermediates contained a heteroduplex joint, while the remaining 50% displayed a homoduplex joint formed by one of the two coupling sequences. In E. faecalis, we could not demonstrate the presence of any heteroduplex joint. In this case 77.7% of the analyzed joints were formed by the left coupling sequence.

TI  - Relationship between the thermotolerance and the increase of DnaK and GroEL synthesis in Enterococcus faecalis ATCC19433.
AB  - Relationship between intrinsic thermal resistance, thermotolerance and heat shock proteins (hsp) synthesis is studied in Enterococcus faecalis. We showed that an impressive phenotypic heat resistance was induced by mild heat and a slight thermotolerance was developed by various sublethal pretreatments such as NaCl, SDS and bile salts. Hydrogen peroxide, acid and alkaline shifts or "thermomimetic" agent such as ethanol, did not enhance the survival of adapted cells against the lethal thermal shock (62 degrees C). The inhibition of protein synthesis by chloramphenicol or rifampin abolished thermotolerance. The immunological identification of the DnaK and GroEL proteins in E. faecalis allowed to study induction of these molecular chaperones under various conditions. Heat was the most efficient inductor of DnaK and GroEL synthesis. However, it was surprising that ethanol did not strongly induce these proteins. We also show that amplification of these hsp is not correlated to acquired thermotolerance with a linear relationship. A weak thermotolerance is not coupled from increased synthesis of DnaK and GroEL. So, we postulate that the high synthesis of the major hsp is not obligatory in the thermal cross-protection but that de novo protein synthesis is an absolute necessity in E. faecalis. Activation of preformed hsp or other factors depending or not on protein synthesis may be also necessary to enhance thermal resistance.
TI  - Validation of Etest for seven antimicrobial agents using regulatory criteria for  the assessment of antimicrobial susceptibility devices.
AB  - Etest, a stable-gradient antimicrobial susceptibility test method (AB Biodisk, Solna, Sweden), was compared to the agar dilution method for tests with amikacin, tobramycin, aztreonam, cefdinir, cefprozil, ceftazidime and sparfloxacin. The study design followed recommended guidelines for 510(k) application by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Results demonstrated Etest accuracy (MIC +/- 1.0 log2 dilutions compared to agar dilution MIC) to be 90.4% with only one of 1150 comparisons showing a reproducible variation of 2 log2 dilutions. Categorical equivalency was > or = 92% for all drugs except ceftazidime (82 to 89%), but false-susceptible error was rare (< 0.1%). Etest was very reproducible (100% of results +/- 1.0 log2 dilution) and quality control results conformed to published MIC ranges. The Etest seems to render accurate results for these seven antimicrobial agents evaluated.
TI  - The origin of transfer (oriT) of the enterococcal, pheromone-responding, cytolysin plasmid pAD1 is located within the repA determinant.
AB  - The highly conjugative pAD1 plasmid encodes a mating response to the peptide sex  pheromone cAD1 secreted by recipient strains of Enterococcus faecalis. The location of the origin of transfer (oriT) was determined through the ability to mobilize the Escherichia coli-E. faecalis shuttle plasmid pAM401 carrying specific segments of pAD1. The oriT sequence was found to be completely within the repA determinant known to be required for plasmid maintenance.
TI  - [Adhesive properties of bacteria isolated from patients with urinary tract infection to the urinary bladder].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clinically isolated Staphylococcus epidermidis KK3-75, Enterococcus faecalis SMU-14, and Escherichia coli TF6-27 were subjected to test for bladder lodgments. METHODS: Experimental cystitis on mice was investigated pathologically by light, confocal laser, and electron microscope after intravesical injection of cell suspensions of the strains. Bacterial affinities with bladder mucosal proteins and with extracellular components were detected by Western blot analysis. RESULTS: Pathological findings of experimental cystitis revealed prominent infiltration of neutrophils except for those that were challenged with Enterococcus faecalis SMU-14. Capsule-like structures were demonstrated for the other two strains. Each strain showed histological tropism within the tissue sections, which correlated with the capability to bind the respective extracellular matrix components tested. Type I collagen bound only to cellular extracts of Enterococcus faecalis SMU-14 and Escherichia coli TF6-27, whereas fibronectin and type IV collagen bound only to those of Staphylococcus epidermidis KK3-75 and Enterococcus faecalis SMU-14. Bladder mucosal proteins had a variety of ability to bind cell surface proteins of each strain. Bacterial cell surface binding of all except for two of the bladder mucosal proteins detected was inhibited by extracellular matrix components. CONCLUSION: These experimental results suggest that the bacterial affinity of the bladder restricted by strain specific cell surface properties may be important for explanation in the difference of occurrence and progression of urinary tract infections caused by each strain.
TI  - Alterations in the chemical composition of peptidoglycan of Escherichia coli DH5  alpha induced by the expression of Enterococcus faecalis penicillin binding protein 5.
AB  - Low-affinity penicillin binding proteins (PBPs) are a particular class of membrane proteins involved in penicillin resistance in Enterococci and other micro-organisms. This PBP is thought to be capable of taking over the activity of all other PBPs during peptidoglycan synthesis. Unfortunately, nothing is known about the enzymatic activity catalyzed by this PBP, but a transpeptidase/transglycosylase action can be postulated to allow complete peptidoglycan synthesis. Recently, we cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli the PBP5 (a low-affinity PBP) of Enterococcus faecalis (Signoretto, C., Boaretti, M., and Canepari, P.: FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 123, 99-106, 1994). Here we describe some of the effects of this PBP when expressed in E. coli, in terms of increased growth rate and autolysis, and particularly its effects on the fine chemical composition of the E. coli peptidoglycan. A distinct increase in the di- and tripeptide monomers and a parallel decrease in the tetrapeptide monomer are described. The results presented here are explained in terms of a partial action of the postulated transpeptidase/ transglycosylase enzymatic complex which leads to the cleavage of one, two or three amino-acids from the pentapeptide monomer, but is incapable of performing the cross-linking between two side-chains due to lack of the natural substrate which is different from that of E. coli.
TI  - Bacterial strains isolated from eggs and their resistance to currently used antibiotics: is there a health hazard for consumers?
AB  - In order to study the putative transfer of antibiotic resistance from poultry to  humans, hens' eggs were examined for the presence of various pathogens. Staphylococcus, Enterobacter, Escherichia, Proteus and Pseudomonas spp. were the most frequently isolated genera. Sensitivity tests, performed with the Kirby-Bauer technique, showed the presence of resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus (to penicillin-G, tetracycline, erythromycin, clindamycin, cefalosporins, oxacillin, gentamycin, chloramphenicol and tobramycin), Enterococcus faecalis (to ampicillin, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, gentamycin and tetracyclin), Escherichia coli (to tetracycline, erythromycin, ampicillin and cefalosporins), Enterobacter cloacae (to ampicillin, amoxycillin plus clavunalic acid, erythromycin and tetracycline), Pseudomonas stutzeri (to erythromycin and chlorampenicol) and Citrobacter freundii (to ampicillin, amoxycillin plus clavunalic acid, cefalosporins and co-trimoxazole).
TI  - Evidence of the proinflammatory role of Enterococcus faecalis in polymicrobial peritonitis in rats.
AB  - Although the role of members of the Enterobacteriaceae and anaerobes in the pathogenesis of intra-abdominal infections has been extensively demonstrated, the role played by enterococci in these infections remains controversial. The pathophysiological mechanisms induced by enterococci in intra-abdominal infection were studied in a nonfatal model of peritonitis in rats by implanting a gelatin capsule containing Escherichia coli and Bacteroides fragilis with or without increasing concentrations of Enterococcus faecalis or heat-inactivated enterococci. The ability of the rat peritoneal cavity to sterilize itself after bacterial challenge was evaluated by quantifying the inflammatory response in the peritoneal cavity, reflected by both phagocyte and cytokine responses. Effects were evaluated 6, 12, and 24 h and 3 and 6 days after inoculation. On day 6 after inoculation, the highest enterococcal concentration (10(8) CFU/ml) was accompanied by significantly increased concentrations of E. coli in peritoneal fluid and peritoneal phagocytes when compared to other groups. In the first 12 h after inoculation, tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-6 concentrations were significantly increased in the peritoneal fluid of the animals that had received the highest inoculum of enterococci or heat-inactivated enterococci. In the late period of the study (3 and 6 days), significantly increased leukocyte counts were observed in the peritoneal fluid of these animals. These results suggest that E. faecalis somehow inhibited phagocytosis and intracellular killing of the other pathogens and also played an inflammatory role, which might account for the bacterial synergy observed in this model.
TI  - [Clinically isolated bacterii seen in complicated infections].
AB  - The spectrum of causative bacterial agents responsible for post-operative infections in the surgical field have dramatically changed with time. This could be due to recent technical progress in bacterial extraction or the result of more effective antibiotics used post-operatively. Nevertheless nosocomial infections including those caused by MRSA still demand our close attention. Commonly extracted bacterii include Staphylococcus spp., E. faecalis, E. coli, Klebsiella spp., E. cloacae, P. aeruginosa and Bacteroides spp., but with regards to pathogenicity, extraction frequency and drug resistance, agents requiring the highest note of caution may be MRSA, P. aeruginosa and Bacteroides spp. MRSA is still the bacterium which makes the most frequent appearance in the clinical field, and the only effective antibiotic to MRSA is vancomycin. In addition, P. aeruginosa is the most common bacterial agent seen in post-operative infections and also the agent to which many of the cephem drugs do not express a high degree of antibacterial effect. Furthermore, about half of the Bacteroides spp. are beta-lactamase-producing strains which deactive the effect of penicillin and cephem drugs within the infection site. A drug which proves effective against E. coli may nevertheless become somewhat ineffective against this agent when found in a mixed infection and if the drug lacks stability against beta-lactamase. Clinically, mixed infections including some or even all the above agents are known to occur, continuously drawing our close attention.
TI  - [The pathophysiology and treatment of severe intra-abdominal abscess].
AB  - Formation of an abscess within the peritoneal cavity is a dynamic process, representing the body's success at localizing the contamination but its ultimate failure to completely destroy the bacteria and neutralize their toxic products. In most instances, the origin of the microbial insult is from bacteria which colonize the intestinal lumen. The therapeutic means are prompt surgical drainage and appropriately administered antimicrobial agents. Surgical drainage of abscess are accompanied by either (1) an extraperitoneal approach, (2) an intra-abdominal exploration, or (3) ultrasound-guided needle aspiration of the abscess. Choice of antimicrobial agents is frequently based upon prediction of pathogens from normal flora of bowel contents contaminating a normally sterile area, or from knowledge of pathogens expected in certain conditions, rather than on results of cultures and susceptibility tests. This selection frequently calls for the choice of agents effective against multiple organisms. Patients with prolonged septic courses die from a combination of the infection itself and the malnutrition resulting from the associated hypercatabolism and starvation. Nutritional therapy also of clinical importance in halting the progression toward a fatal outcome.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of trovafloxacin (CP-99,219).
AB  - Trovafloxacin was found to be a typical quinolone producing a biphasic dose response against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pneumoniae. A reduced rate of kill was seen against Enterococcus faecalis, which is also typical of the quinolones. However, the bactericidal activity of trovafloxacin against S. aureus and S. pneumoniae was greater than most other quinolones previously tested. The enhanced bactericidal activity of trovafloxacin against S. aureus may be explained by the possession of a very strong bactericidal mechanism B. Trovafloxacin may prove to be a quinolone of choice against S. aureus infections.
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial activity of electron rich olefin derived cyclic ureas.
AB  - Seventeen cyclic ureas containing imidazolidine and benzimidazoline nuclei were synthesised by the reaction of electron-rich olefins with appropriate group 16 elements. (O, S, Se, Te). The compounds synthesised were identified by 1H, 13C-NMR, FT-IR and mass spectroscopic techniques and micro analysis. All compounds studied in this work were screened for their in vitro antimicrobial activity against standard strains: Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29212), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 29213), Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853). Eight of the compounds were found effective to inhibit the growth of Gram-positive bacteria (Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus) at MIC values between 25-400 micrograms/ml. None of the compounds exhibit antimicrobial activity against gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) at the concentrations studied (6.25-800 micrograms/ml).
TI  - Development of fluoroquinolone resistance in Enterococcus faecalis and role of mutations in the DNA gyrase gyrA gene.
AB  - We have analyzed the development of fluoroquinolone resistance between 1986 and 1993 among clinical isolates of Enterococcus faecalis from a French hospital. One hundred randomly selected isolates per year were screened for resistance to ciprofloxacin (MIC > 2 micrograms/ml) and for high-level resistance to gentamicin (MIC > 1,000 micrograms/ml). The percentages of ciprofloxacin-resistant strains for these years were as follows: 1986, 0; 1987, 1; 1988 to 1989, 2; 1990, 6; 1991, 16; 1992, 24; and 1993, 14. Eighty-three percent of the ciprofloxacin-resistant isolates were coresistant to high levels of gentamicin. Forty-eight high-level gentamicin-resistant E. faecalis strains, which were resistant (24 strains) or susceptible (24 strains) to ciprofloxacin, were examined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) of SmaI-digested total DNA. Numerous PFGE types were observed among the ciprofloxacin-susceptible isolates, whereas one type was largely predominant among the ciprofloxacin-resistant strains, which suggests that the increase in fluoroquinolone resistance was due to the spread of a single clone. A 241-bp fragment of gyrA, corresponding to the quinolone resistance-determining region, was amplified and sequenced for seven ciprofloxacin-resistant isolates. Six strains had high levels of resistance (MICs, 32 to 64 micrograms/ml) and had a mutation at position 83 (Escherichia coli coordinates) from Ser to Arg (three strains) or to Ile (two strains) or at position 87 from Glu to Gly (one strain), whereas the low-level-resistant isolate (MIC, 8 micrograms/ml) had no mutations.
TI  - Beta-lactam stability in frozen microdilution PASCO MIC panels using strains with known resistance mechanisms as biosensors.
AB  - The stability of amoxicillin/clavulanate, piperacillin/tazobactam, cefepime, imipenem, and meropenem in PASCO (PASCO System, DIFCO Laboratories, Detroit, MI, USA) frozen microdilution susceptibility panels stored for 16 weeks at -20 degrees C and -70 degrees C was evaluated. The increase in MIC values for the five American-Type Culture Collection (ATCC) quality control strains for susceptibility testing recommended by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) and for 13 strains with different well-characterized resistance mechanisms was indicative of bioactivity deterioration. The overall agreement (+/- 1 twofold dilution) at purchase between the MIC values of PASCO frozen microdilution susceptibility panels and the standard agar dilution method was 97.7%. Minimum inhibitory concentration values for the associations of amoxicillin/clavulanate and piperacillin/tazobactam remained unchanged for the study period at -70 degrees C. In contrast, a carbapenem bioactivity decrease was detected only with strains having well-characterized resistance mechanisms from the 12th week onwards. At -20 degrees C, antibiotic deterioration with these latter strains was observed earlier than with ATCC strains: the activity of meropenem and imipenem remained unchanged only for the first 2 weeks, while a loss of activity was detected for amoxicillin/clavulanate and piperacillin/tazobactam at the 7th and 10th week, respectively. Cefepime was highly stable both at -20 degrees C and -70 degrees C. Strains with well-characterized resistance mechanisms should be used in routine quality control studies of antibiotic stability for susceptibility testing panels during the storage period.
TI  - Efficacy of ABT-719, a 2-pyridone antimicrobial, against enterococci, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in experimental murine pyelonephritis.
AB  - ABT-719 is a 2-pyridone antimicrobial which inhibits DNA gyrase activity. It has  considerable subcutaneous (sc) and oral efficacy in the treatment of experimental pyelonephritis induced in carrageenan-treated mice by clinical isolates of Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Therapeutic ED50s, defined here as producing a 2 log10 reduction in kidney bacterial burden, provide a reliable end point for comparison of drug efficacy in this experimental infection. Therapeutic ED50s for ABT-719 against these infections were equal to or up to ten-fold lower than those for ciprofloxacin, used as a reference because of similarity in mode of action. Against E. faecalis, the therapeutic ED50s for ABT-719 were 4.5-13.6 mg/kg.day for sc administration and 6.8-8.9 mg/kg.day for oral administration. ABT-719 was more potent than ciprofloxacin and vancomycin against the E. faecalis strains, which showed ciprofloxacin and vancomycin resistance covering a range of MICs. Against E. faecium, the therapeutic ED50s for ABT-719 were 8.8 mg/kg.day (sc) and 9.4 mg/kg.day (oral). Against an isolate of E. faecium showing ciprofloxacin and vancomycin resistance the ED50 for ABT-719 to achieve a 1 log10 reduction in kidney bacterial burden was 17.9 mg/kg.day by sc administration. While ABT-719 had lower efficacy against this isolate than against others, ciprofloxacin and vancomycin failed to show efficacy. Against E. coli, the therapeutic ED50 for ABT-719 was 1.1 mg/kg.day (oral), and against P. aeruginosa, this value was 2.7 mg/kg.day (oral) with values against both of these pathogens similar to those for ciprofloxacin. ABT-719, which represents the new 2-pyridone compound class, has promise for the treatment of urinary tract infections, as suggested by the significant efficacy seen against experimental pyelonephritis caused by E. coli, P. aeruginosa and susceptible and resistant enterococci.
TI  - Specificity of induction of glycopeptide resistance genes in Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - Regulation of VanA- and VanB-type glycopeptide resistance in enterococci is mediated by related two-component regulatory systems (VanR-VanS and VanRB-VanSB). The transglycosylase inhibitors vancomycin, teicoplanin, and moenomycin induced synthesis of the VanX D,D-dipeptidase in a VanA-type Enterococcus faecalis harboring transposon Tn1546. Inhibitors of reactions immediately preceding (ramoplanin) or following (penicillin G and bacitracin) transglycosylation were not inducers. These results identify accumulation of membrane-bound lipid intermediate II as a potential signal for induction of VanA-type resistance. In E.faecalis BM4281 harboring a wild vanB genetic element, D,D-dipeptidase synthesis was only inducible by vancomycin. Induction of the production of the VanB ligase by vancomycin was required for growth of a vancomycin-dependent derivative of BM4281, since introduction of a plasmid coding for constitutive synthesis of the VanA ligase eliminated the requirement of glycopeptide for growth. Both vancomycin and teicoplanin were able to induce D,D-dipeptidase synthesis in BM4281 derivatives that were vancomycin and teicoplanin resistant or vancomycin and teicoplanin dependent. Acquisition of teicoplanin resistance in the latter types of strains was due to alteration in induction specificity associated with an increase in the sensitivity of the regulatory system to vancomycin. Thus, the wild VanRB-VanSB system is unable or not sensitive enough to sense teicoplanin, although mutations can lead to recognition of this antibiotic.
TI  - A simulation of microbial competition in the human colonic ecosystem.
AB  - Many investigations of the interactions of microbial competitors in the gastrointestinal tract used continuous-flow anaerobic cultures. The simulation reported here was a deterministic 11-compartment model coded by using the C programming language and based on parameters from published in vitro studies and assumptions were data were unavailable. The resource compartments were glucose, lactose and sucrose, starch, sorbose, and serine. Six microbial competitors included indigenous nonpathogenic colonizers of the human gastrointestinal tract (Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Bacteroids ovatus, Fusobacterium varium, and Enterococcus faecalis) and the potential human enteropathogen Salmonella typhimurium. Flows of carbon from the resources to the microbes were modified by resource and space controls. Partitioning of resources to the competitors that could utilize them was calculated at each iteration on the basis of availability of all resources by feeding preference functions. Resources did not accumulate during iterations of the model. The results of the computer simulation of microbial competition model and for various modifications of the model. The results were based on few measured parameters but may be useful in the design of user-friendly software to aid researchers in defining and manipulating the microbial ecology of colonic ecosystems as relates to food-borne disease.
TI  - Is the ability of urinary tract pathogens to accumulate glycine betaine a factor  in the virulence of pathogenic strains?
AB  - The regulation of intracellular concentrations of organic solutes, including glycine betaine, is an important adaptive response to osmotic stress for Escherichia coli. The clinical significance of glycine betaine to uropathogens is not clear. Clinical isolates of E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter species, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Staphylococcus aureus, S. saprophyticus, and Enterococcus faecalis accumulated glycine betaine from hyperosmotic media. The addition of glycine betaine to hyperosmotic minimal medium accelerated the growth rates of all species tested except P. mirabilis. However, when clinical strains of E. coli were transferred from urine with low osmolality to hyperosmotic urine, there was no slowing of the growth rate. There was no difference in growth rates of E. coli isolates from acute pyelonephritis, cystitis, and asymptomatic bacteriuria nor from fecal isolates. The ability to accumulate osmolytes, although it may be a factor in the adaptation to hypertonic environments, was not related to virulence.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and its susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents. Special references to bacteria isolated between July 1994 and June 1995].
AB  - Isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery during the period from July  1994 to June 1995 were investigated by a multicenter study in Japan, and the following results were obtained. One hundred and fifty-three strains were isolated from primary infections, and 143 strains were isolated from postoperative infections. From primary infections, both anaerobic Gram-positive and-negative bacteria were predominant, and from postoperative infections, aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant. Among aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Enterococcus faecalis was highest, followed by that of Staphylococcus aureus from both types of infections. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Streptococcus intermedius was highest from primary infections, but from postoperative infections anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria was uncommon. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in this order. From postoperative infections, P. aeruginosa was most predominantly isolated, followed by Serratia marcescens and E. coli. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of Bacteroides fragilis group was the highest from both types of infections. We have noticed that resistant strains against imipenem and ofloxacin were increasing among P. aeruginosa and resistant strains against cefazolin were increasing among E. coli. MICs of cefazolin against four out of 30 strains of E. coli were higher than 100 micrograms/ml, and MICs of imipenem was higher than 50 micrograms/ml against 5 out of 22 strains of P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Structure of the native cysteine-sulfenic acid redox center of enterococcal NADH  peroxidase refined at 2.8 A resolution.
AB  - In order to obtain the crystal structure of the flavoprotein NADH peroxidase with its native Cys42-sulfenic acid redox center, a strategy combining reduced exposure of crystals to ambient oxygen and data collection at -160 degrees C was applied. The structure of the native enzyme to 2.8 A resolution is described; these results conclusively establish the existence of the Cys42-sulfenic acid as the functional non-flavin redox center of the peroxidase and provide the first structure for any naturally occurring protein-sulfenic acid. The Cys42-sulfenic acid atoms C alpha-C beta-S gamma-O roughly define a planar arrangement which is stacked parallel to the si face of the FAD isoalloxazine and positions the sulfenyl oxygen atom only 3.3 A from FAD-C4A. His10-N epsilon 2 contributes a hydrogen bond to the sulfenic acid oxygen, at a distance of 3.2 A. Although one oxygen atom (OX1) of the non-native Cys42-sulfonic acid derivative identified in the earlier wild-type peroxidase structure was taken to represent the native Cys42-sulfenic acid oxygen [Stehle, T., Ahmed, S. A., Claiborne, A., & Schulz, G. E. (1991) J. Mol. Biol. 221, 1325-1344], this structure shows that the sulfenic acid oxygen does not occupy this position, nor is it hydrogen-bonded to Cys42-N as was OX1. Comparison of the native Cys42-sulfenic acid structure with that of two-electron reduced glutathione reductase provides an insight into the sulfenic acid FAD charge-transfer interaction observed with both wild-type and His10 mutant peroxidases. A model of the E.NADH intermediate recently observed in stopped-flow analyses of the enzyme [Crane, E. J., III, Parsonage, D., Poole, L. B., & Claiborne, A. (1995) Biochemistry 34, 14114-14124] has also been generated to assist in analyzing the chemical mechanism of sulfenic acid reduction.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of carbene complexes of rhodium(I) and ruthenium(II).
AB  - Twenty-four carbene-rhodium(I), carbene-ruthenium(II) complexes and related compounds were evaluated for their in vitro antimicrobial activity against the Gram-positive bacteria Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29212) and Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 29213) and Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), Pseudmonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853). The compounds 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 16, 18 and 19 were found very effective to inhibit the growth of Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus at the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 5, 25, 5, 50, 25, 24, 24, 24, 6.25and 12.5 micrograms/ml, respectively. The compounds 6, 10, 12, 14, 15 and 17 were significantly effective against Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus with MIC values of 100-200 micrograms/ml. The compounds 2, 6 and 11 were also significantly effective against Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa with MIC values of 200-400 micrograms/ml.
TI  - Serum antibodies to commensal oral and gut bacteria vary with age.
AB  - This study examined the relationship between serum antibody levels to selected bacteria from the commensal oral and gut flora with increased age in a healthy adult population. A total of 116 healthy subjects were studied consisting of the following age groups: 20-39 years (group A), 40-59 years (group B), 60-79 years (group C) and 80+ years (group D). Only significantly lower mean IgM antibody levels to Streptococcus mutans strain Guy's serotype c were observed in older age groups (P < 0.001). With Actinomyces viscosus NCTC 10951 significantly reduced IgM levels (P < 0.02) and significantly elevated IgA levels were observed with increased age (P < 0.05). IgA and IgG antibodies to Escherichia coli NCTC 10418 were increased significantly in the older age groups (P < 0.001), whilst a trend toward lower levels of IgM antibodies was recorded with age. No changes in IgA antibodies to Streptococcus faecalis NCTC 775 were observed but the lowest level of IgM antibodies were detected in the oldest age group (P < 0.05). Mean specific activity was decreased with age with IgM antibodies to the oral bacteria and increased with age with IgG and IgA antibodies to E. coli. Overall, our results suggest a general reduction in serum IgM antibody responses. This impairment in the circulatory IgM immune response may contribute to the increased occurrence of infections in the elderly.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo activities of LB10522, a new catecholic cephalosporin.
AB  - In vitro activity of LB10522 was compared with those of cefpirome, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, and cefoperazone against clinical isolates. Against gram-positive bacteria, LB10522 was most active among the compounds tested. It was fourfold more active than cefpirome against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis. LB10522 was highly effective against most members of the family Enterobacteriaceae tested. Ninety percent of isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis, and Salmonella spp. were inhibited at a concentration of < or = 0.5 micrograms/ml. These activities were comparable to those of cefpirome. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, LB10522 with a MIC at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited of 2 micrograms/ml was 16- and 32-fold more active than ceftazidime and ceftazidime against systemic infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus giorgio, Streptococcus pneumoniae III, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 1912E, Escherichia coli 851E, Proteus mirabilis 1315E, Serratia marcescens 1826E, and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus Ac-54. LB10522 was very resistant to hydrolysis by various beta-lactamases such as TEM-3, TEM-7, SHV-1, FEC-1, and P-99. LB10522 did not induce beta-lactamase in Enterobacter cloacae 1194E, although most of the reference cephalosporins acted as inducers of beta-lactamase in this strain. Time-kill study showed that LB10522, at concentrations of two or four times the MIC, had a rapid bactericidal activity against Staphylococcus aureus 6538p, Escherichia coli 851E, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa 1912E.
TI  - Proposed MIC quality control guidelines for National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards susceptibility tests using seven veterinary antimicrobial agents: ceftiofur, enrofloxacin, florfenicol, penicillin G-novobiocin, pirlimycin, premafloxacin, and spectinomycin.
AB  - The present multicenter study proposes broth microdilution quality control (QC) ranges for the antimicrobial agents ceftiofur, enrofloxacin, florfenicol, penicillin G-novobiocin, pirlimycin, premafloxacin, and spectinomycin, which are used in veterinary practice. Six separate laboratories tested replicates of National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS)-recommended QC organisms (Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213, and Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212) on medium lots both common and unique to all laboratories. The proposed ranges were within 3 or 4 log2 dilution steps of the modal MICs for all organism-antimicrobial agent pairs, depending on their MIC distributions. With > or = 94.7% of all MIC results being within the proposed QC ranges, all combinations tested comply with NCCLS guidelines and all have been accepted by the NCCLS subcommittee developing susceptibility testing procedures for veterinary laboratories.
TI  - Structure of the low-affinity penicillin-binding protein 5 PBP5fm in wild-type and highly penicillin-resistant strains of Enterococcus faecium.
AB  - Among its penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), Enterococcus faecium possesses a low-affinity PBP5, PBP5fm, which is the main target involved in beta-lactam resistance. A 7.7-kb EcoRI chromosomal fragment of E. faecium D63r containing the pbp5fm gene was cloned and sequenced. Two open reading frames (ORFs) were found. A 2,037-bp ORF encoded the deduced 73.8-kDa PBP5fm, the amino acid sequences of which were, respectively, 99.8, 78.5, and 62% homologous to those of the low-affinity plasmid-encoded PBP3r of Enterococcus hirae S185r and the chromosome-encoded PBP5 of E. hirae R40 and Enterococcus faecalis 56R. A second 597-bp ORF, designated psrfm, was found 2.3 kb upstream of pbp5fm. It appeared to be 285 bp shorter than and 74% homologous with the regulatory gene psr of E. hirae ATCC 9790. Different clinical isolates of E. faecium, for which a wide range of benzylpenicillin MICs were observed, showed that the increases in MICs were related to two mechanisms. For some strains of intermediate resistance (MICs of 16 to 64 micrograms/ml), the increased level of resistance could be explained by the presence of larger quantities of PBP5fm which had an affinity for benzylpenicillin (second-order rate constant of protein acylation [k+2/K] values of 17 to 25 M(-1) s(-1)) that remained unchanged. For the two most highly resistant strains, EFM-1 (MIC, 90 micrograms/ml) and H80721 (MIC, 512 micrograms/ml), the resistance was related to different amino acid substitutions yielding very-low-affinity PBP5fm variants (k+2/K < or = 1.5 M(-1) s(-1)) which were synthesized in small quantities. More specifically, it appeared, with a three-dimensional model of the C-terminal domain of PBP5fm, that the substitutions of Met-485, located in the third position after the conserved SDN triad, by Thr in EFM-1 and by Ala in H80721 were the most likely cause of the decreasing affinity of PBP5fm observed in these strains.
TI  - The gene encoding for penicillin-binding protein 5 of Enterococcus faecalis is useful for development of a species-specific DNA probe.
AB  - Recently, in Escherichia coli was cloned a Sau3AI 3.4-kb fragment containing the  gene encoding for penicillin-binding protein 5 (PBP5) of Enterococcus faecalis. The structural gene for the PBP of E. faecalis and the flanking regions were entirely sequenced (C. Signoretto, M. Boaretti, and P. Canepari, FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 123:99-106, 1994). When the entire cloned E. faecalis DNA insert, labeled with digoxigenin, was used as a probe to detect a homology gene in enterococci, it was observed that only DNAs of all the E. faecalis strains reacted to the probe. The same results were obtained when a HindIII fragment of 0.35 kb from the entire insert of 3.4 kb was used. In this study we tested a total of 62 clinically isolated enterococcal strains, belonging to the species E. faecalis (36 strains), E. faecium (13), E. gallinarum (6), E. bovis (2) E. avium (3), E. hirae (1), and E. casseliflavus (1). The results indicate that both the entire segment and the HindIII fragment may be useful for preparing a species-specific probe for rapid identification of E. faecalis species.
TI  - [Determination of serum aminoglycoside and vancomycin concentrations by the microbiological method in the presence of other antimicrobials].
AB  - The determination of serum concentrations of antimicrobials with a narrow therapeutic range by microbiological method requires some modifications when the patient is under combined antimicrobial therapy. The methodological conditions for the appraisal of aminoglycosides and vancomycin in the presence of other drugs were evaluated by using strains with selective sensitivity to the antimicrobial to be tested or by the adding crude extracts of beta-lactamases for the inactivation of the beta-lactam antimicrobials. These beta-lactamases were obtained from Enterobacter cloacae P99 (derepressed mutant) cultures for the inactivation of penicillins and first, second and third generation cephalosporins, as well as from Stenotrophomonas (Xanthomonas) maltophilia M 1484 cultures for the hydrolysis of imipenem. The strains allowing vancomycin appraisal and indifferent to the synergic activity of other drugs in the mixture were S. aureus M 2120, when the accompanying antimicrobials were gentamicin, ciprofloxacin or rifampicin, and E. faecalis M 2113, E. avium M 2091 and S. aureus M 2101 when the drugs in the mixture were amikacin, lincomycin or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, respectively. For the appraisal of gentamicin in the presence of vancomycin or fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin or norfloxacin), E. coli M 1376 was the most suitable strain, while the use of K. pneumoniae ATCC 10031 was required for the appraisal of amikacin or netilmicin. When rifampicin was the accompanying antimicrobial, E. coli M 1495 turned out more adequate. E. coli M 1462 proved to be more satisfactory for gentamicin, amikacin and netilmicin dosages in samples also containing chloramphenicol, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or tetracycline.
TI  - Intracellular survival of enteric bacteria in cultured human enterocytes.
AB  - Translocating enteric bacteria have been visualized within intact intestinal epithelial cells in animal models of bacterial translocation. Although the ability of the enterocyte to engulf bacteria has been well documented in both in vivo and in vitro experimental models, relatively little is known about the enterocyte's ability to degrade internalized bacteria. Intracellular survival of eight strains of enteric bacteria (two strains of Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella typhimurium, Proteus mirabilis, two strains of Escherichia coli, and two strains of Enterococcus faecalis) was quantified over a 20 h period using two different types of terminally differentiated polarized enterocytes considered relevant in vitro models of human small intestinal epithelium, namely Caco-2 and HT-29 cells. Caco-2 enterocytes were generally more permissive for bacterial uptake when compared with HT-29 enterocytes. However, bacterial survival was similar within each type of enterocyte, and most strains of enteric bacteria remained viable within enterocytes for the 20 h duration of the assay. In addition, with the exception of one strain of L. monocytogenes in Caco-2 cells, intracellular enteric bacteria had no noticeable effect on host enterocyte viability for this 20 h duration. Transmission electron microscopy was used to visualize both intact and degraded bacteria within individual enterocytes, suggesting that prolonged bacterial survival might have resulted from simultaneous bacterial degradation and replication. Thus, although enterocytes internalize enteric bacteria, enterocytes might not kill internalized bacteria as efficiently as leukocytes. Observations of bacterial intracellular survival supported the hypothesis that the enterocyte might be a portal of entry for translocating microbes, and observations of intracellular bacterial degradation might have implications for the role of the enterocyte as an antigen-presenting cell.
TI  - Novel method for assessing postantibiotic effect by using the Coulter counter.
AB  - To study postantibiotic effect, viable counts are routinely acquired by the pour  plate technique. However, this technique is laborious and time-consuming; the required sample dilutions also cause excessive errors and material wastage. A new total cell counting technique in which a Coulter counter is used to obtain more efficient postantibiotic effect measurements has been developed.
TI  - Douglas-fir root-associated microorganisms with inhibitory activity towards fungal plant pathogens and human bacterial pathogens.
AB  - A microbial culture collection composed of 1820 bacterial strains, including 298  actinomycete strains, was established from the roots of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) seedlings harvested from conifer nurseries and forest sites. Two hundred and thirty-four strains inhibited the growth of Fusarium, Cylindrocarpon, and (or) Pythium spp. in in vitro assays. A significantly greater proportion of bacterial strains from actinomycete genera exhibited antifungal properties compared with bacterial strains from nonactinomycete genera. Eighty-nine percent of identified inhibitory strains were Streptomyces, Streptoverticillium, Bacillus, Pseudomonas, or Burkholderia species. The actinomycete species were isolated almost exclusively from forest seedlings. Recovery of inhibitory strains representing 29 microbial species was enhanced using a variety of methods to isolate microorganisms from the roots of seedlings from nursery and forest sites. Bacterial strains (including actinomycete strains) with antifungal activity were tested for in vitro growth inhibition of six clinical human bacterial pathogens (Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Forty-eight percent of the tested strains inhibited one or more human pathogens, Inhibitory activity towards fungal and bacterial pathogens was strain specific, not species specific, and many inhibitory strains exhibited broad-spectrum activity. Strains with antifungal activity against several conifer root pathogens were also more likely to inhibit multiple species of clinical bacterial pathogens.
TI  - Electrotransformation of Clostridium thermosaccharolyticum.
AB  - Transformation of the thermophile Clostridium thermosaccharolyticum ATCC 31960 was achieved using plasmid pCTC1 and electroporation. Evidence supporting transformation was provided by Southern blots, detection of the plasmid in 10 out of 10 erythromycin-resistant clones, retransformation of E. coli and C. thermosaccharolyticum with plasmid DNA isolated from C. thermosaccharolyticum, and a proportional relationship between the number of transformants and the amount of DNA added. Transformation efficiencies were very low for plasmid DNA prepared from E. coli (0.6 transformants mg-1 DNA), although somewhat higher for plasmid DNA prepared from C. thermosaccharolyticum (52 transformants mg-1 DNA). Transformation-dependent erythromycin resistance indicates that an adenosine methylase gene originating from Enterococcus faecalis, a mesophile, is expressed in C. thermosaccharolyticum. The plasmid pCTC1 appears to be replicated independently of the chromosome, as indicated by visualization of recovered plasmid on gels, and retransformation using recovered plasmid. pCTC1 is maintained in C. thermosaccharolyticum at both 45 and 60 degrees C. Restriction analysis showed little or no rearrangement occurred upon passage through the thermophile.
TI  - Countertranscript-driven attenuation system of the pAM beta 1 repE gene.
AB  - The plasmid-encoded RepE protein is absolutely essential and rate-limiting for replication of the promiscuous plasmid pAM beta 1 originating from Enterococcus faecalis. We previously showed that the rep gene is transcribed from a promoter that is negatively regulated (approximately 10-fold reduction) by the CopF repressor. In this report, we show that this transcription is decreased a further approximately 10-times by a countertranscript-driven transcriptional attenuation system. Extensive mutagenesis revealed that this system operates by a mechanism similar to that previously described for the unrelated repC gene of plasmid pT181.
TI  - Azurocidin, a natural antibiotic from human neutrophils: expression, antimicrobial activity, and secretion.
AB  - The azurophil granules of human PMN contain four antibiotic proteins, the serprocidins, which have extensive homology to one another and to serine proteases. Azurocidin, a member of this family, is a 29-kDa glycoprotein with broad spectrum antimicrobial activity and chemotactic activity toward monocytes. Insect cells transfected with a baculovirus vector carrying azurocidin cDNA produced a recombinant azurocidin protein. We purified the recombinant azurocidin protein from the culture medium of the infected cells and showed that it retained the antimicrobial activity of the native neutrophil-derived molecule. In addition, we present evidence that a 49-amino-acid region of the recombinant azurocidin protein is required for its secretion from insect cells.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (1994). III. Secular changes in susceptibility].
AB  - Susceptibilities of Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Citrobacter spp., Enterobacter spp., Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia spp. isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 10 hospitals during June 1994 to May 1995 to various antimicrobial agents were compared with those in the same period of previous years according to a classification, uncomplicated UTIs, complicated UTIs without indwelling catheter, and complicated UTIs with indwelling catheter. No remarkable changes were found in susceptibilities of Citrobacter spp., Enterobacter spp. and Serratia spp. The susceptibilities of E. faecalis to amikacin and quinolones were better than those in 1993. As for S. aureus, susceptible strains to all drugs increased in uncomplicated UTIs. Against E. coli in 1993, the antimicrobial activities of piperacillin, cefotiam and aminoglycosides have decreased, however, in 1994, these activities have turned to the better state. As for Klebsiella spp. susceptible strains to ABPC decreased. The susceptibilities of P. mirabilis to all drugs except minocycline were good. Against P. aeruginosa in 1993, the activities of aminoglycosides have decreased, but, in 1994, these activities have turned to the better state. These data should be considered in clinical treatment of various urinary tract infections.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Paliurus spina-christi Mill. (Christ's thorn).
AB  
TI  - Synergistic induction of tumor necrosis factor alpha by bacterial lipopolysaccharide and lipoteichoic acid in combination with polytetrafluoroethylene particles in a murine macrophage cell line RAW 264.7.
AB  - The induction of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) by polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) particles (5-50 microns) and by bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and lipoteichoic acid (LTA) was examined in RAW cell cultures. Twenty-four-hour culture supernatants from the treated and control cells were assayed for TNF-alpha using a mouse L929 cell cytotoxicity assay. Untreated RAW cells produced low levels of endogenous TNF-alpha in the culture supernatants. Addition of 0.5 ng to 1 microgram/ mL LPS or 1 ng to 1 microgram/ml LTA increased the TNF-alpha production by 7-3570-fold and 2-815-fold, respectively. Addition of 1-5 mg PTFE increased the TNF-alpha production by 6-17-fold over the untreated control cell levels. The cells exposed to PTFE and 0.5 ng/mL LPS or 5 ng/mL LTA produced TNF-alpha levels that were significantly higher than those produced by any inducer alone. Thus, both LTA, a Gram-positive bacterial cell wall component and LPS, a Gram-negative bacterial cell wall component, can induce TNF-alpha production, which is further enhanced by PTFE particles in RAW cells.
TI  - In vivo activities of U-100592 and U-100766, novel oxazolidinone antimicrobial agents, against experimental bacterial infections.
AB  - The Upjohn oxazolidinones, U-100592 and U-100766, are orally bioavailable synthetic antimicrobial agents with spectra of activity against antibiotic-susceptible and -resistant gram-positive pathogens. In several mouse models of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection, U-100592 and U-100766 yielded oral 50% effective doses (ED50) ranging from 1.9 to 8.0 mg/kg of body weight, which compared favorably with vancomycin subcutaneous ED50 values of 1.1 to 4.4 mg/kg. Similarly, both compounds were active versus a Staphylococcus epidermidis experimental systemic infection. U-100592 and U-100766 effectively cured an Enterococcus faecalis systemic infection, with ED50 values of 1.3 and 10.0 mg/kg, and versus a vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium infection in immunocompromised mice, both drugs effected cures at 12.5 and 24.0 mg/kg. Both compounds were exceptionally active in vivo against penicillin- and cephalosporin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, with ED50 values ranging from 1.2 to 11.7 mg/kg in systemic infection models. In soft tissue infection models with S. aureus and E. faecalis, both compounds exhibited acceptable curative activities in the range of 11.0 to 39.0 mg/kg. U-100766 was also very active versus the Bacteroides fragilis soft tissue infection model (ED50 = 46.3 mg/kg). In combination-therapy studies, both U-100592 and U-100766 were indifferent or additive in vivo against a monomicrobic S. aureus infection in combination with other antibiotics active against gram-positive bacteria and combined as readily as vancomycin with gentamicin in the treatment of a polymicrobic S. aureus-Escherichia coli infection. U-100592 and U-100766 are potent oxazolidinones active against antibiotic-susceptible and -resistant gram-positive pathogens in experimental systemic and soft tissue infections.
TI  - Effect of hypoxia on enterocyte endocytosis of enteric bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To clarify the effect of hypoxia on bacteria-enterocyte interactions.  DESIGN: Randomized. SETTING: Research laboratory. SUBJECTS: Enteric bacterial and cultured human intestinal epithelial cells, HT-29 cells. INTERVENTIONS: The effect of hypoxia on bacterial internalization and intracellular survival was studied, using enterocytes cultured for 21 days in either 20%, 10%, or 5% oxygen. The effect of bacterial growth conditions on bacterial internalization by enterocytes was studied, using bacterial cells in either the log phase or stationary phase of aerobic growth, and using bacterial cells in stationary phase, grown either under low oxygen conditions or under anaerobic conditions. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Individual strains of enteric bacteria were incubated with HT-29 cells for 1 hr. Numbers of internalized bacteria were subsequently quantified after enterocyte lysis. Bacterial growth conditions (anaerobic vs. aerobic and log-phase vs. stationary-phase bacterial cells) had no noticeable effect on the numbers of Salmonella typhimurium, Proteus mirabilis, and Escherichia coli internalized by enterocytes. Enterocytes cultivated in 20%, 10%, or 5% oxygen were >95% viable. Enterocytes cultivated in 20% oxygen were confluent, but those enterocytes cultivated in hypoxia were not confluent and were fewer in number compared with enterocytes cultivated in normoxia. Compared with enterocytes grown in normoxia, enterocytes cultivated in 5% and 10% oxygen internalized greater numbers of each of seven strains of enteric bacteria, including Listeria monocytogenes (two strains), Enterococcus faecalis (two strains), and P. mirabilis, E. coli (two strains), with statistically significant increases noted for five of these seven bacterial strains. Intracellular survival of L. monocytogenes and P. mirabilis was assayed. Both species survived intracellularly for 22 hrs, with no noticeable differences in the numbers of intracellular bacteria recovered from enterocytes cultivated in 20%, 10%, and 5% oxygen. CONCLUSION: These in vitro results suggest that augmented bacterial endocytosis by enterocytes might at least partially explain the increased frequency of bacterial translocation associated with tissue ischemia.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (1994). II. Background of patients].
AB  - Clinical background was investigated on 628 bacterial strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 10 hospitals during period from June, 1994 to May, 1995. 1. Distributions of sex, age and urinary tract infections Among over sixties males, the majority was taken by complicated urinary tract infections. Among females, the uncomplicated urinary tract infections was most frequent without a relation of age. As for over 40 females, the increase of complicated UTI was admitted. 2. Distribution of sex, age and pathogens isolated from UTIs In uncomplicated UTIs, Escherichia coli was most frequently isolated without a relation of age, and next Enterococcus faecalis and CNS. In complicated UTIs without indwelling catheter, E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and E. faecalis were isolated the most frequent. In complicated UTIs with indwelling catheter, P. aeruginosa was most frequently isolated, and next E. faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus. 3. Administration of antimicrobial agents and pathogens isolated from UTIs In uncomplicated UTIs, pathogens, after administration of antibiotics, isolated from patients have obviously decreased from 216 to 32 isolates. And also, pathogens of complicated UTIs without indwelling catheter, have decreased from 127 to 50 isolates. However, in complicated UTIs with indwelling catheter, pathogens after or before administration of antibiotics, were not revealed an obvious change. 4. Pathogens and UTIs with or without factor and operation In uncomplicated UTIs with or without factor and operation, E. coli was mainly detected. In complicated UTIs without indwelling catheter and with factor and operation E. faecalis was mainly detected, and next E. coli, S. aureus and P. aeruginosa. Without factor and operation, E. coli was mainly detected. In complicated UTIs with indwelling catheter and with factor and operation, P. aeruginosa, E. faecalis and S. aureus were mainly detected at 23.5%, 15.0%, 15.0%, respectively. Without factor and operation, Proteus spp. 22%, and next E. faecalis and P. aeruginosa 10% and 12%, were detected, respectively. The distribution of pathogens, in the case of Proteus spp. and P. aeruginosa has been obviously varied by the influence of factor and operation.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (1994). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The frequencies of isolation and susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents were investigated on 567 bacterial strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections in 10 hospitals during the period of June 1994 to May 1995. Of the above total bacterial isolates, Gram-positive bacteria accounted for 26.8% and a majority of them were Enterococcus faecalis. Gram-negative bacteria accounted for 73.2% and most of them were Escherichia coli. 1. Enterococcus faecalis. Ampicillin (ABPC) and imipenem (IPM) showed the highest activities against E. faecalis isolated from patients with urinary tract infections. The MIC90s of them were 1 microgram/ml. Vancomycin (VCM) was also active with the MIC90 of 2 micrograms/ml. Piperacillin (PIPC) and biapenem (BIPM) were also active with the MIC90s of 4 micrograms/ml and 8 micrograms/ml, respectively. The others were not so active with the MIC90s of 16 micrograms/ml or above. 2. Staphylococcus aureus including MRSA. VCM showed the highest activities against S. aureus isolated from patients with urinary tract infections. Its MIC90 was 1 microgram/ml against both S. aureus and MRSA.

MINO showed the strongest activity against S. epidermidis isolated from patients with urinary tract infections. Its MIC90 was 0.25 microgram/ml. ABK was also active with the MIC90 of 1 microgram/ml. Cephems were active with the MIC90s of 2 approximately 16 micrograms/ml, but penicillins and quinolones were not so active with the MIC90s and 64 approximately 128 micrograms/ml. 4. Citrobacter freundii. Gentamicin (GM) showed the highest activities against C. freundii isolated from patients with urinary tract infections. Its MIC90 was 1 microgram/ml. IPM was also active with the MIC90 of 2 micrograms/ml. Cefpirome (CPR) and cefozopran (CZOP) were also active with the MIC90s of 4 micrograms/ml and 8 micrograms/ml. The others were not so active with the MIC90s of 32 micrograms/ml or above. 5. Enterobacter cloacae. IPM showed the highest activities against E. cloacae. Its MIC90 was 0.5 microgram/ml. GM and amikacin (AMK), ciprofloxacin (CPFX) and tosulfloxacin (TFLX) were also active with the MIC90s of 4 micrograms/ml. Penicillins and cephems except latamoxef (LMOX), cefmenoxime (CMX), CPR and CZOP showed lower activities with the MIC90s of 256 micrograms/ml or above. 6. Escherichia coli. Most of antimicrobial agents were active against E. coli. CPR, CZOP, IPM, carumonam (CRMN), CPFX and TFLX showed the highest activities against E. coli. The MIC90s of them were 0.125 microgram/ml or below. Cefotiam (CTM), flomoxef (FMOX) CMX, ceftazidime (CAZ), and LMOX were also active with the MIC90s of 0.25 microgram/ml. Penicillins were not so active with the MIC90s of 128 micrograms/ml or above. 7. Klebsiella pneumoniae. CRMN showed the highest activities against K. pneumoniae.

Most of the agents were not so active against P. aeruginosa. IPM showed MIC90 of 8 micrograms/ml. The others were not so active with the MIC90s of 16 micrograms/ml or above. CPFX showed MIC50 of 0.5 microgram/ml.
TI  - An abietane diterpene and two phenolics from Salvia forskahlei.
AB  - From the roots of Salvia forskahlei a new diterpenoid, forskalinone, two new aromatic compounds, the octanol esters of cis- and trans-4-O-methyl-caffeic acid dimers, were isolated together with the known compounds stigmast-3-one, sitosterol and alpha-amyrin. The structures of the new and the known compounds were established by spectral data. The antimicrobial activity of forskalinone and the dimeric cinnamic acid esters was tested against standard bacterial strains and a yeast, namely Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633, Staphylococcus aureus 6538P, S. epidermidis ATCC 12228, Proteus mirabilis ATCC 14153, Escherichia coli ATCC 8739, Klebsiella pneumonia ATC 4352, Pseudomonus aeruginosa ATCC 9027, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, beta-haemolytic Streptococcus and Candida albicans ATCC 10231. Forskalinone showed moderate resistance against S. epidermidis (670 micrograms ml-1) and slight activity against E. faecalis (168 micrograms ml-1). trans-4-O-Methyl-caffeic acid dimer octanol ester was inactive while the cis isomer showed a slight activity against C. albicans (156 micrograms ml-1).
TI  - Bacteroides fragilis enterotoxin modulates epithelial permeability and bacterial  internalization by HT-29 enterocytes.
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis has been associated with  diarrheal disease, and the enterotoxin has a cytopathic effect on cultured HT-29 enterocytes. Experiments were designed to determine the effect of B. fragilis enterotoxin on bacteria-enterocyte interactions. METHODS: Confluent HT-29 enterocytes were incubated for 1 hour with B. fragilis enterotoxin, followed by 1 hour of incubation with pure cultures of enteric bacteria, namely, Salmonella typhimurium (two strains), Listeria monocytogenes (three strains), Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli (three strains), and Enterococcus faecalis. Enterocyte viability was assessed using vital dyes, epithelial permeability was measured using transepithelial electrical resistance, enterocyte morphology and bacteria-enterocyte interactions were visualized using light and electron microscopy, and bacterial internalization was assessed using a quantitative culture of lysed enterocytes. RESULTS: B. fragilis enterotoxin did not affect enterocyte viability but decreased transepithelial electrical resistance, and individual enterocytes pulled apart. Enterotoxin pretreatment decreased internalization of L. monocytogenes (P < 0.01) but increased (P < 0.01) internalization of the other strains of enteric bacteria. Augmented bacterial internalization was associated with preferential bacterial adherence on the exposed lateral surface of enterotoxin-treated enterocytes. CONCLUSIONS: B. fragilis enterotoxin was associated with HT-29 cell rounding and with augmented internalization of selected strains of enteric bacteria that were preferentially adherent on the exposed enterocyte lateral surface.
TI  - Relationship between stress response toward bile salts, acid and heat treatment in Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - Stress tolerance and cross-protection in Enterococcus faecalis ATCC19433 were examined after exposure to bile salts, acid or heat shock. Bile salts and heat adapted cells demonstrated induced homologous tolerance and cross-resistance. No cross-protection of heat adapted cells against acid stress is observed and pretreatment with bile salts even sensitized the cells to this challenge. Whole-cell protein extract analysis revealed that each treatment induced a battery of stress proteins. Some of these polypeptides are induced by more than one treatment. The greatest overlap is observed between bile salts and heat treatments. Eighteen stress proteins, including DnaK and GroEL, are common between these stresses.
TI  - [Multicenter study of isolated micro-organisms resistant to antimicrobials in 10  Portuguese hospitals in 1994].
AB  - In 1994, Microbiology Laboratories of ten Portuguese hospitals analysed isolated  microorganisms found in blood and urine samples and studied antimicrobial susceptibilities of the most frequent bacterial pathogens. From 63780 blood samples, the most frequent were Staphylococcus spp. and from 69189 urine samples significant numbers of Escherichia coli, Enterococcus spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida spp. were isolated. Escherichia coli strains (c.7000) revealed a low percentage of resistance to antibiotics with the exceptions of ampicillin (48%) and co-trimoxazol (25%). Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates (c.2000) revealed important resistance to ampicillin (98%), cephalotin (31%), co-trimoxazol (38%) and gentamicin (28%), while values for 3rd generation cephalosporins varied among hospitals, with several strains showing phenotype of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase. A great variation in resistance values of P. aeruginosa (c.4000) was found in relation to the antibiotics as well as to the hospitals. Resistance to methicillin in S. aureus (c.6000) was high, reaching an average of 47%, and it was even higher with S. epidermidis (c.3000) and S. haemolyticus (c.650). Only vancomycin was always active against these strains. In E. faecalis (c.2500) resistance was of 2% to ampicillin, 35% to gentamicin, 45% to streptomycin and 1% to vancomycin. E. faecium isolates (c.300) showed the most worrying results with 70% resistance to ampicillin, 42% to gentamicin, 59% to streptomycin and 9% (30 strains isolated in 5 hospitals) to vancomycin. Vancomycin resistant strains were also resistant to all other antibiotics.
TI  - [In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of sulopenem, a new penem antibiotic].
AB  - The in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of sulopenem, a new penem, were evaluated in comparison with imipenem (IPM), meropenem (MEPM), ceftazidime (CAZ) and flomoxef (FMOX). Sulopenem had broad and potent antibacterial spectra against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including Enterococcus faecalis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Enterobacter spp. and Citrobacter freundii. Sulopenem showed concentration-dependent bactericidal activities against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. Morphological observation using phase-contrast microscope revealed that sulopenem induced spherical cell formation with E. coli and K. pneumoniae at lower concentrations and bacteriolysis at higher concentrations. Therapeutic efficacies of sulopenem against systemic infections in mice were almost equal to those of imipenem against Streptococcus pneumoniae. While its therapeutic efficacies were superior to those of meropenem, ceftazidime and flomoxef against S. aureus and S. pneumoniae, they were inferior to those of imipenem/cilastatin against S. aureus, K. pneumoniae and A. calcoaceticus.
TI  - [In vitro antibacterial activity of a new parenteral penem, sulopenem].
AB  - Eighty percent minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC80) of sulopenem against clinically isolated 12 to 80 strains of each of different bacteria were as follows: methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA): 0.20 micrograms/ml, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA): 50 micrograms/ml, coagulase-negative staphylococci: 3.13 micrograms/ml, Streptococcus pyogenes: < or = 0.013 microgram/ml, Streptococcus pneumoniae: < or = 0.013 microgram/ml, beta-streptococci: 0.05 microgram/ml, Enterococcus faecalis: 12.5 micrograms/ml, Enterococcus faecium: > 100 micrograms/ml, Escherichia coli CS2(R+): 0.10 microgram/ml, Klebsiella pneumoniae: 0.05 microgram/ml, Proteus mirabilis: 0.10 microgram/ml, Proteus vulgaris: 0.20 microgram/ml, Morganella morganii: 0.39 micrograms/ml, Providencia rettgeri: 3.13 micrograms/ml, Citrobacter freundii: 0.20 microgram/ml, Enterobacter cloacae: 0.39 microgram/ml, Serratia marcescens: 1.56 micrograms/ml, Pseudomonas aeruginosa: 50 micrograms/ml, Pseudomonas cepacia: 3.13 micrograms/ml, Xanthomonas maltophilia: > 100 micrograms/ml, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus: 1.56 micrograms/ml, ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae: 0.39 microgram/ml and Bacteroides fragil is: 0.20 microgram/ml, respectively. Sulopenem possesses a stronger activity than flomoxef or cefuzonam against Gram-positive bacteria, the strongest activity among the antibiotics tested against Gram-negative bacteria except P. aeruginosa. Sulopenem has stronger affinities than imipenem to all fractions of PBPs of S. aureus, E. coli, P. vulgaris, S. marcescens, even of P. aeruginosa. Affinities of sulopenem to PBPs-1 and -3 of S. aureus, PBP-2 of E. coli were much stronger than those of imipenem (IPM). Sulopenem generally has small Ki values to all types of beta-lactamases and also has stronger permanent inactivation effect to Ia and IIb types of beta-lactamases than IPM. No synergistic bactericidal activity of sulopenem was apparent with serum complement. However, synergism of sulopenem with macrophages was prominent in bactericidal activity. The cells of E. coli were well phagocytosed and rapidly digested by cultured macrophages in the presence of a higher than 1/8 MIC of sulopenem. Moreover, sulopenem was more stable than imipenem against swine and human dehydropeptidase-Is. Sulopenem is one of the antibiotics that do not induce the appearance of subclones resistant to the drug.
TI  - [In vitro and in vivo activities of sulopenem compared with those of imipenem and cephalosporins].
AB  - The in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of sulopenem (CP-70,429),a new  parenteral penem antibiotic, were compared with those of imipenem (IPM), flomoxef, cefuzonam (CZON) and cefotaxime. Sulopenem possessed broad-spectrum activities against Gram-positive bacteria and Gram-negative bacteria. Antibacterial activities of sulopenem against methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae were equivalent to or somewhat superior to those of IPM. Against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, sulopenem was 4- to 260-fold more active than reference antibiotics with broad-spectra. In a killing kinetics study for Haemophilus influenzae, sulopenem showed a 99.9% decrease of viable cells after 8 hours at a concentration of 0.20 micrograms/ml. This effect was obtained at a concentration 8-fold lower than that of IPM. The protective effects of sulopenem in murine experimental systemic infections were superior to those of imipenem/cilastatin. In murine experimental mixed infection with Escherichia coli and Bacteroides fragilis, sulopenem had lower ED50, in other words stronger antimicrobial activities than IPM. The therapeutic effect of sulopenem are related well with its MIC value. In guinea pigs experimental lung infection with Klebsiella pneumoniae, sulopenem was more effective than CZON or cefotiam.
TI  - Bacterial adherence and biofilm formation on latex and silicone T-tubes in relation to bacterial contamination of bile.
AB  - BACKGROUND: T-tube-related bacteriobilia causes infectious complications and obstruction. To prevent these, the choice of T-tube material may be of importance. METHODS: Transected common bile ducts (CBDs) of 17 piglets were sutured over latex or silicone T-tubes, or without a T-tube. RESULTS: After 6 weeks bacteriobilia was found in all of 12 CBDs with and in 1 of 5 CBDs without a T-tube (p < 0.05). By scanning electron microscopy (SEM) four of five latex and none of five silicone T-tubes had bacterial biofilms (p < 0.05). All tubes remained patent. Segments of T-tubes were incubated with five different bacterial strains. Sonication and SEM showed that 0.1-1.1% of 10(7) colony-forming units of inoculum adhered to T-tubes. Two to six times more bacteria adhered to latex than to silicone (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Silicone offers better long-term patency than latex. Less infectious complications occur if T-tubes are omitted.
TI  - Ticarcillin/clavulanic acid: determination of minimal inhibitory concentrations against bacterial strains isolated from patients in intensive care units. Comparison with other agents.
AB  - A total of 303 bacterial strains isolated from bronchoaspirates of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients, collected through June and December 1993, were tested for susceptibility to ticarcillin/clavulanic acid, imipenem, amikacin, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin and piperacillin. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) for each antibiotic was determined according to the NCCLS, by means of serial dilution on microplates. The isolates, 80.8% of which were beta-lactamase producing strains, belonged to Pseudomonas aeruginosa (79 strains), Pseudomonas fluorescens (8 strains), Xanthomonas maltophila (25 strains), Escherichia coli (16 strains), Klebsiella-Enterobacter-Serratia (KES) (62 strains), Proteus spp. (15 strains), Acinetobacter spp. (22 strains), Moraxella spp. (15 strains), Bacteroides catarrhalis (8 strains), Haemophilus spp. (11 strains), Staphylococcus aureus (32 strains), Enterococcus faecalis (10 strains). The highest rate of susceptibility to ticarcillin/clavulanic acid (100%) was detected among E. faecalis (MIC 2-16 micrograms/ml), B. catarrhalis (MIC 1-4 micrograms/ml) and Haemophilus spp. (MIC 1-4 micrograms/ml). Among the non-fermenting microorganisms ticarcillin/-clavulanic acid showed good activity toward P. aeruginosa and P. fluorescens (86% and 75% respectively). It was also very active against X. maltophilia with a susceptibility of 96%. Susceptibility to the other antibiotics tested was within the range of 16% and 28%.
TI  - Protein adsorption and bacterial adhesion to biliary stent materials.
AB  - Four biliary stents inserted for relief of jaundice in patients with biliary obstruction due to carcinoma of pancreatic head were examined for the adsorption of biliary proteins and bacterial colonization. Fibronectin and vitronectin (S-protein) were found to be the two main proteins adsorbed on the inner surface of the stents. Biliary isolates included Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, and Candida albicans. In vitro studies were performed to clarify the kinetics of biliary protein and bacterial adhesion. Biliary drains of polytetrafluorethylene, polyethylene, polyurethane, and rubber were placed in a flow cell and perfused with human bile at 37% C for 24 hr. The materials were subjected to either detection of adsorbed biliary proteins or perfusion with 3 H-labeled E. coli cells (1 X 10 6 cfu/ml). The results show that the adsorbed biliary proteins were detectable on the surface of biliary stents and able to enhance bacterial adhesion to the surface in the first 24 hrs after the exposure of stent materials to bile, and that both the adsorption of biliary proteins and the adhesion of bacterial cells were material- and strain-dependent. Furthermore, there was a clear correlation between the amount of adsorbed fibronectin and the number of adherent bacteria. The results indicate that, in the clinical situation, biliary proteins may be adsorbed on the surface of inserted stents within a short time after insertion, and some of them may be used by bacterial cells as receptors for adhesion to the surface, and thus involved in the process of bacterial adhesion.
TI  - Phosphorylation-induced torsion-angle strain in the active center of HPr, detected by NMR and restrained molecular dynamics refinement.
AB  - The structure of the phosphorylated form of the histidine-containing phosphocarrier protein HPr from Escherichia coli has been solved by NMR and compared with that of unphosphorylated HPr. The structural changes that occur upon phosphorylation of His 15, monitored by changes in NOE patterns, 3JNHH alpha-coupling constants, and chemical shifts, are limited to the region around the phosphorylation site. The His15 backbone torsion angles become strained upon phosphorylation. The release of this strain during the phosphoryl-transfer to Enzyme II facilitates the transport of carbohydrates across the membrane. From an X-ray study of Streptococcus faecalis HPr (Jia Z, Vandonselaar M, Quail JW, Delbaere LTJ, 1993, Nature 361:94-97), it was proposed that the observed torsion-angle strain at residue 16 in unphosphorylated S. faecalis HPr has a role to play in the protein's phosphocarrier function. The model predicts that this strain is released upon phosphorylation. Our observations on E. coli HPr in solution, which shows strain only after phosphorylation, and the fact that all other HPrs studied thus far in their unphosphorylated forms show no strain either, led us to investigate the possibility that the crystal environment causes the strain in S. faecalis HPr. A 1-ns molecular dynamics simulation of S. faecalis HPr, under conditions that mimic the crystal environment, confirms the observations from the X-ray study, including the torsion-angle strain at residue 16. The strain disappeared, however, when S. faecalis HPr was simulated in a water environment, resulting in an active site configuration virtually the same as that observed in all other unphosphorylated HPrs. This indicates that the torsion-angle strain at Ala 16 in S. faecalis HPr is a result of crystal contacts or conditions and does not play a role in the phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence and analysis of pWC1, a pC194-type rolling circle replicon in Lactococcus lactis.
AB  - A 2.8-kb cryptic plasmid showing no homology to either pFX3 (rolling circle, pE194-type) or pCI305 (theta-type) lactococcal replicons was identified in Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris 2204. The plasmid, pWC1, was compatible with both pCI3340 (a pCI305 derivative) and pFX3 in L. lactis subsp. cremoris 2204. Sequence analysis of pWC1 showed one major ORF encoding a protein with a deduced size of 316 amino acids (aa). Database comparisons showed that the protein was distinct from the pFX- and pCI-type replication proteins (less than 21% aa identity), but shared significant homology (up to 57% aa identity) with the replication proteins from a different group of rolling circle plasmids (pC194-type) commonly found in gram-positive bacteria. A pC194-type rolling circle plasmid has not been previously described in L. lactis. Further sequence analysis showed a conserved double-stranded origin of replication in pWC1 preceded by a large (118-bp) direct repeat. The chloramphenicol-resistance gene from pC194 was inserted into a nonessential region of pWC1 to give pCP12. The host range of pCP12 included Streptococcus thermophilus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus aureus, but not Escherichia coli. Both pCP12 and to a lesser extent pWC1 generated single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) in L. lactis. A possible single-stranded origin of replication was identified by sequence analysis of pWC1 and by comparing levels of ssDNA produced by pCP12 deletion derivatives. The pWC1 replicon may be a useful addition to other replicons currently available for vector construction.
TI  - Helicobacter pylori and gastric acid: biological and therapeutic implications.
AB  - Helicobacter pylori is highly adapted to its unusual ecological niche in the human stomach. Urease activity permits H. pylori survival at a pH of <4 in vitro and is required for the organism to colonize in animal models. However, urease does not play an important role in the survival of the organism in a pH range between 4 and 7. Other mechanisms of pH homeostasis remain poorly understood, but preliminary studies indicate that novel proteins are produced when H.pylori cells are shifted from pH 7 to 3, and the gene encoding a P-type adenosine triphosphatase that may catalyze NH4+/H+ exchange across the cytoplasmic membrane has been cloned. Mechanisms of pH homeostasis in other enteric bacteria are reviewed and provide insight into additional pathways that may be used by H. pylori. An important adaptation of H. pylori to the gastric environment may be its ability to alter gastric acid secretion. Acute infection is associated with transient hypochlorhydria, whereas chronic infection is associated with hypergastrinemia and decreased somatostatin levels. Thus, the survival of H. pylori in the gastric environment may be attributed to both the development of specialized intrinsic defenses and the organism's ability to induce physiological alterations in the host environment.
TI  - Comparison of ion plasma, vaporized hydrogen peroxide, and 100% ethylene oxide sterilizers to the 12/88 ethylene oxide gas sterilizer.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The performance of a standard gas sterilizer, which uses a mixture of  12% ethylene oxide (EtO) and 88% chlorofluorocarbon as the sterilizing gas (12/88), was compared to selected gas, ion plasma, and vaporized hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) sterilizers that do not use chlorofluorocarbons. The effect of serum and salt on sterilizer performance was evaluated. DESIGN: Test carriers (porcelain and stainless steel penicylinders, or 125-cm lengths of plastic tubing [internal diameter of 3.2 mm]) were inoculated with Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Mycobacterium chelonei, Bacillus stearothermophilus spores, Bacillus subtilis spores, and Bacillus circulans spores and then subjected to sterilization using 12/88, 100% EtO, ion plasma, or vaporized H2O2. The bacterial inoculum was prepared with and without 10% serum and 0.65% salt, and the residual bacterial load after sterilization as determined using viable counts. RESULTS: All of the sterilizers tested effected a six-log10 reduction of the bacterial inoculum on penicylinders, unless 10% serum and 0.65% salt were present, in which case the 100% EtO, vaporized H2O2, and ion plasma sterilizers were not as effective as the 12/88 sterilizer. None of the sterilizers could eradicate 10(6) CFU of all of the bacteria in 10% serum and 0.65% salt when inoculated inside a narrow lumen. CONCLUSIONS: The margin of safety for the 100% EtO, vaporized H2O2, and ion plasma sterilizers is less than that of the 12/88 sterilizer. The inability of all sterilizers, including the 12/88, to kill organisms in narrow lumens reliably when serum and salt were present raises concern about the current practice of gas sterilization of flexible endoscopes.

TI  - [Phenotypic differences of nosocomial bacterial strains isolated in the obstetric-gynecology service of the University Hospital Center of Dakar].
AB  - A study on nosocomial infections was conducted in the Laboratory of Bacteriology-Virology of Aristide Le Dantec's Hospital, in collaboration with the Gynecology Obstetrics clinic located both in the same Dakar's hospital, during May 1995. The aim of the study was to define the phenotypical characteristics of various bacterial strains isolated from the atmosphere health care staff's hands, medical equipment (material, antiseptics) and patients (hospitalized pregnant and newborns in day Nursery). A total of 133 strains were collected and the most frequent isolates were Staphylococcus aureus (27 strains) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (10 strains) encountered mainly in the atmosphere. Otherwise, Escherichia coli (11 strains) and Enterococcus faecalis (11 strains) were more present in hospitalized patients. Results obtained after antimicrobial agents susceptibility (Antibiotics and Heavy metal salts) by Antibiogramm and Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) and also data from biotyping of Klebsiella strains have allowed us to say there's a probable contamination of hospitalized patients by the bacteria from the atmosphere but manuportage too.
TI  - Molecular analysis of the rpoD gene of Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - The complete nucleotide sequence of the rpoD gene of Enterococcus faecalis ATCC19433 has been determined. This gene encodes a putative 368 amino acids (aa) polypeptide of a predicted Mr of 41842 named sigma 42. Upstream of the rpoD gene and beginning from the end of the cloned chromosomal fragment is an open reading frame encoding a putative 264-aa polypeptide. It is reminiscent of the C-terminal domain of known DNA primase from Gram-positive bacteria indicating that the E. faecalis rpoD gene is included in a macromolecular synthesis (MMS) operon, as it was described for Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis and Lactococcus lactis rpoD gene.
TI  - Molecular cloning and sequence analysis of the gene encoding the H2O-forming NADH oxidase from Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - To discover the molecular properties of two distinct NADH oxidases, corresponding to H2O2-forming oxidase (NOX-1) and H2O-forming oxidase (NOX-2) induced in Streptococcus mutans, for the first step we had cloned and sequenced the nox-1 gene encoding NOX-1. In this paper, a nox-2 gene encoding NOX-2 from S. mutans was cloned, and the nucleotides sequenced. The nox-2 gene comprises 1371 base-pairs, encoding a polypeptide of 457 amino acid residues. The deduced relative molecular mass (M(r) = 49919) agreed with the previous value obtained from the purified NOX-2 protein. The nox-2 gene was expressed in Escherichia coli using its own promoter. Alignment of the NOX-2 protein sequence with that of the NOX-1 showed that the proteins do not significantly resemble each other. Comparisons with the NADH oxidase from Streptococcus faecalis 10C1 yield identities of 41%. The redox-active cysteine in the enzyme from S. faecalis was found to correspond to Cys 44 in the NOX-2.
TI  - Bacteriological epidemiology and treatment of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - One hundred symptomatic women with clinical bacterial vaginosis (BV) were enrolled in this study. The bacteriological epidemiology of BV and efficacy of oral or vaginal administration of antimicrobial agents for treatment of BV were investigated. The epidemiology of BV was investigated before antimicrobial therapy. Fifty patients were treated with oral administration of metronidazole (MTN), 500 mg twice a day, and 50 patients with 2% clindamycin (CLDM) phosphate in a vaginal cream, 5 g once a day for 7 days. The major organisms occurring were Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Gardnerella vaginalis, Peptostreptococcus species, Bacteroides species, Prevotella species, and Mobiluncus species and opportunistic pathogens such as Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis. The therapeutic efficacy of CLDM cream on BV appeared to be preferable to oral MTN from clinical and bacteriological aspects. The clinical and bacteriological effectiveness of MTN and CLDM in the treatment of BV suggests that anaerobes might play a major role in causing the clinical symptoms in patients with BV.
TI  - Positive selection, cloning vectors for gram-positive bacteria based on a restriction endonuclease cassette.
AB  - Lactococcus lactis contains numerous restriction and modification (R/M) systems of different specificities. A novel IIS type R/M system encoded by the LlaI operon has previously been characterized from the L. lactis conjugative plasmid pTR2030. The LlaI operon is composed of six genes: First, a small regulatory gene llaIC precedes the methylase gene llaIM. The following three genes, llaI.1, llaI.2, llaI.3, are all essential for restriction endonuclease activity and are designed as the restriction cassette llaIR. The forth open reading frame of unknown function follows the llaIR gene cassette. We have successfully subcloned the three llaIR genes, llaI.1, llaI.2, and llaI.3, without llaIM, as a suicide cassette into the three shuttle vectors pTRKL2, pTRKH2, and pBV5030. A promoter (P6) from Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC4356, which is functional in E. coli, lactococci, and lactobacilli (Djordjevic and Topisirovic, unpublished) was cloned upstream of the three gene cassette. Restriction activity was evaluated in Escherichia coli and several gram-positive bacteria. The llaIR restriction cassette was not functional in E. coli, but its presence was lethal to L. lactis, Lactobacillus gasseri, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus johnsonii, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Carnobacterium pisicola, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis, and Leuconostoc gelidum. Several novel, positive selection cloning vectors were developed that can exploit unique cloning sites within the llaIR cassette. Insertions in llaI.1 resulted in complete inactivation of restriction activity and provided unconditional selection for recombinant plasmids in surviving transformants. These positive selection cloning vectors are the first for gram-positive bacteria that are based on a restriction endonuclease cassette. Functional activity of the llaIR genes in various gram-positive bacteria would also enable use of these cloning vectors for positive selection of promoters, terminators, and regulatory sequences across these genera.
TI  - A one-year survey of respiratory and urinary pathogens and their antimicrobial susceptibility.
AB  - A one-year (1993) survey of the distribution of pathogens causing respiratory and urinary infections and their antimicrobial susceptibility was performed. The most common bacteria isolated from the lower respiratory tract of patients in a district general hospital were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (35.9%) and Staphylococcus aureus (21.4%). About half of the Pseudomonas strains revealed a resistance to imipenem and gentamicin, whereas almost all Staphylococcus strains were resistant to penicillin G. The most common isolates from urine of in and out-patients were Escherichia coli (32.3% and 39.8%) and Enterococcus faecalis (16.6% and 14.2%). Escherichia coli strains were largely susceptible to almost all chemoantibiotics tested, whereas Enterococcus faecalis demonstrated a high resistance pattern. Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from urine were more sensitive to chemoantibiotics than respiratory strains and the susceptibility of Staphylococcus aureus isolated from hospitalized or out-patients was different. A periodic monitoring system devised to give information about the circulation of bacteria and the chemoantibiotic resistance in a local context would be useful to assess the local trends and select drugs for therapy.
TI  - Omeprazole inhibits growth of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria including  Helicobacter pylori in vitro.
AB  - The antibacterial effects of omeprazole (100, 200 and 300 mg/L) were assessed using bacterial growth curves. A dose-related permanent inhibition was seen with actively growing Gram-positive cocci. A reduced and only temporary effect was observed with Gram-negative bacilli. After 1 day the bacterial count of Helicobacter pylori in the presence of omeprazole 200 mg/L was reduced from 10(4) cfu/mL for the control to zero. No synergic or antagonistic interaction of omeprazole with amoxycillin or doxycycline was observed for Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity and biocompatibility of polyurethane and silicone catheters containing low concentrations of silver: a new perspective in prevention of polymer-associated foreign-body-infections.
AB  - In modern medicine, infection is one of the most serious complications of implanted plastic devices. The host is not able to overcome this special type of opportunistic infection despite having a normal immune response and a low virulence of most of the bacteria involved. Antimicrobial therapy alone generally cannot cure the infection and the removal of catheters often remains the only choice of therapy. Bacterial adhesion to the polymer surface of the catheter, be it luminal or external, is an important step in the pathogenesis of catheter-associated infections. In this report, we describe new approaches to the prevention of infections by impregnation of polyurethane and silicone with silver by two different methods. The antimicrobial activity of these silver-impregnated catheters is more than 10 fold higher for coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) compared to catheters without silver. Similar results are obtained with other microbial organisms like Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans. The new polymers show no cytotoxic or thrombogenic side effects in vitro.
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial activity of substituted benzimidazole, benzothiazole  and imidazole derivatives.
AB  - New benzimidazole, benzothiazole and imidazole derivatives were synthesized by reacting electron-rich olefins (5, 23 and 29) with appropriate reagents. The compounds synthesized were identified by 1H, 13C-NMR, FT-IR and mass spectroscopic techniques and micro analysis. All new and related compounds were evaluated for their in vitro antimicrobial activity against different bacteria. The compounds 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22 and 24 were found very effective to inhibit the growth of Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29212) and Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 29213) at minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 25, 25, 12.5, 50, 25, 50 and 50 micrograms/ml, respectively. The compounds 4, 10a, 10c, 16, 25, 26 and 31 were significantly effective against Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29212) and Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 29213) with MIC values of 100-200 micrograms/ml. None of the compounds proved to be effective against Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853) in the concentrations studied.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from urinary tract infections (1993). III. Secular changes in susceptibility].
AB  - Susceptibilities of Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Citrobacter spp., Enterobacter spp., Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia spp. isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 10 hospitals during June 1993 to May 1994 to various antimicrobial agents were compared with those in the same period of previous years according to a classification, uncomplicated UTIs, complicated UTIs without indwelling catheter, and complicated UTIs with indwelling catheter. The susceptibilities of E. faecalis to chloramphenicol decreased. As for S. aureus, susceptible strains to minocycline (MINO) decreased in complicated UTIs. As for Citrobacter spp., and Enterobacter spp., their susceptibilities were not observed an obvious change. Against E. coli, the activities of cefotiam decreased in complicated UTIs, and aminoglycosides decreased. As for Klebsiella spp., susceptible strains to aminoglycosides decreased. The susceptibilities of P. mirabilis to all drugs except aminoglycosides and MINO were good. The susceptibilities of P. aeruginosa to quinolones isolated from complicated UTIs with indwelling catheter increased, but susceptible strains to aminoglycosides decreased. The susceptibilities of Serratia spp. to MINO has decreased. These data should be considered in clinical treatment of various urinary tract infections.
TI  - Structure-activity relationship of new 2-substituted penem antibiotics.
AB  - The antibacterial activities of three new penems with 4-hydroxyprolinamide, 1-prolinamide and N-methyl-N-2-propionamide substituents, respectively, in position 2 and of their stereoisomers were examined against Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. All substitutes conferred a broad antibacterial spectrum on the penem moiety. Changes in stereoisomerism selectively improved the activity against E. coli, S. aureus or enterococci. The structure-activity relationships of each compound were discussed in relation to minimum inhibitory concentrations, penicillin-binding protein (PBP) affinity and outer membrane permeability coefficient in E. coli. In this microorganism, PBP 2 was the target for all compounds. Changes in stereoisomerism influenced the affinity for PBPs 1A/B and 2.

TI  - Generation of auxotrophic mutants of Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - A 22-kb segment of chromosomal DNA from Enterococcus faecalis OG1RF containing the pyrimidine biosynthesis genes pyrC and pyrD was previously detected as complementing Escherichia coli pyrC and pyrD mutations. In the present study, it was found that the E. faecalis pyrimidine biosynthetic genes in this clone (designated pKV48) are part of a larger cluster resembling that seen in Bacillus spp. Transposon insertions were isolated at a number of sites throughout the cluster and resulted in loss of the ability to complement E. coli auxotrophs. The DNA sequences of the entire pyrD gene of E. faecalis and selected parts of the rest of the cluster were determined, and computer analyses found these to be similar to genes from Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus caldolyticus pyrimidine biosynthesis operons. Five of the transposon insertions were introduced back into the E. faecalis chromosome, and all except insertions in pyrD resulted in pyrimidine auxotrophy. The prototrophy of pyrD knockouts was observed for two different insertions and suggests that E. faecalis is similar to Lactococcus lactis, which has been shown to possess two pyrD genes. A similar analysis was performed with the purL gene from E. faecalis, contained in another cosmid clone, and purine auxotrophs were isolated. In addition, a pool of random transposon insertions in pKV48, isolated in E. coli, was introduced into the E. faecalis chromosome en masse, and an auxotroph was obtained. These results demonstrate a new methodology for constructing defined knockout mutations in E. faecalis.
TI  - [Pathogenic bacteria isolated from the sputum of the patients with pulmonary emphysema].
AB  - Isolated pathogenic bacteria from sputum of the patients with pulmonary emphysema who were admitted in our hospital from 1984 to 1994 were examined to elucidate the relationship between isolated bacteria from sputum and pulmonary functions including vital capacity (VC), forced expiratory volume (FEV1.0), PaO2 and PaCO2. VC of the patients from whom MSSA (methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus) or Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis) were isolated was significantly lower than that of the patients from whom Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae), Branhamella catarrhalis (B. catarrhalis) or Haemophilus influenza (H. influenza) were isolated. FEV1.0 had a similar tendency as VC in terms of isolated organisms from the patients with emphysema. Similarly, PO2 of the patients from whom MSSA or E. cloacae were isolated was significantly lower than that of the patients from whom S. pneumoniae, B. catarrhalis or H. influenzae were isolated, and PCO2 of the patients from whom S. pneumoniae, B. catarrhalis or H. influenza were isolated. There was also impaired respiratory function in the patients from whom MSSA, Escherichia coli (E. coli), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa), Xanthomonas maltophilia (X. maltophilia) or Enterobacter cloacae (E. cloacae) were isolated, compared with those in the patients from whom S. pneumonia, B. catarrhalis or H. influenzae were isolated. These results suggest that isolated pathogenic bacteria are shifted from S. pneumoniae, B. catarrhalis or H. influenza to MSSA, E. coli, P. aeruginosa, X. maltophilia or E. cloacae in the course of impairment of respiratory function in pulmonary emphysema. The treatment and prophylaxis for acute exacerbation in pulmonary emphysema should be based on these results.
TI  - Nature and outcome of febrile episodes in patients with pancreatic and hepatobiliary cancer.
AB  - Fifty febrile episodes in patients with hepatobiliary and pancreatic cancer were  reviewed. Biliary obstruction often resulting in cholangitis was an important predisposing factor, whereas neutropenia (< 500 PMN/mm3) was uncommon (10%). Microbiologically documented infections originating from the gastrointestinal tract were predominant, with Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli being isolated most often. Non-infectious causes of fever occurred in 16% of patients. Only one patient developed a fungal infection. The overall response rate to therapy was 94%, with 32% being eligible for outpatient management. These data are quite different from those generated from patients with hematologic malignancies and indicate that disease-site specific management guidelines need to be developed for febrile episodes in patients with various underlying neoplasms.

TI  - A functional origin of transfer (oriT) on the conjugative transposon Tn916.
AB  - The origin of transfer (oriT) of the 18-kb conjugative transposon Tn916 has been  localized to a 466-bp region which spans nucleotides 15215 to 15681 on the transposon map. The oriT lies within an intercistronic region between open reading frames ORF20 and ORF21 that contains six sets of inverted repeats ranging from 10 to 20 bp in size. The segment contains three sequences showing identity in 9 of 12 bp to the consensus nicking site (nic) of the IncP family of conjugative plasmids found in gram-negative bacteria. Overlapping one of these sequences is a region similar to the nic site of the F plasmid. Functionality was based on the ability of the oriT-containing sequence to provide a cis-acting mobilization of chimeras involving the shuttle vector pWM401 in response to activation in trans by an intact chromosome-borne transposon Tn916 delta E. Cloned segments of 466 or 376 nucleotides resulted in unselected cotransfer of the plasmid at levels of about 40% when selection was for Tn916 delta E, whereas a 110-bp segment resulted in cotransfer at a frequency of about 7%. Mobilization was specific in that gram-positive plasmids, such as pAD1 and pAM beta 1, and the gram-negative plasmids pOX38 (a derivative of F) and RP1 did not mobilize oriT-containing chimeras.
TI  - 2-Substituted penems with amino acid-related side chains: synthesis and antibacterial activity of a new series of beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  - A new series of 6-(hydroxyethyl)penems 2-substituted with amino acid-related side chains was synthesized. The nature of the amino acyl derivative proved to be crucial both from a synthetic point of view, as beta-lactam ring opening can compete with C-2 nucleophilic substitution, and for antibacterial activity. Primary amino acid amides emerged as the most suitable side chains for enhancing permeability through a Gram-negative outer membrane. In vitro activity of the new 2-[(aminoamido)methyl]penems 3a-u was influenced by the nature and position of the amide moiety, the ring size for cyclic amides, and the configuration of the amino acid. Compounds bearing amides derived from small N-methyl amino acids (such as 3a) or from cyclic amino acids (such as prolinamide 3p and 4-hydroxyprolinamide 3r) showed broad spectrum in vitro activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative microorganisms.
TI  - pAM beta 1 resolvase has an atypical recombination site and requires a histone-like protein HU.
AB  - The broad-host-range plasmid pAM beta 1 from Gram-positive bacteria encodes a resolvase, designated Res beta, which shares homology with the proteins of the resolvase-invertase family. Here we report the purification and in vitro characterization of Res beta. This resolvase is particular in two aspects: it has an atypical binding site and requires a cofactor to promote resolution in vitro. Res beta binds to two regions within its resolution site res. One contains two inverted repeats (R1 and R2), the other contains only one repeat (R3). The cofactor required for resolution in vitro is present in crude extracts of both Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli and can be substituted by the E. coli histone-like protein HU. The possible mode of action of HU in the resolution process is discussed.

TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial activities of optically active substituted 1,2-dihydro-6-oxo-6H-pyrrolo[3,2,1-ij]quinoline-5-carboxylic acids.
AB  - A series of optically active substituted 1,2-dihydro-6-oxo-pyrrolo[3,2,1-ij]quinoline-5-carboxylic acids was prepared via optically active 2-methyl-4,5-difluoroindoline (10) and tested for antibacterial activities. Among them, (2S)-9-[(3R,1'S)-3-(1'-amino)ethyl-1-pyrrolidinyl]-8-fluoro-1,2-dihydro- 2- methyl-6-oxo-6H-pyrrolo[3,2,1-ij]-quinoline-5-carboxylic acid (19) showed potent activity against gram-positive bacteria and (2S)-8-fluoro-1,2-dihydro-2-methyl-9-(3-methyl-1-piperazinyl)-6-oxo-6H- pyrrolo[3,2,1-ij]quinoline-5-carboxylic acid (16) exhibited well balanced in vitro activity, good intravenous efficacy, and high aqueous solubility.
TI  - Cloning and characterization of a region of Enterococcus faecalis plasmid pPD1 encoding pheromone inhibitor (ipd), pheromone sensitivity (traC), and pheromone shutdown (traB) genes.
AB  - Bacteriocin plasmid pPD1 in Enterococcus faecalis encodes a mating response to recipient-produced sex pheromone cPD1. Once a recipient acquires pPD1, transconjugants apparently shut off cPD1 activity in broth culture and no longer behave as recipients for pPD1. This event is performed by synthesis of the pheromone inhibitor iPD1 and also by repression of cPD1 production, the so-called "pheromone shutdown." A 5.4-kb EcoRV-HincII segment of pPD1, which expressed iPD1 in Escherichia coli, was sequenced and found to be organized as traC-traB-traA-ipd; each open reading frame is analogous to that found in other pheromone plasmids, pAD1 and pCF10, and thus is designated in accordance with the nomenclature in pAD1. The ipd gene encodes a peptide consisting of 21 amino acids, in which the C-terminal eight residues correspond to iPD1. The putative TraC product has a strong similarity to oligopeptide-binding proteins found in other bacterial species, as do pheromone-binding proteins of pCF10 and pAD1. A strain carrying traC-disrupted pPD1 required a concentration of cPD1 fourfold higher than that needed by the wild-type strain for induction of sexual aggregation. These results suggest that the TraC product contributes to pheromone sensitivity as a pheromone-binding protein. A strain transformed with traB-disrupted pPD1 produced a high level of cPD1 similar to that produced by plasmid-free recipients and underwent self-induction. Thus, the TraB product contributes to cPD1 shutdown.
TI  - Exposure of the lateral enterocyte membrane by dissociation of calcium-dependent  junctional complex augments endocytosis of enteric bacteria.
AB  - Intestinal bacterial translocation is facilitated in a variety of clinical conditions involving increased intestinal permeability, such as shock and trauma. Because there is both in vivo and in vitro evidence that enteric bacteria can be internalized by intestinal epithelial cells, experiments were designed to test the effect of increased intestinal permeability on enterocyte endocytosis of enteric bacteria. Mature, confluent cultures of HT-29 enterocytes were placed in a calcium-free solution for 1 h. Enterocyte viability was not noticeably altered, but transepithelial electrical resistance was significantly decreased (indicating a decrease in epithelial junctional integrity), and the enterocytes were pulled apart. Electron microscopic observations revealed enteric bacteria preferentially adherent on the exposed enterocyte lateral surface, and the numbers of viable enteric bacteria (Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella typhimurium, Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, and Enterococcus faecalis) internalized by these enterocytes were significantly increased. Restoration of calcium restored confluency to enterocyte cultures, and bacterial internalization reverted to control levels. Thus, calcium-dependent junctional integrity might play a role in augmenting bacterial translocation in clinical conditions associated with increased intestinal permeability.
TI  - Nosocomial bacteremia-induced increases in abscess formation correlate with in vitro upregulation of macrophage procoagulant activity.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the hypothesis that sublethal exposure to common nosocomial pathogens can alter the host response to a later, distant infectious insult (peritonitis and intraperitoneal abscess formation), and that these changes are related to the induction of macrophage procoagulant activity. DESIGN: A multiexperiment, randomized, controlled trial. SETTING: Animal research laboratory of a university medical center. SUBJECTS: One hundred sixty-five Balb/c mice, weighing 20 to 25 g, were used for in vivo experiments and as the source of peritoneal macrophages for in vitro experiments. INTERVENTIONS: Nine groups of mice (n = 10 to 18 per group) were twice systemically preexposed to sublethal amounts of live Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, or Candida albicans, or to 2.5 or 5.0 micrograms E. coli lipopolysaccharide O26:B6. One week later, mice underwent the induction of mixed E. coli/Bacteroides fragilis peritonitis, leading to abscess formation. In parallel experiments in vitro, 10(6) mouse peritoneal macrophages were incubated with similar amounts of nosocomial pathogens or lipopolysaccharide to determine the induction of macrophage procoagulant activity. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The three Gram-negative bacilli tested significantly upregulated both abscess formation and macrophage procoagulant activity, with a strong linear correlation between abscess formation and procoagulant activity. These effects were not seen with the Gram-positive cocci or with C. albicans. Pre-exposure of mice to endotoxin alone did not alter later abscess formation, but did increase macrophage procoagulant activity. CONCLUSIONS: Sublethal exposure to some Gram-negative nosocomial pathogens can significantly alter a host's response to a later, distant, infection, even when caused by different bacteria. In the case of peritonitis and intraperitoneal abscess formation, these changes may be mediated by the upregulation of macrophage procoagulant activity. The presence of endotoxin alone does not completely explain these phenomena.
TI  - Strangulation of the colon complicating acute pancreatitis.
AB  - We report a patient with alcohol-induced necrotizing pancreatitis who developed a severe ileus followed by incarceration of a portion of the transverse colon within a ventral hernia. Laparotomy 9 days after the onset of symptoms revealed infarction of the transverse colon and infection of the pancreas. This is the first report of a case of acute pancreatitis that led to a strangulated ventral hernia of the colon. We believe that the enteric organisms that infected the pancreas originated in the incarcerated transverse colon.

TI  - Efficacy of ozonated water against various food-related microorganisms.
AB  - The antimicrobial effects of ozonated water in a recirculating concurrent reactor were evaluated against four gram-positive and four gram-negative bacteria, two yeasts, and spores of Aspergillus niger. More than 5 log units each of Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli cells were killed instantaneously in ozonated water with or without addition of 20 ppm of soluble starch (SS). In ozonated water, death rates among the gram-negative bacteria--S. typhimurium, E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Yersinia enterocolitica--were not significantly different (P > 0.05). Among gram-positive bacteria, Listeria monocytogenes was significantly P < 0.05) more sensitive than either Staphylococcus aureus or Enterococcus faecalis. In the presence of organic material, death rates of S. aureus compared with L. monocytogenes and E. coli compared with S. typhimurium in ozonated water were not significantly (P > 0.05) affected by SS addition but were significantly reduced (P < 0.05) by addition of 20 ppm of bovine serum albumin (BSA). More than 4.5 log units each of Candida albicans and Zygosaccharomyces bailii cells were killed instantaneously in ozonated water, whereas less than 1 log unit of Aspergillus niger spores was killed after a 5-min exposure. The average ozone output levels in the deionized water (0.188 mg/ml) or water with SS (0.198 mg/ml) did not differ significantly (P < 0.05) but were significantly lower in water containing BSA (0.149 mg/ml).
TI  - Controlled evaluation of BacT/alert standard anaerobic and FAN anaerobic blood culture bottles for the detection of bacteremia and fungemia.
AB  - FAN medium was formulated to improve microbial recovery, particularly for fastidious microorganisms and for microorganisms causing sepsis in patients receiving antimicrobial therapy. In a controlled clinical evaluation performed at four university-affiliated hospitals, FAN anaerobic bottles were compared with standard anaerobic bottles for yield, speed of detection of microbial growth, and detection of septic episodes. A total of 10,431 blood culture sets were received; both anaerobic bottles of 7,694 blood culture sets were adequately filled with blood. Altogether, 925 isolates were recovered: 557 that were the cause of sepsis, 99 that were indeterminate as the cause of sepsis, and 269 contaminants. More Staphylococcus aureus (P < 0.001), coagulase-negative staphylococci (P < 0.001), Escherichia coli (P < 0.02), and all microorganisms combined (P < 0.005) were recovered from FAN bottles; more nonfermentative gram-negative bacilli (P < 0.05), Torulopsis glabrata (P < 0.001), and other yeasts (P < 0.01) were recovered from standard bottles. Growth of S. aureus (P < 0.001), coagulase-negative staphylococci (P < 0.001), Enterococcus faecalis (P < 0.025), streptococci other than Streptococcus pneumoniae (P < 0.01), and all microorganisms combined (P < 0.001) was detected earlier in standard bottles; growth of more isolates of E. coli (P < 0.05) and anaerobic bacteria (P < 0.01) was detected earlier in FAN bottles. The mean times to detection were 14.2 and 16.1 h for standard and FAN bottles, respectively. More septic episodes caused by S. aureus (P < 0.001), coagulase-negative staphylococci (P < 0.005), members of the family Enterobacteriaceae (P < 0.02), and all microorganisms combined (P < 0.02) were detected in FAN bottles; more septic episodes caused by nonfermentative gram-negative bacilli (P < 0.025) and yeasts (P < 0.005) were detected in standard bottles. In summary, more isolates (except for strict aerobes) were recovered from FAN bottles than from standard anaerobic bottles. Similarly, significant more septic episodes (except for those caused by strict aerobes) were detected with FAN bottles than with standard anaerobic bottles. With the exception of E. coli and anaerobic bacteria, growth of more isolates was detected earlier in standard anaerobic bottles.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from urinary tract infections (1989). II. Background of patients].
AB  - Clinical background was investigated on 1,197 bacterial strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 10 hospitals during the period from June, 1989 to May, 1990. 1. Distribution of sex and age A majority of female patients with UTIs accounted for a twenties and thirties. The proportion of male patients with UTI has increased with age, accounting for majority in patients 70 years or older. 2. Distribution of infection types and age Most cases among twenties or thirties were uncomplicated UTIs. Fifties and older cases were most frequent in complicated UTIs. 3. Distribution of isolated bacteria and age Escherichia coli was most frequent on the whole, followed by Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus spp. and Klebsiella spp.. E. coli had declined with age, and on the other hand, E. faecalis and P. aeruginosa had increased with age. 4. Administration of antibiotics and pathogens isolated from UTIs. In uncomplicated UTIs, pathogens, after administration of antibiotics, isolated from patients have obviously decreased from 439 to 4. Before an administration of antibiotics, E. coli was mainly detected, but after an administration of antibiotics, E. coli has decreased into two strains. After administration of antibiotics, pathogens of complicated UTIs, without indwelling catheter, have decreased from 324 to 19: E. coli has decreased from 86 to 2, but E. faecalis, Staphylococcus spp., Enterobacter spp. and P. aeruginosa have increased. Pathogens of complicated UTIs with indwelling catheter, have decreased from 156 to 14 after administration of antibiotics, and mainly isolated pathogens were E. faecalis and P. aeruginosa.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from urinary tract infections (1989). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The frequencies of isolation and susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents were investigated on 1,032 bacterial strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections in 10 hospitals during the period of June 1989 to May 1990. Of the above total bacterial isolates, Gram-positive bacteria accounted for 30.8% and a majority of them were Enterococcus faecalis. Gram-negative bacteria accounted for 69.2% and most of them were Escherichia coli. 1. Enterococcus faecalis Imipenem (IPM) showed the highest activity against E. faecalis isolated from patients with urinary tract infections. The followings, ampicillin (ABPC) and vancomycin (VCM) showed potent activities, with the MIC90S of 2 micrograms/ml. Piperacillin (PIPC), minocycline (MINO) and chloramphenicol (CP) were also active with the MIC90S of 8 micrograms/ml. The others were not so active with the MIC90S of 32 micrograms/ml or above. 2. Staphylococcus aureus VCM showed the highest activity against S. aureus with MIC90 of 1 microgram/ml. Dicloxacillin (MDIPC) and arbekacin (ABK) were active with the MIC90S of 2 micrograms/ml. MINO showed the MIC90 of 4 micrograms/ml. All other agents except ciprofloxacin (CPFX) showed lower activity. 3. Staphylococcus epidermidis MINO showed the highest activity against S. epidermidis. Its MIC90 was 0.25 microgram/ml. The followings, ABK and VCM were also active with the MIC90S of 0.5 microgram/ml, 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. The others except CPFX were not so active. 4. Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) Most of the agents were active against CNS. IPM, ABK and MINO showed the highest activities with the MIC90S of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. MDIPC, cefazolin (CEZ), cefotiam (CTM) and VCM were also active with the MIC90S of 1 microgram/ml. Clindamycin (CLDM) showed lower activity, with the MIC90 of 128 micrograms/ml. 5. Streptococcus agalactiae CEZ, cefuzonam (CZON), IPM and CLDM showed the potent activity, all strains were inhibited at the MIC of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. The followings, cefmenoxime (CMX) and erythromycin (EM) were active with the MIC90S of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. PIPC and VCM were also active with the MIC90S 0.25 microgram/ml and 0.5 microgram/ml, respectively Amikacin (AMK) showed lower activity. Escherichia coli IPM, CTM, flomoxef (FMOX), CMX, carumonam (CRMN), norfloxacin (NFLX), ofloxacin (OFLX) and CPFX showed the highest activities against E. coli. The MIC90S of them were .125 microgram/ml or below. ceftazidime (CAZ) and CZON were also active with the MIC90S of 0.25 microgram/ml. Penicillins except mecillinam (MPC) were not so active showing the MIC90S of 32 micrograms/ml or above. 7. Klebsiella pneuminiae FMOX, CMX, cefixime (CFIX), IPM, CRMN and NFLX showed the highest activities against K. pneumoniae.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Structural evidence for the evolutionary divergence of mycoplasma from gram-positive bacteria: the histidine-containing phosphocarrier protein.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The three-dimensional structures of histidine-containing phosphocarrier protein (HPr), a member of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS), have been determined from Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. The structure of HPr reported here for Mycoplasma capricolum is the first protein structure to be determined for this class of organism. Comparative structural studies with the bacterial proteins highlight sequence-structure correlations relevant to proposals about the evolutionary origin of mycoplasmas. RESULTS: The crystal structure of HPr from M. capricolum has been determined and refined at 1.8 A resolution, revealing the same overall fold as that of other HPrs of known structure. However, mycoplasma HPr resembles HPrs from Gram-positive bacteria more closely than those from Gram-negative bacteria. As in HPrs from Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli, the phosphoryl group carrier (His15) forms the N-terminal cap of a helix, but in contrast to the other crystal structures, the side chain of the adjacent Arg17 is conformationally disordered. A sulfate ion interacts with Ser46, a residue known to be phosphorylated in a regulatory manner. CONCLUSIONS: The greater degree of structural similarity of the M. capricolum HPr to HPrs from Gram-positive rather than Gram-negative bacteria is consistent with the proposal that mycoplasma evolved from Gram-positive bacteria. The proposal that no major conformational transition is required for phosphorylation of the active-site histidine is reinforced by comparing the crystal structures with and without an anion in the active site. The conformational disorder of the Arg17 side chain suggests that its guanidinium group does not have to form specific interactions with other protein groups before phosphorylation at His15. The association of a sulfate ion with Ser46 serves as a model for HPr(Ser46-P). As there is no evidence of a conformational change accompanying Ser46 phosphorylation, the inhibitory effect of this event may be attributable to altered surface electrostatics.
TI  - Typing of sequential bacterial isolates by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis.
AB  - We typed 39 sets of multiple bacterial isolates of the same species from patients by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of genomic DNA (PFGE). Isolates were cultured from different sites or over a 2-week or longer interval. Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterobacter cloacae were tested. Excluding E. cloacae, 28 of 32 sets of isolates (87%) demonstrated only identical or highly related PFGE types. Four of the seven sets of E. cloacae showed different types. For species other than E. cloacae, our results suggest that patients are usually colonized and infected with a single strain of these bacterial pathogens. Unlike all of the other tested species, E. cloacae PFGE typing differences suggested the presence of multiple strains causing colonization and infection.
TI  - Streptococcal plasmid pIP501 has a functional oriT site.
AB  - DNA sequence analysis suggested the presence of a plasmid transfer origin-like site (oriT) in the gram-positive conjugative plasmid pIP501. To test the hypothesis that the putative oriT site in pIP501 played a role in conjugal transfer, we conducted plasmid mobilization studies in Enterococcus faecalis. Two fragments, 49 and 309 bp, which encompassed the oriT region of pIP501, were cloned into pDL277, a nonconjugative plasmid of gram-positive origin. These recombinant plasmids were mobilized by pVA1702, a derivative of pIP501, at a frequency of 10(-4) to 10(-5) transconjugants per donor cell, while pDL277 was mobilized at a frequency of 10(-8) transconjugants per donor cell. These results indicated that the oriT-like site was needed for conjugal mobilization. To demonstrate precise nicking at the oriT site, alkaline gel and DNA-sequencing analyses were performed. Alkaline gel electrophoresis results indicated a single-stranded DNA break in the predicted oriT site. The oriT site was found upstream of six open reading frames (orf1 to orf6), each of which plays a role in conjugal transfer. Taken together, our conjugal mobilization data and the in vivo oriT nicking seen in Escherichia coli argue compellingly for the role of specific, single-stranded cleavage in plasmid mobilization. Thus, plasmid mobilization promoted by pVA1702 (pIP501) works in a fashion similar to that known to occur widely in gram-negative bacteria.

TI  - Bactericidal activity of copper and noncopper paints.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To screen copper and noncopper paints for their bactericidal effectiveness in rendering surfaces self-disinfecting. DESIGN: Tested paints were applied to glass coverslips, cured, inoculated with test organisms (Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterococcus faecalis), and dried. After 0, 24, or 48 hours, surviving organisms were eluted and enumerated, and counts compared with those obtained from inoculated control (unpainted) coverslips for the corresponding time periods. Copper elution from select copper paints was quantified by complete immersion of coated coverslips followed by spectroscopic analysis to infer a threshold relationship between kill and copper release. RESULTS: Nearly all of the tested copper paints were capable of reducing organism counts to negligible levels within 24 hours. Exterior latex paints supplemented with a fungicide were similarly efficacious. Standard interior latex paint reduced bacterial counts to nearly zero within 24 hours for E coli and P aeruginosa, and to zero within 48 hours for E faecalis. However, substantial survival of S aureus occurred (up to 4 logs at 24 hours). Chi-squared analysis of elution and cidal data indicated that lethality was dependent on copper release in excess of 32 micrograms. CONCLUSION: The data support presumptive bactericidal claims for several copper and noncopper paints. Despite controversy over environment-based contagion, such paints could be used to render surfaces self-disinfecting in strategic locations where environmental causation of nosocomial infections is suspected.
TI  - Characterization and heterologous expression of the tetL gene and identification  of iso-ISS1 elements from Enterococcus faecalis plasmid pJH1.
AB  - The tetracycline-resistance (TcR) determinant of the Enterococcus faecalis plasmid pJH1 has been identified and located on a 2.2-kb RsaI-EcoRI fragment. The fragment was cloned in Escherichia coli, and specified TcR in this host. The nucleotide (nt) sequence of the cloned fragment showed the presence of an open reading frame (ORF) of 1374 bp, designated tetL. The nt sequence of tetL from pJH1 was identical to that of the tetL present on pLS1 from Streptococcus agalactiae. Upstream of the pJH1 tetL, part of another ORF was found that, except for two single-nt substitutions, was identical to an iso-ISS1 element from Lactococcus lactis. Hybridization studies indicated the presence of several ISS1-like elements in plasmid pJH1, but not on the En. faecalis chromosome. To study its usefulness as a marker in Gram+ organisms, the pJH1 tetL was cloned on the broad-host-range plasmid pNZ124, resulting in pNZ280, that was found to give resistance to 40 micrograms Tc/ml in Lc. lactis and Bacillus subtilis.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of the new 4-quinolones DU-6859a and DV-7751a.
AB  - The bactericidal activity of two new 4-quinolones, DU-6859a and DV-7751a, was investigated against strains of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Enterococcus faecalis. DU-6859a and DV-7751a were more bactericidal than any 4-quinolone tested previously. Furthermore, DU-6859a was unique among 4-quinolones in being able to kill Ent. faecalis after incubation for only 3 h in nutrient broth. The bactericidal mechanisms of DV-7551a were similar to those of other 4-quinolones, but, uniquely, DU-6859a possessed additional bactericidal mechanisms against both Str. pneumoniae and Ent. faecalis. This may explain the unusually potent bactericidal activity of this agent against these species. These results show that DU-6859a is a unique extended-spectrum 4-quinolone, which should prove to be superior to established 4-quinolones.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activities of FK037: a new parenteral cephalosporin.
AB  - The antibacterial and bactericidal activities and the stability of FK037 to beta-lactamases were investigated and compared with those of cefpirome, flomoxef, ceftazidime, ceftizoxime, and vancomycin. Against clinical isolates of methicillin-sensitive and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, FK037 was less active than vancomycin but more potent than the other drugs tested. Among highly methicillin-resistant staphylococci (MIC for methicillin: 200 mg/l or higher), none of the strains were highly resistant to FK037 (MIC > or = 100 mg/l) unlike the other cephalosporins. With the exception of Enterococcus faecalis, FK037 had an activity equipotent to that of cefpirome and far superior to those of flomoxef, ceftazidime and ceftizoxime against other gram-positive clinical isolates. The activity of FK037 against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas cepacia was equipotent to that of cefpirome but 2- to 4-fold less active than that of ceftazidime. FK037 inhibited 90% of Enterobacter cloacae and Citrobacter freundii growth at a concentration of 6.25 mg/l; it was as active as cefpirome and much more active than ceftazidime. Against the other gram-negative bacteria tested, FK037 was equipotent to cefpirome and ceftazidime and was more effective than flomoxef. FK037, like cefpirome, portrayed a high stability to various beta-lactamases except type II penicillinase and oxyimino-cephalosporinase (CXase). FK037 scored an MIC range of 0.013-6.25 mg/l against numerous beta-lactamase-producing bacterial strains with the exception of some CXase-producing strains and a cephalosporinase-producing C. freundii; and against strains other than P. aeruginosa FK037 was as active as cefpirome and 2- to 32-fold more active than ceftazidime. FK037 displayed highly potent activities against cephalosporinase-producing E. cloacae, C. freundii and Serratia marcescens which were resistant to flomoxef and ceftizoxime. FK037 was highly bactericidal against S. aureus and Escherichia coli at its MIC or higher.
TI  - A randomised comparison of isepamicin and amikacin in the treatment of bacterial  infections in paediatric patients.
AB  - The efficacy and safety of isepamicin 7.5 mg/kg of body weight twice daily or amikacin the same dosage regimen for the treatment of various infections in neutropenic and non-neutropenic paediatric patients were compared in a prospective randomised trial. In total, 306 patients were enrolled and received at least one dose of randomised treatment (204 isepamicin, 102 amikacin: intent-to-treat population); 181 patients satisfied all criteria for evaluability (120 isepamicin, 61 amikacin: efficacy population). Clinical cure or improvement rates in the isepamicin and amikacin groups were: intent-to-treat population, 188/204 (92%) and 94/102 (92%), respectively; efficacy population, 117/120 (98%) and 58/61 (95%), respectively. The bacteriological elimination rate (efficacy population) in the isepamicin and amikacin treatment groups was 75/76 (99%) vs 35/38 (92%). Nephrotoxicity, defined as an increase in serum creatinine of 0.5 mg/dL or > or = 44.2 mumol/L from baseline, occurred in 4/187 (2%) and 1/191 (1%) children treated with isepamicin and amikacin, respectively. Definite ototoxicity at the > or = 20 dB threshold occurred in 3 (1 isepamicin and 2 amikacin) out of 56 children evaluated with at least two audiograms. Thus isepamicin was as effective and as well tolerated as amikacin in the treatment of various infections in paediatric patients.
TI  - Primosome assembly site in Bacillus subtilis.
AB  - A single-strand initiation site was detected on the Enterococcus faecalis plasmid pAM beta 1 by its ability to prevent accumulation of single stranded DNA of a rolling circle plasmid, both in Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus. This site, designated ssiA, is located on the lagging strand template, approximately 150 bp downstream from the replication origin. ssiA priming activity requires the DnaE primase, the DnaC replication fork helicase, as well as the products of the dnaB, dnaD and dnaI genes of B.subtilis, but not the RNA polymerase. The primase and the replication fork helicase requirements indicate that ssiA is a primosome assembly site. Interestingly, the pAM beta 1 lagging strand synthesis is inefficient when any of the proteins involved in ssiA activity is mutated, but occurs efficiently in the absence of ssiA. This suggests that normal plasmid replication requires primosome assembly and that the primosome can assemble not only at ssiA but also elsewhere on the plasmid. This work for the first time describes a primosome in a Gram-positive bacterium. Involvement of the B.subtilis proteins DnaB, DnaD and DnaI, which do not have any known analogue in Escherichia coli, raises the possibility that primosome assembly and/or function in B.subtilis differs from that in E.coli.
TI  - Sepsis in children with human immunodeficiency virus infection. The Madrid HIV Pediatric Infection Collaborative Study Group.
AB  - The aims of this retrospective study were to review the frequency and patterns of bacterial sepsis in children infected with human immunodeficiency virus. The charts of 233 human immunodeficiency virus-infected children cared for during a 10-year period in 4 tertiary hospitals in Madrid were reviewed. There were 43 episodes of sepsis in 31 (13%) children. Twenty of them had acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, 10 were class PA2 and 1 was class P1B. The most common organisms recovered were: nontyphoidal Salmonella, 10 cases (23%); Streptococcus pneumoniae, 9 cases (21%); Staphylococcus epidermidis, 6 cases (14%); Escherichia coli, 5 cases (12%); Enterococcus faecalis, 4 cases (9%); Campylobacter jejuni, 2 cases (5%). In 28 episodes of bacteremia there were other sites of associated infection: pneumonia, 6 cases; urinary tract infection (UTI), 5 cases; gastrointestinal disease, 4 cases; catheter-related bacteremia, 12 cases. Eight patients had more than 1 episode of bacteremia. The rate of complications was high: 6 children had septic shock; and 2 of them developed disseminated intravascular coagulation. There was 1 death directly related to sepsis.

TI  - Bacteriologic, histologic and ultrasonographic findings in strictures recurring after urethrotomy. A preliminary study.
AB  - Twelve men with recurrent anterior urethral stricture after endoscopic urethrotomy (2-12 attempts) underwent open urethroplasty with en bloc removal of diseased urethral segments. Bacteriologic and histologic studies of the excised urethral tracts (mucosa and spongiosum tissue) were performed. The bacteriologic findings were compared with the results of preoperative urine cultures and urethral swabs for chlamydia. The histologic findings were related to preoperative ultrasonographic observations, in order to evaluate the accuracy of ultrasonography in depicting structural changes in spongiosum around the strictured urethral tract. Beta-haemolytic streptococci and Streptococcus faecalis were cultured from the excised spongiosum, without correlation to the preoperative culture results. The histologic studies confirmed the usefulness of urethral ultrasonography for accurate demonstration of the inflammatory changes involving spongiosum around the strictures.
TI  - Experimental investigations on the immunomodulating activity of polybacterial preparation for peroral immunotherapy and immunoprophylaxis of uroinfections.
AB  - The immunomodulating effect of a polybacterial immunostimulator Urostim in experimental animal models was investigated. The preparation was created for immunotherapy and immunoprophylaxis of uroinfections. It consists of killed bacterial cells and their lysates of four microbial species: Escherichia coli expressing type 1 pili, Rc mutant of E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Enterococcus faecalis, BALB/c mice and guinea-pigs were treated orally with Urostim for 5 or 10 days, respectively. A stimulatory effect of Urostim on phagocytosis (increased phagocytic index and phagocytic number) of mice peritoneal exudate cells was observed. An increased number of plaque-forming cells and elevated titres of haemagglutinating antibodies in mice demonstrated activation of humoral immunity. Lymphoproliferative studies showed a significant response to phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) and Urostim, especially after the second application of the preparation. At the same time no changes in the absolute number of peripheral blood lymphocytes were found. An active protection of mice against a systemic infection and of guinea-pigs against uroinfection caused by Gram-negative bacteria was obtained. In conclusion, the results obtained characterize Urostim as an effective immunostimulator. Its peroral application leads to the activation of innate resistance, cell-mediated, humoral and local immunity.

TI  - Targeted disruption of the PD78 gene (traF) reduces pheromone-inducible conjugal  transfer of the bacteriocin plasmid pPD1 in Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - Bacterial sex pheromone, cPD1, induces sexual aggregation of Enterococcus faecalis harboring the bacteriocin plasmid, pPD1, and enables pPD1 to transfer at high frequency in a liquid culture. PD78 is a cPD1-inducible cell surface protein encoded by pPD1. The PD78 gene, traF, was disrupted by homologous recombination between pPD1 and an artificial vector having a deletion in the middle portion of traF. The disruption of traF did not affect the cPD1-inducible aggregation but reduced the transfer frequency of pPD1 to 2% of the wild-type level.
TI  - Are traditional prognostic criteria useful in pancreatic abscess?
AB  - Pancreatic abscess remains a potentially lethal disease. Efforts to relate outcome to the severity of associated pancreatitis or the type of surgical drainage employed have yielded conflicting results. This study was designed to test the validity of traditional prognostic criteria in the clinical setting of pancreatic abscess and to determine whether the technique of surgical drainage employed correlated with survival. The records of 40 consecutive patients with pancreatic abscess were reviewed. In each case the diagnosis was confirmed by operation. Prognostic factors analyzed included number of Ranson criteria, etiology, type, and number of microorganisms isolated, extent of abscess, time to diagnosis and operation, and technique of surgical drainage. Of the 11 Ranson criteria evaluated, only an elevation in blood urea nitrogen > 5 mg/dl correlated with decreased survival (p < 0.001). Polymicrobial abscesses (three or more organisms) resulted in a higher mortality than abscesses where fewer than three organisms were isolated (45.4 vs 13.8%; p < 0.05). Intraperitoneal extension of the abscess was associated with an increased mortality rate compared to those confined to the retroperitoneum (57.1 vs 15.2%; p < 0.01). In patients requiring unplanned reexploration, mortality was significantly increased (42.9 vs 11.5%; p < 0.05). The technique of surgical drainage employed (open versus closed) did not influence overall mortality (23.5 vs 21.7%; p = NS). Extent of disease at operation, polymicrobial abscess, reexploration for persistent or recurrent disease, and deterioration in renal function were all predictive of increased mortality in cases of pancreatic abscess.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - TOC-39, a novel parenteral broad-spectrum cephalosporin with excellent activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - TOC-39, a new parenteral cephalosporin, is a hydroxyimino-type cephem antibiotic  with vinylthio-pyridyl moiety at the 3 position. TOC-39 was evaluated for antibacterial activity against various clinically isolated strains. TOC-39 had excellent activity, stronger than that of methicillin, oxacillin, the cephalosporins tested, imipenem, gentamicin, minocycline, tobramycin, ofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and had an MIC comparable to that of vancomycin (the MICs of TOC-39 and vancomycin for 90% of the strains tested were 3.13 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively). Against Enterococcus faecalis strains, which are resistant to cephalosporins, TOC-39 was twice as active as ampicillin. Against methicillin-susceptible S. aureus, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp., and Streptococcus pneumoniae, TOC-39 was twice as active as or more active than cefotiam, ceftazidime, flomoxef, and cefpirome. Against Streptococcus pyogenes, TOC-39 was superior to cefotiam, ceftazidime, and flomoxef and was similar to cefpirome. In addition, the activity of TOC-39 was equal to or greater than that of cefotiam, ceftazidime, flomoxef, and cefpirome against Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Morganella morganii. In terms of bactericidal effect against MRSA, TOC-39 was superior to vancomycin. No mutant resistant to TOC-39 or vancomycin was obtained from susceptible MRSA strains. In murine systemic infection models, TOC-39 showed potent activity against S. aureus and E. coli. Against highly MRSA, the activity of TOC-39 was comparable to that of vancomycin.
TI  - Rapid identification of common human pathogens by high-resolution proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
AB  - Routine procedures for recovery of bacteria from clinical specimens involve culturing the latter on various nonselective and selective agar media. The bacteria are then identified by means of biochemical and immunological test procedures. Reduction of the time required to identify the bacteria is highly desirable for rapid clinical diagnosis. Towards this end the potential of proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy for providing a "fingerprint" within the proton spectrum of five bacterial genera, reflecting their characteristic cell wall constituents, has been investigated. Establishing a database of high-resolution proton NMR spectra of a large number of bacterial species is a prerequisite for attaining this objective. A database has been established for five common human pathogens: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis. On the basis of the presence of characteristic resonances in their spectra, a simple algorithm has been developed to differentiate and identify these microorganisms. The NMR spectra of E. coli and S. aureus showed no dependency on the type of growth medium, growth density, or incubation time.
TI  - Bioavailability and bacterial degradation of rectally administered 2-chloro-2'-deoxyadenosine.
AB  - 2-Chloro-2'-deoxyadenosine (CdA) is a new drug for the treatment of hairy cell leukemia and other lymphoproliferative diseases. It is generally administered as a continuous intravenous infusion during 5-7 days. The oral bioavailability is only 50%. The bioavailability after rectal administration was investigated in two patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Five milligrams per square metre was given i.v. as a 2-h infusion and 24 h later the same dose was administered rectally in a gel formulation. The mean bioavailability was only 21% due to deglycosylation of CdA to 2-chloroadenine (CAde). To further elucidate the factors which are important for the rectal availability of CdA, the in vitro stability of CdA in bacterial cultures was tested. Clostridium perfringens and Escherichia coli as well as whole feces rapidly deglycosylated CdA to CAde while Bacteroides fragilis, Enterococcus faecalis as well as saliva only degraded CdA slowly or not at all. It is concluded that, due to bacterial degradation, rectal administration of CdA has no advantage over oral administration.
TI  - Efficacies of ABT-719 and related 2-pyridones, members of a new class of antibacterial agents, against experimental bacterial infections.
AB  - The 2-pyridones are a new class of broad-spectrum orally bioavailable antibacterial agents. These compounds are potent bacterial DNA gyrase inhibitors which differ from fluoroquinolones by placement of the nitrogen atom in the ring juncture. ABT-719 is an S isomer and a representative 2-pyridone. ABT-719 administered orally or subcutaneously was 4- to 10-fold more effective than ciprofloxacin against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes infections in normal mice. ABT-719 was equivalent in efficacy to ciprofloxacin for treatment of gram-negative bacterial infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Escherichia coli. The racemate and R forms of ABT-719 produced similar results against gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial infections. The 50% effective doses of ABT-719 were at least threefold lower than those of ciprofloxacin for therapy of intracellular infections caused by Salmonella typhimurium or Listeria monocytogenes. In immunosuppressed mice, ABT-719 was more effective than ciprofloxacin against quinolone-sensitive S. aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Enterococcus faecium. The pharmacokinetic properties of ABT-719 were consistent with its relative efficacy. The 2-pyridones are potent, orally available antibacterial agents with efficacy against gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial infections in mice.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activities of sulbactam/ampicillin against clinically isolated microbial strains].
AB  - Antimicrobial activities were examined for sulbactam/ampicillin (SBT/ABPC) against clinically isolated microbial strains in 1987, 1990, 1994. Besides, the beta-lactamase productivity and MICs of these strains were measured, and the following conclusions were obtained. 1. The ratio of beta-lactamase producing strains were 90% of methicillin (DMPPC)-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus subsp. aureus (MSSA), about 80% of DMPPC-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), 100% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis, 95% of Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis and 15-20% of Haemophilus influenzae. Several kinds of beta-lactamase productivity were observed. 2. Antimicrobial activities of SBT/ABPC against beta-lactamase producing strains of MSSA, M. (B.) catarrhalis, H. influenzae, and almost all of Enterobacteriaceae were stronger than those of ampicillin (ABPC) and piperacillin (PIPC), but antimicrobial activities of SBT/ABPC were weak against MRSA and cephems (CEPs)-resistant strains detected in some of Enterobacteriaceae. 3. It appeared that benzylpenicillin (PCG)-insensitive Streptococcus pneumoniae (PISP) or PCG-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP) and CEPs-resistant Escherichia coli increased year by year. 4. Antimicrobial activities of SBT/ABPC were strong against Streptococcus pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, M. (B.) catarrhalis and H. influenzae including beta-lactamase producing strains. Additionally, beta-lactamase inhibiting effect of SBT was observed against beta-lactamase produced by S. aureus and K. pneumoniae which demonstrate indirect pathogenicity. Thus, SBT/ABPC is an injectable antibiotic that is expected to demonstrate clinical usefulness, especially as the first line drug for the respiratory tract infections that are community-acquired.
TI  - Environmental contamination by organisms causing urinary tract infection.
AB  - We have examined the bedsheets, floor and bedside chairs of 33 patients with urinary tract infections for organisms causing urinary infection. In ten patients the causative organism was recovered from the undersheet, and in two of these it was also recovered from the floor and bedside chair. Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterococcus faecalis were recovered from sheets, while Group B beta-haemolytic streptococci and Candida tropicalis were also found on floors and chairs.
TI  - Prevalence and antibiotic sensitivity of Danish versus other European bacterial isolates from intensive care and hematology/oncology units.
AB  - The prevalence and antibiotic sensitivity patterns of bacteria collected consecutively from medical and surgical intensive care units (ICUs) and from hematology/oncology units in nine hospitals in Denmark were determined and compared to data collected simultaneously in 12 other European countries. Bacterial isolates from 794 Danish patients were tested and compared to 8,625 isolates from European patients. The minimal inhibitory concentrations of eight different antibiotics were determined using a microdilution plate. Similar to findings in European countries, the most common source of bacterial isolates in Danish units was the respiratory tract (49%), followed by blood (18%), urinary tract (14%) and surgical wounds (10%). Staphylococcus aureus was the most prevalent respiratory organism in Danish units, whereas Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa dominated in other countries. In blood, Escherichia coli was most prevalent in Denmark while coagulase-negative staphylococci were predominant in other countries. Urinary tract isolates were dominated by Escherichia coli in both Denmark and the other countries, but Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were more frequently isolated in the other countries. Staphylococcus aureus was the most frequent wound isolate in Denmark, while Enterobacteriaceae other than Escherichia coli dominated in other European countries. Thus, in Denmark Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella spp. (from ICUs) or Enterococcus spp. and Klebsiella spp. (from hematology/oncology units), are the most prominent pathogens in these units today. Indicator organisms of antibiotic consumption (Pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci and Staphylococcus aureus) were more frequent in other European countries than Denmark. In general the Danish isolates were more sensitive to antibiotics than the European isolates.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Molecular cloning and nucleotide sequence of the gene encoding the major peptidoglycan hydrolase of Lactococcus lactis, a muramidase needed for cell separation.
AB  - A gene of Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris MG1363 encoding a peptidoglycan hydrolase was identified in a genomic library of the strain in pUC19 by screening Escherichia coli transformants for cell wall lysis activity on a medium containing autoclaved, lyophilized Micrococcus lysodeikticus cells. In cell extracts of L. lactis MG1363 and several halo-producing E. coli transformants, lytic bands of similar sizes were identified by denaturing sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gels containing L. lactis or M. lysodeikticus cell walls. Of these clearing bands, corresponding to the presence of lytic enzymes with sizes of 46 and 41 kDa, the 41-kDa band was also present in the supernatant of an L. lactis culture. Deletion analysis of one of the recombinant plasmids showed that the information specifying lytic activity was contained within a 2,428-bp EcoRV-Sau3A fragment. Sequencing of part of this fragment revealed a gene (acmA) that could encode a polypeptide of 437 amino acid residues. The calculated molecular mass of AcmA (46,564 Da) corresponded to that of one of the lytic activities detected. Presumably, the enzyme is synthesized as a precursor protein which is processed by cleavage after the Ala at position 57, thus producing a mature protein with a size of 40,264 Da, which would correspond to the size of the enzyme whose lytic activity was present in culture supernatants of L. lactis. The N-terminal region of the mature protein showed 60% identity with the N-terminal region of the mature muramidase-2 of Enterococcus hirae and the autolysin of Streptococcus faecalis. Like the latter two enzymes, AcmA contains C-terminal repeated regions. In AcmA, these three repeats are separated by nonhomologous intervening sequences highly enriched in serine, threonine, and asparagine. Genes specifying identical activities were detected in various strains of L. lactis subsp. lactis and L. lactis subsp. cremoris by the SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis detection assay and PCR experiments. By replacement recombination, an acmA deletion mutant which grew as long chains was constructed, indicating that AcmA is required for cell separation.
TI  - Development of wound infection or separation after cesarean delivery. Prospective evaluation of 2,431 cases.
AB  - Wound infections are a common surgical complication, often requiring a prolonged  hospital stay and leading to increased costs. Over a one-year period, 2,431 patients were followed after cesarean delivery with prompt evaluation and culture of all suspicious wounds. Seventy subjects (2.8%) developed confirmed wound infection, and 42 (1.7%) developed noninfected open surgical wounds. Seven (0.3%) fascial dehiscences were diagnosed, requiring surgical repair. Forty of 63 (64%) infected wounds had positive bacterial cultures, with Staphylococcus epidermidis (29%), Enterococcus faecalis (17%), Staphylococcus aureus (17%), Escherichia coli (11%) and Proteus mirabilis (10%) the most frequent isolates. Only 7 of 42 (17%) noninfected wounds had positive cultures, with only S aureus, S epidermidis and Corynebacterium species isolated. Ninety-five percent of the noninfected wounds had blood or serous collections present. Rupture of membranes lasting longer than six hours, emergency cesarean delivery and morbid obesity were associated with a statistically increased likelihood of the development of infected wounds. Emergency cesarean delivery and morbid obesity, but not prolonged rupture of membranes, were associated with an increased likelihood of the development of noninfected wounds. Therefore, it appears that at least two mechanisms are responsible for the development of postcesarean open wounds: (1) increased amniotic fluid and wound colonization due to prolonged rupture of membranes, resulting in a wound infection containing one or more bacterial species derived from the cervicovaginal flora, and (2) increased exogenous bacterial contamination and flora consistent with skin species or breaks in sterile technique, often accompanying difficult or emergency surgery.
TI  - [Nationwide survey on susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents in 1991].
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical isolates to  different antibacterial agents at 123 hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1991. In this study, identifications and susceptibility testings were carried out at each hospital laboratory. The susceptibility testing were performed using the disk dilution method recommended by NCCLS. Staphylococcus aureus and CNS showed high or moderate resistance rates to methicillin (DMPPC). Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Proteus mirabilis were highly susceptible to many agents including beta-lactam antibiotics. Though Enterococcus faecalis was highly susceptible to ampicillin (ABPC), piperacillin (PIPC), imipenem (IPM), sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (ST) compounds, Enterococcus faecium was resistant to almost all antibacterial agents but to ST compounds. High susceptibility rates were observed for strains of Enterobacter cloacae to IPM, gentamicin (GM) and ofloxacin (OFLX) and for strains of Proteus vulgaris to latamoxef (LMOX), IPM, aztreonam (AZT), GM and OFLX. Serratia marcescens and Bacteroides fragilis group were highly susceptible only to IPM. Pseudomonas aeruginosa were sensitive to ceftazidime (CAZ), IPM, amikacin (AMK) and tobramycin (TOB). Pseudomonas cepacia was relatively susceptible only to CAZ. IPM showed strong antibacterial activity to many species except for S. aureus and CNS.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of apalcillin alone and combined with Ro 48-1220, a novel penam beta-lactamase inhibitor.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The in vitro activity of apalcillin plus Ro 48-1220, a novel penam sulfone beta-lactamase inhibitor, was compared with apalcillin alone, piperacillin/tazobactam, ticarcillin/clavulanic acid, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, imipenem, ceftazidime and cefepime. METHODS: Agar dilution and broth microdilution testing of 854 bacterial strains, subcultured from frozen stocks incubated for 24 h in 5% carbon dioxide, was carried out to determine the minimum bactericidal (MBC) and minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of each of the study drugs in accordance with the NCCLS M26-T method. RESULTS: Apalcillin/Ro 48-1220 was active against all gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic isolates except Klebsiella oxytoca (MIC90 32 microg/mL). Among the Enterobacteriaceae, synergy for apalcillin/Ro 48-1220 (4 microg/mL fixed concentration) vs apalcillin alone was demonstrated for nearly all species when comparing MIC90 results. Apalcillin/Ro 48-1220 was highly potent against beta-lactamase-producing Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (MICs less-than-or-equal 1 microg/mL). However, much of this activity was due to the direct antimicrobial action of Ro 48-1220 alone (MICs less-than-or-equal 4 microg/mL). All Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas (Xanthomonas) maltophilia and Acinetobacter species were inhibited by apalcillin/Ro 48-1220 (MIC90 0.25 to 4 microg/mL). For the aerobic gram-positive organisms, none of the drugs tested were consistently effective against oxacillin-resistant staphylococci, Corynebacterium jeikeium and Enterococcus species other than E. faecalis. Apalcillin/Ro 48-1220 was as effective as piperacillin/tazobactam against Escherichia coli producing extended-spectrum TEM enzymes, but less active against isolates producing SHV-type beta-lactamases. When tested against 204 ceftazidime-, gentamicin- or fluoroquinolone-resistant organisms, 78%, 91% and 66% of strains, respectively, were susceptible to apalcillin/Ro 48-1220 (less-than-or-equal 16 microg/mL). CONCLUSIONS: Apalcillin/Ro 48-1220 is bactericidal with a modest inoculum effect; its wide spectrum of activity favors continued studies of spectrum, pharmacokinetics and in vivo efficacy.
TI  - Recombinant expression and evaluation of the lipoyl domains of the dihydrolipoyl  acetyltransferase component of the human pyruvate dehydrogenase complex.
AB  - The subunits of the dihydrolipoyl acetyltransferase (E2) component of mammalian pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) associate to form a large inner core with a protruding structure composed of three globular domains connected by mobile linker regions. This exterior region of E2 includes two lipoyl domains which engage not only in the intermediate reactions of the complex but also have integral roles in the kinase-phosphatase regulatory interconversion of the pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1) component. To facilitate understanding of these roles, lipoyl domain constructs of the E2 component of human PDC were expressed as glutathione S-transferase (GST)-linked fusion proteins from plasmid inserts prepared by polymerase chain reaction procedures. The NH2-terminal lipoyl domain, E2L1, and the interior lipoyl domain, E2L2, are connected by a 30-amino-acid hinge region, H1. Constructs designed and expressed were E2L1(1-98), E2L1.H1(1-128), E2L2(120-233), E2H1.L2(98-233), and E2L1.H1.L2(1-233), where numbers in parentheses give the amino acid sequence for the portions of the E2 component incorporated into a construct. The domains were expressed in Escherichia coli with and without lipoate supplementation. GST constructs were purified to homogeneity by affinity chromatography and selectively released by thrombin treatment. Sequencing of insert DNAs and NH2-terminal sequencing confirmed that domains were produced as designed. Measurement of masses by electrospray mass spectrometry indicated that constructs with lipoylated, nonlipoylated, and octanoylated forms were produced when expression was with E. coli grown without lipoate supplementation and that fully lipoylated forms were produced upon lipoate supplementation. The lipoylation status was confirmed, following delipoylation with Enterococcus faecalis lipoamidase, by the expected decrease in mass and by the observation in native gel electrophoresis of a shift to a slower mobility (possibly less compact) form. Constructs were used in E1-catalyzed reductive-acetylation reaction in proportion to their degree of lipoylation and were effective substrates in a NADH-dependent dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase reduction reaction. Thus, we have produced lipoyl domain constructs that can be employed in sorting the specific roles of E2L1 and E2L2 in facilitating catalytic and regulatory processes.
TI  - Cloning of an Enterococcus faecalis endocarditis antigen: homology with adhesins  from some oral streptococci.
AB  - Serum from a patient with Enterococcus faecalis endocarditis was used to identify the gene efaA cloned in Lambda ZapII in Escherichia coli. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed a 924-bp open reading frame encoding a protein with a predicted molecular weight of 34,768. The amino acid sequence of EfaA shows 55 to 60% homology to a group of streptococcal proteins, FimA from Streptococcus parasanguis, SsaB from Streptococcus sanguis, ScaA from Streptococcus gordonii, and PsaA from Streptococcus pneumoniae. Members of this group have been shown to be adhesins, and we hypothesize that EfaA may function as an adhesin in endocarditis.
TI  - Synthesis and biological properties of a series of optically active 2-oxaisocephems.
AB  - A novel series of (6S, 7S)-3,7-disubstituted-8-oxo-1-aza-4-oxabicyclo[4.2.0]oct-2-ene-2- carboxylic acids 9a-o, parenteral optically active 2-oxaisocephems, was synthesized, and in vitro and in vivo activities were determined against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The 7-[2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-2-(Z)-cyclopentyloxyimino]acet arnido derivatives, 9g, 9m and 9o, had enhanced antibacterial activity against Gram-positive organisms including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Enterococcus faecalis while maintaining Gram-negative activity. It is also significant that these compounds showed more potent activity against MRSA and E. faecalis isolates than cefuzonam (10) and flomoxef (12), which are the most popular third-generation antibiotics. The combination of the 7-[2-(aminothiazol-4-yl)-2-(Z)-cyclopentyloxyimino]acetamido group and 2-oxaisocephem nucleus contributes to the increased antibacterial activity against these clinical isolates. The 7-[2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-2-(Z)-cyclopentyloxyimino]acet ami do derivative 9g provided good subcutaneous efficacy and exhibited more potent activity than cefmenoxime (11) against the systemic infection with S. aureus Smith in mice. The compound 9a with a [2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-2-(Z)-methoxyimino]acetamido group at the 7-position showed high in vivo efficacy on the experimental infection caused by Escherichia coli No. 29 in mice.
TI  - [Bacteriological and clinical studies of SY5555 in pediatric field].
AB  - Clinical studies were carried out on SY5555, a new oral penem, in the field of pediatrics. The results obtained are summarized below. The clinical efficacies were examined in a total 31 patients consisting of 4 patients with pharyngitis, 10 with purulent tonsillitis, 4 with scarlet fever, 7 with impetigo, one with balanitis, one with cellulitis and 4 with UTI. The clinical efficacy rate was 96.8% (30/31). Bacteriological efficacies of SY5555 were examined on identified pathogens including 7 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 6 of Streptococcus pyogenes, 3 of Enterococcus faecalis, 3 of Haemophilus influenzae, one of Escherichia coli and one of Citrobacter freundii. The bacteriological eradication rate was 81.0%. As for side effects, loose stool in one patient was noted. Abnormal laboratory findings test results included eosinophilia in 2 patients, eosinophilia and elevation of serum transaminase in one patient, and thrombocytosis in another.
TI  - Conjugative transposition of Tn916-related elements from Enterococcus faecalis to Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas fluorescens.
AB  - We studied the ability of transposons Tn916, Tn1545, and Tn916-Km, a Tn916 derivative expressing kanamycin resistance, to be conjugatively transferred from Enterococcus faecalis to various gram-negative bacteria. Our results demonstrate that these types of elements can carry out conjugative transposition from the chromosome of E. faecalis to those of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas fluorescens and that the accomplishment of this event depends on the donor potential of the E. faecalis transposon delivery strain. Since the tet(M) gene does not confer a selectable level of tetracycline resistance to gram-negative bacteria such as E. coli, the presence of another marker(s) readily expressed in these recipients is required for the detection of this type of transfer. Conjugal transfer of Tn916-Km from E. faecalis to E. coli is not restricted by the EcoK restriction system, nor does it depend on the presence of functional homologous recombination system and integration host factor proteins in the recipient bacteria.
TI  - The effects of X-ray contrast media on bacterial growth.
AB  - Six widely used X-ray contrast media (XRC) were tested against nine commonly isolated organisms to determine the practicality of using XRC to outline body spaces prior to obtaining specimens for culture and to assess the feasibility of using XRC in divided doses to reduce cost. Preparations of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus milleri in two approximate concentrations of 10(4) and 10(8) colony forming units/mL (cfu/mL) were inoculated into the following XRC: Conray 280, Hexabrix 320, lopamiro 370, Omnipaque 350, Ultravist 300 and Optiray 320 each in two concentrations. Sampling was performed in triplicate at 0, 2, 4 and 20 h with the 20 h counts made after exposure at both 22 degrees C and 4 degrees C. There were 16 significant interactions, predominantly with the Gram-negative organisms. Conray 280 produced the greatest number of effects. Most effects were bacteriostatic. Organisms were most susceptible at low concentration and after prolonged contact with XRC. No effect was seen with dilute XRC. All weekly sterility checks were negative. Non-ionic XRC have no significant effect on the growth of Gram-positive organisms and little effect on Gram-negative organisms if processing is performed promptly. Using standard aseptic technique, no contamination of XRC occurred, suggesting multi-dosing may be a safe and cost-effective method of XRC utilization.
TI  - Antibacterial effect of substituted 4-quinazolyl-hydrazines and their arylhydrazones determined by a modified microdilution method.
AB  - Eight 4-quinazolylhydrazines and eleven their arylhydrazones have been tested for antibacterial effects and for structure-activity relationships by a modified microdilution method. The derivative 6-chloro-2-morpholino-4-quinazolyl-5'-nitro-2'-furylhydrazone++ + had the highest antibacterial effect, the MIC values being 100 mg/L for E. faecalis, 250 mg/L for S. aureus, 200 mg/L for P. aeruginosa and 350 mg/L for E. coli. The most effective derivatives were those with the benzene ring substituted with chlorine or methyl group in position 6 or 8 and with pyrimidine ring substituted with a secondary amine in position 2. The modified microdilution method did not give rise to any statistically significant deviations in the MIC values for ampicillin in comparison with reported reference collection values.

TI  - Growth conditions influence expression of cell surface hydrophobicity of staphylococci and other wound infection pathogens.
AB  - The initial adhesion of microbes to tissue and solid surfaces can be mediated by  hydrophobic interaction. Expression of microbial cell surface hydrophobicity (CSH) is influenced by growth conditions, and often best expressed after growth under nutrient-poor conditions, or "starvation". In the present study, the CSH of 133 strains of Enterobacteriaceae, Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Enterococcus faecalis, group A streptococcus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Clostridium perfringens, Bacteroides fragilis, Peptococcus magnus, and of 8 Candida albicans strains was measured by the salt aggregation test after growth on hematin agar in a 5% CO2 atmosphere, or under anaerobiosis. Cells of all but 8 strains expressed pronounced or moderate CSH, i.e., they aggregated in 0.01-2 M ammonium sulfate. When the agar surface was covered by human serum (diluted 1:5) to mimic growth conditions in a wound, 94 strains expressed higher CSH, and 44 strains the same CSH as after growth without serum. The CSH of 12 strains of different species was measured after growth on blood, hematin and PDM agar, with or without serum, and in an aerobic or a 5% CO2 atmosphere. The highest CSH was expressed after growth in 5% CO2 with serum, and the lowest growth after on blood agar in aerobic atmosphere. Identical results were obtained with native and heat-inactivated (56 C, 20 min) serum. The reduced surface tension obtained in 5% CO2, as well as yet unidentified serum factors, promotes expression of CSH.
TI  - Effects of silver on adherence of bacteria to urinary catheters: in vitro studies.
AB  - Strains of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, and Klebsiella pneumoniae, mostly from complicated urinary tract infections, showed reduced adherence to silver-treated silicone or latex catheters as compared with latex or silicone catheters. The relative degrees of cell adherence to catheters at 2 h or 18 h, as indicated by radiolabeled cell assays, were in general agreement with growth rate-reduction assays and scanning-electron-microscopy data. For strains of E. coli, the correlation between cell hydrophobicity and degree of adherence to catheters was not significant. Antibiotic resistance (tetracycline, sulfathiazine, neomycin, kanamycin) and silver resistance were not associated. The radiolabel adherence procedure provided a quantitative method for evaluating the relative antimicrobial efficacy of silver-treated catheters.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological, and clinical studies on SY5555 in children].
AB  - Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies on SY5555 were performed in children. The results were as follows: 1. A total of 15 patients considered to have bacterial infections were treated with SY5555. Each dose, 5 mg/kg, was orally administered 3 times daily, for 4-11 days. Clinical efficacies of SY5555 in 13 patients with bacterial infections (1 with pneumonia, 2 with bronchitis, each 1 with maxillary sinusitis, 2 with otitis media, 5 with pharyngitis, 1 each with gastroenteritis and pyelonephritis) were evaluated as excellent in 10 patients and as good in 3 patients with an efficacy rate of 100%. Two patients with viral infection and malignant lymphoma were not evaluated. Thirteen causative strains in 7 species were found in 10 patients. Streptococcus pneumoniae in 1/3, Haemophilus influenzae in 2/2, Streptococcus pyogenes 4/4, Salmonella spp. in 1/1, Escherichia coli in 1/1 were eradicated. Only one patient developed mild diarrhea as an adverse reaction. Another patient showed elevated GPT (glutamate pyruvate transaminase). The abnormality was mild and the patient recovered after the cessation of SY5555 administration without specific treatment. 2. MICs of SY5555 were examined against 33 clinical isolates. SY5555 has low MICs against Enterococcus faecalis and other Gram-positive cocci. 3. Pharmacokinetic studies Peak plasma concentrations of SY5555 was 1.15 micrograms/ml at a dose level of 4.9 mg/kg orally administered at fasting. Based on the above results and the broad spectrum of the anti-bacterial activities, SY5555 appears to be a promising antibiotics that is usable as a single agent for the primary therapy of respiratory tract infections, skin soft tissue infections and urinary tract infections in children.
TI  - Interpretive criteria and quality control parameters for testing bacterial susceptibility to the fluoroquinolone PD131628.
AB  - For testing bacterial susceptibility to PD131628, a 5-micrograms disk and the following tentative interpretive criteria may be used: > or = 19 mm for susceptible (MIC, < or = 1.0 micrograms/ml), 16 to 18 mm for intermediate (MIC, 2.0 micrograms/ml), and < or = 15 mm for resistant (MIC, > or = 4.0 micrograms/ml). For standard quality control strains, the following limits are proposed: for Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, zones of 31 to 41 mm or a MIC of 0.002 to 0.016 micrograms/ml; for Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, zones of 26 to 34 mm or a MIC of 0.12 to 0.5 micrograms/ml; for Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, zones of 27 to 33 mm; for Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213, a MIC of 0.03 to 0.12 micrograms/ml; and for Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, a MIC of 0.12 to 0.5 micrograms/ml.
TI  - [Etiologic structure of infectious complications in the urogenital tract of oncologic patients].
AB  - The investigation of the microflora of infectious complications in the urogenital tract of oncological patients showed that in spite of the similarity of the microbiotypes, the microflora of the infectious complications in the patients had marked differences. The causative agents in urological patients were mainly monocultures (69.9 per cent), whereas in gynecological patients they were mainly associations (67.2 per cent), more frequently of 2 and sometimes of 3 and even 4 or 5 taxa. The taxonomic spectra of such pathogens were also different. In the urological patients a much broader spectrum of the bacterial species with the predominance of gram-negative rod-shaped bacteria was detected. In the gynecological patients the predominating taxa were Candida spp., Staphylococcus spp., Escherichia coli and S. faecalis. The other bacteria in total amounted to 13.9 per cent. In the urological patients the predominating taxa were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, E. coli, Candida spp. and S. faecalis. The frequency of Staphylococcus spp. and Candida spp. was twice as low as that in the gynecological patients. Therefore, the comparative investigation of the causative agents in the urinary tract and female genitalia of the oncological patients revealed significant differences which cast doubt on the validity of empirical antibacterial therapy according to the principle of "above and below the waist" practiced by many physicians in the treatment of infectious complications in somatic hospitals.
TI  - A plasmid-encoded surface protein on Enterococcus faecalis augments its internalization by cultured intestinal epithelial cells.
AB  - Aggregation substance, a plasmid-encoded Enterococcus faecalis surface protein, plays a role in mediating the formation of mating aggregates, resulting in plasmid transfer. The role of aggregation substance in the internalization of E. faecalis by cultured intestinal epithelial cells, namely HT-29 cells, was analyzed. It was associated with a significant increase in endocytosis of E. faecalis by HT-29 cells: Numbers of internalized enterococci were fewer than of an invasive strain of Listeria monocytogenes, similar to Salmonella typhimurium and another L. monocytogenes strain, and greater than relatively noninvasive strains of E. faecalis, Proteus mirabilis, and Escherichia coli. Electron microscopy confirmed aggregation substance on the surface of strains interacting with the enterocyte microvillous surface, and intracellular enterococci were localized within membrane-bound vacuoles in the enterocyte cytoplasm. Thus, aggregation substance may facilitate E. faecalis internalization by host epithelial cells.
TI  - [Effect of biapenem (L-627) on fecal flora in gnotobiotic mice and children].
AB  - Biapenem (L-627), a novel injectable carbapenem antibiotic, was studied with regard to its effect on mice inoculated with four types of bacteria and on the intestinal flora of pediatric patients. L-627 was given i.m., 40 mg/kg once daily for 5 consecutive days, to mice inoculated enterically with four types of bacteria (Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacteroides fragilis, and Bifidobacterium breve). Except for a mild decrease in E. coli, there were no major fluctuations in viable bacterial counts in the feces during the treatment. Five children with bacterial infections (3 boys and 2 girls; ages: 1 month to 7 years and 7 months; body weights 4.62-21.8 kg) were given L-627 at 6.0 to 11.7 mg/kg 3 times daily for 7 to 11 days. Among aerobes, although Enterobacteriaceae such as E. coli tended to decrease remarkably in all patients, there was no major change in Enterococcus. Consequently, total aerobe counts did not change significantly in any patient. Among anaerobes, Bifidobacterium, Bacteroides, and Eubacterium, which are the predominant organisms in infants, decreased remarkably in some patients. One of the patients showed a marked decrease in total anaerobe count associated with a change in fecal characteristics (diarrhea). Glucose nonfermenting Gram-negative bacilli or fungi did not become predominant organisms in any patient. Recovery from these changes in the intestinal flora was noted promptly after terminating L-627 treatment. L-627 was detected in the feces of 4 patients during treatment. The fecal concentration ranged from 0.24 to 2.22 micrograms/g. Clostridium difficile was not detected in any patient. Although C. difficile D-1 antigen was observed in 2 patients, it bore no relationship to fecal properties. The results indicated that L-627 had relatively few effects on the intestinal flora compared to other new beta-lactam antibiotics.
TI  - [Clinical study of a new injectable cephem, FK037, for acute bacterial prostatitis].
AB  - FK037, a new injectable cephem antibiotic, was administered in the treatment of 13 acute bacterial prostatitis (mean age 53.5, range 30-79), and its effectiveness and safety were evaluated. The human prostatic fluid (PF) concentration of FK037 on 7 specimens 1 hour after 1 g i.v.d., was in the range of 0.87-7.47 micrograms/ml (mean +/- SD, 3.43 +/- 2.23 micrograms/ml), whereas, the serum concentration averaged 45.3 +/- 2.88 micrograms/ml, the ratio of PF/serum consequently being 0.08 +/- 0.05. In the clinical study, 1g of FK037 was administered to 13 patients by i.v.d. twice a day for 7-9 days. Bacteriological eradication on expressed prostatic secretion (EPS) was obtained for all clinical isolates which included 11 strains of Escherichia coli (MIC < or = 0.05 microgram/ml), 2 of Enterococcus faecalis, and each one of Staphylococcus aureus and Morganella morganii. Symptomatical cure was 100% in all cases. As for safety profile, no side effects were noted. In laboratory values, slight elevation of transaminase were detected in 3 cases, but they were transient and returned to normal 1-2 weeks after completion of the therapy. We conclude that FK037 is highly effective in the treatment of acute bacterial prostatitis, and is well tolerated in comparison with other relative antimicrobials.
TI  - In vitro activity of SCE-2787, a new cephalosporin with potent activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and members of the family Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - The in vitro activity of SCE-2787, 7-[(Z)-2-(5-amino-1,2,4-thiadiazol-3- yl)-2-methoxyiminoacetamido]-3-(1-imidazo[1,2-b]pyridazinium)methy l-3- cephem-4-carboxylate, was compared with those of ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, and imipenem against recent clinical isolates. SCE-2787 inhibited 50% of tested isolates of the family Enterobacteriaceae at < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml. SCE-2787 was equally active as or more active than ceftazidime and ceftriaxone against members of the Enterobacteriaceae, with the exception of Proteus vulgaris. The MIC of SCE-2787 at which 90% of the isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were inhibited was 2 micrograms/ml, two- to fourfold lower than those of imipenem and ceftazidime, respectively. SCE-2787, like ceftazidime and imipenem, did not inhibit the majority of strains of Pseudomonas cepacia and Xanthomonas maltophilia. SCE-2787 inhibited beta-hemolytic streptococci at < or = 0.12 micrograms/ml, but it did not inhibit Enterococcus faecalis, Listeria monocytogenes, or the anaerobic species tested. Methicillin-resistant staphylococci required SCE-2787 MICs of > or = 16 micrograms/ml, whereas methicillin-susceptible staphylococci were inhibited by 2 micrograms/ml. No difference between the MICs and MBCs was noted, except for P. aeruginosa, for which there was a fourfold difference. SCE-2787 was active over a pH range of 6 to 8. The inoculum size of 10(5) to 10(7) CFU caused only a twofold change in the MIC for Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus but a 4- to 16-fold change in Enterobacter cloacae and P. aeruginosa. beta-Lactamases from Bush groups 1, 2a, and 2b did not hydrolyze SCE-2787. There was significant hydrolysis of SCE-2787 by the beta-lactamases designated 2b', i.e., TEM-3, TEM-5, TEM-7, and TEM-9, and by the group 2d beta-lactamases. SCE-2787 had poor affinity for group 1 and group 2b enzymes and constitutively produced chromosomal beta-lactamases such as P-99 of Enterobacter cloacae and plasmid-mediated TEM-1 of E. coli. SCE-2787 has in vitro activity comparable to that of current parenteral cephalosporin and is more active against P. aeruginosa and S. aureus.
TI  - Purification and characterization of the VanB ligase associated with type B vancomycin resistance in Enterococcus faecalis V583.
AB  - Acquired resistance to glycopeptides in enterococci is associated with the production of D-Alanine:D-Alanine ligase-related proteins. The VanA protein associated with high-level vancomycin and teicoplanin resistance (VanA phenotype) synthesizes a new peptidoglycan precursor, D-alanine-D-lactate, that has reduced glycopeptide affinity. Production of a similar protein, VanB, is induced in strains that display variable levels of vancomycin resistance but remain susceptible to teicoplanin (VanB phenotype). This paper describes the over-production, purification and characterization of VanB. Comparison of kinetic parameters of the two Van enzymes suggests that differences in catalytic efficiency could account, at least in part, for the various levels of vancomycin resistance.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of quaternized heteroxylans.
AB  - A series of quaternized D-xylan polysaccharides, differing in the structural features of their macromolecular backbone, were tested for antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Activity was comparable with that of the cationic surfactant, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, and depended on the degree of quaternization and the structural backbone of the derivatives.
TI  - [Gardnerella vaginalis: transport, microscopy, testing resistance].
AB  - G. vaginalis is an important pathogen in the aetiology of bacterial vaginosis. Therefore, we investigated the influence of transport systems in isolation, a scoring system for Gram stains, and susceptibility to antimicrobial agents. The comparison between a simple (Transwab) and a sophisticated (Port-A-Cul) system showed no differences with regard to for instance Enterococcus faecalis or Escherichia coli; however, isolation of G. vaginalis, a fastidious microorganism, was significantly higher (alpha < 0.0001) in Port-A-Cul. There was a strong correlation (97.5%) using the scoring system indicating bacterial vaginosis and isolation of G. vaginalis. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of metronidazole for 60 strains of G. vaginalis were higher than 32 mg/l, some strains showing heteroresistance. This phenomenon may be an explanation for treatment failures. Clindamycin and erythromycin were much more active, with MIC's between 0.016 and 0.19 mg/l, in-vitro development of resistance being slower for clindamycin than for erythromycin. CONCLUSIONS: (I) for isolation of G. vaginalis, a sophisticated transport system is mandatory; (II) a scoring system for Gram staining is helpful in diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis; (III) in patients with metronidazole treatment failures, clindamycin should be used.
TI  - Differential elimination of enteric bacteria by protists in a freshwater system.
AB  - The short-term (1 h) and long-term (3 d) elimination of low and high densities of five enteric bacteria, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Aeromonas hydrophila, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus epidermidis, by flagellate and ciliate protists were measured in a freshwater system. In addition, the two processes, ingestion and digestion, which cause the disappearance of those enteric bacteria as time passes, were quantified. The results showed that the elimination of these enteric bacteria by protists depends on their initial density, which confirms that the lower the bacterial density the more difficult is their elimination. On the other hand, the short-term and long-term elimination rates of each enteric bacteria were different, and moreover, the order of priority for elimination in the two cases was not the same. Escherichia coli showed the highest elimination rate in short-term experiments, while Aer. hydrophila disappeared at highest rates in long-term experiments. This different order of priority in the elimination rates and the different digestion rates on the five enteric bacteria by phagotrophic protists indicated that the elimination in time is very much influenced by the digestive capacity on each enteric bacteria of those protists. Thus, the low digestion rates of Ent. faecalis and Staph. epidermidis by flagellates and ciliates as well as their low disappearance percentages in the long-term experiments confirm that enteric Gram-positive bacteria are eliminated from the aquatic systems at lower rates, because their digestion is difficult.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence of the 18-kb conjugative transposon Tn916 from Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - Conjugative transposon Tn916 from Enterococcus faecalis DS16 encodes tetracycline resistance (Tet M) as well as determinants necessary for its own movement. Determination of the nucleotide sequence of Tn916 has been completed. The element is 18,032 bp in length and has an overall G+C content of 38.8%. Twenty-four potential open reading frames (ORFs) were identified based on sequence analysis. Similarities of the ORFs to other known determinants, which were revealed by database searches, are discussed.
TI  - Cloning, sequencing and expression in Escherichia coli of the low-affinity penicillin binding protein of Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - Low-affinity penicillin binding proteins are particular membrane proteins, in several Gram-positive bacteria, which are involved in beta-lactam antibiotic resistance. The structural gene for the low-affinity penicillin binding protein 5 (PBP5) of Enterococcus faecalis was cloned and sequenced. From the sequence of the 3378 bp, a 2040 bp coding region was identified. From biochemical analysis it emerges that E. faecalis PBP5 is a type II membrane protein with an uncleaved N-terminal and is composed of 679 amino acids with a molecular weight of 74055. This protein showed 48 and 33% of identity with Enterococcus hirae PBP5 and Staphylococcus aureus PBP2a, both low-affinity PBPs involved in beta-lactam resistance. Anti-PBP5 antibodies cross-reacted with a membrane protein present in other species of enterococci, but the entire gene fragment cloned hybridized only with DNAs of E. faecalis strains, thus suggesting that genes coding for low-affinity PBPs of enterococci are not strictly homologous. In this experiment digoxigenin-labelled E. faecalis DNA was used.
TI  - [Experimental study on the role of bacteria from urinary tract infections on the  bladder carcinogenesis].
AB  - The role of bacteria isolated from patients with urinary tract infection (UTI) was studied with a view to the possibility that such bacteria are an etiological factor in the development of bladder cancer. The bacterial strains of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis, isolated from patients with UTI at the Kyushu University Hospital, were tested for their nitrate-reducing activity after 1 hr of incubation with sodium nitrate (3.57 mM) in a growth medium (pH 7.2) at 37 degrees C. Of 35 strains tested, 27 strains (77%) showed the ability to reduce nitrate to nitrite with yields ranging from 2 to 310 microM NO2-/hr/10(7) bacterial cells, but in 8 strains (23%) including all the 7 strains of E. faecalis no elevated activity (0.0-0.3 microM) could be detected. Various kinetic profiles were observed for the nitrate-reducing bacteria, at various rate ranging from rapidly to slowly, during 5 hr of incubation. The effect of nitrate-reducing bacteria on mutagen formation in the human urine was examined. The mutagenic activity of smokers' or non-smokers' urine incubated with or without bacteria for 72 hr at 37 degrees C was assayed by the Ames Salmonella/microsome test (using TA100 or TA98 with S9-mix). The mutagenic activity increased in urine incubated with the nitrate-reducing S. marcescens or P. aeruginosa, compared to controls which were incubated without bacteria. Potent mutagenic activity could be induced when the urine concentrate prepared from smokers' urine with an XAD-2 resin column was incubated with sodium nitrite (40 mM) at pH 3 for 4 hrs. The potent mutagenic activity observed here seems to be due to the class of direct-acting mutagen(s), because no metabolic activation was required. The mutagen formation at an optimal pH 4 proceeded rapidly during 4 hrs of incubation, but decreased thereafter. It was noted that even at a physiological pH 6 of human urine, a lower but significant level of mutagenic activity could still be detected. The mutagenic activity of individual urine concentrate from 14 male smokers and from 6 male non-smokers was assayed after 30 min of incubation with or without sodium nitrite (40 mM) at pH 6. Mutagenic activity increased in most of these urine concentrates incubated with sodium nitrite. The levels were variable between individuals with a 1.3- to 53-fold increase compared with the controls incubated without sodium nitrite.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Interpretive criteria and quality control for antimicrobial susceptibility tests  of levofloxacin.
AB  - To confirm preliminary interpretive breakpoints for prototype 5 micrograms levofloxacin disks, 490 strains were tested in vitro using commercially manufactured disks. For in vitro susceptibility testing, 5 micrograms levofloxacin disks can be used with interpretive criteria of < or = 12 mm for resistant (MIC > or = 8.0 micrograms/ml) and > or = 16 mm for susceptible (MIC < or = 2.0 micrograms/ml). Proposed quality control limits for tests of levofloxacin are as follows: Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, zones 29-37 mm or MIC 0.008-0.03 microgram/ml; Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, zones 19-26 mm or MIC 0.5-2.0 micrograms/ml; Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, zones 24-31 mm; Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213, MIC 0.06-0.25 microgram/ml and Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, MIC 0.25-2.0 micrograms/ml.
TI  - Evidence for direct-acting oxidative genotoxicity by reduction products of azo dyes.
AB  - The intestinal flora forms a complex ecosystem that metabolizes dietary and endogenous nutrients under primarily anaerobic conditions. The ingestion of azo dyes has been proposed as one source of potential genotoxic agents. Many intestinal bacteria are able to reduce the azo bond (termed azofission), which liberates the substituted naphthol compounds. The standard Ames test has not demonstrated mutagenicity either by various common food colorings or by their reduced end products in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98 and TA100. In contrast, genetic toxicity was demonstrated in the Escherichia coli differential kill assay and in S. typhimurium TA102 for the reduced dyes. The superoxide free radical was produced by the azo dyes only after reduction by the intestinal bacteria Enterococcus faecalis and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron.
TI  - Glycopeptide resistance mediated by enterococcal transposon Tn1546 requires production of VanX for hydrolysis of D-alanyl-D-alanine.
AB  - Cloning and nucleotide sequencing indicated that transposon Tn1546 from Enterococcus faecium BM4147 encodes a 23,365 Da protein, VanX, required for glycopeptide resistance. The vanX gene was located downstream from genes encoding the VanA ligase and the VanH dehydrogenase which synthesize the depsipeptide D-alanyl-D-lactate (D-Ala-D-Lac). In the presence of ramoplanin, an Enterococcus faecalis JH2-2 derivative producing VanH, VanA and VanX accumulated mainly UDP-MurNAc-L-Ala-gamma-D-Glu-L-Lys-D-Ala-D-Lac (pentadepsipeptide) and small amounts of UDP-MurNAc-L-Ala-gamma-D-Glu-L-Lys-D-Ala-D-Ala (pentapeptide) in the ratio 49:1. Insertional inactivation of vanX led to increased synthesis of pentapeptide with a resulting change in the ratio of pentadepsipeptide: pentapeptide to less than 1:1. Expression of vanX in E. faecalis and Escherichia coli resulted in production of a D,D-dipeptidase that hydrolysed D-Ala-D-Ala. Pentadepsipeptide, pentapeptide and D-Ala-D-Lac were not substrates for the enzyme. These results establish that VanX is required for production of a D,D-dipeptidase that hydrolyses D-Ala-D-Ala, thereby preventing pentapeptide synthesis and subsequent binding of glycopeptides to D-Ala-D-Ala-containing peptidoglycan precursors at the cell surface.
TI  - Analysis by PCR and direct DNA sequencing of gyrA mutations associated with fluoroquinolone resistance in Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - A region of gyrA, the gene encoding subunit A of DNA gyrase, that is known to be  associated with resistance was amplified and sequenced from 16 Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium isolates. Six ciprofloxacin-resistant clinical isolates (MICs of ciprofloxacin, 32 to 64 micrograms/ml) and one multistep resistant laboratory mutant of E. faecalis (MIC of ciprofloxacin, 128 micrograms/ml) contained a change from serine to arginine or to isoleucine at codon 83 or a change from glutamic acid to lysine or to glycine at codon 87 (Escherichia coli GyrA coordinates); these changes have been associated with fluoroquinolone resistance in other species. No difference in the region studied was found in two ciprofloxacin-resistant E. faecium isolates (MICs, 32 micrograms/ml) or in four laboratory derived, spontaneous ciprofloxacin-resistant mutants of E. faecalis (MICs, 8 to 16 micrograms/ml), suggesting that other mechanisms may be responsible for fluoroquinolone resistance in some enterococci.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity and beta-lactamase stability of SY5555, a new oral penem antibiotic.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of SY5555, a new oral penem antibiotic, was compared with those of cefaclor, cefixime, and cefteram. SY5555 was more active than the comparison agents against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Morganella morganii, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Clostridium spp., and Bacteroides fragilis. Against Providencia spp., Proteus spp., and Haemophilus influenzae, SY5555 was less active than cefixime or cefteram. SY5555 was inactive against methicillin-resistant S. aureus. Enterococcus faecium, Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Xanthomonas maltophilia, as were the comparison agents. The bactericidal activities of SY5555, cefixime, and cefteram were at or slightly greater than the MICs for clinical isolates of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. SY5555 was not hydrolyzed by various types of beta-lactamases. However, SY5555 and the comparison agents were hydrolyzed by X. maltophilia (L-1) and P. aeruginosa/pMS354 beta-lactamases, two Bush group 3 beta-lactamases, SY5555 showed a high affinity, as did cefixime and cefteram, for cephalosporinases from C. freundii GN7391 and E. cloacae GN7471 strains. These results suggest that SY5555 may be more specific than existing beta-lactam antibiotics.
TI  - Molecular cloning and sequence analysis of the gene encoding the H2O2-forming NADH oxidase from Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Streptococcus mutans induces both H2O2-forming and H2O-forming NADH oxidases in the presence of O2 [M. Higuchi, J. Gen. Microbiol., 130, 1819-1826 (1984)]. In this paper, a nox-1 gene encoding H2O2-forming NADH oxidase (NOX-1) from Streptococcus mutans was cloned, and the nucleotides sequenced. The structural gene of nox-1 consisted of 1530 base pairs, which encode a polypeptide consisting of 510 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 55,196 Da. The deduced N-terminal amino acid sequence was consistent with that previously found for the purified NOX-1 protein. The nox-1 gene was expressed in Escherichia coli using its own promoter. Alignment of the amino acid sequence of NOX-1 with those of NADH oxidases from other microorganisms showed identities of 55.6%, 20.8%, 20.3%, and 7.3% for those of Amphibacillus xylanus Ep01, Streptococcus faecalis 10C1, Thermoanaerobium brockii Rt8.G4, and Thermus thermophilus HB8, respectively.
TI  - Survival, physiological response and recovery of enteric bacteria exposed to a polar marine environment.
AB  - Survival, sublethal injury, and recoverability of Escherichia coli, Enterococcus  faecalis, Salmonella typhimurium, and Yersinia enterocolitica were investigated by using diffusion chambers over 54 to 56 days of in situ exposure to a polar marine environment (-1.8 degrees C; salinity, 34.5 ppt) at McMurdo Station, Antarctica. Plate counts were used to assess recoverability and injury, whereas direct viable counts (DVCs) and 5-cyano-2,3-ditolyl tetrazolium chloride (CTC) reduction were utilized to determine substrate responsiveness and respiratory activity, respectively. T90 values (times for 10-fold decreases in numbers of recoverable cells) on nonselective medium were ca. 216 to 259 h for E. coli, S. typhimurium, and Y. enterocolitica and 432 h for E. faecalis. Sublethal injury was greater in populations of indicator bacteria than in pathogens. DVCs, CTC reduction, and plate counts indicated progressive increases in viable but nonculturable cells in E. coli, S. typhimurium, and Y. enterocolitica cultures throughout the 54-day exposure. Forty-eight-day exposure of E. coli, S. typhimurium, and Y. enterocolitica resulted in decreased optimal incubation temperatures for colony formation and inability to form colonies at 37 degrees C. The detection of responsive E. coli, S. typhimurium, and Y. enterocolitica by the DVC and CTC methods remained within 1% of inoculum values during 54 days of exposure, indicating some long-term persistence in the viable-but-nonculturable state. Percentages of respiring E. coli and S. typhimurium increased significantly upon addition of nutrients at all temperatures tested, indicating that nutrient availability rather than temperature limited enteric bacterial activity in this very cold environment. Large nutrient inputs to low-temperature marine environments may thus allow for the long-term persistence of enteric bacteria in a nonrecoverable state.
TI  - Analysis of genes encoding D-alanine-D-alanine ligase-related enzymes in Enterococcus casseliflavus and Enterococcus flavescens.
AB  - Using degenerate oligonucleotides complementary to sequences encoding conserved amino acid motifs in D-alanine-D-alanine (Ddl) ligases, we have amplified ca. 600-bp fragments from Enterococcus casseliflavus ATCC 25788 and Enterococcus flavescens CCM439. Sequence analysis of the amplification products indicated that each strain possessed two genes, ddlE. cass. and vanC-2, and ddlE. flav. and vanC-3, respectively, encoding Ddl-related enzymes. The fragments internal to the vanC genes were 98.3% identical. The vanC-2 gene was cloned into Escherichia coli and sequenced. Extensive similarity (66% nucleotide identity) was detected between this gene and vanC-1 from Enterococcus gallinarum (S. Dutka-Malen, C. Molinas, M. Arthur, and P. Courvalin, Gene 112:53-58, 1992), suggesting that the vanC genes are required for intrinsic low-level resistance to vancomycin. The partial deduced amino acid sequences of ddlE. cass. and ddlE. flav. were identical and closely related to that of the Ddl ligase of Enterococcus faecalis (79% identity). In Southern hybridization experiments, only DNA from E. casseliflavus and E. flavescens hybridized to probes internal to the vanC-2 and ddlE. cass. genes.
TI  - In vitro activity of CP-99,219, a novel 7-(3-azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexyl) naphthyridone antimicrobial.
AB  - The in vitro activity of CP-99,219 was compared with that of ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against 814 clinical bacterial isolates using a microdilution method with brain-heart infusion broth. CP-99,219 was the most potent agent tested against methicillin-resistant, ciprofloxacin-susceptible staphylocci (minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC]90 < or = 0.25 microgram/ml). CP-99,219 was 32-fold and fourfold more potent than ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin, respectively, against Streptococcus pneumoniae, including strains resistant to penicillin G and erythromycin (MIC90 < or = 0.25 microgram/ml). CP-99,219 was also the most potent agent tested against S. pyogenes and Enterococcus faecalis (MIC90 < or = 0.5 microgram/ml). The activity of CP-99,219 against Enterobacteriaceae was comparable to that of sparfloxacin, with 90% of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter freundii, C. diversus, Helicobacter pylori, and K. oxytoca being inhibited by < or = 0.5 microgram/ml. Serratia marcescens, Morganella morganii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were less susceptible, with MIC90 values to CP-99,219 of 4, 2, and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. The MIC90 for Bacteroides fragilis was 0.39 microgram/ml for CP-99,219 compared with 12.5 micrograms/ml for ciprofloxacin. CP-99,219 was highly bactericidal at 1 x to 4 x MIC against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms; its activity was similar in nutrient, trypticase soy, and cation-supplemented Mueller-Hinton broths. The spectrum and potency observed with CP-99,219 warrant further testing with this novel quinolone.
TI  - Gas gangrene following sacral pressure sores.
AB  - We report two cases of gas gangrene developed from sacral pressure sores. The first case was clostridial and the second, non-clostridial gas gangrene. Both patients died within two months. The first patient, a 56-year-old woman suffering from palsy of the lower half of the body for 3 weeks, developed a sacral pressure sore. One month later, crepitus by palpation and gas formation in the X-ray film were detected in the hip and right thigh. A culture of odoriferous pus yielded Clostridium limosum in addition to Staphylococcus intermedius, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Bacteroides fragilis. Blood culture yielded Bacteroides fragilis. The patient died 50 days after admission in spite of surgical debridement and aggressive therapy with high doses of antibiotics and hyperbaric oxygen. The second patient, a 70-year-old man suffering from diabetic nephropathy, arteriosclerosis obliterans of the lower limbs, and cerebral infarction, developed a large decubitus ulcer covering the whole sacral area. Crepitus and gas were detected in the soft tissue of the left gluteal region. Almost the entire gluteus maximus muscle was necrotic. Bacteroides fragilis, methicillin-resistant or -sensitive Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli were isolated from the muscle. Bacteroides fragilis was also obtained by blood culture. The patient died on the 72nd day after admission.
TI  - In-vitro activity of four new fluoroquinolones.
AB  - The in-vitro activities of four new fluoroquinolones, E-4749, E-4874, E-4884 and  E-4904, were compared with that of ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against 1106 clinical isolates. Against majority of Enterobacteriaceae, general antibacterial activities of E-4749 (MIC90s 0.06-1 mg/L), E-4874 (MIC90s, 0.03-0.25 mg/L) and E-4884 (MIC90s 0.01-0.5 mg/L) were comparable or slightly lower than those of ciproloxacin (MIC90s 0.01-0.25 mg/L) and sparfloxacin (MIC90s 0.01-1 mg/L). The activity of E-4904 (MIC90s 0.06-2 mg/L) was lower than those of its analogues. Most of the Escherichia coli which were resistant to ciprofloxacin (MIC > or = 2 mg/L) and Serratia spp., were resistant to the new fluoroquinolones. beta-Lactamase producing strains of Moraxella catarrhalis were very susceptible to these compounds (MICs < or = 0.008 mg/L). Most of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, non-aeruginosa Pseudomonas spp., Xanthomonas maltophilia, and Acinetobacter spp. were resistant to the new quinolones (MIC90s 8- > 16 mg/L). On the contrary, these new antimicrobials were active against the majority of the Aeromonas spp. (MIC90s < or = 0.5 mg/L). E-4749, E-4874, E-4884 and E-4904 remained active (MIC90s < or = 0.25 mg/L) against Staphylococcus aureus strains susceptible to methicillin. However, its activity was two- to eight-fold lower than that of ciprofloxacin (MIC90 0.03 mg/L) and sparfloxacin (MIC90 0.06 mg/L). Against S. aureus resistant to methicillin or ciprofloxacin, activity of these new compounds and comparators agents, was very low (MIC90s 2- > 16 mg/L). Most of the strains of Enterococcus faecalis were resistant (MIC90s > 16 mg/L). The activity of E-4874, E-4904 and sparfloxacin (MIC90 1 mg/L for each one) was higher than that of the rest of the agents tested. E-4874 (MIC90 0.25 mg/L) was four-fold more active than the other antibacterials tested (MIC90 2 mg/L) against Listeria monocytogenes. No new quinolone was active against Bacteroides fragilis (MIC90s 4-16 mg/L), Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (MIC90s 8- > 16 mg/L), and other B. fragilis group (MIC90s 16- > 16 mg/L). Ciprofloxacin (MIC90s > 16 mg/L), and sparfloxacin (MIC90s 8-16 mg/L) also were inactive. E-4874 (MIC90 4 mg/L) was the most active quinolone tested against B.fragilis.
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of a new carbapenem antibiotic, biapenem (L-627), in the pediatric field].
AB  - Biapenem (L-627) was evaluated for its safety and efficacy in 27 children with various bacterial infections. L-627 was effective in cases with osteomyelitis due to Staphylococcus aureus, pneumonia and purulent meningitis due to penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, and urinary tract infections due to Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. However, L-627 failed to produce good responses in 2 of 7 cases of Haemophilus influenzae infections. Pharmacokinetic parameters of 30-minutes infusion of 12 mg/kg were as follows: Cmax 29-46 micrograms/ml, T 1/2 0.68-0.94 hr. Adverse reactions were minimal. These data suggest that L-627 is safe in children, and is valuable especially for treatment of infections in immunocompromised hosts and infections due to multiply resistant bacteria.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of sucralfate.
AB  - The effect of sucralfate (12.5 mg/ml) on the growth of Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29212) and two isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853 and a multi-resistant clinical isolate) was studied in vitro at pH values of 3.0, 4.5, 6.0 and 7.4. A bacteriostatic effect of sucralfate was demonstrated for Pseudomonas aeruginosa at a pH of 6.0 and 7.4 and for Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis at a pH of 6.0. The bacteriostatic effect was most pronounced at high pH values. Sucralfate had no bactericidal effect on the bacteria tested at the concentration used.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of ciprofloxacin in the urine during four days after a single 500 mg and 750 mg oral dose].
AB  - Antibacterial activity of ciprofloxacin was studied in the urine after a single 500 mg and 750 mg oral dose in ten healthy female volunteers. Urine was collected, after each single oral dose, during seven time periods: 0-3 h, 3-6 h, 6-12 h, 12-24 h, 24-48 h, 48-72 h, 72-96 h. Ciprofloxacin concentrations were assayed by microbiological method. Urine antibacterial activity was determined for five bacterial strains isolated in urine: 2 E. coli strains, one sensitive and the other resistant to nalidixic acid (Nal-A), 1 Klebsiella pneumoniae resistant to nalidixic acid (Nal-B), 1 Staphylococcus saprophyticus and 1 Enterococcus faecalis. MICs of ciprofloxacin against these strains were respectively 0.003, 0.06, 0.25, 0.06 and 0.5 micrograms/ml. Ciprofloxacin mean concentrations in the seven urine samples were 292.5 +/- 55.8, 81.1 +/- 16.9, 43.7 +/- 11.6, 11.5 +/- 1.9, 1.3 +/- 0.2, 0.3 +/- 0.05 et 0.1 +/- 0.05 micrograms/ml after a single 500 mg oral dose and 215.1 +/- 68.1, 56.1 +/- 17.8, 43 +/- 8.8, 14.4 +/- 5.5, 1.4 +/- 0.2, 0.4 +/- 0.1 and 0.2 +/- 0.05 micrograms/ml after a single 750 mg oral dose. Urine bacteriostatic activity was not very different after a 500 mg dose and a 750 mg dose. Against enterobacteriacae, after a 500 mg dose it was > or = 16 the first day; it was > or = 512 for the Nal-S E. coli. It was > or = 64 the first day, and remained between 2 and 32 the second day for the Nal-R strains (E. coli and Klebsiella).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Bacterial translocation in cultured enterocytes: magnitude, specificity, and electron microscopic observations of endocytosis.
AB  - Previous in vivo evidence has shown that bacterial phagocytosis by enterocytes may be an initial step in bacterial translocation across the intestinal epithelium. This study analyzed the interactions of cultured enterocytes, namely Caco-2 cells, with nine strains of enteric bacteria, tested in pure culture and in mixed culture. These nine strains had a spectrum of invasive potential and included Salmonella typhimurium, Listeria monocytogenes (three strains), Escherichia coli (three strains), Proteus mirabilis, and Enterococcus faecalis. Numbers of viable intracellular bacteria recovered from Caco-2 cells were: L. monocytogenes > S. typhimurium > P. mirabilis > E. coli > E. faecalis. Uptake of a given microbe by enterocytes was strain-specific and was not influenced by the presence of another strain, regardless of the invasive ability of the coinfecting strain. Electron microscopic visualization of bacterial adherence and uptake by Caco-2 cells indicated that the epithelial interactions of normal enteric bacteria were similar to these observed with invasive strains of salmonella and listeria.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of FK037, a new parenteral broad-spectrum cephalosporin, against recent clinical isolates in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of a new parenteral cephalosporin, FK037 was assessed  against recent aerobic and anaerobic strains isolated from patients in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology during the period between January 1992 and June 1993. The MICs of FK037 for 90% of the clinical isolates tested were 0.10 microgram/ml for Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, 0.20 microgram/ml for Streptococcus agalactiae, 0.39 microgram/ml for Gardnerella vaginalis, 0.78 microgram/ml for Staphylococcus epidermidis, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Mobiluncus spp., 1.56 micrograms/ml for Peptostreptococcus magnus, 3.13 micrograms/ml for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, 25 micrograms/ml for methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Bacteroides fragilis and Prevotella disiens, 100 micrograms/ml for Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and Prevotella bivia; and > 100 micrograms/ml for Enterococcus faecalis. FK037 was superior in potency to ceftazidime against all strains except E. faecalis, P. anaerobius and P. bivia. It was 4- to 16-fold more active than cefotaxime against aerobic gram-positive bacteria and P. disiens, and its activity was similar to that of cefotaxime against the other strains. FK037 had 4- to 16-fold stronger activity than flomoxef against MRSA, S. agalactiae and E. coli and a similar activity to flomoxef against the other strains except G. vaginalis and B. fragilis that were 4-fold more sensitive to flomoxef than to FK037.
TI  - Hydrophobic bile salt inhibits bacterial adhesion on biliary stent material.
AB  - Blockage of indwelling biliary stents is caused by biliary sludge, which forms as a result of bacteria adhering to the surface of the stent material and forming adherent biofilm. As the adherence of bacteria on plastic surface involves hydrophobic interaction of the plastic polymer and the bacterial cell wall, we tested if the detergent property of bile salts might retard bacterial adherence. Three common biliary pathogens isolated from the bile of patients suffering from acute suppurative cholangitis were used in this experiment: E. coli (O21:H25) which form pili and a glycocalyx; E. coli (O101:H9), non-piliated but with a glycocalyx, and Enterococcus fecalis without either pili or a glycocalyx. Polyethylene disks (1 cm2 diameter) were used for the in vitro adhesion study. They were continuously perfused by the bacterial suspension, flowing at 50 ml/hr at 37 degrees C for 24 hr. The suspending media used were sterile human bile and tryptic soy broth. Two different bile salts, taurocholate and taurodeoxycholate, were added to the perfusion media. The number of bacteria adhering to the surface was assessed by viable bacterial count, epifluorescence microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy. The results showed that E. coli (O21:H25) exhibited better adherence than the nonpiliated E. coli (O101:H9), which in turn was better than the non-pili-, non-glycocalyx-producing Enterococcus fecalis. When a more hydrophobic bile salt, taurodeoxycholate, was added at 25 or 50 mM to the tryptic soy broth or to the human bile, the adherence of the two E. coli strains were reduced 100- to 1000-fold (P < 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Contaminated rabbit patellar tendon grafts. In vivo analysis of disinfecting methods.
AB  - In Part 1 of our study, 40 central-third bone-patellar tendon-bone grafts were harvested from 20 adult California White rabbits under strict sterile conditions. Ten grafts were placed directly into a thioglycolate broth, incubated, and subcultured; no growth was noted in any specimen. The next 6 grafts were contaminated 20 seconds each with 2 different species of coagulase-negative staphylococci. Organisms were grown with cultures obtained from an operating room floor during anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. Marked growth of both species was noted in all 6 grafts within 24 hours. A subsequent 3 series of 8 grafts each were harvested sterilely, contaminated as described above, and soaked in 1 of 3 solutions 30 minutes before culture. Both 10% povidone-iodine and a triple-antibiotic solution (gentamicin, clindamycin, polymyxin) were 100% ineffective as both organisms grew; 4% chlorhexidine gluconate effectively decontaminated 8 grafts in all cases. Part 2 involved contamination of harvested grafts with 5 common, virulent organisms: Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterococcus faecalis. Elimination of all except Klebsiella pneumoniae was successful with 4% chlorhexidine gluconate alone for 8 grafts. Using a triple-antibiotic solution after chlorhexidine gluconate in 6 grafts eliminated this organism also.
TI  - Minimum inhibitory concentration quality-control guidelines for biapenem, DU-6859a, FK-037, levofloxacin, grepafloxacin, and ceftizoxime when using various National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards susceptibility test methods. Quality Control Study Group.
AB  - Several multilaboratory collaborative studies using broth microdilution and agar  dilution (gonococcal tests only) methods of susceptibility testing were performed to establish quality-control (QC) giudelines. Replicate dilution tests with multiple lots of media were performed with National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards recommended QC strains (Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213) by using the following antimicrobials: biapenem, DU-6859a, FK-037, levofloxacin, and grepafloxacin. In addition QC MIC ranges, using appropriate medium modification for Haemophilus influenzae ATCC 49247 and Neisseria gonorrhoeae ATCC 49226 were reported on four (DU-6859a, FK-037, levofloxacin, and grepafloxacin) and two (ceftizoxime and FK-037) antimicrobials, respectively.
TI  - Structural comparison of the histidine-containing phosphocarrier protein HPr.
AB  - The phosphocarrier protein HPr is a central component of the bacterial phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS) that is responsible for carbohydrate uptake in many bacterial species. A number of three-dimensional structures of HPrs from both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria have been determined; the overall folding topology of HPr is an open-faced beta-sandwich composed of three alpha-helices and a beta-sheet. A detailed structural comparison of these HPrs has been carried out. Besides the overall main chain folding, many detailed structural features are well conserved in all HPr structures. The three x-ray structures of HPrs from Escherichia coli, Streptococcus faecalis, and Bacillus subtilis show considerable overall similarity with respect to the positions of the C alpha atoms. A significant structural difference between HPrs from Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria is found in the region of Gly54, owing to the steric effects of Tyr37 in HPrs from the Gram-positive species. The region around Gly54 is involved in the binding of HPr to other PTS proteins and the differences in this region may be responsible for some of the poor functional complementation between HPrs from Gram-positive and Gram-negative species. The active center region, residues 12-18, appears to have significant differences in the comparisons between the overall structures. These differences support the proposal that phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of the active site His15 is accompanied by conformational changes. However, a local structural comparison of residues 12-18 from the x-ray structures of HPrs from E. coli and B. subtilis, and the two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance structure of B. subtilis HPr suggests that there is a conserved active center involving residues His15, Arg 17, and Pro18, which shows little conformational change during the phosphorylation cycle. The results of other experimental approaches, including site-directed mutagenesis and NMR spectroscopy, are in some cases difficult to rationalize with some of the details of the structures, but do appear to favour the conclusion that little conformational change occurs.
TI  - Molecular requirements for the inhibition of the tetracycline antiport protein and the effect of potent inhibitors on the growth of tetracycline-resistant bacteria.
AB  - Forty-seven compounds and tetracycline (Tc) structural analogues were tested for  their ability to interfere with [3H]Tc uptake in everted inner membrane vesicles derived from Tc-resistant Escherichia coli D1-209, bearing the class B tetracycline resistance efflux protein (Tet protein). For effective inhibition of Tc uptake, the molecule had to have an intact ABCD tetracyclic carbon skeleton and a conjugated phenolic beta-diketone substructure at positions 10-12a with the subsequent development of keto-enol tautomerization. Molecular variations at carbon positions 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 did not decrease, and some increased, the inhibitory activity as compared to that of Tc. Among these compounds, the highest inhibition of uptake occurred with certain position 6 and 13 derivatives of 5-hydroxytetracycline. In a group of 13-(propylthio) derivatives of 5-OH-Tc [13-propyl, 13-(3-chloropropyl), and 13-(2-carboxyethyl)] there was a correlation between uptake inhibitory activity and antibacterial activity. The 13-(3-chloropropyl) derivative, with the best efflux inhibitory activity, exhibited synergistic activity when tested in combination with doxycycline against Tc-resistant E. coli bearing the class A or B determinant, against Staphylococcus aureus bearing class K, and against Enterococcus faecalis bearing the class L determinant. The 13-propyl analogue also showed high transport blocking activity and showed synergistic antibacterial activity against E. coli bearing the class A determinant and additive activity against the other Tc-resistant bacteria. The synergistic antibacterial activity of these compounds was not shown by the 13-[(2-carboxyethyl)thio] homologue, whose efflux blocking activity was 70-fold less. These findings suggest that multiple sites on the Tc molecule are available for synthetic modification toward the development of an effective Tc blocking agent. Such compounds, used alone or in combination with a standard tetracycline, show improved antibacterial activity.

AB  
TI  - Conjugative transposition: Tn916 integrase contains two independent DNA binding domains that recognize different DNA sequences.
AB  - Transposition of the conjugative transposon Tn916 requires the activity of a protein, called Int, which is related to members of the integrase family of site-specific recombinases. This family includes phage lambda integrase as well as the Cre, FLP and XerC/XerD recombinases. Different proteins, consisting of fragments of Tn916 Int protein fused to the C-terminal end of maltose binding protein (MBP) were purified from Escherichia coli. DNase I protection experiments showed that MBP-INT proteins containing the C-terminal end of Int bound to the ends of the transposon and adjacent plasmid DNA. MBP-INT proteins containing the N-terminal end of Int bound to sequences within the transposon close to each end. Competition binding experiments showed that the sites recognized by the C- and N-terminal regions of Int did not compete with each other for binding to MBP-INT. We suggest that Tn916 and related conjugative transposons are unique among members of the integrase family of site-specific recombination systems because the presence of two DNA binding domains in the Int protein might allow Int to bridge recombining sites, and this bridging seems to be the sole mechanism ensuring that only correctly aligned molecules undergo recombination.
TI  - Investigation of the potential role of Enterococcus faecalis in the pathophysiology of experimental peritonitis.
AB  - Two nonfatal models of peritonitis differing by the duration and the severity of  the disease were studied in rats by implantation of Escherichia coli and Bacteroides fragilis with or without increasing concentrations of Enterococcus faecalis. Results were evaluated at 3 or 6 days after inoculation. The highest enterococcal concentrations (10(9) cfu/mL) enhanced the severity of the infection, evident by increased emaciation, increased peritoneal counts of E. coli and B. fragilis, and increased frequency of E. coli and B. fragilis bacteremia compared with enterococcus-free animals. Six therapeutic regimens (low-dose amoxicillin + low-dose gentamicin, high-dose amoxicillin + high-dose gentamicin, pefloxacin, ornidazole, pefloxacin + ornidazole, imipenem + gentamicin) were tested. All treatments failed to eradicate E. faecalis except the combination pefloxacin + ornidazole, which achieved a significant reduction of local bacterial counts and suppressed bacteremia. Enterococcus played an important role in the mechanisms of bacterial synergy in experimental peritonitis. However, eradication of enterococcus did not seem possible by conventional antienterococcal therapy.
TI  - Sequence of the vanB and ddl genes encoding D-alanine:D-lactate and D-alanine:D-alanine ligases in vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis V583.
AB  - A pair of degenerate oligodeoxyribonucleotides was used to amplify, by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), DNA fragments internal to genes encoding D-Ala:D-Ala ligase-related proteins of vancomycin-resistant (VmR) Enterococcus faecalis V583. Cloning and nucleotide sequencing of the PCR products indicated that fragments of two genes, designated vanB and ddl, were co-amplified. The vanB gene was previously shown to be present in Enterococcus strains expressing VanB-type VmR [Quintiliani Jr. et al., J. Infect. Dis. 8 (1993) 943-950]. The ddl gene was detected by Southern hybridization in all VmR and VmS strains of En. faecalis, but not in representatives of 17 other species of Enterococcus. The vanB and ddl genes were cloned in bacteriophage lambda and sequenced. There was extensive similarity (76% amino-acid identity) between the product of vanB and the VmR protein, VanA. The product of ddl, the D-Ala:D-Ala ligases, DdlA and DdlB, of Escherichia coli and the resistance proteins, VanA and VanB, were more distantly related (32-40% aa identity). After induction of VmR, En. faecalis V583 synthesized the cell wall precursor, UDP-N-acetylmuramyl-tetrapeptide-D-lactate, indicating that the mechanism of glycopeptide resistance in strains with the VanA and VanB phenotype is similar.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of AM-1155, a novel 6-fluoro-8-methoxy quinolone.
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activity of AM-1155 against a wide variety of clinical isolates was compared with those of other fluoroquinolones. The MICs of AM-1155 for 90% of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Enterococcus faecalis isolates tested were 0.10, 0.39, and 0.78 microgram/ml, respectively. The antibacterial activity of AM-1155 against gram-positive bacteria and anaerobes was comparable to those of sparfloxacin and tosufloxacin. AM-1155 inhibited 90% of most species of the family Enterobacteriaceae at a concentration of 0.39 microgram/ml. AM-1155 generally had activity comparable to that of sparfloxacin against gram-negative bacteria. AM-1155 showed moderate activity against methicillin- and quinolone-resistant S. aureus. AM-1155 demonstrated bactericidal activity at the MIC. The frequency of occurrence of spontaneous mutants resistant to four times the MIC of AM-1155 was < 1 x 10(9) for S. aureus, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. AM-1155 strongly inhibited the supercoiling activities of DNA gyrases purified from E. coli and S. aureus.
TI  - [Nationwide survey on susceptibilities of clinical isolates from urinary tract to antimicrobial agents in Japan, 1991].
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of urinary tract isolates to antimicrobial agents examined at 123 hospital laboratories in Japan from September to December in 1991. In this study, identification and susceptibility testing were carried out at each laboratory. The susceptibility testing was performed according to the disk diffusion method recommended by National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards. MRSA showed high resistance rates to all agents tested except to minocycline (MINO). MSSA had good susceptibility to imipenem (IPM) and cephalosporins with susceptibility rates higher than 90%. Enterococcus faecalis was susceptible to IPM, ampicillin and piperacillin (PIPC) and highly resistant to cephalosporins, gentamicin (GM), erythromycin, clindamycin and MINO. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis were susceptible to beta-lactam drugs, GM and ofloxacin (OFLX). High susceptibility rates were observed for strains of Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii to IPM, GM, and OFLX and of Serratia marcescens for IPM and GM. Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were highly susceptible to IPM, ceftazidime, AMK, cefsulodin, cefoperazone, PIPC in this order.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of tosufloxacin against fresh clinical isolates].
AB  - The antibacterial activity of tosufloxacin (TFLX) was compared with those of other new quinolones (ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, sparfloxacin and fleroxacin) against clinical isolates. These isolates had been collected from May to June 1993 (22 species, 260 strains) and from June to July 1992 (Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 87 strains) in Toyama municipal hospital. TFLX showed the most potent activities against methicillin-susceptible S. aureus, methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli in 1993, at MIC50 levels. The MIC50's of TFLX for these species ranged from 0.025 to 0.39 microgram/ml. TFLX showed potent activities against Klebsiella pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa, and the MIC50's of TFLX were 0.05 and 0.39 microgram/ml, respectively. However, new quinolone resistant strains (MIC > or = 6.25 micrograms/ml) were found among some species. Especially, the number of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains resistant to new quinolone exceeded 60% of all the S. aureus isolates in 1993. More MRSA strains resistant to new quinolones were isolated in 1993 than in 1992, and similar result was observed for P. aeruginosa. The coagulase typing was done, and all MRSA strains of resistant to new quinolones produced coagulase type II.
TI  - In vitro activity of cefdinir (FK482) and ten other antibiotics against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria isolated from adult and pediatric patients.
AB  - The in vitro activity of cefdinir, an oral aminothiazolyl hydroxyimino cephalosporin was compared with that of cefixime, cefpodoxime, cefaclor, cephalexin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, oxacillin, ampicillin, vancomycin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole against 279 gram-positive and gram-negative recent clinical isolates from adult and pediatric patients. Cefdinir was the most active drug among the cephalosporins against oxacillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, Escherichia coli and Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC90 0.015-2 mg/l). Cefixime was the most active agent against Hemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis and P. vulgaris (MIC90 < 0.015-0.125 mg/l). The activity of cefpodoxime was better than that of cefixime against S. pneumoniae and oxacillin-sensitive staphylococci (MIC90 0.25-8 vs. 0.5-32 mg/l), similar to cefixime against S. pyogenes (MIC90 0.06 mg/l) and not as good as cefixime against H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, Klebsiella spp. and Proteus spp. (MIC90 < 0.015-0.25 vs. 0.125-0.5 mg/l). The activity of cefdinir was greater than that of the other cephalosporins against Enterococcus faecalis (MIC90 16-32 vs. > 64 mg/l). None of the cephalosporins were active against methicillin-resistant, coagulase-positive or -negative staphylococci or Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90 > 64 mg/l). Overall, the susceptibilities of adult and pediatric isolates were similar. Kinetic kill curves demonstrated rapid and similar killing at 6 h by cefdinir, cefixime, cefpodoxime and ofloxacin. At 24 h at 1 x MIC, the least regrowth was observed with cefdinir and cefpodoxime; at 2 x MIC, suppression of growth was similar with all four drugs.
TI  - Bactericidal properties of crude extracts of Mitracarpus villosus.
AB  - Mature leaves and inflorescence of Mitracarpus villosus, collected from Niger State, Nigeria, were shade dried over a period of 5 days, ground into fine particles in a Waring blender and extracted individually with hot distilled water and 95% ethanol. The crude extracts obtained were tested for their in vitro antibacterial activities using agar diffusion and tube dilution techniques. The extracts produced zones of inhibition (8-23 mm) against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis and Streptococcus faecalis, while Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis were not inhibited. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of the effective extracts were in the range 0.06-8.0 mg/ml, while the minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBC) were in the range 0.06-32.0 mg/ml. The ethanolic extracts appeared to exert more inhibitory action against the bacteria than the hot water extracts.
TI  - Characterization of the determinant (traB) encoding sex pheromone shutdown by the hemolysin/bacteriocin plasmid pAD1 in Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - pAD1 is a hemolysin/bacteriocin plasmid originally identified in Enterococcus faecalis DS16. It encodes a mating response to a peptide sex pheromone, cAD1, secreted by recipient bacteria. Once pAD1 is acquired, production of the pheromone ceases--a trait related in part to a determinant designated traB. Here we report the nucleotide sequence of traB and the position of several transposon insertions resulting in the characteristic self-induction phenotype. The deduced product has a mass of 43.7 kDa with the C-terminal third consisting primarily of hydrophobic amino acid residues.
TI  - Cloning and sequencing of sakP encoding sakacin P, the bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus sake LTH 673.
AB  - Sakacin P is a heat-stable, unmodified peptide bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus sake LTH 673. The strain was isolated from fermented dry sausages and is well adapted to this habitat. The bacteriocin inhibits the growth of the opportunistic food pathogens Enterococcus faecalis and Listeria monocytogenes and therefore, it may improve the hygienic status of fermented food, i.e. meat products. Oligonucleotide probes were designed from the N-terminal amino acid sequence of sakacin P and used to identify sakP, the structural gene of sakacin P, on the chromosome of L. sake LTH 673. SakP was cloned into Escherichia coli NM554 and the nucleotide sequence of the gene and its adjacent regions were determined. Sakacin P appears to be synthesized as a prepeptide of 61 amino acids which is proteolytically processed to the mature bacteriocin consisting of 43 amino acids. Sequencing of the cloned fragment also revealed the presence of two other open reading frames orfX and orfY, which are located upstream and downstream of sakP, respectively, putatively encoding proteins of 52 and 98 amino acids, respectively. The functions of both ORFs remain unknown. Primer extension analysis revealed a promoter upstream of sakP. Two transcripts of approximately 0.35 and 1.0 kb were detected by Northern hybridization encoding either only sakP, or both sakP and orfY, respectively.

TI  - Survey of bacteraemia in a Spanish hospital over a decade (1981-1990).
AB  - The aetiology, epidemiology and in-vitro antibiotic susceptibility of bacteraemic isolates in a Spanish hospital, over a decade (1981-1990), were reviewed. A total of 4363 possible episodes were microbiologically confirmed (incidence: 15.7 cases per 1000 admissions). A slight increase in the number of Gram-positive cocci and anaerobes over the last 4 years was found. The most frequent species (annual range) were: Escherichia coli (13.5%-18.9%), Staphylococcus aureus (10.5%-17.8%), Klebsiella spp. (3.0%-9.4%), Enterococcus faecalis (3.0%-8.2%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2.5%-5.8%) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (1.8%-5.6%). Males were more affected than females (ratio 1.7:1). The portal of entry was known in 2126 episodes, of which the most frequent were urinary and gasto-intestinal tracts (24.4% and 19.4% respectively). Bacteraemia was associated with rapidly and ultimately fatal underlying diseases in 7.2% and 15.1% of the cases respectively. The hospital location of patients was: medical ward 46.0%, surgical ward 22.7%, paediatric ward 16.9%, and intensive care unit 14.4%.
TI  - Phagocytosis of urinary pathogens in persons with spinal cord injury.
AB  - Urinary tract infections (UTI) are a major source of morbidity in persons with spinal cord injury (SCI), often prolonging hospitalization, interfering with rehabilitation, and leading to secondary urologic complications. Greater understanding of host and bacterial factors that may predispose to invasive UTI and identification of persons at greatest risk for renal deterioration could facilitate development of measures to improve the quality of life for these individuals. A prospective investigation of host phagocyte-bacterial interactions was undertaken as a means to assess whether persons with SCI who develop renal deterioration may be deficient in this important means by which invasive bacteria are eliminated from tissues. Neutrophil phagocytic and serum opsonic activities against uropathogenic Escherichia coli and Enterococcus fecalis were studied in 17 persons with SCI who had diminished renal function and 25 persons with SCI who had normal renal function. Phagocytic and opsonic activities of neurologically intact persons were also comparatively studied as an additional control group. No differences in efficiency of opsonization or phagocytosis were detected when persons with SCI and impaired renal function were compared with persons with SCI who had normal renal function or neurologically intact controls. Whether biochemical characteristics of urine or other undefined local aspects of the urinary tract influence host-bacterial relationships and urologic outcome following SCI are topics worthy of future investigation.
TI  - Molecular characterization of a plasmid-borne (pGT633) erythromycin resistance determinant (ermGT) from Lactobacillus reuteri 100-63.
AB  - Lactobacillus reuteri 100-63 contains a 9.8 kb plasmid (pGT633) encoding resistance to the macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin (MLS) type B antibiotics. The restriction endonucleases AccI, BamHI, BclI, EcoRI, EcoRV, HhaI, HindII, HpaI, KpnI, SalI, and SspI were employed to establish a physical map of pGT633. Next, genetic transfer experiments were conducted to establish the host range of pGT633. The results revealed that pGT633 replicated autonomously and encoded constitutive resistance to erythromycin in a variety of bacterial hosts, including Bacillus subtilis BD170, Streptococcus sanguis DL1, Staphylococcus aureus RN4220, and Enterococcus faecalis 19433, as well as several Lactobacillus spp. A 2.2 kb BamHI fragment of pGT633 containing the genetic determinant (ermGT) encoding resistance to erythromycin was cloned into Escherichia coli. Determination of the nucleotide sequence of ermGT revealed a methylase gene 731 bp in length that was highly related (ca. 81% nucleotide and ca. 78% amino acid identity) to the ermC gene from S. aureus plasmid pE194. The leader sequences of ermGT and ermC were identical except for a single base change at nt 51.
TI  - The promiscuous plasmids pIP501 and pAM beta 1 from gram-positive bacteria encode complementary resolution functions.
AB  - pIP501 and pAM beta 1 are promiscuous plasmids from gram-positive bacteria which  carry structurally and genetically related replication functions (L. Janniere, A. Gruss and S.D. Ehrlich, 1993, in "Bacillus subtilis and Other Gram-positive Bacteria: Biochemistry, Physiology, and Molecular Genetics (A.L. Sonenshein, J.A. Hoch, and R. Losick, Eds.), pp. 625-644). We report here the sequence of a approximately 1 kb region located downstream of the pIP501 minimal replicon. This region is 82% homologous to the corresponding region of pAM beta 1 and encodes a resolution system which complements that of pAM beta 1. Additionally, we present evidence that the structural similarity between the two plasmids extends for further approximately 2 kb, through a region which may encode a topoisomerase protein in pAM beta 1.
TI  - Postantibiotic effect of DU-6859a and levofloxacin as compared with ofloxacin.
AB  - The postantibiotic effect (PAE) was determined for two of the newer fluoroquinolones: DU-6859a and levofloxacin. All drugs (including ofloxacin control) had good PAE activity against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. Only DU-6859a had PAE test conditions (< or = 0.5 mu/ml) that coincided with achievable clinical concentrations for all organisms tested. These data indicate that levofloxacin, like ofloxacin (PAEs, 1.0-2.9 h), could be administered once or twice daily and that the dosing of DU-6859a (PAEs, 1.6-2.4 h) might be extended to once every 24 h because of its documented PAE and its potency advantages as compared with levofloxacin and ofloxacin.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of cefdinir (FK482), a new oral cephalosporin with enhanced antistaphylococcal activity and beta-lactamase stability.
AB  - Cefdinir (FK482), a new oral cephalosporin with enhanced beta-lactamase stability, was tested by microbroth dilution against respiratory, urogenital, and skin and skin-structure bacterial pathogens. Included were beta-lactamase (beta LAC)-producing and -nonproducing isolates. Activity was compared with that of other orally administered beta-lactams. Cefdinir minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of isolates MIC90s (microgram/ml) were < or = 0.5 versus beta LAC+/oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus, aureus, S. epidermidis, and S. saprophyticus; < or = 0.06 versus Streptococcus groups A and B, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae beta LAC+; 0.125 versus S. pneumoniae penicillin-susceptible and Proteus mirabilis beta LAC+; 0.25 versus beta LAC+ versus strains of Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and K. oxytoca; 0.5 versus Haemophilus influenzae beta LAC-; 1 versus H. influenzae beta LAC+; 4 versus Legionella pneumophila beta LAC+; and 8 versus Enterococcus faecalis beta LAC-strains. Cefdinir was equally effective against both standard and high inocula of S. aureus strains producing A, B, C, or D beta LAC types. MICs were also generated versus quality-control reference strains.
TI  - Detection of bacteria in phagocyte-smears from septicemia-suspected blood by in situ hybridization using biotinylated probes.
AB  - We report herein the detection of intracellular bacteria in phagocyte-smears obtained from septicemia-suspected blood samples by in situ hybridization. This was obtained by using nick-translated biotin-11-dUTP-labeled DNA probes and streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase conjugates for visualization of the hybridized signals. The probes were made from random genomic DNA clones of bacteria which are frequently the causative agents of bacteremia, such as Staphylococcus spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp. and Enterobacter spp. When our in situ hybridization method was compared with conventional culture protocols for the ability to detect bacteria from the blood of patients suspected of having septicemia, 30 positive results were obtained in 50 specimens by in situ hybridization methods. In contrast, only 7 positive results were obtained by blood cultures. Thus, even if bacteria cannot be detected by conventional blood cultures and histology, our in situ hybridization method allows for direct observation of bacterial foci in circulating phagocytes and identification of the bacteria. Our investigations suggest that in septicemia, circulating polymorphonuclear neutrophils carry some surviving bacteria as well as metabolized bacterial DNA and RNA for a considerable period of time. Thus, our in situ hybridization method using the phagocyte-smears have diagnostic value for detecting most bacteria which cause septicemia.
TI  - Agar disk diffusion (Bauer-Kirby) tests with various fastidious and nonfastidious reference (ATCC) strains: comparison of several agar media.
AB  - Several agar media (Mueller-Hinton agar, MHA; diagnostic sensitivity test agar, DSTA; Schaedler agar, SchA; Todd-Hewitt agar with added yeast extract, THYA; Wilkins-Chalgren agar, WCA) were compared using the Bauer-Kirby agar disk diffusion test against six nonfastidious quality control strains: Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 and ATCC 29213, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and ATCC 35218, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, and Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212. MHA, DSTA, and THYA yielded essentially comparable inhibition zones. However, WCA and SchA antagonized cotrimoxazole and aminoglycoside antibiotics; furthermore, SchA antagonized polymyxin B, and both WCA and SchA antagonized imipenem against the P. aeruginosa strain, but not against the E. coli strains. Sheep blood-MHA (Bl-MHA), WCA, THYA, and DSTA were examined with Streptococcus pyogenes ATCC 19615, Streptococcus agalactiae ATCC 13813, and Streptococcus pneumoniae ATCC 6306. In comparison with Bl-MHA, both WCA and THYA yielded comparable inhibition zones against S. pyogenes; DSTA afforded suboptimal growth. DSTA yielded larger inhibition zones with the majority of antimicrobial drugs against S. agalactiae, whereas WCA and THYA enhanced the activity of oxacillin and penicillin G against this strain. S. pneumoniae strain ATCC 6306 grew well on Bl-MHA, yielded suboptimal growth on WCA and faint growth on THYA, and failed to grow on DSTA. Chocolate-supplemented sheep blood-MHA (CHOC-MHA) was compared with Haemophilus test medium (HTM), WCA with added NAD, and THYA with added hematin and NAD against Haemophilus influenzae strains ATCC 35056 and ATCC 49247. The activities of doxycycline and rifampin were enhanced against both strains by HTM, WCA+NAD, and THYA+hematin+NAD. Only WCA+NAD antagonized cotrimoxazole against both H. influenzae strains, an effect due to thymidine; however, HTM antagonized cotrimoxazole against S. aureus ATCC 25923 and E. coli ATCC 25922. It was concluded that Bl-MHA performed best for beta-hemolytic streptococci quality control strains. Likewise, CHOC-MHA was optimal for the two H. influenzae strains used in this comparative agar disk diffusion study.
TI  - [Staghorn renal lithiasis treated with shock waves. Bacteriologic aspects].
AB  - Struvite renal stones are caused by infection of the urine with bacteria that synthesize the enzyme urease. Ammonium is released by the breakdown of urea by urease, the urine becomes highly alkaline, and magnesium ammonium phosphate (struvite) and carbonate apatite crystallize. Incorporation of the infecting bacteria within the developing stone, results in a focus of infection that is resistant to conventional antimicrobial therapy, and which is manifested clinically by repeated urinary tract infection caused by persistent bacteriuria. Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) currently is accepted as the election treatment for most renal calculi. This trial examines the bacteriologic aspects pre and post-ESWL. Eighty adult patients, 47 females and 33 males, without clinical signs of urinary tract infections (UTI) were submitted to urine cultures pre and post-ESWL. The first 50 patients underwent during and post-ESWL, 150 blood cultures, which all proved to be negative, confirming very low risk of generalized sepsis. No patient presented fever, chills or rigors pre or postprocedures. With respect to urine cultures 43 patients (52.5%) had a pre-ESWL UTI, in comparison to 49 (60%) who had a UTI post-ESWL. The distribution of organisms pre and post-ESWL was as follows: Proteus mirabilis (22/22), Escherichia coli (11/11), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4/5), Klebsiella pneumoniae (2/2), Enterobacter cloacae (0/1), Alcaligenes odorans (1/2) Enterococcus faecalis (1/3), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (1/2) and Candida albicans (1/1). In this study 6 patients presented bacteriuria post-ESWL probably due to bacteria from inside the calculi. According to these results, the risk of bacteremia seems to be very low. In 60% of staghorn renal stones we could demonstrate a bacterial infection.

TI  - Differences in sensitivity to NADH of purified pyruvate dehydrogenase complexes of Enterococcus faecalis, Lactococcus lactis, Azotobacter vinelandii and Escherichia coli: implications for their activity in vivo.
AB  - The effect of NADH on the activity of the purified pyruvate dehydrogenase complexes (PDHc) of Enterococcus (Ec.) faecalis, Lactococcus lactis, Azotobacter vinelandii and Escherichia coli was determined in vitro. It was found that the PDHc of E. coli and L. lactis was active only at relatively low NADH/NAD ratios, whereas the PDHc of Ec. faecalis was inhibited only at high NADH/NAD ratios. The PDHc of Azotobacter vinelandii showed an intermediate sensitivity. The organisms were grown in chemostat culture under conditions that led to different intracellular NADH/NAD ratios and the PDHc activities in vivo could be calculated from the specific rates of product formation. Under anaerobic growth conditions, only Ec. faecalis expressed PDHc activity in vivo. The activities in vivo of the complexes of the different organisms were in good agreement with their properties determined in vitro. The physiological consequences of these results are discussed.
TI  - A fourth class of theta-replicating plasmids: the pAM beta 1 family from gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - Plasmid pAM beta 1 from Enterococcus faecalis uses a unidirectional theta mode of replication. We show here that this replication (i) is dependent on a plasmid-encoded replication protein (Rep) but not on a DNA structure typical for origins of most Rep-dependent plasmids and (ii) is initiated by DNA polymerase I (PolI). pAM beta 1 minimal replicon shares no homology with highly conserved ColE1-type replicons, which use PolI for initiation but do not encode a Rep, or with ColE2 and ColE3 replicons, which require PolI for replication and encode a Rep. We propose that pAM beta 1 and a number of other naturally occurring and closely related plasmids from a distinct plasmid class.
TI  - DNA cleavage, antiviral and cytotoxic reactions photosensitized by simple enediyne compounds.
AB  - Very potent antibiotic antitumor natural products contain a enediyne moiety which, upon thermal activation, is capable of abstracting hydrogens from DNA. 1,6-Diphenyl-3-hexene-1,5-diyne was selected as a candidate for inducing DNA strand breaks photochemically. Easily interconverted with light, both geometric isomers 1 and 2 were expected to be phototoxic. As anticipated, they photosensitized the production of strand breaks in double-stranded supercoiled pBR322, and in single-stranded M13 DNA. The DNA cleavage reactions were favored by the presence of oxygen and were inhibited by ethanol. Preliminary experiments with the (Z)-isomer indicated moderate light-dependent antiviral activity against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Sindbis virus, and mouse cytomegalovirus. The enediynes were cytotoxic to Escherichia coli, a gram-negative organism, to Streptococcus faecalis, a gram-positive organism, to Daphnia magna and to fish (Pimephales promelas), but only in the presence of light. The production of o-terphenyl, the expected product of Bergman cyclization of 1, could not be confirmed. However, both 1 and 2 photosensitized the formation of singlet oxygen and of superoxide anion radical, and photodynamic reactions could have been responsible for some of the phototoxic reactions observed.

TI  - [Clinical studies of S-1108 granules in the pediatric field].
AB  - We studied the clinical use of S-1108 granules in the pediatric field. The results are summarized as follows. 1. S-1108 was administered orally at doses ranging 6.85 and 17.6 mg/kg/day t.i.d. to 9 patients, including 5 cases of pharyngitis and 1 case each of lacunar tonsillitis, bronchitis, pneumonia and urinary tract infection. Clinical efficacies were excellent in 4 cases and good in 5 cases, hence an efficacy rate of 100% was obtained. 2. Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae (2 strains each) and Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis (1 strain each) were identified in these cases. Seven of the 8 strains were eliminated upon treatment and the other strain was decreased, hence an eradication rate of 87.5% was obtained. 3. Side effects observed were 1 case each of soft stools and diarrhea. As an abnormal laboratory test result, an increase in GPT level was observed. 4. No refusal of the drug occurred. 5. From the above results, we consider that this drug would be a useful new oral antibiotic for the pediatric field.
TI  - [Influence of S-1108 on intestinal bacterial flora].
AB  - The effect of S-1108, a new oral cephem antibiotic, on intestinal bacterial flora was studied in tetra-contaminated mice and pediatric patients. S-1108 in a fine granular form was administered at a dose of 15 mg/kg once a day for 5 consecutive days to mice infected with Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacteroides fragilis and Bifidobacterium breve. The viable fecal bacterial cell count of each of these 4 species of bacteria was slightly reduced in 5 days after the start of the drug administration. Five boys (weighing 12.0 to 42.0 kg) with bacterial infections were entered into this pediatric study. Their ages ranged from 2 years 4 months to 9 years 3 months. S-1108 (fine granules) was administered at a dose of 2.3 to 6.0 mg/kg, 3 times a day for 5 to 11 days. Cell counts of primary aerobes, anaerobes and total anaerobic cells decreased markedly in three patients, but in the remaining two patients the total number of aerobic and anaerobic cells did not change appreciably. Glucose-nonfermentating Gram-negative rods did not become predominant during the period of S-1108 administration. Candida became predominant in the three patients in whom the other bacteria had markedly decreased. Counts of predominant aerobic and anaerobic bacteria decreased markedly during the regimen in 3 out of 5 cases. S-1006 was detected in stools of the 3 cases at concentrations ranging from 235 to 516 micrograms/g during the administration of S-1108. Intestinal bacteria that produce beta-lactamase were not present in the feces of any of the patients. Based on these results, S-1108 (fine granules) appears to have relatively little effect on intestinal bacterial flora similarly to other new oral cephems. Because of individual differences, however, the drug may be excreted in the feces at high concentrations, and this would result in changes in intestinal bacterial flora. Therefore, attention must be given to fecal drug concentrations.
TI  - Characterization of the left 4 kb of conjugative transposon Tn916: determinants involved in excision.
AB  - The rate-limiting step in movement of the conjugative transposon Tn916, originally identified in Enterococcus faecalis, is believed to be an excision event that generates a non-replicative circular intermediate. When present on a plasmid vector in Escherichia coli, Tn916 generally excises at a high frequency. It was reported previously that insertion of Tn5 in a region near the left end of Tn916 eliminated the ability to excise; and the mutation could be complemented in trans. In this communication the nucleotide sequence of 4 kb of Tn916 DNA connecting the recently sequenced tet(M) determinant (Su et al., 1992; Burdett, 1990) with the left end of the transposon. Ten open reading frames (ORFs) were deduced, two of which (ORF3 and ORF4) were encoded in-frame within a third (ORF2). Mutants with Tn5 insertions in the ORF1 or ORF2 (ORF3 and ORF4) were defective in excision, but could be complemented in vivo by a co-resident plasmid containing the ORF1 or ORF2 determinant, respectively. The data support the view that both ORF1 and ORF2 are essential for excision. ORF1 and ORF2 are essentially identical to determinants designated xis-Tn and int-Tn, respectively, in the closely related Tn1545. A Tn5 insertion in ORF5 eliminated conjugative transfer between E. faecalis strains. Functions for the remaining ORFs (ORF6 through ORF10) remain unknown; however, nucleotide sequences within ORF6 and ORF9 had significant homology with sequence downstream of other tet(M) determinants.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of the glycylcyclines, a new class  of semisynthetic tetracyclines.
AB  - N,N-Dimethylglycylamido (DMG) derivatives of minocycline and 6-demethyl-6-deoxytetracycline are new semisynthetic tetracyclines referred to as the glycylcyclines. The in vitro activities of the glycylcyclines were evaluated in comparison with those of minocycline and tetracycline against strains carrying characterized tetracycline resistance determinants and against 995 recent clinical isolates obtained from geographically distinct medical centers in North America. The glycylcyclines were active against tetracycline-resistant strains carrying efflux [tet(A), tet(B), tet(C), and tet(D) in Escherichia coli and tet(K) in Staphylococcus aureus] and ribosomal protection [tet(M) in S. aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, and E. coli)] resistance determinants. Potent activity (MIC for 90% of strains, < or = 0.5 microgram/ml) was obtained with the glycylcyclines against methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant S. aureus, E. faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, and various streptococcal species. The glycylcyclines exhibited good activity against a wide diversity of gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, most of which were less susceptible to minocycline and tetracycline. The activities of the glycylcyclines against most organisms tested were comparable to each other. The in vivo efficacies of the glycylcyclines against acute lethal infections in mice when dosed intravenously were reflective of their in vitro activities. The glycylcyclines had efficacies comparable to that of minocycline against infections with methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains, a strain carrying tet(K), and a tetracycline-susceptible E. coli strain but exceeded the effectiveness of minocycline against infections with resistant isolates, including strains harboring tet(M) or tet(B). Levels of DMG-6-deoxytetracycline in serum were higher and more sustained than those of DMG-minocycline or minocycline. Our results show that the glycylcyclines have potent in vitro activities against a wide spectrum of gram-positive and gram-negative, aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, including many resistant strains. On the basis of their in vitro and in vivo activities, the glycylcyclines represent a significant advance to the tetracycline class of antibiotics and have good potential value for clinical efficacy.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of bile salts against common biliary pathogens. Effects of hydrophobicity of the molecule and in the presence of phospholipids.
AB  - In vitro studies have demonstrated that bile salts have cytotoxic and bacteriostatic properties. The cytotoxic effect of bile salts is reduced when lecithin is added. The effect of lecithin on the bacteriostatic property of bile salts is not known. In this report, we test the hypotheses that (1) the bacteriostatic activity of bile salts is a function of the hydrophobicity of the molecules, and (2) lecithin, by engaging the hydrophobic component of bile salts, attenuates the bacteriostatic property of these molecules. Two common biliary pathogens, Escherichia coli and Enterococcus fecalis, were tested in this experiment. The results demonstrate that hydrophobic bile salts (sodium taurodeoxycholate, sodium deoxycholate) have more significant inhibition on the growth of bacteria when compared with the hydrophilic bile salts (sodium taurocholate, sodium chenodeoxycholate, and sodium tauroursodeoxycholate). When lecithin is added, creating a mixed micellar solution and mimicking the in vivo conditions, the antibacterial activities of even the more potent bacteriostatic bile salts are significantly reduced. The finding that lecithin significantly attenuates the bacteriostatic property of even the hydrophobic bile salts raises questions about the clinical significance of such bacteriostatic effect in vivo; as bile salts in the bile exist in mixed micellar solution.
TI  - Incidence of bacteria from clean-catch and catheterized urine of nursing home residents.
AB  - Urine cultures from 1990 through 1992 were analyzed to determine the incidence of common isolates in residents from over 50 nursing homes in Oklahoma. Of all 11,480 isolates in clean-catch and catheterized specimens, the most common were: Escherichia coli (24% of all isolates), Pseudomonas aeruquinosa (11%), Proteus mirabilis (10%), Enterococcus faecalis (8%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (7%), Providencia stuartii (5%), and Staphylococcus aureus (4%). The most striking findings of this study were the similarities in frequencies of isolates from clean-catch and catheterized urines, the common occurrence of P. stuartii, and the low proportion of urea-splitting P. stuartii isolates from catheterized specimens.
TI  - The 2.0-A resolution structure of Escherichia coli histidine-containing phosphocarrier protein HPr. A redetermination.
AB  - The x-ray structure of Escherichia coli HPr has been redetermined at 2.0-A resolution. In contrast to the previous study (El-Kabbani, O. A. L., Waygood, E. B., and Delbaere, L. T. J. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 12926-12929), the overall structure is, in general, similar to other reported NMR and x-ray HPr structures, although there are some important differences in detail. The overall folding topology of HPr is a classical open-faced beta-sandwich, consisting of four antiparallel beta-strands and three alpha-helices. The least square refinement produced an R index of 0.135 for all measured unique data between 8.0 and 2.0 A resolution. The active center consists of His15 which is hydrogen bonded to a sulfate anion, and Arg17 which has a fully open conformation. This corresponds to the first observed "semi-closed" conformation of the active center of HPr. The Streptococcus faecalis HPr structure (Jia, Z., Vandonselaar, M., Quail, J. W., and Delbaere, L. T. J. (1993) Nature 361, 94-97) has the "open" conformation in which the side chains of His15 and Arg17 are directed as far away from each other as possible. The Bacillus subtilis HPr (Herzberg, O., Reddy, P., Sutrina, S., Saier, M. H., Jr., Reizer, J., and Kapadia, G. (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 89, 2499-2503) has the "closed" conformation in which the side chains of His15 and Arg17 are close together with a sulfate anion located in the active center. The open conformation represents the unphosphorylated form of HPr whereas the closed conformation likely resembles the phosphorylated form of HPr. The semi-closed conformation observed in the E. coli HPr structure could represent a structural intermediate on the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation pathway of HPr.
TI  - Cloning, nucleotide sequence and characterization of the mannitol dehydrogenase gene from Rhodobacter sphaeroides.
AB  - Transposon mutagenesis and antibiotic enrichment were employed to isolate a mutant of Rhodobacter sphaeroides Si4 designated strain M22, that had lost the ability to grow on D-mannitol and to produce the enzyme mannitol dehydrogenase (MDH). DNA flanking the transposon in the mutant strain was used as a probe for the identification and cloning of the MDH gene (mtlK). A 5.5 kb EcoRI/BglII fragment from R. sphaeroides Si4 was isolated and shown to complement the mutation in R. sphaeroides M22. Successful complementation required that a promoter of the vector-plasmid pRK415 be present, suggesting that the mtlK gene is part of a larger operon. Using oligonucleotides derived from the N-terminal sequence of MDH as probes mtlK was located on the complementing fragment and the gene was sequenced. The mtlK open reading frame encodes a protein of 51,404 Da with an N-terminal sequence identical to that obtained from amino acid analysis of the purified MDH. The MDH of R. sphaeroides Si4 exhibits distant similarity to the mannitol-1-phosphate dehydrogenases from Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis, with 28.1% and 26.3% identity, respectively. Mutant strains deficient in MtlK displayed substantial levels of sorbitol dehydrogenase activity, originally thought to be only a minor activity associated with the MDH enzyme. It is likely that we have uncovered an additional polyol dehydrogenase with activity for sorbitol. The mtlK gene can be used for overexpression of MDH in E. coli in order to obtain sufficient amounts of enzyme for further investigations and applications.
TI  - Effect of a defined continuous-flow derived bacterial culture and dietary lactose on Salmonella typhimurium colonization in broiler chickens.
AB  - A defined bacterial culture protective against Salmonella typhimurium cecal colonization in broiler chicks was derived utilizing a continuous-flow (CF) culture apparatus. Chicks receiving the CF culture in combination with a diet containing dietary lactose were protected against cecal colonization by S. typhimurium. The culture consisted of a mixture of gram-positive and gram-negative facultative and strictly anaerobic bacteria. The isolates were identified as Enterococcus avium, two strains of Enterococcus faecalis (designated A and B), Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus animalis, a Lactobacillus that could not be identified to species level (designated strain CMS), Citrobacter freundii, Escherichia coli, E. fergusonii, Bifidobacterium animals, and Propionibacterium acidipropionici. Results indicated that CF cultures can be used as a tool to identify bacteria which are antagonistic to S. typhimurium in the chick cecum.
TI  - Molecular cloning, identification, and sequence of the hyaluronan synthase gene from group A Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - The hyaluronan (HA) synthase of Group A Streptococci has been identified by transposon mutagenesis and deletion analysis. The genes for the HA synthase and a recently identified UDP-Glc dehydrogenase (Dougherty, B. A., and van de Rijn, I. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 7118-7124) reside on a contiguous stretch of 3.2-kilobase pair DNA that can direct HA biosynthesis in Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli as well as mutant Streptococcus (DeAngelis, P. L., Papaconstantinou, J., and Weigel, P. H. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 14568-14571). The synthase contains 395 residues (calculated Mr = 45,063) and migrates on SDS-PAGE with a molecular mass of 42 kDa. E. coli K5, which synthesizes UDP-glucuronic acid for production of its endogenous capsular polysaccharide, can make HA if it contains a plasmid encoding the intact 42-kDa protein. E. coli SURE or chi 1448 cells containing the same construct, however, cannot produce HA since these strains cannot make both required sugar nucleotide precursors. The HA synthase is predicted to be an integral membrane protein with four membrane-associated helices, which is consistent with the location of the enzyme activity in Streptococci. There is significant homology between the HA synthase and the Rhizobium nodC gene product, an enzyme that synthesizes chitin-like oligomers. This is the first description at the molecular level of an enzyme shown to synthesize a glycosaminoglycan.
TI  - [Prevalence of bacterial pathogens and antimicrobial susceptibility: a multicenter study in Akita prefecture].
AB  - We report the prevalence of bacterial pathogens isolated from various clinical specimens in 17 medical centers in Akita during the period of December 1990 to February 1991, and their antimicrobial susceptibility. The results were as follows: 1. The total number of isolates was 8,929 and common bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus (18.7%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (11.8%), Escherichia coli (10.1%), coagulase negative staphylococcus (6.7%) and Enterococcus faecalis (5.0%). This is similar to our previous result which was reported in the same season in 1987. 2. S. aureus was a common isolate from sputum, throat swab, pus, and blood. 53% of isolated S. aureus were methicillin-resistant. Arbekacin (ABK) had a high degree of activity (99%) against methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Minocycline (MINO) retained activity against 70% of MRSA strains, and quinolones only 20%. 3. P. aeruginosa and E. coli were frequently found in urine from the patients in the small hospitals. More than 80% of the P. aeruginosa strains were sensitive to imipenem (IPM), cefsulodin (CFS) and amikacin (AMK). The susceptibility of P. aeruginosa to ceftazidime (CAZ) and piperacillin (PIPC) had been decreasing for the last 3 years. 4. CNS were frequently found in blood, pus, and pleural effusion from the patients in the large hospitals. The isolates were resistant to most antibiotics. 5. Enterococcus was common isolates from urine and ascites, the susceptibility to cephem was low. 6. We conclude that attention should be specially paid to S. aureus, P. aeruginosa CNS and E. Faecalis.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of enterococci: results of a survey conducted by the United Kingdom National External Quality Assessment Scheme for Microbiology.
AB  - Six strains of enterococci were distributed to participants in the United Kingdom National External Quality Assessment Scheme for Microbiology with a request that they be tested for susceptibility to ampicillin/penicillin and vancomycin and for high-level resistance to gentamicin. More than 98% of laboratories correctly reported the resistant strains as resistant to penicillin and ampicillin. However, there was a poorer correlation for the susceptible strains, with only 1-6% and 69-83% of laboratories reporting the strains as susceptible to penicillin and ampicillin respectively. Those laboratories which used 5-25 micrograms ampicillin discs or breakpoint methods reported proportionally more results correctly for the susceptible strains than those using 2 micrograms discs. Participants using Escherichia coli or an enterococcus as a control and those not using a control at all were more likely to report ampicillin-susceptible strains correctly than those using Staphylococcus aureus NCTC 6571 (Oxford strain). For vancomycin-susceptible and high-level vancomycin-resistant strains, 93-96% and 96-99% of reports respectively were correct. For the low-level vancomycin-resistant strains, only 50-54% of reports were correct. Participants using a 5 micrograms vancomycin disc reported proportionally more of the low-level resistant strains correctly than those using 10, 20, 25, 30 or 100 micrograms discs. Participants not using controls were proportionally more likely to report the low-level resistant strains as susceptible than those using an enterococcus or S. aureus NCTC 6571 as a control. For the high-level gentamicin-resistant (HLGR) strains, 96-98% of reports were correct. Depending on the strain, between 12% and 41% of participants also reported high-level resistance for the strains which were not HLGR. Those using low-content discs (< or = 30 micrograms) and breakpoint or MIC methods were more likely to report strains which were not HLGR as HLGR than those using high-content discs. Those using an enterococcus as a control were less likely to report strains which were not HLGR as HLGR than those using either S. aureus NCTC 6571 or E. coli as a control and those not using a control.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activities of sultamicillin against clinical isolates obtained from outpatients].
AB  - Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined for sultamicillin (SBTPC), and for other major oral beta-lactam agents against clinically isolated strains collected from outpatients during a period from August, 1992 to February, 1993, and the following conclusions were obtained. 1. The ratio of penicillinase (PCase)-producing strains of Staphylococcus aureus was 96.0% and that of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) was 12.0%. MIC90 of SBTPC against S. aureus including MRSA was 6.25 micrograms/ml. No increasing tendency was observed for S. aureus resistant to SBTPC. 2. No resistant strains were found among Streptococcus pyogenes and Enterococcus faecalis against penicillins (PCs) including SBTPC. But PCs and cephems (CEPs) insensitive or resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae were observed in 22.0% among all the strains of S. pneumoniae. 3. 100% of the tested both strains of Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis were beta-lactamase producers. 12.0% of the tested strains of Haemophilus influenzae and 16.0% of the strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae were also beta-lactamase producers. SBTPC showed strong antimicrobial activity against most of these beta-lactamase producing strains. However, in our study of beta-lactamase productivity using plural substrates and test methods, it appeared that a part of strains of E. coli might produce beta-lactamase of "Extended broad-spectrum". MICs of SBTPC and CEPs against those strains were distributed rather in a high range. 4. The results of the study suggested that the resistant strains of S. pneumoniae against PCs and CEPs might be increasing year by year. Some of strains of E. coli, resistance against the 2 agents were observed. It is important to keep observing changes in resistance of such organisms in the future. 5. The antimicrobial activities of SBTPC against clinically isolated strains in this study indicated potential problems such as those mentioned above. It is, however, also confirmed that SBTPC shows still strong antimicrobial activities against most of beta-lactamase producing strains found in daily medical examinations. Taking into consideration of the strong activities of SBTPC against so-called indirect pathogenicity caused by beta-lactamase producing indigenous bacteria reported lately, SBTPC may be a useful antibiotic for community acquired infections in the 1990's.
TI  - In vitro activities of BAY Y3118, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and fleroxacin against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens from respiratory tract and soft tissue infections.
AB  - BAY Y3118 was highly active against Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Legionella pneumophila, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus (except quinolone-resistant, methicillin-resistant S. aureus), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC for 90% of strains tested [MIC90], 0.063 micrograms/ml). For Enterococcus faecalis and Corynebacterium jeikeium, MIC90s were 4 and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. BAY Y3118 was as active as ciprofloxacin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) and had potent activity against Bacteroides fragilis (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml).
TI  - Blockage of urethral catheters by bacterial biofilms.
AB  - We report the case of a 63-year-old woman whose indwelling urethral catheter became blocked regularly at 4-5 day intervals over a period of 10 weeks. 'Worm-like' structures 25-30 cm in length were found either in the catheter, completely occluding the lumen, or in the drainage tube thereby blocking the valve of the drainage bag. Electron microscopy showed that these structures were composed of bacteria, while culture revealed them to be mixed communities of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis and Proteus mirabilis. Following treatment with ciprofloxacin, catheter drainage continued freely for a further period of 10 weeks.
TI  - Bacterial adherence to hydrophilic polymer-coated polyurethane stents.
AB  - Biliary stent blockage by adherence of bacteria and formation of biofilm is a major problem in endoscopic stenting procedures. We have investigated bacterial adherence to hydrophilic polymer (Hydromer)-coated polyurethane stents in stationary and perfusion experiments. Adherence of gram negative and gram positive organisms under stationary conditions was similar between Hydromer-coated and non-coated control polyurethane stents; however, a marked 1 to 3 log reduction in adherence to Hydromer-coated stents occurred when perfusion experiments in phosphate buffer solution or bile were performed. The results suggest that Hydromer-coated polyurethane stents could be useful in preventing complications caused by biliary stent blockage.
TI  - [A clinical study of lomefloxacin on the patients with urinary tract infections--focused on lomefloxacin-induced photosensitivity reaction].
AB  - Between April and October 1990, photosensitivity reactions were observed in 19 out of 338 patients who were administered lomefloxacin (LFLX) for the treatment of urinary tract infections (UTI) in our hospital. To certify the effectiveness and safety of LFLX to UTI, we carried out a controlled study with fixed dosages and durations. Patients with acute uncomplicated UTI and chronic complicated UTI were enrolled and LFLX dosages of 200 mg b.i.d. for 7 days and 14 days, respectively, were administered. The overall efficacy rates were 100% and 84% respectively. Concerning the bacteriological effect, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were eliminated in every case, while 3 strains of Enterococcus faecalis 2 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and one strain of Enterobacter cloacae persisted. No photosensitivity reaction or noteworthy severe adverse reactions were observed among 200 cases enrolled in this study of restricted dosages and durations. We, urologists, need to be well-informed about photosensitivity reactions induced by quinolone antimicrobial agents. LFLX was proven to be effective in UTI without showing any photosensitivity reactions when administered by our fixed dosages and durations.
TI  - Distribution of free and liposome-encapsulated cefoxitin in experimental intra-abdominal sepsis in rats.
AB  - The distributions of radiolabelled free cefoxitin (FC) and liposome-encapsulated  cefoxitin (LC) were compared in an animal model of intra-abdominal sepsis. Intraperitoneally administered LC was initially retained in the peritoneal cavity with subsequent preferential drug targeting to the liver (14% injected LC) and spleen (6% injected LC) by 3 h post-injection. Differing patterns of liposomal drug and lipid retention indicated that drug release from the liposome complex occurred within the peritoneum, liver and spleen. Intraperitoneal FC was rapidly taken up into the systemic circulation, with peak recovery in the blood (9% injected FC) and liver (5% injected FC) at 1 h post-injection. FC was also rapidly eliminated; 7% of the injected drug was recovered in the kidney 1 h post-injection. A negligible amount of FC was recovered in the spleen and very little FC or LC was found in the lungs of treated animals. Unlike FC, LC was found to provide a sustained bactericidal drug level (> 40 micrograms mL-1) in the peritoneal fluid for up to 5 h post-injection. LC also achieved significantly higher drug levels, compared with FC, within the liver at 3 and 5 h post-injection. Since severe intra-abdominal sepsis is often characterized by the presence of intraphagocytic bacteria in hepatic and splenic reticuloendothelial systems, the enhanced delivery of liposome-encapsulated anti-microbial agents, such as cefoxitin, to the liver and spleen may provide a more effective treatment for the septic condition.
TI  - Deamidation of HPr, a phosphocarrier protein of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system, involves asparagine 38 (HPr-1) and asparagine 12 (HPr-2) in isoaspartyl acid formation.
AB  - Histidine-containing protein, HPr, of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system in Escherichia coli, when incubated at elevated temperatures forms many species of protein. The two major species are HPr-1 and HPr-2, which have been shown to lack one or two amides, respectively (Anderson, B., Weigel, N., Kundig, W., and Roseman, S. (1971) J. Biol. Chem. 246, 7023-7033). The formation of HPr-1 and HPr-2 is shown to be pH-dependent and does not occur readily below pH 6. Investigation of the identities and properties of the two residues that deamidate involved creation of site-directed mutants at the 6 glutamine and 2 asparagine residues of HPr; description of their deamidation species by isoelectric focusing; determination of their relative antibody binding properties; assay of their phosphoacceptor and phosphodonor activities; characterization of tryptic and V8-protease peptides; obtaining two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance spectra of HPr, HPr-1, and several mutants. It was determined that the sequential deamidation of Asn-38 and Asn-12 yields HPr-1 and HPr-2. Both residues exist as Asn-Gly pairs, and both deamidations probably form isoaspartyl acid. HPr from Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus carnosus which also have Asn-Gly at residues 38 and 39 form HPr-1 species presumably by deamidation. HPr from Streptococcus faecalis which does not have Asn-38 does not form a HPr-1 species. The E. coli mutant HPrs, N12D and Q51E, residues that may be involved in the active site, had impaired phosphohydrolysis properties and decreased phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system activity.
TI  - Effect of LPS on epithelial integrity and bacterial uptake in the polarized human enterocyte-like cell line Caco-2.
AB  - Bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) has been speculated to facilitate bacterial translocation by a mechanism involving physical disruption of the gut mucosal barrier. Polarized, cultured intestinal epithelial cells (Caco-2 cells) were used to study the effect of LPS on enterocyte structure, viability, and susceptibility to bacterial invasion. Varying concentrations of biologically active LPS were incubated with enterocytes for 1 and 16 hr. LPS had no noticeable effect on enterocyte viability or morphology, as measured by uptake of vital dyes, by distribution of cytoskeletal filamentous actin, and by visualization of subcellular ultrastructure. Transepithelial electrical resistance was similar in enterocyte cultures incubated with LPS for 1 hr, but there was a noticeable decrease after 16 hr, indicating a loss of epithelial integrity after prolonged exposure to LPS. The effect of LPS on bacterial uptake was studied using six strains of enteric bacteria with varying abilities to invade Caco-2 cells: Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella typhimurium, Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli (2 strains), and Enterococcus faecalis. Electron microscopy showed enteric bacteria in intimate association with enterocyte apical microvilli, and internalized bacteria were consistently observed within cytoplasmic, membrane-bound vacuoles. Following a 1-hr incubation of individual strains of enteric bacteria with Caco-2 cells, numbers of viable intracellular bacteria varied significantly between individual bacterial strains, but numbers of intracellular bacteria were similar for each strain incubated with enterocytes exposed to 0, 10, and 100 micrograms LPS for 1 and 16 hr. Thus, although prolonged exposure to LPS might have some effect on enterocyte culture integrity (as measured by decreased electrical resistance), LPS had no discernible effect on enterocyte structure, viability, and susceptibility to bacterial invasion. These results suggested that LPS-induced bacterial translocation might not involve loss of epithelial viability, or facilitated entry of bacteria into intestinal epithelial cells.
TI  - Characterization of the traC determinant of the Enterococcus faecalis hemolysin-bacteriocin plasmid pAD1: binding of sex pheromone.
AB  - pAD1, a conjugative, 60-kb, hemolysin-bacteriocin plasmid in Enterococcus faecalis, encodes a mating response to a small peptide sex pheromone, cAD1, secreted by potential recipient bacteria. A gene, traC, encoding a 60.7-kDa protein with a typical amino terminal signal peptide, was identified within a region that appears to encode a product that binds to exogenous pheromone. A cloned segment of DNA containing traC resulted in specific binding of cells to synthetic cAD1. The putative traC product has strong similarity to a product of the E. faecalis plasmid pCF10 as well as oligopeptide binding proteins of Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, and Bacillus subtilis.
TI  - Generation of restriction map of Enterococcus faecalis OG1 and investigation of growth requirements and regions encoding biosynthetic function.
AB  - A defined synthetic medium was used to determine the amino acid requirements of Enterococcus faecalis OG1 and to demonstrate the absence of a requirement for exogenous purines or pyrimidines. Genomic libraries prepared from strain OG1 were transduced into Escherichia coli auxotrophic mutants, and cloned DNAs which complemented pyrC, pyrD, purF, purL, and guaAB mutations were identified. These and other cloned DNAs with known functions were localized on a restriction map of OG1 which was generated with SfiI (5 fragments), AscI (9 fragments), and NotI (15 fragments); the size of the OG1 chromosome was revised from a previous estimate of approximately 2,750 kb to 2,825 kb. The synthetic medium and the restriction map should be useful for studying enterococcal metabolic functions and the relationships between chromosomally encoded genes.
TI  - Multicentre survey of the comparative in-vitro activity of piperacillin/tazobactam against bacteria from hospitalized patients in the British Isles.
AB  - Twenty-nine British and Irish hospitals each collected up to 300 bacterial isolates from in-patients. The organisms were identified by an appropriate API system or, for staphylococci, by their Gram and coagulase reactions. Disc susceptibility tests were performed. Isolates that gave zones < or = 25 mm to piperacillin/tazobactam (75 micrograms + 10 micrograms) discs were sent to a central laboratory for re-examination and determination of MIC, together with a sample of the more susceptible organisms. Results were evaluated for 6724 isolates. Over 95% of the isolates of Escherichia coli, klebsiellae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus, Moraxella and Bacteriodes, spp. streptococci, pneumococci and Enterococcus faecalis were susceptible to piperacillin/tazobactam (defined as giving a zone > or = 22 mm to a 75 micrograms + 10 micrograms disc), as were 86% of Acinetobacter spp. and 82% of the Citrobacter, Enterobacter, Morganella and Serratia group. Tazobactam particularly extended the activity of piperacillin against E. coli isolates (96% susceptible cf. 61% to piperacillin alone) klebsiellae (95% cf. 70%), P. mirabilis (99% cf. 86%), and Acinetobacter spp. (86% cf. 53%). Occasional (18%) resistance in Enterobacter, Serratia and Citrobacger spp. was probably caused by stable depression of Class I beta-lactamases, which are inhibited poorly by tazobactam. High resistance frequencies (> 25%) were found for Enterococcus faecium and Xanthomonas maltophilia. Tazobactam potentiated piperacillin against beta-lactamase-producing methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, but the mode inhibition zone of piperacillin/tazobactam discs was only 26 mm, compared to 38 mm for beta-lactamase-negative isolates. Nevertheless, fewer than 5% of the enzyme producers appeared resistant to 8 + 4 mg/L piperacillin/tazobactam in MIC tests. Similar behaviour was noted for coagulase-negative staphylococci. Amongst the eleven comparator drugs, ceftazidime, gentamicin and ciprofloxacin were as active as piperacillin/tazobactam against most enterobacteria. However, Acinetobacter and Bacteroides spp. and enterococci were resistant to ceftazidime, and Bacteroides spp., enterococci, pneumococci and other streptococci were inherently resistant to ciprofloxacin and gentamicin. Cefuroxime, ampicillin and co-amoxiclav had narrower spectra. Only imipenem showed a consistently wider spectrum and lower frequency of resistance than piperacillin/tazobactam.
TI  - Isolation of a Streptococcus pyogenes gene locus that directs hyaluronan biosynthesis in acapsular mutants and in heterologous bacteria.
AB  - A contiguous 3-kilobase pair region of DNA was isolated from Group A Streptococcus pyogenes (GAS) that can direct hyaluronic acid (HA) capsule biosynthesis in acapsular mutants as well as heterologous bacteria. The DNA was identified by transposon 916 insertional mutagenesis and subcloned into a plasmid shuttle vector. Mutant acapsular GAS or Enterococcus faecalis containing this plasmid, but not vector alone, displayed a mucoid phenotype on agar plates, possessed a capsule as seen by light microscopy, and produced HA in quantities comparable with wild-type GAS. The polysaccharide was shown to be authentic HA based on its recognition by a specific proteoglycan and its degradation by Streptomyces hyaluronate lyase. Escherichia coli with the complementing plasmid also produced HA but at only 10% of the level made by the above cells. E. coli minicell analysis showed that two proteins, 42 and 45 kDa, are expressed by the functional DNA insert. Deletion analysis of the insert in the minicells revealed that the 42-kDa protein is essential for HA production. This is the first demonstration of reconstitution of HA capsule biosynthesis in vivo.
TI  - Complementation of an Enterococcus hirae (Streptococcus faecalis) mutant in the alpha subunit of the H(+)-ATPase by cloned genes from the same and different species.
AB  - We isolated an Enterococcus hirae (formerly Streptococcus faecalis) mutant, designated MS117, in which 'G' at position 301 of the alpha-subunit gene of the F1F0 type of H(+)-ATPase was deleted. MS117 had low H(+)-ATPase activity, was deficient in the regulatory system of cytoplasmic pH, and was unable to grow at pH 6.0. When the alpha-subunit gene of E. hirae H(+)-ATPase was ligated with the shuttle vector pHY300PLK at the downstream region of the tet gene of the vector, it was expressed without its own promoter in MS117, and the mutation of MS117 was complemented; the mutant harbouring the plasmid had the ability to maintain a neutral cytoplasm and grew at pH 6.0. We next transformed MS117 with pHY300PLK containing the alpha-subunit gene of Bacillus megaterium F1F0-ATPase constructed in the same way. The transformant grew at pH 6.0, and the ATP hydrolysis activity was recovered. These results suggested that an active hybrid H(+)-ATPase containing the B. megaterium alpha subunit was produced, and that the hybrid enzyme regulated the enterococcal cytoplasmic pH, although the function of the B. megaterium enzyme did not include pH regulation. Thus, our present results support the previous proposal that the enterococcal cytoplasmic pH is regulated by the F1F0 type of H(+)-ATPase.
TI  - Bacterial flora of the urinary tract of pigs associated with cystitis and pyelonephritis.
AB  - Twenty-three cases of porcine cystitis and pyelonephritis were examined bacteriologically. Eubacterium suis was found in 21 cases. The isolation of large numbers of Escherichia coli in the upper urinary tract was associated with linear renal scarring. An unidentifiable streptococcus and Enterococcus faecalis were isolated from a case of purulent ureteritis, pyelitis and pyelonephritis. The bacterial flora from cases of cystitis and pyelonephritis was different from that isolated from sows with asymptomatic bacteriuria.
TI  - [A nationwide survey of antimicrobial susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibiotics in Japan (1988-1990)].
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical isolates to  antibacterial agents at 149 hospitals throughout Japan from September to December in both 1989 and 1990. In this study, identifications and susceptibility testings were carried out at each hospital laboratory. The susceptibility testings were performed according to the disk diffusion method recommended by NCCLS. Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci showed high or moderate resistance rates to beta-lactam antibiotics, but Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae were highly susceptible to them. Enterococcus faecalis was susceptible to imipenem (IPM) and piperacillin but resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics and aminoglycosides. Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis were susceptible to beta-lactam drugs and aminoglycosides. Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa had a good susceptibility to IPM and aminoglycosides. Bacteroides fragilis was highly susceptible to IPM. IPM had strong antibacterial activity to many species of clinical isolates, including strains which were resistant to commonly used antibiotics.
TI  - Synthetic bactericidal peptide based on CAP37: a 37-kDa human neutrophil granule-associated cationic antimicrobial protein chemotactic for monocytes.
AB  - CAP37 (cationic antimicrobial protein of molecular mass 37 kDa) is a multifunctional protein isolated from the granules of human neutrophils. It is antibiotic and chemotactic and binds lipopolysaccharide. A synthetic peptide, amino acid sequence NQGRHFCGGALIHARFVMTAASCFQ, based on residues 20-44 of CAP37 protein mimics its antibiotic and lipopolysaccharide binding action. Peptide 20-44, at the concentrations tested, has antibacterial activity against Salmonella typhimurium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus aureus. The bactericidal action of the peptide was pH dependent, with maximum activity at pH 5.0 and pH 5.5 and decreased activity at pH 7.0. Various truncations, substitutions, and other modifications in the sequence deteriorate its activity. Free sulfhydryl groups and/or disulfide bridge formation are required for optimum antibiotic activity, since substitution of serines for, or alkylation of, cysteine residues 26 and 42 eliminates bactericidal activity. Evidently amino acids 20-44 represent an important, perhaps principal, antibacterial domain of CAP37. This peptide should provide new insight into the mechanism of antimicrobial activity of CAP37 and may serve as a model for new, useful, synthetic antibiotics.
TI  - Oral infectivity and bacterial interactions with mononuclear phagocytes.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to clarify the association between the oral infectivity of a bacterial strain and its susceptibility to ingestion by mononuclear phagocytes or ability to survive within them. Ten bacterial strains tested--all of known oral infectivity--comprised Salmonella typhimurium, Listeria monocytogenes (three strains), Escherichia coli (two strains), Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacteroides fragilis, and a Bacteroides sp. The phagocytic uptake of each strain was measured as the bacteria to phagocyte ratio after mononuclear phagocytes in mouse peritoneal exudate were permitted to ingest bacteria in vivo for 3 min. The three Listeria strains were the most susceptible to phagocytic uptake and the Salmonella strain was relatively resistant. The intracellular survival of each strain was studied during a subsequent 2 h in-vitro incubation of the mononuclear phagocytes that had been permitted to ingest bacteria in vivo. The strains with the best intracellular survival were Ent. faecalis and two of the three Listeria strains. The ability of S. typhimurium to survive intracellularly was intermediate but better than that of the two E. coli strains. Oral infectivity was not consistently correlated with susceptibility to ingestion by mononuclear phagocytes or ability to survive within them.
TI  - Ampicillin and ampicillin-sulbactam dilution tests with mixed cultures of Bacteroides fragilis, Escherichia coli and Enterococcus.
AB  - Bacterial interactions in mixed infections may compromise antimicrobial therapy.  The in vitro bactericidal activity of ampicillin and ampicillin-sulbactam against aerobic/anaerobic mixed cultures of Bacteroides fragilis, Escherichia coli and Enterococcus spp. was studied by means of broth dilution tests. The MBC of ampicillin for Enterococcus faecalis 6 was 0.25 mg/l when tested singly; in association with B. fragilis 1, however, the MBC for E. faecalis 6 was 16 mg/l. When tested singly E. coli 9 and B. fragilis 1 were both killed by ampicillin at a concentration of 4 mg/l in combination with 1 mg/l sulbactam. When both strains were associated, the MBC for B. fragilis 1 rose to > 256 mg/l. Results obtained indicate that the behaviour of bacteria as determined in pure cultures is not necessarily identical with the antibiotic susceptibility present in mixed cultures. It was shown that, besides beta-lactamase production by involved bacteria, other factors contribute to the alteration of bacterial susceptibility in mixed cultures. Synergistic and antagonistic effects between associated organisms were observed. For example, it was found that two moderately sensitive bacterial strains were resistant in mixed culture.
TI  - Interpretive criteria and quality control parameters for determining bacterial susceptibility to fosfomycin tromethamine.
AB  - Studies with fosfomycin tromethamine disks containing 200 micrograms of fosfomycin and 50 micrograms of glucose-6-phosphate confirmed the following zone diameter criteria for the NCCLS method: < or = 12 mm for resistant (MIC > or = 256 micrograms/ml), 13-15 mm for intermediate (MIC 128 micrograms/ml) and > or = 16 mm for susceptible (MIC < or = 64 micrograms/ml). Additional studies defined acceptable MIC and zone diameter ranges for the following quality control strains: Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, MIC 0.5 to 4.0 micrograms/ml, zone diameter 23 to 29 mm; Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, zone diameter 26 to 32 mm; Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27813, MIC 2.0 to 8.0 micrograms/ml; and Enterococcus faecalis, ATCC 29212, MIC 16 to 64 micrograms/ml.
TI  - Stabilization of mRNA in an Escherichia coli cell-free translation system.
AB  - It became clear that mRNA can be stabilized in a cell-free translation system of  Escherichia coli by hybridization with a small DNA fragment at its 3' terminus. The stability increased when a small DNA fragment containing a stable hairpin structure with a GAAA loop was used. The enhancement of stabilization was brought about because the hairpin structure is resistant towards the nucleases contained in the translation system. The hairpin structure is effective by stabilizing the added DNA fragment itself towards the nucleases.
TI  - Quantitative and Qualitative Analysis of Bacteria in Er(III) Solution by Thin-Film Magnetopheresis.
AB  - Magnetic deposition, quantitation, and identification of bacteria reacting with the paramagnetic trivalent lanthanide ion, Er, was evaluated. The magnetic deposition method was dubbed thin-film magnetopheresis. The optimization of the magnetic deposition protocol was accomplished with Escherichia coli as a model organism in 150 mM NaCl and 5 mM ErCl(3) solution. Three gram-positive bacteria, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, and Enterococcus faecalis, and four gram-negative bacteria, E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, and Klebsiella pneumoniae, were subsequently investigated. Quantitative analysis consisted of the microscopic cell count and a scattered-light scanning of the magnetically deposited material aided by the computer data acquisition system. Qualitative analysis consisted of Gram stain differentiation and fluorescein isothiocyanate staining in combination with selected antisera against specific types of bacteria on the solid substrate. The magnetic deposition protocol allowed quantitative detection of E. coli down to the concentration of 10 CFU ml, significant in clinical diagnosis applications such as urinary tract infections. Er did not interfere with the typical appearance of the Gram-stained bacteria nor with the antigen recognition by the antibody in the immunohistological evaluations. Indirect antiserum-fluorescein isothiocyanate labelling correctly revealed the presence of E. faecalis and P. aeruginosa in the magnetically deposited material obtained from the mixture of these two bacterial species. On average, the reaction of gram-positive organisms was significantly stronger to the magnetic field in the presence of Er than the reaction of gram-negative organisms. The thin-film magnetophoresis offers promise as a rapid method for quantitative and qualitative analysis of bacteria in solutions such as urine or environmental water.
TI  - Sensitivity of elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu) from different bacterial species to the antibiotics efrotomycin, pulvomycin and MDL 62879.
AB  - The sensitivity of elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu) from different species of bacteria to the EF-Tu-binding antibiotics efrotomycin, pulvomycin and MDL 62879 was tested by measuring the effect of these antibiotics on cell-free protein synthesis systems. EF-Tu from four different Gram-negative species was sensitive to all three antibiotics. Among Gram-positive bacteria, EF-Tu of Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis was resistant to efrotomycin and less sensitive to pulvomycin than EF-Tu of Gram-negative bacteria. EF-Tus from streptococci were significantly less sensitive than EF-Tus from Gram-negative bacteria to both efrotomycin and pulvomycin. All of the EF-Tus were sensitive to MDL 62879. The same sensitivity pattern emerged from GDP exchange assays, performed with partially purified EF-Tu from different bacterial species and pure Escherichia coli EF-Ts. These results suggest that the site of action of MDL 62879 is more conserved among bacterial species than those of efrotomycin and pulvomycin. Heterogeneity of EF-Tus from different bacterial species was also reflected in differences in their apparent molecular masses estimated by SDS-PAGE. EF-Tus from the Gram-positive species had higher molecular masses than those from all but one of the Gram-negative species.
TI  - [Evaluation of a micromethod for the bactericidal activity of five disinfectants  on 108 hospital strains].
AB  - The authors studied 5 disinfectants containing aldehyde and quaternary ammonium against 108 hospital strains. The minimal bactericidal activities (MBC) were determined with a microdilution method and the dilution-neutralization method (AFNOR T 72-150). The microdilution method results were validated using the MBCs of four reference strains tested with the dilution-neutralization method (AFNOR T 72-150). 3 disinfectants proved to be valuable. 1 disinfectant was valuable but with a MBC toward all bacteria only a dilution away from the dilution of use. 1 disinfectant was determined as unsatisfactory as 9.5 p. cent of all strains proved resistant toward it. All disinfectants matched AFNOR standards; but those specifications did not match toward hospital strains. Such an evaluation using a simple and reliable method should be of use.
TI  - Quality control of bacterial enumeration.
AB  - Standard bacterial suspensions can be used to assess test method performance, via control charts, and inhibition of recovery when analyzing water samples. Variability in standard suspensions prepared from different strains and species and the use of frozen environmental samples for quality control for spore and bacteriophage analyses are also discussed.
TI  - Purification and analysis of streptococcal NADH peroxidase expressed in Escherichia coli.
AB  - Using the T7 RNA polymerase expression system, a modified plasmid vector has been developed which gives reliable, high level expression in Escherichia coli of the gene encoding streptococcal NADH peroxidase. The recombinant enzyme has been purified to homogeneity using a revised protocol which yields over 35 mg of pure protein per liter of culture. Recombinant NADH peroxidase is fully active and exhibits spectroscopic and redox properties identical to those for the enzyme purified from Streptococcus faecalis 10C1. Reductive titrations and thiol analyses confirm the presence of the unusual cysteine-sulfenic acid (Cys-SOH) redox center identified previously. N-terminal sequence analysis, analytical gel filtration, and preliminary x-ray diffraction data all confirm the structural identity of the recombinant and S. faecalis enzymes. Steady-state kinetic analysis of the peroxidase, coupled with results from static titration experiments is consistent with a limiting type of ternary complex mechanism and allows the determination of many of the corresponding kinetic constants. In addition, preliminary 1H NMR spectra of the enzyme at millimolar concentrations show good dispersion in the amide region and indicate that the recombinant peroxidase is suitable for one-dimensional NMR work with labeled amino acids.
TI  - Neutralizing antibodies against the peptide antibiotic AS-48: immunocytological studies.
AB  - Antisera against the broad-spectrum peptide antibiotic AS-48 produced by Enterococcus faecalis were obtained from immunized rabbits. Appreciable antibody titers were obtained only after repeated immunization, suggesting a feeble antigenicity for AS-48. Upon incubation with AS-48, the antisera neutralized its bacteriolytic action on E. faecalis S-47, although the simultaneous addition of AS-48 and serum did not prevent lysis. Crude serum cross-reacted with outer envelope components of enterococci, although specific anti-AS-48 antibodies, purified by affinity chromatography, reacted only with AS-48-treated cells. Labelling with immunofluorescence and colloidal gold particles was carried out on sensitive and resistant bacterial species to determine the interaction of AS-48 with cell structures.
TI  - Effect of hyperbaric oxygen and surgery on experimental multimicrobial gas gangrene.
AB  - An experimental multimicrobial gas gangrene rat model was developed and the therapeutic effect of surgery was compared to the combined effect of surgery and hyperbaric oxygen (HBO). The infection was caused by an intramuscular injection of a mixture of bacteria including Clostridium perfringens, Bacteroides fragilis, Escherichia coli and Streptococcus faecalis. The mortality, morbidity and wound healing were assessed during a follow-up of 2 weeks. The mortality of the control rats was 60%, with rats treated with surgery alone 35% and the combined treatment group 20% (NS). In the combined treatment group, 84.4% of the survivors healed completely; the corresponding figure in the surgery group was 15.4% (p < 0.001). In experimental multimicrobial gas gangrene the addition of HBO to surgery reduces morbidity and improves wound healing but does not reduce mortality statistically significantly.
TI  - Characterization of Tn1546, a Tn3-related transposon conferring glycopeptide resistance by synthesis of depsipeptide peptidoglycan precursors in Enterococcus faecium BM4147.
AB  - Sequence determination of the flanking regions of the vancomycin resistance van gene cluster carried by pIP816 in Enterococcus faecium BM4147 revealed similarity to transposons of the Tn3 family. Imperfect inverted repeats (36 of 38 bp) delineated a 10,851-bp element designated Tn1546. The 4-kb region located upstream from the vanR gene contained two open reading frames (ORF) transcribed in opposite directions. The deduced amino acid sequence of ORF1 (988 residues) displayed, respectively, 56 and 42% identity to those of the transposases of Tn4430 from Bacillus thuringiensis and of Tn917 from Enterococcus faecalis. The product of ORF2 (191 residues) was related to the resolvase of Tn917 (33% amino acid identity) and to the Res protein (48%) of plasmid pIP404 from Clostridium perfringens. Tn1546 transposed consecutively in Escherichia coli from plasmid pUC18 into pOX38 and from pOX38 into various sites of pBR329. Transposition was replicative, led to the formation of cointegrates, and produced a 5-bp duplication at the target site. Southern hybridization and DNA amplification revealed the presence of Tn1546-related elements in enterococci highly resistant to glycopeptides. Analysis of sequences surrounding these elements indicated that transposition plays a role in dissemination of the van gene cluster among replicons of human clinical isolates of E. faecium.
TI  - Cytokine production by the human bladder carcinoma cell line T24 in the presence  of bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG).
AB  - The study was initiated as an in vitro approach to the situation existing during  intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) instillation in patients with superficial bladder cancer. Cytokine secretion of a human bladder carcinoma cell line T24 treated with BCG was investigated. A 24-h treatment of T24 cells with BCG resulted in a tenfold higher secretion of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) when compared with T24 cells treated with Escherichia coli, Streptococcus faecalis or a cell wall preparation of Nocardia rubra (N-CWS). No secretion of IL-1 beta and IL-2 was detected. Pre-exposing T24 cells to BCG for various periods of time indicated that a minimum exposure time of 0.5-1 h was required to upregulate IL-6 and TNF alpha production. Extending the BCG pre-exposure time to 2 and 3 h further increased the rate of cytokine production. No significant difference was found, however, between the rate of secretion initiated after a 2-h or 3-h pre-exposure period. The amounts of these cytokines secreted in the presence of BCG-conditioned medium did not differ significantly from the constitutively secreted amounts, excluding an effect of products possibly secreted by BCG on the upregulation of IL-6 and TNF alpha. In addition, upregulation of cytokine production appeared to be dependent on the concentration of BCG. The results suggest that cytokines may be produced by urothelial tumor cells after intravesical instillation in patients with superficial bladder cancer, which may play a role in the mode of action of BCG.
TI  - Characterization of the heat shock response in Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - We have characterized the general properties of the heat shock response of the Gram-positive hardy bacterium Enterococcus faecalis. The heat resistance (60 degrees C or 62.5 degrees C, 30 min) of log phase cells of E. faecalis grown at 37 degrees C was enhanced by exposing cells to a prior heat shock at 45 degrees C or 50 degrees C for 30 min. These conditioning temperatures also induced ethanol (22%, v/v) tolerance. The onset of thermotolerance was accompanied by the synthesis of a number of heat shock proteins. The most prominent bands had molecular weights in the range of 48 to 94kDa. By Western blot analysis two of them were found to be immunologically related to the well known DnaK (72kDa) and GroEL (63kDa) heat shock proteins of Escherichia coli. Four other proteins showing little or no variations after exposure to heat are related to DnaJ, GrpE and Lon (La) E. coli proteins and to the Bacillus subtilis sigma 43 factor. Ethanol (2% or 4%, v/v) treatments elicited a similar response although there was a weaker induction of heat shock proteins than with heat shock.
TI  - Cloning and sequencing of curA encoding curvacin A, the bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus curvatus LTH1174.
AB  - Curvacin A is a bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus curvatus LTH1174 which is a potential starter organism for the production of fermented dry sausages. This peptide inhibits the growth of the opportunistic food pathogens Listeria monocytogenes and Enterococcus faecalis and thus, curvacin A may enable better performance of a starter and improvement of the hygienic status of meat products. Oligonucleotides were constructed deduced from the peptide sequence and used for the identification of the curvacin A structural gene curA on a 60 kb plasmid of L. curvatus LTH1174. Plasmid-cured derivatives of this strain were unable to produce curvacin A but were still resistant to the bacteriocin. CurA was cloned into Escherichia coli NM554 and its nucleotide sequence was determined. Sequencing revealed the presence of an additional open reading frame of 51 amino acids with unknown function. A promoter was detected upstream of curA by primer extension. Both reading frames form a single transcript. Curvacin A is synthesised as a prepeptide of 59 amino acids which is proteolytically processed to the mature bacteriocin of 41 amino acids.
TI  - Antibacterial spectrum of lactoferricin B, a potent bactericidal peptide derived  from the N-terminal region of bovine lactoferrin.
AB  - A physiologically diverse range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria was found to be susceptible to inhibition and inactivation by lactoferricin B, a peptide produced by gastric pepsin digestion of bovine lactoferrin. The list of susceptible organisms includes Escherichia coli, Salmonella enteritidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Yersinia enterocolitica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Campylobacter jejuni, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Listeria monocytogenes and Clostridium perfringens. Concentrations of lactoferricin B required to cause complete inhibition of growth varied within the range of 0.3 to 150 micrograms/ml, depending on the strain and the culture medium used. The peptide showed activity against E. coli O111 over the range of pH 5.5 to 7.5 and was most effective under slightly alkaline conditions. Its antibacterial effectiveness was reduced in the presence of Na+, K+, Mg2+ or Ca2+ ions, or in the presence of various buffer salts. Lactoferricin B was lethal, causing a rapid loss of colony-forming capability in most of the species tested. Pseudomonas fluorescens, Enterococcus faecalis and Bifidobacterium bifidum strains were highly resistant to this peptide.
TI  - Microbial adhesion and biofilm formation on ureteral stents in vitro and in vivo.
AB  - Thirty ureteral stents, inserted for 5 to 128 days following extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy, were examined for the presence of bacterial biofilms. Of these, 90% had adherent pathogens (44% mixed organisms) on the stents, 45% of which were present in low numbers (10(1)-10(2) per 1 cm3 section) and 55% were in small and large microcolony biofilms (> 2 x 10(2)-10(7)). The organisms were recovered from the stents even though urine culture was only positive in 27% of patients. Of the organisms isolated, 77% were Gram positive cocci, 15% Gram negative rods and 8% Candida. No blockage of the stents occurred. All of the patients had received antimicrobial therapy post-insertion, and in 15 cases biofilms were found while on treatment. None of the patients received therapy for urinary tract infections while the stent remained in place. In vitro experiments demonstrated the ability of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis uropathogens to adhere and form biofilms on ureteral stents within 24 hours. Clearly, bacterial biofilms do occur on ureteral stents and urinary culture may not detect their presence. The high recovery rate of Gram positive organisms may indicate a preferential adhesion to the biomaterial surface. The findings also indicate that unlike biofilm formation on many other prosthetic implants, colonization with Gram positive organisms on ureteral stents does not necessarily coincide with the development symptomatic infection.
TI  - Tn5381, a conjugative transposon identifiable as a circular form in Enterococcus  faecalis.
AB  - We have identified two 19-kb conjugative transposons (Tn5381 and Tn5383) in separate strains of multiply resistant Enterococcus faecalis. These transposons confer resistance to tetracycline and minocycline via a tetM gene, are capable of both chromosomal and plasmid integration in a Rec- environment, and transfer between strains in the absence of detectable plasmid DNA at frequencies ranging from < 1 x 10(-9) to 2 x 10(-5) per donor CFU, depending on the donor strain and the growth conditions. Hybridization studies indicate that these transposons are closely related to Tn916. We have identified bands of ca. 19 kb on agarose gel separations of alkaline lysis preparations from E. faecalis strains containing chromosomal copies of Tn5381, which we have confirmed to be a circularized form of this transposon. This phenomenon has previously been observed only when Tn916 has been cloned in Escherichia coli. Overnight growth of donor strains in the presence of subinhibitory concentrations of tetracycline results in an approximately 10-fold increase in transfer frequency of Tn5381 into enterococcal recipients and an increase in the amount of the circular form of Tn5381 as detectable by hybridization. These results suggest that Tn5381 is a Tn916-related conjugative transposon for which the appearance of a circular form and the conjugative-transfer frequency are regulated by a mechanism(s) affected by the presence of tetracycline in the growth medium.
TI  - Vector construction, transformation, and gene amplification in Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824.
AB  - In order to alter the primary metabolism of C. acetobutylicum, we have constructed E. coli- or B. subtilis-C. acetobutylicum shuttle vectors that could be used to deliver homologous fermentative genes into C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824. The plasmid copy number and plasmid stability in C. acetobutylicum for several of these plasmids were determined. We have also developed a protocol for the electrotransformation of C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824. Difficulty in the transformation of C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824 with vectors containing DNA from E. coli plasmids was found to be due to the existence of a restriction system in this strain. This type II restriction endonuclease, named Cac824I, recognizes the sequence 5'-GCNGC-3' and cuts ColE1 plasmids frequently. One of the vectors, pFNK1, possessing a variety of unique cloning sites was used in the amplification of one acid (PTB) and one solvent (AADC) formation gene. The corresponding enzyme activities were amplified in C. acetobutylicum as shown by enzyme assays and SDS-PAGE gels of cell extracts.
TI  - Optimal method for culturing vascular prosthetic grafts.
AB  - Vascular prosthetic infection may be underrecognized when identified by standard  culture techniques. Improved microbiologic methodology may enhance detection of bacteria in prosthetic graft specimens, and thus may alter clinical decisions. Quantitative culture techniques were employed to compare three methods of enhancing bacterial recovery from Dacron graft cylinders seeded with commonly encountered bacterial pathogens. Methods included: (1) ultrasonic bath treatment, (2) direct ultrasonic disruption, and (3) agitation on a Vortex mixer. Ultrasonic bath treatment released bacteria with colony counts that were consistently greater by 1 log than direct ultrasonic disruption and Vortex agitation. Direct ultrasonic disruption at high energy levels selectively killed gram-negative bacteria by as much as a 4 log decrease in viable organisms. Agitation (Vortex mixing) of the specimen produced the lowest counts among the three methods tested. These data would indicate that a 5-min ultrasonic bath treatment was the optimal method of preparation of vascular prostheses for bacterial culture.
TI  - Molecular cloning and analysis of the gene encoding the NADH oxidase from Streptococcus faecalis 10C1. Comparison with NADH peroxidase and the flavoprotein disulfide reductases.
AB  - The gene encoding the streptococcal flavoprotein NADH oxidase (NOXase), which catalyzes the four-electron reduction of O2-->2H2O, has been cloned and sequenced from the genome of Streptococcus (Enterococcus) faecalis 10C1 (ATCC 11700). The deduced NOXase protein sequence corresponds to a molecular mass of 48.9 kDa and contains three previously sequenced cysteinyl peptides obtained with the purified enzyme. In Escherichia coli, the expressed nox gene produced a catalytically active product, which retained its immunoreactivity to affinity-purified NOXase antisera. Alignment of the NOXase protein sequence with that of streptococcal NADH peroxidase (NPXase) revealed that the proteins are 44% identical. Among the most highly conserved segments is a sequence containing Cys42; this residue is known to exist as a stabilized cysteine-sulfenic acid (Cys-SOH) in NPXase and serves as the non-flavin redox center. In addition, three previously identified NPXase segments, known to be involved in FAD and NAD(P)-binding in other pyridine nucleotide-linked flavoprotein oxidoreductases, are strongly conserved in NOXase. Overall, the extensive homology observed between NOXase and NPXase suggests that the monomer chain fold of the oxidase closely resembles that of the peroxidase. Both sequences share limited but significant homology to those of glutathione reductase and other members of the flavoprotein disulfide reductase family. These and other considerations suggest that these two unusual streptococcal flavoproteins constitute a distinct class of FAD-dependent oxidoreductases, the flavoprotein peroxide reductases, easily contrasted with enzymes such as glutathione reductase and thioredoxin reductase.
TI  - [Evaluation of in vitro antimicrobial activity of cefazolin alone and in combination with cefmetazole or flomoxef using agar dilution method and disk diffusion method].
AB  - Antimicrobial activities of cefazolin (CEZ) against 251 strains of various clinical isolates obtained during 1989 and 1990 were determined using the Mueller-Hinton agar dilution method at an inoculum level 10(6) CFU/ml. The reliability of the disk susceptility test was also studied using Mueller-Hinton agar and various disks at inoculum levels of 10(3-4) CFU/cm2 in estimating approximate values of MICs. In addition, antimicrobial activities of CEZ and cefmetazole (CMZ) or flomoxef (FMOX) in combination were investigated against methicillin-sensitive and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA and MRSA) using the checkerboard agar dilution MIC method and the disk diffusion test either with the disks contained CEZ, CMZ, and FMOX alone, or CEZ, and CMZ or FMOX in combination. In this study, the MICs of CEZ against S. aureus were distributed with the 3 peak values at 0.39 microgram/ml, 3.13 micrograms/ml and > 100 micrograms/ml. MICs against MSSA were 0.39 microgram/ml to 0.78 microgram/ml, whereas those against MRSA were greater than 0.78 microgram/ml. MICs against majority of strains of Enterococcus faecalis were 25 micrograms/ml. Over 90% of strains of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were inhibited at the level of 3.13 micrograms/ml. About 60% of isolates of indole negative Proteus spp. were inhibited at the levels of less than 3.13 micrograms/ml and 100% at 6.25 micrograms/ml, but MICs against indole positive Proteus spp., Serratia spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were over 100 micrograms/ml. The antimicrobial activities of CEZ against these clinical isolates were not significantly different compared to those reported about 15-20 years ago, except for S. aureus. Highly resistant strains of S. aureus to CEZ were more prevalent in this study. The inhibitory zones obtained with the disk test were compared with MICs. The results of CEZ disk susceptibility test with 30 micrograms disk (Showa) or 10 micrograms disk (prepared in this laboratory) were well correlated with MICs (r = -0.837 and -0.814, respectively), showing the reliavility of the disk method in estimating approximate values of MICs. In the 4 category classification system currently used in Japan, break points in MIC values proposed are () MIC < or = 3 micrograms/ml, (++) > 3-15 micrograms/ml, (+) > 15-60 micrograms/ml, (-) > 60 micrograms/ml. The results obtained with 30 micrograms disks showed false positive in 7.7% and false negative in 6.8% of the samples. The disk results with E. faecalis showed a higher ratio of false positive results.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - A descriptive analysis of urine cultures: pure versus mixed isolates.
AB  - Out of 5,670 urine cultures performed in 1989, 1,448 positive cultures with unique results were analyzed. Of these 1,448, 67% were pure cultures, and 50% had at least one isolate with a colony count greater than 100,000 colony forming units/ml. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and diphtheroids were more likely (p < 0.01) to occur in mixed than pure culture, while Escherichia coli was more likely to occur in pure than mixed culture. The most common organism combinations were diphtheroids-coagulase negative Staphylococcus (30 cultures), E. faecalis-coagulase negative Staphylococcus (28), E. faecalis-P. aeruginosa (13), K. pneumoniae-P. aeruginosa (9), and E. coli-P. aeruginosa (9).
TI  - Comparison of the gentamicin resistance transposon Tn5281 with regions encoding gentamicin resistance in Enterococcus faecalis isolates from diverse geographic locations.
AB  - The genetic determinant encoding gentamicin resistance (Gmr) on the beta-lactamase encoding plasmid pBEM10 of Enterococcus faecalis HH22 is carried on a transposon, termed Tn5281, that is highly related to the staphylococcal Gmr transposons Tn4001 found in Australian isolates of Staphylococcus aureus and Tn4031 found in United States isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis. We have now studied plasmid DNA from Gmr strains of E. faecalis isolated from diverse geographical locations (Houston, Pennsylvania, Thailand, and Chile) by using restriction endonuclease analysis and DNA-DNA hybridization to determine whether other Gmr E. faecalis carry Tn5281 or a similar type of element. We also compared these enterococci to several United States isolates of Staphylococcus aureus with nonmobile Gmr determinants. Three E. faecalis isolates (from Houston and Chile) carried Tn5281-like elements, whereas two isolates (from Houston and Pennsylvania) had restriction endonuclease and DNA-DNA hybridization patterns more similar to those of the Tn4001-IS257 hybrid found in the nonmobile Gmr determinants in United States isolates of S. aureus. A strain from Thailand had a third pattern unrelated to either Tn5281 or the nonmobile Gmr determinants present in United States isolates of S. aureus. Our results demonstrate that there is both similarity and diversity between the Gmr determinant of strains of E. faecalis isolated in diverse geographic locations.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of AM-1155, a new 6-fluoro-8-methoxy quinolone.
AB  - AM-1155 is a new quinolone with a wide spectrum of antibacterial activity against various bacteria including anaerobes and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. AM-1155 was 2- to 16-fold more active than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin against Staphylococcus aureus including methicillin-resistant strains, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Enterococcus faecalis; its MICs for 90% of strains tested were 0.10 to 0.78 micrograms/ml. The activity of AM-1155 was comparable to that of ciprofloxacin against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, but was fourfold less than that of ciprofloxacin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Against Xanthomonas maltophilia, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and Campylobacter jejuni, AM-1155 was two- to fourfold more active than ciprofloxacin. At a concentration of 1.56 micrograms/ml, AM-1155 inhibited 90% of Bacteroides fragilis strains tested; its activity was 8- to 10-fold higher than those of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. Development of resistance to AM-1155 in S. aureus and S. epidermidis occurred at a lower frequency than did that to ciprofloxacin after eight transfers in the presence of drug. In the oral treatment of mouse systemic infections, AM-1155 was four- to eightfold more effective than ciprofloxacin against gram-positive cocci and was as active as ciprofloxacin against gram-negative rods. The efficacy of an oral or a subcutaneous dose of AM-1155 was two- to fivefold greater than that of ofloxacin. Against experimental pneumonia with Klebsiella pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa, AM-1155 was two- to fourfold more active than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. AM-1155 also had good efficacy against mouse ascending urinary tract infections with Escherichia coli and P. aeruginosa. These results suggest that AM-1155 may be a potent antibacterial agent applicable to various infections.
TI  - Gene structure of Enterococcus hirae (Streptococcus faecalis) F1F0-ATPase, which  functions as a regulator of cytoplasmic pH.
AB  - Enterococcus hirae (formerly Streptococcus faecalis) ATCC 9790 has an F1F0-ATPase which functions as a regulator of the cytoplasmic pH but does not synthesize ATP. We isolated four clones which contained genes for c, b, delta, and alpha subunits of this enzyme but not for other subunit genes. It was revealed that two specific regions (upstream of the c-subunit gene and downstream of the gamma-subunit gene) were lost at a specific site in the clones we isolated, suggesting that these regions were unstable in Escherichia coli. The deleted regions were amplified by polymerase chain reaction, and the nucleotide sequences of these regions were determined. The results showed that eight genes for a, c, b, delta, alpha, gamma, beta, and epsilon subunits were present in this order. Northern (RNA) blot analysis showed that these eight genes were transcribed to one mRNA. The i gene was not found in the upper region of the a-subunit gene. Instead of the i gene, this operon contained a long untranslated region (240 bp) whose G + C content was only 30%. There was no typical promoter sequence such as was proposed for E. coli, suggesting that the promoter structure of this species is different from that of E. coli. Deduced amino acid sequences suggested that E. hirae H(+)-ATPase is a typical F1F0-type ATPase but that its gene structure is not identical to that of other bacterial F1F0-ATPases.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of genetic expression and secretion signals from Enterococcus faecalis through the use of broad-host-range alpha-amylase probe vectors.
AB  - We have constructed two broad-host-range Gram+/Gram- probe vectors designed for the cloning of bacterial genetic expression and secretion signals. These vectors make use of a silent reporter gene encoding the mature alpha-amylase from Bacillus licheniformis whose reactivation can easily be monitored on iodine-stained starch plates. Shotgun cloning of Enterococcus faecalis DNA fragments allowed recovery of several cassettes directing transcription, translation of the reporter gene and secretion of alpha-amylase. Sequence analysis revealed, in each case, the presence of a putative promoter, ribosome-binding site and signal peptide similar to those described in other Gram+ bacteria.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from urinary tract infections (1988). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - Isolation frequencies and sensitivities to antibacterial and antibiotic agents were investigated on 801 bacterial strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections in 9 hospitals during the period of June to November 1988. Of the above total bacterial population, Gram-positive bacteria accounted for 29.3% and a majority of them were Enterococcus spp. Gram-negative bacteria accounted for 70.7% and most of them were Escherichia coli. 1. Enterococcus faecalis: Vancomycin was most active with its MIC90 < or = 0.78 microgram/ml. Ampicillin, piperacillin, ofloxacin (OFLX), ciprofloxacin (CPFX) and imipenem (IPM) were also active. 2. Staphylococcus aureus: Arbekacin and minocycline were most active with their MIC90s 0.39 microgram/ml and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively. Among penicillins, dicloxacillin was the most active. Activities of cephems were considerably lower. 3. E. coli: Most of the agents were tested active. Particularly the second and third generation cephems were active in a range of < or = 0.10-0.20 microgram/ml. Carumonam (CRMN), IPM, OFLX and CPFX were also active with MIC90s < or = 0.10 microgram/ml. 4. Klebsiella pneumoniae CRMN and IPM were highly active. Penicillins generally showed lower activities. Cephems and new quinolones had high activities with their MIC90s in a range of 0.39-0.78 microgram/ml. 5. Proteus mirabilis: The third generation cephems were active with their MIC90s in a range of < or = 0.10-0.20 microgram/ml. CRMN, OFLX and CPFX were also active with their MIC90s < or = 0.10 microgram/ml, 0.39 microgram/ml and 0.20 microgram/ml, respectively. 6. Pseudomonas aeruginosa: IPM and tobramycin were active with their MIC90s 1.56 micrograms/ml and 3.13 micrograms/ml, respectively. CRMN and new quinolones showed MIC80s of 25-100 micrograms/ml. Most of penicillins and cephems were not active. 7. Other Gram-negative rods: Against Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae and Serratia marcescens, IPM, CPFX and OFLX were active. Penicillins and cephems were not so active. CRMN was active against S. marcescens with its MIC80 at 6.25 micrograms/ml.
TI  - In vitro activity of MC-352, a new 16-membered macrolide.
AB  - The in vitro activity of MC-352, 3,4'-dideoxy-5-O-mycaminosyltylonolide, was compared with those of erythromycin, clarithromycin, and rokitamycin. The MC-352 MIC90 (MIC for 90% of isolates) for erythromycin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis was less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, similar to those of the other agents. The MC-352 MIC50 for erythromycin-resistant S. aureus was 2 micrograms/ml, similar to that of rokitamycin. The MC-352 MIC90 (0.12 micrograms/ml) for Streptococcus pyogenes was similar to those of erythromycin and clarithromycin and superior to that of rokitamycin, and the MC-352 MIC90 for group B, C, and G streptococci was 0.25 microgram/ml. MC-352 and clarithromycin had an MIC90 of 0.12 microgram/ml for Streptococcus pneumoniae. Erythromycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis was inhibited by MC-352 at 1 microgram/ml, but the MIC for constitutively erythromycin-resistant isolates was greater than 16 micrograms/ml. Legionella pneumophila was inhibited by less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml. MC-352 was the most active agent against Bacteroides fragilis, with an MIC90 of 8 micrograms/ml, and was more active than the other agents against Haemophilus influenzae, with an MIC90 of 4 micrograms/ml. Moraxella spp. were inhibited by MC-352 at less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml. The MIC90 for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Salmonella, Shigella, Yersinia, Enterobacter, Citrobacter, and Serratia spp. was greater than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml. MC-352 was bactericidal for S. pyogenes and S. pneumoniae, and its activity was not altered by human serum.
TI  - Isolation and identification of intestinal bacteria from Japanese tree frog (Hlya japonica) with the special reference to anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The bacteria in the large intestines of eight Japanese tree frogs (Hlya japonica) were enumerated by using an anaerobic culture system. The microorganisms at approximately 3.1 x 10(9) bacteria per g (wet weight) of intestinal contents were present in the intestine of all the frogs tested. No difference of the total bacteria in the frog intestine was observed between two different incubation-temperatures (room temperature and 37 degrees C). Eleven genera and 16 species were isolated from the frog intestine. In most frogs, Bacteroides (B.) caccae and B. vulgatus were detected as the predominant organisms. Escherichia coli was also present in greater numbers in the intestine. Other bacteria isolated at high dilutions were strict anaerobes, including Fusobacterium and Clostridium. Enterococcus faecalis was frequently isolated from the frog intestine. However, four genera of Bifidobacterium, Eubacterium, Peptostreptococcus, and Lactobacillus were not isolated from the frog intestine.
TI  - Characterization of enterococcal isolates by restriction enzyme analysis of genomic DNA.
AB  - A restriction enzyme analysis (REA) of chromosomal DNA for the intra-species characterization of enterococci is reported. The DNA was extracted by a rapid method and digested with the restriction enzyme Sal I to provide a characteristic 'fingerprint' consisting of 10-20 bands in the 1.6-5.0 kb range. One hundred and eighty enterococcal isolates were examined; 5 were type strains, 15 from an out-patient clinic and 160 from a geographically isolated British Antarctic Survey Base. The epidemiologically unrelated out-patient clinic isolates gave readily distinguishable patterns, whereas isolates from the geographically isolated community showed evidence of colonization. This technique provided a highly discriminatory method of isolate characterization for Enterococcus faecalis, E. faecium and E. durans suitable for epidemiological studies. A sample of isolates were probed with 16 + 23 S ribosomal RNA from Escherichia coli. Discrimination between isolates was poorer than with REA, although good correlation was observed between the results of the two techniques.
TI  - Isolation, characterization, and nucleotide sequence of the Streptococcus mutans  mannitol-phosphate dehydrogenase gene and the mannitol-specific factor III gene of the phosphoenolpyruvate phosphotransferase system.
AB  - Streptococcus mutans, the causative agent of dental caries, utilizes carbohydrates by means of the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system (PTS). The PTS facilitates vectorial translocation of metabolizable carbohydrates to form the corresponding sugar-phosphates, which are subsequently converted to glycolytic intermediates. The PTS consists of both sugar-specific and sugar-independent components. Complementation of an Escherichia coli mtlD mutation with a streptococcal recombinant DNA library allowed isolation of the mannitol-1-phosphate dehydrogenase gene (mtlD) and the adjacent sugar-specific mannitol factor III gene (mtlF) from S. mutans. Subsequent transposon mutagenesis of the complementing DNA fragment with Tn5seq1 defined the region that encodes the mtlD-complementing activity, the streptococcal mtlD gene. Nucleotide sequence analysis of this region revealed two complete open reading frames (ORFs) from within the streptococcal mannitol PTS operon. One ORF encodes the mtlD gene product, a 43.0-kDa protein which exhibits similarity to the E. coli and Enterococcus faecalis mannitol-1-phosphate dehydrogenases. The second ORF encodes a 15.8-kDa protein which exhibits similarity to mannitol factor III proteins from several bacterial species. In vitro transcription-translation assays were used to produce proteins of the sizes predicted by the streptococcal ORFs. These data indicate that the S. mutans mannitol PTS utilizes an enzyme II-factor III complex similar to the mannitol system found in other gram-positive organisms, as opposed to that of E. coli, which utilizes an independent enzyme II system.
TI  - The bactericidal activity and postantibiotic effect of trospectomycin.
AB  - Trospectomycin sulfate (trospectomycin, TRS) is a novel, broad-spectrum, aminocyclitol antibiotic that is being developed clinically for the treatment of upper respiratory tract infections, bacterial vaginosis, pelvic inflammatory disease, and gonorrhea. This study investigated the bactericidal activity (by time-kill kinetics) and the postantibiotic effect (PAE) of TRS. Species-dependent bacteriostatic/bactericidal activity was observed for TRS; the antibiotic was bacteriostatic for Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, and Escherichia coli, and bactericidal for Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Bacteroides fragilis (one of two test strains). When TRS was tested at four times its minimum inhibitory concentration or at a maximum test concentration of 32 micrograms/ml, with a 1-hr exposure period, the following PAE values were recorded: S. epidermidis 30032, 1.8 hr, En. faecalis ATCC 29212, 1.6 hr, E. coli UC 311, 1.5 hr, E. coli UC 9451, 1.5 hr, H. influenzae 30063, greater than 4.0 hr, B. fragilis ATCC 25285, 5.2 hr, and B. fragilis UC 12199, 6.7 hr. The broad-spectrum PAE that was observed for TRS is somewhat unique compared with other antibiotics.
TI  - Influence of transient salivary flora on assessment of mutans streptococci level  by the "Strip mutans" method.
AB  - The Dentocult SM ("Strip mutans") method occasionally shows decoloration of broth and of colonies of mutans streptococci on the plastic strip, thereby making interpretation difficult. In an attempt to explain the phenomenon and to investigate the influence of the salivary flora on the "Strip mutans" method, a total of 46 subjects were sampled. Saliva was analyzed using the "Strip mutans" method and conventional plating techniques to identify mutans streptococci, enterococci, staphylococci, enteric bacteria, and yeasts. Approximately 85% of the "Strip mutans" scores coincided with the conventional MSB-plating method. Two samples showed decolored mutans streptococci colonies on the "Strip mutans" strip. Enterococcus spp. were present in the saliva of these test subjects and could grow in the "Strip mutans" broth. Enterococcus faecalis was able to induce the same type of decoloration under experimental pure culture conditions. Three "Strip mutans" samples showed small colonies of mutans streptococci, visible only under magnification (x 10-20). Staphylococcus epidermidis was present in these saliva samples and showed heavy growth in the broth. Under experimental pure culture conditions S. epidermidis also inhibited the growth of mutans streptococci to some extent.
TI  - Study on the influence of adsorbent substances against the antigen activity of inactivated orovaccines.
AB  - Specific IgAGM, IgA and IgG levels were evaluated in two groups of rabbits orally treated with inactivated vaccine consisting of Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis and with the same vaccine supplemented with charcoal and kaolin, respectively. The determinations demonstrated that charcoal and kaolin do not have a significant, negative effect on immunoresponses at the intestinal and hematic level after both medium (two-week) and prolonged (four-week) treatment.
TI  - Gadolinium ion inhibits loss of metabolites induced by osmotic shock and large stretch-activated channels in bacteria.
AB  - Bacteria subjected to a hypotonic osmotic shock lose internal ions and also metabolites, without lysis of the cells. We show that the presence in the shock medium, at submillimolar concentrations, of the ion gadolinium, recently shown to block stretch-activated channels in Xenopus oocytes [Yang, X.-C. & Sachs, F. (1989) Science 243, 1068-1071], was sufficient to inhibit shock-induced release of metabolites such as lactose and ATP in Escherichia coli and ATP in Streptococcus faecalis. Moreover, gadolinium was observed, in patch-clamp experiments, to inhibit the giant stretch-activated channels of E. coli, S. faecalis. and Bacillus subtilis. Taken together, these data suggest that stretch-activated channels are localized in the cytoplasmic membrane of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, where they control the efflux of osmotic solutes, thus probably playing a major role in the response to hypotonic osmotic shock.
TI  - Conjugative transposition of Tn916: the transposon int gene is required only in the donor.
AB  - Conjugative transposition of transposon Tn916 has been shown to proceed by excision of the transposon in the donor strain and insertion of this element in the recipient. This process requires the product of the transposon int gene. We report here the surprising finding that the int gene is required only in the donor during conjugative transposition. We find that Tn916 int-1, whose int gene has been inactivated by an insertion mutation, transposes when a complementing wild-type int gene is present only in the donor during mating. When the int+ gene is present in a plasmid and is expressed from the spac promoter, conjugative transposition is very inefficient. However, when the Int+ function is supplied from a coresident distantly linked Tn916 tra-641 mutant, which is defective in a function required for conjugation, efficient conjugative transposition of Tn916 int-1 occurs. This suggests either that Int is not required for integration of Tn916 in gram-positive bacteria or that the protein is transferred from the donor to the transconjugant during the mating event. When the nonconjugative plasmid pAT145 was present in the donor, it was rarely cotransferred with Tn916. This suggests that complete fusion of mating cells is not common during conjugative transposition.
TI  - Induction of nitric oxide synthase is a necessary precondition for expression of  tumor necrosis factor-independent tumoricidal activity by activated macrophages.
AB  - Various bacteria and bacterial products induce in pure, lymphocyte-free bone marrow-derived mononuclear phagocytes (BMMo) the generation of tumor necrosis factor, nitric oxide (NO) synthase, NO and nitrite (NO2-), the flow of L-arginine to citrulline, and tumoricidal activity. The flow of L-arginine to citrulline and formation of NO/NO2- on the one hand and expression of tumoricidal activity were not always closely related; however, these parameters were suppressed in a dose-dependent manner by the flavoprotein inhibitor, diphenyleneiodonium (DPI) and the L-arginine analogue, NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (NMMA). The findings support the concept of a central role of the NO synthase pathway in the generation of tumor necrosis factor-independent tumoricidal activity by activated macrophages but the exact conditions which enable the transfer of the lytic principle from the effector to the target cell remain to be elucidated.
TI  - [Studies of bacterial indicators for water pollution--growth of Escherichia coli  and enterococci in limited nutrient conditions].
AB  - Bacteria, that would be an ideal indicator for fecal contamination in environmental water, should not proliferate but at the same time should survive a little longer than enteropathogenic bacteria in the environmental water. While conventional methods have recommended Escherichia coli as an indicator, enterococci is recommended as a preferable indicator for the estimation of fecal contamination based on the following observation. The relationship between the specific growth rate of organism and the concentration of peptone was determined and the value of Ks, a parameter analogous to Michaelis-Menten constant, was estimated. Ks of Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium were 3.8, 11.1 and 12.5 mg/ml respectively, indicating that Escherichia coli will grow at lower concentration of peptone than enterococci. Escherichia coli also grew in human fecal suspension and in filtrated (0.22 microns) river water, and while in those conditions enterococci did not grow or survive longer than Escherichia coli, survival time was longer than for Salmonella typhi and Shigella sonnei. It appears that enterococci reflect more accurately actual fecal contamination.
TI  - Determination of the chromosomal size of three different strains of Enterococcus  faecalis and one strain of Enterococcus faecium.
AB  - Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis was used to determine the chromosomal size of three different strains of Enterococcus faecalis and one strain of Enterococcus faecium. The size determinations of OG1X, a strain of E. faecalis widely used in many laboratories for genetic studies, using Sma I, Not I, and Sfi I alone or in combination, ranged from 2,750 to 2,761 kb. Using the same enzymes as with OG1X, the size of HH-67, a plasmid-free clinical isolate of E. faecalis, was determined to be 2,170-2,288 kb and the size of JH2-2, an E. faecalis recipient strain, ranged from 2,008 to 2,135 kb. The size range generated for GE-1, a plasmid-free E. faecium strain, with the use of Sma I, Not I, and Apa I was 2,045-2,155 kb. Although OG1X differed in size from the other three enterococci, each individual enterococcal strain generated reproducible results in different experiments. However, for both E. faecalis OG1X and E. faecium GE-1, one of the enzymes used generated a considerably smaller molecular size than that generated by the other two enzymes. The discrepancy was due to visually undiscernible comigrating fragments, and serves to point out a potential source of error if fewer than two enzymes are used to size a genome. The size discrepancies were resolved by digesting individual fragments with a second enzyme. The molecular sizes of these enterococcal strains are larger than that recently reported for Campylobacter, smaller than that of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and similar (OG1X) or smaller (JH2-2, HH67, and GE-1) than the 2,819-kb reported for Streptococcus mutans.
TI  - Flavin-linked peroxide reductases: protein-sulfenic acids and the oxidative stress response.
AB  - Sequence analyses of the Streptococcus faecalis NADH peroxidase and the flavoprotein component of the Salmonella typhimurium alkyl hydroperoxide reductase indicate clear evolutionary links with members of the flavoprotein disulfide reductase family. However, chemical and spectroscopic evidence demonstrate that the non-flavin redox center in NADH peroxidase is an unusual stabilized cysteine-sulfenic acid (Cys-SOH) derivative, and not a cystine disulfide as found in the disulfide reductases. This redox-active element, when appropriately stabilized by the respective protein environment, appears to play key roles in both the catalytic and regulatory aspects of the bacterial response to oxidative stress.
TI  - Handwashing and disinfection of heavily contaminated hands--effective or ineffective?
AB  - Hands are among the principal vehicles for transfer of nosocomial pathogens in hospitals. Often, outbreaks of infection are thought to be caused by a lack of compliance with handwashing guidelines, rather than due to the inadequacy of the handwashing agents used. In this study the effectiveness of proper handwashing and the use of three different hand disinfectants: ethanol 70% (E), isopropanol 40% (I) and alcoholic chlorhexidine (70%) (AC) was compared using three volunteers whose fingertips were heavily contaminated with a succession of bacteria including: Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae. After each contamination, thorough handwashing and application of one disinfectant on the hands were performed three times. Fingerprint-samples were taken before and 1 min after application of the disinfectants. Thorough handwashing with an ordinary liquid soap ('Sterisol') did not reduce the confluent growth of bacteria on fingertips for any of the species used (197 examinations). Only AC had a significant effect on fingers heavily contaminated with S. aureus (126 examinations; AC compared with E and I; P less than 0.0002 and P less than 0.0002 respectively), but did not completely eradicate the bacteria. After contamination with Ent. cloacae (118 examinations), none of the three agents were particularly effective, but E and AC seemed to be somewhat more effective than I (P less than 0.0002 and P less than 0.01 respectively). When successive contamination was performed using all bacterial species, AC was the most effective decontaminant. However, Ent. cloacae was still present on the fingertips after 15 repeated courses of handwashing and applications of disinfectants. Bathing of hands in AC for 20s completely eradicated all bacteria from the hands. The study demonstrates that, when heavily contaminated, an ordinary handwashing followed by disinfectants is not enough to eradicate potentially pathogenic bacteria from the hands.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of a 1,8-naphthyridine quinolone, PD 131628.
AB  - A new 1,8-naphthyridine quinolone antimicrobial, PD131628, was found to be as, or more active than ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin against Escherichia coli and considerably more active than the two 4-quinolone agents against staphylococci in terms of both MIC and OBC (the optimum bactericidal concentration, at which the rate of kill is greatest). In common with ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, the rate of kill of PD131628 against Enterococcus faecalis was considerably slower than against the other three species tested. Bacterial protein synthesis, RNA synthesis and cell division were not required for the bactericidal activity of PD131628 against E. coli or the staphylococci, although the lethality of PD131628 in the absence of these activities was reduced.
TI  - Degenerate oligonucleotide primers for enzymatic amplification of recA sequences  from gram-positive bacteria and mycoplasmas.
AB  - RecA protein in gram-negative bacteria, especially in Escherichia coli, has been  extensively studied, but little is known about this key enzyme in other procaryotes. Described here are degenerate oligonucleotide primers that have been used to amplify by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) recA sequences from several gram-positive bacteria and mycoplasmas. The DNA sequences of recA PCR products from Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus mutans, Enterococcus faecalis, and Mycoplasma pulmonis were determined and compared. These data indicate that the M. pulmonis recA gene has diverged significantly from recA genes of other eubacteria. It should be possible to use cloned recA PCR products to construct recA mutants, thereby providing the means of elucidating homologous genetic recombination and DNA repair activities in these organisms.
TI  - Staphylococcal phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system: molecular cloning and nucleotide sequence of the Staphylococcus carnosus ptsI gene and expression and complementation studies of the gene product.
AB  - A digoxigenin-labeled DNA probe that was complementary to the gene ptsH and the beginning of the gene ptsI was used to clone a 3.2-kb HincII-BamHI restriction fragment containing the complete ptsI gene of Staphylococcus carnosus. The restriction fragment was cloned in the antisense orientation to the lac promoter in the low-copy-number vector pSU18. The nucleotide sequences of the ptsI gene, which encodes enzyme I (EC 2.7.3.9), and the corresponding flanking regions were determined. The primary translation product, derived from the nucleotide sequence, consists of 574 amino acids and has a calculated molecular weight of 63,369. Amino acid sequence comparison showed 47% similarity to enzyme I of Escherichia coli and 37% similarity to the enzyme I domain of the multiphosphoryl transfer protein of Rhodobacter capsulatus. The histidinyl residue at position 191 could be identified as the probable phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphorylation site of enzyme I of S. carnosus because of sequence homologies with the peptide sequences of enzyme I-active sites of Enterococcus faecalis and Lactococcus lactis. Several in vivo and in vitro complementation studies with the enzyme I ptsI genes of S. carnosus and the E. coli ptsI mutant JLT2 were carried out. The generation times and interaction between enzyme I with histidine-containing protein from gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria were measured in a phosphoryl group transfer test.
TI  - Characterization of the tet(M) determinant of Tn916: evidence for regulation by transcription attenuation.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of the tetracycline resistance determinant tet(M), located on conjugative transposon Tn916 of Enterococcus faecalis, was determined and found to encode a 72,486-dalton protein exhibiting a high degree of homology with other tet(M) determinants. A short open reading frame corresponding to a 28-amino-acid peptide and containing a number of inverted repeat sequences was noted immediately upstream of tet(M), suggesting that regulation might occur by a mechanism involving transcriptional attenuation. Transcription analyses found this to indeed be the case, showing that the expression of tet(M) resulted from an extension of a small transcript representing the upstream leader region into the resistance determinant. Exposure of cells to tetracycline resulted in a significant increase in the amount of tet(M) transcription; this increase could be explained on the basis of increased transcriptional read-through from the upstream transcript. A model suggesting how transcriptional attenuation might operate in this system is presented.
TI  - D-alanine: D-alanine ligase of Escherichia coli. Expression, purification and inhibitory studies on the cloned enzyme.
AB  - A 1.2 kb BamHI fragment from pDK30 [Robinson, Kenan, Sweeney & Donachie (1986) J. Bacteriol. 167, 809-817] was cloned in pDOC55 [O'Connor & Timmis (1987) J. Bacteriol. 169, 4457-4482] to give two constructs, pDOC89 and pDOC87, in which the Escherichia coli D-alanine:D-alanine ligase (EC 6.3.2.4) gene (ddl) was placed under the control of the lac and lambda PL promoters respectively. Both constructs, when used to transform E. coli M72, gave similar levels of expression of the ddl gene. The expressed enzyme was purified to homogeneity and the amino acid sequence of its N-terminal region was found to be consistent with that predicted from the gene sequence, except that the N-terminal methionine was not present in the mature protein. [1(S)-Aminoethyl][(2RS)2-carboxy-1-octyl]phosphinic acid (I), previously shown to bind tightly to Enterococcus faecalis and Salmonella typhimurium D-alanine:D-alanine ligases following phosphorylation Parsons, Patchett, Bull, Schoen, Taub, Davidson, Combs, Springer, Gadebusch, Weissberger, Valiant, Mellin & Busch (1988) J. Med. Chem. 31, 1772-1778; Duncan & Walsh (1988) Biochemistry 27, 3709-3714], was found to be a classical slow-binding inhibitor of the E. coli ligase.
TI  - Cloning and disruption of a putative NaH-antiporter gene of Enterococcus hirae.
AB  - When growing in a sodium-rich environment, wild-type Enterococcus hirae extrudes  sodium by two mechanisms, ATP-driven sodium extrusion, and NaH-antiport. Mutant 7683 is unable to grow on sodium-rich media. This is due to two mutations, one inactivating ATP-driven sodium transport and a second rendering NaH-antiport inoperative. 7683 was transformed by electroporation with a gene bank, derived from E. hirae, in an Escherichia coli-E. hirae shuttle vector. Transformants which had regained the ability to grow on sodium-rich media were selected for and the transforming plasmids analyzed. A gene able to restore NaH-antiport activity in 7683 was identified. This gene was named napA. It codes for an extremely hydrophobic protein of 383 amino acids. Hydropathy analysis of this protein indicates that it probably forms 12 transmembraneous helices. In a mutant, possessing only the NaH-antiporter, the napA gene was disrupted by homologous recombination. The resultant strain failed to grow in sodium-rich media, and vesicles isolated from these cells exhibited a defect in sodium proton antiport activity. We conclude that the napA gene codes for a NaH-antiporter. The NapA protein does not exhibit significant homology to any protein in the EMBL genetic data bank.
TI  - Characterization of culturability, protistan grazing, and death of enteric bacteria in aquatic ecosystems.
AB  - Nonstained bacteria (NSB), rhodamine-stained bacteria (RSB), and fluorescence-labeled bacteria (FLB) were prepared from two enteric bacterial species, Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis. Counts of CFU of NSB and RSB and total numbers of RSB and FLB were monitored over time, both in the presence and in the absence of natural microbiota. In the presence of natural microbiota, no differences were observed between CFU counts of NSB and RSB, but RSB total numbers were 1 to 4 orders of magnitude higher than CFU numbers. Therefore, the use of standard bacteriological media causes an important underestimation of the total number of enteric bacteria. In the absence of natural microbiota, the total numbers of NSB, RSB, and FLB remained constant over time. These results showed that RSB are a reliable indicator of the decay in both the total number and the CFU of enteric bacteria in natural water samples. By using RSB, enteric bacteria were classified as culturable cells, nonculturable cells (or somnicells), and dead cells in the presence of natural microbiota. In the presence of natural microbiota, differences between RSB and FLB direct counts were detected for E. coli, but not for E. faecalis. These differences were explained by size-selective grazing. Thus, protistan grazing was found to be the main cause of the decrease in total numbers of enteric bacteria in our experiments.
TI  - Detection by ELISA of low numbers of Shiga-like toxin-producing Escherichia coli  in mixed cultures after growth in the presence of mitomycin C.
AB  - Techniques currently available to detect Shiga-like toxin (SLT)-producing Escherichia coli lack sensitivity or require specialised equipment and facilities, and in some cases detect only strains belonging to serotype O157. We have used an ELISA technique, capable of detecting both SLTI and SLTII with crude P1 glycoprotein from hydatid cysts, in combination with enhancement of toxin production by culture with mitomycin C. Supernates of Tryptone Soya Broth cultures containing mitomycin C 200 ng/ml were tested for SLTII. For SLTI, cell lysates pre-treated with polymyxin B were tested. In tests with E. coli O157:H7 in mixed culture with E. coli strain C600 alone, or with E. coli C600, Proteus mirabilis and Enterococcus faecalis, SLTI could be detected when the proportion of toxigenic organisms represented 1% of the mixture, and SLTII when the proportion was 0.025%. When faecal samples with added E. coli O157:H7 were examined in this system, SLTII-producing strains were detected when they comprised less than 0.1% of the coliform population. This technique is a sensitive and specific assay for detecting low numbers of SLT-producing organisms in mixed culture such as occurs in cases of haemolytic uraemic syndrome and haemorrhagic colitis.
TI  - [Antimicrobial and membranolytic activities of anti-burn drug fenozan].
AB  - Fenozan, an anti-burn preparation, was shown to have antimicrobial activity against freshly isolated clinical strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis, as well as against collection strains of the other gram-positive bacteria. The antimicrobial action of the preparation was possibly due to impairment of permeability of the cytoplasmic membranes in the sensitive bacterial cells and their liberation of intracellular low molecular weight compounds to the environment. The membranolytic and minimum inhibitory concentrations of fenozan with respect to the sensitive bacterial cells were one order of magnitude lower than the concentration stabilizing the membranes of animal cells in the treatment of burns. Combination of the antioxidant and antimicrobial properties in fenozan was likely to provide its satisfactory therapeutic effect in the treatment of burn wounds.
TI  - Conjugal transfer of plasmid DNA from Enterococcus faecalis to Escherichia coli in digestive tracts of gnotobiotic mice.
AB  - We have studied the transfer of the conjugative shuttle plasmid pAT191, which confers resistance to kanamycin, from Enterococcus faecalis to Escherichia coli in the digestive tracts of six gnotobiotic mice. Colonies of E. coli resistant to kanamycin were isolated from the feces of two mice, respectively, on days 25 and 35 after the beginning of the experiment and never thereafter. The transfer frequency of pAT191, expressed as the number of transconjugants per donor cell isolated from intestines of sacrificed mice, was 3 x 10(-9). These results indicate that conjugation is a mechanism that could account for the resistance gene flux from gram-positive to gram-negative bacteria observed in nature.
TI  - The influence of temperature on the behaviour of mixed bacterial contamination of the shell membrane of the hen's egg.
AB  - The inner membrane of the air cell of hens' eggs was inoculated with Pseudomonas  putida, Staphylococcus xylosus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli and Salmonella enteritidis. The first mentioned eventually dominated the contamination of the albumen of eggs stored at 4, 15, and 20 degrees C. The last mentioned did so in eggs stored at 37 degrees C. The interval between inoculation of the membrane and gross contamination of the albumen was markedly influenced by site of contamination relative to yolk movement.
TI  - Quantitative separation of bacteria in saline solution using lanthanide Er(III) and a magnetic field.
AB  - A trivalent lanthanide ion, erbium (Er3+), has been used in combination with a magnetic separation technique to isolate seven bacterial species from suspensions in 0.9% saline. Erbium has an exceptionally high atomic magnetic moment of 9.3 Bohr magnetons, and following addition as ErCl3 (final concentration 5 mM) to bacterial suspensions, it imparts the magnetic moment to the bacterial cells by ionic binding to the cell surface. Strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus and Enterococcus faecalis were obtained from the Quality Control Depository of The Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, Ohio, USA as suspensions in 0.9% NaCl, in concentrations ranging from 10(2) to 10(8) c.f.u. ml-1. Bacteria were separated from solution inside a capillary flow cell exposed to a highly non-homogeneous magnetic field (maximum field intensity was 0.4 T) and quantified by a light scattering method. The quantity of cellular deposition in the magnetic field was correlated with the initial concentration of cells in the suspension, expressed in c.f.u. ml-1, and sample volume (1.5 and 3.0 ml), sample pH (prior to ErCl3 addition), affinity to Gram stain (negative vs positive) and species.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - The effect of isolated high-energy shock wave treatments on subsequent bacterial  growth.
AB  - To determine whether high-energy shock waves possess bactericidal potential, ATCC strains of Escherichia coli, Streptococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus were suspended in solution at concentrations approximating 10(6) bacteria per milliliter, placed in polypropylene cryovials, and immersed in the water bath of a Dornier HM3 lithotriptor. Each cryovial was then fluoroscopically guided to the epicenter of the f2 focal point and 2000 shocks at 20 kV applied. Suspensions were then serially diluted and colony counts obtained. The procedure was then repeated with 4000 shocks at 20 kV from the Dornier HM3 and 4000 shocks at intensity level 4 from a Wolff Piezolith 2200 shock wave lithotriptor. Comparison of shock-wave-treated and sham-treated bacterial suspensions revealed no significant difference in bacterial growth according to the colony count technique. We conclude that high-energy shock waves, whether generated by spark gap or piezoelectric array, do not possess significant bactericidal activity.
TI  - In vitro activity of cefodizime.
AB  - Cefodizime is a bactericidal cephem with the typical broad spectrum activity of an aminothiazolyl cephalosporin, including both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria: its MIC90 is 0.125 mg/l for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and other streptococci; and 0.05 mg/l for Haemophilus spp., Neisseria meningitidis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Moraxella catarrhalis; while beta-lactamase positive strains of M. catarrhalis require 1 mg/l. Less than 1 mg/l is needed for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus spp. and Shigella spp. The MIC90 is 4 mg/l for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, Morganella morganii, Providencia spp. and most strains of Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter spp. and Enterobacter spp. Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis and most strains of Pseudomonas spp. and Acinetobacter spp. are considered cefodizime-resistant. Cefodizime is unaffected by plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases, but it is hydrolyzed by some chromosomally mediated enzymes, thus resembling other third-generation cephalosporins. Cefodizime has high affinity for PBP 3 and PBP IA and IB (Escherichia coli); in S. aureus it shows the highest affinity for PBP 1.
TI  - [The influence of cefdinir on the intestinal bacterial flora].
AB  - The influence of cefdinir (CFDN), a new oral cephalosporin, on the intestinal bacterial flora was studied in tetra-contaminated mice and in pediatric patients. CFDN in fine granules was administered at a dose of 10 mg/kg once a day for 5 consecutive days to mice contaminated with 4 different species of organism: Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacteroides fragilis and Bifidobacterium breve. No remarkable changes were observed in the fecal viable cell counts except that decreases in E. coli counts were observed on the day 3 to 5 after starting administration. The subjects in pediatric study were 7 children with infections, 3 boys and 4 girls, with their ages from 6 months to 12 years 7 months. Their body weights ranged from 5.5 to 29.2 kg. CFDN fine granules was administered at each dose of 3.0 mg/kg to 3.7 mg/kg, 3 times a day for 4 to 14 days. During the administration of CFDN, some variations were observed in the pattern of changes in the fecal bacterial flora between subjects. Although Enterobacteriaceae and total counts of anaerobes were markedly decreased in 2 cases, total counts of aerobes were unchanged in the 2 cases, whereas main aerobes and anaerobes except enterococci hardly varied in the other cases. There was no case in which glucose non-fermenting Gram-negative rods and fungi became predominant species continually. Although Clostridium difficile and C. difficile D-1 antigens were detected in 1 and 4 cases, respectively, no relationship was found between the number of C. difficile and the characteristics of the feces. With regard to the drug sensitivities of bacteria isolated from feces before and after administration of CFDN, higher levels of resistance were found in some bacteria such as Enterococcus and Bacteroides during or after administration than before administration. CFDN was detected in fecal samples from 2 cases during administration with concentrations ranging between 0.99-254 micrograms/g. High value of CFDN was found in a case with low beta-lactamase activity in feces, in which marked decrease of Enterobacteriaceae and total counts of anaerobes was observed. The above results suggest that CFDN is considered to be a drug with relatively small influence on the intestinal bacterial flora. But as high concentrations of drugs were detected in feces under some circumstances, our attention will be required. Particular care is also required for the occurrence of diarrhea and microbial replacement during continuous, long-term administration of the drug.
TI  - Antibacterial activity and mutagenicity studies of water-soluble phosphazene high polymers.
AB  - Eight water-soluble phosphazene high polymers, [NPR2]n (R, organic, water-solubilizing side-group; n, approx: 15,000) and the small-molecule counterparts of the polymers were examined for antibacterial activity against six different strains of bacteria (Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium (TA 100), Salmonella pullorum, Streptococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Antibacterial testing was carried out by measuring zones of inhibition and changes in solution turbidity over time. In addition, the antibacterial activity of the surfaces of cross-linked poly[di(methoxyethoxyethoxy)phosphazene] (MEEP) hydrogels were investigated. A number of the high polymers, as well as the MEEP hydrogels, impeded bacterial growth. Only E. coli was unaffected by the phosphazenes. A possible explanation for the antibacterial character of the polymers is presented. The same compounds were monitored for potential mutagenic activity using the Salmonella typhimurium tester strains TA 100 and TA 98. None of the high polymers or their small-molecule analogues showed mutagenic activity in either strain of Salmonella at the concentrations tested. The use of these materials as coatings for artificial implants is discussed.
TI  - Molecular and genetic analysis of a region of plasmid pCF10 containing positive control genes and structural genes encoding surface proteins involved in pheromone-inducible conjugation in Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - Exposure of Enterococcus faecalis cells carrying the tetracycline resistance plasmid pCF10 to the heptapeptide pheromone cCF10 results in an increase in conjugal transfer frequency by as much as 10(6)-fold. Pheromone-induced donor cells also express at least two plasmid-encoded surface proteins, the 130-kDa Sec 10 protein, which is involved in surface exclusion, and the 150-kDa Asc10 protein, which has been associated with the formation of mating aggregates. Previous subcloning and transposon mutagenesis studies indicated that the adjacent EcoRI c (7.5 kb) and e (4.5 kb) fragments of pCF10 encode the structural genes for these proteins and that the EcoRI c fragment also encodes at least two regulatory genes involved in activation of the expression of the genes encoding Asc10 and Sec10. In this paper, the results of physical and genetic analysis of this region of pCF10, along with the complete DNA sequences of the EcoRI c and e fragments, are reported. The results of the genetic studies indicate the location of the structural genes for the surface proteins and reveal important features of their transcription. In addition, we provide evidence here and in the accompanying paper (S. B. Olmsted, S.-M. Kao, L. J. van Putte, J. C. Gallo, and G. M. Dunny, J. Bacteriol. 173:7665-7672, 1991) for a role of Asc10 in mating aggregate formation. The data also reveal a complex positive control system that acts at distances of at least 3 to 6 kb to activate expression of Asc10. DNA sequence analysis presented here reveals the positions of a number of specific genes, termed prg (pheromone-responsive genes) in this region of pCF10. The genes mapped include prgA (encoding Sec10) and prgB (encoding Asc10), as well as four putative regulatory genes, prgX, -R, -S, and -T. Although the predicted amino acid sequences of Sec10 and Asc10 have some structural features in common with a number of surface proteins of gram-positive cocci, and the Asc10 sequence is highly similar to that of a similar protein encoded by the pheromone-inducible plasmid pAD1 (D. Galli, F. Lottspeich, and R. Wirth, Mol. Microbiol. 4:895-904, 1990), the regulatory genes show relatively little resemblance to any previously sequenced genes from either procaryotes or eucaryotes.
TI  - Localization of translocating Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Enterococcus faecalis within cecal and colonic tissues of monoassociated mice.
AB  - Normal bacteria can translocate (migrate) across an intact intestinal mucosa, but the anatomical site of bacterial translocation has not been defined. Gastrointestinal (GI) cross-sections were obtained from mice monoassociated with high cecal concentrations of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, or Enterococcus faecalis. As previously reported (C. L. Wells, R. P. Jechorek, and K. J. Gillingham, Arch. Surg. 126:247-252, 1991), these mice had viable translocating bacteria recovered from mesenteric lymph nodes and livers. No abnormal GI histology was noted. Immunofluorescence was used to localize GI bacteria, and similar observations were made with each of the three bacterial species. Smaller numbers (P less than 0.01) of bacteria were observed in stomach and small intestinal tissues than in cecal and colonic tissues, suggesting that the preferred site of tissue penetration for intestinal E. coli, P. mirabilis, and E. faecalis might be the cecum or colon as opposed to the stomach or small intestine.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents, 1989. A study mainly focused on imipenem. The Research Group for Testing Imipenem Susceptibilities of Clinical Isolates].
AB  - We investigated susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (IPM) and other antimicrobial agents at hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1989. The susceptibility testing was carried out according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc technique in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: (+++), (++), (+) and (-). IPM showed markedly high in vitro activities against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Bacteroides fragilis and had rather strong activities against Enterococcus faecalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Achromobacter xylosoxidans, but was less active to Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci and Xanthomonas maltophilia. IPM has been found to have activities superior to those of other antibiotics tested against E. faecalis, E. cloacae, C. freundii, S. marcescens, P. aeruginosa and B. fragilis. No antibiotics tested showed good activities against MRSA except minocycline.
TI  - The killing activity of microwaves on some non-sporogenic and sporogenic medically important bacterial strains.
AB  - The killing activity of microwaves of 2450 MHz frequency and 325 W, 650 W and 1400 W power on some bacterial strains was investigated. Vegetative strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes Group A, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus faecalis and spores of Bacillus subtilis and Bacillis stearothermophilus in aqueous suspensions were exposed to 325 W and 650 W waves for different lengths of time. Enterococcus faecalis and spores of B. subtilis and B. stearothermophilus were exposed additionally to 1400 W waves in aqueous and 'dried' suspensions. Vegetative bacteria were promptly killed in 5 min or less, E. faecalis being slightly more resistant. Bacterial spores were only killed in aqueous suspension when a 1400 W setting was used for 10 to 20 min. Bacterial spores adhering to the tube walls after the aqueous suspension was poured out were reduced in number. We assume that the conventional microwave ovens available on the market may be used for a high level of disinfection but not for sterilization, and only then if sufficient water is present.
TI  - A host factor absent from Lactococcus lactis subspecies lactis MG1363 is required for conjugative transposition.
AB  - In matings between Lactococcus lactis strains, the conjugative transposons Tn916  and Tn919 are found in the chromosome of the transconjugants in the same place as in the chromosome of the donor, indicating that no transposition has occurred. In agreement with this, the frequency of L. lactis transconjugants from intraspecies matings is the same whether the donor contains the wild-type form of the transposon or the mutant Tn916-int1, which has an insertion in the transposon's integrase gene. However, in intergeneric crosses with Bacillus subtilis or Enterococcus faecalis donors, Tn916 and Tn919 transpose to different locations on the chromosome of the L. lactis transconjugants. Moreover, Tn916 and Tn919 could not be transferred by conjugation from L. lactis and B. subtilis, E. faecalis or Streptococcus pyogenes. This suggests that excision of these elements does not occur in L. lactis. When cloned into E. coli with adjacent chromosomal DNA from L. lactis, the conjugative transposons were able to excise, transpose and promote conjugation. Therefore, the inability of these elements to excise in L. lactis is not caused by a permanent structural alteration in the transposon. We conclude that L. lactis lacks a factor required for excision of conjugative transposons.
TI  - Interaction of imipenem with erythromycin and tetracycline assessed by microdilution checkerboard techniques.
AB  - Microdilution methodology was used to study the interaction of imipenem with erythromycin and tetracycline, a combination therapy that might be used for the treatment of serious pelvic inflammatory disease. The combination of imipenem and erythromycin showed no antagonism for Escherichia coli and Haemophilus influenzae but was antagonistic for Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, and group B streptococci; the combination of imipenem and tetracycline was antagonistic for all strains except H. influenzae. Correlation between the results of kill curves and the measurement of fractional bactericidal concentration (FBC) indices was good, although FBC indices showed less antagonism than kill curves. Fractional inhibitory concentration indices showed poor correlation, rarely showing antagonism, and indeed showed synergy in three cases. If erythromycin or tetracycline is considered necessary in addition to imipenem in the treatment of pelvic inflammatory disease, it is probably more effective when given after the course of imipenem has been completed.
TI  - The bacteriology of cholelithiasis--China versus Japan.
AB  - Cholelithiasis differs considerably from area to area in the world. Calcium bilirubinate stones or brown pigment stones are said to predominate in the Orient, however, this situation may differ within the Orient. In order to compare cases in China and Japan, 102 consecutive cases of cholelithiasis operated on in Shenyang, China were analyzed for the composition of gallstones and bacterial species isolated from bile in relation to the location and composition of gallstones. In Shenyang, calcium bilirubinate stones predominated, occurring in 49.0 per cent of the cholelithiasis cases. This was much higher than in Japan, which had 17.5 per cent. The incidence of bacteria was also very high, ranging from 20 to 96 per cent, with an average of 66.7 per cent depending on the kind of gallstone present. Bacterial species possessing beta-glucuronidase activity were present in nearly all the cases of calcium bilirubinate stones (92.0 per cent). The incidence of bacteria with beta-glucuronidase activity especially of E. coli was much higher than in Japan (50.8 per cent versus 21.8 per cent) in concordance with the higher incidence of calcium bilirubinate stones in China (49.0 versus 17.5 per cent).
TI  - Inability of cephalothin testing to predict cefprozil susceptibility.
AB  - The 30-micrograms cefprozil disk and the cephalosporin class (30-micrograms cephalothin) disk were compared for their abilities to predict cefprozil susceptibility by agar disk diffusion testing. High error (5.02% major and 14.11% minor) rates were encountered with the cephalothin disk and were most frequently observed for Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis. The cefprozil disks resulted in rates of 0.05% very major, 0% major, and 3.72% minor errors. Thus, the 30-micrograms cefprozil disk is more desirable for predicting cefprozil susceptibility.
TI  - Characterization of a region of the Enterococcus faecalis plasmid pAM beta 1 which enhances the segregational stability of pAM beta 1-derived cloning vectors in Bacillus subtilis.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of a 2.13-kb EcoRI-HindIII, pAM beta 1-derived fragment,  isolated from the gram-positive cloning vector pHV1431, has been determined and shown to encode two ORFs. ORF H encodes for a protein of 23,930 Da which exhibits substantial homology to bacterial site-specific recombinases, particularly the resolvases of the gram-positive transposons Tn917 (30.3% identity) and Tn552 (31.6% identity) and the clostridial plasmid pIP404 (27.1% identity). The second ORF (I) is incomplete and encodes a polypeptide which has significant homology with Escherichia coli topoisomerase I (26.0% identity). Insertion of either the entire 2.13-kb EcoRI-HindIII fragment or a 0.73-kb EcoRI-DraI subfragment encoding only the resolvase into the pAM beta 1-based cloning vector pMTL500E causes a significant enhancement of segregational stability (from 6.5 X 10(-2) to 3.0-4.0 X 10(-3) plasmid loss per cell per generation). Improved segregational stability is mirrored by a reduction in plasmid polymerization. The introduction of a stop codon into the resolvase coding region negates its ability to promote segregational stability. It is proposed that the identified determinant stabilizes pAM beta 1-based vectors in Bacillus subtilis by maintaining the plasmid population in the monomeric state, thereby reducing the chances of producing plasmid-free segregants.
TI  - Conjugative transfer of Tn916 in Enterococcus faecalis: trans activation of homologous transposons.
AB  - Tn916 [carries tet(M)] is a 16.4-kb conjugative transposon that can establish itself in multiple copies in Enterococcus faecalis. To study the interaction of coresident homologous transposons during conjugation, an E. faecalis mutant defective in homologous recombination was utilized for construction of strains harboring Tn916 delta E (a derivative in which erm is substituted for tet) on the chromosome and Tn916 on a nonconjugative plasmid. When these strains were used as donors, the two transposons were able to transfer independently; however, they were found to transfer and become coestablished in the recipient up to 50% of the time. In contrast, cotransfer of a plasmid marker located outside the transposon occurred at a frequency of no greater than 0.5%. Separate experiments showed that mobilization of the nonconjugative plasmids pAM401 and pVA749 by chromosome-borne copies of Tn916 occurred only at low frequencies (generally less than 2% cotransfer). The data imply that the initiation of transposition of Tn916 results in a trans activation that is specific for homologous transposons present in the same cell.
TI  - Cloning, sequence and overexpression of NADH peroxidase from Streptococcus faecalis 10C1. Structural relationship with the flavoprotein disulfide reductases.
AB  - DNA fragments encoding streptococcal NADH peroxidase (NPXase) have been amplified, cloned and sequenced from the genome of Streptococcus (Enterococcus) faecalis 10C1 (ATCC 11700). The NPXase gene (npr) comprises 1341 base-pairs and is preceded by a typical ribosome binding site. Upstream from the structural gene, putative -10 and -35 promoter regions have been identified, as has a possible factor-independent terminator that occurs in 3'-flanking sequences. The deduced relative molecular mass (Mr = 49,551), amino acid composition and isoelectric point of NPXase are in good agreement with previous values obtained with the purified enzyme. In addition, three sequenced peptides totaling approximately 20% of the protein were located in the npr gene product. From the sequencing data the deduced NPXase sequence shares low but significant homology with the flavoprotein disulfide reductase class of enzymes ranging from 21% for glutathione reductase (GRase) to 28% for thioredoxin reductase. Alignment of NPXase to Escherichia coli GRase allowed the identification of three previously reported fingerprints for the FAD, NADP+ and central domains of GRase, in the peroxidase sequence. In addition, Cys42 of NPXase, which is present as an unusual stabilized cysteine-sulfenic acid in the oxidized enzyme, aligns favorably with the charge-transfer cysteine in E. coli GRase, and both residues closely follow FAD-binding folds found near their respective amino termini. Such sequence characteristics can also be seen in mercuric reductase, lipoamide dehydrogenase and trypanothione reductase, suggesting that all these enzymes may have originally diverged from a common ancestor. Sequences that are on average 50% identical with three previously reported peptides of the related streptococcal NADH oxidase were also identified in the NPXase primary structure, suggesting a strong similarity between these flavoenzymes. Using the E. coli phage T7 expression system the npr gene has now been overexpressed in an E. coli genetic background. The resultant overexpressing clone produced a recombinant NPXase that was catalytically active and immunoreactive to NPXase antisera.
TI  - Synergy and cumulated killing effect of the penems FCE 22101 and FCE 25199 in combination with gentamicin against bacteria isolated from septicaemia.
AB  - Blood isolates of Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus sanguis, Staphylococcus aureus, E. coli and Klebsiella oxytoca were tested for their synergistic and cumulated killing effect (CKE) with the new penems FCE 22101 or FCE 25199 in combination with gentamicin. The tissue cage model in rabbits was used to study the CKE in vivo after antibiotic treatment of the bacteria in vitro. Synergy was observed within two to seven h with all isolates in early logarithmic phase, except with S. aureus, which was rapidly killed by the penems alone. After one h treatment with the antibiotic combinations in vitro, a CKE was demonstrated for up to six h both in vitro and in vivo. The magnitude of the CKE differed between strains and in vitro vs. in vivo.
TI  - An integrative vector exploiting the transposition properties of Tn1545 for insertional mutagenesis and cloning of genes from gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - We have constructed and used an integrative vector, pAT112, that takes advantage  of the transposition properties (integration and excision) of transposon Tn1545. This 4.9-kb plasmid is composed of: (i) the replication origin of pACYC184; (ii) the attachment site (att) of Tn1545; (iii) erythromycin-and kanamycin-resistance-encoding genes for selection in Gram- and Gram+ bacteria; and (iv) the transfer origin of IncP plasmid RK2, which allows mobilization of the vector from Escherichia coli to various Gram+ recipients. Integration of pAT112 requires the presence of the transposon-encoded integrase, Int-Tn, in the new host. This vector retains the insertion specificity of the parental element Tn1545 and utilises it to carry out insertional mutagenesis, as evaluated in Enterococcus faecalis. Since pAT112 contains the pACYC184 replicon and lacks most of the restriction sites that are commonly used for molecular cloning, a gene from a Gram+ bacterium disrupted with this vector can be recovered in E. coli by cleavage of genomic DNA, intramolecular ligation and transformation. Regeneration of the gene, by excision of pAT112, can be obtained in an E. coli strain expressing the excisionase and integrase of Tn1545. The functionality of this system was illustrated by characterization of an IS30-like structure in the chromosome of En. faecalis. Derivatives pAT113 and pAT114 contain ten unique cloning sites that allow screening of recombinants having DNA inserts by alpha-complementation in E. coli carrying the delta M15 deletion of lacZ alpha. These vectors are useful to clone and introduce foreign genes into the genomes of Gram+ bacteria.
TI  - [Antibacterial activities of ofloxacin against recent isolates from patients with community-acquired infections].
AB  - In order to survey antibacterial activities of ofloxacin (OFLX) against 1,440 bacterial strains isolated from patients with community-acquired infections in 1987 and 1990, minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the drug as well as those of other new quinolones and oral cephems were determined. The following conclusions were reached. 1. Comparison of the MIC distribution for strains isolated in 1987 with those in 1990 suggested a tendency toward an increase in the frequency of OFLX-resistant isolates with the passage of time of Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter spp., Klebsiella ssp., Enterobacter spp., Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia spp., and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. Most common elevations of MIC values against these bacteria were observed in MIC80 and MIC90 values, while no significant alteration was observed in MIC50 values. However, MIC50's of OFLX against Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were relatively high for strains isolated in both 1987 and 1990. Most of the OFLX-resistant strains of S. aureus seemed to be methicillin-resistant (MRSA). Furthermore, MIC80 of OFLX against coagulase-negative staphylococci was high in strains isolated in both 1987 and 1990. 2. Susceptibility of Streptococcus spp. was evaluated only in strains isolated in 1990. The results were comparable to those reported by others in the early 1980s. 3. Bacteria which showed no or infrequent emergence of OFLX-resistant strains even in 1990 were Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Campylobacter spp. and Peptostreptococcus spp. 4. Recently isolated strains from patients with community-acquired infections showed a tendency toward an increase of the frequency of OFLX-resistant strains among many bacteria. However, the bacteria which contained high percentages of OFLX-resistant strains except for MRSA were so-called less-virulent bacteria, and in the other bacteria elevations of MIC values were only observed in MIC80 and MIC90. These results suggested that OFLX preserved a potent antibacterial activity against bacteria which were major causative pathogens in community-acquired infections.
TI  - Effect of NaCl-induced osmotic stress on intracellular concentrations of glycine  betaine and potassium in Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, and staphylococci.
AB  - Staphylococci are more salt tolerant than are enterococci or Escherichia coli. They have a more rigid cell wall and higher internal turgor pressure. The mechanisms of NaCl-induced osmotic tolerance among these bacteria were examined by determining the generation of osmoprotective activity of cellular extracts and intracellular concentrations of glycine betaine and potassium (K+) in response to graded amounts of NaCl. Staphylococci as well as E. coli were shown to require choline or glycine betaine to achieve maximal salt tolerance. In response to 0.9 mol/L NaCl, E. coli exhibited a marked increase in osmoprotective activity, a 168-fold rise in glycine betaine, and a 2.3-fold rise in K+. Enterococcus faealis exhibited a small increase in osmoprotective activity, a 9.3-fold increase in glycine betaine, and a twofold increase in K+. In contrast, strains of Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, and S. saprophyticus were found to have considerably greater osmoprotective activity, glycine betaine, and K+ than other organisms, even in the absence of external osmotic stress. Glycine betaine rose in some strains, but K+ remained virtually unchanged as the concentration of NaCl was increased. The high concentrations of glycine betaine and K+ in staphylococci, even in the absence of osmotic stress, may explain in part their remarkable salt tolerance and high turgor pressure.
TI  - Bacteriologically stressed animal model of new closed catheter drainage system with microbicidal outlet tube.
AB  - We have used a catheterized rabbit model to test a newly developed catheter drainage system that incorporates a microbicidal outlet tube. In these tests, this new system was compared with a currently marketed closed drainage system, with daily challenge at the outlet tube using an auxotrophically marked uropathogenic strain of Escherichia coli. In the control series (silicone catheter connected to a standard drainage bag via a tamper-evidence seal) the challenge organism developed upstream biofilm colonization of the luminal surfaces of the catheter and drainage system that was complete in 4.6 +/- 2.1 days in 11 animals, while in 1 animal a rapid overgrowth of the system with Streptococcus faecalis developed. The presence of organisms other than the marked E. coli strain on the luminal surfaces of these control catheters showed that down stream colonization was also operative. In the test catheter drainage series, the microbicidal outlet tube insert precluded upstream colonization by the challenge organism in 12 of 16 catheters and significantly delayed (7.2 +/- 1.0 days) this colonization in the remaining 4 animals. When upstream colonization by exogenous bacteria was precluded by this effective device, downstream colonization of the drainage system by mixed populations of bacteria that probably migrated into the bladder via the extraluminal urethral route developed in some animals (6 of 16).
TI  - [The characteristics of Staphylococcus aureus peptidoglycan in the spectrum of the reactivity of human lymphocytes to bacterial peptidoglycans].
AB  - The sensitivity of lymphocytes of healthy persons to S. aureus peptidoglycan as compared with that to the polyclonal stimulator zymosan C3b and peptidoglycans of other bacteria (Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Bacterium bifidum) was analyzed with a test system permitting the determination of specific reactivity to peptidoglycans. The analysis showed that at the peak of luminol-dependent chemiluminescence (25-30 minutes) individual reactivity to S. aureus peptidoglycan varied within wide limits (the coefficient of lymphocyte stimulation was 1.4-9.6, 3.5 +/- 0.6), exceeding sensitivity to other bacteria, as well as the values obtained in the negative control. The conclusion of the wide spread of sensitization to S. aureus peptidoglycan and the possibility of using this preparation for the study of cell-mediated immunity reactions was made.
TI  - Low cost device for electrotransformation and its application to the highly efficient transformation of Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - A simple, low cost device for electrotransformation has been designed and constructed. The cost of the circuit was only $150. Maximum field strength of 12,000 V/cm with an actual time constant up to 11 msec was obtained with a newly designed circuitry and a 0.1-cm electrode gap cuvette. Eschericia coli strains DH1, DH5 alpha, and LE392 were transformed at an efficiency of 10(9)/micrograms DNA with plasmids pUC18 and pBR322. E. faecalis strain OG1X was transformed at an efficiency of 0.9 x 10(5)/micrograms DNA without treatment with glycine.
TI  - Bacteriological nasal flora in newborns indicating health and/or development of infection.
AB  - During delivery, a fetus otherwise sterile during the intrauterine life, comes in contact with bacterial flora of the mother's birth canal, and then also with the ward personnel's skin and respiratory system flora. Due to the absence of competitive bacteriological flora, the nasal cavity is gradually colonized by microorganisms, especially those with a capacity of adhesion to epithelial cells of respiratory nasal mucosa. Bacteriological flora of the newborn's nasal flora was observed on days 1 and 3 postpartum, in an attempt to determine whether a finding of pathogenic bacterial flora in newborn's nasal mucosa indicates a localized infection only or points to the possible development of generalized infection. Bacteriological nasal flora was monitored in infants born by spontaneous delivery and in those born by cesarean section. In mothers of infants born by spontaneous delivery, bacteriological flora from the cervix uteri was investigated. Results of the study performed by usual methods revealed Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus to prevail in the pathogenic flora. Gram-negative microorganisms were found to be good indicators of local infection of newborn's nasal mucosa, regardless of the absence of clinical symptoms.
TI  - Cloning, sequencing, and expression in Escherichia coli of a Streptococcus faecalis autolysin.
AB  - A Streptococcus faecalis genomic bank was obtained by partial digestion with MboI and cloning into the SalI restriction site of pTZ18R. Screening of about 60,000 Escherichia coli transformants for cell wall lysis activity was done by exposing recombinant colonies grown on medium containing lyophilized Micrococcus lysodeikticus cells to chloroform and toluene vapors in order to release proteins. Because this procedure provoked cell death, colonies could not be used directly for transformant recovery; however, recovery was achieved by partial purification of plasmid DNA from active colonies on the agar plate and transformation of E. coli competent cells. About 60 recombinants were found. One of them (pSH6500) codes for a lytic enzyme active against S. faecalis and M. lysodeikticus cell walls. A shorter clone (pSH4000) was obtained by deleting an EcoRI fragment from the 6.5-kb original insert, leaving a 4-kb EcoRI-MboI insert; this subclone expressed the same lytic activity. Sequencing of a portion of pSH4000 revealed a unique open reading frame of 2,013 nucleotides coding for a 641-amino-acid (74-kDa) polypeptide and containing four 204-nucleotide direct repeats.
TI  - [An electron microscopic study of the interaction of bacterial intestinal microflora and rotavirus virions].
AB  - Transmission electron microscopy has revealed the capacity of rotaviruses for adsorption on Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis cells and the absence of such capacity with respect to Enterococcus faecalis, Lactobacillus casei and Edwardsiella tarda. Different degrees and a varying character of the adsorption of rotaviruses by the representatives of the opportunistic group of bacteria have been established, which may aggravate the course of rotavirus diarrhea due to the aggregation of viral particles. For the first time the phenomenon of the selective destructive adsorption of rotaviruses by E. coli indigenous strains M-17 and 33/29, typical representatives of normal enteric microflora, is described. This observation should be regarded as one of important biological mechanisms responsible for the protection of the body from rotavirus infection.
TI  - Cloning and nucleotide base sequence analysis of a spectinomycin adenyltransferase AAD(9) determinant from Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - Enterococcus faecalis LDR55, a human clinical isolate, is resistant to tetracycline (Tcr), erythromycin (Emr), and high levels (greater than 2,000 micrograms/ml) of spectinomycin (Spr) but not streptomycin. Filter matings between strain LDR55 and E. faecalis OG1-RF produced transconjugants with the following resistance phenotypes: Tcr Emr Spr, Tcr Emr, Tcr Spr, and Tcr only but never Emr or Spr only. The genetic determinant encoding resistance to spectinomycin was cloned in Streptococcus sanguis Challis from pDL55, a 26-kb plasmid harbored by a Tcr Spr transconjugant. Subcloning experiments yielded a 1.1-kb ClaI-NdeI fragment that encoded very high-level Spr in S. sanguis (10 mg/ml) and Escherichia coli (50 mg/ml). Cell extracts of cultures obtained from Spr strains expressed adenylating activity for spectinomycin but not for streptomycin, indicating that Spr was due to an AAD(9) activity. The nucleotide base sequence of the 1.1-kb ClaI-NdeI fragment contained a single 750-base open reading frame. The protein predicted from the open reading frame consisted of 250 amino acids and had a calculated size of approximately 28,000 daltons, similar to the size estimated from maxicell analysis (29,000 daltons). The deduced amino acid sequence of the streptococcal AAD(9) was compared with that of the AAD(9) encoded by staphylococcal transposon Tn554. The two proteins shared approximately 39% amino acid identity, which was expanded to 53% when conservative amino acid changes were included. When the streptococcal protein was compared with an AAD(3")(9) protein of E. coli, the degrees of identity were 27 and 47%, on the basis of actual amino acids and conservative replacements, respectively. The cloning and nucleotide base sequence analyses of the spectinomycin AAD(9) determinant from E. faecalis that results in high-level Spr when transferred to S. sanguis or E. coli are presented.
TI  - Two lipoyl domains in the dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase chain of the pyruvate dehydrogenase multienzyme complex of Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - A fragment of DNA incorporating the gene, pdhC, that encodes the dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase (E2) chain of the pyruvate dehydrogenase multienzyme complex of Streptococcus faecalis was cloned and a DNA sequence of 2360 bp was determined. The pdhC gene (1620 bp) corresponds to an E2 chain of 539 amino acid residues, Mr 56,466, comprising two lipoyl domains, a peripheral subunit-binding domain and an acetyltransferase domain, linked together by regions of polypeptide chain rich in alanine, proline and charged amino acids. The S. faecalis E2 chain differs in the number of its lipoyl domains from the E2 chains of all bacterial pyruvate dehydrogenase complexes hitherto described.
TI  - Unidirectional theta replication of the structurally stable Enterococcus faecalis plasmid pAM beta 1.
AB  - Numerous bacterial replicons remain poorly characterized due to difficulties in localization of the replication origin. We have circumvented this problem in the characterization and fine mapping of the origin of plasmid pAM beta 1 by exploiting the Bacillus subtilis termination signal, terC. In terC-containing derivatives, theta-form molecules with two invariant endpoints accumulate. The endpoints, which correspond to plasmid origin and terC, were mapped with single-nucleotide precision. Analysis of the replication intermediates of wild-type molecules by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis confirmed the location of the plasmid origin. Our results demonstrate that pAM beta 1 replication proceeds unidirectionally by a theta mechanism. This work confirms the use of termination signals to localize origins, suggests that termination in B. subtilis occurs by a mechanism similar to that of Escherichia coli and establishes that in addition to rolling circle replicating plasmids, Gram positive bacteria harbour plasmids which replicate by a theta mechanism.
TI  - Selected faecal bacteria and nutrients essential for antagonism of Salmonella typhimurium in anaerobic continuous flow cultures.
AB  - As few as five of the species of bacteria commonly found in human faeces--Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacteroides ovatus and Fusobacterium varium--when grown together in anaerobic continuous flow cultures exerted antagonistic effects on Salmonella typhimurium as great as those given by mixed bacteria from extracts of human faeces. In a single culture, the population of S. typhimurium was c. 10(8) cfu/ml but in mixed cultures with the five antagonistic bacteria or mixed faecal bacteria it was reduced to c. 10(3) cfu/ml. Antagonism appeared to be the result of competition for the growth limiting amino acids, arginine, serine, threonine and aspartic acid. Optimal manifestation of antagonism required the presence of carbon sources fermentable only by antagonistic bacteria, such as lactose 0.1%, w/v, sucrose 0.1% (w/v) and starch 0.2-0.3% w/v. These carbohydrates promoted the growth of the antagonistic bacteria, particularly E. coli and B. ovatus. However, an increase in concentration by several fold of any one of four growth-limiting amino acids in the medium diminished the antagonistic effects and the population of S. typhimurium rose 10(2)-10(3)-fold.
TI  - Bacteriology of the anal wound after open hemorrhoidectomy. Qualitative and quantitative analysis.
AB  - The purpose of this study is to analyze the size of the bacterial colonies in anal wounds after open hemorrhoidectomy. Twenty patients were studied during predetermined postoperative time periods. Material was collected from the surface and from within the tissue of each patient's three open wounds, intraoperatively, on the 6th, 13th and 20th postoperative days for bacteriologic examination in aerobic, microaerophilic, and anaerobic media. The bacterium most commonly identified was Escherichia coli, followed by Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, and Proteus mirabilis were also identified. Critical indexes of colonization were present since the intraoperative stage (greater than 10(5) bacteria/g of tissue and greater than 10(6) bacteria/ml); obligate anaerobic bacteria were not identified; neither the species nor the number of bacteria, even when critical indexes were present, prevented proper healing. The same bacteria were not necessarily present on the surface and in the tissue; the bacterial load observed among the three wounds (left lateral, right posterior, and right anterior), was the same.
TI  - In vitro activity of the novel cephalosporin GR69153.
AB  - The in vitro activity of GR69153 was compared to that of ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, imipenem and gentamicin against a total of 702 recent clinical isolates. MICs were determined by a standard agar dilution procedure and two inocula (10(4) and 10(8) cfu) were used throughout. GR69153 inhibited 90% of isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia and Proteus mirabilis at less than or equal to 0.25 mg/l and 90% of isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa at less than or equal to 1 mg/l. Citrobacter freundii (MIC90 16 mg/l), Morganella morganii (MIC90 128 mg/l) and Enterobacter spp. (MIC90 greater than 128 mg/l) were considerably more resistant to GR69153. GR69153 was four-fold more active than ceftazidime against methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus but was inactive against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis and Bacteroides fragilis group.
TI  - Conjugative transposition of Tn916 requires the excisive and integrative activities of the transposon-encoded integrase.
AB  - Transposon Tn916 is a 16.4-kb broad-host-range conjugative transposon originally  detected in the chromosome of Enterococcus faecalis DS16. Transposition of Tn916 and related transposons involves excision of a free, nonreplicative, covalently closed circular intermediate that is substrate for integration. Excisive recombination requires two transposon-encoded proteins, Xis-Tn and Int-Tn, whereas the latter protein alone is sufficient for integration. Here we report that conjugative transposition of Tn916 requires the presence of a functional integrase in both donor and recipient strains. We have constructed a mutant, designated Tn916-int1, by replacing the gene directing synthesis of Int-Tn by an allele inactivated in vitro. In mating experiments, transfer of Tn916-int1 from Bacillus subtilis to E. faecalis was detected only when the transposon-encoded integrase was supplied by trans-complementation in both the donor and the recipient. These results suggest that conjugative transposition of Tn916 requires circularization of the element in the donor followed by transfer and integration of the nonreplicative intermediate in the recipient.
TI  - Shuttle vectors containing a multiple cloning site and a lacZ alpha gene for conjugal transfer of DNA from Escherichia coli to gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The mobilizable shuttle cloning vectors, pAT18 and pAT19, are composed of: (i) the replication origins of pUC and of the broad-host-range enterococcal plasmid pAM beta 1; (ii) an erythromycin-resistance-encoding gene expressed in Gram- and Gram+ bacteria; (iii) the transfer origin of the IncP plasmid RK2; and (iv) the multiple cloning site and the lacZ alpha reporter gene of pUC18 (pAT18) and pUC19 (pAT19). These 6.6-kb plasmids contain ten unique cloning sites that allow screening of derivatives containing DNA inserts by alpha-complementation in Escherichia coli carrying the lacZ delta M15 deletion, and can be efficiently mobilized by self-transferable IncP plasmids co-resident in the E. coli donors. Plasmids pAT18, pAT19 and recombinant derivatives have been successfully transferred by conjugation from E. coli to Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus thuringiensis, Listeria monocytogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Lactococcus lactis, and Staphylococcus aureus at frequencies ranging from 10(-6) to 10(-9). The presence of a restriction system in the recipient dramatically affects (by three orders of magnitude) the efficiency of conjugal transfer of these vectors from E. coli to Gram+ bacteria.
TI  - Enumeration by a miniaturized method of Escherichia coli, Streptococcus bovis and enterococci as indicators of the origin of faecal pollution of waters.
AB  - Counts of Escherichia coli, faecal streptococci and enterococci were made on faecal specimens from human and animal origin and urban raw sewage waters, with microtiter plates containing selective substances. Escherichia coli was more numerous than faecal streptococci and enterococci in 80% of the samples regardless of the origin. Consequently the use of the ratio E. coli/faecal streptococci to distinguish human from animal origin of faecal pollution is questionable. Enterococcus faecalis was predominant in human and poultry faeces, Streptococcus bovis was typical of the bovine faeces and to a lesser extent also of pig faeces whereas Enterococcus durans, Ent. hirae and Ent. faecium did not characterize any faecal source. Streptococcus bovis could be distinguished in the microtiter plate by its inability to reduce triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) in the medium.
TI  - Mannitol-specific phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system of Enterococcus faecalis: molecular cloning and nucleotide sequences of the enzyme IIIMtl gene and the mannitol-1-phosphate dehydrogenase gene, expression in Escherichia coli, and comparison of the gene products with similar enzymes.
AB  - Enzyme IIIMtl is part of the mannitol phosphotransferase system of Enterococcus faecalis. It is phosphorylated in a reaction sequence requiring enzyme I and heat-stable phosphocarrier protein (HPr). The phospho group is transferred from enzyme IIIMtl to enzyme IIMtl, which then catalyzes the uptake and concomitant phosphorylation of mannitol. The internalized mannitol-1-phosphate is oxidized to fructose-6-phosphate by mannitol-1-phosphate dehydrogenase. In this report we describe the cloning of the mtlF and mtlD genes, encoding enzyme IIIMtl and mannitol-1-phosphate dehydrogenase of E. faecalis, by a complementation system designed for cloning of gram-positive phosphotransferase system genes. The complete nucleotide sequences of mtlF, mtlD, and flanking regions were determined. From the gene sequences, the primary translation products are deduced to consist of 145 amino acids (enzyme IIIMtl) and 374 amino acids (mannitol-1-phosphate dehydrogenase). Amino acid sequence comparison confirmed a 41% similarity of E. faecalis enzyme IIIMtl to the hydrophilic enzyme IIIMtl-like portion of enzyme IIMtl of Escherichia coli and 45% similarity to enzyme IIIMtl of Staphylococcus carnosus. The putative N-terminal NAD+ binding domain of mannitol-1-phosphate dehydrogenase of E. faecalis shows a high degree of similarity with the N terminus of E. coli mannitol-1-phosphate dehydrogenase (T. Davis, M. Yamada, M. Elgort, and M. H. Saier, Jr., Mol. Microbiol. 2:405-412, 1988) and the N-terminal part of the translation product of S. carnosus mtlD, which was also determined in this study. There is 40% similarity between the dehydrogenases of E. faecalis and E. coli over the whole length of the enzymes. The organization of mannitol-specific genes in E. faecalis seems to be similar to the organization in S. carnosus. The open reading frame for enzyme IIIMtl E. faecalis is followed by a stem-loop structure, analogous to a typical Rho-independent terminator. We conclude that the mannitol-specific genes are organized in an operon and that the gene order is mtlA orfX mtlF mtlD.
TI  - Characterization of the gentamicin resistance transposon Tn5281 from Enterococcus faecalis and comparison to staphylococcal transposons Tn4001 and Tn4031.
AB  - In Enterococcus faecalis, the genetic determinant encoding gentamicin resistance  (Gmr) on the conjugative plasmid pBEM10 previously has been shown to be on a mobile element. In the current study, this element, termed Tn5281, was shown to relocate in the absence of homologous recombination in E. faecalis UV202. On the basis of restriction endonuclease analysis and DNA-DNA hybridization studies, Tn5281 was shown to be similar, if not identical, to the Gmr transposons Tn4001 found in Australian isolates of Staphylococcus aureus and Tn4031 found in U.S. isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis, since all three of these transposons have symmetrically located HindIII (2.5 kb apart), ClaI (slightly more than 2.5 kb apart), and HaeIII (3.9 kb apart) sites. Restriction endonuclease digestion patterns of Tn5281 generated with HincII, ScaI, and AluI were also consistent with Tn4001 and Tn4031. By using a probe specific for the external portion of the terminal inverted repeat of Tn4031, it was determined that each terminus of Tn5281 contained a 0.35-kb HaeIII fragment and a 0.7-kb HindIII-HaeIII fragment. The sizes of these fragments are identical to those found in the staphylococcal transposons, which is a further indication that inverted repeats like IS256 are present in Tn5281. A 1-kb HaeIII fragment in pBEM10 also hybridized with this probe, which indicates that Tn5281 in pBEM10 contains a double copy of the inverted repeat at one end.
TI  - Aztreonam versus gentamicin for short-term prophylaxis in biliary and gastric surgery.
AB  - Short-term antibiotic prophylaxis was studied in 80 patients undergoing biliary or gastric surgery. The patients were randomized to receive 1 g of aztreonam or 80 mg of gentamicin intravenously 30 minutes before surgery and 8 and 16 hours after surgery. Of samples taken from the abdominal cavity for bacteriologic study, 53% were culture positive. Wound infections developed in two (4.5%) of 44 patients receiving aztreonam and in seven (19.4%) of 36 patients treated with gentamicin. Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterobacter species were isolated from sites of wound infection in the aztreonam group; Escherichia coli (two isolates), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (two isolates), Enterobacter species, Klebsiella species, Enterococcus faecalis, and Aeromonas hydrophila were isolated from the gentamicin group. Our data indicate that aztreonam is safe and effective for the prevention of infections following biliary and gastric surgery.
TI  - Susceptibility of female pelvic pathogens to oral antibiotic agents in patients who develop postpartum endometritis.
AB  - Fifteen hundred patients were enrolled in a prospective, randomized study on the  effect of antibiotic prophylaxis during cesarean section. Two hundred thirty-one patients developed postpartum endometritis, and the isolates obtained from the endometrium were tested for sensitivity to ampicillin, cefuroxime, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and clindamycin. Minimum inhibitory concentrations of 50% and 90% of ampicillin, cefuroxime, and clindamycin were similar to previously reported values; however, slight differences were noted in the activity of the two quinolones to common pelvic isolates. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of 90% of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin to 119 isolates of Enterococcus faecalis were 4.0 and 2.0, to 17 isolates of Staphylococcus aureus 1.0 and 0.5, to 39 isolates of Escherichia coli 0.5 and 1.0, to 46 isolates of Bacteroides bivius 4.0 and 8.0, to 57 isolates of Gardnerella vaginalis 1.0 and 2.0, to 71 isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis 0.5 and 0.5, to 16 isolates of Proteus mirabilis 0.25 and 0.12, and to 50 isolates of Lactobacillus species 32.0 and 8.0 micrograms/ml, respectively. In summary, the quinolones have activity comparable with a variety of other oral agents versus female pelvic pathogens, with the quinolones ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin having better activity against most of the gram-negative isolates. Anaerobic activities were comparable with the beta-lactams, but inferior to clindamycin and metronidazole as expected.
TI  - Comparative analysis of Enterococcus faecalis sex pheromone plasmids identifies a single homologous DNA region which codes for aggregation substance.
AB  - An analysis of the 11 known sex pheromone plasmids of Enterococcus faecalis was performed by DNA-DNA hybridization. Plasmids pAD1, pJH2, and pBEM10 turned out to be closely related, whereas pAM373 showed only weak homology with pAD1. A comparison of the hemolysin/bacteriocin determinants of pAD1, pJH2, and pOB1 revealed strong similarities at the DNA level. Our main finding was that one DNA region is conserved among all sex pheromone plasmids, with pAM373 again being an exception; for pAD1 this region was shown earlier to code for aggreagation substance. Detailed hybridization studies of the genes for this plasmid-coded adhesin, which is responsible for cell-cell contact during conjugative transfer via the so-called sex pheromone system of E. faecalis, support the idea of their common origin.
TI  - [The infectivity of Enterococcus faecalis in experimental urinary tract infection in mice: II].
AB  - The infectivity of Enterococcus faecalis was compared with that of Escherichia coli in the urinary tract in mice. The infectivity of E. faecalis in normal mice was found to be equal to that of E. coli. The mice previously treated with cyclophosphamide, carrageenin or alloxan as the immunosuppressive drug, and restricted water supply, were more susceptible to enterococcal infection than non-treated ones. These data were confirmed with histological examinations. E. faecalis is a pathogenic organism in the urinary tract and therefore cautions should be given to the treatment in clinical practice.
TI  - Improved electroporation and cloning vector system for gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - A protocol for transformation of intact Enterococcus faecalis cells by electroporation was developed through a systematic examination of the effects of changes in various parameters, including (i) growth conditions; (ii) composition of the electroporation solution; (iii) electroporation conditions, such as field strength and resistance; (iv) size, concentration, and purity of DNA used for transformation; and (v) conditions used to select for transformants. Key features of this protocol include the use of exponential-phase cells grown in inhibitory concentrations of glycine and the use of an acidic sucrose electroporation solution. Frequencies of greater than 2 x 10(5) transformants per microgram of plasmid DNA were obtained for E. faecalis cells, whereas various strains of streptococci and Bacillus anthracis were transformed at frequencies of 10(3) to 10(4) transformants per microgram of plasmid DNA with the same protocol. A novel Escherichia coli-Streptococcus and Enterococcus shuttle cloning vector, pDL276, was constructed for use in conjunction with the electroporation system. This vector features a multiple cloning site region flanked by E. coli transcription termination sequences, a relatively small size (less than 7 kb), and a kanamycin resistance determinant expressed in both gram-positive and gram-negative hosts. Various enterococcal and streptococcal DNA sequences were cloned in E. coli (including sequences that could not be cloned on other vectors) and were returned to the original host by electroporation. The vector and electroporation system was also used to clone directly into E. faecalis.
TI  - Molecular characterization of the Enterococcus faecalis cytolysin activator.
AB  - The gene encoding component A (cylA), the activator protein of the Enterococcus faecalis cytolysin, has been localized on pAD1, and the nucleotide sequence was determined. cylA consists of a 1,236-bp open reading frame encoding a 412-amino-acid polypeptide. A search of the National Biomedical Research Foundation data base revealed significant homology between the inferred amino acid sequence of component A and subtilisin BPN'. Component A activation of the cytolysin precursor (component L) was observed to be inhibited by the serine protease inhibitor diisopropylfluorophosphate. Mature component A exhibits a molecular weight of approximately 30,000 and an isoelectric point of 4.5. Differences between the size of the primary translation product (45,625 daltons) and the mature enzyme suggest that, as for subtilisin, component A is secreted as a proenzyme. These results provide the basis for a model of component A activation of component L and a role for component A in protecting the cytolysin-producing cell from lysis.
TI  - [Influence of cefodizime on intestinal bacterial flora].
AB  - Effects of cefodizime (CDZM), a new injectable cephem antibiotic, on the intestinal bacterial flora were studied in tetra-contaminated mice and in pediatric patients. CDZM was intramuscularly administered at a dose of 100 mg/kg once a day for 5 consecutive days to mice contaminated with 4 different species of organisms: Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacteroides fragilis and Bifidobacterium breve. For 3 species except E. faecalis, bacterial populations in feces were markedly reduced after the start of the treatment. Subjects in the pediatric study were 5 children with bacterial infections (4 boys and 1 girl) at ages from 7 months to 9 years 6 months and with their body weights ranging from 7.6 kg to 51.1 kg. CDZM was intravenously administered at a dose of 9.7 mg/kg to 23.0 mg/kg 4 times a day for 5 to 15 days. Although some variations in the fecal bacterial flora were noticed among these subjects during the treatment, populations of main aerobes and anaerobes such as Enterobacteriaceae, Enterococcus, Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium and Eubacterium decreased markedly in most cases. Glucose non-fermenting Gram-negative rods and fungi tended to increase during or after the administration of CDZM, and they were the most predominant species in some cases. Although these changes tended to return to predosing states after the cessation of the treatment with CDZM, attention must be paid to possible occurrences of diarrhea, superinfection or bleeding tendency when treatment with the drug is continued for long periods of time. Fecal concentrations of CDZM considered to be closely related to the changes of the intestinal bacterial flora showed pretty high values in all cases.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of E-4497, a new 3-amine-3-methyl-azetidinyl tricyclic fluoroquinolone.
AB  - The in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of a new tricyclic fluoroquinolone, E-4497 [S(-)-9-fluoro-3-methyl-10-(3-amine-3-methyl-azetidin-1-yl)-7-oxo- 2,3-dihydro- 7H-pyrido-(1,2,3-de)-1,4-benzoxazine-6-carboxylic acid], were evaluated in comparison with those of DR-3355 [S-(-)-ofloxacin], norfloxacin, and ciprofloxacin. E-4497 was more potent than norfloxacin and as potent as or more potent than DR-3355 and ciprofloxacin against Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus spp., and Enterococcus faecalis. With the exception of Providencia spp., E-4497 inhibited 90% of the Enterobacteriaceae at less than or equal to 0.25 micrograms/ml. Against enteric bacteria, E-4497 was similar in potency to norfloxacin but less potent than DR-3355 and ciprofloxacin. For Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the MICs of E-4497, DR-3355, norfloxacin, and ciprofloxacin for 90% of strains were 2, 2, 4, and 0.5 micrograms/ml, respectively. Against Clostridium perfringens and Bacteroides fragilis, E-4497 (MICs for 90% of strains, 2 and 8 micrograms/ml, respectively) was two- to fourfold more active than norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin. E-4497 activity decreased moderately in the presence of 10 mM Mg2+. Urine at pH 5.5 caused a significant decrease in activity compared with urine at pH 7.2. However, the presence of serum either had no effect or increased the activity of E-4497. In general, E-4497 was bactericidal at the MIC. In systemic infections with Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in mice, the protective effect of E-4497 was generally greater than that of norfloxacin and comparable to those of DR-3355 and ciprofloxacin.
TI  - Role of Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis in intraabdominal abscess formation in the rat.
AB  - Our concept of the pathogenesis of acute salpingitis and advanced pelvic infection, such as tuboovarian abscess, is evolving. Although Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis are thought to play a significant role in acute pelvic inflammatory disease, other microorganisms, such as aerobes and anaerobes, have repeatedly been reported to play a significant role, also, particularly in the patient with advanced disease. A study was designed to evaluate the pathogenesis, and particularly any synergistic role, of some aerobes and anaerobes with N gonorrhoeae and C trachomatis abscess formation. Using the rat model developed by Weinstein and Onderdonk, the study demonstrated that N gonorrhoeae and C trachomatis alone do not produce abscesses. However, when combined with facultative or anaerobic bacteria, synergism with abscess formation is noted frequently. The data support the hypothesis that N gonorrhoeae and C trachomatis initiate infection and that aerobic and anaerobic bacteria act synergistically to produce abscesses. In addition, microorganisms not inoculated were found to be recruited into the infectious process. The organisms may gain access to the peritoneal cavity via the lower genital tract or from transmucosal migration from the intestinal flora.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of ciprofloxacin against fresh clinical isolates from superficial suppurative foci].
AB  - The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 5 drugs (ciprofloxacin (CPFX), and 4 drugs used as standard) were determined to investigate antibacterial potencies of CPFX against bacterial strains isolated in 1989 from superficial suppurative foci. The clinical isolates tested included 375 strains from 11 aerobic bacterial species, and 50 strains from 2 anerobic bacterial genera (group) for a total of 425 isolates. Interpreting MIC level distributions of these drugs as the expression of antibacterial potencies, the results are as follows. 1. When activities of new-quinolone antibiotics were tested, we found that, CPFX expressed far superior antibacterial potency to ofloxacin (OFLX) and norfloxacin (NFLX) against coagulase-negative staphylococci, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Peptostreptococcus spp., although the activity of CPFX against Bacteroides fragilis group was weaker than that of OFLX, and CPFX had similar activity against Staphylococcus aureus to OFLX. 2. In comparison to beta-lactam antibiotics, CPFX was inferior to amoxicillin (AMPC) against E. faecalis and inferior to AMPC and cefaclor (CCL) against Peptostreptococcus spp. Against all other bacterial species, however, CPFX expressed superior antibacterial potency to AMPC and CCL. 3. Scattered findings of low sensitivity or resistance to CPFX were observed among the S. aureus, E. faecalis, E. faecium, P. vulgaris, M. morganii, P. aeruginosa and B. fragilis (group) species, but with an exception of E. faecium, the incidence of resistance strains was low.
TI  - Effect of hydrogen peroxide on growth of Candida, Cryptococcus, and other yeasts  in simulated blood culture bottles.
AB  - The addition of hydrogen peroxide to blood contained in liquid culture medium increased the dissolved-O2 partial pressure in direct proportion to the volume injected. The effect of hydrogen peroxide on the growth of subcultured clinical isolates of Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans, Torulopsis glabrata, and other yeasts and on the growth of blood culture isolates of representative pathogenic bacteria was compared with its effect on their growth in vented and unvented stationary bottles. C. albicans and C. neoformans grew significantly better in bottles to which hydrogen peroxide had been added than in vented or unvented bottles. The advantage of hydrogen peroxide over venting was most marked with several slowly growing strains. Similar results were obtained in shaker cultures with strains of C. albicans which were inoculated directly from positive blood cultures. The effect of hydrogen peroxide tended to diminish during serial passage. T. glabrata grew less well when hydrogen peroxide was added, perhaps because of the absence of oxidase. The growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterococcus faecalis was not significantly inhibited or augmented by the addition of hydrogen peroxide. The growth of Escherichia coli was inhibited slightly. The value of the addition of hydrogen peroxide to blood cultures to improve the isolation of yeasts needs to be established by a clinical trial which would compare this method with established methods.
TI  - Relative contributions of host and microbial factors in bacterial translocation.
AB  - To study the relative contributions of host and microbial factors in bacterial translocation, germfree mice were mono-associated with either Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, or Enterococcus faecalis. Germfree mice included T-cell-deficient nude mice and normal littermates, natural killer cell-deficient beige mice and normal littermates, and triply immunodeficient mice with beige, T-cell, and B-cell mutations and their littermates. Each bacterial species colonized the cecum in similarly high numbers. Bacteria were recovered from the mesenteric lymph node of every mouse in inconsistent numbers, eg, greater numbers of P mirabilis and E coli were recovered from T-cell-deficient nude mice than from their normal littermates, but the opposite was observed with E faecalis. Comparing the three bacterial species resulted in relatively consistent observations, eg, the incidence of E faecalis translocation to the liver was greater than that of E coli or P mirabilis translocation. Thus, the identity of the translocating microbe significantly affected the recovery of viable translocating bacteria.
TI  - In vitro studies with Bay V 3522, a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  - The in vitro activities of Bay v 3522, cefaclor, cephalexin, cefuroxime, cefixime, amoxicillin/clavulanate (2:1) and reference penicillins were compared against 314 clinical isolates of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and nine strains of Escherichia coli that differed in their outer membrane proteins in agar dilution tests with an inoculum of 10(4) cfu/spot. The beta-lactamase stabilities of the cephalosporins were also evaluated by spectrophotometric assay using 21 different beta-lactamases. Bay v 3522 was the most potent cephalosporin overall against Gram-positive pathogens, but slightly less active than amoxicillin/clavulanate. In addition to being highly active against streptococci (MIC90 = 0.25 micrograms/ml) and methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (MIC90 = 1.0 micrograms/ml), Bay v 3522 was markedly more active than the other cephalosporins against Enterococcus faecalis (MIC90 = 4 micrograms/ml). Bay v 3522 was less potent against Gram-negative pathogens, especially nosocomial isolates of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae (MIC90 greater than 64 micrograms/ml), but was active against Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, and beta-lactamase-negative Neisseria gonorrhoeae (MIC90 = 1.0 micrograms/ml0. Hydrolysis of Bay v 3522 by most beta-lactamases examined was significantly less than that observed for cephalothin and cefaclor; similar to that observed with cephalexin; and less than that observed with cefixime and cefuroxime. None of the beta-lactamases examined hydrolysed Bay v 3522 at a rate greater than 20 nmol/min/mg. The in vitro potency of Bay v 3522 against Gram-positive and fastidious Gram-negative pathogens and its resistance to hydrolysis by beta-lactamases produced by them support further investigation of this cephalosporin as a new oral therapeutic agent.
TI  - Experimental bacterial prostatitis in rats.
AB  - Experimental acute bacterial prostatitis in rats was induced by four different routes of bacterial inoculation. The most simple and reproducible method of producing bacterial prostatitis was to instil the bacterial suspension into the prostatic urethra after the administration of an appropriate antibiotic to prevent associated pyelonephritis.
TI  - [Complex sanitary-microbiological criteria of evaluating the quality of water in  increasing anthropogenic load].
AB  - It has been established with the help of sanitary-hygienic, microbiological and statistical methods, that the increasing ++anthropogenic stress on water reservoirs induce quantitative and qualitative changes of water biocenosis under the conditions of intensive use of water reservoirs for economic purposes. It can produce unfavourable health effects on the population, as well as on the equilibrium of the local ecological microsystems. The necessity has been substantiated of the use of complex sanitary-microbiological criteria of the assessment of the quality of water objects to provide their epidemic safety, to preserve and rehabilitate the processes of ++self-purification of water under the conditions of technogenic exposures.
TI  - Inactivation of metronidazole by Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - The in-vitro inactivation of metronidazole by different clinical isolates of Enterococcus faecalis was investigated by means of association experiments in which Ent. faecalis strains and Bacteroides fragilis group strains were cultured in the same liquid medium. All of the tested Ent. faecalis strains (20 isolates) were able to protect the B. fragilis group strains against the killing effect of metronidazole at a concentration four or eight times higher than the normal MIC. Different strains of Streptococcus (14), Staphylococcus aureus (10), Staph, epidermidis (10) and Escherichia coli (8) failed to exhibit the same effect. When Ent. faecalis strains were cultured anaerobically for 24 h in the presence of 4 mg metronidazole/l, either alone or together with different B. fragilis group strains, no metronidazole could be detected subsequently in the culture supernatants by HPLC. Concomitantly an increase of four or five logs in the viable counts of the co-cultured Bacteroides strains was observed compared with Bacteroides strains cultured alone. Sonicated cell extracts of Ent. faecalis cultured either aerobically or anaerobically were found to inactivate metronidazole to the same extent, whereas the culture supernatants had no such effect.
TI  - [Comparative studies of the filtration behavior of bacteria and organic particles in porous groundwater conductors. Fundamentals and methods].
AB  - In subsurface aquatic environments two groups of micro-organisms are observed: allochthonous bacteria and viruses, which as contaminants are eliminated from water after some time, and autochthonous groundwater micro-organisms, which belong to the natural subsurface environment and may reach very high abundances under favourable conditions--especially in the presence of a high nutrient supply. The migration of micro-organisms is controlled by flow length dependent transport processes (advection--dispersion, adsorption--desorption), and predominantly by filtration. This can be described on the basis of an expanded advection--dispersion concept. The filter effects in a certain porous aquifer can be quantified by the filter efficiency (filter factor) as a measure of the specific decrease of an initial concentration on a certain flow length. Recent laboratory experiments show that for sand the filter factor depends on the respective microbial species and is highly correlated to the effective grain diameter of the porous material, which is routinely determined in hydrogeology. Experiments with columns filled with quartz sand using the bacteria species Escherichia coli ATCC 11229, Pseudomonas cepacia DSM 50181, Streptococcus faecalis ATCC 6569, and polystyrene beads with similar density and diameters show that the filter factor is controlled by the grain size of filter material, the flow velocity, the diameter of the particle and the ionic strength of the water: The filter factor is specific for each microbial species for the same conditions of the aquatic environment. The filter factor decreases one order of magnitude if the flow velocity increases in the same order. A major control of the filter factor is the grain size. Conventionally the grain size is used as characteristic length instead of the pore size which, although it should be the real reference date, is relatively difficult to measure. For the assessment of the filter factor, the grain size d10, taken from the grain size distribution curve, can be used. The influence of the particle diameter on the filter factor, which was predicted by the filtration theory, was confirmed. The minimum values of the filter factor were encountered at particle diameters of about 1 micron, which is about the size of bacteria. The filter factor is influenced strongly by the ionic strength in water with low ionic strength, whereas in water of higher ionic strength its influence can be neglected. These relationships can be formulated into empirical equations, which allow prediction of the filter factor for given hydraulic conditions.
TI  - Fleroxacin combined with rifampin.
AB  - We determined the effect of the combination of rifampin and fleroxacin against Enterobacteriaceae and streptococcal species. None of the 65 isolates tested by checkerboard assay demonstrated synergy, 12% of isolates showed an additive effect; 86.7% were indifferent, and only 1 isolate showed antagonism. The mean FIC was 1.2. When using 2 and 8 micrograms/ml of rifampin, fleroxacin MICs of 285 isolates of Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, staphylococci, streptococci, Bacteroides, and Clostridium were not increased, but synergy was not demonstrated. Time-kill studies against Escherichia coli, P. aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis failed to show increased killing when the two agents were present at one-half the MBC. The fleroxacin-rifampin interaction is one of indifference but provides coverage for species not adequately inhibited by fleroxacin.
TI  - Diagnostic and genetic studies in 43 patients with classic cystinuria.
AB  - We present results for laboratory screening and diagnostic tests--cyanide-nitroprusside test, semi-quantitative thin-layer chromatography, and quantitative amino acid column chromatography--of 43 patients with classic cystinuria. We report the efficaciousness of the cyanide-nitroprusside test and of thin-layer chromatography, as compared with quantitative amino acid chromatography, for detecting heterozygotes for type II or III cystinuria. The quantitative results for aminoaciduria in 57 blood relatives in 23 families were used to categorize the index patients with classic cystinuria. By column chromatography the ranges of excretion rates (mumol/24 h per 1.73 m2 body surface area) of diagnostic amino acids in the index patients were as follows: cystine 556-54044 (normal 20-128), arginine 131-11543 (10-80), lysine 768-21848 (51-514), ornithine 185-5685 (0-80). Also by column chromatography the median values for arginine and ornithine excretion in cystine-lysinuric heterozygotes (among the 57 blood relatives) were significantly higher (P less than 0.01) than in controls but never approached the values for homozygotes. The cyanide-nitroprusside test results were positive in urine samples of 41 of 43 index patients and in 16 (51.6%) of the urine samples of 31 obligate heterozygotes with column chromatographically proven cystine-lysinuria. Thin-layer chromatography detected all of the homozygotes, all the compound heterozygotes, and 54.8% of the carriers. According to the type of aminoaciduria in their relatives, 11 patients with classic cystinuria could be classified as having classic cystinuria type I, 11 as having type II or III, and three as being compound heterozygotes. We discuss the implications of these results for correct diagnoses and for genetic studies in classic cystinuria.
TI  - Natural transfer of conjugative transposon Tn916 between gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - The conjugative streptococcal transposon Tn916 was found to transfer naturally between a variety of gram-positive and gram-negative eubacteria. Enterococcus faecalis hosting the transposon could serve as a donor for Alcaligenes eutrophus, Citrobacter freundii, and Escherichia coli at frequencies of 10(-6) to 10(-8). No transfer was observed with several phototrophic species. Mating of an E. coli strain carrying Tn916 yielded transconjugants with Bacillus subtilis, Clostridium acetobutylicum, Enterococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus lactis subsp. diacetylactis at frequencies of 10(-4) to 10(-6). Acetobacterium woodii was the only gram-positive organism tested that did not accept the transposon from a gram-negative donor. The results prove the ability of conjugative transposable elements such as Tn916 for natural cross-species gene transfer, thus potentially contributing to bacterial evolution.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence of the gelatinase gene (gelE) from Enterococcus faecalis subsp. liquefaciens.
AB  - The gene coding for gelatinase (also called metalloendopeptidase II; microbial proteinase, EC 3.4.24.4) of Enterococcus faecalis subsp. liquefaciens strain OG1-10 was cloned in an Escherichia coli-Enterococcus shuttle vector, and its nucleotide sequence was determined. The DNA sequence encodes one large open reading frame (ORF) with 509 amino acid residues. The ORF contains a signal sequence in its N-terminal region, whereas the N-terminal amino acid sequence determined from the purified extracellular proteinase starts at residue 192 deduced from the ORF. This implies that the gelatinase is synthesized as a prepropolypeptide or prezymogen. The mature gelatinase contains 318 amino acid residues (molecular weight, 34,582) and has significant homology with neutral proteinases from Bacillus species and elastase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - [Evaluation of the effectiveness of ofloxacin in the treatment of respiratory tract].
AB  - Ofloxacine (Tarivid-Hoechst) was used in 30 patients with infections of the respiratory system, including 12 with pneumonias, 18 with chronic bronchitis. The agent was given in oral form, in a 200 mg tablet every 12 hours for 7 to 10 days. Therapeutical and tolerance was analyzed being on clinical radiological, biochemical and bacteriological findings. Complete remission was found in 21 patients, in 7 more a significant clinical and radiological improvement was found. Altogether in 93.3% of the treated patients the therapeutical efficacy of the agent was found to be excellent. During treatment side effects were not observed. The results if this study demonstrate a high therapeutical efficacy and safety of the agent.
TI  - [Kinetics of bacterial wash-out in the Haemonetics Cell Saver III].
AB  - Autologous, outdated blood units were inoculated with four types of bacteria--Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus--in two concentrations (10e4, 10e6) to test the effect of the washing procedure (Cell Saver III Haemonetics) on the elimination of bacteria. The elimination rate ranged from 17% (Streptococcus faec. 10e4) to 96% (Pseudomonas aer. 10e6). These results confirm the routine use of wash centrifuge systems (type Cell Saver) to process shed wound blood as well as drainage blood for autologous transfusions.
TI  - [Relation between the processes of water self-purification and the level of microbial pollution in the southern regions of the RSFSR].
AB  - It has been found out as result of complex sanitary-hygienic, microbiological and statistical studies, that the intensity of processes of self-purification of the water in water objects form potentially pathogenic microflora is reduced under the im fluence of the increasing anthropogenic stress on the water bodies in the Southern area which can produce unfavourable human health effects. The necessity that a complex of sanitary-microbiological indicators of water quality should be used to provide its epidemic safety has been revealed, and also a criterion of the assessment of the process of self-purification of the water in water bodies according to the acute intestinal infections morbidity of the population.
TI  - An HlyB-type function is required for expression of the Enterococcus faecalis hemolysin/bacteriocin.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of a 3,422-bp internal restriction fragment from the Enterococcus faecalis pAD1 hemolysin/bacteriocin-encoding region was determined. This fragment was associated with expression of hemolysin/bacteriocin component L and contained a 2,142-bp open reading frame. The inferred amino acid sequence revealed a protein which shared extensive similarity with HlyB of the Escherichia coli alpha-hemolysin operon. The inferred protein, CylB, was observed to be independently expressed in E. coli and capable of complementing an insertion mutation in the cloned hemolysin/bacteriocin operon in trans. Despite the extensive similarity to HlyB, CylB was incapable of complementing an insertion mutation in hlyB. Cytolysin determinants possessing an HlyB-type transport function are widely dispersed throughout gram-negative genera. We believe this to be the first example of an HlyB-type protein encoded within a cytolysin determinant from a gram-positive bacterium.
TI  - Comparative in vitro and in vivo activities of six new monofluoroquinolone and difluoroquinolone 3-carboxylic acids with a 7-azetidin ring substituent.
AB  - E-4502, E-4501, E-4500, E-4480, E-4474, and E-4441 are new monofluorinated or difluorinated quinolone agents that are chemically characterized by the presence of an azetidin ring, with different C'-3 substituents, at position 7 of the molecular structure. The MICs of the difluorinated compounds E-4501, E-4474, and E-4441 for 90% of isolates were 0.06 to 1, 0.06 to 1, and 0.12 to 1 microgram/ml, respectively, against gram-positive organisms (staphylococci, streptococci, and Enterococcus faecalis); 0.0015 to 0.12, 0.015 to 0.12, and 0.03 to 0.12 microgram/ml, respectively, against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae except Providencia spp.; and 1, 1, and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively, against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. E-4501, E-4474, and E-4441 inhibited all anaerobic bacteria at concentrations of 1, 2, and 4 micrograms/ml, respectively. Difluorinated compounds were significantly more active than the corresponding monofluorinated analogs E-4502, E-4500, and E-4480 against aerobic and facultatively anaerobic organisms, as well as against anaerobes. Considering monofluorinated and difluorinated compounds, activity in moderate ascending order was observed in quinolones containing an amine and a methyl group (E-4441 and E-4480), an amine group (E-4474 and E-4500), and a methylamine group (E-4501 and E-4502) in the C'-3 position of the azetidin ring. E-4501, E-4474, and E-4441 were more active than norfloxacin and DR-3355 [S-(-)-ofloxacin], had activities comparable to or slightly lower than that of ciprofloxacin against gram-negative bacteria, and were more active than all the reference quinolones against gram-positive organisms and anaerobes. E-4502 and E-4501, which were used to determine the effect of pH, were less active in acidic medium. In general, E-4502, E-4501, E-4500, E-4480, E-4474, and E-4441 activities were not affected or increased in medium containing serum but decreased in the presence of 10 mM Mg2+ or in human urine at pH 5.5. The protective effect of E-4501, E-4474, and E-4441 after oral administration against systemic infections with Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in mice was greater than that of ciprofloxacin.
TI  - [Survey on clinical isolates from 13 hospitals in Akita Prefecture--changes in frequency and susceptibility of isolates by scale of hospital. Survey Group for Clinical Isolates, Chemotherapy Research Committee of Akita Prefecture].
AB  - Isolates from various clinical materials in 13 hospitals in Akita prefecture and  their drug susceptibility were investigated by the Chemotherapy Research Committee of Akita Prefecture during the period from Dec., 1987 to Feb., 1988. The results were as follows: 1. The total number of isolates was 8,387, including Staphylococcus aureus (18.9%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10.9%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (7.3%) and Enterococcus faecalis (6.6%). S, aureus and P. aeruginosa were detected more frequently in the larger hospitals. 2. The detection frequency of S. aureus from the sputum, throat swab and pus exudate was also very high. There was a diversity in isolates from the urine and the frequency of Escherichia coli was low. More than half of the isolates from the blood were S. epidermidis and S. aureus. Many kinds of bacteria were detected from pleural fluid and ascites, but the isolate showed no particular tendency. 3. The susceptibility of S. aureus to oxacillin were variable in hospitals, and the susceptibility to cefazolin were even lower. Low susceptibility were also seen with norfloxacin. S. aureus showed the highest susceptibility to minocycline. The susceptibility was lower for inpatients than for outpatients. P. aeruginosa showed low susceptibility to cefsulodin. The number of ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae isolates tended to decrease. Enterobacter cloacae showed a low susceptibility for cephems. Serratia marcescens showed low susceptibility to many drugs. Based on the above results, we concluded that attention should be paid to S. aureus, P. aeruginosa and Enterobacter in clinical practice.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents. A study mainly focused on imipenem. Reported by the Research Group for Testing Imipenem Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (IPM) and other antibacterial agents at 64 hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1988. In this study, identification and susceptibility testing were carried out at each laboratory and the tests were performed according to the disk dilution method recommended by NCCLS in which susceptibilities are classified into "S", "MS", "I" and "R". IPM showed markedly high in vitro activities against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Salmonella spp., Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia rettgeri, Providencia stuartii, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, Alcaligenes spp., Peptococcus spp./Peptostreptococcus spp., Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides spp. IPM also had strong activities against Achromobacter xylosoxidans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but less active against Flavobacterium spp., E. faecium, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas cepacia. In a study in which activities of IPM against bacteria isolated from different clinical sources were compared, differences in susceptibilities were observed among S. aureus, CNS, A. calcoaceticus and P. aeruginosa, but such differences were not apparent among S. pneumoniae, E. faecalis, H. influenzae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, C. freundii, S. marcescens or P. mirabilis.
TI  - [Susceptibility of clinically isolated bacterial strains to imipenem/cilastatin sodium].
AB  - In vitro antibacterial activities of imipenem/cilastatin sodium (imipenem) and other beta-lactams against clinically isolated 353 bacterial strains were investigated. The results obtained in this study are summarized as follows: 1. Imipenem (IPM) showed potent antibacterial activities against Gram-positive cocci such as Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus agalactiae. 2. IPM had inferior or equivalent antibacterial activities to beta-lactams against clinically isolated Enterobacteriaceae, that is, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes and Proteus spp. 3. IPM showed potent antibacterial activities against clinically isolated Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter anitratus but not against Xanthomonas maltophilia.
TI  - [Clinical study of S 6472 in urinary tract infection].
AB  - Clinical studies on S 6472, a longer lasting preparation of cefaclor (CCL), were  performed and the following results were obtained. S 6472 was administered orally to 102 patients with urinary tract infections including 16 with acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis, 32 with acute uncomplicated cystitis, 31 with complicated pyelonephritis and 23 with complicated cystitis. 95 patients were treated with 375 mg of S 6472 2 times daily and 7 patients were treated with 750 mg of S 6472 2 times daily. The overall clinical efficacy was evaluated on the basis of the criteria proposed by the Japanese UTI Committee. 1. Clinical efficacies in 11 cases of acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis were excellent in 10 and moderate in 1, with an overall efficacy rate of 100%. Bacteriologically, all 12 strains identified in the acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis cases were eradicated, with an eradication rate of 100%. 2. Clinical efficacies in 21 cases of acute uncomplicated cystitis were excellent in 17, moderate in 3 and poor in 1, with an overall efficacy rate of 95%. As to bacteriological responses, 22 strains identified in the acute uncomplicated cystitis cases (except 1 of Escherichia coli) were eradicated, with an eradication rate of 95%. 3. Clinical responses in 43 cases of complicated urinary tract infections were excellent in 20, moderate in 15 and poor in 8, with an overall efficacy rate of 81%. Bacteriologically, 39 strains, including only one strain of P. aeruginosa, in the complicated urinary tract infection cases (except 4 of E. coli, 1 of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 1 of Enterococcus faecalis and 2 of Enterobacter cloacae) were eradicated, with an eradication rate of 83%. As side effects, slight stomatitis and gastric discomfort were noted in 1 patient each but we were able to continue the medication. Abnormal laboratory test values found were: 1 case of a slight and transient increase of lymphocytes in peripheral blood and 1 case of a slight and transient increase of serum creatinine level.
TI  - Intravenous ofloxacin in severe infections.
AB  - The efficacy and tolerance of intravenous ofloxacin was studied in 70 patients suffering from soft tissue infections (n = 33), intra-abdominal abscesses (n = 14), septicaemia (n = 12), pneumonia (n = 9) and brucellosis (n = 2). The average daily dose was 6 mg/kg divided into two doses. Pathogens treated included Enterobacter cloacae (n = 14), Escherichia coli (n = 12), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 13), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 11), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 10), Enterococcus faecalis (n = 8) and Streptococcus spp. (n = 5). Most patients had several underlying diseases. Most of the patients had received other antibiotic therapy without success. Clinically, 41% were considered cured, 19% improved and 30% failed to respond. Bacteriologically, pathogens were eradicated in 52.5% and persisted in 22.5%. Adverse reactions included an anaphylactoid reaction, abnormal liver function (n = 13) and insomnia (n = 2). This study suggests that higher doses of ofloxacin may be needed in deep seated infections.
TI  - Separation of antibiotics by autofocusing.
AB  - The autofocusing separation of nine antibiotics was investigated: tetracycline and chloramphenicol in large-scale batches, and seven others in gram preparation amounts. All except one were found to be heterogeneous in autofocusing, and 2-4 well-characterized fractions emerged. These heterogeneities are described and the industrial utilization of the procedure is suggested.
TI  - An investigation of indirect conductimetry for detection of some food-borne bacteria.
AB  - Indirect conductimetry using a rapid automated bacterial impedance technique was  investigated. Strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Aeromonas hydrophila and Salmonella spp. grown in Whitley Impedance broth all elicited indirect conductimetric changes. These indirect conductance responses were improved by the addition of 2 g/l glucose to the medium and resulted in maximum changes of 2340-4300 microS with associated maximum rates of change of 520-1210 microS/h. Furthermore, the indirect conductimetric assay detected growth of staphylococci, listeria and salmonella in media containing high concentrations of salts used as selective agents in culture media for the isolation of these organisms.
TI  - [Experimental study of the course of the immune response at the urinary level following repeated oral vaccination].
AB  - The Progression of the specific immunoreactions in the urines of rabbits vaccinated by oral route from 1 to 10 times with 20-40 billion of some antigens (E. coli, Proteus vulgaris, Staph aureus, Str. faecalis), administered daily or by-weekly, has been evaluated by agglutination and ELISA. The immunoenzymatic ELISA technique has revealed increases of specific immunoglobulins also one day after the first oral administration of the antigens and a final progression of IgA titres (after ten treatments) from 81% to 798%, according to the various antigens and the different posology. The highest values have been obtained using the posology of 40 billion and the bi-weekly sequence.
TI  - Effect of pefloxacin on microorganism: host cell interaction.
AB  - Recent evidence indicates that certain antibiotics affect bacterial adherence and phagocyte-micro-organism interactions. These interactions are important in the early stages of bacterial pathogenesis, that is, attachment to mucosal surfaces and invasion. Among the antibiotics of interest in this field are the fluoroquinolones. Sub-MICs of pefloxacin can alter the ability of Gram-positive cocci (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis) and Gram-negative bacilli (Escherichia coli) to adhere to different eukaryotic cells (uroepithelial and buccal cells) and to fibrin-platelet matrices. The mechanism by which pefloxacin reduces adhesion is not completely understood. However in the case of Esch. coli, the inhibition of haemagglutination and adherence corresponds to: (1) a decrease in production of fimbriae; (2) changes in the composition of outer membrane proteins; and (3) an effect on partition coefficient (carried out with the PEG/dextran system) which can be attributed to changes in electric and/or hydrophobic properties of the Esch. coli surface. The first step of phagocytosis is represented by adherence of opsonized bacteria to the membrane receptors of phagocytes. Consequently, the action of pefloxacin on phagocytosis is also of importance. Pretreatment of bacteria (Staph. aureus, Ent. faecalis, Esch. coli and Legionella pneumophila) with 1/4 the MIC of pefloxacin leads to an increase in uptake of the different strains by phagocytes (polymorphonuclear leucocytes and macrophages). Exposure of the phagocytes to 10 mg/l of pefloxacin enhances phagocytosis of strains that have not been pretreated. Finally, entry of antibiotics into phagocytic cells is a prerequisite for activity against intracellular organisms. The concentration of pefloxacin by polymorphs and macrophages is high (intracellular concentration/extracellular concentration = 5-10). Such findings correlate well with the intracellular activity of pefloxacin, demonstrated with guinea pig macrophages and different bacteria (Staph. aureus, L. pneumophila).
TI  - Growth inhibition of selected food-borne bacteria, particularly Listeria monocytogenes, by plant extracts.
AB  - Six extracts from Chinese medicinal plants: Tin Men Chu, Sey Lau Pai, Siu Mao Heung, Bak Tao Yung, Kam Chin Chiu and Liao Ya, were tested for their inhibitory effect on selected food-borne bacteria by the well assay technique. Among them, Tin Men Chu, Siu Mao Heung and Sey Lau Pai inhibited the growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumonia, Escherichia coli, Shigella flexneri, Streptococcus faecalis, Salmonella paratyphi, Salm. enteritidis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Proteus vulgaris, Alcaligenes faecalis, and three strains of Listeria monocytogenes. Two of these three extracts, Tin Men Chu and Siu Mao Heung, suppressed the growth of L. monocytogenes Scott A in cabbage juice. This inhibition was prevented by the addition of protein but not sodium chloride. Plant extracts show potential to control the growth of food-borne bacteria.
TI  - Conjugal transfer of plasmid pWBG637 from Staphylococcus aureus to Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - Plasmids pWBG636 (GmR) and pWBG642 (EmR) derived from the conjugative plasmid pWBG637 were tested for ability to transfer conjugatively to Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli. Both plasmids transferred to S. epidermidis and Strept. faecalis but not to B. subtilis and E. coli. Once in S. epidermis and Strept. faecalis they were transferred back to S. aureus. Restriction endonuclease analysis showed that the plasmids were stably maintained in S epidermidis and Strept. faecalis.
TI  - Quantitative changes in faecal microflora preceding necrotising enterocolitis in  premature neonates.
AB  - Quantitative studies of faecal bacterial flora were carried out during the week preceding the clinical onset of 12 episodes of neonatal necrotising enterocolitis. There were considerable quantitative changes in the faecal flora preceding the clinical onset of both definite and possible episodes of necrotising enterocolitis. There was a decline in the numbers of some species from up to 72 hours before the clinical onset of the disease. Enterobacteriaceae were isolated from samples collected during the 48 hours preceding the clinical onset of all four definite episodes of necrotising enterocolitis. These were 'new' isolates in two episodes, and considerably increased numbers in another. The changes that we found are probably the result of changes in intraluminal conditions that precede the clinical onset of necrotising enterocolitis.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents. A study mainly focused on imipenem. Research Group for Testing Imipenem Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - We investigated susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (IPM) and other antimicrobial agents at 459 hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1988. In this study, identification and susceptibility testing were performed at each hospital laboratory and the tests were carried out according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc technique in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, + and -. IPM had significantly high activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Salmonella spp., Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia rettgeri, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Moraxella catarrhalis, Alcaligenes spp., Peptococcus spp./Peptostreptococcus spp., Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides spp. and should slightly lower activities on coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), Enterococcus faecalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus vulgaris, Providencia stuartii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa than on the above mentioned bacteria. In a comparative study on activities of IPM against bacteria from different clinical sources, no remarkable differences were found due to different sources among S. pneumoniae, E. faecalis, H. influenzae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, C. freundii, P. mirabilis or A. calcoaceticus, whereas slight differences were found among Staphylococcus aureus, CNS, S. marcescens and P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Antimicrobial actions of calcium binding leucocyte L1 protein, calprotectin.
AB  - The calcium binding L1 protein was found to inhibit growth of blood culture isolates of Candida spp and cerebrospinal fluid isolates of Cryptococcus neoformans. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were 4-128 mg/l, and concentrations 2-4 times the MIC were fungicidal. Blood culture isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis had MIC values of 64-256 mg/l. Antibacterial activity was strongly influenced by the nature of the culture medium. In view of the biological activity of L1, the name calprotectin is proposed to describe this antimicrobial protein with calcium binding properties.
TI  - The role of Escherichia coli haemolysin in the pathogenic synergy of colonic bacteria in subcutaneous abscess formation in mice.
AB  - The growth of nine species of colonic bacteria--Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacteroides ovatus, Fusobacterium varium, Clostridium perfringens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Staphylococcus aureus and Bifidobacterium adolescentis--was examined after concomitant injection to form experimental subcutaneous abscesses in mice. Injection of a mixture of c. 10(5) cfu of each of the first five strains (E. coli, Ent. faecalis, B. ovatis, F. varium and C. perfringens) resulted in abscess formation in all mice tested when the E. coli strain was haemolytic. E. coli and B. ovatus multiplied and reached a maximum population of c. 10(8) cfu/abscess. When non-haemolytic E. coli was used, injection of greater than or equal to 10(7) cfu was required for abscess formation. The inclusion of partially purified E. coli haemolysin (125 HU50) with c. 10(5) cfu of bacteria including non-haemolytic E. coli resulted in abscess formation in most mice tested. These results indicate that E. coli haemolysin is one factor that may potentiate pathogenic synergy among colonic bacteria especially between E. coli and B. ovatus, during abscess formation.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence of the sex pheromone inhibitor (iAD1) determinant of Enterococcus faecalis conjugative plasmid pAD1.
AB  - The determinant for the peptide sex pheromone inhibitor iAD1 (iad) on the hemolysin/bacteriocin plasmid pAD1 of Enterococcus faecalis was sequenced. The sequence reveals a 22-amino-acid precursor with the carboxyl-terminal 8 residues corresponding to iAD1. It appears that iAD1 is a component of its own signal sequence.
TI  - Disinfection by endodontic irrigants and dressings of experimentally infected dentinal tubules.
AB  - The effect of endodontic irrigants and dressings was tested on bacteria in bovine dentin specimens experimentally infected with Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus sanguis, Escherichia coli, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Standardized, cylindrical dentin test pieces were prepared and cleaned by ultrasonic treatment with EDTA and sodium hypochlorite. The specimens were infected with the test organism for periods up to 14 days, and the degree of infection into the tubules was monitored using Brown & Brenn stain, scanning electron microscopy, and culturing of dentin dust from sequential bur samples starting from the pulpal side. E. faecalis rapidly infected the whole length of the tubules; S. sanguis required up to 2 weeks for complete infection; E. coli only penetrated to some 600 microns, even after prolonged incubation periods. P. aeruginosa infected dentin quickly, but apparently in very low numbers. E. faecalis persisted for at least 10 d after withdrawal of nutrient support, whereas the other 3 organisms died within 4 to 48 h. Endodontic medicaments were applied to infected specimen for comparison of antibacterial potency. Camphorated p-monochlorophenol was generally more efficient than Calasept, and of the irrigants tested, iodine potassium iodide appeared more potent than sodium hypochlorite or chlorhexidine. The presence of a smear layer delayed, but did not eliminate, the effect of the medicaments.
TI  - Amino acid sequence of pheromone-inducible surface protein in Enterococcus faecalis, that is encoded on the conjugative plasmid pPD1.
AB  - The major pheromone-inducible protein, PD78, believed to contribute to bacterial  conjugation, was purified from Enterococcus (formerly Streptococcus) faecalis cells containing the plasmid pPD1. A cloned EcoRI-BglII 3.6-kbp fragment of the plasmid pAM351(pPdl::Tn916) contained an open reading frame corresponding to 467 amino acid residues representing PD78. In a central region of the deduced protein, there is a repeated sequence of X-X-Pro that is repeated 15 times. This is analogous to the Gln-Gln-Pro repeat in the C-terminal region of TraD product encoded on the R100 plasmid in Escherichia coli.

TI  - Comparison of norfloxacin versus nalidixic acid in therapy of acute urinary tract infections.
AB  - Thirty-seven adult patients with acute urinary tract infections (UTI) were randomized to receive either a seven day (lower UTI) or a 14 day (upper UTI) course of norfloxacin 400 mg orally twice daily, or nalidixic acid 1 g orally four times per day. Mean age, underlying disease and infecting organisms were similar in the two groups. Nine patients in the norfloxacin group and seven in the nalidixic acid group had presumptive evidence of upper UTI. Overall, 12 patients had antibody-coated bacteria-positive infections. The infecting organisms were: Escherichia coli (27), coagulase-negative staphylococci (four), Citrobacter freundii (three), Klebsiella pneumoniae (three), and Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter agglomerans, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis (one of each). All of the organisms were susceptible to norfloxacin, while 81% were susceptible to nalidixic acid. The effects on the periurethral and anal canal flora were similar in both groups. Five patients in each group experienced adverse clinical effects. The cure rates for norfloxacin and nalidixic acid were 79 and 83%, respectively. There were two failures, two relapses and four reinfections in the norfloxacin group. In the nalidixic acid group, there were two failures, one relapse and four reinfections. One of the failure patients in the nalidixic acid group developed resistance to the drug, and two of the four reinfections were due to organisms resistant to nalidixic acid. In this patient population it was concluded that nalidixic acid may be as effective as norfloxacin in the treatment of acute, symptomatic UTI.
TI  - Nosocomial infections in general surgery: surveillance report from a German university clinic.
AB  - At the general surgery clinics, University of Giessen, we developed our own system for surveillance of nosocomial infections according to the guidelines of the Centers of Disease Control. Atlanta, USA, and according to the results of the SENIC Project. We wanted to receive information about the overall infection rate, the procedure specific infection rate, site specific infection rate, distribution of nosocomial infections by pathogen and resistance pattern of antibiotics at the general surgery clinics. The overall infection rate of operations, classified as clean, clean--contaminated, and contaminated and dirty, was 13%. The surgical wound infection rate of 3% after clean operations was mainly caused by an elevated infection rate of 13% after clean operations of a prolonged duration and hyperthermic perfusion of the extremities in patients with melanoma. There is also a difference in nosocomial infection rates at the general surgery ward (11%) and at the intensive care unit (29%). At the intensive care unit candida and coagulase negative staphylococci are mainly isolated whereas Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis dominated the general surgery ward. Different operations show different distributions of isolates; operations on the pancreas are prone to have infections with coagulase negative staphylococci, candida and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The antibiotic susceptibility tests for the most commonly used antibiotics revealed no resistance problems for E. coli, E. faecalis, and Staphylococcus aureus, common pathogens at the general surgery ward, but did for coagulase-negative staphylococci where we can consider only a few antibiotics like amikacin in obvious infections at the intensive care unit.
TI  - Maintenance of a neutral cytoplasmic pH is not obligatory for growth of Escherichia coli and Streptococcus faecalis at an alkaline pH.
AB  - Both Escherichia coli and Streptococcus faecalis grew in an alkaline medium containing 100 microM carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP). Our data suggested that CCCP functioned as a protonophore at a high pH and that the proton-motive force was dissipated almost completely under such conditions. The pH gradient measured with dimethyloxazolidine-2,4-dione and acetylsalicylic acid was very small in both bacteria at a high pH above 8, and was not affected significantly by the addition of CCCP. Based on these findings, we propose that the maintenance of neutral cytoplasmic pH is not obligatory for the growth of E. coli and S. faecalis in an alkaline medium.
TI  - In vitro susceptibilities of oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus to dapsone and sulfamethoxazole alone and in combination with trimethoprim.
AB  - The in vitro activity of trimethoprim plus dapsone against oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was comparable to that of trimethoprim plus sulfamethoxazole. Because of its different pharmacologic properties, dapsone may be a useful agent in combination with trimethoprim for the treatment of patients colonized with oxacillin-resistant S. aureus.
TI  - Differential rates of digestion of bacteria by freshwater and marine phagotrophic protozoa.
AB  - Differential decreases over time of two bacterial species, Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis, in a freshwater and a marine ecosystem were observed and explained by a differential rate of digestion of these bacteria by phagotrophic flagellates and ciliates. For this purpose, fluorescence-labeled bacteria (FLB) were used and prepared from the two species cited above. The number of FLB was observed for 5 days in fresh and marine waters in the presence or absence (0.2-mum-pore-size-filtered water) of natural microbiota. These experiments showed a longer persistence of Enterococcus faecalis FLB as opposed to Escherichia coli FLB in the presence of natural microbiota. Removal of FLB was due to protozoan grazing because no decrease of FLB number was observed in the absence of natural microbiota. In short-term (about 40 min) ingestion experiments, we found similar clearance rates of Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis FLB by assemblages of flagellates from the freshwater and the marine ecosystem and by cultured assemblages of ciliates from the marine ecosystem. Clearance rates of Enterococcus faecalis FLB were greater than those of Escherichia coli FLB for assemblages of ciliates from the freshwater ecosystem. Comparison of rates of ingestion and digestion of FLB by protozoa showed that Escherichia coli FLB were digested and ingested at similar rates. However, Enterococcus faecalis FLB were digested slower than they were ingested. These results suggest that a longer persistence of Enterococcus faecalis as opposed to Escherichia coli can be explained by a differential digestion by flagellates and ciliates in aquatic ecosystems. Moreover, rates of ingestion and digestion were strongly correlated for both FLB types.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from urinary tract infections (1987). II. Background of patients].
AB  - In the retrospective survey of the sensitivity of clinical isolates reported in this journal, patients' backgrounds were also investigated. Some findings are summarized below. 1. Age distribution by sex: Patients with ages 50 years and older accounted for a majority, irrespective of their sexes amounting 67.6% for both sexes combined. 2. Annual distribution of sexes by age group: Females accounted for a majority in younger age brackets, but the proportion of males increased with age, accounting for a majority in patients 70 years or older. This pattern has been repeated practically every year. 3. Distribution of infection types by sex: Complicated urinary tract infections were predominant in males, while simple urinary tract infections were more frequent in females. 4. Annual distribution of sexes by type of infection: Complicated and simple urinary tract infections combined accounted for approximately 70% in both males and females. This pattern has been repeated practically every year. 5. Distribution of infection types by age: Patients of advanced ages were predominant as a whole but this trend was particularly pronounced in complicated urinary tract infection cases. 6. Annual distribution of infection types by age: The frequency of simple urinary tract infections among patients older than 20 years of age declined with age and this pattern has been repeated practically every year. Among patients older than 20 years of age, annual frequencies of complicated urinary tract infections have been on the decrease. 7. Distribution of isolated bacteria by sex: Escherichia coli was more frequent in females, while Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were more frequent in males. Compared with the previous year, the frequencies of coagulase-negative staphylococci, Enterococcus spp., and E. coli increased, while that of P. aeruginosa decreased. 8. Distribution of isolated bacteria by age: E. coli was most frequent on the whole, followed by E. faecalis, P. aeruginosa, Klebsiella spp., and coagulase-negative staphylococci, in that order. By age group, E. coli was frequent in younger patients and the frequencies of E. faecalis and P. aeruginosa increased with age. 9. Annual distribution of isolated bacteria by infection type: Coagulase-negative staphylococci increased as a whole and P. aeruginosa and Serratia marcescens decreased compared to 1986, but E. coli continued to be the most frequent. E. coli was isolated from a majority of simple urinary tract infection cases. The frequencies of E. faecalis and P. aeruginosa were high in cases of complicated urinary tract infections.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from urinary tract infections (1987). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - Since 1979, Ikemoto et al. have been retrospectively surveying the sensitivity of major species of bacteria isolated from patients with urinary tract infections to various antibacterial agents and antibiotics. Their findings for the past year are reported below. A total of 825 clinical strains of bacteria was investigated. Of this total, Gram-positive bacteria accounted for 28.0% (231 strains) and Gram-negative bacteria for 72.0% (594 strains). Taxonomically, Escherichia coli accounted for 34.7% (286 strains), Enterococcus faecalis for 14.3% (118), Pseudomonas aeruginosa for 11.0% (91), Klebsiella pneumoniae for 7.8% (64), and coagulase-negative staphylococci for 7.3% (60). Sensitivity spectra of these major bacteria to various drugs were as follows. 1. E. faecalis was sensitive to parenteral imipenem (IPM) and ampicillin and oral vancomycin. It was also sensitive to ofloxacin (OFLX) and ciprofloxacin (CPFX), which are new quinolones. Some strains were only slightly sensitive to second and third generation cephems cefmenoxime (CMX) and cefuzonam (CZON) aminoglycosides amikacin (AMK) and arbekacin (HBK), and erythromycin which is a macrolide. 2. Staphylococcus aureus was sensitive to dicloxacillin (MDIPC) which is a penicillin drug, cefotiam (CTM) which is a cephem, IPM, minocycline (MINO), and HBK. A fairly large number of strains were only slightly sensitive to cefazolin (CEZ), OFLX and CPFX. 3. Coagulase-negative staphylococci were sensitive to MDIPC which is a penicillin derivative, cephems CTM and CZON, IPM, HBK, clindamycin (CLDM) and MINO. Some strains, however, were only slightly sensitive to a majority of these drugs. 4. E. coli was sensitive to CTM, CMX, latamoxef (LMOX), ceftazidime (CAZ), CZON, and flomoxef (FMOX), all of which are second or third generation cephems. It was also sensitive to IPM, a carbapenem, carumonam (CRMN), a monobactam, and new quinolones, OFLX and CPFX. 5. K. pneumoniae was sensitive to cephems, viz. CTM, CAZ, CZON, FMOX and cefixime, CRMN which is a monobactam, IPM, a carbapenem and new quinolones, OFLX and CPFX. Some strains were only slightly sensitive to CTM, cefmetazole cefoperazone (CPZ), and FMOX. 6. Citrobacter freundii was sensitive to CRMN which is a monobactam, and new quinolones, OFLX and CPFX. Many strains were only slightly sensitive to cephems, viz. CEZ, CTM, CPZ and CAZ. 7. Enterobacter cloacae was sensitive to gentamicin and AMK which are aminoglycosides, but showed a bimodal pattern of sensitivity to CPZ, CAZ and CZON, all of which are cephems, and to quinolones, OFLX and CPFX.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Transformation of Lactobacillus helveticus subsp. jugurti with plasmid pLHR by electroporation.
AB  - Lactobacillus helveticus subsp. jugurti was transformed with plasmid, pLHR (8.5 kilobases), by electroporation. The plasmid, pLHR, consists of a cryptic plasmid, pLJ1, from L. helveticus subsp. jugurti, the Escherichia coli vector pBR329, and the erythromycin resistance gene of pAM beta 1 from Enterococcus faecalis. Maximum transformation efficiency of 1.3 x 10(4) transformants per microgram of DNA was obtained by exposure to a pulse with an exponential decay waveform at 4 kV/cm with 25 microF capacitance. The presence of glycine in the growth medium was essential for transformation. Plasmid DNA isolated from transformants had not undergone detectable rearrangements or deletions. In addition, it was found that L. helveticus subsp. jugurti has a restriction and modification system.
TI  - Cloning and heterospecific expression of the resistance determinant vanA encoding high-level resistance to glycopeptides in Enterococcus faecium BM4147.
AB  - Fragments of plasmid pIP816, which confers high-level glycopeptide resistance in  Enterococcus faecium BM4147, were cloned into a conjugative gram-negative-gram-positive shuttle vector. The resulting hybrids were transferred by conjugation from Escherichia coli to Enterococcus faecalis and Bacillus thuringiensis. A 4-kilobase EcoRI fragment from pIP816 was found to confer vancomycin resistance in these hosts but not in E. coli or Bacillus subtilis.
TI  - Conjugative plasmid transfer from Escherichia coli to Clostridium acetobutylicum.
AB  - The conjugation mechanism of IncP plasmids may be employed to mobilize small non-conjugative plasmids from Escherichia coli to a wide range of different organisms. This strategy has been adapted for use with the Gram-positive anaerobe, Clostridium acetobutylicum NCIB 8052. Several shuttle vectors containing replicons from pAM beta 1 (Enterococcus faecalis), pCB101 (Clostridium butyricum) or pWV01 (Streptococcus cremoris), together with the cis-acting oriT region of RK2, have been constructed, and transferred to and established in this organism. One of the vectors apparently contains a hot spot for insertion of IS1. Conjugative mobilization of plasmids from E. coli will provide a useful alternative to electroporation for effecting gene transfer to this industrially important anaerobe.
TI  - Therapeutic effects of cefpirome (HR 810) on experimental mixed infections with Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli in mice.
AB  - The therapeutic effects of cefpirome (HR 810), a new cephalosporin, on mixed infections induced in mice with Enterococcus faecalis HL1147 and Escherichia coli HL34 were compared with those of ampicillin (AMP), cefuzonam (CZON), and ceftazidime (CAZ). Cefpirome was more effective in protecting mice with systemic mixed infection (median effective dose, 52 mg/kg) than the other antibiotics (all more than 320 mg/kg). With increasing doses of cefpirome, the percentages of the animals having E. faecalis and E. coli bacteremia were decreased. CZON and CAZ reduced only E. coli, and AMP failed to reduce both strains. In the mice with urinary tract mixed infection, cefpirome and CZON (40 mg/kg x 5, s.c.) significantly decreased the cfu/g kidney (p less than 0.01 vs. nontreated control), while AMP and CAZ were active only against E. faecalis (p less than 0.05) and E. coli (p less than 0.01), respectively.
TI  - Biological characterization of a new radioactive labeling reagent for bacterial penicillin-binding proteins.
AB  - Radiolabeled penicillin G is widely used as the imaging agent in penicillin-binding protein (PBP) assays. The disadvantages of most forms of labeled penicillin G are instability on storage and the long exposure times usually required for autoradiography or fluorography of electrophoretic gels. We investigated the utility of radioiodinated penicillin V as an alternative reagent. Radioiodination of p-(trimethylstannyl)penicillin V with [125I]Na, using a modification of the chloramine-T method, is simple, high yielding, and site specific. We demonstrated the general equivalence of commercially obtained [3H]penicillin G and locally synthesized [125I]penicillin V (IPV) in their recognition of bacterial PBPs. Profiles of PBPs in membranes from Bacteroides fragilis, Escherichia coli, Providencia rettgeri, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, and Enterococcus faecium labeled with IPV or [3H]penicillin G were virtually identical. Use of IPV as the imaging agent in competition experiments for determination of the affinities of various beta-lactam antibiotics for the PBPs of E. coli yielded results similar to those obtained in experiments with [3H]penicillin G. Dried electrophoretic gels from typical PBP experiments, using IPV at 37.3 Ci/mmol and 30 micrograms/ml, exposed X-ray film in 8 to 24 h. The stability of IPV on storage at 4 degrees C was inversely proportional to specific activity. At 37.3 Ci/mmol and 60 micrograms/ml, IPV retained useful activity for at least 60 days at 4 degrees C. IPV represents a practical and stable reagent for rapid PBP assays.
TI  - Effects of incorporating ampicillin, bile salts and carbohydrates in media on the recognition and selection of Aeromonas spp. from faeces.
AB  - The effects of incorporating ampicillin, some bile salts and sugars into media on the primary recognition and selection of aeromonads from faeces were examined. Most (88%) of the 101 Aeromonas strains examined had an ampicillin MIC of greater than or equal to 40 mg/L, and would be isolated on blood agar containing ampicillin 30 mg/L. The strains with an ampicillin MIC of less than 40 mg/L were all of human origin and predominantly A. caviae. Although ampicillin at 10, 20 or 30 mg/L in blood agar inhibited faecal bacteria, the ability to detect Aeromonas strains with a high ampicillin MIC was less when the lower concentrations of ampicillin were used, without any improvement in the isolation of those strains with a low ampicillin MIC. Thirty-seven strains were tested for sensitivity to several different bile salts and found to be at least as resistant to them as Escherichia coli NCTC 10418. Bile salt sensitivity was not related to the species or source of a strain. There were minor differences in sensitivity to bile salts between some strains which related to whether strains had been isolated originally in the presence of bile salt or not. The effects of the presence of E. coli, Klebsiella spp. and Enterococcus faecalis on the growth of Aeromonas strains in mixed culture on media with and without carbohydrate were examined. The colony size of some Aeromonas strains was reduced in mixed culture but colony counts were not affected with any Aeromonas strains.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - A transferable plasmid associated with AS-48 production in Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - Enterococcus faecalis S-48 produces a peptide antibiotic, AS-48, and a bacteriocin, Bc-48. We have isolated mutants that lack these inhibitory characteristics. Further analysis of the mutants indicates that a plasmid of 56 kilobases (pMB2) may harbor the genes for AS-48. In conjugation experiments, pMB2 has been transferred into a plasmid-free OG1X strain of E. faecalis. The OG1X(pMB2) transconjugant produces the antibiotic AS-48 in solid medium, and the MIC of AS-48 for this strain is the same as that of the donor strain.
TI  - Enterococcal sepsis and lung microvascular injury in sheep.
AB  - In a common bile duct contamination model, we studied the effect of Streptococcus faecalis compared with Escherichia coli in sheep with chronic lymph fistulas to investigate the role of enterococcus in acute lung injury and acute sepsis. Early pulmonary hypertension in the E coli group was not expressed in the S faecalis group, probably due to a failure of S faecalis to illicit a thromboxane A2 response. In the late period, E coli was associated with significantly greater lung microvascular damage compared with S faecalis. The lack of difference between groups with respect to complement activation suggests the action of chemotactic factors, in addition to complement, mediating granulocyte aggregation, and neutropenia. In this model, S faecalis demonstrated limited pathogenicity as expressed in lung microvascular injury compared with E coli.
TI  - [Studies of aztreonam in neonates].
AB  - Absorption and excretion of aztreonam (AZT) in neonates were studied and its clinical evaluation in 10 cases of neonates was performed using 1 hour intravenous drip infusion. 1. Serum concentrations of AZT in 7 neonates younger than 11 days of age were lower than those in infants. 2. Serum concentrations of AZT in 5 neonates given 20 mg/kg reached their peaks at the end of intravenous drip infusion with an average value of 45.8 +/- 10.41 micrograms/ml, and T 1/2 was 2.77 +/- 0.32 hours on the average. 3. Serum concentrations of AZT in 2 neonates given AZT 25 mg/kg reached their peaks at the end of intravenous drip infusion at 31.1 and 33.4 micrograms/ml with little difference from the 20 mg/kg group. Half-lives of serum AZT in the 2 cases were 1.87 hours and 3.23 hours, respectively. 4. Urinary excretion rates of AZT in 7 neonates younger than 11 days of age in the first 6 to 8 hours after the administration were 18.8 to 50.0%, or 31.7% on the average, which was lower than the average excretion rate found with infants. 5. All the cases given AZT showed clinical results rated better than "effective". Effect of AZT was excellent on 3 UTI cases caused by Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, but bacterial replacement (superinfection) of Enterococcus faecalis was observed when AZT was administered. 6. Transient elevations of GOT and GPT were seen in 2 cases when AZT administration was continued at length. Clinical side effect was not observed. 7. The most appropriate dosage and administration scheme of AZT against Gram-negative infections in neonates seems to be 40-60 mg/kg/day, b.i.d. or t.i.d.
TI  - Efficacy of sulbactam in an in vitro model of mixed aerobic/anaerobic infections.
AB  - Bacterial interactions in mixed infections may interfere with antimicrobial therapy. The in-vitro efficacy of ampicillin alone, combination sulbactam/ampicillin, and metronidazole was studied. Strains of Bacteroides fragilis, Escherichia coli, and Enterococcus faecalis, alone and in association, were tested by means of a broth dilution method. Minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBC) of ampicillin for B. fragilis 74 in association with E. coli 68 were up to 16-fold higher than for B. fragilis 74 alone (256 compared to 16 mg/l), but only 2-fold higher for sulbactam (5 mg/l)/ampicillin (0.5 and 0.25 g/l). Association of B. fragilis 45 and E. faecalis 186 increased ampicillin MBC of E. faecalis 186 from 2 to 16 mg/l, but the combination sulbactam/ampicillin restored activity of ampicillin. In association with E. faecalis, metronidazole MBCs of B. fragilis increased up to 64-fold. Strains of E. faecalis and E. coli were able to destroy 10 mg/l metronidazole within 8 to 20 h. The present experiments demonstrated effectiveness of sulbactam/ampicillin to inhibit beta-lactamases of associated pathogens. Destruction of metronidazole by E. faecalis lends additional support to the use of the combination in aerobic/anaerobic infections including E. faecalis.
TI  - Transfer and expression of the tetracycline resistance transposon Tn925 in Acetobacterium woodii.
AB  - The Enterococcus faecalis conjugative plasmid pCF10 was used to introduce Tn925 into Acetobacterium woodii by filter mating. Tetracycline resistance was transferred at frequencies of about 10(-6) per donor, but no plasmid DNA was found in the transconjugants. DNA hybridization analyses of HindIII-digested chromosomal DNA demonstrated the insertion of Tn925 at a variety of locations, whereas wild type DNA showed no hybridization at all. The transconjugants were used as donor in mating experiments with tetracycline-sensitive Bacillus subtilis. Transfer of tetracycline resistance was observed at frequencies of 10(-8) per recipient.
TI  - Physical characterisation of the replication region of the Streptococcus faecalis plasmid pAM beta 1.
AB  - The complete nucleotide (nt) sequence of a 5.1-kb EcoRI DNA restriction fragment  carrying the replication region of the Streptococcus faecalis plasmid pAM beta 1 has been determined. Of the seven major open reading frames (ORF A-G) identified within this fragment, two (C and E) were shown to be encoding by in vitro transcription/translation assays. Evidence was obtained that synthesis of the polypeptide (Mr 57,380) encoded by the largest ORF (E) was essential for replication. Deletion analysis indicated that the minimum unit of DNA required for replication resided on a 2.59-kb AccI-HpaI subfragment. ORF C resided outside of this fragment and encompassed an extensive region of directly repeated nt sequence. The encoded polypeptide (Mr 30,471) was therefore composed of large tracts of reiterated amino acid sequence (11 x VDP and 35 x TEP tripeptides) which probably caused the observed anomalous electrophoretic mobility of the synthesised protein (equivalent to 61 kDa). Deletion of a 416-bp segment of DNA between unique KpnI and StyI sites caused an increase in copy number, which correlated with the in vitro production of higher levels of ORF E polypeptide. Although homology was detected between the sequenced DNA, and the replicon of a closely related streptococcal plasmid (pSM19035), none was evident to any other characterised Gram+ plasmid.
TI  - In vitro activity of Ro 23-9424, a dual-action cephalosporin, compared with activities of other antibiotics.
AB  - The in vitro activity of Ro 23-9424, which is desacetyl-cefotaxime linked to fleroxacin, was compared with the activities of cefotaxime, desacetyl-cefotaxime, fleroxacin, ofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin. It inhibited the majority of members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, except for some Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter freundii, and Enterobacter cloacae strains, at less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml and had an MIC for 90% of strains tested (MIC90) of 8 micrograms/ml against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Most group A, B, C, and G streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited at less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml. Ninety percent of the staphylococci were inhibited at less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml, except for some methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolates. The MIC90S of Ro 23-9424 for Enterococcus faecalis and Listeria monocytogenes were greater than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml. Ninety percent of Clostridium perfringens isolates were inhibited by less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, whereas Bacteroides fragilis had an MIC90 of 32 micrograms/ml. There was a minimal inoculum size effect. The MICs and MBCs were either identical or within a twofold dilution. The MICs of Ro 23-9424 for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus increased 16- to 128-fold after 2 weeks of transfer in the presence of Ro 23-9424, showing that the presence of two agents does not prevent resistance.
TI  - [Studies on delayed skin reactivity to streptococci in Behcet's disease].
AB  - Delayed type hypersensitivity of patients with Behcet's disease was investigated  by intradermal skin test and prick test, using various inactivated microorganisms as antigens. In the intradermal skin test, 13 patients showed significantly increased skin reactivity to E. faecalis, compared with 5 normal controls. No significant differences were observed between these two groups in terms of reaction to S. pyogenes. Prick test was performed in 11 patients and 6 controls, using S. pyogenes, S. sanguis, S. salivarius and E. faecalis as antigens. It was shown that patients with this disease had significantly greater skin reactions to crude cell wall antigens, as well as to whole cell antigens of these streptococci than the controls. The antigenicity of streptococci seemed to be present mainly in the cell wall fragment, and these streptococci seemed to have cross reactivity with each other. These results suggest that streptococci may have some significant role in the immunopathogenesis of this disease.
TI  - In vitro investigation of BK-218, a new oral and parenteral cephalosporin.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of BK-218 was similar to that of cefamandole when it was tested against several laboratory strains. The inhibiting effect of BK-218 was greater than that of cephalexin and cefoxitin on penicillin-binding proteins of Escherichia coli HB101. This result was in close correlation with the relative inhibition of radiolabeled glucosamine incorporation (greatest with BK-218) and with the lytic effect (most intensive with BK-218). BK-218 proved to be a good inhibitor for all five of the beta-lactamases that were investigated, although two enzymes (Enterobacter cloacae P99 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa Cilote) hydrolyzed it to some extent.
TI  - Survival strategy of Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis in illuminated fresh and marine systems.
AB  - Some effects of visible light on Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis in natural freshwater and seawater were studied by plate counts, colony area measurements, and direct counts. A large number of somnicells (non-culturable cells) were noted in illuminated systems as compared with non-illuminated ones. Colony areas were significantly smaller in illuminated systems. Indirect activity measurements were used to test the effects of visible light on the ability of E. coli and Ent. faecalis to metabolize substrates ([14C]glucose) in natural waters. In illuminated systems, a decrease of glucose uptake was observed. When percentages of assimilation and respiration with respect to the total glucose uptake were analysed a decrease of assimilation percentages and an increase of respiration percentages were observed. In addition, differences in glucose uptake, assimilation and respiration by enteric bacteria were detected for E. coli at the beginning of the experiments between fresh- and seawater and these were interpreted as a toxic effect exerted by seawater on E. coli cells. Differences between species, natural waters and parameters studied (excepting glucose assimilation) were detected in the illuminated systems. We concluded, however, that enteric bacteria under visible light illumination show a general survival strategy characterized by reaching progressively a somnicell stage which can be defined in terms of their (1) inability to form colonies on standard bacteriological media, (2) inability to incorporate substrates, and (3) inactivation of biosynthetic processes.
TI  - The evaluation of urine pH in screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy.
AB  - The purpose of this prospective investigation was to determine whether an alteration in urine pH, either by itself or in combination with other rapid screening tests, could be used to identify asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnant women. Clean catch urine specimen was used to evaluate 510 asymptomatic obstetric patients. Urine specimens were tested for pH, leukocyte esterase activity, and the presence of nitrites. The pH, leukocyte esterase activity, and nitrite reaction were evaluated singly and in combination to determine if these variables could be used to predict significant bacteriuria. Twenty-four (4.8%) patients had positive cultures for E. coli. The mean pH of the infected population was not significantly different from that of the uninfected population. The performance parameters of pH, singly and in combination with the leukocyte esteras and nitrite status, were poor. We concluded that the identification of urine pH is not of value in detecting asymptomatic bacteriuria.
TI  - [Changes in phagocytosis of aerobic bacteria by neutrophils after exposure to subinhibitory concentrations of aztreonam and ciprofloxacin].
AB  - In the present research work we are performing a study on the effect of the antibiotic concentrations low minimal inhibitory concentration of aztreonam and ciprofloxacin on phagocytosis of aerobic bacteria by neutrophils (Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Both antibiotics induced an increased of phagocytosis by similar mechanisms. In our assay aztreonam and ciprofloxacin would not act directly on granulocyte but they would affect the bacteria increasing the opsonization and phagocytosis.
TI  - [Cefpiramide: antibacterial activity, pharmacokinetics, and clinical evaluation].
AB  - We determined MIC values of cefpiramide (CPM) against clinical isolates from 100  patients who were subjected to total hysterectomy between April 1986 and March 1988. We also investigated the concentrations of CPM in uterine tissue and assessed the clinical efficacy of postoperative prophylaxis. 1. Against bacteria isolated from clinical materials the MIC80 values of CPM were as follows: Staphylococcus epidermidis 1.56 micrograms/ml, Enterococcus faecalis 25 micrograms/ml, and Escherichia coli 6.25 micrograms/ml. 2. Peak concentrations of CPM in various tissues and tissue/serum ratios of AUC were as follows: cervix uteri 35 micrograms/g (39.5%), perimetrium 43 micrograms/g (44.9%), endometrium 39 micrograms/g (51.6%), myometrium 28 micrograms/g (26.8%), oviduct 67 micrograms/g (41.9%), and ovary 27 micrograms/g (45.8%). In all tissues examined CPM concentrations were above 4 micrograms/g after 600 minutes. 3. Serum half-lives were T 1/2(alpha) = 13.2 minutes and T 1/2(beta) = 260.2 minutes. 4. The efficacy rate in postoperative prophylaxis was 97.9%. 5. No serious side effects were observed.
TI  - Incidence and significance of intraperitoneal aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - Intra-abdominal infections frequently occur after trauma, surgical resections, or intrinsic diseases of the gastrointestinal tract. These infections, which can be generalized or localized in intraperitoneal or extraperitoneal locations as well as in organs, are often difficult to diagnose and treat. They are usually polymicrobial, involving both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. The average number of bacterial strains recovered is between two and five, with anaerobes dominating. The aerobic microorganisms most commonly recovered are Enterobacteriaceae (mainly Escherichia coli) and enterococci (mainly Enterococcus faecalis). Among the anaerobic microorganisms, Bacteroides fragilis, anaerobic cocci, and clostridia are usually isolated. Adequate surgical drainage and antimicrobial therapy improve the clinical course of intra-abdominal infections and reduce the risk of local complications and septicemia. The choice of antimicrobial agents should be based on the type of infection, the microorganisms most likely to be encountered, and the microbial sensitivity pattern of the clinic. The side-effect profile of the antimicrobial therapy should also be taken into consideration.
TI  - Therapeutic effects of cefpirome, a new cephalosporin, on various models of infections in mice and rats.
AB  - Cefpirome (HR 810) is a new cephalosporin with a 2,3-cyclopentenopyridine group in the 3-position side chain. It was compared with other cephem antibiotics in protective and therapeutic effects on various experimental infections, systemic and local, in mice and rats. HR 810 had more potent protective effect than ceftazidime (CAZ), cefoperazone (CPZ), and cefotaxime (CTX) on systemic infections induced by Escherichia coli Ec-31, Staphylococcus aureus SMITH, and Serratia marcescens Sm-6 in mice. Against systemic infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa HR 810 was as effective as CAZ. Mice with leukopenia induced by cyclophosphamide were systemically infected with methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA), Enterobacter cloacae, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and Enterococcus faecalis. HR 810 was superior to cefuzonam (CZON) and cefmetazole against MRSA and MSSA and was much more active than any other antibiotics tested against E. cloacae and A. calcoaceticus. In the activity against E. faecalis, HR 810 was inferior to ampicillin but superior to CZON. In mice with pyelonephritis caused by E. coli Ec-7, the rank order of activities was HR 810 greater than CAZ greater than CTX greater than CPZ. HR 810 was more effective than latamoxef, CAZ, CTX, and CPZ in improving lung infections induced by Streptococcus pneumoniae HL 438 and Klebsiella pneumoniae Kp-51 in mice. HR 810 was superior to CTX and CPZ and comparable to cefazolin in therapeutic effects on intrauterine infections with E. coli Ec-89 and S. aureus SMITH in rats.
TI  - Genetic analysis of the pAD1 hemolysin/bacteriocin determinant in Enterococcus faecalis: Tn917 insertional mutagenesis and cloning.
AB  - Thirty-seven nonhemolytic/nonbacteriocinogenic mutations in Enterococcus (Streptococcus) faecalis plasmid pAD1 were generated by Tn917 insertion. All were found to belong to one of two complementation classes. Each class of mutants secreted either hemolysin/bacteriocin (Hly/Bac) component A or L into the culture medium. DNA encoding Hly/Bac was cloned in Escherichia coli in which both components of the hemolysin were expressed individually and collectively. The region encoding components A and L was further defined by deletion analysis and physically mapped. A total of approximately 8.4 kilobases of pAD1 DNA were observed to be required for hemolysin expression. Hly/Bac activity of the wild-type and the inactive L substance was observed to be heat stable. Active Hly/Bac resulting from incubating separately secreted components A and L was also found to be heat stable. The results indicate that component A activates component L and that activated component L possesses the Hly/Bac activity. Component A was also observed to be associated with host immunity to the Hly/Bac.
TI  - [The distribution of and methods for detecting Pseudomonas aeruginosa in mineral  waters].
AB  - The value of different methods of P. aeruginosa identification in mineral water has been studied and compared. Natural studies indicate great contamination of balneological technical systems with P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Radio-immunoassay for formyl methionyl leucyl phenylalanine. I. Development and application to assessment of chemotactic peptide production by enteric bacteria.
AB  - Bacterial chemotactic peptides are low molecular weight peptides which stimulate  a wide range of neutrophil functions following binding to specific leucocyte receptors. Formyl methionyl leucyl phenylalanine (FMLP) is the major chemotactic peptide in Escherichia coli culture supernatants. This paper reports the development and validation of a radio-immunoassay (RIA) for FMLP and its application to the analysis of formyl peptide production by enteric bacteria in vitro. The assay was moderately sensitive (10 nmol/L FMLP) and highly specific showing cross reactivity with F-met-leu-tyr, F-nle-leu-phe and F-met-met-met sequences (ID50 = 200, 100 and 250 nmol/L, respectively) but no significant cross reactivity with non-formylated or other formylated di- and tri-peptides (ID50 = 10(5) nmol/L. Culture supernatants from five species of enteric bacteria were filtered, concentrated and fractionated by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography before RIA. All five organisms produced immunoreactive F-met peptides. A major peak of immunoreactivity co-chromatographing with authentic FMLP was found in all supernatants, but additional peaks representing more hydrophobic peptides were found in Streptococcus faecalis and Bacteroides fragilis cultures. In E. coli culture supernatants, concentration of immunoreactive FMLP increased in a linear fashion during 3 h of log phase growth reaching 31.2 nmol/L(s.e.m. = 10) with final bacterial concentrations of 3 +/- 0.73 x 10(8)/mL (n = 6). These findings extend earlier work showing production of bioactive formyl oligopeptides by different species of enteric bacteria and suggest that a RIA for FMLP will be a useful tool for investigating the production and metabolic fate of such peptides in man.
TI  - A model for aggregation-dispersion dynamics of a population.
AB  - An important feature that distinguishes the movement of living systems from the random motion of inorganic material is a delicate balance between spreading and concentrating. This movement is based on the kind of interactions which a bacterial colony may establish during migration. Namely, the antagonistic effects of dispersal which take place preferentially down the population gradient and the tendency in grouping together. In this work a model is proposed which considers these effects. The phase plane analysis and the numerical calculations reveal the existence of stable sharp wave front solutions. The speed of the wave front is modulated by the compromise between the tendencies of spreading and aggregating. The results obtained were compared with experimental observations in cultures of Escherichia coli and Streptococcus faecalis. The agreement between both types of results supports the hypothesis on which the model was based.
TI  - Inhibitory activity of papain on facultative pathogens--short communication.
AB  - Papain, a proteolytic enzyme obtained from papaya was found inhibitory on few facultative pathogens. While Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus albus, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae were inhibited at concentration from 200 ppm on the cell density of Staphylococcus faecalis decreased only at higher concentration of papain (400-800 ppm).
TI  - Studies on the synthesis, characterisation and antimicrobial activity of new Co(II), Ni(II) and Zn(II) complexes of Schiff base derived from ninhydrin and glycine.
AB  - For the first time, Co(II), Ni(II) and Zn(II) complexes have been synthesized involving an intermediate Schiff base, indane-1,3-dione-2-imine-N-acetic acid the condensed product of ninhydrin and glycine. These coloured complexes were characterised by elemental analysis, molar conductivity, thermogravimetric analyses/differential thermal analysis, infrared, magnetic susceptibility, NMR and electronic spectral studies. Mechanisms for their formation have been proposed. The experimental studies reveal that the complexes possess octahedral stereochemistry whereas the Schiff base behaves as a monobasic tridentate ligand. A molecular structure for the metal complexes is also proposed. A comparative study of the antimicrobial activity of ninhydrin and the corresponding metal complexes against Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis has been undertaken and the results are discussed.
TI  - Genetic stability of the antagonistic character of Enterococcus faecalis ssp. liquefaciens and the detection of a new inhibitory bacteriocin-like substance.
AB  - The inhibitory capacity of strain S-48 of Enterococcus faecalis ssp. liquefaciens was studied. The strain produces a broad-spectrum peptide antibiotic (AS-48) that has been characterized elsewhere. The isolation of mutants from S-48 after mutagenic treatment revealed another inhibitory substance which remained masked in the wild strain. The protein nature and restricted spectrum of this substance points to its being a bacteriocin.
TI  - [Evaluation of microbial indicators of health risk related to river swimming places].
AB  - A retrospective follow-up study was conducted among 5,737 tourists in 8 holiday camps, during the 1986 summer, in the Ardeche river basin, in order to study the relationship between the bacteriological water quality and the morbidity that occurred to swimmers. Total morbidity was more frequent among bathers than non-bathers (Risk Ratio = 1.7 [95% confidence interval = 1.4-2.1]); gastro-intestinal illness was the major type of morbidity (RR = 2.8 [1.8-4.4] for "objective gastro-intestinal diseases). After screening for the germs that were best correlated with gastro-intestinal and skin diseases, using simple linear regression, logistic regression models allowed confirmation that fecal streptococci best predicted gastro-intestinal morbidity; it significantly exceeded the risk observed among non-bathers above a concentration of 20 SF/100 ml ("objective" gastro-intestinal morbidity). The relationship with fecal coliforms was less clear. However, they are good indicators of skin diseases risk. These results should help re-evaluation of the current microbiological standards concerning recreational waters.
TI  - [The in vitro activity of veterinary antiseptics].
AB  - The in vitro activity of 28 veterinary antiseptic drugs was studied on 4 bacterial strains either with or without calf serum. Eight preparations (VT Dose, Dulcidrine, Collyre Clement, Cronic, Detecaine, Lotion Maudor, Tano-Patt, Aurikan), half of which were eye-lotions, were found to be non antiseptic according to AFNOR standards. In the presence of calf serum, 4 other preparations (Albacetine, Nybocaine, Pediplasme, Pedifort) did not meet the standard NF T 72.171 criteria.
TI  - Hatching eggs sanitized with chlorine dioxide foam: egg hatchability and bactericidal properties.
AB  - The efficacy of chlorine dioxide (ClO2) as an alternative sanitizing agent for hatching eggs was investigated because of the health concerns about formaldehyde fumigation. Hatchability of chicken eggs was reduced when the eggs were dipped in the ClO2 solutions for more than 5 minutes or in concentrations greater than 100 ppm Cl. However, treating hatching eggs with a ClO2 foam or fumigating with formaldehyde had no adverse effect on hatchability compared with untreated control eggs. Sanitizing soiled duck eggs with ClO2 foam improved hatchability by more than 10% and hatch by more than 6% compared with untreated eggs (P less than 0.05). A novel method for assessing bactericidal potential of egg-sanitizing agents was developed. Using this technique, both chlorine dioxide foam and formaldehyde fumigation reduced the number of egg-contaminant bacteria inoculated on sterile chicken eggs compared with the number of bacteria on untreated eggs (P less than 0.05). These findings suggest that sanitizing hatching eggs with ClO2 foam may be a viable alternative to fumigating with formaldehyde.
TI  - Interactions between antibiotics and antineoplastic drugs on antibacterial activity in vitro.
AB  - The effects of various combinations of antibacterial (ampicillin, cephadroxil, doxycycline, imipenem, trimethoprimsulfadiazine) and antineoplastic (cisplatin, epirubicin, mitoxantrone) drugs were evaluated in vitro with regard to antibacterial activity on five clinical isolates from cancer patients of respectively Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis. With one exception no significant effects on the bacterial growth were observed in the presence of the antitumor drug alone. In contrast, all five strains of Strept. faecalis grew better when mitoxantrone was included in a concentration of 0.1 mg/l. A synergistic action between imipenem and mitoxantrone was seen for single strains of Staph. aureus and E. coli. Furthermore, a dose-effect related inhibition by cisplatin on the growth of Strept. faecalis in the presence of sub MIC levels of trimethoprimsulfadiazine was observed. The study indicates that interaction between antibacterial and antineoplastic drugs is an erratic phenomenon, which has to be dealt with separately for each combination of drugs as well as for each bacterial strain.
TI  - New screening test to determine the acceptability of 0.45-micron membrane filters for analysis of water.
AB  - During routine membrane filter (MF) quality control testing, irregularities such  as partial or complete inhibition of microbial growth at grid lines, abnormal spreading of colonies, growth in or along the grid lines, nonwetting areas, poor colony sheen and metallic sheen on the MF surface with mEndo agar, brittleness, decreased recovery, and severe wrinkling were observed with several lots of filters. To study these effects and to develop a more sensitive screening test for MF quality, we compared five different MFs with various types and degrees of defects by using five stock coliform cultures and five different media. Results showed that the Enterobacter aerogenes-tryptic soy agar test system detected more MF defects than any other combination did and was superior to the Escherichia coli-mFC agar American Society for Testing and Materials method for grid line inhibition. Filtered natural samples grown on the same media showed the same effects as were observed with the pure cultures. Poor colony sheen and sheen on the MF surface were best detected with Enterobacter aerogenes on mEndo agar. The use of tryptic soy agar and mEndo agar with this organism permitted the maximum detection of MF irregularities. Of the 142 MF lots tested by this method, 30% were acceptable, 10% were marginally acceptable, and 61% were unacceptable. This method provides a valuable screening test for determining the acceptability of 0.45-microm-pore-size MFs used for coliform and heterotroph analysis and may also be useful in conjunction with other methods.
TI  - Synthesis and structure-activity relationships of new 7-[3-(fluoromethyl)piperazinyl]- and -(fluorohomopiperazinyl)quinolone antibacterials.
AB  - Some novel 6-fluoro-7-substituted-1,4-dihydro-4-oxoquinoline-3-carboxylic acids have been prepared. At the N-1 position "standard" substitution was employed with the ethyl, cyclopropyl, and p-fluorophenyl groups being used. At C-7 the introduction of some novel piperazines was made. Most notably, 2-(fluoromethyl)piperazine (10) and hexahydro-6-fluoro-1H-1,4-diazepine (16, fluorohomopiperazine) at the quinolone C-7 position produced products with similar in vitro antibacterial activity as the ciprofloxacin reference. The in vivo efficacy of 1-cyclopropyl-6-fluoro-7-[3-(fluoromethyl)piperazinyl]-1,4-dihydro-4- oxoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid (20) was excellent with better oral absorption than ciprofloxacin (2).
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of cefmenoxime in infections of neonates].
AB  - Cefmenoxime (CMX) was evaluated for its absorption and excretion as well as for therapeutic effectiveness in neonates and premature infants. The following results were obtained. 1. Serum concentrations of the drug were examined in 3 premature infants 1 to 11 days old upon intravenous administration of about 10 mg/kg body weight (1st group), in 2 premature infants 18 and 32 days old and 1 neonate 17 days old upon intravenous administration of about 20 mg/kg (2nd group), and in 1 neonate 15 days old with meningitis upon intravenous administration of 45.2 mg/kg. Concentrations of CMX at 30 minutes after administration were 43, 29 and 27 micrograms/ml, respectively, in the 1st group, 46, 37 and 44 micrograms/ml, respectively, in the 2nd group and 208 micrograms/ml in the other neonate, and appeared to be dose-dependent. Concentrations of CMX at 6 hours after administration were 18.2, 6.6 and 8.1 micrograms/ml, respectively, in the 1st group, 9.6, 11 and 1.35 micrograms/ml, respectively, in the 2nd group and 5.2 micrograms/ml in the other subject. Serum half-lives were, respectively, 4.59, 2.85 and 3.48 hours in the 1st group, 2.52, 2.73 and 1.14 hours in the 2nd group and 1.0 hour in the other subject. Urinary recovery rates during the first 6 hours after administration were 45.8, 87.0, 50.2 and more than 100% in 4 cases examined. Two of these cases, in which recovery rates were 45.8 and 50.2%, were premature infants of low birth weight. Spinal fluid concentrations of the drug at 80 to 90 minutes after dosing to 1 neonate with purulent meningitis (causative organism presumed: Escherichia coli) given 48.3 mg/kg tended to decline gradually with the recovery of the disease, 3.8, 1.72 and 1.32 micrograms/ml on the 2nd, 6th and 8th day, respectively. 2. The drug was given to 9 neonates 0 to 24 days old. The therapeutic effectiveness on bacterial infections was evaluated in 7 cases (10 diseases) including 1 disease of purulent meningitis presumably caused by E. coli, 4 of septicemia caused by E. coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae (1, 2 and 1, respectively), 3 of urinary tract infection caused by E. coli, Serratia and Enterococcus faecalis (1 each), 1 of purulent parotitis caused by S. aureus and 1 of pneumonia (causative organism was unknown). Therapeutic efficacies were assessed as "Excellent" in all of meningitis, septicemia and urinary tract infection cases, and "Good" in 1 each of purulent parotitis and pneumonia cases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - The bactericidal effect of isoascorbic acid combined with mild heat.
AB  - The thermal inactivation of Salmonella thompson, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium perfringens, Candida zeylanoides, Enterococcus faecium and E. faecalis was accelerated by the addition of sodium isoascorbate (1 mmol/l) to phosphate-buffer heating medium but not to complex food mixtures. The lethal effect of isoascorbate was nullified by heating under anaerobic conditions or by the addition of catalase. The scavengers of hydroxyl radicals, mannitol and formate were not protective whereas histidine was. Histidine may have protected by slowing the rate of isoascorbate autoxidation, a property common to other amino acids tested. Superoxide dismutase was not protective. Dehydroascorbic acid also enhanced heat killing and its action was also reversed by catalase. The bactericidal effects of mild heat plus isoascorbate or dehydroascorbic acid both apparently depend on oxidative processes but their relative effectiveness was not related to their respective rates of oxygen consumption or peroxide production. We speculate that site-specific redox reactions, involving amino-carbonyl intermediates are involved in the inactivation mechanism.
TI  - The survival patterns of selected faecal bacteria in tropical fresh waters.
AB  - The survival of various faecal bacteria used as indicators of the faecal contamination of water supplies has been investigated in a tropical environment (Sierra Leone). Isolates representing the thermotolerant coliform (TtC) and faecal streptococcus (FS) groups, Clostridium perfringens and Salmonella spp. were studied over a 48 h period of immersion in water from three different sources. Survival patterns varied according to source type, but some general observations were made: a portion of the TtC group was apparently capable of substantial regrowth; FS organisms died off at a faster rate than TtC organisms initially, but survived longer; vegetative cells of C. perfringens died off rapidly; and Salmonella spp. could survive for as long as the other faecal organisms tested. The implications of results for the analysis of tropical waters for faecal contamination are discussed.
TI  - Comparative study of visual inspections and microbiological sampling in premises  manufacturing and selling high-risk foods.
AB  - The possible relationship between the results of a microbiological sampling programme and visual inspections carried out in local food-manufacturing premises was examined. Using five main parameters - overall appearance, personal hygiene, risk of contamination, temperature control, and training and education - a visual inspection rating score was established for each of the premises. A variety of high-risk processed foods, and specimens from hands, wiping cloths and environmental swabs were examined. The results from two study periods indicated that there was an overall poor agreement between microbiological results and inspection ratings. On its own, neither sampling nor visual assessment reliably monitored the performance of the premises. A combined approach, using selective microbiological examination to support a system of standardized inspections, is suggested for monitoring food hygiene standards in premises selling high-risk foods.
TI  - Nisin inhibits several gram-positive, mastitis-causing pathogens.
AB  - Organisms known to cause bovine mastitis, Enterococcus faecalis ssp. liquefaciens ATCC 27959, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29740, Streptococcus agalactiae ATCC 27956, Streptococcus equinus ATCC 27960, Streptococcus dysgalactiae ATCC 27957, Streptococcus uberis ATCC 27958, and the neotype Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 14990 were examined for their susceptibility to the small peptide antibiotic, nisin. Using a disc assay, minimum inhibitory concentrations of nisin ranged from 10 to 250 micrograms/ml among the strains. Examination of the antimicrobial effect of 50 micrograms/ml nisin in milk showed nisin inhibited all gram-positive pathogens tested.
TI  - Antibacterial and plasmid curing activity of lomefloxacin in vitro.
AB  - The in vitro activity of lomefloxacin in comparison to other recently developed quinolones was evaluated by determination of MICs for 89 test strains. Organisms tested included clinical isolates of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria susceptible or resistant to quinolones, resistant mutants of Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis obtained in vitro, and the wild type strain Escherichia coli K12 with its mutants na1A, nalB, nalC and nalB. The activity of lomefloxacin was similar to that of pefloxacin against gram-positive cocci and similar to that of norfloxacin against gram-negative bacteria. There was cross-resistance to all quinolones tested in pefloxacin resistant clinical isolates and in laboratory mutants. The activity of lomefloxacin was decreased against the Escherichia coli K12 mutants nalA and nalD but not nalB, whereas the nalC mutant showed increased susceptibility. Susceptible and mutant strains (n = 115) were used to establish the least-squares lines of regression with 5-micrograms and 10-micrograms lomefloxacin disks. Tests of the in vitro plasmid curing activity of lomefloxacin compared to other agents showed no statistically significant plasmid loss after treatment with lomefloxacin.
TI  - Ciprofloxacin in patients with bacteremic infections. The Spanish Group for the Study of Ciprofloxacin.
AB  - The efficacy and safety of ciprofloxacin in the treatment of 68 episodes of bacteremia were studied. Patients were treated intravenously (30 cases), orally (13 cases), or with sequential intravenous/oral therapy (25 cases). Intravenous doses ranged from 200 to 400 mg per day and oral doses ranged from 1,000 to 1,500 mg per day. According to the criteria of McCabe and Jackson, 39 cases had nonfatal and 29 had ultimately fatal underlying diseases. The clinical condition of patients at the start of therapy was critical or poor in 40 cases and fair or good in 28. Sixty-four of the 68 episodes of bacteremia were monomicrobial and the remaining four were polymicrobial. The causative micro-organisms were: Escherichia coli (18 episodes), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (13 episodes), Acinetobacter sp. (10 episodes), Salmonella sp. (seven episodes), Enterobacter sp. (six episodes), Proteus sp. (four episodes), Serratia sp. (four episodes), Haemophilus influenzae (three episodes), Klebsiella sp. (three episodes), Staphylococcus aureus (2 episodes), and Morganella morganii (two episodes). Overall clinical efficacy of ciprofloxacin was 94 percent (64 of 68 patients). Bacteremia persisted in four patients (failure rate of 6 percent). Five organisms persisted: Acinetobacter sp. (two patients), P. aeruginosa (one patient), Enterobacter sp. (one patient), and Serratia sp. (one patient). Side effects were phlebitis associated with intravenous administration (four cases), dizziness (four cases), and superinfection (six cases). Superinfecting organisms and sites were as follows: Enterococcus faecalis, wound (2 cases); Candida sp., urinary tract infection (one case); Acinetobacter anitratus (ciprofloxacin resistant), urinary tract infection (one case); Staphylococcus epidermidis, blood (one case); and Clostridium perfringens, blood (one case). Ciprofloxacin administered either intravenously, orally, or intravenously followed by the oral route is effective therapy in the treatment of severe bacteremic infections.
TI  - Immune response in patients with intraabdominal infections treated with imipenem. Swedish Study Group.
AB  - In the present investigation the humoral immune response against isolated microorganisms in patients treated with imipenem was studied. Sixty-six patients (34 men and 32 women, 18-86 years of age) with suspicion of intraabdominal infections entered the study. Five patients were excluded for various reasons and the remaining 61 patients were treated with imipenem/cilastatin 0.5-1.0 g t.i.d. for 5-29 days (median nine days). Three serum samples were taken from each patient, the first sample at admission, the second between three and seven days after the first dose of imipenem/cilastatin and the third between 14 and 31 days after the first dose. One third of the patients had a malignant disease and the verified intraabdominal infections were judged to be severe in 23 and moderately severe in 33 of the patients. Fifty-six patients (92%) were cured and five patients (8%) were considered improved after the treatment. The immune response against isolated microorganisms was measured in the three serum samples by indirect immunofluorescence tests and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Among the aerobic microorganisms isolated Escherichia coli (46 strains) Staphylococcus epidermidis (22 strains), Streptococcus milleri (15 strains) and Enterococcus faecalis (11 strains) dominated and among the anaerobic bacteria Bacteroides fragilis (39 strains). Thirty-two patients had significant immune responses against one or more of the isolated microorganisms. E. coli and B. fragilis gave rises in antibody titers in 13 and 20 cases respectively, while significant titers against S. epidermidis were noticed in only three cases, against S. milleri in two cases and against E. faecalis in three cases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach to estimating the effective administration dose of  imipenem/cilastatin. Evaluation of the disk susceptibility test and its interpretation system].
AB  - In vitro activities of imipenem/cilastatin (IPM/CS) against 413 clinical isolates were studied through the evaluation of MICs and the results of disk susceptibility tests. The MICs were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) CFU/ml. The MIC80s of imipenem (IPM) against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis were 25 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively, showing a bimodal MIC distribution. However, the distribution of MICs against other bacteria studied was of monomodal pattern. Group A Streptococcus, Enterococcus faecalis were inhibited by IPM at dose levels less than 0.025 and 6.25 micrograms/ml, respectively. IPM inhibited Escherichia coli at 0.20 microgram/ml, Klebsiella pneumoniae at 0.39 microgram/ml, Pseudomonas aeruginosa at 3.13 micrograms/ml except one strain showed a MIC of 25 micrograms/ml, Serratia spp. at 3.13 micrograms/ml except one with MIC greater than 100 micrograms/ml, Citrobacter freundii at 0.78 microgram/ml and Enterobacter spp. at 0.39 microgram/ml. Indole (-) Proteus and indole (+) Proteus were inhibited by this drug at levels of 3.13 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively. The reliability of the IPM disk diffusion susceptibility test in quantitative estimation of antimicrobial activities was well demonstrated using commercialized 8 mm diameter Showa disks containing 30 micrograms antibiotic and also disks containing 1-30 micrograms prepared in this laboratory. For the interpretation of the Showa disk susceptibility test, a 4 category system was used. In the 4 category system for Showa IPM disk the following classification of inhibitory zone diameters has been proposed; ( ) MIC less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, (++) MIC greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, (+) MIC greater than 15-60 micrograms/ml, (-) MIC greater than 60 micrograms/ml. The results of the test using Showa 30 micrograms disk against various clinical isolates were accurately classified into the 4 groups, showing false positive 8 out of 304 strains (2.6%) and false negative 1 of 304 strains (0.3%). With Showa 30 micrograms disks subclassification of strains with MIC less than 3 micrograms/ml cannot be achieved. In this study, however, the differentiation of strains with MICs less than 1 microgram/ml was made with disks containing 5-10 micrograms, which afforded to set MIC break points at 1 and 3 micrograms/ml. According to current concepts on pharmacokinetics for antibiotics including the penetration of drugs into tissues and inflammatory fluids, serum protein binding of drugs appears to be one of the important determinants of drug distribution in the body. Only free, unbound drug molecules can readily pass through capillary pores into tissue fluids except in the hepato-biliary system.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Efficacy of clavulanate-potentiated antibiotics against Bacteroides species and artificially associated cultures of aerobes and anaerobes.
AB  - Clavulanic acid is known to potentiate the activity of amoxycillin and ticarcillin against beta-lactamase-producing Bacteroides species. In order to assess the usefulness of the clavulanate antibiotics in mixed infections with aerobes and anaerobes, artificially associated cultures of clinically significant Bacteroides species and facultative anaerobes (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp.) were tested. The minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBC) of amoxycillin and ticarcillin, singly and in combination with clavulanate, were determined for the individual species in the associated culture and for the associated culture as a whole. In the absence of clavulanate, association experiments showed that the MBCs of susceptible strains increased in the presence of beta-lactamase-producing species, whereas the addition of clavulanate to the test systems led to MBCs which were mostly comparable to values as determined in single strain testing.
TI  - Genetic analysis of the conjugal transfer determinants encoded by the streptococcal broad-host-range plasmid pIP501.
AB  - pIP501 is a 30.2-kilobase (kb) broad-host-range conjugative streptococcal plasmid which encodes chloramphenicol and erythromycin resistance. A smaller conjugation-proficient derivative of pIP501 has been constructed and designated pVA1702. pVA1702 is 25.2 kb, encodes only kanamycin resistance, and confers conjugative ability in an Enterococcus faecalis mating system. The temperature-sensitive transposon delivery vectors pTV1ts and pTV32 carrying Tn917 and Tn917lac, respectively, were used to create insertion mutants of pVA1702 in E. faecalis. These insertions enabled us to localize the determinants conferring conjugation to two separate regions of pVA1702: the 7.5-kb region A and the 8.8-kb region B. A nested set of deletions of the 7.5-kb region was subcloned in Escherichia coli, and the expression of these deletions was examined in an E. coli minicell system. The genes for three conjugal proteins have been located and designated cnjA, cnjB, and cnjC (for conjugation). Two other peptides that are transcribed in a divergent direction from the cnj genes were encoded in the A region, but it is not known whether they are involved in conjugation. These studies indicate that the conjugation genes of pIP501 are arranged in multiple transcriptional units.

TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from urinary tract infections (1986). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - Susceptibilities to various antibacterial and antibiotic agents of bacterial strains isolated from urinary tract infections at 8 hospitals in Japan from July to October in 1986 are summarized as follows. 1. Enterococcus faecalis was susceptible to sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (ST) and imipenem (IPM) with MIC90s of 0.78 and 1.56 microgram/ml. Minocycline had the strongest activity against Staphylococcus aureus; the MICs for all strains tested were lower than 0.39 microgram/ml. The MIC80s of dicloxacillin, and arbekacin (HBK) were 0.20 and 0.78 microgram/ml, respectively. Among the cephems, the MIC80 of flomoxef was 25 micrograms/ml, whereas those of cefmenoxime (CMX) and cefotiam (CTM) were 50 micrograms/ml. 2. Escherichia coli was most susceptible to ofloxacin (OFLX) among the oral antibacterial and antibiotic agents tested. OFLX showed the minimum inhibitory concentration against 90% (MIC90) of the 274 strains of E. coli tested to be lower than 0.10 microgram/ml. The antibacterial activities of the third generation cephems such as CMX and latamoxef (LMOX) were the strongest among the injectable antibiotics tested. The MIC90s of CMX and LMOX were lower than 0.10 and 0.20 microgram/ml, respectively. CTM and cefmetazole, the second generation cephems, were also highly active against E. coli with MIC90s of 0.39 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively. 3. Among the oral antibacterial and antibiotic agents tested, OFLX was the most active against Klebsiella pneumoniae. Its MIC90 was 0.78 microgram/ml. Among the injectable antibiotics tested, CMX was the strongest with an MIC90 of 0.20 microgram/ml; MIC90 of CTM and LMOX were 0.39 microgram/ml. 4. The tested antibacterial and antibiotic agents were generally less active against Citrobacter freundii than against other bacteria. The MIC80 of OFLX was 0.39 microgram/ml. Gentamicin (GM) and ST were slightly active against C. freundii. Among the cephems, CMX had the MIC80 of 25 micrograms/ml. 5. Enterobacter cloacae was less susceptible to the cephems tested. OFLX, GM, and mecillinam were active against this bacteria with MIC80s of 0.78, 0.78 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively. 6. Among the oral antibacterial and antibiotic agents and penicillins examined, piperacillin (PIPC) was the most active against Proteus mirabilis. Its MIC90 was 0.39 microgram/ml. Those of sulbenicillin, cefaclor, ampicillin, OFLX, and ST were 0.78, 0.78, 1.56, 3.13 and 3.13 micrograms/ml, respectively. CMX was highly active against P. mirabilis with an MIC90 of less than or equal to 0.10 microgram/ml; LMOX followed with an MIC90 of 0.20 microgram/ml among the injectable antibiotics tested. CTM was also active against this bacterium; the MIC90 was 0.39 microgram/ml. 7. The antibacterial and antibiotic agents were generally only slightly active against Proteus vulgaris.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of FK482, a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  - FK482 is an oral aminothiazolyl hydroxyimino cephalosporin with a C-3 vinyl group. Its activity was compared with those of cephalexin, cefuroxime, cefixime, and amoxicillin-clavulanate. FK482 inhibited 90% of Staphylococcus aureus isolates at 1 micrograms/ml and 90% of Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates at less than or equal to 0.012 micrograms/ml, superior to cephalexin and cefuroxime and similar to cefixime. It did not inhibit oxacillin-resistant S. aureus. FK482 inhibited 90% of Enterococcus faecalis isolates at 8 micrograms/ml. Although 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella species, and Shigella species isolates were inhibited by less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, FK482 was less active than cefixime against Citrobacter, Enterobacter, Morganella, Serratia, and Providencia species, with MICs for many isolates of greater than 8 micrograms/ml. FK482 inhibited Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae at concentrations comparable to that of cefixime and superior to those of cephalexin and cfaclor. Bacteroides and Pseudomonas species were resistant. FK482 was not hydrolyzed by the TEM-1 and TEM-2 beta-lactamases but was hydrolyzed by TEM-3 and the Proteus vulgaris enzyme. It had a high affinity for chromosomal beta-lactamases.
TI  - Postantibiotic effects of imipenem, norfloxacin, and amikacin in vitro and in vivo.
AB  - The postantibiotic effects (PAEs) of imipenem and norfloxacin were tested against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus (Enterococcus) faecalis, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Amikacin was tested against the same bacteria except Streptococcus faecalis. For in vitro tests, a viable count-washing method was used, and for in vivo tests, the thread technique in normal mice was used. All three drugs produced PAEs of 1.1 to 3.8 h in vitro and 1.4 to 4.3 h in vivo against the pathogens tested. In vitro and in vivo results correlated well. The PAE had a significantly (P less than 0.01 to 0.001) longer duration in vivo than in vitro, but the PAE of imipenem on Staphylococcus aureus was longer in vitro. The PAE was not due to residual antibiotics at the site of infection, and no PAE was obtained if at any time the antibiotic concentration at the infection site reached the MIC for the pathogen tested. The results indicate that the presence of a PAE may enable antibiotics to be given more intermittently without a loss of efficacy and that the PAE can only be induced if the level of the antibiotic exceeds the MIC for the pathogen in question for at least several minutes.
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach for estimating effective administrative dose of cephalothin. Reevaluation of MIC break points in 4 category system of disc susceptibility test].
AB  - The reliability of the cephalothin (CET) disc susceptibility test in estimating approximate values of MICs was studied using various clinical isolates totaling 248 strains and using Showa discs (8 mm diameter containing 30 micrograms of CET) and Difco discs (6 mm diameter containing 30 micrograms of CET). Clinical significance of a 4 category system for the interpretation of the CET disc tests, which is widely used in Japan, was reevaluated to determine whether this system would be suitable or not for the evaluation of proper dose levels of administration. The results obtained with the disc methods were compared with MICs determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) CFU/ml. The results of the CET disc susceptibility test were well correlated with MICs, showing the reliability of the disc method to estimate approximate values of MICs. Break points in MIC values proposed for the classification of bacteria into 4 categories of susceptibility are ( ) MIC less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, (++) MIC greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, (+) MIC greater than 15-60 micrograms/ml, (-) MIC greater than 60 micrograms/ml. With the Showa disc susceptibility test, 15 out of the 248 strains (6.0%) tested showed false positive results and 6 strains (2.4%) showed false negative results. With the Difco disc test, 18 out of the 248 strains (7.3%) tested showed false positive results and 6 (2.4%) showed false negative results. Excluding Enterococcus faecalis from the test, results because better in the quantitative estimation of MICs, resulting false positive rates of 3.2% (Showa), and 4.4% (Difco). A 3 category system of the interpretation of disc test is generally used in the USA and Europe. MIC break points proposed for the classification of the CET test are sensitive, MIC less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml, and resistance, MIC greater than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml. With the Showa disc susceptibility test, 14 out of the 248 strains (5.6%) tested showed false positive results and 6 strains (2.4%) showed false negative results. With the Difco disc test 7 out of the 248 strains (2.8%) showed false positive results and 21 strains (8.5%) showed false negative results. In this study, MIC70S of CET against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis were 1.56 and 0.78 micrograms/ml, respectively. CET was not so effective against Gram-negative rods except Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli. MIC70S against K. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis, and E. coli were 6.25, 3.13, and 3.13 micrograms/ml, respectively.
TI  - Development of a meropenem susceptibility disc: drug content, preliminary interpretive and quality control criteria and potency bioassay.
AB  - Laboratory studies were conducted to develop an appropriate susceptibility disc for meropenem. Laboratory-prepared paper discs containing 5, 10, and 20 micrograms of meropenem were investigated. Agar dilution MICs and agar disc diffusion tests were performed with 367 rapidly growing clinical isolates by methods recommended by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS). Agar disc diffusion tests with 10 micrograms meropenem discs acceptably defined organisms as susceptible or resistant. The preliminary interpretive zone size criteria for 10 micrograms meropenem discs were: susceptible, greater than or equal to 14 mm, and resistant, less than or equal to 10 mm, by application of the NCCLS imipenem MIC interpretive susceptible and resistant breakpoints to the meropenem data. A total of 270 agar disc diffusion assays were performed with each of four ATCC reference strains, using prototype discs (Becton Dickinson (BBL] containing 10 micrograms meropenem. The preliminary quality control limits for agar disc diffusion tests with these discs are: Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, 28-32 mm; Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, 26-31 mm; Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, 33-39 mm; and Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, 19-23 mm. Further studies are necessary to re-evaluate both the preliminary interpretive and quality control criteria before definitive limits can be established. A reproducible, large plate bioassay with Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212 was developed to monitor meropenem disc potency.
TI  - Growth of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria in platelet concentrates.
AB  - In 1986 the allowable platelet storage time was reduced from 7 to 5 days because  of a recent increase in septic deaths associated with platelet transfusion. In this study, the growth curves of two gram-positive and two gram-negative organisms in platelets stored for 7 days in CLX and PL-732 bags were evaluated. Platelets in CLX bags were inoculated with 10(1), 10(2), and 10(3) organisms and 10(2) organisms were introduced into PL-732 bags. Test organisms were inoculated into trypticase soy broth as a control. All four bacteria grew rapidly in trypticase soy broth, reaching 10(9) organisms per mL within 48 hours. In both CLX and PL-732 bags, the growth pattern of gram-positive organisms was generally logarithmic during the first few days of storage. A concentration of 10(8) organisms per mL was present by Day 3 or 4, after which further proliferation was inhibited by the high density of bacteria in the platelets. In PL-732 bags, the proliferation of gram-negative organisms followed a pattern similar to that of the gram-positive bacteria. However, gram-negative organisms grew less well in CLX bags.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [The influence of cefteram pivoxil on the intestinal bacterial flora].
AB  - The influence of cefteram pivoxil (CFTM-PI), a new oral cephalosporin, on the intestinal bacterial flora was studied in tetra-contaminated mice and in pediatric patients. CFTM-PI in fine granular form was administered at a dose of 10 mg/kg once a day for 5 consecutive days to mice contaminated with 4 different species of organisms: Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacteroides fragilis and Bifidobacterium breve. No remarkable change was observed in the fecal viable cell count except that slight decrease in E. coli count was observed on days 2 to 5 after starting administration. The subjects in pediatric study were 5 children, 3 boys and 2 girls at ages from 6 months to 10 years 4 months, with infections. Their body weights ranged from 3.5 to 28.0 kg. CFTM-PI in fine granular form was administered at each dose of 3.0 to 3.8 mg/kg, 3 times daily for 5 to 11 days. During the administration of CFTM-PI, there were some variations in the change of the fecal bacterial flora noticed between subjects. Although Enterobacteriaceae tended to decrease and Enterococci tended to increase, other main aerobes and anaerobes were almost unchanged in most cases. There was no case in which glucose non-fermenting Gram-negative rods and fungi became predominant. In a 10 years 4 months old boy, the fecal concentration of CFTM, the active form of CFTM-PI, was 72.20 micrograms/g and a remarkable decrease of total anaerobe count was observed. In feces, CFTM-PI and CFTM were detected in 4 and 2 cases respectively, and their concentrations were 1.50 approximately 89.65 micrograms/g and 2.25 approximately 72.20 micrograms/g, respectively. beta-Lactamase activities in feces were positive in all cases. From the above, CFTM-PI is considered to be a drug with relatively less influence on the intestinal bacterial flora. But as high concentrations of drugs were detected in feces under some circumstances, we need to pay attention to fecal drug concentrations.
TI  - Occurrence of drug-resistant bacteria in communal well water around Port Harcourt, Nigeria.
AB  - A total of 108 raw water samples was collected from 36 wells at nine shanty settlements around Port Harcourt, Nigeria, over a period of 7 months. Samples were analysed for their bacteriological quality. Selected bacterial strains isolated from the samples were tested for their susceptibility to ten commonly used antibiotics. The organisms isolated include Pseudomonas spp., Klebsiella spp., Staphylococcus spp., Proteus spp., Enterococcus faecalis, Aeromonas spp., Escherichia coli, Chromobacterium spp., Flavobacterium spp., and Serratia spp. Out of 300 strains tested, 23 (6.9%) were susceptible to all the antibiotics, 277 (92.3%) were resistant to at least one antibiotic and 232 (77.3%) were resistant to two or more antibiotics. The epidemiological significance of these results is discussed.
TI  - In vitro activity of CP-65,207, a new penem antimicrobial agent, in comparison with those of other agents.
AB  - CP-65,207 is a new parenteral penem antibiotic with a broad spectrum that includes gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic microorganisms, with MICs for 90% (MIC90s) of the majority of 1,101 clinical pathogens tested being less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml. The compound was from 10- to 100-fold more active than cefoxitin and broad-spectrum cephalosporins against gram-positive bacteria and anaerobes. CP-65,207 was less active than imipenem for staphylococci, group A streptococci, and Enterococcus faecalis. Against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, CP-65,207 was in general 100-fold more active than cefoxitin, 5- to 10-fold more active than broad-spectrum cephalosporins, and 2-fold more active than imipenem. Fresh clinical isolates that were resistant to broad-spectrum cephalosporins were highly susceptible to CP-65,207 and imipenem (MIC90, 1 microgram/ml). Isolates of Enterococcus faecalis, Serratia marcescens, and anaerobic Peptococcus spp. had MIC90s of 8, 2, and 3.12 micrograms/ml, respectively. CP-65,207 was not very active against methicillin-resistant staphylococci or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Killing kinetics showed that against some strains CP-65,207 is rapidly bactericidal at concentrations well below those required to achieve a similar degree of killing with cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and ceftriaxone. CP-65,207 was only slightly susceptible to hydrolysis by type I cephalosporinases and TEM-1, SHV-1, and PSE-2 plasmid-encoded enzymes. It had the highest affinity for penicillin-binding proteins 2, 1A, 1B, and 3 in cell-free preparations of Escherichia coli W-7.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo activities of QA-241, a new tricyclic quinolone derivative.
AB  - The in vitro susceptibilities of 1,310 clinical isolates to QA-241, a novel tricyclic quinolone, were evaluated in comparison with susceptibilities to norfloxacin, ofloxacin, enoxacin, and ciprofloxacin. The MICs of QA-241 for 90% of staphylococci, Enterococcus faecalis isolates, and streptococcal species ranged from 1.56 to 6.25 micrograms/ml, and the activity of QA-241 was similar to those of norfloxacin and enoxacin but two to four times less potent than those of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. At the concentration of less than or equal to 1.56 micrograms/ml, QA-241 inhibited 90% of Haemophilus influenzae, Bordetella pertussis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and gram-negative enteric bacteria except for Serratia marcescens and Citrobacter freundii. QA-241 was moderately active (MIC for 90% of strains tested, 6.25 to 12.5 micrograms/ml) against S. marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Xanthomonas maltophilia, and Bacteroides fragilis. The antibacterial activity of QA-241 was roughly comparable to that of enoxacin but two to four times less potent than that of ofloxacin. In systemic infections in mice with gram-positive cocci and gram-negative rods, the efficacy of QA-241 was generally greater than that of norfloxacin and similar to those of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. In urinary tract infections in mice with Escherichia coli or Pseudomonas aeruginosa, QA-241 was as active as ofloxacin and more active than norfloxacin but less active than ciprofloxacin. In pulmonary infections in mice with Klebsiella pneumoniae, the effectiveness of QA-241 was similar to that of ofloxacin.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activities of piperacillin-tazobactam and ticarcillin-clavulanate.
AB  - The in vitro activities of ticarcillin, piperacillin, clavulanic acid, tazobactam, ticarcillin-clavulanate, and piperacillin-tazobactam against 819 bacterial isolates were compared. The two beta-lactamase inhibitors, clavulanic acid and tazobactam, had little useful antibacterial activity but enhanced the activities of the penicillins against beta-lactamase-producing strains of Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis, and methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus; all strains were susceptible to both combinations. Both enzyme inhibitors also enhanced the activities of the penicillins against most strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Citrobacter diversus, Proteus spp., Providencia spp., and Bacteroides spp. and against occasional strains of Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter spp., and Serratia marcescens. Clavulanic acid frequently enhanced the activity of ticarcillin against Xanthomonas maltophilia, and tazobactam frequently enhanced the activity of piperacillin against Morganella morganii. Enhancement was observed primarily with strains relatively resistant to the penicillins. In general, clavulanic acid was more effective than tazobactam in enhancing penicillin activity against Klebsiella spp., C. diversus, X. maltophilia, and Bacteroides spp., whereas tazobactam was more effective against Escherichia coli and Proteeae. There was little or no enhancement of activity against Enterococcus faecalis, Aeromonas hydrophila, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas cepacia, or Acinetobacter anitratus. Clavulanic acid occasionally antagonized the activity of ticarcillin against ticarcillin-susceptible members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, but those strains were still considered susceptible to the combination. Tazobactam never antagonized the activity of piperacillin. In a direct comparison of the activities of ticarcillin-clavulanate and piperacillin-tazobactam, the two were equally active against H. influenzae, B. catarrhalis, and S. aureus; the latter was more active against E. faecalis. For relatively susceptible strains of members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, neither combination was predictably more active than the other, but relatively resistant strains were generally more susceptible to piperacillin-tazobactam. Piperacillin-tazobactam was more active than ticarcillin-clavulanate against A. hydrophila, P. aeruginosa, and P. cepacia, similar in activity against A. anitratus, and less active against X. maltophilia and Bacteroides spp.
TI  - Enhancement of survival from murine polymicrobial peritonitis with increased abdominal abscess formation.
AB  - Muramyl dipeptide (MDP), a purified synthetic immune adjuvant, has been shown to  increase murine intraabdominal abscess formation in a monomicrobial model using Bacteroides fragilis. This effect required live bacteria and was abolished by appropriate antibiotics. A polymicrobial model of peritonitis and abdominal abscess formation using Streptococcus fecalis, Escherichia coli, and B. fragilis was initially used to determine mortality rates at various concentrations and obtain an appropriate LD50. Animals were then pretreated with MDP or its inert buffer and underwent intraperitoneal injection of the appropriate bacterial suspension. Mortality and abdominal abscess formation were then assessed at 2 weeks after injection. There was a significant reduction in mortality (P less than 0.03) in mice treated with MDP compared to the controls. In surviving animals, there was also a significant increase in the number of animals forming abscesses (P less than 0.05) following treatment with MDP. This study has shown that nonspecific immune stimulation by MDP provided enhanced protection against a polymicrobial intraperitoneal challenge and paradoxically increased the formation of abdominal abscesses at the same time. This may be regarded as enhancement of the natural history of survival from peritonitis via bacterial containment through intraabdominal abscess formation, a manifestation of beneficial outcome in experimental peritonitis.
TI  - Antibacterials. Synthesis and structure-activity studies of 3-aryl-2-oxooxazolidines. 1. The "B" group.
AB  - The synthesis and structure/activity studies of the effect of varying the "B" group in a series of oxazolidinone antibacterials (I) are described. Two synthetic routes were used: (1) alkylation of aniline with glycidol followed by dialkyl carbonate heterocyclization to afford I (A = H, B = OH), whose arene ring was further elaborated by using electrophilic aromatic substitution methodology; (2) cycloaddition of substituted aryl isocyanates with epoxides to give A and B with a variety of values. I with B = OH or Br were converted to other "B" functionalities by using SN2 methodology. Antibacterial evaluation of compounds I with A = acetyl, isopropyl, methylthio, methylsulfinyl, methylsulfonyl, and sulfonamido and a variety of different "B" groups against Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis concluded that the compounds with B = aminoacyl, and particularly acetamido, were the most active of those examined in each A series, possessing MICs in the range of 0.5-4 micrograms/mL for the most active compounds described.
TI  - The non-flavin redox center of the streptococcal NADH peroxidase. I. Thiol reactivity and redox behavior in the presence of urea.
AB  - Unlike the 2-electron-reduced (EH2) forms of the flavoprotein disulfide reductases and mercuric reductase, the native EH2 form of the streptococcal NADH peroxidase is quite refractile toward chemical modification with thiol-specific reagents. In the presence of 1.3 M urea, however, the single thiol of the reduced enzyme reacts with phenylmercuric acetate with a t1/2 of 3 min. This modification abolishes the charge-transfer absorbance band at 540 nm and inactivates the enzyme; the latter effect is shown to be reversed with dithiothreitol. Alkylation of the streptococcal peroxidase with iodo[1-14C]acetamide under reducing conditions in the presence of 8 M guanidine hydrochloride allows the isolation of a single labeled tryptic peptide with the sequence: Gly-Asp-Phe-Ile-Ser-Phe-Leu-Ser-C*ys-Gly-Met-Gln-Leu-Tyr-Leu- Glu-Gly-Lys. This sequence is identical to that previously reported (Poole, L. B., and Claiborne, A. (1988) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 153, 261-266) for the cysteinyl peptide isolated from the NADH peroxidase labeled metabolically with [35S]cysteine. Careful examination of the physical properties of the streptococcal peroxidase in the presence of 1.3 M urea shows that, while catalytic activity and native structural features are largely retained, the relative potentials of flavin and non-flavin redox centers are dramatically affected. We propose that low concentrations of urea stabilize an intermediate state in the transition between native and denatured forms, which is responsible for the observed changes in both active-site thiol reactivity and in redox properties.
TI  - Purification and characterization of human neutrophil peptide 4, a novel member of the defensin family.
AB  - Primary (azurophil) granules of neutrophils contain proteins which play a major role in the killing and digestion of bacteria in the phagolysosome. We have isolated and characterized a novel antimicrobial peptide from the azurophil granule fraction of discontinuous Percoll gradients. We have named this peptide human neutrophil peptide 4 (HNP-4) based on its structural similarity to a group of antimicrobial polypeptides known as defensins (HNP 1-3). Using size exclusion and reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography, HNP-4 was purified to homogeneity as judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and amino-terminal sequence analysis. The amino acid sequence determined from isolated HNP-4 and from tryptic fragments of reduced and alkylated peptide is: NH2-Val-Cys-Ser-Cys-Arg-Leu-Val-Phe-Cys-Arg-Arg-Thr-Glu- Leu-Arg-Val-Gly-Asn-Cys-Leu-Ile-Gly-Gly-Val-Ser-Phe-Thr-Tyr-Cys-Cys-Thr- Arg-Val - COOH. Based on this sequence, HNP-4 has a calculated molecular weight of 3715 and a theoretical pI of 8.61. HNP-4 shows structural similarity to the family of three human defensins. HNP-4 and the defensins have identical cysteine backbones and, like the defensins, HNP-4 is rich in arginine (15.2 mol %). However, the amino acids at 22 of the 33 positions differ between HNP-4 and human defensins. Further, HNP-4 is significantly more hydrophobic than the defensins, as determined by its retention time on reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. In vitro, purified HNP-4 was shown to kill Escherichia coli, Streptococcus faecalis, and Candida albicans. Compared to a mixture of the other human defensins, HNP-4 was found to be approximately 100 times more potent against E. coli and four times more potent against both S. faecalis and C. albicans.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of piperacillin and gentamicin using a dynamic system simulating in vivo pharmacokinetics.
AB  
TI  - Sulbactam/ampicillin versus metronidazole/gentamicin in the treatment of post-cesarean section endometritis.
AB  - Sixty-seven patients diagnosed with post-cesarean-section endometritis were studied in a prospective comparative randomized trial of sulbactam/ampicillin, a new beta-lactamase inhibitor drug combination, versus treatment with metronidazole/gentamicin. The success rate was 91% for each antibiotic regimen. Mycoplasma spp. or Ureaplasma spp. were isolated from all treatment failures. Endometrial cultures revealed 2.3 aerobes as well as anaerobes per patient, with Enterococcus faecalis, Bacteroides bivius, and Escherichia coli the most frequently reported bacterial isolates in 64, 40, and 28% of all patients, respectively. Positive blood cultures were noted in 11 (15%) patients with Mycoplasma sp. the most commonly found isolate (45.5%). Sulbactam/ampicillin appears to be safe and equally effective as a metronidazole/aminoglycoside drug regimen in the treatment of postpartum endometritis.
TI  - [The influence of cefpodoxime proxetil on the intestinal bacterial flora].
AB  - The influence of cefpodoxime proxetil (CPDX-PR, CS-807), a new oral cephalosporin, on the intestinal bacterial flora was studied in tetra-contaminated mice and in pediatric patients. CPDX-PR dry syrup was administered at a dose of 10 mg/kg once a day for 5 consecutive days to mice contaminated with 4 different species of bacteria: Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacteroides fragilis and Bifidobacterium breve. No notable changes were observed in fecal viable cell counts except that slight decreases of E. coli counts were observed on the days 3 to 5 after starting administration. The subjects in the pediatric study were 5 children with infections, 3 boys and 2 girls at ages from 1 year 1 month to 6 years 10 months, with their body weights ranging from 9.3 to 23.8 kg. CPDX-PR dry syrup was administered at a dose between 3.0 to 3.7 mg/kg, 3 times a day for 4 to 7 days. Although some variations of the fecal bacterial flora were noticed between subjects during the administration of CPDX-PR, no notable changes were observed in major aerobic and anaerobic bacteria such as Enterobacteriaceae, Enterococcus, Bacteroides and Bifidobacterium in 4 of the 5 cases. Large decreases in Streptococcus, Enterobacteriaceae, Bifidobacterium, Eubacterium and anaerobic cocci and an increase in Enterococcus were observed in the other case. There was no case in which glucose non-fermenting Gram-negative rods and fungi became predominant. Regarding Enterobacteriaceae, transitory bacterial replacement was observed within the genus. Fecal concentration of CPDX during the administration of CPDX-PR was extremely low or below the detectable limit except one specimen from a case in which intestinal bacterial flora showed remarkable changes. From the above, CPDX-PR appears to be a drug with a relatively small influence on the intestinal bacterial flora.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of a new quinolone, AM-1091.
AB  - The in vitro activity of a new quinolone, AM-1091 [7-(3-amino-1-pyrrolidinyl)-8-chloro-1-cyclopropyl-6-fluoro-1,4-dihydro- 4-oxo- 3-quinoline carboxylic acid hydrochloride], was compared with those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, beta-lactams, and gentamicin. AM-1091 inhibited 90% of the isolates of the family Enterobacteriaceae at less than or equal to 0.12 micrograms/ml. For many species AM-1091 was 2-fold more active than ciprofloxacin and 2- to 32-fold more active than ofloxacin. It inhibited Enterobacter, Citrobacter, and Klebsiella species resistant to ceftazidime and gentamicin. Ninety percent of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were inhibited by 0.5 micrograms/ml, so for this species AM-1091 was twofold less active than ciprofloxacin. AM-1091 was more active against Pseudomonas cepacia and Xanthomonas maltophilia, inhibiting isolates resistant to imipenem and gentamicin. Most Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Branhamella catarrhalis isolates were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml. The MICs for 90% of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Enterococcus faecalis isolates were 0.06, 0.06, and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. AM-1091 inhibited hemolytic streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae at 0.25 micrograms/ml and was more active than ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin against gram-positive species. AM-1091 inhibited 90% of the Bacteroides species at 0.5 micrograms/ml. The frequency of spontaneous resistance was less than 10(-10) for most organisms, but resistant strains could be selected by repeated subculturing. Although AM-1091 had lower in vitro activity at pH 5.5 and in the presence of high concentrations of Mg2+, it still inhibited most organisms at </= 0.5 micrograms/ml under these conditions. AM-1091 rapidly killed Escherichia coli and P. aeruginosa and had a prolonged postantibiotic suppressive effect on these bacteria.
TI  - [Clinical studies on cefpodoxime proxetil dry syrup in the field of pediatrics].
AB  - Cefpodoxime proxetil (CPDX-PR, CS-807) dry syrup was administered orally to 31 patients with various infections at daily dose levels between 5.4 and 10.9 mg/kg divided into three doses. 1. The subjects were 3 patients with urinary tract infections, 25 with tonsillitis and 1 patient each with bronchitis, pneumonia, and cervical lymphadenitis. Clinical effects were excellent in 16 cases, good in 14, and fair in 1 (tonsillitis), with an overall efficacy rate of 96.8%. 2. Organisms suspected as pathogens were 32 strains (6 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 2 of Streptococcus pyogenes, 1 of Enterococcus faecalis, 15 of Haemophilus influenzae, 5 of Haemophilus parainfluenzae and 3 of Escherichia coli). Bacteriologically, eradication of pathogens were observed in 30 strains, decrease in one (H. parainfluenzae), and no change in another (E. faecalis), thus the eradication rate was 93.8%. 3. Side effect was observed in 1 case (slight eruption) but it was possible continue the treatment. Abnormal laboratory test values were observed in 1 case of a slight prolongation of prothrombin time and eosinophilia, but they were not serious. Diarrhea was not observed in any patients. 4. All the medication was done on schedule. No refusal of the drug occurred due to its taste or odor.
TI  - [Bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies on cefpodoxime proxetil in the pediatric field].
AB  - Bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies on cefpodoxime proxetil (CPDX-PR, CS-807), a new oral cephem antibiotic, were carried out in the field of pediatrics. The results obtained are summarized as follows. 1. Antibacterial activities of R-3746 (Na-salt of cefpodoxime (CPDX] against clinically isolated strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Branhamella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Haemophilus influenzae were compared with those of cefaclor, cephalexin and cefadroxil. R-3746 is superior to other antibiotics against S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, B. catarrhalis and Gram-negative rods. 2. Serum concentrations of CPDX after administration of CPDX-PR at doses of 3 mg/kg (fasting), 6 mg/kg (non-fasting) and 6 mg/kg (fasting) were determined. Mean AUC (area under curve)'s of CPDX obtained were 9.60, 31.35 and 17.89 micrograms.hr/ml, respectively for the 3 dosages. The mean half-lives of CPDX were 3.35, 1.88 and 1.76 hours, respectively. The mean urinary recovery rate within 8 hours after administration of CPDX-PR at a dose of 3 mg/kg (fasting) was 39.2%. 3. CPDX-PR was administered to 37 pediatric patients with various bacterial infections (pyelonephritis 9, cystitis 4, pneumonia 7, acute bronchitis 3, otitis media 2, tonsillitis 10, subcutaneous abscess 1 and purulent lymphadenitis 1). The overall clinical efficacy rate was 91.9% and the overall bacteriological eradication rate was also 91.9%. 4. No adverse reactions were observed. Abnormal laboratory findings were moderate, eosinophilia in 2 and slight elevation of GOT and GPT in 1. The taste and the odor of the CPDX-PR preparation was sufficiently tolerable. From the above results we have concluded that CPDX-PR is a useful oral antibiotic in the treatment of bacterial infections in children.
TI  - Bacteria and gallstone nucleation.
AB  - This preliminary study reports for the first time that there might be a possible  association between bacteria and the aetiology of some cholesterol calculi. The gall-bladder biles from 225 cholecystectomy patients underwent bacteriological and microscopic study. Cholesterol calculi from 13 patients (10.2%) were observed to be associated with gall-bladder bile profusely infected with at least one bacterial species that was shown to possess beta-glucuronidase activity, an enzyme that is thought to promote calcium bilirubinate precipitation in bile. Concomitantly, the associated gall-bladder bile was 'high' in calcium bilirubinate precipitation and the precipitate was also detected in the centre of the gallstones. Moreover, in approximately half of these patients (six of 13), the cholesterol gallstones' nuclear areas also contained calcium palmitate, which is also thought to be due to bacterial activity. The results also support the hypothesis that bacteria with active beta-glucuronidase (for example, Escherichia coli) can significantly influence the aetiology of brown pigment gallstones. In contrast, bacteria were observed to have no role in black pigment gallstone formation, as their associated gall-bladder biles were always observed to be sterile.
TI  - Pathogenicity of enterococci in a rat model of fecal peritonitis.
AB  - The pathogenicity of enterococci in intraabdominal sepsis has not been clarified. Therefore, fecal-type peritonitis was induced in rats by intraperitoneal injection of barium sulfate along with a bacterial inoculum consisting of Escherichia coli, Bacteroides fragilis, and Clostridium perfringens with or without Streptococcus faecalis. Mortality at 19 d and characteristics of intraabdominal abscesses in survivors at 19 d were analyzed. The presence of S. faecalis in the original inoculum was significantly associated with death or large (greater than 20 mm) abscess formation when these two end points were examined together. S. faecalis may synergize with other bacteria in intraabdominal sepsis to augment morbidity and possibly mortality.
TI  - Antibiotic proteins of human polymorphonuclear leukocytes.
AB  - Nine polypeptide peaks with antibiotic activity were resolved from human polymorphonuclear leukocyte azurophil granule membranes. All but 1 of the 12 constituent polypeptides were identified by N-terminal sequence analysis. Near quantitative recovery of protein and activity permitted an assessment of the contribution of each species to the overall respiratory-burst-independent antimicrobial capacity of the cell. Three uncharacterized polypeptides were discovered, including two broad-spectrum antibiotics. One of these, a defensin that we have designated human neutrophil antimicrobial peptide 4, was more potent than previously described defensins but represented less than 1% of the total protein. The other, named azurocidin, was abundant and comparable to bactericidal permeability-increasing factor in its contribution to the killing of Escherichia coli.
TI  - Monoadduct forming photochemical reagents for labeling nucleic acids for hybridization.
AB  - We describe the synthesis of three angelicin derivatives which can be used for labeling nucleic acids with biotin. These compounds were used to label nucleic acids in the presence of lysed cell constituents. The resulting labelled nucleic acids show hybridization to a genus specific probe for E. coli. The relative comparison of sensitivity indicates that a polyamine linker is better than a polyethylene oxide linker between the biotin and angelicin moieties.
TI  - Quality control parameters and interpretive criteria for in vitro susceptibility  tests with the macrolide azithromycin. Collaborative Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing Group.
AB  - Quality control parameters for broth microdilution and disk diffusion susceptibility tests were defined and the interpretive criteria for disk diffusion tests reviewed. For interpretation of tests with 15 micrograms azithromycin disks, the following criteria are recommended: greater than or equal to 19 mm for the susceptible category (MIC less than or equal to 2.0 micrograms/ml) and less than or equal to 15 mm for the resistant category (MIC greater than or equal to 8.0 micrograms/ml). Using these criteria, there was 97% overall agreement between broth dilution and disk diffusion tests; Haemophilus influenzae isolates were susceptible to azithromycin by both methods. The quality control strain Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 gave zones of 21 to 26 mm in diameter in a six-laboratory collaborative study. In azithromycin broth microdilution tests the following MIC control limits are recommended: Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, 2.0-8.0 micrograms/ml; Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213, 0.25-1.0 micrograms/ml; and Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, 1.0-4.0 micrograms/ml.
TI  - Bacteriological study of choledochal bile in patients with common bile duct stones, with or without acute suppurative cholangitis.
AB  - Acute suppurative cholangitis is a serious complication in extrahepatic biliary tract obstruction. Bacteriological studies have shown that in these patients the bile cultures usually present several kinds of bacteria, especially Gram-negative aerobic bacteria such as E. coli and Klebsiella sp. The mortality rate in our patients with common bile duct stones and acute suppurative cholangitis is enhanced 5- to 10-fold. The aim of the present study was to analyse the bacterial properties of choledochal bile in a large number of patients with common bile duct stones, with or without acute suppurative cholangitis, and to determine the sensitivity of the isolated bacteria to several antibiotics used in clinical practice. The greatest sensitivity of the bacteria isolated from the common bile duct was seen for aminoglycosides (gentamicin and amikacin) and for cephalosporins, especially of the third generation (cefotaxime, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone and cefoperazone). Ampicillin showed a low sensitivity rate. The appropriate selection of the antibiotics used in acute suppurative cholangitis depends not only on the concentration of the antibiotic in the bile; a high plasma concentration is even more important to control the septic manifestations. A high excretion to the bile can affect the intestinal flora, leading to diarrhea (e. g. with cefoperazone). Ampicillin has been giving contradictory results in respect of bile and plasma concentrations. Gentamicin attains 30-40% of the plasma concentration in the bile, but persists for as long as 8 hours with excellent sensitivity and clinical efficacy. Amikacin reaches 44% of the plasma concentration with a very high sensitivity (96%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Synthesis of novel 5-fluoro analogues of norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin.
AB  - A series of polyfluoro-3-quinolonecarboxylic acids have been synthesized and their in vitro antibacterial activity evaluated. The desired 7-(substituted amino) derivatives were prepared from the 5,6,7,8-tetrafluoroquinolone acids. Conversely, amine displacement occurred primarily at the 5-position when the ester was used. Structure-activity studies indicated that the antibacterial activity was greatest when the N-1 substituent was cyclopropyl and the 7-substituent was 4-methyl-1-piperazinyl. All 5-(substituted amino) derivatives showed poor in vitro activity.
TI  - In vitro activity of lomefloxacin (NY-198 or SC 47111).
AB  - The activity of lomefloxacin was compared to that of four other quinolones. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were similar to those of enoxacin, norfloxacin, and ofloxacin against the Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus spp. and Enterococcus faecalis. The activity of lomefloxacin was antagonized in urine at pH 5.4, but not in urine at pH 7.0. Higher inocula required higher lomefloxacin concentrations for inhibition. Lomefloxacin was more active at alkaline pH. At concentrations equal to or 2-fold the MIC, it was rapidly bactericidal against Gram-negative organisms and required a longer time for the reduction of inoculum by 99% and 99.9%. An "Eagle effect" was seen against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus but not against P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of lomefloxacin, a difluoro-quinolone.
AB  - Lomefloxacin is a new difluoro-quinolone. In this study, we have determined the in vitro activity of lomefloxacin against a wide range of clinical bacterial isolates and compared it with that of other fluoro-quinolones and some unrelated antimicrobials. Lomefloxacin was very active against Enterobacteriaceae (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) with activity comparable to that of ofloxacin (MIC90, 0.25 micrograms/ml). Lomefloxacin was moderately active against isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90, 4 micrograms/ml), and again the activity was comparable to ofloxacin (MIC90, 4 micrograms/ml) but was eightfold less than ciprofloxacin (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml). Lomefloxacin was also active against isolates of Staphylococcus aureus (MIC90, 1 micrograms/ml), irrespective of methicillin susceptibility, and this activity was most comparable to ofloxacin (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) and ciprofloxacin (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml). Lomefloxacin was fourfold less active than either ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin against isolates of Enterococcus faecalis (MIC90, 8 micrograms/ml) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC90, 8 micrograms/ml). In common with ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, lomefloxacin was very active against isolates of Neisseria spp. (MIC90, less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), Haemophilus spp. (MIC90, less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), Legionella spp. (MIC90, less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), Vibrio spp. (MIC90, less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), and Campylobacter jejuni (MIC90, 1 microgram/ml). Lomefloxacin showed poor activity against isolates of Bacteroides spp. (MIC90, 16 micrograms/ml) or Clostridium difficile MIC90, 32 micrograms/ml) and was only moderately active against isolates of Clostridium perfringens (MIC90, 2 micrograms/ml), Peptostreptococcus spp. (MIC90, 4 micrograms/ml), Chlamydia trachomatis (MIC90, 4 micrograms/ml), Mycoplasma hominis (MIC90, 2 micrograms/ml), and Urea-plasma urealyticum (MIC90, 8 micrograms/ml). Lomefloxacin was found to be bactericidal at concentrations generally close to the MIC with greater than 3 log10 reduction in viability of exponentially dividing cultures of Escherichia coli and S. aureus within 5 hr of exposure to concentrations at eight times the MIC. These results indicate a potential clinical role for lomefloxacin in the treatment of genitourinary tract infections caused by Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, respiratory tract infections caused by susceptible organisms, and soft tissue infections caused by S. aureus.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of lomefloxacin SC 47111 (NY-198) and ciprofloxacin against selected pathogens.
AB  - The bacterial activity of lomefloxacin and ciprofloxacin against selected pathogens was compared using kill-kinetic methods to assess inhibitory (1 x MIC) and suprainhibitory (4 x MIC) concentrations. Five strains each of the following microorganisms were studied: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We found that lomefloxacin was 8- to 16-fold less active than ciprofloxacin as measured by MICs. However, the bactericidal activities of both lomefloxacin and ciprofloxacin were comparable when concentrations 1 x MIC and 4 x MIC were tested. For many of the isolates tested, such concentrations would be achieved clinically. The low MICs seen for the Gram-negative bacilli did not correlate with killing ability for either drug: concentrations 8-16 x MIC were needed for 99.9% killing of the final inoculum. Although higher concentrations of lomefloxacin are needed for inhibitory and bactericidal activity, the improved pharmacokinetics of lomefloxacin may result in this agent being comparable to ciprofloxacin.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies on imipenem/cilastatin sodium in neonates].
AB  - Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies on imipenem/cilastatin sodium (IPM/CS) were performed in neonates. The results obtained are summarized as follows. 1. Plasma levels and urinary excretion of IPM and CS sodium were determined in 7 neonates with ages between 7 and 26 days (gestation periods were 37 to 41 weeks and birth weights were 2,410 to 3,890 g) upon 1 hour drip intravenous infusion of IPM/CS at 10 mg/10 mg/kg, or 20 mg/20 mg/kg. Mean plasma concentrations of IPM reached their peaks at the end of infusion with levels of 12.7 +/- 3.0 micrograms/ml for the group given 10 mg/10 mg/kg, and 19.1 +/- 4.1 micrograms/ml for 20 mg/20 mg/kg. The concentration of IPM in plasma showed a dose-response to the 10 mg/10 mg/kg and 20 mg/20 mg/kg dosages. Concentrations decreased with half-lives of 1.87 +/- 0.71 hours and 1.97 +/- 0.21 hours for the low and the high dosages, and plasma levels at 8 hours after administration were 0.3 +/- 0.1 microgram/ml and 0.8 +/- 0.3 microgram/ml, respectively. Mean urinary recovery rates in 8 hours after administration were 37.6 +/- 11.8% and 26.8 +/- 17.2% for the low and the high dosages. While, mean plasma concentrations and mean urinary recovery rates of CS were higher than those of IPM, mean plasma half-lives of CS were similar to IPM. 2. IPM/CS was administered to 11 neonatal patients (with ages between 1 and 26 days) of various bacterial infections, and clinical effectiveness, bacteriological efficacy and adverse reactions were evaluated. Clinical efficacies in cases including 7 with acute pneumonia and 1 each with suspected septicemia, intrauterine infection, acute urinary tract infection and periproctal abscess were judged excellent in 10 and good in 1 case, and the efficacy rate was 100%. Causative organisms isolated from these patients included 3 strains of Escherichia coli and 1 strain each of Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae Enterococcus faecalis and Haemophilus influenzae. All the organisms were eradicated by IPM/CS, thus the bacteriological eradication rate was 100%. No adverse reactions were observed, but decreased platelet in 1 patient and increased GOT in 2 patients were found as abnormal laboratory test values. These changes, however were transient, and returned to normal after discontinuation of IPM/CS. It was concluded that the clinical results of IPM/CS are indicative of excellent efficacy, safety and usefulness of the drug in the treatment of infections in neonates.
TI  - Association experiments with aerobic and anaerobic pathogens: a model of in-vitro susceptibility testing in mixed infections. Activity of enoxacin, clindamycin, and metronidazole.
AB  - In infections of polymicrobial etiology, it seems mandatory to combine an antibiotic with marginal activity against anaerobes with an anti-anaerobic drug, e.g. metronidazole or clindamycin. We investigated the effect of associations of anaerobic and facultatively anaerobic pathogens on MBCs of enoxacin, clindamycin, metronidazole, and combinations of enoxacin plus clindamycin or metronidazole. Single testing, and associations of Bacteroides fragilis with Escherichia coli or Enterococcus faecalis revealed MBCs of 64 mg/l for enoxacin. However, investigating metronidazole, MBCs for B. fragilis increased from 0.5-1 mg/l to 2-4 mg/l in association with E. coli. The combination of enoxacin with metronidazole restored MBCs of 0.5 and 1 mg/l for the B. fragilis strains. B. fragilis associated with E. faecalis showed MBCs of 2 to 64 mg/l for metronidazole, an increase of up to 64-fold. The enoxacin MBCs for E. coli in association with B. fragilis were up to eight-fold higher than for E. coli alone (2 mg/l compared to 0.25 mg/l). Association of E. coli with E. faecalis and B. fragilis showed a low to moderate increase for MBCs of E. coli when enoxacin was tested alone or in combination with metronidazole or clindamycin. In contrast, MBCs for E. faecalis did not change significantly with any of the associations or combinations tested. It is evident that in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility of associations of pathogens can be modified by interactions between strains, and/or antimicrobials.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. A study mainly focused on ofloxacin (the second report). Reported by the Research Group for Testing ofloxacin Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - Susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (OFLX) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures throughout Japan between April, 1986 and March, 1987. The results were totalized with an emphasis mainly on OFLX and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. In this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. Similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to OFLX included Staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), Entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), Escherichia coli (4,097 strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), Enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), Enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), Citrobacter freundii (406 strains), Proteus mirabilis (613 strains), Morganella morganii (320 strains), Serratia marcescens (869 strains), Haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), Acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and Campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). Neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to OFLX was investigated with this species. As results, OFLX showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, E. aerogenes, C. freundii, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, H. influenzae, A. calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp., and C. jejuni. However, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. The following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: Streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), Streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), Enterococcus faecium (146 strains), Branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), Citrobacter diversus (128 strains), Klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), Proteus vulgaris (438 strains), Serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), Pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), Pseudomonas putida (154 strains), Xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), Vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), Bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of lomefloxacin in the urine during the 4 days following  a single 400 mg oral dose].
AB  - Antibacterial activity of lomefloxacin was studied in the urine after single dose of 400 mg in ten healthy female volunteers. Urine was collected in 7 periods: 0-3 h, 3-6 h, 6-12 h, 12-24 h, 24-48 h, 48-72 h, 72-96 h. Lomefloxacin concentration were assayed in all samples by microbiological method. Urine antibacterial activity was determined towards five strains isolated in urine: 2 E. Coli strains one sensitive and the other resistant to nalidixic acid (Nal-A), 1 Klebsiella pneumoniae resistant to nalidixic acid (Nal-B), 1 Staphylococcus saprophyticus and 1 Streptococcus faecalis. MIC's of lomefloxacin against these strains were respectively 0.06, 0.50, 0.50, 0.25 and 4 micrograms/ml. Lomefloxacin mean concentrations were 208.5 +/- 44.2, 104.3 +/- 15.2, 100.5 +/- 17.9, 36.8 +/- 8.2, 9.6 +/- 2.2 micrograms/ml in the five first urine samples. Low levels were present in urine the 4th day. Mean urine elimination percentage was 62.2 +/- 4.2% for the four days, with extreme values from 91.2 to 41.8%. Urine bacteriostatic activity against enterobacteriacae was greater than or equal to 32 the first day reaching 8,192 for the Nal-S E. Coli, it was greater than or equal to 4 the second day. Against staphylococcus it was greater than or equal to 64 the first day, greater than or equal to 16 the second day. Against enterococcus it was greater than or equal to 4 the first day. Against the strains implicated in UTI a bacteriostatic activity was present during 2 days in all subjects.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of pefloxacin in the urine during the 7 days following a  single 800 mg oral dose].
AB  - Antibacterial activity of pefloxacin was studied in the urine after a single 800  mg oral dose in ten healthy female volunteers. Urine was collected in 9 periods: 0-6 h, 6-12 h, 12-24 h, 24-28 h, 48-72 h, 72-96 h, 96-120 h, 120-144 h, 144-168 h. Pefloxacin concentrations were assayed in all samples by a microbiological method and by HPLC. Urine antibacterial activity was determined towards five bacterial strains isolated in urine: 2 E. Coli strains, one sensitive and the other resistant to nalidixic acid (Nal-A), 1 Klebsiella pneumoniae resistant to nalidixic acid (Nal-B), 1 Staphylococcus saprophyticus and 1 Streptococcus faecalis; MIC's of pefloxacin against these strains were respectively 0.015, 0.25, 1, 0.50 and 2 micrograms/ml. Pefloxacin mean concentrations as determined by the microbiological method were 91.8 +/- 11.9, 71.7 +/- 7, 44.5 +/- 4.3, 24.4 +/- 4 and 5.4 +/- 0.8 micrograms/ml in the five first urine samples; low levels were present in the urine until the 7th day in 8 volunteers. HPLC results completed the already known data concerning pefloxacin elimination and metabolism; unchanged pefloxacin was excreted at the highest concentration during the 6 first hours; then demethylpefloxacin was eliminated at higher levels than pefloxacin with a ratio of 2/1 after the 24th hour. These two compounds were detectable in the urine during 5 to 7 days; oxodemethylpefloxacin and N-oxyde-pefloxacin were present in lower amounts and during a shorter period.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [The effect of roxithromycin on the aerobic fecal flora in children].
AB  - To evaluate the effect of roxithromycin on aerobic flora in 14 children treated orally (5 mg/kg/day during 5 to 7 days) quantitative stool cultures were performed using selective media. Enterobacteriaceae (EB), streptococci D (STR D), Staphylococcus aureus, Candida were counted at days 0, 2 and 5 days, and 2 days after treatment. The MIC of each strain was determined for roxithromycin, erythromycin and spiramycin. Ten infants in a nursery had already received antibiotics. A moderate albeit significant (p less than 0.01) decrease was observed for EB, falling from 7.2 log 10 (range 5-9) to 4.9 (range 2-8) per gram of stools, rising to 5.8 after treatment. There was no significant effect for STR D. The MIC of roxithromycin for EB increased from 244 mg/l (range 0.03-512) to 340 (range 0.03-512). For STR. D, it increased from 138 (range 1-1024) to 427 (range 1-1024). The bacteria with low MIC (less than or equal to 64 mg/l for EB and less than or equal to 4 mg/l for STR. D) are Escherichia coli and Streptococcus faecium. The MIC increased for the three macrolides tested.
TI  - Sensibility assay for topical agents. A new method.
AB  - We present a new laboratory method to test the sensibility of clinically isolated strains to topical agents. It is a method of dilution of the whole cream in a solid medium. The cream is weighted, suspended in sterile water, and maintained at 45 degrees C. Then a volume of that suspension is added to the agar, maintained at 45 degrees C also. The mixture is agitated and plated. Afterwards 25 strains are inoculated by a Multinoculator (Cetin, Bs. As., Argentina). After incubation (18 hours at 37 degrees C), the results are obtained by observing the presence or absence of bacterial development. The minimal inhibitory concentration is calculated as the lowest concentration that inhibited growth. It is a simple, economical, and reproducible method.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of cervical mucus in pregnant or non-pregnant women].
AB  - Antibacterial activities of human cervical mucus obtained from non-pregnant and pregnant women were tested using standard blood agar plates. The combined effect of cervical mucus with cefmetazole (CMZ) was also investigated. Obtained results are summarized as follows. 1. Cervical mucus specimens obtained from 6 subjects at 9 to 36 weeks of pregnancy showed antibacterial activity to only one strain of Bacillus subtilis among organisms tested. The cervical mucus enhanced the activity of CMZ against 1 strain of Streptococcus pyogenes and 2 strains of Micrococcus luteus, but no effect was observed against other organisms tested. 2. Cervical mucus specimens obtained from non-pregnant women showed antibacterial activities to 8 of 11 strains (72.7%) of B. subtilis tested. The cervical mucus enhanced the activities of CMZ against 1 strain of S. pyogenes and 3 strains of B. subtilis. The tested organisms included Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Bacteroides fragilis, S. pyogenes, B. subtilis, M. luteus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis, and Candida albicans, but, as described above, cervical mucus samples showed antimicrobial activities only against B. subtilis (9/17, 52.9%), and specimens obtained only from non-pregnant women or pregnant women with less than 11 weeks of pregnancy showed any antimicrobial activities.
TI  - [Effects of sulbactam on the activity of cefoperazone against various clinical isolates].
AB  - Sulbactam/Cefoperazone (SBT/CPZ) have been used in clinical infusion at ratios of 1:1 and 1:2 in Japan and U.S.A., respectively. After an administration of these drugs as a 1:1 parenteral formulation, the ratio of levels of CPZ and SBT in blood was 1:1/4 to 1:1/5 for 1 to 2 hours, whereas the ratio of free, unbound drug levels was 1:1.4 to 1:1.5. In urine these drugs were excreted at a ratio between 1:1 and 1:4 during 6 hours after the infusion. Antimicrobial interaction studies using various combinations of CPZ and SBT were performed to obtain information with respect to the effect of SBT on the antimicrobial activity of CPZ in vivo and the most appropriate ratio of these drugs for the in vitro test system. Antimicrobial activities were determined using the agar dilution method and the disk diffusion susceptibility test. SBT increased the activity of CPZ against various clinical isolates tested except Enterococcus faecalis. CPZ-SBT at a fixed ratio of 1:1/5 significantly increased the antimicrobial activity of CPZ, resulting in decreases in MIC values and increases in disk inhibitory zone diameters. These drugs at ratios 1:1 to 1:3 maximized the synergistic enhancement of the activity. Therefore, a fixed ratio between 1:1/5 and 1:1 would be appropriate for the in vitro antimicrobial test system using either the agar dilution method or the disk susceptibility test. Based on pharmacokinetic data for CPZ and SBT, results of the present study on antimicrobial activity would support that the parenteral formulation of CPZ-SBT at the fixed ratios of 1:1 and 2:1 for the intravenous infusion used in Japan and U.S.A., respectively, are appropriate. The effect of SBT on the activity of CPZ was more marked against clinical isolates with greater production abilities of beta-lactamase than against those with less production abilities. SBT/CPZ, however, exerted a synergistic effect against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus without beta-lactamase production. The MIC80 of SBT/CPZ (1:1) against various clinical isolates with 10(6) CFU/ml inoculum size were as follows: S. aureus 12.5 micrograms/ml, Staphylococcus epidermis 3.13 micrograms/ml, and E. faecalis 50 micrograms/ml. Those of Gram-negative bacilli were: Escherichia coli 0.20 microgram/ml, Klebsiella pneumoniae 0.20 micrograms/ml, Proteus mirabilis 0.78 microgram/ml, Proteus vulgaris 0.78 microgram/ml, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 12.5 micrograms/ml, Serratia marcescens 25 micrograms/ml, Enterobacter spp. 3.13 micrograms/ml, Citrobacter spp. 12.5 micrograms/ml and Acinetobacter spp. 0.78 microgram/ml.
TI  - [Studies of lomefloxacin in biliary tract infections].
AB  - Lomefloxacin (NY-198), a new antimicrobial quinolone, was examined for its antimicrobial activities against clinical isolates and clinical efficacies to biliary tract infections. The following results were obtained. 1. The MICs of NY-198 against Escherichia coli (20 strains) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (20 strains) were good and similar to those of ofloxacin (OFLX) or norfloxacin (NFLX). The MICs of NY-198 against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (20 strains) were inferior by 1 dilution factor to OFLX or NFLX, and against Enterococcus faecalis (10 strains), they were similar to NFLX and slightly inferior to OFLX. 2. NY-198 was administered to 8 patients with biliary tract infections (acute cholecystitis 7 cases, chronic cholangitis 1 case). The results were good in 7 and unevaluable in 1 case because the duration of the therapy was too short. 3. As for side effects, mild urticaria was observed in 1 case and epigastralgia with nausea in another. As for abnormal laboratory test values slight elevations of GOT and GPT were recognized in 1 case. 4. In conclusion, we consider NY-198 is a useful oral drug for the treatment of biliary tract infections.
TI  - The high-affinity K+-translocating ATPase complex from Bacillus acidocaldarius consists of three subunits.
AB  - Cells of the thermoacidophilic bacterium Bacillus acidocaldarius express a high-affinity K+-uptake system when grown at low external K+. A vanadate-sensitive, K+- and Mg2+-stimulated ATPase was partially purified from membranes of these cells by solubilization with a non-ionic detergent followed by ion-exchange chromatography of the extract. Combinations of non-denaturing and denaturing electrophoretic separation methods revealed that the ATPase complex consisted of three subunits with molecular weights almost identical to those of the KdpA, B and C proteins, which together form the Kdp high-affinity, K+-translocating ATPase complex of Escherichia coli. The affinity of the partially purified ATPase from B. acidocaldarius for its substrates K+ (Km 2-3 microM) and ATP (Km 80 microM), its stimulation by various divalent cations, and its inhibition by vanadate (Ki 1-2 microM), bafilomycin A1 (Ki 20 microM), DCCD (Ki 200 microM) or Ca2+ were also similar to those of the E. coli enzyme, indicating that the two K+-translocating ATPases have almost identical properties.
TI  - [The sequence of specific immune reactions at the biliary level after oral vaccination].
AB  - The appearance and the progression of the specific immunoreactions at biliary levels (agglutinant titre, immunoenzimatic titration of IgAGM, IgA, IgG) in rabbits treated per os from 1 to 10 times, daily or bi-weekly, with 20 and 40 milliard of inactivated bacterial antigens (E. coli, Proteus vulgaris, Staph. aureus, Str. faecalis) have been studied. The appearance of the specific biliary antibodies has been very precocious (only one day after the first administration) and the values increased progressively with the number of administrations. The posology of 40 milliard and the bi-weekly sequence of the treatments presented the highest immunoreactions. In the bile the IgA and IgG increased considerably, but the IgA have been preponderant; in the serum only the IgG presented a remarkable increase, not the IgA, that are present in very small quantity.
TI  - Polymicrobial septicemia with Clostridium difficile in acute diverticulitis.
AB  - A case is reported of a patient without previous gastrointestinal symptoms, who presented with polymicrobial septicemia caused by Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Clostridium difficile and Bacteroides vulgatus. Septicemia occurred during acute diverticulitis. A strain of Clostridium difficile, which was of the same serogroup C as the blood culture isolate and also produced toxin, was recovered from the stools, but the pathogenic role of this organism in the gastrointestinal symptomatology was not clearly established. Other reported cases of Clostridium difficile septicemia are also reviewed.
TI  - [Bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies of sulbactam/ampicillin in the pediatric field].
AB  - The usefulness of sulbactam/ampicillin (SBT/ABPC) in the treatment of pediatric infections was evaluated. 1. Twenty pediatric patients with infection were treated with SBT/ABPC and an intravenous dosage of 27.8-47.4 mg/kg, 3 to 4 times a day. Clinical efficacies in 18 patients excluding 2 patients of Mycoplasma pneumonia (9 cases of pneumonia, 6 urinary tract infection, 1 tonsillitis, 1 maxillary sinusitis and 1 osteomyelitis) were judged to be excellent in 13 patients and good in 5. There was no case of failure. 2. Bacteriological efficacies against 16 strains (1 Staphylococcus aureus, 3 Enterococcus faecalis, 4 Haemophilus influenzae, 2 Haemophilus parainfluenzae, 5 Escherichia coli and 1 Serratia sp.) isolated from 13 of the 18 patients were rated as "eradicated" for 13 strains, "decreased" for 1 and "unchanged" for 2 with an eradication rate of 81.3%. Of 13 strains eradicated, 3 were those with high beta-lactamase productivity. 3. Rash as a side effect developed in 1 patient and eosinophilia and elevated GOT and GPT were observed in 7 patients but none of them were serious. 4. Blood levels of the drug following an intravenous dose of 30 mg/kg were determined in 2 pediatric patients. Blood levels of SBT and ABPC at 30 minutes after intravenous administration were 19.0 and 29.2 micrograms/ml in one patient and 21.0 and 31.6 micrograms/ml in another, respectively, and those at 4 hours were 0.48 and 0.62 microgram/ml in one patient and 0.59 and 0.89 microgram/ml in another, respectively. The half-lives of SBT were 0.67 and 0.70 hour and those of ABPC were 0.64 and 0.69 hour in the 2 patients, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic and bacteriological studies on sulbactam/ampicillin in the field of pediatrics].
AB  - Pharmacokinetic and bacteriological studies were carried out on sulbactam/ampicillin (SBT/ABPC) in the field of pediatrics. The results obtained are summarized as follows: 1. A total of 248 clinical isolates were employed to determine minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of SBT/ABPC against various bacterial species. SBT/ABPC showed stronger antibacterial activity against Gram-positive organisms than against Gram-negative rods. 2. The peak serum level of ABPC was about twice as high as that of SBT, and serum levels of ABPC and SBT declined with time. Both drugs showed almost the same trend of changes in concentrations. The half-lives of both drugs were about 1 hour. 3. The urinary recovery rates over 6 hours after administration were 52-80% for ABPC and 70-73% for SBT. 4. The effect of SBT/ABPC on coagulation system was examined. No case showed changes in PT, APTT, TT and HPT before and after administration of SBT/ABPC. Platelet aggregation during administration of SBT/ABPC was slightly faster than that before administration, suggesting that SBT/ABPC had no effect on platelet aggregation. Generally speaking, it seemed that SBT/ABPC was a safe antibiotic for bleeding. 5. The effect of SBT/ABPC on the intestinal bacterial flora in experimental animals was examined. Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacteroides fragilis and Bifidobacterium breve were reduced after administration of SBT/ABPC, suggesting that the intestinal bacterial flora was affected by the administration of SBT/ABPC more greatly than by the administration of ABPC alone. In a similar investigation being made with clinical cases, both aerobes and anaerobes showed great changes. Concentrations of the drugs in feces increased with increasing dosage, resulting in greater changes of the intestinal bacterial flora. Thus, the total number of aerobes and anaerobes was reduced. No diarrhea was observed in any subjects examined. From the above results, it appeared that SBT/ABPC was a safe and useful antibiotic for various bacterial infections in the field of pediatrics.
TI  - Intra-abdominal sepsis after hepatic resection.
AB  - One hundred and thirty hepatic resections performed over an 8-year period were reviewed for evidence of postoperative intra-abdominal sepsis. Of 126 patients who survived for more than 24 hours after operation, 36 developed culture positive intra-abdominal collections (28.6%). Significant independent variables associated with the development of intra-abdominal sepsis were diagnoses of trauma or cholangiocarcinoma, and the need for reoperation to control hemorrhage during the postoperative period. Before 1984, infected fluid collections were treated predominantly by operative drainage, but this has largely been replaced by percutaneous methods, which have proven effective in most cases. Eighteen (50%) of the infections were caused by a mixed bacterial culture, with Streptococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli being the most common isolates. Six patients with clinical signs of sepsis had a sterile fluid collection drained with complete relief of symptoms. This review suggests that intra-abdominal sepsis is a frequent complication after hepatic resection, and can often be managed successfully by nonoperative percutaneous drainage.
TI  - Effect of rice fiber on human fecal microflora.
AB  - The effects of brown rice, containing fourfold as much dietary fiber as polished  rice, on the human fecal microflora were determined. Significantly increased numbers of Bifidobacterium adolescentis and Enterococcus faecalis were observed during the brown rice intake, whereas the total counts and the numbers of bacteroides, Eubacterium aerofaciens, and Escherichia coli during the intake were lower than those before and after the intake. Lower numbers of clostridia and low incidences of Clostridium paraputrificum and C. perfringens were observed during the brown rice intake.
TI  - Incidence of several pathogens and staphylococcal enterotoxins in Kariesh cheese.
AB  - One hundred samples of Kariesh cheese were randomly collected from Fayoum markets and examined for the incidence of enterococci, coliform organisms, staphylococci, Salmonella and detection of staphylococcal enterotoxins A, B, C, and D. The average total count was 16.4 x 10(7) c.f.u./gm. Coliform bacteria were present in the all the examined, samples with an average of 18.9 x 10(3) c.f.u./gm. However, all samples were free from salmonella. Faecal streptococci and staphylococci were also found in average numbers of (16 x 10(5) c.f.u./gm and 92 x 10(3) c.f.u./gm). Enterotoxins A, B, C and D were not detected in any of the samples tested.
TI  - [Effect of selected bacteria on mycelial transformation of cells of Candida albicans].
AB  - Influence of selected bacteria representing typical physiological flora of mucous membranes of man on transformation of Candida albicans from yeast phase to mycelial phase was evaluated, E. coli, S. viridans and S. faecalis inhibited to different degree mycelial transformation of fungal cells. A degree of inhibition in the case of E. coli was proportional to the period of preliminary culture of strains in medium containing serum while streptococci inhibited mycelial transformation mainly after 4 and 24 hr of preliminary culture. Production of factor(s) inhibiting mycelial transformation of C. albicans by E. coli was induced by direct contact with fungal cells and by low molecular weight substances produced by C. albicans. Streptococci produced inhibiting factors even when fungal cells or their metabolites were absent in the medium.
TI  - Bactericidal and bacteriolytic action of peptide antibiotic AS-48 against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and other organisms.
AB  - A purified peptide antibiotic AS-48 from Streptococcus faecalis spp liquiefaciens S-48 exerted a bactericidal mode of action against most Gram-positive and many Gram-negative bacteria tested. In many Gram-positive bacteria and the two Myxococcus species assayed, a bacteriolytic effect, as a consequence of primary lesions, was also observed. In general, the Gram-negative bacteria were more resistant to AS-48. Escherichia coli protoplasts showed increased sensitivity and those of a resistant yeast. Saccharomyces cerevisiae 3.2, became sensitive. These data suggest that resistance is related to the cell wall structure. AS-48 adsorbed rapidly to cell walls and cytoplasmic membranes of sensitive and resistant cells. Adsorption to cytoplasmic membranes involved complete neutralization of AS-48.
TI  - Study on pathogenesis of Enterococcus faecalis in urinary tract.
AB  - The rate of isolation of Enterococcus faecalis as the causative bacterium of complicated urinary tract infections has been increasing. However, the pathogenicity of this bacterium in the urinary tract has not been clarified. Thus, the authors investigated how E. faecalis is pathogenic to the urinary tract, using mice with experimental urinary tract infection. The investigation revealed that this bacterium when sufficiently numerous can be directly pathogenic. The bacterium can be pathogenic indirectly when present with other typical urinary bacteria such as E. coli.
TI  - [Factors of protracted and recurrent course of chronic erosions of the stomach].
AB  - A study was made of the disease pathogenesis in 58 patients with recurrent chronic erosions of the gastric mucosa. It has been established that an important role in the relapses of the pathological process is played by pathological microflora, disturbances in humoral immunity and local microcirculation, and long existence of the zone of fibrinoid necrosis.
TI  - Partial nucleotide sequence of the pts operon in Salmonella typhimurium: comparative analyses in five bacterial genera.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of a Salmonella typhimurium DNA segment of 549 base pairs which encompasses the operator-promoter of the pts operon, the entirety of the ptsH gene, encoding HPr of the phosphotransferase system (PTS), the first 29 nucleotides of the ptsI gene, encoding Enzyme I of the PTS, and the intercistronic region between the ptsH and ptsI genes was determined and compared with the corresponding sequence from Escherichia coli (De Reuse et al., 1985). The two sequences showed 91% overall identity, with some regions showing sequence conservation and others exhibiting relative divergence. Two open reading frames were identified in both species: one encoded HPr on the 'sense' strand (255 nucleotides; 12 nucleotide differences, no amino acid differences); the other, on the anti-sense strand, consisted of 291 nucleotides (13 nucleotide differences, 13 amino acid differences). While HPr bears a net negative charge, the putative protein encoded by the open reading frame on the anti-sense strand is strongly basic. Computer analyses of HPr proteins from five different bacterial genera revealed four regions which show strong sequence identity and therefore are presumed to be critical for maintenance of biological activity. Two of these regions were specific to Gram-positive bacteria. Proposed functions for each of these regions are discussed. Relative evolutionary distances between the HPr proteins were also computed.
TI  - Phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system of Bacillus subtilis: nucleotide sequence of ptsX, ptsH and the 5'-end of ptsI and evidence for a ptsHI operon.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of a 1689bp fragment of the Bacillus subtilis locus containing ptsX (a crr-like gene), ptsH (coding for HPr), and the 5'-end of ptsI (coding for Enzyme I) was determined. The deduced amino acid sequences of ptsH and the N-terminal part of ptsI were compared to those of Streptococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli. Transcription fusion demonstrated that ptsHI constitutes an operon. An open reading frame overlapping the main part of ptsH in the opposite sense was shown to be expressed in vivo, using protein fusions with beta-galactosidase. The deduced amino acid sequence of ptsX showed significant homology with that of Salmonella typhimurium glucose-specific Enzyme III. ptsX was preceded by an open reading frame whose amino acid sequence showed strong homology with the C-terminal part of E. coli Enzyme IIGlc.
TI  - Stimulating effect of Streptococcus faecalis on phagocytosis in gnotobiotic piglets.
AB  - The concentration of active phagocytes in peripheral blood remained in germfree pigs up to the age of one year approximately at the same level as found at the age of 7 d and did not exceed 0.3 X 10(9)/L of blood, whereas a steady increase was established in conventional pigs. Monoassociation of gnotobiotic piglets with Streptococcus faecalis increased during 24 h the concentration of circulating granulocytes and the concentration of active phagocytes. An even more pronounced effect was obtained when formolized S. faecalis cells were applied intraperitoneally to germfree piglets. This treatment elevated the phagocytosis index also in conventional piglets, as well as in germfree piglets previously given cyclophosphamide. Escherichia coli O 83 or a mixture of anaerobic bacteria did not cause any serious changes in the activity of phagocytosis in gnotobiotic piglets. S. faecalis seems to be a natural factor stimulating both the release of granulocytes from their depots as well as their phagocytic activity.
TI  - Ofloxacin susceptibility testing quality control parameters for microdilution and disk diffusion, and confirmation of disk diffusion interpretive criteria.
AB  - The susceptibilities of 221 clinical isolates to ofloxacin were tested simultaneously by broth microdilution and disk diffusion methods with commercially prepared 5-micrograms ofloxacin disks. The acceptability of the following previously proposed zone diameter breakpoints was confirmed: greater than or equal to 16 mm, susceptible; 13 to 15 mm, intermediate; less than or equal to 12 mm, resistant. On the basis of a multilaboratory collaborative study, the following are proposed as acceptable ofloxacin MIC ranges for quality control organisms: Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, 0.03 to 0.06 micrograms/ml; Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213, 0.12 to 0.5 micrograms/ml; Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 and Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, 1.0 to 4.0 micrograms/ml. Ofloxacin quality control zone diameter ranges for the disk diffusion test are tentatively proposed, but variations in the performance of different lots of Mueller-Hinton agar may prove to be a serious problem for users.
TI  - [Influence of sultamicillin on intestinal bacterial flora].
AB  - Effects of sultamicillin (SBTPC) fine granules, a new oral beta-lactam antibiotic, on the intestinal bacterial flora were studied in tetra-contaminated mice and in pediatric patients. SBTPC was administered at a dose of 100 mg/kg once a day for 5 consecutive days to mice contaminated with 4 different species of organisms: Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacteroides fragilis and Bifidobacterium breve. In all of the 4 species, bacterial populations in feces were markedly reduced on days 4 to 5 after the start of the treatment. Subjects in the pediatric study were 5 children with bacterial infections (4 boys and 1 girl) at ages from 1 year 3 months to 10 years 8 months and with their body weight ranging from 11.8 kg to 35.0 kg. SBTPC fine granule was administered at a dose of 10 mg/kg 3 to 4 times a day for 4 to 7 days. Although there were some variations in the fecal bacterial flora noticed among these subjects during the treatment, populations of main aerobes and anaerobes such as Enterobacteriaceae, Enterococcus, Bacteroides and Bifidobacterium decreased markedly in all cases. These decreases were more pronounced for anaerobes and total numbers of anaerobes were markedly reduced in all cases. Glucose non-fermenting Gram-negative rods and fungi tended to increase with administration of SBTPC fine granule. Although these changes tended to return to pre-dosing state after the cessation of the treatment with SBTPC fine granule, attention must be paid to possible occurrences of diarrhea, superinfection or bleeding tendency when treatment with the drug is continued for a long period of time. Fecal concentrations of both ampicillin and sulbactam during SBTPC fine granule treatment showed relatively high values except 1 sample with a high beta-lactamase activity in feces. These high concentrations suggest the possibility of biliary excretion of absorbed drugs and the possibility of hydrolysis of SBTPC in the intestine due to high pH. Fecal concentrations of the drug also appeared to be closely related to beta-lactamase activity in feces.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of FK482, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  - FK482 is a new orally active cephem antibiotic which offers some advantages over  the commercially available oral beta-lactam antibiotics. It displayed a broad spectrum of activity in vitro against stock strains of Gram-positive and Gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. FK482 was more active in vitro than cefixime (CFIX), cefaclor (CCL) or cephalexin (CEX) against clinical isolates of Gram-positive organisms such as methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative Staphylococci including Staphylococcus epidermidis and strains of the Streptococcus group. Moderate activity was found against methicillin-resistant S. aureus and Enterococcus faecalis. Against clinical isolates of many Gram-negative species, including opportunistic pathogens, FK482 had good in vitro activity similar or slightly inferior to that of CFIX but superior to that of CCL or CEX. However, it was clearly inferior to CFIX in activity against Serratia marcescens, and was inactive against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Strains of S. aureus resistant to methicillin were moderately susceptible to FK482. All tested strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae resistant to CCL and CEX were susceptible to FK482, as were all the strains of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae and Branhamella catarrhalis resistant to amoxicillin (AMPC). FK482, like CFIX, was relatively stable to all type of beta-lactamases except Bacteroides fragilis and its stability was superior to that of CCL or CEX. The antibacterial activity of FK482 against CSH2 strains containing ampicillin-resistance plasmids was not affected by the presence of the ampicillin resistance determinants. FK482 showed higher affinity for the penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) (3, 2 and 1) of S. aureus than did CFIX, CCL and CEX. FK482 also showed very high affinity for the PBPs (2 and 3) of E. faecalis and PBPs (3, 1a, 4, 2 and 1 bs) of E. coli. The bactericidal activity of FK482 against S. aureus was almost as strong as that of AMPC and superior to that of CCL or CEX. Against Gram-negative bacteria such as E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. mirabilis, FK482 was similar to CFIX and superior to CCL and CEX in bactericidal activity.
TI  - In vitro activity of cefixime, a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  - The in vitro activities of cefixime and seven comparative oral antimicrobials were studied. MIC90S of cefixime were 0.015-1 micrograms/ml for Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Citrobacter diversus, Proteus, Providencia, Aeromonas hydrophila and Streptococcus. MIC90S for other Enterobacteriaceae were greater than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml; 44% of those strains were inhibited by less than or equal 1 microgram/ml. Staphylococcus, Psuedomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus faecalis were resistant to cefixime.
TI  - In vivo antibacterial activity of FK482, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  - The therapeutic activities of orally administered FK482 were compared with those  of reference antibiotics against systemic and local infections with a variety of bacteria in mice and rabbits. In systemic infections in mice, oral FK482 was almost as effective as oral cefaclor (CCL) and more effective than oral cephalexin (CEX) against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis infections. However, FK482 afforded superior protective activity when given subcutaneously against E. coli infection in mice, and this activity was more potent than that of subcutaneously given CCL. In comparison with CCL, the reason that the in vivo activity of orally given FK482 against mouse systemic infections was weaker than had been anticipated from its potent in vitro activity was due to its poor oral absorption in mice. In local infections in rabbits, a species in which FK482 was better absorbed than in mice, FK482 was more effective than CCL, CEX or amoxicillin (AMPC). Against pneumonia induced by S. aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes, FK482 was as effective as AMPC and more effective than CCL in reducing the number of viable bacteria in the lungs of infected rabbits. In the oral treatment of experimental ascending pyelonephritis in rabbits, FK482 was superior to CCL and AMPC against methicillin-resistant S. aureus infection, as effective as AMPC and more effective than CCL against Enterococcus faecalis infection, and as effective as cefixime (CFIX) and more effective than CCL and AMPC against E. coli infection in reducing the number of viable bacteria in the kidneys and urine.
TI  - In vitro activity of FCE 22101, imipenem, and ceftazidime against over 6,000 bacterial isolates and MIC quality control limits of FCE 22101.
AB  - Six geographically separate laboratories within the USA tested 6,198 bacterial isolates against FCE 22101 (a penem), imipenem (a carbapenem) and ceftazidime (a third-generation cephalosporin). Ninety-three percent of 2,749 Enterobacteriaceae were inhibited by FCE 22101, while 95% were susceptible to ceftazidime and 99% were susceptible to imipenem. FCE 22101 had little activity against Pseudomonas spp. but was active against most gram-positive pathogens, including enterococci. FCE 22101 MICs for standard quality control strains were defined as 0.5-2.0 micrograms/ml for Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, 2-8 micrograms/ml for Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212 and 0.06-0.25 microgram/ml for Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213.
TI  - [Evaluation of imipenem/cilastatin sodium in neonatal infections].
AB  - Ten patients with infections (8 neonates and 2 infants) were treated with 10.2 mg/10.2 mg/kg-37.7 mg/37.7 mg/kg of imipenem/cilastatin sodium (IPM/CS) b.i.d. or t.i.d. by a 1-hour intravenous drip infusion. The plasma concentrations of IPM/CS were determined in 5 of the 10 patients and in the cerebrospinal fluid of 1 patient of the 5. 1. The patients studied included 5 with pneumonia and 1 each with urinary tract infection, omphalitis, suspected meningitis, periproctal abscess and suspected septicemia. Clinical efficacy was evaluated in 9 patients: the patient with suspected meningitis was excluded from the clinical evaluation because the infection was doubtfully due to bacteria. Responses were excellent in 4 and good in 5 patients. No patient with a poor response was observed. All of the 6 etiological isolates obtained from 5 patients (2 strains of Staphylococcus aureus and 1 each of Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus agalactiae and Bacteroides fragilis) were eradicated. 2. As for side effects, rash was observed in 1 patient and petechiae accompanied by decreases in platelets and reticulocytes and increases in GOT and GPT were observed in another. Other abnormal laboratory test values in addition to the above abnormalities consisted of an increase in GPT in 1 patient and increases in GOT and GPT in another. These side effects and abnormalities in laboratory test values were mild and normalized after discontinuation or completion of IPM/CS administration.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Activity of amikacin and ampicillin in succession and in combination.
AB  - One strain each of Escherichia coli and Streptococcus faecalis were exposed to amikacin and ampicillin in combination as well as in succession. Exposure to ampicillin for 1 hr followed by amikacin for 3 or 4 hr had the greatest antibacterial activity when the antibiotics were applied in succession. The least effective exposures for both organisms were 1 hr to amikacin followed by 3 or 4 hr to ampicillin. Exposure to the antibiotics in combination each at 1 MIC had the overall greatest antibacterial activity. Simultaneous exposure to the antibiotic combination does not necessarily mean simultaneous activity of both ampicillin and amikacin on the E. coli. The cell wall autolytic activities produced by ampicillin are triggered within 10 min after physical contact with the bacteria. In contrast, amikacin requires at least 30 min after physical contact to manifest its activity on the ribosome. Although physical exposure to both antibiotics in the combination is simultaneous, the specific activity of each is in fact sequential, with ampicillin acting first. This explains the synergistic effect of the combination. It appears, therefore, that the synergistic or antagonistic affect of a drug combination is determined by the sequence and timing of the antibacterial manifestations of its components.
TI  - Survival of some non-starter bacteria in naturally ripened and enzyme-accelerated Cheddar cheese.
AB  - Effects of the addition of a proteinase (Neutrase 1-5S) and a peptidase (aminopeptidase DP-102) as agents for accelerating the ripening of Cheddar cheese on the survival of some non-starter bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli and a Salmonella sp.) were studied throughout a 4-month ripening period. The enzymes were found to have no significant effect on the survival of the Gram-positive bacteria but some significant effects were observed, at some stages of the ripening period, with the Gram-negative bacteria in that lower levels were recovered from cheeses treated with the enzyme system.
TI  - Cloning and expression of genes encoding pheromone-inducible antigens of Enterococcus (Streptococcus) faecalis.
AB  - Fragments, generated by restriction enzyme digestion, of the 58-kilobase Enterococcus (Streptococcus) faecalis tetracycline resistance plasmid pCF10 were cloned and introduced into Escherichia coli and E. faecalis to characterize the pheromone-inducible conjugation system encoded by this plasmid. Western blot (immunoblot) analyses revealed that a 130-kilodalton (kDa) antigen, identical to the Tra130 antigen shown previously to be involved in pCF10-mediated pheromone-inducible surface exclusion, was produced by both bacterial hosts carrying the recombinant plasmid pINY1825 (cloned EcoRI C fragment). Both bacterial hosts carrying pINY1825 also produced various amounts of immunologically related 118- to 125-kDa antigens (designated pre-Tra130) that resembled antigens produced by E. faecalis cells carrying pCF10. An additional 150-kDa antigen, Tra150, probably involved in pheromone-induced cellular aggregation, was produced by Escherichia coli and E. faecalis hosts carrying pINY1801 (cloned EcoRI C and E fragments). The coding sequences for the Tra150 and Tra130 antigens were further localized in the TRA region of pCF10 by transposon insertion mutagenesis. Western blot analyses of the recombinant strains, and of strains carrying derivatives of pCF10 or various recombinant plasmids containing Tn5 or Tn917 insertions, suggested that the portion of pCF10 comprising the tra3 through -6 segments (previously defined by Tn917 insertional mutagenesis) contained several genes that are involved in regulating the synthesis of Tra130 and Tra150.
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach for estimating effective administrative dose of cefoperazone. Evaluation of disc susceptibility test and its interpretation system].
AB  - To interpret of the cefoperazone (CPZ) disc susceptibility test, a 4 category system is used in Japan, but a 3 category system is used in the U.S.A. and Europe. In the 4 category interpretation system of Showa CPZ disc the following classification is used: ( ) MIC less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, (++) MIC greater than 3 approximately 15 micrograms/ml, (+) MIC greater than 15 approximately 60 micrograms/ml, (-) MIC greater than 60 micrograms/ml. In the 3 category system the classification used is as follows: susceptible MIC less than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml, moderately susceptible MIC greater than 16 approximately 32 micrograms/ml, resistant MIC greater than 32 micrograms/ml, or susceptible MIC less than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml, moderately susceptible MIC greater than 32 approximately 64 micrograms/ml, resistant MIC greater than 64 micrograms/ml, depending on dose levels, 1 or 2 g. Reliability of the CPZ disc susceptibility test in estimating approximate MICs by classifying the test results into 4 categories was studied using discs containing 1, 2, 5, 10, 30 and 75 micrograms. The MICs were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) CFU/ml. A good negative correlation was observed between inhibitory zone diameters and MICs, showing reliability of the test using these discs. The results obtained with discs containing 30 or 75 micrograms of CPZ were well categorized into the 4 groups mentioned above. Some strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus faecalis, however, showed false positive results. When different break points of inhibitory zone diameters than those used for other bacteria were used for P. aeruginosa, and E. faecalis was excluded from the test, an excellent correlations were obtained. With 30 or 75 micrograms discs, it was unable to subclassify strains against which MICs of CPZ were below 3 micrograms/ml. However, with discs containing 1 to 10 micrograms, it was possible to separate the strains against which MICs were less than 0.5 microgram/ml. The fact that most frequent values of MICs of CPZ against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus spp., Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pyogenes etc. were less than 0.5 microgram/ml supports the usefulness of low dose discs. According to recently ongoing concepts on the pharmacokinetics of antibiotics and their penetration into tissues and inflammatory fluids, serum protein binding appear to be one of the important determinants of drug distribution in the body. Only free, unbound drug molecules can readily pass through capillary pores into tissue fluids except into hepatic biliary system.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - A further insight into the mechanism of action of anthracycline antibiotics.
AB  - The uptake of Adriamycin (ADM) by eucaryotic and procaryotic cells and the interaction of the antibiotic with structurally organized DNA were investigated. The aim of this work was to understand why ADM is endowed with very low antibiotic activity in spite of being highly cytotoxic for mammalian cells, and to get a further insight into the mechanism of action of this compound. Spectrophotometric, fluorometric, chiroptical, and electron microscopic techniques were used. The drug was shown to concentrate in mammalian cells but failed to do so in bacteria and penetrated rather poorly in Candida albicans. The chromatin binding affinity of ADM appeared to be substantially reduced with respect to the affinity for free DNA. Complex stereochemistry was also influenced by the presence of nucleosomal arrangements in the polynucleotide. In addition, evidence was obtained that the antibiotic tended to accumulate at specific (linker) chromatin regions and to cause extensive compaction of organized DNA. The observed phenomena may play a relevant role in the mode of drug action in eucaryotic cells and help to explain the lack of antibacterial activity by ADM in spite of the apparent attainment of great enough intracellular levels to affect DNA template function.
TI  - Laboratory evaluation of disposable and reusable disinfectant cloths for cleaning food contact surfaces.
AB  - A comparison of five methods of cleaning Formica surfaces contaminated with bacteria dried in milk has been carried out. A standardized procedure was developed, and impression plates were found to be at least as sensitive as a swab-rinse method for detecting bacteria on the surfaces. The most satisfactory results were obtained with one type of disposable alcohol-impregnated wipe and with a detergent/hypochlorite solution applied with paper. A reusable cloth impregnated with disinfectant initially performed well against all test organisms, but was less reliable against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis, after the cloth had been used and rinsed several times. The importance of introducing methods to reduce the high risk of cross-contamination presently associated with the use of wiping cloths in catering premises is stressed.
TI  - An in vitro evaluation of HRE 664, a novel penem antibiotic.
AB  - HRE 664 is a novel parenteral penem with a broad antimicrobial spectrum. In this  study, HRE 664 inhibited 90% of Enterobacteriaceae at less than or equal to 2.0 micrograms/ml, Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae at less than or equal to 0.5 microgram/ml, oxacillin-susceptible staphylococci at less than or equal to 0.13 microgram/ml, oxacillin-resistant staphylococci at less than or equal to 8.0 micrograms/ml, enterococci at less than or equal to 8.0 micrograms/ml, and streptococci at less than or equal to 0.13 microgram/ml. All strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were resistant (MICs were greater than 32 micrograms/ml). HRE 664 exhibited a minimal inoculum effect and good bactericidal activity with all organisms tested except an oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. With the latter, there was a marked inoculum effect and no on-scale bactericidal endpoints. No measurable hydrolysis of HRE 664 occurred with any of the five Gram-negative bacterial beta-lactamases tested. When stored at -20 degrees C, HRE 664 showed no significant loss of activity for up to 6 wk, but detectable deterioration occurred thereafter. At -60 degrees C, no loss in HRE 664 potency was observed for up to 12 wk. Proposed HRE 664 MIC quality control parameters are: 0.03-0.13 microgram/ml for S. aureus ATCC 29213, 0.25-1.0 micrograms/ml for Escherichia coli 25922, and 2.0-8.0 micrograms/ml for Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212.
TI  - [Venous and capillary diffusion of Enterococcus faecalis during experimental bacteremia in the chicken].
AB  - Capillary and venous diffusion of bacteria were studied in chickens after intravenous inoculation with a strain of Enterococcus faecalis isolated from a case of septicaemia in a human neonate. One group of 13 chickens was inoculated with 10(8) bacteria/animal and another group of 20 chickens with 10(7) bacteria/animal. The level of bacteraemia in the first group of chickens was similar in capillary and venous blood. With 10(8) E. faecalis, the clearance of bacteria was very weak. The level of bacteraemia in the second group was significantly higher (after 180 min) in capillary than in venous blood, which suggests slower bacterial clearance in capillary than in venous blood. However, clearance was more efficient with the inoculum of 10(7) E. faecalis than with the first type of inoculum. These experimental data confirm the greater sensitivity of capillary rather than venous sampling, which we have already observed in chickens, under similar experimental conditions, with Escherichia coli K12. Persistence of bacteria in the capillaries could account for the higher level of sensitivity of capillary microblood culture than venous blood culture, which is in agreement with the capillary trapping hypothesis of Knudson and Alden.
TI  - Conjugative plasmid transfer from Enterococcus faecalis to Escherichia coli.
AB  - The possibility of transfer of genetic information by conjugation from gram-positive to gram-negative bacteria was investigated with a pBR322-pAM beta 1 chimeric plasmid, designated pAT191. This shuttle vector, which possesses the tra functions of the streptococcal plasmid pAM beta 1, was conjugatively transferred from Enterococcus faecalis to Escherichia coli with an average frequency of 5 x 10(-9) per donor colony formed after mating.
TI  - [Survival of pathogenic microorganisms in snow].
AB  
TI  - Tn916 delta E: a Tn916 transposon derivative expressing erythromycin resistance.
AB  - The tetracycline resistance gene encoded within the transposon Tn916 was replaced with the gene encoding erythromycin resistance from the plasmid pVA838. The derivative transposon of Tn916 was designated Tn916 delta E and was introduced into the Streptococcus faecalis chromosome by protoplast transformation. The conjugation/transposition functions of Tn916 delta E were similar to those observed for Tn916 in S. faecalis and Tn916 delta E was capable of self-conjugation at frequencies similar to those of other S. faecalis and Group B Streptococcus. This transposon will be useful for mutagenesis studies in gram-positive organisms, especially in those species where erythromycin resistance is a more desirable selectable marker.
TI  - In vitro activity of U-76,252 (CS-807), a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  - U-76,252 is the prodrug of U-76,253. MICs of U-76,253 were 0.015 to 0.06 microgram/ml for greater than or equal to 90% of the strains of Streptococcus spp., Haemophilus influenzae, and Proteus mirabilis; 0.25 to 1 microgram/ml for Branhamella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., and Citrobacter diversus; 1 to 8 micrograms/ml for Staphylococcus spp.; and 2 to greater than 16 micrograms/ml for other members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and Aeromonas hydrophila; for 72% of the latter group, MICs were less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml. MICs for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus faecalis were greater than 16 micrograms/ml.
TI  - Ciprofloxacin in combination with metronidazole.
AB  - Ciprofloxacin has a reduced activity against anaerobic pathogens. Therefore, a combination of ciprofloxacin with an antimicrobial agent active against anaerobes, such as metronidazole, seems to be interesting for the treatment of mixed aerobic/anaerobic infections. High metronidazole concentrations (10 mg/l or 40 mg/l) neither affected the bactericidal efficacy of ciprofloxacin on aerobic pathogens, such as Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus faecalis, nor on the anaerobic pathogens Clostridium perfringens and Clostridium difficile, as demonstrated by kill-kinetic curves. The same high concentrations, as well as lower therapeutically achievable concentration (2 mg/l or 5 mg/l) of metronidazole in combination with ciprofloxacin were slightly more potent for the tested clostridia than ciprofloxacin or metronidazole alone.
TI  - Suitability of a propanolic PVP-iodophor preparation as preoperative skin disinfectant: germicidal activity and chemical stability.
AB  - The preparation Solutio Betadini propanolica 3% w/w, used as a pre-operative skin disinfectant was examined for its germicidal activity and its chemical stability. The additive activity of iodine and propanol resulted in a wide range of antimicrobial activity against bacteria, including bacterial spores, and fungi, with a rapid onset and sustained duration of action. The solution is easily manufactured and analyzed, its stability is guaranteed for 6 months. Because of its staining property, there is no need of coloured additives to mark the disinfected area. In addition, no skin irritations by the disinfectant were observed so far. Thus, the preparation fulfills the essential requirements for preoperative skin disinfectants and is suitable for the preparation and the compounding in hospital pharmacies.
TI  - Sequence analysis of termini of conjugative transposon Tn916.
AB  - Transposon Tn916 is a 16.4-kilobase, broad-host-range, conjugative transposon originally identified on the chromosome of Enterococcus (Streptococcus) faecalis DS16. Its termini have been sequenced along with the junction regions for two different insertions. The ends were found to contain imperfect inverted repeat sequences with identity at 20 of 26 nucleotides. Further in from the ends, imperfect directly repeated sequences were present, with 24 of 27 nucleotides matching. The transposon junction regions contained homologous segments but of a nature not consistent with a direct duplication of the target sequence. Within the right terminus was a potential outwardly reading promoter. Tn916 is believed to transpose via an excision-insertion mechanism; based on the analyses of the termini, as well as two target sequences (before insertion and after excision), a possible model is suggested.
TI  - The production of anorexigenic substances by intestinal flora.
AB  - The role of intestinal flora in the production of anorexigenic substance was investigated. Proteus mirabilis (P. mirabilis) and Escherichia coli (E. coli) were found to produce an anorexigenic substance, while Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis, type 1 and 2) and Staphylococcus intermedius (S. intermedius) did not. The anorexigenic substance was purified and was detected as, a single though broad band by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The specific activity of the final form of the purified substance was 120 units/mg carbohydrate. The substance contained no protein residue and appeared to be a lipopolysaccharide. The evidence that intestinal flora produces an anorexigenic substance leads to an interesting assumption that the intestinal flora may be responsible for regulating food intake.
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach in estimating the effective dosage of cefamandole].
AB  - Reliability of the cefamandole (CMD) disc susceptibility test in estimating approximate values of MICs was studied using various clinical isolates totaling 246 strains with Showa discs (8 mm diameter containing 30 micrograms of CMD). Clinical significance of a 4 category system for the interpretation of the CMD disc tests, which is normally used in Japan, was also evaluated to determine whether this system would be suitable or not for the evaluation of a proper dose of administration. The results obtained with the disc method were compared with MICs determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) CFU/ml. The results of the CMD disc susceptibility test were well correlated with MICs, showing the reliability of the disc method to estimate approximate values of MICs. Break points in MIC values proposed for the classification of bacteria into 4 categories of susceptibility are () MIC less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, (++) MIC greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, (+) MIC greater than 15-60 micrograms/ml, (-) MIC greater than 60 micrograms/ml. Only 4 (1.6%) out the 246 strains tested showed false positive results and 11 (4.5%) showed false negative results, showing the excellent reliability of this test. In this study, approximately 90% of strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis isolated from clinical materials randomly were inhibited by CMD at concentrations less than 3.13 micrograms/ml. Proteus vulgaris and Enterobacter aerogenes were sensitive to CMD at 67 and 69% of strains, respectively, at concentrations below 6.25 micrograms/ml. CMD was not active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens and Enterococcus faecalis. About 90% of Staphylococcus aureus were inhibited at dose levels smaller than 6.25 micrograms/ml and 70% of the strains at levels less than 3.13 micrograms/ml. Susceptibilities to 15 micrograms/ml CMD of highly methicillin-resistant strains (MIC greater than 30 micrograms/ml) of S. aureus were examined. Ten of 12 strains examined were found susceptible to CMD, but only 6 of the 12 to cefmetazole. Imipenem/cilastatin was effective to 5 of the 12 strains at levels lower than 3 micrograms/ml and to one at a level less than 15 micrograms/ml. Minocycline was effective against 11 strains at concentrations below 2 micrograms/ml.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of a new fluorinated 4-quinolone, T-3262 (A-60969).
AB  - The in vitro activity of a new quinolone, T-3262 [A-60969; DL-7-(3-amino-1-pyrrolidinyl)-1-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-6-fluoro-1-, 4-dihydro-4-oxo-1,8-naphthyridine-3-carboxylic acid monohydrate], was compared with those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, ceftazidime, imipenem, and gentamicin. T-3262 inhibited 90% of isolates of the family Enterobacteriaceae at a concentration of less than or equal to 0.25 micrograms/ml. It was two to four times more active than ofloxacin and similarly or slightly less active than ciprofloxacin. Ninety percent of isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were inhibited at 0.5 micrograms/ml. It was 4- to 8-fold more active than ciprofloxacin and 8- to 16-fold more active than ofloxacin against Pseudomonas cepacia and Pseudomonas maltophilia, which were resistant to imipenem and gentamicin. Most Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Branhamella catarrhalis isolates were inhibited at concentrations of less than or equal to 0.008 micrograms/ml. The MIC for 90% of the Staphylococcus aureus isolates, including methicillin-resistant S. aureus, was 0.12 micrograms/ml; that for Staphylococcus epidermidis was 0.5 micrograms/ml, as was that for Enterococcus faecalis. It inhibited 90% of Bacteroides fragilis isolates at 2 micrograms/ml, considerably more active than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. The frequency of spontaneous point mutational resistance was less than 10(-10) for members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas spp. Resistant strains could be selected by repeated subculture. Similar to other quinolones, its activity could be affected by culture conditions. T-3262 showed a postantibiotic suppressive effect on Escherichia coli, P. aeruginosa, and S. aureus.
TI  - [Use of ceftriaxone against parametritis after radical surgery for cancer of the  uterine cervix].
AB  - 1. The bacteria isolated from pelvic dead space drainage well reflect the characteristics of prophylactic drugs. As drugs advance from penicillin (PC) to tetracycline (TC) to the first, second and third generation cephems, detection rates for Gram-negative bacilli, mainly Escherichia coli, decrease remarkably, while those for Gram-positive cocci, mainly Enterococcus faecalis, increase. 2. The bacteria isolated from the drainage and those which later caused parametritis and purulent lymphocyst were closely related. It is therefore very important to identify bacteria present in the drainage. 3. Judging from changes occurred in blood levels of ceftriaxone (CTRX) and its effective transfer to the pelvic dead space when CTRX 2 g was administered once daily, this administration regimen is considered to control even parametritis and purulent lymphocyst satisfactorily. 4. CTRX 2 g was administered once daily for 5 consecutive days to each of 4 patients with parametritis, and it was observed that the general efficacy was good in 3 of the 4 cases.
TI  - [Evolution from 1976 to 1986 of bacterial prevalence and sensitivity to urinary antibiotics of bacteria isolated from urine cultures at a city microbiology laboratory].
AB  - The evolution of the prevalence of the bacterial strains isolated from UTI cases  (bacteriuria greater than or equal to 10(5)/ml has been studied over a 11 year-period from 1976 to 1986, in a clinical practice microbiological laboratory from a rural area. E. coli was the overall most frequently isolated species, followed by P. mirabilis (74.4% and 11.2% respectively), by the Klebsiella-Enterobacter group (4.8%), and staphylococci (represented by coagulase negative staphylococci) (4.9%). The relative frequency of the different species has been relatively stable year after year during the considered period. The evolution of the resistance to 4 antibiotics has been studied species by species and year after year for the Gram negative bacilli: a definite evolution towards resistance has been noted for ampicillin until 1985, followed by a decrease in 1986. The same tendency, although less pronounced, has been noted for cotrimoxazole. The frequency of the resistance to nalidixic acid has slightly increased from 1976 to 1986 (1.9% to 6.5%), as well as to pipemidic acid from (0% to 4%). The quinolones stand in 1987 as a good first line treatment of UTI in community, and especially in rural areas, and the role of the clinical practice microbiological laboratory for the epidemiological surveillance has to be stressed.
TI  - Activity of E-3846, a new fluoroquinolone, in vitro and in experimental cystitis  and pyelonephritis in rats.
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activity of E-3846, a new fluoroquinolone carboxylic acid derivative with a pyrrol ring substituent at position 7, was evaluated in comparison with norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin. E-3846 was more active than the reference quinolones against Staphylococcus species, including methicillin-resistant strains. E-3846 was similar to ciprofloxacin and more active than norfloxacin against Streptococcus (Enterococcus) faecalis. In general, E-3846 was more active than norfloxacin against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, but less active than ciprofloxacin. For Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the MICs giving 90% inhibition for E-3846, norfloxacin, and ciprofloxacin were 2, 1, and 0.25 micrograms/ml, respectively. The activity of E-3846 increased at acid pH; in contrast, acid pH caused a pronounced decrease in the activity of norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin. In vivo, E-3846 demonstrated excellent therapeutic efficacy in treating experimental S. faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa cystitis and pyelonephritis in rats.
TI  - Transformation of bacteria with plasmid DNA by electroporation.
AB  - The possibility of electric field-mediated transformation ("electroporation") of  a gram-positive bacterium (Enterococcus faecalis) and two gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida) with plasmid DNA was investigated. E. faecalis protoplasts could be transformed by electroporation with a transformation frequency of 10(4) to 10(5) transformants/micrograms plasmid. Untreated--i.e., washed--cells of E. coli could be transformed with rates of 1 X 10(5) transformants/micrograms plasmid DNA. Transformation rates for P. putida cells were up to 3 X 10(4) if the method developed for E. coli was used. Detailed protocols for these systems, including the results of various optimization experiments, are given.
TI  - Evidence for natural gene transfer from gram-positive cocci to Escherichia coli.
AB  - High-level resistance to macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin type B (MLS) antibiotics in Escherichia coli BM2570 is due to the presence on the conjugative plasmid pIP1527 of the MLS resistance determinant ermBC, which is almost identical to the erm genes previously described in plasmid pAM77 from Streptococcus sanguis (ermAM) and in transposon Tn917 from Enterococcus faecalis (ermB). This gene and its regulatory region are located downstream from the insertion sequence IS1. The 23S rRNA methylase encoded by pIP1527 differs by three and six amino acids from those encoded by Tn917 and pAM77, respectively. Unlike the streptococcal elements which confer the inducible MLS phenotype, the ermBC gene is expressed constitutively in E. coli and Bacillus subtilis, due to several mutations in the regulatory region. Transcription of the ermBC gene starts from three different sites following three overlapping promoters which function in both E. coli and B. subtilis. Promoters P2 and P3 are located within the region homologous to pAM77 and Tn917, and P1 is a hybrid promoter constituted by -35 and -10 sequences located at the end of IS15 and in the streptococcal region, respectively. These results constitute evidence for the recent in vivo transfer from Streptococcus spp. to E. coli. This transfer could have been mediated by transposons such as Tn917 or Tn1545 from Streptococcus pneumoniae, which also bears an MLS determinant that is homologous to ermB. We speculate that the insertion sequences IS15 and IS1 could have played a role in the expression and dissemination of ermBC, which has been found in numerous strains of enterobacteria.

AB  - The antibiotic resistance group B streptococcal plasmids, pIP501 and pVA797, were conjugally transferred from Streptococcus faecalis to Lactobacillus plantarum. The Escherichia coli-Streptococcus shuttle plasmids, pVA838 and pSA3, were mobilized from S. sanguis to L. plantarum by pVA797 via cointegrate formation. pVA838 readily resolved from pVA797 and was present in L. plantarum as deletion derivatives. The pVA797::pSA3 cointegrate failed to resolve in L. plantarum.
TI  - [Clinical studies on effect of cefbuperazone on surgical infections].
AB  - We conducted clinical studies on the efficacy and safety of cefbuperazone (CBPZ)  on surgical infections with the following results. 1) In evaluable 32 patients, CBPZ was evaluated to be clinically effective in 23 (71.9%) and the efficacy rate was better in those who were administered 4 g/day of CBPZ (87.5%, 14/16) than in those who were given 2 g/day (57.1%, 8/14). 2) Antibacterial activity of CBPZ was evaluated in 41 isolated bacterial strains. Pathogen eradication rate by bacterial species was 75.6% (31/41). CBPZ exerted excellent antibacterial effects on Escherichia coli (100%, 8/8) and anaerobic bacteria such as Bacteroides (88.9%, 8/9). Resistant bacteria to CBPZ were Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. 3) No serious side effects were noted in any of the 34 patients who entered in this study. Abnormal laboratory test results were noted in 2 patients (5.9%) and they were transient elevation of transaminases and alkaline phosphatase. From the results shown above, CBPZ appears to be a highly useful antibiotic for the treatment of surgical infection.
TI  - Simplified methods for the microbiological evaluation of bottled natural mineral  waters.
AB  - The conventional methods for the microbiological examination of natural mineral water were compared with a simplified procedure. The results indicate that when indicator micro-organisms are present in water, they may not be detected in the simplified method. An alternative procedure, including the determination of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, is suggested.
TI  - An open study of the safety and efficacy of enoxacin in complicated urinary tract infections.
AB  - Thirty-one patients with serious or complicated urinary tract infections were treated with oral enoxacin for between four and eight days. Twenty-five patients with microbiologically confirmed infections completed treatment with 400 mg enoxacin twice daily and at the end of treatment all urine cultures were negative. At short term follow-up, five to nine days after therapy, 21 of the 25 patients were still infection free. In total, reinfection or relapse occurred in 12 patients during the four to six weeks follow up period after termination of treatment. Significant side-effects (nausea and vomiting) occurred in only one patient.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. Focusing mainly on ofloxacin (first report). Reported by the Research Group for Testing Ofloxacin Susceptibility of Clinical Isolates].
AB  - Susceptibility tests were carried out on a variety of clinically isolated pathogens using the susceptibility disc method at 197 hospitals in Japan between May, 1985 through March, 1986. These tests were organized by the Research Group for Testing Ofloxacin Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates, and the results were statistically analyzed. This paper describes a comparison of susceptibilities of clinical isolates including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Serratia marcescens, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp. and Campylobacter jejuni to ofloxacin (OFLX) and conventional antibacterial drugs. The results obtained were summarized as follows. 1. OFLX showed strong antibacterial activity against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, E. aerogenes, E. cloacae, C. freundii, K. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, H. influenzae, A. calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp. and C. jejuni and only a few strains were resistant to OFLX. Moreover, OFLX has superior antibacterial activity against many species compared not only to norfloxacin but also to most of the conventional antibacterial drugs. 2. When studied by sampled materials such as sputum, urine, abscesses and otorrhea, OFLX occasionally showed different actions against the same species from different sources. Almost species from the urinary isolates were less sensitive than those from the sputum.

TI  - Impact of cefotaxime and ceftriaxone on the bowel and vaginal flora after single-dose prophylaxis in vaginal hysterectomy.
AB  - The aim of this randomised controlled study was to investigate the effect of a preoperative, single dose, intravenous injection of ceftriaxone 2g and cefotaxime 2g in 2 groups of 30 patients who underwent vaginal hysterectomy. The parameters were: efficacy and tolerance; impact on the aerobic bowel and vaginal flora; and serum concentrations. There were no significant differences in efficacy, haematology or clinical chemistry parameters. In the ceftriaxone group 2 patients had exanthemas, 2 had diarrhoea. In the cefotaxime group no such side effects occurred. Serum concentrations were 9.75 and 0.07 mg/L for ceftriaxone and cefotaxime, respectively, after 24 and 12 hours, respectively. Ceftriaxone had a pronounced and continuous effect on the bowel flora: Streptococcus faecium and Candida spp. increased, reaching counts of 10(8) and 10(7) organisms/g faeces, respectively, at day 10. Under cefotaxime no dramatic alteration was determined and growth of Candida spp. was not influenced. Growth of Escherichia coli and other bacteria of the vaginal flora was not influenced by either drug. Overgrowth of Candida spp. under ceftriaxone was significant (p less than 0.05) compared with that under cefotaxime. The results of this study indicate that the high biliary excretion of ceftriaxone (45%) and its long acting properties are responsible for the high selection pressure and overgrowth of Candida. Cefotaxime, a drug with low biliary excretion (5%) and shorter action, had only a negligible effect on the microflora with quick normalisation. The observed overgrowth of Candida spp., even after a single injection of ceftriaxone, could cause problems when this drug is being used for surgical prophylaxis or treatment. This applies especially to immunocompromised patients.

TI  - Characterization of the 1-phosphohistidinyl residue in the phosphocarrier protein HPr of the phosphoenolpyruvate: sugar phosphotransferase system of Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - The phosphocarrier protein HPr of the bacterial phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system contains 1-phosphohistidine at residue 15. This residue and the active site residue Arg-17 are conserved in HPrs isolated from both Gram-positive and -negative bacteria. The pH- and temperature-dependent hydrolysis of the 1-phosphohistidinyl residue in P-HPr from Streptococcus faecalis has been investigated. The results show that the hydrolysis properties are very similar to those previously reported for P-HPr from Escherichia coli. It was postulated that the unusual hydrolysis properties were due to the presence of a carboxyl group at the active site, and it is now known that in HPr from Escherichia coli the C-terminal residue Glu-85 is present. The results in this paper suggest that a similar carboxyl group is present at the active site in HPr from Streptococcus faecalis.
TI  - Effect of live and heat-killed bacteria on the secretory activity of Paneth cells in germ-free mice.
AB  - Germ-free mice were given live or heat-killed facultative anaerobes, and the ultrastructure of ileal Paneth cells was quantitatively examined with special reference to secretory granules showing a bipartite substructure (central core and peripheral halo). After administering live or heat-killed bacteria, there was a decrease in the area occupied by the cores of secretory granules in Paneth cells, and exocytosed core material was observed in the crypt lumen. There were no changes in the area occupied by the halo of secretory granules. None of the examined Paneth cells phagocytosed bacteria. It is concluded that certain bacteria may affect the secretion of antibacterial agents contained in the secretory granules of Paneth cells.
TI  - Genetic organization of the bacterial conjugative transposon Tn916.
AB  - Tn916, which encodes resistance to tetracycline, is a 16.4-kilobase conjugative transposon originally identified on the chromosome of Streptococcus faecalis DS16. The transposon has been cloned in Escherichia coli on plasmid vectors, where it expresses tetracycline resistance; it can be reintroduced into S. faecalis via protoplast transformation. We have used a lambda::Tn5 bacteriophage delivery system to introduce Tn5 into numerous sites within Tn916. The Tn5 insertions had various effects on the behavior of Tn916. Some insertions eliminated conjugative transposition but not intracellular transposition, and others eliminated an excision step believed to be essential for both types of transposition. A few inserts had no effect on transposon behavior. Functions were mapped to specific regions on the transposon.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from urinary tract infections (1985). II. Background of patients].
AB  - We have investigated relationships between patients' backgrounds and isolates from urinary tract infections in reference to various conditions, such as sexes, age distribution by sex, species of causative organisms by sex, age distribution according to species and types of infections, species and infections before and after treatment with antibacterial agents, and species and detected places. As for the relationship between sexes and types of infections, although simple urinary tract infections were consistently found at about 20% in men and at about 80% in women between 1981 and 1983, these infections were seen at 24.4% in men and at 75.6% in women in 1984, and at 26.6% and at 73.4% in 1985, indicating slight decreases in the ratio of women. By contrast, complex urinary tract infections were found in men at about 60-70% from 1981 up to 1985, regardless of the presence or absence of indwelling catheter. There were no noticeable changes according to age during this 5-year period in incidences of infections including simple urinary tract infection and complex urinary tract infection with or without indwelling catheter. Thus, backgrounds of patients with urinary tract infections, including sex, age and simple or complex infections, were fairly consistent throughout this period, while there were relatively large changes in species of isolates. Enterococcus faecalis was isolated at about 8% of both men and women in 1982 and 1983, but its isolation rates were increased to 22.5% of men and 17.9% of women in 1984. In 1985 this species was isolated in 14.9% of men and 7.6% of women, and in 11.2% of all patients. Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus spp. and Enterococcus spp. were detected at rates of 3.2%, 8.1%, 0.7% and 1.0%, respectively, and 24.2% of isolated strains were Gram-positive organisms. When species of isolates before treatment with antibacterial agents and their isolation rates were analyzed, it was found that the isolation rate of E. faecalis increased dramatically in 1983, and that this tendency was still seen in 1984. The isolation rate of Gram-positive organisms was 25% in 1984 and 24.3% in 1985. Escherichia coli was consistently isolated at about 40%, but, as far as simple urinary tract infections are concerned, its isolation rate decreased by about 10% in 1985, compared to 1982 and 1983. These results suggested that causative organisms for simple urinary tract infections became similar to those for complex urinary tract infections. In other words, isolates obtained from complex urinary tract infections before treatment were similar to those of simple infections.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in cyst fluid from autosomal dominant polycystic kidneys.
AB  - Cyst infection in patients with autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is often refractory to therapy, in part because of the limited entry of commonly used antibiotics into cyst fluid. To study the efficacy of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in cyst infection, cyst fluid was obtained by percutaneous aspiration or at surgery from eight patients with ADPKD receiving trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Cysts were categorized as nongradient or gradient by cyst-fluid sodium concentration. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole concentrations within cysts were determined and cyst fluid inhibitory and bactericidal titers were assessed in vitro against Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Streptococcus fecalis. The mean cyst fluid trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole concentrations were 15.2 micrograms/ml and 42.5 micrograms/ml, respectively. Preferential accumulation of trimethoprim was observed in gradient cysts, exceeding serum levels more than eightfold. Sulfamethoxazole penetrated cysts to a lesser extent, with concentrations ranging from 10 to 70 percent of the serum level. Cyst fluid sampled prior to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole administration (control) demonstrated no antibacterial activity, while cyst fluid inhibitory and bactericidal titers following antibiotic administration were 1:32 or greater in most instances. These studies indicate that trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is likely to be efficacious in the treatment of cyst infection in polycystic kidneys.
TI  - [Detection of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria from female patients with acute uncomplicated cystitis].
AB  - A total of 122 bacterial strains isolated from urine specimens of 113 female patients with acute uncomplicated cystitis were used for the study of beta-lactamase production and their susceptibility to various antimicrobial agents was determined. Beta-Lactamase activity was qualitatively determined by a paper strip acidimetric method with benzylpenicillin as substrate and by chromogenic cephalosporin methods using pyridine-2-azo-p-dimethylaniline cephalosporin or nitrocefin as substrate. Susceptibility to antimicrobial agents, including ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalexin, cephalothin, gentamicin, minocycline, fosfomycin, pipemidic acid and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim was examined by a disc method. The beta-lactamase-producing strains detected by at least one of the three tests were found in 18 of 105 Escherichia coli isolates and in the single strain of Enterobacter cloacae dermidis, 3 Enterococcus faecalis and 1 Staphylococcus aureus produced beta-lactamase. The isolation rate of strains resistant to ampicillin, carbenicillin and cephalothin in the beta-lactamase-producing strains was significantly higher than that in the non-beta-lactamase-producing strains (p less than 0.01). These results suggest that beta-lactamase plays an important role in developing resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics in patients with uncomplicated urinary tract infection as well as complicated infection.
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach for estimating the effective administrative dose of latamoxef. Significance of a 4-category system interpretation of the latamoxef disc susceptibility test].
AB  - In vitro activities of latamoxef (LMOX) against 249 clinical isolates were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) CFU/ml. LMOX was highly active against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis (except 2 out of 30 strains) and Proteus vulgaris with MIC values below 3.13 micrograms/ml. It was also active against Enterobacter aerogenes with MIC80 of 1.56 micrograms/ml. LMOX was less active against Serratia marcescens, inhibiting about 43% of strains at a level of 6.25 micrograms/ml. It was also less active against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, showing MIC80 of 12.5 and 50 micrograms/ml, respectively. LMOX was not active against Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The reliability of the LMOX disc diffusion susceptibility test for quantitative estimation of antimicrobial activities was also investigated using 8 mm diameter discs (Showa) and 6 mm diameter discs (Difco), both of which contained 30 micrograms/disc of LMOX. These disc susceptibility test results were well correlated with MICs, hence the LMOX disc susceptibility test should be useful for the estimation of proper dose levels of LMOX. For the interpretation of LMOX disc test results, if uniform break points of zone diameters were used to test all bacteria, inhibitory zone diameters of Showa discs used on Staphylococcus were relatively large compared to MICs determined, probably due to decarboxylation of LMOX sodium salt in the discs. However, those of Difco discs were not, because Difco discs use LMOX ammonium salt. Both discs also showed relatively large inhibitory zone diameters compared to MICs determined against P. aeruginosa. Using different break points from those used for other bacteria to interpret inhibition zones for Staphylococcus and P. aeruginosa, these disc susceptivility tests should be useful to estimate approximate MICs. A 3 category system for the interpretation of disc test results has been used in USA and Europe, but a 4 category system is generally used in Japan. The 3 category system uses break points to classify bacteria into 3 categories of susceptibility according to MIC values as follows: Resistant (R) MIC greater than or equal to 64 micrograms/ml, intermediate (I) MIC 16-32 micrograms/ml, and susceptible (S) MIC less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml. The 4 category system uses break points as follows: MIC less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, MIC greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, (+) MIC greater than 15-60 micrograms/ml, (-) MIC greater than 60 micrograms/ml.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Assessment of antiseptic bladder washout procedures using a physical model of the catheterised bladder.
AB  - A simple physical model of the catheterised bladder has been used to assess the activities of antiseptic agents that have been recommended as bladder instillations in the treatment of urinary tract infections in patients with indwelling catheters. The activities of povidone-iodine, phenoxyethanol, chlorhexidine, chlorhexidine supplemented with EDTA + Tris, noxythiolin and neomycin were examined against selected species of uropathogens. Except for phenoxyethanol against Pv. stuartii and possibly Ps. aeruginosa, single applications of these antibacterials for 30 min were not effective in sterilising urine in the artificial bladder. However, a second application 1 h later of phenoxyethanol but not chlorhexidine or povidone-iodine did eradicate Ps. aeruginosa. It is suggested that bacteria growing as a film on the bladder wall are particularly resistant to antimicrobials.
TI  - Disk diffusion susceptibility testing and broth microdilution quality control guidelines for BMY-28100, a new orally administered cephalosporin.
AB  - The BMY-28100 30-micrograms-disk test was evaluated by using 615 clinical isolates. Regression analyses and error rates were determined, leading to the recommendation of greater than or equal to 18-mm zone diameters (MIC correlate, greater than or equal to 8.0 micrograms/ml) for susceptibility and less than or equal to 14-mm zone diameters (MIC correlate, greater than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml) for resistance. Nearly all false-susceptible disk test results were among the Providencia spp. and the beta-lactamase-positive Haemophilus influenzae strains. Susceptibility disk test results for these species should be interpreted with caution. The following broth microdilution MIC quality control guidelines were determined from results of a multilaboratory trial: Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, 1.0 to 4.0 micrograms/ml; Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, 4.0 to 16 micrograms/ml; Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213, 0.25 to 1.0 microgram/ml; and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, greater than 32 micrograms/ml.
TI  - Production of staphylococcal enterotoxin in mixed cultures.
AB  - Two Staphylococcus aureus strains were grown in brain-heart infusion (BHI) broth  and a meat medium with Bacillus cereus, Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Both S. aureus strains grew well and produced enterotoxin in the presence of S. faecalis in BHI broth; however, enterotoxin production was observable in the meat medium only when the S. aureus inoculum was greater than the S. faecalis inoculum. S. aureus FRI-100 grown with B. cereus produced enterotoxin in both media only when the S. aureus inoculum was much higher than the B. cereus inoculum (10 versus 10(4) CFU), whereas S. aureus FRI-196E produced enterotoxin in both media at all inoculum combinations except in the meat medium, when the inocula of the two organisms were the same. S. aureus grown with E. coli in BHI broth produced enterotoxin at all inoculum combinations except when the E. coli inoculum was greater than the S. aureus inoculum; however, in the meat medium, enterotoxin was produced only when the S. aureus inoculum was much greater than the E. coli inoculum (10 versus 10(4) CFU), S. aureus FRI-100 grown with P. aeruginosa in either medium produced enterotoxin only when the S. aureus inoculum was much greater than the P. aeruginosa inoculum (10 versus 10(3) or 10(4) CFU). It can be concluded from these results that enterotoxin production is unlikely in mixed cultures unless the staphylococci outnumber the other contaminating organisms.
TI  - The diagnosis and management of urinary tract infection in children: a two year study in army general practice.
AB  - A study of possible new cases of urinary tract infection in a population of some  two thousand children under the age of twelve years is described. Over a two year period one hundred and four children were seen in the study and seventeen were found to have a significant bacterial infection. Presenting symptoms, urinalysis results, investigation and methods of follow-up are examined. The results suggest that the incidence of detectable urinary system abnormality in children presenting for the first time with a proven urinary infection is less than in a comparable hospital population. In this study, of the seventeen children with proven infection, only four have so far been shown to have a detectable structural or functional abnormality.

AB  - The survival and the interactions of selected, hygienically relevant bacterial species in activated carbon filters was investigated. The numbers of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and P. putida increased in previously sterilized filters. After inoculation all bacteria (10(6] were adsorbed. During a period of 6-10 days the filter effluent contained no detectable bacteria. After that the colony numbers increased to a constant level of 10(4)-10(5) colony forming units (CFU)/ml effluent and 10(6)-10(7) CFU/g activated carbon. Klebsiella pneumoniae and Streptococcus faecalis died off in the filter system. If the filters were inoculated simultaneously with two species, P. putida and P. aeruginosa remained at a constant level between 10(4) and 10(5) CFU/ml. E. coli was suppressed by P. aeruginosa and died off in the presence of P. putida. As in-vitro tests indicated, P. putida did not produce inhibitory substances against P. aeruginosa or E. coli. On the other hand, P. aeruginosa showed antagonistic activities against E. coli.
TI  - [Occurrence and incidence of bacteria in the area of drinking water with antagonistic relations to indicator bacteria].
AB  - During a period of 8 months about 3000 drinking water samples derived from different water works and distribution systems around the area of the city Bonn were examined for colony count, E. coli and coliform bacteria and bacteria suppressing the growth of E. coli and S. faecalis. A modified agar diffusion test was used for the determination of antagonistic substances. Bacteria which revealed an antagonistic activity were isolated and identified. The majority of water samples (81.9% of the samples examined for antagonistic bacteria against E. coli) contained no bacteria in 1 ml and therefore were not examined for antagonistic substances. Only 2.5% of the samples had bacterial counts greater 100 per ml. In 64.2% of the samples examined for bacteria antagonistic to S. faecalis, no counts were found and 2.4% had counts greater 100. The occurrence of fecal indicators was very low in samples with low colony forming units (cfu). At counts greater than 100 we found E. coli within 30.6% and coliform bacteria in 38.8% of the samples examined for bacteria showing antagonistic activity against E. coli. E. coli and coliform bacteria were determined in 24.2% and 33.3% of the samples examined for antagonistic bacteria against S. faecalis. 20% of the samples with colony counts between 1 to 10 contained bacteria showing antagonistic activity against E. coli and at counts greater than 100 they were found in 57.1% of the samples. On the other hand, the quantity of samples with suppression of S. faecalis was 10 to 20% lower and reached a maximum of 39.4% at cfu greater 100. Most of the isolated antagonistic strains belong to the genus Pseudomonas and even 57.8% of the inhibitory strains against E. coli and 26.5% against S. faecalis were found to be P. fluorescens.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence of the ends of the conjugative shuttle transposon Tn1545.
AB  - The conjugative shuttle transposon Tn1545 from Streptococcus pneumoniae transposes in various gram-positive bacterial genera following self-transfer and in Escherichia coli after cloning. Analysis of the junction fragments and of the targets before insertion and after excision of the element by DNA hybridization and sequencing indicated that Tn1545 (1) is not flanked by terminal repeated sequences in either direct or opposite orientation, (2) is flanked, in an asymmetric fashion, by terminal variable base pairs, one at the left and three at the right of the element, (3) inserts in a target DNA consensus sequence, (4) does not generate duplication of the target DNA upon insertion, and (5) excises precisely.
TI  - Penetration of bacteria and spermatozoa into bovine cervical mucus.
AB  - It has been reported that bacteria may attach to motile spermatozoa, be carried through the cervix and uterus to the fallopian tubes, and cause acute salpingitis. In an attempt to mimic these conditions in vitro, we incubated Escherichia coli, Streptococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus with motile spermatozoa which then were allowed to migrate through a capillary filled with bovine cervical mucus. After satisfactory sperm migration through the mucus, the capillaries were broken and cultured at different distances from the original insemination site. Mucus fractions in proximity to bacterial inocula grew varying amounts of the pathogens. More distal fractions of mucus columns were generally culture-negative even though they contained motile sperm which had been exposed to bacteria. Migration of spermatozoa exposed to bacteria through bovine cervical mucus did not result in enhanced bacterial penetration.

TI  - Comparative survival of antibiotic-resistant and -sensitive fecal indicator bacteria in estuarine water.
AB  - The survival of antibiotic-resistant and -sensitive strains of Escherichia coli,  Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus equinus, and two environmental isolates, AP17 and AQ62, was examined in estuarine water. Each strain was rendered resistant to a combination of two antibiotics by serial passage in increasing concentrations of antibiotics. Cultures were incubated in filter-sterilized estuarine water for up to 7 days. Recovery was assessed by examining colony-forming ability on media with and without antibiotics. None of the antibiotic-resistant forms survived longer than its antibiotic-sensitive counterpart in estuarine water. Three of the resistant strains died off more rapidly than the antibiotic-sensitive wild type. Survival of the test bacteria in estuarine water was as follows: sensitive and resistant AQ62, resistant Escherichia coli less than sensitive Escherichia coli less than resistant AP17 less than resistant Enterococcus faecium less than sensitive AP17, sensitive and resistant S. equinus less than sensitive and resistant Enterococcus faecalis, sensitive Enterococcus faecium. The results supported the suggestion that fecal entercocci may serve as better indicators of fecal pollution than Escherichia coli in marine ecosystems. Moreover, the results indicated that the use of antibiotic-resistant mutants to follow the fate of bacteria in the environment is inappropriate without adequate studies to ensure that resistant and wild-type strains react similarly to environmental stressors.
TI  - Cloning of the K+-ATPase of Streptococcus faecalis. Structural and evolutionary implications of its homology to the KdpB-protein of Escherichia coli.
AB  - The K+-ATPase of Streptococcus faecalis consists of a single polypeptide component of relative Mr = 78,000 and serves as an ATP-driven pump for the accumulation of potassium by the bacterial cell. The gene encoding this ATPase was isolated by immunological screening of an S. faecalis genomic library in the Escherichia coli/pUC8 host/vector system. Two independently derived clones express the full-size ATPase polypeptide. Transcription and translation of the cloned DNA apparently proceed by means of the respective S. faecalis signals. DNA sequencing revealed a gene encoding a protein of 583 amino acids and a calculated Mr of 63,070. This protein exhibits in its primary structure regions of homology with the KdpB-subunit of the K+-ATPase of E. coli and, to a lesser extent, with eukaryotic ion-motive ATPases. The hydropathy profiles and secondary structure predictions, respectively, for the S. faecalis ATPase and the E. coli KdpB-protein show striking similarity. Even regions with low homology in the amino acid sequence exhibit structural features that have clearly been conserved in the two proteins. This points to a fundamental role of these domains in the structure and/or function of these transport ATPases.

AB  - Loperamide has been recently indicated in the management of infants with severe protracted diarrhea. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of loperamide on fecal flora in severe protracted diarrheas. 19 children aged 1 to 36 months, with severe protracted diarrhea were studied: 14 received loperamide (0.5 mg/kg/d) and 5 were without loperamide treatment. Criteria analysed were: clinical tolerance (vomiting and abdominal distention); efficacy (number of stools, transit time and Na+/K+ in stools) and effect on fecal flora, with differential qualitative and quantitative analysis method (complete identification and counts of aerobic and strict anaerobic bacteria in fresh fecal samples before and 4 to 8 days after the beginning of loperamide). Parenteral and/or oral alimentation remain constant during the study. Results show a rapid (24 h) efficacy in 9/14. Although important changes in specific fecal flora counts was noticed for streptococcus D and Proteus as compared to five controls, no bacterial overgrowth appeared or was increased during loperamide treatment.
TI  - Generation of Tn5 insertions in streptococcal conjugative transposon Tn916.
AB  - A method has been developed for the introduction of Tn5 into Escherichia coli plasmid chimeras containing Streptococcus faecalis DNA. Tn5 could be introduced via a lambda::Tn5 delivery vehicle. The system proved to be particularly efficient and facilitated insertions at numerous sites on DNA containing the 16-kilobase conjugative transposon Tn916. It was possible to introduce some of the resulting Tn916::Tn5 derivatives back into S. faecalis by using a recently developed protoplast transformation procedure. A presumed zygotic induction resulted in insertion of the Tn916 derivatives at multiple sites in the S. faecalis chromosome.
TI  - Effect of infection with Eimeria tenella upon the cecal bacterial population in monoflora chickens.
AB  - Monoflora chickens were established at 2 days of age by an oral inoculation with  one of six species of bacteria (Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bifidobacterium thermophilum, Bacteroides vulgatus, Clostridium perfringens, Escherichia coli, or Streptococcus faecalis) and were infected with Eimeria tenella (5 X 10(4) oocysts per bird) 2 days later. There were two experimental groups for each bacterium: birds infected with bacteria alone and birds infected with a combination of bacteria and E. tenella. Seven days after E. tenella infection, counts of B. thermophilum in the cecal contents were significantly lower for E. tenella-infected birds than for those infected by B. thermophilum alone, whereas 10 days after E. tenella infection, counts were higher for E. tennella-infected birds. The population of L. acidophilus in the cecal contents of the E. tenella-infected chickens 10 days after inoculation was significantly greater than that in uninfected chickens. No significant differences were observed between the numbers of B. vulgatus, C. perfringens, and S. faecalis in cecal contents of groups with and without E. tenella infections.
TI  - [Recent trend of childhood bacterial meningitis in Japan (1979-1984). Part 4. A classification of prognosis and antibiotic treatment based on causative agents].
AB  - Nine hundred seventy cases of childhood bacterial meningitis treated at 107 institutions in Japan from 1979 through 1984 were studied using questionnaire. The number of cases that underwent antimicrobial monotherapy remained nearly constant during the study period, but cases of therapies with beta-lactam combined with aminoglycosides (AGs) decreased in number and a gradual increase in the use of beta-lactam combined with non-AGs antibiotics including beta-lactam (Non AGs) was observed. A trend showing decrease in case fatality rate (CFR) was observed except that CFR for Gram-positive bacterial infections treated with beta-lactam + AGs remained at a same level. Cases treated with antibiotics were classified into 3 groups according to major etiological pathogens. Cases with Staphylococcus aureus gave a poor prognosis, among 27 total cases, CFR was 28.6% (2/7) with monotherapy, 50.0% (6/12) with beta-lactam + AGs and 37.5% (3/8) with beta-lactam + Non AGs (P less than 0.1). Among 100 cases of group B Streptococcus (GBS), CFR was 20.0% as a whole, 17.3% (9/52) for monotherapy and 34.5% (10/29) for beta-lactam + AGs (P less than 0.1). Among 198 cases of Streptococcus pneumoniae, CFR was 12.1% as a whole, and was 12.3% (18/146) with monotherapy. CFR for the cases treated with beta-lactam + AGs was 20.8% (5/24) and with beta-lactam + Non AGs was 3.6% (1/28) (P less than 0.1). CFR for 292 cases of Haemophilus influenzae meningitis was fairly low, and was 6.1% (9/148) with monotherapy, 7.4% (5/68) with beta-lactam + AGs and 3.9% (3/76) with beta-lactam + Non AGs, thus very slight differences were observed among the 3 groups of treatment. Among 111 cases of Escherichia coli, monotherapy and beta-lactam + Non AGs gave 6.5% (2/31) CFR, and 5.6% (1/18) CFR, respectively, whereas beta-lactam + AGs showed CFR of 19.4% (12/62), demonstrating a significant difference tendency (P less than 0.1). Similar tendencies were observed in the cases of Listeria monocytogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus faecalis. Contrary to the high CFR observed with the beta-lactam + AGs treatment, significantly low CFR was frequently obtained in cases treated with a combination of penicillins with cephalosporins including latamoxef or beta-lactam with chloramphenicol. Infections with GBS, E. coli, and P. mirabilis occurred largely in the age between 0 to 6 months and CFR was especially high in the very young.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Therapeutic effects of imipenem-cilastatin on experimental intrauterine infections in rats.
AB  - The therapeutic effects of imipenem-cilastatin (MK-0787-MK-791) on experimental intrauterine infections in progesterone-treated virgin rats and postpartum rats were studied. The relative efficacy of imipenem-cilastatin for the treatment of such intrauterine infections was compared with that of cefazolin and ampicillin for the treatment of infections caused by Escherichia coli and Streptococcus faecalis, respectively. Treatment with imipenem-cilastatin significantly inhibited the proliferation of E. coli and S. faecalis in uteri, as compared with the proliferation in untreated controls. Cefazolin failed to affect the E. coli infection. With the S. faecalis infection, ampicillin effectively reduced bacterial growth, as compared with that in untreated controls. However, ampicillin was inferior to and comparable to imipenem-cilastatin in progesterone-treated virgin rats and postpartum rats, respectively. A further experiment with S. faecalis infections in rats made neutropenic by intraperitoneal injection of cyclophosphamide showed that the therapeutic effectiveness of imipenem-cilastatin was superior to that of ampicillin and was not influenced by neutropenia. Our results suggest that imipenem-cilastatin may be a useful agent for the treatment of obstetric and gynecologic infections.

TI  - [Evaluation of cefuzonam in the pediatric field].
AB  - Cefuzonam (L-105, CZON) was studied in pediatric infections. A summary of the results it as follows: For recently isolated Staphylococcus aureus strains, Peak MICs of CZON were distributed between 0.39 and 0.78 micrograms/ml showing a greater susceptibility of S. aureus to CZON than to cefoperazone (CPZ), latamoxef (LMOX), and cefmenoxime (CMX). Peak MICs of CZON for Escherichia coli were 0.10-0.20 micrograms/ml, similar to those of CPZ, LMOX, and CMX. Ampicillin (ABPC)-resistant strains were also susceptible to CZON. MICs for Salmonella were similar to those for E. coli. Peak MICs of CZON for Vibrio parahaemolyticus were 0.20-0.39 micrograms/ml. The susceptibility of the bacteria to CZON was far greater than to ABPC, and was similar to CPZ, LMOX, and CMX. With 20 mg/kg drip infusion, serum concentrations reached their peaks at the end of administration with values of 20.6-68.7 micrograms/ml, which decreased to 0.43-1.70 micrograms/ml after 2 hours. Half-lives of CZON in serum were 0.68-1.2 hours. With 50 mg/kg drip infusion, serum concentrations reached their peaks at the end of administration with levels of 69.0-82.0 micrograms/ml, and at after 2 hours 1.85-3.45 micrograms/ml. Thus, an apparent dose response was observed. Half-lives of CZON in serum were 0.63-0.99 hours. Urinary recovery rates in 6 hours were 39.9-80.5%. A total of 44 cases of 10 different types of acute pediatric infections was treated by CZON intravenous drip infusion as the main therapeutic procedure. The efficacy rate was 93.2%, and the compound was effective on purulent infections, acute urinary tract infection, etc. with pathogens such as ABPC-resistant S. aureus, E. coli, and Enterococcus faecalis. Dosage levels per day were 50 to 80 mg/kg in most cases. In infections with S. aureus (8 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (3 strains), E. faecalis (1 strain), Haemophilus parahaemolyticus (1 strain), Haemophilus parainfluenzae (2 strains), Haemophilus influenzae (11 strains), Bordetella pertussis (1 strain), E. coli (3 strains), a total of 30 strains, bacterial elimination was noted with an exception of 1 strain of S. aureus. The compound was used for 4 to 15 days, but side effects observed clinically were only 1 case of diarrhea and 1 case of thrombocytosis.
TI  - Human choriogonadotropin-like material in bacteria of different species: electron microscopy and immunocytochemical studies with monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies.
AB  - Immunocytochemical studies using antisera to whole human choriogonadotropin (hCG), to its alpha- and beta-subunits and to the COOH-terminal peptide of hCG beta, and two monoclonal antibodies to hCG beta, demonstrated expression of hCG-like material, its individual subunits and/or fragments in nine bacterial strains. Seven of these were isolated from patients with cancer and were definitely identified as Streptococcus faecalis (three strains), Staphylococcus haemolyticus (two strains) and Staphylococcus epidermidis and Escherichia coli (single strains). The other two strains were cell-wall-deficient (CWD) variants, one identified as Streptococcus bovis, isolated from the blood of a patient with a fever of unknown origin and a possible brain abscess. The other was a Gram-negative diphtheroid isolated from the urine of a pregnant woman, which during the period of study reverted to a Gram-positive Corynebacterium identified as a 'C. ulcerans' strain and expressed the hCG-like factor only during its phase as Gram-negative diphtheroid. Electron microscopy of these nine strains (including negative controls of strains of the same species subjected to the same immunocytochemical analyses and under identical cultural conditions) revealed morphological alterations in the bacterial cell walls and cytoplasmic material and/or bizarre forms of reproduction in six of the nine strains expressing hCG-like material including the two CWD variants. Collectively, these results provided evidence that (1) hCG-producing bacteria isolated from patients with overt cancer are not a new and unique species as claimed by others, and (2) there is a close resemblance between the bacterial protein and the human trophoblastic hormone, based on immunochemical recognition of different parts of the hCG molecule.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Simultaneous determination of carbohydrates and products of carbohydrate metabolism in fermentation mixtures by HPLC.
AB  - An improved procedure for separating and quantitating carbohydrates, alcohols, and organic acids in fermentation mixtures metabolized by intestinal microflora is described. The high-pressure liquid chromatographic method is efficient, reproducible, and sensitive. A column packed with cation-exchange resin in the hydrogen form, eluted isocratically with 0.028 M H2SO4 at 40 degrees C separates the compounds of interest. The eluate is monitored with ultraviolet and refractive index detectors in series. On-line acquistion and storage of detector output by a computer allows post-analysis data manipulation and quantitation. Using this method, the metabolic profiles for the fermentation of glucose, fructose, lactose, and sucrose by several intestinal microorganisms are characterized and compared.
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of cefuzonam in children].
AB  - Cefuzonam (L-105, CZON), a new parenteral cephalosporin, was evaluated for its efficacy and safety in 22 children with bacterial infections (Table 1). The results obtained are summarized below. MICs of CZON to 26 strains of isolated organisms are shown in Table 2. MICs to all 14 strains of Haemophilus influenzae and 6 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae were less than 0.05 microgram/ml. The MIC to 2 strains of Staphylococcus aureus was 0.39 microgram/ml and that to another was 0.78 microgram/ml. Two strains of Escherichia coli showed MICs of less than 0.05 and 0.10 microgram/ml, respectively. The MIC to 1 strain of Enterococcus faecalis was 6.25 micrograms/ml. The CZON was administered in 3 or 4 divided doses at a daily dosage ranging from 58.5 to 85.7 mg/kg by 30-minute drip infusion or intravenous injection to 22 patients (9 cases of pneumonia, 9 cases of tonsillitis, 2 cases of bronchitis, 1 case each of suppurative parotitis and acute pyelonephritis) and the following clinical results were obtained; excellent: 12 cases; good: 7 cases; fair: 3 cases. The overall efficacy rate was 86% (Table 4). Diarrhea was observed in four patients, and was resolved with or without discontinuation of the medication within a week. Anemia was noted in 2 cases. Leucopenia and neutropenia was observed in 1 case. There were a moderate rises in S-GOT and S-GPT activities in 1 patient (Table 4), and they necessitated the cessation of the CZON therapy. The S-GOT and S-GPT activities became normal after the drug treatment was stopped.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach for estimating effective administrative dose of ceftizoxime. Observation from MIC and ceftizoxime disc susceptibility test].
AB  - In vitro activities of ceftizoxime (CZX) against 328 clinical isolates were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) cfu/ml. CZX was highly active against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Proteus vulgaris with MIC values below 0.20 microgram/ml. It was also active against Serratia marcescens and Enterobacter aerogenes with MIC85 of 3.13 micrograms/ml. CZX was less active against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, showing inhibitory activities against only 47 and 78% of these clinical isolates, respectively, at a dose level of 12.5 micrograms/ml. CZX was not active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus faecalis. The reliability of CZX disc diffusion susceptibility tests for quantitative estimation of antimicrobial activities was also investigated using 8 mm diameter discs (Showa) and 6 mm diameter discs (Eiken), both of which contained 30 micrograms/disc of CZX. These disc susceptibility test results were well correlated with MICs, hence the CZX disc susceptibility test should be useful for the estimation of proper dose levels of CZX, except against P. aeruginosa and E. faecalis. For the interpretation of CZX disc tests, a 3 category system has been used in USA and Europe, but a 4 category system is generally used in Japan. The 3 category system uses break points to classify bacteria into 3 categories of susceptibility according to MIC values as follows: resistant (R) MIC greater than 32 micrograms/ml, moderately susceptible (MS) MIC 16-32 micrograms/ml, and susceptible (S) MIC less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [Treatment of urinary tract infections with SolcoUrovac].
AB  - Urinary tract infections are among the most common infections found in women. If  recurrences or reinfections become frequent treatment can be problematic. Immunisation of the patients by vaccinating them against urinary tract pathogens offers a possibility of managing these infections. In clinical trials we tested SolcoUrovac, a new vaccine to counteract bacterial pathogens, with regard to efficacy, frequency of recurrence, and tolerance. 113 of the 118 patients included in this study with bacteriuria (urine culture germ count greater than or equal to 10(5)/ml), had acute cystitis. 47 of these patients had recurring urinary tract infections. Follow-up examinations were conducted after 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 12 months. A urine culture assay was performed during each examination, as well as a relevant bacterial differentiation test and a urine sediment evaluation. Two to six weeks after termination of the vaccination series 72.6% of the patients were largely free from signs and symptoms. The rate of recurrence/reinfection dropped from 2.5 to 0.24 infections for a period of 12 months. After one year, 94 of the patients (80%) were still free from reinfection.

TI  - Filterability of L-forms.
AB  - We investigated the recovery of L-forms through micropore filtration. The findings indicate that L-form recovery and viability are a function of filter size and preparation technique. Current methods in use for L-form isolation appear to give erroneously low results, underestimating the potential role of L-forms in human disease.

TI  - Preliminary experience with ceftazidime monotherapy in perinatal infection.
AB  - Ceftazidime, a new cephalosporin antibiotic, was used as monotherapy to treat 75  term neonates with suspected perinatal bacterial infection. Septicemia was documented in ten patients (13%). Ceftazidime was administered as 25 mg/kg doses intravenously every 12 h. Peak serum concentrations at 0.5 h after dose ranged from 57 to 115 micrograms/ml and trough serum concentrations prior to next dose from 2 to 15 micrograms/ml. The overall clinical, bacteriological and laboratory response to ceftazidime was satisfactory and the drug was well tolerated. However, reservations with regard to study design, limited gram-positive drug activity and potential emergence of drug resistance require further well-controlled clinical evaluations of ceftazidime in neonatal intensive care units, before definite recommendations for the use of this antibiotic in perinatal infection can be formulated.
TI  - [In vitro studies on microbial incorporation of nitrogen from [15N2] urea and [15N]ammonium chloride by human intestinal flora].
AB  - 6 typical bacteria species of the human intestinal flora (E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Streptococcus faecalis, Bacteroides fragilis, Bifidobacterium sp.) were incubated in a liquid medium for 48 h with [15N2]-urea and [15N]-ammonium chloride. The rates of [15N]-incorporation were calculated. They depend reproducible on the species examined, on the kind of the offered NPN-substance and on the amount of NPN-substance in the medium. With [15N2]-urea the minimal rate of incorporation was 3.8% (E coli) and the maximal one 95.6% (Bifidobacterium sp.). With [15N]-ammonium chloride the corresponding figures were 31.0 (Proteus vulg.) and 98.0% (Bifidobacterium sp.). The findings are discussed with regard to a possible enteral detoxification in uremic patients by bacterial utilization and elimination of urea and ammonia.
TI  - Experimentally induced Bacteroides infections in the rabbit.
AB  - Rabbits were infected with Bacteroides fragilis, B. macacae and B. gingivalis in  monoinfection, mixed Bacteroides infection, and mixed infection of B. gingivalis with Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli and Clostridium sporogenes. Monoinfection gave rise to localised, nodular abscesses at cell levels greater than 0.5 X 10(5) cfu ml-1, the severity of which was dose related. Mixed infections including B. gingivalis caused severe spreading lesions and affected organs distant from the injection site. Histopathological studies indicate an inflammatory response with gas vacuolation and local necrosis.
TI  - The effect of transferrin and lysozyme on antibacterial activity of amniotic fluid.
AB  - Amniotic fluid obtained from normal full term gestation inhibited the growth of E. coli, Staph. aureus and B. subtilis, while Ps. aeruginosa, Str. faecalis and Str. agalactiae proliferated readily in amniotic fluid. But when amniotic fluid was heated at 100 degrees C for 5 minutes, its antibacterial activity was completely lost. The levels of transferrin and lysozyme in amniotic fluid at term were determined to be 29.1 +/- 17.6 mg/100 ml (n = 90) and 19.1 +/- 8.3 micrograms/ml (n = 145), respectively. Antibacterial activity against E. coli was restored by adding transferrin into heat-treated amniotic fluid at a concentration of 250 mg/100 ml or higher, but simultaneous addition of transferrin and sufficient concentration of iron to form a transferrin-iron complex resulted in the loss of antibacterial activities. When lysozyme was added to the amniotic fluid, which had lost its antibacterial activity through exposure to heat, the antibacterial effect on B. subtilis was restored. The growth of Staph. aureus in heat-treated amniotic fluid was inhibited by the concomitant addition of lysozyme and aminobenzyl penicillin.

TI  - Analysis of microcalorimetric curves for bacterial identification.
AB  - A numeric method is suggested for the treatment of microcalorimetric curves of bacterial growth to provide a new tool for their automatic identification. In this method the microcalorimetric curves are searched against certain reference profiles (stored in a library) by means of a cross-correlation analysis and a parametric comparison. The matching between the new curve and each reference profile is evaluated by means of a specific identification coefficient which provides an objective criterion for the identification of each species. The reliability of the method is discussed.
TI  - Quality control limits for microdilution susceptibility tests with norfloxacin.
AB  - A multilaboratory study was designed to define quality control limits for microdilution susceptibility tests with norfloxacin. The following limits were proposed: for Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, 0.03 to 0.125 micrograms/ml; for Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, 1.0 to 4.0 micrograms/ml; for Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213, 0.5 to 2.0 micrograms/ml; and for Streptococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, 2.0 to 8.0 micrograms/ml. The latter represents a change in the previously recommended control limits.

TI  - Comparison of two beta-lactamase-producing strains of Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - A second strain of enterococcus (PA) producing beta-lactamase (Bla+ phenotype) was compared with the previously reported Bla+ enterococcus, strain HH22. As with the original strain, there was a marked inoculum effect when PA was tested with penicillin, ampicillin, and piperacillin; no difference was noted with methicillin, cephalothin, imipenem, or vancomycin; the difference with ticarcillin was intermediate. High-level gentamicin resistance (Gmr) transferred from PA to an enterococcal recipient strain at a frequency approximately 100-fold lower than for HH22; all Gmr transconjugants from both strains were Bla+, but only PA showed linkage of Gmr and Bla+ with transfer of resistance to streptomycin, tetracycline, and chloramphenicol. EcoRI digestion of plasmid DNA from Gmr Bla+ transconjugants showed no similarities between the two strains. A 5.1-kilobase EcoRI Bla+-encoding fragment derived from HH22 was cloned into an Escherichia coli cloning vector and shown to hybridize to a 10.2-kilobase EcoRI fragment derived from PA; both fragments hybridized to an 840-base-pair staphylococcal Bla+ gene probe. These data indicate that the penicillinases are similar but encoded on different or differently arranged plasmids. The fact that both are transferable emphasizes the potential for this new streptococcal resistance determinant to disseminate.
TI  - Reconstitution of ATP-dependent calcium transport from streptococci.
AB  - Membrane vesicles of three streptococcal strains (Streptococcus faecalis, Streptococcus lactis, and Streptococcus sanguis) were extracted with octyl-beta-D-glucoside in the presence of Escherichia coli lipid and glycerol. For reconstitution, the detergent extract was mixed with bath-sonicated E. coli lipid, in the presence of octyl-beta-D-glucoside, and proteoliposomes were formed by a 25-fold dilution. ATP-dependent calcium accumulation by proteoliposomes was comparable to that found in parent vesicles. Recovery of this calcium transport activity was dependent on the inclusion of an osmolyte protein stabilant (glycerol, etc.) during solubilization. The properties of ATP-driven calcium transport were studied in the reconstituted system. In proteoliposomes, ATP-linked calcium accumulation was not affected by the protonophore, carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone, or by the ionophores, valinomycin and nigericin, in the presence of potassium, or by N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, an inhibitor of the F0F1-ATPase. On the other hand, calcium transport was completely blocked by micromolar levels of orthovanadate; half-maximal inhibitions were observed at 0.4, 4, and 4 microM vanadate, for S. faecalis, S. lactis, and S. sanguis, respectively. This marked sensitivity to orthovanadate suggests operation of an E1E2-type ion-motive pump. These data demonstrate that, in a reconstituted system, calcium transport is not linked to an ATP-dependent proton circulation via the F0F1-ATPase, but rather is driven by a calcium-translocating ATPase. Thus, calcium extrusion from the cytosol of enteric, lactic acid, or oral streptococci is mediated by an ATP-linked process analogous to the ion-motive ATPases of eukaryotic membranes.
TI  - Dispersal of a plasmid-borne chloramphenicol resistance gene in streptococcal and enterococcal plasmids.
AB  - Plasmids coding for chloramphenicol resistance, five isolated from streptococci of groups A, B, and G, ten from enterococci (Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium), and two from staphylococci, were tested for sequence homology with the chloramphenicol resistance gene of pIP501, a 30-kb plasmid originally isolated from a group B Streptococcus. The 6.3-kb HindIII fragment of pIP501, known to carry the chloramphenicol resistance gene, was cloned into pBR322. A 1.6-kb portion of the cloned fragment, which included most of the chloramphenicol resistance gene, was used as probe in DNA-DNA hybridization experiments. Sequence homology was detected between the probe and four of the streptococcal, seven of the enterococcal, and one of the staphylococcal plasmids. The absence of hybridization between this probe and one plasmid isolated from a group B Streptococcus, as well as three isolated from E. faecalis, indicated that there are at least two different plasmid-borne chloramphenicol resistance determinants in the streptococci and in the enterococci.
TI  - ATP-driven calcium transport in membrane vesicles of Streptococcus sanguis.
AB  - Calcium transport was investigated in membrane vesicles prepared from the oral bacterium Streptococcus sanguis. Procedures were devised for the preparation of membrane vesicles capable of accumulating 45Ca2+. Uptake was ATP dependent and did not require a proton motive force. Calcium transport in these vesicles was compared with 45Ca2+ accumulation in membrane vesicles from Streptococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli. The data support the existence of an ATP-driven calcium pump in S. sanguis similar to that in S. faecalis. This pump, which catalyzes uptake into membrane vesicles, would be responsible for extrusion of calcium from intact cells.
TI  - Characterization and partial purification of a broad spectrum antibiotic AS-48 produced by Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - Streptococcus faecalis S-48 produces a broad spectrum antibiotic, active against  Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. This substance is produced in solid and liquid media and also in a defined basal medium. It is sensitive to protease, pronase, or trypsin, heating at 70 degrees C, and alkaline pH, but resistant to treatment with lipase, lysozyme, alkaline phosphatase, DNAase, RNAase, acidic or neutral pHs, and also lower temperatures (60 degrees C). Several organic solvents cause precipitation, but not inactivation. This antibiotic has been partially purified by gel filtration and further ion-exchange chromatography. Its molecular weight has been estimated close to 2000. The biological activity of this antagonistic substance against the selected indicator strains, Streptococcus faecalis S-47 and Escherichia coli U-9, is bactericidal. The characterization of this substance, initially classified as a bacteriocin, indicates that it is an antibiotic of peptidic nature. The significance of antibiotic occurrence in group D of the genus Streptococcus is also discussed.

TI  - [A clinical evaluation of MK-0787/MK-0791 for long-term administration in urological infections].
AB  - MK-0787 (Imipenem)/MK-0791 (Cilastatin sodium), a new compound of Thienamycin, was administered in treatment of 35 patients (36 cases) with chronic complicated UTI or for prevention of serious infections with much complicated factors. The patients were principally treated at a daily dose of 1 g for over 10 days. The efficacy rate of 26 patients who were evaluable in the early phase (4-7 days) was 88.5%, while it became up to 92.3% in the final phase judgment. As for clinical usefulness, the result was obtained to be as high as that of the clinical efficacy. In bacteriological study, 35 strains were clinically isolated including 7 strains of P. aeruginosa from UTI. All the strains disappeared with an eradication rate of 100% after treatment. Strains appearing after Imipenem/Cilastatin sodium treatment mainly consisted of fungi. Usefulness judgements tended to be greater in the final phase than in the early phase. As for side effects, vomiting was recorded in one case, in which the administration was discontinued. In laboratory findings there were 3 cases with elevated GPT, 2 cases with elevated GOT, one case with elevated gamma-GTP, one with thrombocytopenia, and one with eosinophilia each, but these abnormal values were slight and transient. In summary our clinical study showed that Imipenem/Cilastatin sodium was a very effective antibiotic in treatment on moderate or serious UTI or preventive use for infections in compromised hosts. Considering the features of this agent, it might be more effective and useful for clinical use in treatment on polymicrobial infections including stubborn organisms than any other antimicrobial compounds. Furthermore, it was safe and well tolerable in a long term treatment.
TI  - [Clinical trial of HAPA-B in complicated urinary tract infections].
AB  - HAPA-B was administered intramuscularly to 20 patients with complicated urinary tract infections to evaluate its clinical effects and safety in conformity with the estimations of efficacy of antimicrobial agents standardized by the UTI Committee. The overall clinical efficacy was excellent in 5 patients, moderate in 8 patients and poor in 7 patients. The effectiveness rate was 65.0%. Overall clinical efficacy as classified by type of infection was 66.7% in 12 patients with a single infection, and 62.5% in 8 patients with mixed infection. Bacteriological studies showed that 29 of the 34 strains isolated from the urine of the 20 patients were completely eradicated, and that the bacteriological response was 85.3%. The following side effects were detected in both blood chemistry checks and clinical symptoms. Peripheral blood examinations showed an increase in eosinophil level in one patient. Kidney function tests revealed a slight elevation of s-creatinine in this patient, too. In another patient, eruptions developed on his body on the 2nd day, but it was not necessary to discontinue the administration of HAPA-B.
TI  - Effect of organotins on fecal pollution indicator organisms.
AB  - Pure cultures of Escherichia coli and Streptococcus faecalis and environmental water samples were examined for the possibility that pollution involving organotin compounds could decrease the values for indicator organisms when standard methods were applied to the analysis of water samples. (CH3)2SnCl2 and (CH3)3SnCl decreased viable counts at about 10 to 100 mg of Sn liter-1 (8.4 X 10(-5) to 8.4 X 10(-4) mol of Sn liter-1), and tributyltin chloride was effective at about 0.1 to 1.0 mg of Sn liter-1 (8.4 X 10(-7) to 8.4 X 10(-6) mol of Sn liter-1. These concentrations, particularly for the methyltin compounds, are greater than the concentrations reported to date for these compounds in aquatic ecosystems. Thus, organotin compounds alone would not be likely to cause reductions in counts of indicator organisms measured by standard methods. However, it is suggested that, when combined with other environmental stressors or upon long exposure, organotins such as butyltins may contribute to the injury of indicator organisms.
TI  - Intermittent hyperbaric oxygen therapy for reduction of mortality in experimental polymicrobial sepsis.
AB  - Hyperbaric oxygen therapy has a marked beneficial effect in experimental intraabdominal sepsis. Two rat models involving implantation of either rat fecal material or a mixture of pure cultures of Escherichia coli, Streptococcus faecalis, and Bacteroides fragilis were used in this study. A death rate of 100% was obtained in control animals implanted with fecal material; with intermittent hyperbaric oxygen treatment, a death rate of only 8% was observed (P less than .005). With a mixture of pure cultures of clinical pathogens, the death rate in control animals was 79%, and intermittent hyperbaric oxygen treatment reduced the rate to 23% (P less than .005). Data from cultures of blood indicated that the efficacy of hyperbaric oxygen was not related to antibacterial activity.
TI  - Potent antagonism of Escherichia coli, Bacteroides ovatus, Fusobacterium varium,  and Enterococcus faecalis, alone or in combination, for enteropathogens in anaerobic continuous flow cultures.
AB  - Interactions between representative strains of four predominant resident bacteria of the human colon, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacteroides ovatus, and Fusobacterium varium, and strains of seven enteropathogens, Yersinia enterocolitica, Shigella flexneri, Salmonella typhimurium, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, V. cholerae serogroup non O1, Staphylococcus aureus, and Clostridium perfringens, were examined in studies with an anaerobic continuous flow culture system and medium resembling the content of the mouse caecum (MCM). Potent unilateral antagonism attributable to synergic activities of the resident bacteria against the enteropathogens was evident. The four resident bacteria persisted at levels of c. 10(6) cfu/ml or more in single and in any mixed cultures of the resident species. The seven enteropathogens also persisted in single cultures. In contrast, Y. enterocolitica was excluded in several days in mixed cultures with each of the four resident bacteria. Sh. Flexneri and Staph. aureus were excluded in the presence of E. coli alone. C. perfringens, V. parahaemolyticus and V. cholerae serogroup non O1 were excluded in the presence of E. coli with B. ovatus and, in some cases, with additional species. S. typhimurium was the most resistant; only c. 10(2)-fold reduction of the population level was observed in mixed culture with all four of the resident species. When the amounts of some components in the medium, such as peptone and yeast extract, were increased, C. perfringens grew and persisted even in the presence of the four resident bacteria. Sh. flexneri, in contrast decreased steadily, even in enriched media.
TI  - [Current status and the development of resistance of important urinary pathogens  to antibiotics in the Suhl district 1970-1984].
AB  - In a retrospective study over a period from 1970 to 1984 the distribution of frequency and the behaviour of the resistance of urine germs out of more than 43,000 sendings from outpatient and hospital institutions of the county of Suhl were analysed. In the period of observation the proportion of isolated E. coli redoubled and was nearly 68% in 1984. Conspicuous were a decrease of the isolates of Str. faecalis from 32 to 4% and an increase of problem germs of the Klebsiella group to 9.7%. The resistance situation is characterized by a distinct decrease of the resistance of E. coli in comparison to antimicrobial substances with smaller consumption (sulphonamides, chloramphenicol, nitrafurantoin) without homogeneous behaviour of the problem germs.
TI  - Sepsis and cholestasis: the in vitro effects of bacterial products on 14C-taurocholate uptake by isolated rat hepatocytes.
AB  - Bacterial endotoxins are known to be an important cause of cholestasis, yet not all organisms that cause cholestasis produce endotoxins. In order to determine whether bacterial products other than endotoxins may be involved in the cholestasis process, 14C-taurocholate (TC) uptake by isolated rat hepatocytes was measured in the presence of mid-log, stationary and mid-death phase bacterial broth supernatants from eight common bacterial pathogens. The results were then correlated with a quantitative assessment of endotoxin production by each organism. Supernatants from Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumonia demonstrated a striking inhibitory effect on bile salt uptake (77.2 +/- 6.7, 46.9 +/- 6.5 and 32.9 +/- 7.1% maximum inhibition of 14C-TC uptake, respectively) when compared to sterile broth controls. Streptococcus faecalis (Enterococcus), Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacteroides fragilis products, on the other hand, had relatively minor effects (12.3 +/- 5.2, 12.0 +/- 7.5, 8.4 +/- 6.7 and less than 5.0% inhibition respectively), while those from Proteus mirabilis had an intermediate effect (18.5 +/- 8.3% inhibition). Bile salt efflux rates (16.0 +/- 2.7 and 25.1 +/- 4.2 nmol/min/10(6) hepatocytes, mean +/- SEM) were similar in bacteria demonstrating marked uptake inhibition (Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) when compared to those with only minor inhibitory effects (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacteroides fragilis) (14.3 +/- 1.1 and 18.4 +/- 2.6 nmol/min/10(6) hepatocytes, respectively, p greater than 0.05). 14C-TC uptake inhibition did not correlate with the amount of endotoxin produced by each organism (r = 0.251). The results of this study indicate that bacteria produce a factor other than endotoxin that significantly inhibits bile salt uptake by isolated rat hepatocytes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [Influence of cefroxadine dry syrup on intestinal bacterial flora].
AB  - Influence of cefroxadine (CXD) dry syrup on intestinal bacterial flora was studied in mice infected with 4 species of bacteria, namely, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacteroides fragilis and Bifidobacterium breve, and in pediatric patients having infections in the respiratory tract and cutaneous/soft tissues. The results were summarized as follows: CXD dry syrup was administered for 5 consecutive days to mice infected with the 4 species. No considerable changes were observed in levels of bacteria in the feces and in different parts of digestive tracts. Eleven pediatric patients were orally administered with 30-54 mg/kg of CXD dry syrup a day for 7-15 consecutive days. Symptom of diarrhea was noted in 2 patients. Dominant species of the intestinal flora such as E. coli, Bifidobacterium, and Bacteroides sometimes decreased in patients treated with CXD dry syrup. In general, however, decreases in numbers of these bacteria were insignificant. Changes of intestinal flora in patients treated with CXD dry syrup were apparently smaller than those treated with ampicillin and were similar to those treated with cephalexin or amoxicillin.
TI  - An evaluation of various working practices in shops selling raw and cooked meats.
AB  - Three groups of premises (butchers' shops, supermarkets and general dealers) which sell raw and cooked meats were compared. Salmonellas were not detected, but Escherichia coli, and to a lesser degree Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis, were widely distributed in all three groups of premises. Contamination of hands, towels and nail brushes was related to poor working practices. The presence of E. coli or Str. faecalis on slicing machines was associated with contamination of meat samples. A number of wiping cloths were heavily contaminated with E. coli, and many also contained Clostridium perfringens. Fewer premises provided written cleaning plans, and in many cases staff did not receive an adequate training in food hygiene. The use of disinfectants as part of the cleaning process did not necessarily reduce the level of bacterial contamination. In general there was poor correlation between microbiological results and a visual inspection made by an environmental health officer. The possible reasons for this finding are discussed.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence analysis of the gene specifying the bifunctional 6'-aminoglycoside acetyltransferase 2"-aminoglycoside phosphotransferase enzyme in Streptococcus faecalis and identification and cloning of gene regions specifying the two activities.
AB  - The gene specifying the bifunctional 6'-aminoglycoside acetyltransferase [AAC(6')] 2"-aminoglycoside phosphotransferase [APH(2")] enzyme from the Streptococcus faecalis plasmid pIP800 was cloned in Escherichia coli. A single protein with an apparent molecular weight of 56,000 was specified by this cloned determinant as detected in minicell experiments. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed the presence of an open reading frame capable of specifying a protein of 479 amino acids and with a molecular weight of 56,850. The deduced amino acid sequence of the bifunctional AAC(6')-APH(2") gene product possessed two regions of homology with other sequenced resistance proteins. The N-terminal region contained a sequence that was homologous to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase of Bacillus pumilus, and the C-terminal region contained a sequence homologous to the aminoglycoside phosphotransferase of Streptomyces fradiae. Subcloning experiments were performed with the AAC(6')-APH(2") resistance determinant, and it was possible to obtain gene segments independently specifying the acetyltransferase and phosphotransferase activities. These data suggest that the gene specifying the AAC(6')-APH(2") resistance enzyme arose as a result of a gene fusion.
TI  - [Bactericidal and potent antiadhesive activity of sulbenicillin].
AB  - Sulbenicillin, a wide broad spectrum penicillin, is active against a lot of gram  positive and gram negative bacteria. The AA. studied the activity of this molecule against urinary infections causing germs, by evaluating two parameters: his antiadhesive capability and the Killing curves, in comparison with mezlocillin and piperacillin. An inhibition in adhesive capability of test-germs, due to sulbenicillin was obtained. Furthermore, resulting Killing curves showed more rapidity in action for sulbenicillin than for the two others molecules, versus resistant germs, like P. aeruginosa and S. faecalis.
TI  - Selection of a reference lot of Mueller-Hinton agar.
AB  - A collaborative study was undertaken to evaluate the performance of currently marketed Mueller-Hinton agars from seven manufacturers by replicate disk diffusion tests with standard quality control strains. Identification of the manufacturers was concealed, and the resulting data were evaluated for the selection of a physical reagent standard against which the performance of future production lots would be tested and made to conform. A medium was selected which was sufficiently close to existing National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards quality control limits that current interpretive criteria would require minimum modification. Two of the seven lots were eliminated from further consideration because the final pHs were outside acceptable limits. The remaining four lots had 96% of mean zone diameters less than or equal to 2 mm from those of the chosen lot and 65% of the means were less than or equal to 1 mm from those of the chosen lot for all 28 antimicrobial agent-organism combinations. Manufacturers then attempted to produce new lots of Mueller-Hinton agar which performed within the prescribed limits of the chosen lot. One lot performed in close conformity with the selected standard, but the overall performance of the media was essentially the same as that of the randomly chosen lots in the initial study. It was concluded that one of the original seven lots demonstrated properties which made it a tentative candidate for a physical reagent standard and that the use of a physical reagent standard in evaluating production lots might aid in stabilizing the performance of Mueller-Hinton agar.
TI  - [Clinical trials of imipenem/cilastatin sodium in the field of obstetrics and gynecology].
AB  - Many different infections including urinary tract infections occur in the field of obstetrics and gynecology. Furthermore, in most cases, it is practically impossible to clearly identify causative organisms as in cases of pelvic peritonitis and parametritis. In many incidents, causative organisms consist mainly of Escherichia coli, and recently, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacteroides fragilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, etc. have also been identified. Because the new antibiotic, imipenem/cilastatin sodium (MK-0787/MK-0791), is very effective against these bacteria, and because of its wide spectrum, we believe it is especially effective against infections of obstetrics and gynecology. The distribution of this antibiotic into various organs and tissues was similar to other drugs, and it reaches a high level in internal genital organs, hence it should be effective for the treatment of obstetric/gynecological infections. Its toxicity is low also, and no side effects nor abnormal laboratory findings were observed in our trials. Results of our trials are summarized below: Of 9 cases of obstetric/gynecological infections, the antibiotic showed excellent effectiveness against 2, good against 6, for the efficacy ratio of 89%. No side effects nor abnormal laboratory findings were observed.
TI  - Susceptibility testing with disc diffusion for new cephalosporins: pre-diffusion  revisited.
AB  - The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effect of 20-hour pre-diffusion, i.e. placing the antibiotic-containing discs on the agar for 20 hours prior to inoculation, as compared to direct diffusion, i.e. placing the discs on the agar immediately after inoculation, for the newer 3. generation cephalosporins as represented by ceftazidime and ceftriaxone. Regression lines (zone sizes vs. inhibitory concentrations, as measured by plate-dilution) were constructed for three groups of bacteria chosen because of their differences in growth characteristics on agar: E. coli (n = 50), Enterobacter sp. (n = 35), and streptococci (n = 51). The results for both cephalosporins were: 20-hour pre-diffusion produced larger zones than direct diffusion, regression studies for 20-hour pre-diffusion as compared to direct diffusion resulted in greater variation in zone sizes, numerically lower slopes, lower residual variances and higher correlation coefficients, and regression lines were significantly different for the 3 groups of bacteria with direct diffusion but not so with 20-hour pre-diffusion. Considering the interpretation of zone sizes with disc diffusion for the cephalosporins tested, 20-hour pre-diffusion was superior to direct diffusion.
TI  - Structure of a conjugative element in Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - We have cloned and mapped a 69-kilobase (kb) region of the chromosome of Streptococcus pneumoniae DP1322, which carries the conjugative omega (cat-tet) insertion from S. pneumoniae BM6001. This element proved to be 65.5 kb in size. Location of the junctions was facilitated by cloning a preferred target region from the wild-type strain Rx1 recipient genome. This target site was preferred by both the BM6001 element and the cat-erm-tet element from Streptococcus agalactiae B109. Within the BM6001 element cat and tet were separated by 30 kb, and cat was flanked by two copies of a sequence that was also present in the recipient strain Rx1 DNA. Another sequence at least 2.4 kb in size was found inside the BM6001 element and at two places in the Rx1 genome. Its role is unknown. The ends of the BM6001 element appear to be the same as those of the B109 element, both as seen after transfer to S. pneumoniae and as mapped by others in pDP5 after transposition in Streptococcus faecalis. We see no homology between the ends of the BM6001 element and find no evidence suggesting that it ever circularizes.
TI  - Timentin in combination with tobramycin as empirical therapy in febrile neutropenic patients with haematological malignancies.
AB  - Timentin (5.2 g tds) and tobramycin (40 mg tds) were administered to 51 patients  (22 male, 29 female, age range 17-72, mean age 40.4) with acute leukaemia, chronic myeloid leukaemia in blastic crisis, severe aplastic anaemia and acute agranulocytopenia. All patients had neutropenia (PMN less than 1000/mm3) and fever (greater than 38 degrees C). Febrile episodes consisted of 22 proved septicaemias due to Gram-positive organisms (Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, enterococcus) in 11 cases and to Gram-negative organisms (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Alkaligenes faecalis, Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae) in 10 cases. One patient had a polymicrobial infection (P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, non-haemolytic streptococcus). Twenty-nine infections were diagnosed only clinically. The mean duration of treatment was 11.1 days (range 4-20 days). Eighty-seven per cent of evaluable febrile episodes improved. Among 11 infections due to Gram-positive cocci, eight (72%) resolved, and in nine (90%) of ten cases due to Gram-negative bacilli success was obtained. The polymicrobial infection also resolved. In only four patients were mild side effects seen, e.g. exanthema, pruritus, phlebitis: renal toxicity was not observed. These data suggest that the combination of Timentin and tobramycin is an effective and safe empirical antibiotic regimen in febrile neutropenic patients.
TI  - Identification of regions of the Streptococcus faecalis plasmid pCF-10 that encode antibiotic resistance and pheromone response functions.
AB  - The conjugative plasmid pCF-10 (58 kb) of Streptococcus faecalis has been mapped  with restriction enzymes. By restriction mapping and Southern hybridization analysis, a 16-kb segment of the plasmid was shown to resemble closely the conjugative tetracycline resistance transposon, Tn916. Mutagenesis of the plasmid with the erythromycin resistance transposon Tn917 was used to localize a tetracycline resistance determinant and several regions involved in conjugal transfer. Fifty Tn917 insertions (outside the region of the plasmid homologous to Tn916) affecting mating behavior and the ability of donor cells to respond to the sex pheromone cCF-10 were mapped to nine distinct segments, or tra regions. Insertions into tra regions 1-3 and 7-9 led to an enhanced transfer ability of mutant plasmids relative to the transfer frequency obtained for the wild-type plasmid. Cells carrying these mutant plasmids differed in colony morphology or growth in broth culture from cells carrying pCF-10. Insertions into tra regions 4-6 resulted in reduced plasmid transfer, or completely eliminated the mating potential of donor cells. Insertions generating transfer-defective plasmids could be grouped further according to the ability of strains harboring the mutant plasmids to respond to cCF-10. HindIII fragments of pCF-10 coding for transfer functions have been cloned into Escherichia coli.
TI  - Differential scanning calorimetry of bacteria.
AB  - Thermograms obtained by differential scanning calorimetry of a range of bacteria  of different heat resistances were compared. Equations were derived to calculate the rate at which the numbers of viable organisms in a calorimeter decline as the temperature is raised at a constant rate. Vegetative bacteria scanned at 10 degrees C min-1 showed multi-peaked thermograms with four major peaks (denoted m, n, p and q) occurring in the regions 68-73, 77-84, 89-99 and 105-110 degrees C respectively. Exceptions were that peak m (the largest peak) occurred at 79-82 degrees C in Bacillus stearothermophilus and an additional peak, r, was detected in Escherichia coli at 119 degrees C. At temperatures below the main peak m there were major differences in thermograms between species. There was a direct relationship between the onset of thermal denaturation and the thermoresistance of different organisms. Heat-sensitive organisms displayed thermogram features which were absent in the more heat-resistant types. When samples were cooled to 5 degrees C and re-heated, a small endothermic peak, pr, was observed at the same temperature as p. Peaks p and pr were identified as the melting endotherms of DNA. In all vegetative organisms examined, maximum death rates, computed from published D and z values, occurred at temperatures above the onset of thermal denaturation, i.e. cell death and irreversible denaturation of cell components occurred within the same temperature range.
TI  - [Air-borne microbes in the vicinity of sewage treatment plants].
AB  - Measurements of air-borne germs were conducted over one year at several sewage treatment plants with different loads and sewage treatment methods. The investigations were intended to show possible air-borne loads in the sewage treatment plants and their immediate vicinity, taking into account different climatic conditions. The results lead to the conclusion that neighboring residential areas or factories in the vicinity of sewage treatment plants are not exposed to air-borne hazards.
TI  - The diffusion of pefloxacin into bone and the treatment of osteomyelitis.
AB  - Pefloxacin was evaluated in the treatment of bone infections. A clinical trial was performed in 15 patients with chronic osteitis (5 Staphylococcus aureus, 5 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 3 Serratia sp., 1 Proteus mirabilis, and a mixed infection with a Streptococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli). Patients were given pefloxacin 400 mg 12-hourly iv for 48 h followed by oral treatment. Bone biopsies from the iliac crest were carried out after at least seven days treatment, 2 h after the last dose. Serum levels were estimated at the same time. In 13 patients the pefloxacin levels were between 2 and 10 mg per g of bone and always greater than, or equal to, the MIC for the infecting organism. In 11 patients treated for six months and followed up for up to 14 months after the completion of treatment, the therapy was successful. In another two patients, the results were excellent with closure of fistulae, but there was only limited follow-up. There were two failures: in one (post-radiation osteitis) the infection persisted and in the other there was intolerance of the antimicrobial. In both cases there was no increase in the MIC of pefloxacin against the organisms. Three patients underwent operations for orthopaedic indications, after at least two months of treatment. Bone cultures from the initial focus remained sterile. Side-effects were mild.
TI  - In-vitro activity of pefloxacin compared to other antibiotics.
AB  - Pefloxacin is a new quinolone carboxylic acid with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity. A comparison was made of the in-vitro activity of pefloxacin and that of nine other antibiotics (ampicillin, ticarcillin, piperacillin, cefazolin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, gentamicin, amikacin and norfloxacin). The MIC90 of pefloxacin against 500 strains of Enterobacteriaceae ranged from 0.25 mg/l (Escherichia coli, indole + Proteus spp., Enterobacter cloacae, Salmonella spp. and Shigella spp.) to 1 mg/l (Klebsiella pneumoniae). Pefloxacin inhibited 90% of 52 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa at 2.5 mg/l (range 0.25 mg/l-4 mg/l). The MIC90 of pefloxacin against 100 Staphylococcus aureus strains (78 oxacillin resistant strains) was 0.4 mg/l (range 0.12-0.5 mg/l). It was markedly less active against Streptococcus faecalis and Str. pneumoniae (37 strains of each species) the MIC90 being 4 mg/l against both species. Overall, pefloxacin was at least as active as the third-generation cephalosporins against Enterobacteriaceae and was more active than any other antibiotic tested against P. aeruginosa, S. epidermidis, and S. aureus. Against E. coli, pefloxacin had a more rapid anti-bacterial activity than piperacillin. A paradoxical effect was observed with pefloxacin. An optimal killing rate was observed at concentrations of pefloxacin compatible with those one can expect in blood of patients treated with this drug.
TI  - [A study on the antibacterial activity of amniotic fluid--the significance of intraamniotic transferrin].
AB  - In order to study the antimicrobial activity of amniotic fluid, attempts were made to evaluate the in vivo growth of bacteria in amniotic fluid and the role of transferrin in antibacterial activity. The bacteria chosen for these experiments were Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus faecalis, respectively. The results obtained were as follows: Amniotic fluid was shown have an antibacterial effect on Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, while Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus faecalis proliferated readily in amniotic fluid. Individual difference in each sample appeared to be responsible for the inconsistent potency of the inhibitory effect observed. When amniotic fluid was heated at 100 degrees C for 5 minutes, the antibacterial activity was lost. The level of transferrin in amniotic fluid obtained at term was determined to be 29.1 +/- 17.6mg/dl (N = 90). The value correlated with neither those measured in cord sera nor maternal sera. The antimicrobial activity was restored by adding transferrin into heat-treated amniotic fluid at a concentration of 250mg/dl or higher. Simultaneous addition of transferrin and a sufficient concentration of iron made it possible to form a transferrin-iron complex. A subsequent decrease in unbound transferrin resulted in the loss of antibacterial properties.
TI  - Escherichia coli adherence to anion exchange resin. In vitro model for initial screening of potential antiadherence agents.
AB  - The first step in developing a bladder infection is attachment of bacteria to the bladder epithelium. Removing the bladder mucin increases bacterial adherence up to a thousand-fold, and this increase can be prevented by pretreating the mucin-deficient bladder with heparin. To develop a rapid, in vitro antiadherence screening assay, we studied the adherence of Escherichia coli to various chromatography resins and the ability of heparin and other agents to antagonize this attachment. The results can be summarized as follows: Although E. coli attached to all resins, only the adherence to the anion exchange resin was inhibited by heparin (up to 95%). Agents which did not effect E. coli adherence to the resin did not affect attachment to the bladder. Agents which inhibited E. coli adherence to the bladder also inhibited E. coli adherence to the resin. Similar to the effect of heparin on E. coli attachment, the adherence of Klebsiella ozaene, Proteus mirabilis, and Streptococcus fecalis to both bladder epithelium and anion exchange resin were also antagonized. These studies indicate that the adherence of E. coli (as well as other bacterial species) to anion exchange resin responds to heparin and other chemical agents in a similar manner as does adherence to the mucin-deficient rabbit urinary bladder. Because of the ease and rapid nature of this in vitro assay, it serves as a useful screen for potential bacterial antiadherence agents and could be used to help elucidate mechanisms of bacterial attachment.
TI  - The efficacy of pefloxacin in comparison to gentamicin in the treatment of experimentally induced peritonitis in rats.
AB  - A reproducible experimental model of intra-abdominal infections in rats has been  devised in order to stimulate intra-abdominal sepsis in patients. Pre-operatively, the rats were fed with lean ground beef for two weeks in order to change the intestinal flora to one similar to that of humans. A 1 cm segment of ileum was isolated on its vascular pedicle. The intestine was then divided at each end of the segment and intestinal continuity was re-established by an end-to-end anastomosis. The segment of ileum was then returned to the abdominal cavity. This experimental model was used to compare the efficacy of pefloxacin alone and in combination with metronidazole with the combination gentamicin and metronidazole in the treatment of intra-abdominal infections. Seventy per cent of the untreated animals died within two days. Within three days 40% of the animals receiving pefloxacin died. Animals treated with pefloxacin plus metronidazole or gentamicin plus metronidazole had a significantly decreased mortality and increased cure rates during the experimental period. Only 5% of these animals died. Thus the combination of pefloxacin and metronidazole seems to be as successful as gentamicin plus metronidazole in the treatment of intra-abdominal infections.

TI  - Bacterial colonization of Hemasite access devices.
AB  - Vascular access ports (Hemasites) were recovered from patients in whom they had become foci of infection and were examined according to microbiologic and morphologic techniques. All were covered on their extraluminal surfaces by well-developed biofilms consisting of host material and bacteria and their extracellular products. One Hemasite from which Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis were cultured was covered by a biofilm that consisted of coccoid bacterial cells and occasional fungal cells. Another Hemasite from which Proteus mirabilis was cultured was covered by a polymicrobial biofilm consisting of at least six morphologically distinct bacterial types and their extracellular products. This direct observation of the biofilm mode of bacterial growth on these devices suggests that the colonizing organisms will not be completely recovered by routine microbiologic techniques and that bacteria in the biofilm will tend to resist both host clearance mechanisms and antibiotic therapy. Removal of the device, with its accretion of bacterial biofilm, should allow the resolution of the associated infection.
TI  - Highly efficient protoplast transformation system for Streptococcus faecalis and  a new Escherichia coli-S. faecalis shuttle vector.
AB  - A highly efficient protoplast transformation system for Streptococcus faecalis has been developed by systematically optimizing different parameters. Up to 10(6) transformants per micrograms of DNA were consistently obtained within 3 days, and cell wall regeneration of protoplasts was virtually 100%. A systematic search for useful vectors showed that the broad-host-range plasmid pIP501 could transform S. faecalis at a high frequency (6.3 X 10(4) transformants per microgram). By combining a high-copy-number derivative of pIP501, designated pGB354, with the Escherichia coli vector pACYC184, we constructed a new E. coli-S. faecalis shuttle vector (pAM401) having nine unique restriction sites. In a shotgun cloning experiment, we ligated a tetracycline resistance determinant from Streptococcus sanguis chromosomal DNA into pAM401 by direct transformation of S. faecalis, establishing the utility of the protoplast transformation system and of the new shuttle vector.
TI  - Distribution of bacteria and yeasts within the 10-ml Isolator during the processing of seeded blood samples.
AB  - Forty-five organisms consisting of stock cultures and clinical isolates of bacteria and yeast were separately inoculated into outdated blood bank blood to achieve a concentration of approximately 100 CFU/ml. Blood with each organism was introduced into groups of four Isolators (E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., Inc., Wilmington, Del.), which were then processed according to the Isostat instructions of the manufacturer. The supernatant, sediment, and wash (material removed from the surface of the slanted stopper after sediment removal) were inoculated onto 5% sheep blood agar plates. Cultures were incubated aerobically (5 to 10% CO2) at 35 degrees C for 48 to 72 h. From the 180 Isolators, the mean recovery was 6% (range, 0 to 48%) for the supernatant, 87% (range, 47 to 98%) for the sediment, and 8% (range, 3 to 23%) for the wash. Neither variation among technologists nor intentional misalignment of additional Isolators in the centrifuge could explain all of the losses of microorganisms from the sediment. The manual nature of the Isolator procedure, which led to the loss of significant amounts of organisms from the sediment, may help to explain false-negative Isolator results obtained from blood of patients, particularly when small numbers of pathogens are present.
TI  - The seasonality of bacterial quality of water in a tropical developing country (Sierra Leone).
AB  - Natural water sources used as drinking-water supplies by rural settlements in Sierra Leone were examined monthly over a one-year period to detect any seasonal variations in bacterial quality. The 37 degrees C colony count, levels of selected faecal indicator bacteria and the incidence of Salmonella spp. were monitored. A seasonality was demonstrated for all the variables, counts generally increasing with the progression of the dry season, culminating in peaks at the transition from dry to wet season. Some complications with respect to the interpretation of counts of faecal indicator bacteria from raw tropical waters are noted.
TI  - Comparative adhesion of seven species of streptococci isolated from the blood of  patients with sub-acute bacterial endocarditis to fibrin-platelet clots in vitro.
AB  - The adhesion to fibrin-platelet clots in vitro of 21 strains of streptococci isolated from the blood of patients with sub-acute bacterial endocarditis (SABE) was measured. The species, in order of greatest adhesion, were Streptococcus faecalis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus milleri, Streptococcus sanguis, dextran-positive Streptococcus mitior, dextran-negative Streptococcus mitior and Streptococcus salivarius. Individual strains within species, however, cannot be assumed to be representative of their species and may exhibit unusually high or low adhesion. Adhesion depended upon both bacterial concentration and period of contact. There was no simple relationship between ability to adhere and liability to cause endocarditis. Formation of dextran did not increase adhesion. The streptococci were more adhesive than strains of Escherichia coli and Neisseria sicca and less adhesive than strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes.
TI  - [Aerobic bacterial flora of the nasal cavity of rabbits].
AB  - On the basis of bacteriological examinations carried out in April 1984 on 60 intranasal swabs, aerobic respiratory microbes were studied in rabbits. Differences in flora between animals with and without respiratory diseases were studied. Fourteen bacterial species were identified with no difference due to the pathological status. They were: Bordetella bronchiseptica, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus faecalis, Pasteurella multocida, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus sp., Branhamella catarrhalis, Micrococcus sp., Enterobacter agglomerans, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas paucimobilis, Pseudomonas diminuta, Alcaligenes faecalis and Escherichia coli. However, young weaned rabbits were more often Pasteurella carriers than adult females in maternity. The usefulness of performing only Pasteurella and Bordetella cultures in rabbits is questionable as is use of vaccines in order to prevent bacterial respiratory syndrome. It is emphasised that myxomatosis should be pursued in the investigation of respiratory infections in rabbit.

Experimental data on protective function of Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis and Bacteroides distasonis comprising intestinal flora against oral infection of Shigella flexneri which causes localized infection are presented. Furthermore, the present investigation deals with non-specific defense mechanism which indicate that protective activity of intestinal flora against parenteral infection of Salmonella typhimurium mainly depend upon the larger number of functional kupffer cells in conventional mice than in that of their germfree counterparts.
TI  - The in-vitro comparative activity of quinolones against bacteria from urinary tract infections in general practice.
AB  - In a study of lower urinary tract infection in general practice over twelve hundred strains have been isolated. Eight hundred and sixty-six consecutive strains were tested against four quinolone compounds. Sixty-nine per cent of the isolates were Escherichia coli and 15% coagulase-negative staphylococci (mostly Staphylococcus saprophyticus). The diffusion method, according to I.C.S. recommendation, was used and standardized for extrapolation of MIC results. Ciprofloxacin followed by norfloxacin and pefloxacin, was the most active quinolone compound (MIC 0 X 015-2 mg/l) against all strains, including multiresistant ones.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of seminalplasmin, a basic protein from bovine seminal plasma.
AB  - Seminalplasmin, a 6,000 dalton antimicrobial protein present in bovine seminal plasma, is shown to inhibit growth and/or RNA synthesis in several bacterial species. In only one strain out of twenty one belonging to fourteen species, did both RNA synthesis and growth appear to be resistant to seminalplasmin. The antibacterial activity of seminalplasmin, in the case of E. coli, was also studied as a function of its concentration and of time; the minimal concentration of the protein required for 100% bactericidal activity was only about twice that required for 100% bacteriostatic activity. The killing of E. coli cells proceeded in two phases, a slow phase and then a rapid one, and required several hours for completion. Several bacterial species tested secreted proteases into the medium that destroyed seminalplasmin.
TI  - Effect of bacterial products on prostaglandin E production by amnion cells.
AB  - An in-vitro model was set up to study a possible causal relation between bacterial colonisation of extraplacental membranes and spontaneous preterm labour. When amnion cells in tissue culture were exposed to bacterial products, their prostaglandin E output rose considerably. The degree of response varied with the organism. These findings support the theory that bacterial products may be responsible for the premature onset of labour.

TI  - Bacteriological study of renal calculi.
AB  - The pre-operative urine, pelvic urine, removed calculi and calculus washings were examined bacteriologically in 24 patients undergoing removal of intrarenal calculi. Four of seven patients with struvite calculi had an infected pre-operative midstream urine specimen and six of the seven removed calculi demonstrated significant bacterial growth. Proteus mirabilis was the commonest organism isolated. Of 17 patients with oxalate calculi only one had an infected pre-operative urine culture, but in four cases the removed stones were infected. Quantitative bacteriological culture of the stones and their washings demonstrated that infection is within the stone itself. Pre-operative urine culture failed to predict infection within the stone in 60% of patients with infected stones. The results suggest that the presence of infected urine together with the presence of renal calculus is indication for removal of the calculus.
TI  - Antimicrobial cream susceptibility testing.
AB  - Utilizing a recently described rapid needle extrusion method for determining the  sensitivities of burn wound isolates, we have compiled data on the resistance patterns of over 250 isolates from our burn unit. Major isolate groups were Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, various Enterobacteriaceae and Enterococci. Excellent correlation was exhibited between the inhibitory zone sizes and the minimal inhibitory concentration for 120 organisms tested. Utilizing the needle extrusion sensitivities to facilitate the selection of the burn creams, a significant reduction in the microbiologic flora of the burn wound was noted. The utilization of this technique in the selection of burn creams deserves controlled trials to assess whether changes in topical therapy might alter clinical outcome.
TI  - An investigation into in vitro methods for the detection of chlorhexidine resistance.
AB  - During an outbreak of catheter-related urinary tract infection, due to Proteus mirabilis, it was suggested that the epidemic strain was resistant to chlorhexidine. In this study, the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of chlorhexidine to the epidemic Pr. mirabilis and other laboratory isolates were tested in different media. Results were compared with killing times using 1/4 strength Ringers solution, normal human urine and the in vivo killing times in two patients' catheter bags. It was found that the MIC test was unreliable in the assessment of chlorhexidine resistance as it was dependent on the medium used, the inoculum size, and the age of the culture. The test which gave results closest to the in vivo experiments was the killing curve in normal human urine. It is concluded that chlorhexidine resistance is a complex phenomenon which is difficult to evaluate. If in vitro tests are to be used to evaluate the clinical relevance of reduced sensitivity to chlorhexidine, they must mimic the in-use conditions as closely as possible.
TI  - Bacteriology and ultrastructure of the bladder in patients with urinary tract infections.
AB  - Tissue obtained by biopsy of the bladder from 33 patients with various urinary tract symptoms was studied by conventional bacteriological techniques and by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). All the patients had recurrent urinary tract symptoms which had not completely responded to antibiotic therapy. Eleven of the patients had greater than or equal to 10(8) colony-forming units (CFU) of bacteria/1 urine; six had between 10(6) and 10(7) CFU/1, and 16 were abacteruric. Bacteria were isolated, however, from the tissue obtained by biopsy from eight of the 16 patients with sterile urine and bacteria were seen on the uro-epithelium in 14 of these patients. By comparison, in all samples of tissue obtained from the 11 patients with greater than or equal to 10(8) CFU/1 of urine bacteria were seen on the uro-epithelium and from nine of these, bacteria were subsequently grown. Fastidious organisms were not isolated from any of the patients. The uro-epithelium of all those studied was also shown to be grossly disrupted with increased disturbance and loss of the epithelial cells when compared with tissue obtained from uninfected patients. The degree of uro-epithelial disturbance was greatest in patients with histories of urinary tract infections lasting more than 4 months. The findings suggest that bacteriological examination of the urine does not always reflect bacterial infection on the bladder surface nor disruption of the uro-epithelium. The changes on the bladder surface may explain the patients' symptoms. In view of the results, a scheme is proposed that explains the development of symptoms in patients with urinary tract and bladder infections.
TI  - Infection control during parenteral nutrition therapy.
AB  - Parenteral nutrition therapy can achieve an anabolic state in patients who are unable to maintain normal nitrogen balance; however, it may be associated with infectious complications. Infections may be related to contamination of the cannula and the cannula wound, of the infusate, or of other parts of the parenteral nutrition system. A variety of microorganisms has been associated with these infections. The exact mechanisms that initiate cannula-related infection are poorly understood. Susceptibility of the host, the method and site of cannula insertion, colonization of parenteral nutrition cannulas, use of parenteral nutrition systems for multiple purposes, cannula material, and other factors may all play some role. Controlling infections depend on many factors, including quality control processes to ensure sterility of parenteral nutrition solutions, attention to aseptic technique during cannula insertion, procedures to prevent in-use contamination, proper care of the cannula insertion site, and proper management of other parts of the parenteral nutrition system. In addition, infectious complications appear to be reduced by an organized team that follows infection control protocols. Many facets of parenteral nutrition therapy are based on data from uncontrolled clinical investigations. Well-designed, controlled clinical trials may provide data that will further minimize the risks associated with parenteral nutrition therapy.
TI  - Further characterization of bacterial adherence to urinary bladder mucosa: comparison with adherence to anion exchange resin.
AB  - Bacterial adherence to anion exchange resin has recently been reported to provide a useful, rapid, in vitro screening assay for identifying putative antiadherence agents. The studies presented in this report provide additional evidence that adherence to anion exchange resin is similar to urinary bladder mucosa adherence. Results are as follows. 1) Heparin inhibits the adherence of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella ozaenae, Proteus mirabilis, Streptococcus fecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa to both the mucin deficient bladder and anion exchange resin. 2) Drugs which inhibit E. coli adherence to the bladder also inhibit E. coli adherence to the resin and conversely, drugs which do not effect E. coli adherence to the resin do not affect attachment to the bladder. 3) Extracts from mammalian urinary bladder mucosa prevent E. coli adherence to both the bladder and resin. 4) The ability of heparin to displace preattached bacteria from anion exchange resin is inversely proportional to the time the bacteria are in contact with resin. Similar results were obtained for the ability of heparin to displace bacteria from the bladder. These studies indicate that bacterial adherence to anion exchange resin responds to heparin and other chemical agents in a manner similar to the mucin deficient rabbit urinary bladder. Because of the ease and rapid nature of this in vitro assay, it serves as a useful screen for potential bacterial antiadherence agents and could be used to help elucidate mechanisms of bacterial attachment.
TI  - Complete nucleotide sequence of macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B-resistance  transposon Tn917 in Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - Streptococcus faecalis transposon Tn917 was cloned in Escherichia coli on plasmid vector pBR325. The erythromycin resistance determinant of Tn917 was not expressed in the E. coli background. The nucleotide sequence of Tn917 was determined and found to be 5,257 base pairs in length. Six open reading frames (ORFs) were identified and designated 1 through 6 (5' to 3'); all were on the same DNA strand. A region exhibiting strong homology with known promoters was identified upstream from ORF1. ORFs 1 to 3 were virtually identical to the previously sequenced erythromycin resistance determinant on Streptococcus sanguis plasmid pAM77. At the 3' point, where the homology between Tn917 and pAM77 ends, was a 20-base-pair region about 80% homologous with a component of the res site of Tn3. The amino acid sequence of ORF4 showed homology with other site-specific recombination enzymes, including approximately 30% homology with the resolvase of Tn3. Contained within Tn917 was a directly oriented 73-base-pair duplication of the left terminus. The Tn917 sequence revealed that antibiotic-enhanced transposition might be due to extension of transcription from the resistance-related genes (in ORFs 1 to 3) into transposition genes (in ORFs 4 to 6). Transcription analyses resulted in data consistent with this interpretation.
TI  - [Culture studies of the bile during transhepatic cholangiography].
AB  - A bacterial examination was carried out on bile taken from 119 patients undergoing transhepatic percutaneous cholangiography (P.T.C.) due to biliary obstruction. Bacteria were found in 36.9% of cases, with greater frequency in cases of benign obstructions (69.6%) than malignant obstructions (27.2%). The extent of obstruction was found to make no difference (stenotic or obstructive). These results therefore confirm that a risk of infectious complications during P.T.C. exist. Susceptibility studies carried out on bile bacteria showed gentamycin to be the most effective antibiotic in the prevention and treatment of infection in these cases.
TI  - Reactions of fish to microorganisms in wastewater.
AB  - Fish were inoculated with various microorganisms present in wastewater. A threshold concentration was determined over which these microorganisms were recovered from the muscles. The threshold concentrations were different for bacteria, bacteriophages, and polio 1 LSc virus. The threshold values were lower when fish were inoculated than when they were immersed in water containing these organisms. Depuration experiments were efficient when the fish did not contain high concentrations of bacteria in their muscles. As the threshold concentrations are an expression of the capability of the immune system of the fish, these values can be useful for the design and management of fishponds in which treated wastewater is used.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of ciprofloxacin in serum and urine against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - Ten volunteers received three doses of 500 mg ciprofloxacin, orally every 12 hours. After the last dose, mean serum levels were (mg/l +/- SD) 2.4 +/- 0.83 at 1 h; 0.91 +/- 0.30 at 4 h and 0.18 +/- 0.04 at 12 h. At 1 h the median serum bactericidal activity was satisfactory only against the Escherichia coli (1:256) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (1:128). In urine collected from 0 to 4 h and 8 to 12 h after the last dose, the mean ciprofloxacin level was respectively 482.5 +/- 324.7 and 80.9 +/- 48.2 mg/l +/- SD. Bactericidal activity in urine was high even against the least susceptible species tested: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis. A post antibiotic effect was demonstrated in 22 out of the 29 strains tested, ranging mainly from 1 to 3 h. Ciprofloxacin 500 mg orally twice a day is a bactericidal regimen against a wide range of urinary pathogens but has a limited systemic activity.
TI  - Evaluation of Malthus 128H microbiological growth analyser for detecting significant bacteriuria.
AB  - In a pilot study a prototype Malthus 128H microbiological growth analyser was used to study the growth of six commonly encountered urinary pathogens in a range of five different laboratory media. No single medium had been able to show acceptable conductance changes for all bacteria within five hours. Subsequently, the Malthus system, with fastidious anaerobe broth as the culture medium, was used to screen 500 consecutive clinical specimens of urine for significant bacteriuria. After two and a half hours the Malthus system detected 32 out of the 40 true positives and eight of the 44 contaminated urines. Increasing the detection time to five hours permitted the recognition of 39 true positives and 37 contaminated urines.
TI  - The bacterial phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system. Isolation  of active site peptides by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography and determination of their primary structure.
AB  - Using reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) it was possible to isolate 32P-labelled active-site regions of various proteins from the bacterial phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system. The purified peptides obtained by proteolytic cleavage with Lys-C protease and trypsin were sequenced by the gas phase method. The fragments derived from enzyme I (MW 70 000) of two streptococcal species show 100% homology. The analogous peptide of Staphylococcus aureus Enzyme I differs in the N-terminal region. A labelled peptide from the glucose-specific enzyme III protein of Escherichia coli obtained by cleavage with alkaline protease was isolated and sequenced. It could be fitted into the primary structure of this protein, which was derived from DNA sequence data. The active-site histidine residue of this protein is therefore localized at position 91. The HPLC separation method described is suitable for the isolation of peptides derived from active sites containing labile amino acid derivatives such as phosphohistidines.

TI  - Neonatal septicaemia.
AB  - A total of 410 proved cases of neonatal septicaemia from seven Finnish hospitals  seen between 1976 and 1980 were reviewed. The annual incidence of neonatal septicaemia was 3 per 1000 births, and overall mortality was 23%. Onset was early in most patients. Symptoms of septicaemia occurred within the first 24 hours of life in 44% and within the first week of life in 90%. In the very early onset disease (within 24 hours) mortality was 30%, compared with 17% in all other cases. Group B streptococcus was the leading cause in very early onset disease (52%) but mortality from infection with this organism was similar to that in other very early onset cases. It is concluded that very early onset neonatal septicaemia, probably of intrauterine origin and caused by group B streptococcus in one half of the cases, constitutes the major form of neonatal septicaemia in Finland and should receive the highest priority in preventive measures.
TI  - UV inactivation of pathogenic and indicator microorganisms.
AB  - Survival was measured as a function of the dose of germicidal UV light for the bacteria Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, Shigella sonnei, Streptococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacillus subtilis spores, the enteric viruses poliovirus type 1 and simian rotavirus SA11, the cysts of the protozoan Acanthamoeba castellanii, as well as for total coliforms and standard plate count microorganisms from secondary effluent. The doses of UV light necessary for a 99.9% inactivation of the cultured vegetative bacteria, total coliforms, and standard plate count microorganisms were comparable. However, the viruses, the bacterial spores, and the amoebic cysts required about 3 to 4 times, 9 times, and 15 times, respectively, the dose required for E. coli. These ratios covered a narrower relative dose range than that previously reported for chlorine disinfection of E. coli, viruses, spores, and cysts.
TI  - In vitro effects of sulphasalazine, azodisal sodium, and their metabolites on Clostridium difficile and some other faecal bacteria.
AB  - The effects of sulphasalazine (SASP), azodisal sodium (ADS), and their metabolites were tested in vitro on aerobic and anaerobic faecal bacterial strains. Sulphapyridine (SP) had a mild to moderate effect on Escherichia coli and Streptococcus faecalis. SASP also had a growth-inhibitory effect on Strep. faecalis. The other substances had no effect on the aerobic strains. SASP, SP, 5-aminosalicylic acid, and, to a certain extent, N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid exerted a growth-inhibitory effect on the anaerobic strains. Of special interest was the inhibitory effect on Clostridium difficile strains. In recent years the possibility that overgrowth of Cl. difficile could cause flare-ups of inflammatory bowel disease has been discussed. Some studies suggested that SASP treatment could predispose to Cl. difficile superinfection, whereas others found SASP more probable to exert a prophylactic effect. Our findings support the theory that SASP treatment reduces rather than promotes the risk of Cl. difficile superinfection.

TI  - [Cefminox concentration in tissues and clinical efficacy of cefminox in acute peritonitis].
AB  - Cefminox sodium (CMNX, MT-141), a new semisynthetic cephamycin, having marked resistance to beta-lactamase, and a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity against various bacterial species, including Haemophilus influenzae, Serratia marcescens and Citrobacter freundii, CMNX has higher activity in vivo than in vitro. For therapeutic purpose, CMNX was given in a daily dose of 0.5 g (0.5 g X 1) to 2 g (1 X 2) by intravenous drip infusion for 4 to 8 days to 24 cases with acute peritonitis (17 cases with acute appendicitis, 1 with localized peritonitis after gastrectomy, 1 with diffuse peritonitis due to perforative duodenal ulcer and 5 with panperitonitis due to intestinal obstruction). The clinical response was rated excellent in 9 cases, good in 14 cases and fair in 1 case and poor in none. No adverse effect was observed. There were 29 strains isolated organisms included 12 Escherichia coli, some Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These isolated organisms were eradicated after CMNX treatment, except a strain of E. faecalis was decreased. In 19 cases of them, 16 cases with acute peritonitis due to acute appendicitis and 3 cases with acute panperitonitis due to intestinal obstruction, CMNX was administered intravenously in a dose of 1 g (1 case was 0.5 g) before or during the operation, and tissue specimens and body fluids samples were taken during the operation. CMNX concentration was determined to a bioassay with Escherichia coli NIHJ or Vibrio vercolans ATCC 8461 as the test organisms. CMNX concentrations in purulent ascites were 47.2 +/- 38.5 micrograms/ml (n = 23), those in infected appendix wall were 32.2 +/- 21.7 micrograms/g (n = 16), that in pus in appendix were 22.1 +/- 24.3 micrograms/ml (n = 8) and that in other non infected tissues were 24.3 +/- 22.0 micrograms/g (n = 8). CMNX concentrations in infected tissues were higher than the non infected tissues. In the 3 cases with empyemic appendicitis, CMNX levels in pus in appendix were more higher than that in appendix wall itself. Therefore, CMNX sodium appears to be a very useful drug when used for chemotherapy on acute peritonitis.
TI  - [Comparative antibacterial activity of piperacillin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Streptococcus faecalis in cultures and human serum].
AB  - The in vitro activity of piperacillin at 1/4, 1 and 4 X MHK against 5 strains each of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Streptococcus faecalis was compared in Mueller-Hinton-bouillon and human serum. Serum without piperacillin was bacteriostatic against P. aeruginosa for 8 hrs., against E. coli for 24 hrs. Subinhibitory piperacillin concentrations were bacteriostatic against E. coli, but had no effect against P. aeruginosa and S. faecalis. Bactericidal activity against E. coli was achieved at 1 X MHK against P. aeruginosa and S. faecalis at 4 X MHK. Except for P. aeruginosa in concentrations of 1/4 and 1 X MHK the piperacillin activity in bouillon and serum was almost identical.

TI  - Bacterial synergism between the enterococcus and Escherichia coli.
AB  - The pathogenicity of the enterococcus in surgical infections remains unclear. To  examine this issue, rats received an intravascular infusion of 10(9) enterococcus. No rats died. Rats that received a sublethal inoculum of Escherichia coli with 5 X 10(8) enterococcus had a 40% mortality (P less than 0.05). Cutaneous infections in rabbits with E. coli, Bacteroides fragilis, and enterococcus were examined singly and in combination. Infections with E. coli measured 21 +/- 1 mm, with enterococcus were 15 +/- 1 mm, and with B. fragilis were 9 +/- 1 mm in diameter. When E. coli and enterococcus were combined together, significantly larger cutaneous infections were noted (P less than 0.05). No apparent synergism existed between the enterococcus and B. fragilis. These data indicate a synergistic relationship between the enterococcus and E. coli.
TI  - Chemotaxis by Entamoeba histolytica.
AB  - A micropore membrane procedure to assay taxis by Entamoeba histolytica is described and the results of studies of responses to a variety of soluble substances, bacteria, an rat colon washings using this procedure are reported. Trophozoites migrated in blind well chambers through 8-micron pore size polycarbonate membranes but not nitrocellulose membranes up to 12 micron pore size. Amoebae were attracted toward fresh axenic culture medium (TYI-S), an enzymatic hydrolysate of casein (Trypticase), and a partially purified preparation of N-acetylneuraminic acid from egg mucin, but not purified N-acetylneuraminate or a variety of other low molecular weight metabolites. The response was verified as chemotaxis by checkerboard analysis. Amoebae migrated most dramatically toward suspensions of all of seven bacterial species tested, including motile and non-motile, gram-negative and gram-positive rods and cocci. This response was diminished when the bacteria concentration gradient was eliminated. The response to bacteria culture filtrates was less than 10% of that to bacterial suspensions. A response to clarified washings from the rat colon was detected; this was diminished but not eliminated by filter sterilization of the washings. We concluded that some soluble molecules, possibly of intermediate molecular size, whole bacteria, and both soluble and particulate components of the rat colon provide tactic stimuli for E. histolytica. Scanning electron micrographs of trophozoites migrating towards attractants through membranes showed narrow, extended pseudopodia entering the membrane pores, and enlarging spheres exiting as the cells proceeded through.

TI  - Transformation and fusion of Streptococcus faecalis protoplasts.
AB  - Nonconjugative plasmids were transferred by protoplast fusion among Streptococcus faecalis strains and from Streptococcus sanguis to S. faecalis. S. faecalis protoplasts were also transformed with several different plasmids, including the Tn917 delivery vehicle pTV1. Transformation was reproducible, but low in frequency (10(-6) transformants per viable protoplast). A new shuttle vector (pAM610), able to replicate in Escherichia coli and S. faecalis, was constructed and transformed into S. faecalis protoplasts. pAM610 was mobilized by the conjugative plasmid pAM beta 1 in matings among S. faecalis strains and from S. sanguis to S. faecalis. Chimeric derivatives of pAM610 were also transformed into S. faecalis.
TI  - Mucin degradation in human colon ecosystems. Isolation and properties of fecal strains that degrade ABH blood group antigens and oligosaccharides from mucin glycoproteins.
AB  - We previously reported that the oligosaccharide chains of hog gastric mucin were  degraded by unidentified subpopulations numbering approximately 1% of normal human fecal bacteria. Here we report on the enzyme-producing properties of five strains of mucin oligosaccharide chain-degrading bacteria isolated from feces of four healthy subjects. Four were isolated from the greatest fecal dilutions yielding mucin side chain-degrading activity in culture, and thus were the numerically dominant side chain-degrading bacteria in their respective hosts. Three were Ruminococcus strains and two were Bifidobacterium strains. Two Ruminococcus torques strains, IX-70 and VIII-239, produced blood group A- and H-degrading alpha-glycosidase activities, sialidase, and the requisite beta-glycosidases; these strains released greater than 90% of the anthrone-reacting hexoses from hog gastric mucin during growth in culture. The Bifidobacterium strains lacked A-degrading activity but were otherwise similar; these released 60-80% of the anthrone-reacting hexoses but not the A antigenic structures from hog gastric mucin. Only Ruminococcus AB strain VI-268 produced blood group B-degrading alpha-galactosidase activity, but this strain lacked beta-N-acetylhexosaminidases to complete degradation of B antigenic chains. When this strain was co-cultured with a strain that produced beta-N-acetylhexosaminidases, release of hexoses from blood group B salivary glycoprotein increased from 50 to greater than 90%, and bacterial growth was enhanced. The glycosidases required for side chain degradation were produced by these strains in the absence of mucin substrate, and a substantial fraction of each activity in stationary phase cultures was extracellular. In contrast, none of 16 other fecal Bacteroides, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus faecalis, and Bifidobacterium strains produced ABH blood group-degrading enzymes; other glycosidases produced by these strains were predominantly cell bound except for extracellular beta-N-acetylhexosaminidases produced by the five S. faecalis strains. We conclude that certain Bifidobacterium and Ruminococcus strains are numerically dominant populations degrading mucin oligosaccharides in the human colon due to their constitutive production of the requisite extracellular glycosidases including blood group antigen-specific alpha-glycosidases. These properties characterize them as a functionally distinct subpopulation of normal human enteric microflora comprised of specialized subsets that produce blood group H antigen-degrading glycosidases alone or together with either blood group A- or B-degrading glycosidases.
TI  - Detection of beta-lactamase activity with nitrocefin of multiple strains of various microbial genera.
AB  - The production or presence of beta-lactamase(s) was studied by the rapid method utilizing the chromogenic cephalosporin compound nitrocefin in cultures of multiple strains belonging to the same genus as well as groups of microorganisms. The genera were: Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, indole-positive Proteus spp., Enterobacter spp., Serratia marcescens, rare Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. With this sensitive and rapid assay for beta-lactamase, it was possible to verify and separate the beta-lactamase producing cultures from the non-producers and include the useful strains to on-going research, such as beta-lactam screen, beta-lactamase inhibitory study and lytic properties of beta-lactams. The data also provide evidence for the possible role of beta-lactamase(s) in the physiology, biochemistry and pathogenicity of bacterial strains. The nitrocefin method was found a very specific and extremely useful procedure for the detection and estimation of beta-lactamase activity.
TI  - Protective activity of Streptococcus faecalis against pathogenic action of Escherichia coli O55 in gnotobiotic pigs.
AB  - Peroral administration of Streptococcus faecalis suppresses the lethal effect of  simultaneous or subsequent infection with pathogenic Escherichia coli O55 in gnotobiotic colostrum-free piglets. The presence of S. faecalis in the intestine and mesenteric lymph nodes in artificially diassociated colostrum-free piglets influences neither multiplication of E. coli in the intestine nor its penetration into the organism.
TI  - [Evaluation of bacterial growth rate by the ATP-bioluminescence method (luciferase assay)--comparison with conventional methods and application to clinical studies].
AB  - Bacterial growth rate was evaluated by estimating the increase in ATP content of  cultures of bacterial suspensions using luciferase assay, and the method was applied to the estimation of bactericidal activity of serum and anti-bacterial activity of antibiotics. The results obtained were as follows: The bacterial numbers or bacterial growth rate determined by the ATP-Bioluminescence method was in accordance with those by CFU assay and spectrometrical assay by optical density readings. Furthermore this method was confirmed to be non-time-consuming and more simple than other methods. Using this method, anti-bacterial activity of fresh serum was evaluated. The serum suppressed the growth rate of E. coli, Str. fecalis, CBS, Kleb. pneumoniae and Staph. aureus at least for 2 hours. Heat-inactivated serum and absorbed serum with bacteria tended to lose such suppressive effect. Thus the main effective factors seem to be complements and specific antibody. The anti-microbial activity of antibiotics was enhanced by addition of fresh serum to bacterial cultures, and the results were not in accordance with those by the conventional Disc method. Thus the sensitivity test under the influence of fresh serum is recommended in order to know the clinical effect of antibiotics. These results suggest the usefulness of ATP-Bioluminescence method in the clinical laboratory examinations or investigations.
TI  - Survival and detection of Bacteroides spp., prospective indicator bacteria.
AB  - Preliminary experiments were performed to assess the use of intestinal Bacteroides spp. as indicators of fecal contamination of water. Viable counts of Bacteroides fragilis, an anaerobic bacterium, declined more rapidly than those of Escherichia coli and Streptococcus faecalis. However, a fluorescent antiserum prepared against B. fragilis successfully detected high proportions (18 to greater than 50%) of B. fragilis cells suspended for 8 days in aerobic water in dialysis bags at the ambient temperature. These percentages were higher than the percent viable recoveries of the two indicator bacteria used for comparison. Thus, the fluorescent antiserum test for B. fragilis might serve as a useful indicator of fecal contamination of water. An advantage of this approach over coliform analysis is the rapidity at which the test can be performed.
TI  - Gram-positive superinfections following beta-lactam chemotherapy: the significance of the enterococcus.
AB  - The recent literature was reviewed with regard to the risks of superinfection following beta-lactam chemotherapy. The summary publications for the pseudomonas-active penicillins (azlocillin, carbenicillin, mezlocillin, piperacillin and ticarcillin), cefoperazone, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, imipenem and moxalactam show marked variations. Moxalactam was most likely to produce both gram-negative (5-38%) and enterococcal (2.2-12%) superinfections. Ceftazidime or moxalactam therapy was more often associated with anaerobic superinfections, usually by Clostridium spp., than the other beta-lactams. Comparable and lower incidences of superinfections were cited for cefoperazone, ceftazidime, mezlocillin and imipenem. The most common pathogens for the above drugs were the fungi (Candida spp.), Pseudomonas spp. and some beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae. Staphylococcal, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp. secondary infections were more common in patients receiving the newer penicillins. Cefotaxime had a very low incidence of superinfections (1.1%), especially caused by gram-positive organisms such as enterococci. The reasons for this favorable feature seem to be: excellent inhibitory activity and beta-lactamase stability against a wide variety of bacterial pathogens, synergistic interactions of cefotaxime and its desacetyl metabolite, enhanced anti-enterococcal activity of cefotaxime in the presence of a human serum factor and interactions of cefotaxime and desacetyl cefotaxime to suppress the development of antimicrobial resistance. The most common superinfections following cefotaxime treatment were with Pseudomonas spp., Enterobacter spp. and fungi. Cefotaxime appears to possess physical-chemical characteristics that react favorably with bacteria and the host to minimize gram-positive superinfections, especially with most enteric Streptococcus spp. (Streptococcus faecalis and Streptococcus faecium).
TI  - Molecular cloning of a pIP501 derivative yields a model replicon for the study of streptococcal conjugation.
AB  - We have previously constructed a derivative of the broad host range streptococcal plasmid pIP501, a conjugative plasmid designated pVA797, that confers chloramphenicol resistance and contains a unique EcoRI site in a non-essential region of the plasmid molecule. pVA797 (30.7 kb) when cloned in toto as an EcoRI fragment into the positive selection vector pOP203(A2+) gave a recombinant, pVA904 (37.7 kb), which was able to replicate in Escherichia coli and in streptococcal species. It can be phenotypically monitored in either genus by specific drug resistance markers (chloramphenicol resistance in streptococci, tetracycline resistance in E. coli). pVA904 segregates into E. coli minicells where it specifies the production of at least 13 polypeptides. Many of the polypeptides are missing in minicells containing a transfer-defective, deletion derivative of pVA904. pVA904 is an ideal model replicon for the study of streptococcal conjugation because it is a shuttle plasmid thus enabling manipulation using procedures established for E. coli. Specifically, it should be possible to define the genetic basis of streptococcal conjugation by coupling mutagenesis protocols and minicell protein analyses in E. coli with evaluation of transfer function in streptococci.

TI  - Return of Streptococcus faecalis DNA cloned in Escherichia coli to its original host via transformation of Streptococcus sanguis followed by conjugative mobilization.
AB  - Cloning vectors were introduced into Streptococcus faecalis by conjugation. A conjugative plasmid (pVA797) and cloning vector pVA838 recombined in Streptococcus sanguis at homologous sequences, forming a cointegrate. The pVA797::pVA838 cointegrate transferred to S. faecalis by conjugation. Recombination between homologous sequences resolved the cointegrate in the S. faecalis transconjugants, and pVA797 and pVA838 segregated because of incompatibility. S. faecalis strains that received pVA838 by this mechanism contained plasmids indistinguishable from authentic pVA838 from Escherichia coli. Other plasmids, including pVA736, were introduced into S. faecalis by this method. This approach should facilitate the introduction of cloned DNA into S. faecalis.
TI  - Colonization and persistence of Escherichia coli in axenic and monoxenic turkeys.
AB  - Sites of colonization and persistence of virulent (O78) and avirulent (O2) Escherichia coli were determined in 3-week-old axenic turkeys. Colonization of O78 in turkeys infected with Streptococcus faecalis was also determined. Colonization and persistence of E coli in the intestinal tract and lung were not correlated with virulence. Both serotypes persisted in high titer in crop, ileum, ceca, colon, and lung. Persistence of E coli in the liver was positively correlated with virulence, although both serotypes were recovered from the liver in the absence of bacteremia, indicating possible intestinal translocation of E coli to the liver. A reduction in intestinal colonization and translocation of O78 was determined in monoxenic turkeys infected with S faecalis. In contrast, S faecalis had no effect on lung titers of O78. Air sacculitis, pericarditis, and pneumonia were observed in axenic and monoxenic turkeys infected with O78. Bacteremia was detected in a turkey exposed to O78.
TI  - A microbiological study of various food premises with an assessment of cleaning and disinfection practices.
AB  - A study of cleaning and disinfection methods in a variety of types of catering premises has been carried out. The level of bacterial contamination of the hands and of equipment was related to cleaning methods and to the type of catering establishment. Wiping cloths were frequently contaminated with Escherichia coli, and these may be important reservoirs of bacteria for contamination of the hands of catering staff. Regular and efficient cleaning of food surfaces and equipment was found to be more important than the use of a disinfectant as part of the cleaning process. Methods for reducing the risks of cross-contamination in catering premises are discussed.
TI  - Quality control of susceptibility tests with 5-micrograms trimethoprim disks.
AB  - In 1981 and again in 1984, we performed multi-laboratory studies to develop quality control limits for susceptibility tests with 5-micrograms trimethoprim disks. Zone size limits of 21 to 28 mm are recommended for tests with Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, and limits of 19 to 26 mm are recommended for tests with Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923. For screening Mueller-Hinton agar, tests with Streptococcus faecalis ATCC 33186 or ATCC 29212 are recommended: zones should be fairly clear and greater than or equal to 22 mm (trimethoprim disks) or greater than or equal to 24 mm (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole disks).
TI  - A randomized double-blind investigation of cefroxadine (CGP 9000) versus cephalexin in urinary tract infection.
AB  - A total of 64 out-patients with significant urinary tract infection were randomly allocated to treatment with cefroxadine 250 mg q.i.d. or cephalexin 500 mg q.i.d. for ten days. Urine cultures were performed before allocation to the treatment groups and on Days 0, 1, 3, 7 and 21. Twenty patients discontinued treatment prematurely because of insignificant bacteriuria on Day 0. Both drug regimes--the cefroxadine dose was half that of cephalexin--showed good activity during treatment, and no statistically significant differences were found between the two drugs. At follow-up, several relapses were found in both treatment groups. Adverse drug reactions were only reported by three patients in the cefroxadine group, and by none in the cephalexin group.
TI  - Regeneration of insertionally inactivated streptococcal DNA fragments after excision of transposon Tn916 in Escherichia coli: strategy for targeting and cloning of genes from gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The conjugative transposon Tn916 (15 kilobases), originally identified in Streptococcus faecalis DS16, has been cloned as an intact element on the pBR322-derived vector pGL101 in Escherichia coli. The EcoRI F' (EcoRI F::Tn916) fragment of pAM211 (pAD1::Tn916) was cloned into the single EcoRI site of pGL101 to form the chimera, pAM120, by selecting for the expression of Tn916-encoded tetracycline resistance (Tcr). Interestingly, in the absence of continued selection for Tcr, Tn916 excised from pAM120 at high frequency. This excision event resulted in a plasmid species consisting of the pGL101 vector and a 2.7-kilobase restriction fragment comigrating with the EcoRI F fragment of pAD1 during agarose gel electrophoresis. Filter blot hybridization experiments showed the 2.7-kilobase fragment generated as a result of Tn916 excision to be homologous with the EcoRI F fragment of pAD1. Analogous results were obtained with another chimera, pAM170, generated by ligating the EcoRI D' (EcoRI D::Tn916) fragment of pAM210 (pAD1::Tn916) to EcoRI-digested pGL101. Comparison of the AluI and RsaI cleavage patterns of the EcoRI F fragment isolated after Tn916 excision with those from an EcoRI F fragment derived from pAD1 failed to detect any difference in the two fragments: data in support of a precise Tn916 excision event in E. coli. Subcloning experiments showed that an intact transposon was required for Tn916 excision and located the Tcr determinant near the single HindIII site on Tn916. Although excision occurred with high frequency in E. coli, Tn916 insertion into the E. coli chromosome was a much rarer event. Tcr transformants were not obtained when pAM120 DNA was used to transform a polA1 strain, E. coli C2368.

TI  - [Comparative studies of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from urinary tract infections (1982). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - In vitro activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated  from patients with urinary tract infections were investigated by dilution method using MIC 2000 (Dynatec) during July to October in 1982. The summarized results are as follows: PMPC and CCL have showed potent activities against E coli among the oral antimicrobial agents. PMPC and CCL at 3.13 micrograms/ml inhibited 90% of E. coli tested. CTM, CTX, CZX, CMX and LMOX at concentrations of 0.39 microgram/ml or less among the parenteral antimicrobial agents inhibited 90% of E. coli tested. The value of MIC90 (concentration at which 90% of isolates are inhibited) against K. pneumoniae results in the resistant range for ABPC, NA, CEX, CCL and ST. Among the parenteral cephems, CMX seemed most effective against K. pneumoniae tested. C. freundii seemed generally low susceptible to antimicrobial agents tested. Among the oral agents, PMPC, PPA and ST have showed moderate activity against C. freundii. Among the parenteral agents, CMX and LMOX also showed moderate activity against C. freundii, inhibiting 50% of the strains tested at 6.25 micrograms/ml. Among the oral agents, PMPC showed the most potent activity against E. cloacae. E. cloacae tested were highly resistant to the first and second generation cephems. Among the third generation, CMX seemed the most potent activity against E. cloacae isolated. However, CMX concentration of 1.56 micrograms/ml was necessary to inhibit 50% of tested E. cloacae. P. mirabilis tested was resistant to all oral antimicrobial agents except CCL and ST. The value of MIC90 of the first and second generation cephems against P. mirabilis results in the moderately susceptible range (6.25-25 micrograms/ml). The third generation seemed most effective against P. mirabilis tested. PMPC, NA, PPA and ST concentrations of 0.78-1.56 micrograms/ml were necessary to inhibit 50% of tested P. vulgaris. CEZ and CTM, seemed less potent activity than CFX and CMZ against P. vulgaris. CTX, CZX, CMX and LMOX except CPZ have showed potent activities against P. vulgaris, these at 0.1 micrograms/ml or less inhibited 50% of P. vulgaris tested. P. aeruginosa has been resistant to the third generation cephems except CPZ, but TOB, GM, AMK, CFS, PIPC and CPZ have showed high activities against P. aeruginosa, inhibiting 50% of the strains tested at 0.39-6.25 micrograms/ml. The oral antimicrobial agents, and first and second generation cephems had not showed significant activity against S. marcescens. And strains of S. marcescens were relatively susceptible to the third generation cephems.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

TI  - Septic complications of percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage. Evaluation of a new closed drainage system.
AB  - In a consecutive study of 49 patients with obstructive jaundice who underwent preoperative percutaneous transhepatic drainage, the incidence of bacteria in bile at the time of insertion of the drainage catheter was 29 percent. Patients drained with a conventional open drainage system showed an increase to 100 percent positive cultures after 20 days drainage. In this group, there was also a high incidence of episodes of bacteremia preoperatively and postoperatively and a high incidence of positive wound cultures. An antiseptic barrier incorporated into the drainage system reduced the incidence of positive bile cultures during the drainage period although this did not afford a significant reduction in bacteremic episodes and positive wound cultures. Using a new closed drainage system, the acquisition of environmental organisms to the bile was eliminated which allowed a significant reduction in septic complications both preoperatively and postoperatively. This new closed drainage system increased the value of preoperative decompression of the obstructed biliary tree by preventing exogenous bacterial contamination and reducing associated septic episodes.

TI  - Evaluation of a surfactant mixture C31G as a teat dip by a modified excised teat  model.
AB  - A mixture of amphoteric surfactants with antimicrobial properties, C31G, was evaluated as a teat dip by a modified excised teat model. The model was modified to avoid misinterpretation of results from indigenous bacterial microflora on teats. In three experiments, bacterial numbers recovered from teats dipped in .75, 1.5, and 3.0% solutions of C31G were compared with bacteria recovered from undipped teats (negative controls) and teats dipped with 1.0% iodophor (an effective teat dip). Mean log reductions of teat end concentrations of Staphylococcus, aureus, Streptococcus fecalis, and Escherichia coli were determined in each experiment. Efficacy was greatest for the 3.0% solution of C31G with mean log reductions (Log reduction = Log 10 of controls - Log 10 of dipped teats) 3.53 for Staphylococcus aureus, 2.89 for Streptococcus fecalis, and 3.16 for Escherichia coli. Iodophor (1%) yielded mean log reductions of 3.26 for Staphylococcus aureus, 2.16 for Streptococcus fecalis, and 2.83 for Escherichia coli. For all three organisms, number of viable organisms decreased with increasing concentrations of C31G. The efficacy of C31G should be evaluated in vivo.
TI  - Physical and genetic analyses of streptococcal plasmid pAM beta 1 and cloning of  its replication region.
AB  - Plasmid pAM beta 1, originally isolated from Streptococcus faecalis DS5, mediates resistance to the MLS (macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin B alpha) group of antibiotics. A restriction endonuclease map of the 26.5-kilobase (kb) pAM beta 1 molecule was constructed by using the enzymes AvaI, HpaII, EcoRI, PvuII, Kpn1, BstEII, HpaI, HhaI, and HindIII. A comparison of this map to those of four independently isolated deletion derivatives of pAM beta 1 located the MLS resistance determinant within a 2-kb DNA segment and at least one conjugative function within an 8-kb region. The 5.0-kb EcoRI-B fragment from pAM beta 1 was ligated onto the 4.0-kb Escherichia coli plasmid vector, pACKC1, and used to transform E. coli HB101. The 9.0-kb chimeric plasmid was then used to transform Streptococcus sanguis Challis with concurrent expression of the E. coli kanamycin resistance determinant. The 5.0-kb EcoRI-B fragment from pAM beta 1 was subsequently used as a vector to clone a streptomycin resistance determinant from a strain of Streptococcus mutans containing no detectable plasmid DNA. Subcloning experiments, using a HindIII partial digest of pAM beta 1 DNA, narrowed the replication region of this plasmid to a 2.95-kb fragment.

AB  - 110 children, affected by UTI, were included in this study; 52 of them were treated for 10 days and the remaining 58 for 3 days. Both groups were treated with cotrimoxazole or nitrofurantoin. Urine cultures were repeated soon after the end of therapy and repeated subsequently for a period of 6 months or of 1 year. There is not a great difference between the results obtained with the 10 days treatment and those of the 3 days treatment. An high percentage of relapses occurred in UTI caused by Proteus and Klebsiella.
TI  - Toxicity of microbial products in cell culture.
AB  - Cytotoxicity of a mixed pyrogen preparation and its components as well as native  and radiodetoxified lipopolysacharides (LPS) was determined with established HEp-2 cell cultures and by measuring plating efficiency. This proved to be more sensitive to the damaging effect of both microbe-containing LPS (Escherichia coli) and purified LPS. Microorganisms without this compound (Lactobacillus casei, Streptococcus faecalis) seem to be more infifferent on cells, even Saccharomyces cerevisiae has a marked augmenting effect on cell plating. Divergence in null-toxicity between the established cultures and plating efficiency makes it possible to presume that the primary effect of microorganisms on epithelial cells is medited by LPS, and the subsequent liberation of lysosomal proteinases is responsible for major biological effects.
TI  - The effects of heparin on the adherence of five species of urinary tract pathogens to urinary bladder mucosa.
AB  - Previous studies performed in our laboratory have indicated that the primary antibacterial defense mechanism of the rabbit urinary bladder is the antiadsorptive action of the surface mucopolysaccharide. Removal of this layer with an acid rinse increases bacterial adherence up to 100 fold. Exogenous mucopolysaccharide (heparin) has been shown to restore Escherichia coli adherence to control levels. To determine whether this antiadherence action of heparin is species specific, we compared the adherence of 5 common urinary tract pathogens (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella ozonae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Streptococcus fecalis) to both mucin intact and mucin deficient rabbit bladders with and without prior heparin exposure. Bacteria were radiolabeled by addition of 3H-adenine to the culture broth so that the number of bacteria adhering to the bladder could be determined using liquid scintillation spectrophotometry. Results were as follows: Acid removal of the mucin layer significantly increased the adherence approximately 10 fold for all 5 species tested. Briefly exposing the mucin deficient bladders to heparin decreased the adherence of all species tested except Pseudomonas to mucin intact control levels. Heparin treatment of mucin intact bladders slightly decreased adherence of all species except Pseudomonas below mucin intact controls, however, results were not statistically significant. The magnitude of Klebsiella adherence was nearly 20 fold greater than all other species tested. While this non-species specific adherence inhibition of heparin may prove useful in the clinical setting, it appears to be less effective against Pseudomonas.
TI  - Non-protein-bound iron within bacterial cells and the action of bleomycin.
AB  - Damage to DNA by bleomycin in vitro is entirely dependent on the presence of an iron salt and molecular oxygen. This same reaction has been used to measure non-protein-bound iron in different bacterial species. Although several of the species examined were insensitive to the toxic effects of bleomycin, they all contained a concentration of non-protein-bound iron which should have been sufficient to allow iron-dependent damage to DNA. Other factors such as permeability or inactivation of the drug must explain their apparent insensitivity.

TI  - A microbiological evaluation of apalcillin.
AB  - The in vitro activity of apalcillin was tested against 350 clinical isolates of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter, Klebsiella, Proteus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus faecalis. Using a minimal inhibitory concentration of 16 mg/l as the breakpoint, only 19.7% of the strains were resistant to apalcillin. A regression analysis demonstrated that it is possible to test bacteria for sensitivity with a 20 micrograms apalcillin disc. The results on Mueller-Hinton agar are very similar to those on Iso-Sensitest medium. Like other ureido penicillins, apalcillin is sensitive to most beta-lactamases; it is effective against ampicillin-resistant strains since it penetrates the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria well and is highly effective against target proteins. Strains producing high amounts of beta-lactamases do become resistant to apalcillin.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of antimicrobial drugs in simulated urine specimens at various temperatures of incubation.
AB  - A total of 23 antimicrobial drugs were examined for bactericidal activity in midstream-urine against Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, or Streptococcus faecalis ATCC 29212 at incubation temperatures of 35, 22, and 7 degrees C, respectively. The majority of chemotherapeutic agents significantly reduced bacterial inocula within 2 h at 35 degrees C. At room temperature, most drugs required 4 h for significant killing activity to ensue. At 7 degrees C only nitrofurantoin, polymyxin B, and rifampin were significantly active within 2 to 4 h following exposure. Following prolonged (overnight) incubation at 7 degrees C, however, 10 of 23 drugs (amikacin, cefotaxime, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, nalidixic acid, netilmicin, nitrofurantoin, polymyxin B, rifampin, and vancomycin) effected reduction of bacterial colony counts of greater than or equal to 50%. On the basis of these data it is recommended that urine specimens from patients with known antibacterial chemotherapy should not be refrigerated for longer than 2 to 4 h following collection.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence of the Streptococcus faecalis plasmid gene encoding the 3'5"-aminoglycoside phosphotransferase type III.
AB  - We have cloned in Escherichia coli and sequenced a 1489-bp DNA fragment conferring resistance to kanamycin and originating from the streptococcal plasmid pJH1. The resistance gene was located by analysis of the initiation and termination codons in an open reading frame (ORF) of 792 bp. The deduced gene product, a 3'5''-aminoglycoside phosphotransferase of type III, has an Mr of 29,200. Comparison of its amino acid sequence with those of type I (Oka et al., 1981) and type II (Beck et al., 1982) 3' phosphotransferase, from transposable elements Tn903 and Tn5, respectively, indicated a statistically significant structural relationship between these enzymes from phylogenetically remote bacterial genera. The degree of homology observed indicate that phosphotransferase type III and type I genes have diverged from a common ancestor and that the phosphotransferase type II gene has emerged more recently from the type I evolutionary pathway.
TI  - [Long-term results after endoscopic papillotomy].
AB  - A long-term control study after endoscopic papillotomy was performed in 102 patients at least 12 months after the procedure. 14 patients were no longer alive, from those only one patient died due to biliary problems. Complications occurred in 10 patients (9,8%). There was no cholangitis, but 2 cases of an acute cholecystitis some time after papillotomy. Therefore a cholecystectomy after papillotomy is suggested in the interval.
TI  - Removal of bacteria from water by adhesion to cross-linked poly(vinylpyridinium halide).
AB  - Cross-linked poly(vinylpyridinium halide) was found to have a novel and remarkable ability to remove bacteria from water. For example, when 10 g (wet weight) of cross-linked poly(N-benzyl-4-vinylpyridinium bromide) was contacted with 20 ml of suspensions of Escherichia coli (9.7 X 10(4) to 9.7 X 10(7)/ml), Salmonella typhimurium (8.0 X 10(6) to 1.1 X 10(7)/ml), Streptococcus faecalis (5.0 X 10(7)/ml), Staphylococcus aureus (8.1 X 10(7)/ml), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (3.2 X 10(5)/ml) under stirring in sterilized physiological saline at 37 degrees C, 99% of the viable cells of these bacteria were removed in 2 to 6 h. When suspensions of these bacteria (10(5) to 10(8) cells per ml) were passed through a column (20 mm by 100 cm) of cross-linked poly(N-benzyl-4-vinylpyridinium bromide) at 37 degrees C with a flow rate of 0.8 to 1.4 bed volumes per h, 97 to 100% of the viable cells were eliminated from the suspensions during the treatment. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that cross-linked poly(vinylpyridinium halide) irreversibly captured these bacteria alive during the treatment. That is, total organic carbon was removed during the treatment, and the bacteria which adhered to the resin proliferated on the bacterial medium. The adhesion capacity was estimated to be 10(10) cells per g (dry weight). Total organic carbon was also removed even when the bacteria were killed by heat treatment before the column studies.

TI  - The feasibility of screening preschool children for urinary tract infection using dipslides.
AB  - Preschool children were screened for urinary tract infection (UTI) using Oxoid dipslides. A colony count of greater than 10(5) per ml was obtained from 64 out of 566 boys, and 58 out of 446 girls. A diagnosis of UTI was established in 3 boys, all aged 6 months or less, and 5 girls. No child was found to have either vesico-ureteric reflux (VUR) or renal scarring. False positive results were obtained in 15-17% of male and female infants and were attributable to the obligatory use of bag urine collection. These high rates preclude the use of this method in identifying UTI in preschool children on a wide scale.
TI  - [Comparative clinical efficacy of cephotaxim and cefuroxime against the pathogens of inflammation in obstetrics and gynecology].
AB  - The use of cephotaxim in the treatment of obstetric and gynecological patients with various infectious complications, as well as in the treatment of newborn infants in the Department of Intensive Therapy showed it to be highly effective in 100 per cent of the cases. The adverse reactions of cephotaxim were observed in 1 out of 43 patients. It should be noted that cephotaxim did not inhibit the host anaerobic indigenous flora. No cases of dysbacteriosis were recorded. Comparative analysis of the data on determination of the MIC of cephotaxim and cephuroxim with respect to various species of opportunistic microorganisms demonstrated that cephuroxim was more active against Staph. aureus, while cephotaxim against Klebsiella. Cephotaxim displayed activity against part of the strains of Ps. aeruginosa and streptococci of group D, which was not common to cephalosporins of the previous generations.
TI  - Norfloxacin (MK-0366, AM-715): in vitro activity and cross-resistance with other  organic acids including quality control limits for disk diffusion testing.
AB  - Norfloxacin is a new organic acid antimicrobic with an expanded spectrum that includes Staphylococcus spp, most Pseudomonas spp, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus ssp anitratus, some streptococci, as well as nearly all enteric bacilli. The drug appears to be bactericidal. Its expanded spectrum suggests that it should be tested separately by disk diffusion or other susceptibility testing methods. Tentative norfloxacin disk test quality control limits were derived from the results of a multi-laboratory study: Escherichia coli, 28-36 mm; S. aureus, 17-28 mm, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 22-29 mm.
TI  - Single-strain regression analysis for determination of interpretive breakpoints for cefoperazone disk diffusion susceptibility testing.
AB  - A novel approach for setting interpretive breakpoints in disk diffusion antibiotic susceptibility testing according to determined minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) limits is described, using the method of single-strain regression analysis. The procedure was tested on reference strains Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923), Streptococcus faecalis (ATCC 29212), Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853), using published results from cefoperazone disk diffusion experiments. The correlation between logarithm of the disk content and inhibition zone diameter squared was linear, excluding three endpoint values. When constants A and B in the new regression line equation were calculated for the four strains, all four showed different regression lines. Zone diameters corresponding to various MICs were calculated for a disk content of 75 micrograms. The values obtained for the four strains were 20.1, 20.9, 24.9, and 25.8 mm, respectively, for an MIC of 16 micrograms/ml, and 15.7, 15.7, 22.3, and 17.9 mm, respectively, for an MIC of 64 micrograms/ml. The following zone diameter breakpoints were determined for the "I" (intermediate) category, using a 75-micrograms disk: S. aureus, 18 to 15 mm; S. faecalis, 23 to 13 mm; E. coli, 20 to 17 mm; and P. aeruginosa, 20 to 17 mm.
TI  - Aminoglycoside accumulation by membrane vesicles of Escherichia coli and Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - Transport of nine aminoglycosides was studied in right side out as well as inside out membrane vesicles derived from aerobically or anaerobically grown E. coli and S. faecalis. Right side out membrane vesicles prepared from aerobically grown E. coli and inside out membrane vesicles prepared from aerobically grown S. faecalis as well as inside out vesicles prepared from anaerobically grown E. coli took up all the aminoglycosides tested whereas right side out vesicles prepared from anaerobically grown E. coli did not exhibit an aminoglycoside transport. Addition of DCCD to vesicles having accumulated aminoglycosides caused an efflux of the substrates from the vesicles. Monitoring of ATP levels in E. coli transporting aminoglycosides revealed that ATP synthesis and aminoglycoside transport were closely interrelated. Based on these data it seems likely that aminoglycoside transport may be closely linked to the direction of proton fluxes catalysed by the ATP'ase.
TI  - [Fundamental and clinical studies on T-1982 (cefbuperazone) in the field of obstetrics and gynecology].
AB  - T-1982 (cefbuperazone), a new cephamycin antibiotic, was fundamentally and clinically studied in the field of obstetrics and gynecology. The following results were obtained. The concentrations of T-1982 in arterial and venous blood and genitalia following intravenous injection were measured. The results demonstrated favourable transfer of the drug into various internal genital organs. T-1982 was administered to 12 patients. The efficacy rate was 75.0%, that is to say, good in 9 cases. No side effects were noted in any cases. It is, therefore, presumed that T-1982 is a useful drug for the infectious diseases in the field of obstetrics and gynecology although the number of subjects was not so large in this study.
TI  - Increase in immunoglobulin M antibodies against gut bacteria during acute hepatitis A.
AB  - The marked increase in the total serum immunoglobulin M (IgM) is a characteristic feature of acute hepatitis A. To study the nature of this IgM, we assayed serial titers of IgM antibodies against various antigens during and after acute hepatitis A. The antibodies against blood group antigen remained unchanged throughout the observation period. Thus, the production or metabolism of IgM was not nonspecifically altered. The IgM antibody against hepatitis A antigen decreased and finally disappeared during convalescence as expected. However, its time course did not correlate quantitatively with the concentration of the total serum IgM. In contrast, IgM antibodies against gut bacteria Bacteroides fragilis and Streptococcus faecalis were considerably elevated in all patients at the onset of the disease, and they normalized similarly to the total IgM during convalescence. IgM antibodies against Escherichia coli were elevated only in some of the patients. The data suggest that the amount of IgM antibodies against gut bacteria contributes significantly to the increase in the total serum IgM in acute hepatitis A.

AB  - The concentration of chlorhexidine digluconate required to kill Gram-negative bacteria which cause urinary tract infection associated with urethral catheterisation also damages the bladder mucosa. Increased bactericidal activity was obtained by the addition of a chelating agent (EDTA) and a buffer (Tris) enabling a low concentration of chlorhexidine (0.01 per cent) to be effective against Escherichia coli NCTC 86, Pseudomonas aeruginosa NCTC 7650 Proteus mirabilis NCTC 8309 and Streptococcus faecalis NCTC 8213. The type of fluid in which the bacteria were suspended affected the time required to achieve 99.9 per cent killing. The 0.01 per cent chlorhexidine solution with added EDTA and Tris did not cause severe erosive damage to the bladder mucosa of rats. The potential of this solution for use as a skin antiseptic prior to catheterisation and as a bladder instillation after catheterisation is discussed.

AB  - The survival of natural populations of Escherichia coli and enterococci in sewage was measured in large-volume diffusion chambers in an estuary and a salt marsh. The 5-liter chambers, with polycarbonate membrane sidewalls, were found to be suitable for up to week-long experiments. Decay rates, measured monthly from February to August 1978, ranged from 0.042 to 0.088 h(-1) (time for 90% of the population to die = 25 to 55 h) for E. coli and 0.019 to 0.083 h(-1) (time for 90% of the population to die = 29 to 122 h) for enterococci and were significantly correlated with temperature. In contrast to the diffusion culture experiments, the decay of E. coli in batch culture did not correlate with temperature. Enterococci survived longer than E. coli in the Narragansett Bay (estuary) experiments, but survived less well in the more eutrophic salt marsh. The effect of light on survival was examined with light/dark experiments and sampling at frequent intervals over the diel cycle. Diel changes in survival were not evident in the Narragansett Bay experiments. E. coli, however, exhibited a diel pattern of growth during the day and death at night in the salt marsh. There was no significant difference in decay rates between light and dark diffusion chambers, nor were decay rates correlated with light intensity. In concurrent batch experiments, survival was significantly greater in the dark for both organisms. These results suggest that the effect of light is complex and that conditions in batch culture may modify the survival of enteric bacteria. Observations made in diffusion chambers may more closely follow the in situ survival of enteric microorganisms.
TI  - Effect of cadmium and zinc on microbial adherence.
AB  - A study has been made of the effect of cadmium chloride and zinc acetate on the adherence of Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli and Candida albicans to buccal cells from man. Cadmium led to a significant decrease in the adherence of the three microorganisms tested. Zinc increased the adherence of S. faecalis and E. coli. These alterations in adherence were suppressed by chelating agents. S. faecalis grown in the presence of zinc or cadmium exhibited a decrease in adhesiveness. Pre-incubation of organisms with zinc interfered with the inhibitory effect of cadmium.
TI  - [Stimulation of the natural self-purification of soil].
AB  - Connected with the elaboration of the sanitary norm of cadmium in soil were performed examinations to appoint the self-purification index. This index is the highest permissible concentration of a noxious chemical substance in soil not yet injuring irreversible the process of natural self-purification. As criterions of the self-purification were selected normal and potential respiration, quantity of bacteria, actinomyceta, fungi, proteolytic, nitrifying, and cellulolytic micro-organisms, inhibition of Bacillus subtilis and Phormidium autumnale, survival and increasing ability of Escherichia coli, Streptococcus faecalis and Salmonella give. Among the influence of various concentrations of cadmium was find out the self-purification index of 500 mg Cd++/kg. By experience are offered methodical improvements at the elaboration of self-purification indices.
TI  - Application of S. faecalis and E. coli oral vaccines in humans and animals.
AB  - Vaccines of non-pathogenic intestinal bacteria for oral administration have been  used in the therapy of chronic and recurrent infections by the German Medical Association for Microbiological Therapy for over three decades. Three different oral bacterial vaccines were used in particular: 1. A sterile autolysate of non-pathogenic S. faecalis and E. coli; 2. a viable non-pathogenic S. faecalis vaccine, and; 3. a viable non-pathogenic E. coli vaccine. Clinical studies indicate the safety and efficacy of these bacterial products, and suggest the stimulation of immune activities and competitive capacities of S. faecalis and E. coli as mode of action. In animal experiments, orally administered intestinal bacterial vaccines enhance the resistance of mice against subsequent challenge with lethal doses of Salmonella typhimurium and Haemophilus influenzae. Mice were allowed access to a viable suspension of either S. faecalis or E. coli for at least 3 weeks. They were then challenged with either of the two unrelated pathogens. Both pre-treatment procedures conferred significant protection of the animals. The mechanism of this protective action appears to involve modification of white blood cell kinetics in the mice. The peritoneal resident cell population in mice is significantly increased by S. faecalis treatment.
TI  - [In vitro study of the lipase activity of bacterial strains isolated from the rabbit cecum on C14-labeled triolein].
AB  - The lipase activity of bacterial species isolated from the caecum of conventional rabbits was studied by means of two groups of tests: (1) bacteriologic isolation and an identification of nine aerobic and anaerobic clones and (2) incubation of each of these clones in the appropriate medium in the presence of labelled triolein (oleyl 1-14C), a biochemical analysis of the radioactivity of the fractions obtained. The main results can be expressed in the following way: maximum hydrolysis of glycerides is achieved by two species: Bacillus licheniformis and Clostridium sporogenes. The reaction is proportional to the incubation time for incubations of less than 8 h. The release of fatty acids is concomitant to the synthesis of phospholipids and of fatty acid methyl esters.
TI  - Bacterial survival and association with sludge flocs during aerobic and anaerobic digestion of wastewater sludge under laboratory conditions.
AB  - The fate of indicator bacteria, a bacterial pathogen, and total aerobic bacteria  during aerobic and anaerobic digestion of wastewater sludge under laboratory conditions was determined. Correlation coefficients were calculated between physical and chemical parameters (temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, total solids, and volatile solids) and either the daily change in bacterial numbers or the percentage of bacteria in the supernatant. The major factor influencing survival of Salmonella typhimurium and indicator bacteria during aerobic digestion was the temperature of sludge digestion. At 28 degrees C with greater than 4 mg of dissolved oxygen per liter, the daily change in numbers of these bacteria was approximately -1.0 log10/ml. At 6 degrees C, the daily change was less than -0.3 log10/ml. Most of the bacteria were associated with the sludge flocs during aerobic digestion of sludge at 28 degrees C with greater than 2.4 mg of dissolved oxygen per liter. Lowering the temperature or the amount of dissolved oxygen decreased the fraction of bacteria associated with the flocs and increased the fraction found in the supernatant.

TI  - Analysis of a single reference strain for determination of gentamicin regression  line constants and inhibition zone diameter breakpoints in quality control of disk diffusion antibiotic susceptibility testing.
AB  - An equation was derived from known formulas to express the size of the inhibition zone diameter in the disk diffusion antibiotic susceptibility test as a function of the disk content of antibiotic. The equation permitted a calculation of regression line constants for the correlation between zone diameter and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) with a single reference strain. Analysis of reference strains Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, as well as 12 clinical isolates belonging to these species, showed a linearity between zone size squared and the logarithm of disk content in tests with 10-, 30-, and 100-micrograms gentamicin disks. All three species, however, gave regression line constants which were characteristic for the individual bacterial species. Calculations of zone diameter breakpoints corresponding to recommended MIC limits with E. coli and P. aeruginosa reference strains gave an accurate prediction of gentamicin susceptibility. Histogram analysis of 48 strains of Streptococcus faecalis from clinical specimens showed a distribution of zone diameter values which would result in false classification of susceptibility with breakpoints calculated for the other bacterial species studied. Single reference strain analysis of S. faecalis ATCC 29212 (gentamicin MIC, 8 micrograms/ml) permitted the calculation of breakpoints which accurately assigned the strains tested to the intermediate category of susceptibility. Single reference strain analysis offers a quality control method for individual laboratories that allows the determination of inhibition zone diameter breakpoints corresponding to recommended MIC limits with no MIC determinations required.
TI  - [Laboratory and clinical studies of cefmenoxime in pediatric infections].
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of cefmenoxime (CMX) against clinical isolated organisms was measured; CMX was more active than cefotiam and cefazolin against Escherichia coli and Haemophilus influenzae. The serum concentrations of CMX following intravenous injection of 20 mg/kg were 25.6, 10.3, 3.0 micrograms/ml at 30, 60, 120 minutes after injection, respectively. CMX was excreted 60.9% in urine within 6 hours after injection. CMX was administered clinically to 22 pediatric patients with various infections (respiratory tract infection 16 including 1 pyothorax, urinary tract infection 4, tonsillitis with sinusitis 2) at the dose of 39 approximately 96 mg/kg/day for 4 approximately 9 days, and the following satisfactory results were obtained; excellent in 11, good in 9, and poor in 2. The rate of satisfactory clinical response was 90.9%. Eosinophilia 2 cases, slight elevation of transaminase 3 cases, slight elevation of BUN 1 case and transient diarrhea 1 case were observed. But no other serious side effects were observed.

TI  - Effect of beta-lactam antibiotics of the resistance of the digestive tract of mice to colonization.
AB  - Four broad-spectrum antibiotics-azlocillin, mezlocillin, cefuroxime, and moxalactam - were injected subcutaneously into mice twice a day. The animals divided into treatment groups for each antibiotic and then into subgroups, each subgroup receiving a different dose of antibiotic. The effect of treatment on the resistance of the digestive tract to colonization and the effect of treatment on endogenous gram-negative and intestinal streptococcal flora was studied: resistance to colonization decreased during treatment with approximately 0.9 mg of antibiotic per mouse per day. During treatment with this dose or a higher dose, Escherichia coli or a strain of Enterobacter resistant to the antibiotic being used grew to significantly higher numbers per gram of feces than in the control groups. The resistance of the digestive tract to colonization in mice decreases during systemic treatment with all four antibiotics at or above certain dose levels, a result also likely to occur in humans.
TI  - A comparison of the antibacterial activities of N-formimidoyl thienamycin (MK0787) with those of other recently developed beta-lactam derivatives.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of N-formimidoyl thienamycin (MK0787) was evaluated in 335 clinical isolates of ampicillin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, 50 Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, 28 Acinetobacter spp., 50 Streptococcus faecalis strains, and 7 oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains and was compared with the recently developed beta-lactam antibiotics mezlocillin, cefuroxime, cefazedone, cefoperazone, cefotaxime, and moxalactam. Among the gram-negative bacteria, N-formimidoyl thienamycin was less active than cefotaxime against Klebsiella, Serratia, and Proteus spp. but had comparable activity against Escherichia coli and Enterobacter strains. Activity of the thienamycin derivative was somewhat lower than that of moxalactam against most of the strains and superior to that of mezlocillin, cefuroxime, and cefoperazone. Moreover, N-formimidoyl thienamycin was the most active drug against P. aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. and had activity comparable to that of ampicillin against Streptococcus faecalis. N-Formimidoyl thienamycin was bactericidal at concentrations less than twice the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) in all gram-negative isolates tested. Oxacillin-resistant staphylococci (MIC of oxacillin, greater than 4 micrograms/ml) were inhibited at low concentrations of the thienamycin derivative (90% MIC, 0.25 micrograms/ml); however, N-formimidoyl thienamycin was not bactericidal at the 90% MIC. The antibacterial activity of N-formimidoyl thienamycin against all of the gram-negative bacilli was observed to be independent of beta-lactamase production.
TI  - A comparison of the levels of faecal indicator bacteria in water and human faeces in a rural area of a tropical developing country (Sierra Leone).
AB  - The levels of faecal coliforms (FC), indole-positive FC (presumptive Escherichia  coli), faecal streptococci (FS), Streptococcus faecalis and Clostridium perfringens in the natural water sources used by 29 rural settlements in Sierra Leone were investigated. Levels of the same indicators in human faeces were also investigated. The incidence of Salmonella spp. in both habitats and the temperature, pH and conductivity of water sources were also recorded. All water sources were contaminated with the indicator bacteria, mean numbers of which occurred in the relationship FC greater than presumptive E. coli congruent to FS congruent to C. perfringens greater than S. faecalis. FC were also predominant in human faeces, the relationship of means being FC congruent to presumptive E. coli greater than FS greater S. faecalis greater than C. perfringens. The need for confirmation of FC counts obtained from water sources was indicated by the large number of positive tubes produced in the FC multiple-tube dilution test from some samples which could not be confirmed as presumptive E. coli. Salmonella spp. Were isolated from 13 water sources and 6% of faecal samples. Mean water temperature was high (26.2 degrees C), pH low (5.04) and conductivity low (34 microS cm-1). Presumptive E. coli was considered the most appropriate indicator of faecal pollution of the types of water investigated.
TI  - Comparative synergistic activity of netilmicin-piperacillin versus gentamicin-piperacillin.
AB  - The synergistic action of the combination netilmicin-piperacillin in comparison to gentamicin-piperacillin was studied in 206 clinical isolates of staphylococci, enterococci, Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa by means of the checkerboard technique. Overall, netilmicin-piperacillin acted synergistically against 31% and gentamicin-piperacillin against 14% of the 206 strains. In particular, synergism was more frequently observed with netilmicin-piperacillin against Escherichia coli, Citrobacter spp., indole-positive Proteus spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Synergy was uncommon with either combination against enterococci, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Serratia spp. Only partial synergy or indifference was seen with both combinations against Klebsiella spp. The interaction of netilmicin would appear to be superior to that of gentamicin in combination with piperacillin.

TI  - The pH of ascitic fluid in the diagnosis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in  alcoholic cirrhosis.
AB  - Fifty-six patients with alcoholic cirrhosis and ascites were studied. The ascitic fluid was analyzed for pH, PO2, PCO2 glucose, protein, specific gravity, amylase, lactic dehydrogenase, white blood cell count, polymorphonuclear count, and cytology. It was also cultured aerobically and anaerobically. Simultaneously, arterial blood was analyzed for pH, PO2, and PCO2. Venous blood was analyzed for complete blood count, protein, aspartate transaminase, and it was also cultured under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Six patients had spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), i.e., culture was positive for Escherichia coli in five and Streptococcus faecalis in one. The mean (+/- S.E.) ascitic fluid pH in the SBP group wa 7.25 +/- 0.06 with a range of 7.12 to 7.31, while the ascitic fluid pH in the group with sterile ascites was 7.47 +/- 0.07 with a range of 7.39 to 7.58. The pH of the blood in both groups was 7.47 +/- 0.03. The pH of the ascites in the SBP group was significantly different from the pH in the group with sterile ascites, p less than 0.001. It was also significantly different from the blood pH, p less than 0.001. Highly significant inverse correlations existed between the ascitic pH in the SBP group and the ascitic white blood cell count (r = 0.84, p less than 0.01) and between the ascite pH in the SBP group and the ascitic polymorphonuclear count (r = -0.87 ,p less than 0.01). The ascitic fluid pH is recommended as an easy, quick, sensitive, and specific means of diagnosing SBP and it overcomes the problem of the present SBP diagnostic methods of utilizing an absolute white blood cell count greater than 500 per mm3 or a polymorphonuclear count greater than 250 per mm3 in which false positive interpretations occur.
TI  - HPr proteins of different microorganisms studied by hydrogen-1 high-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance: similarities of structures and mechanisms.
AB  - The HPr proteins of Streptococcus lactis, Streptococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis, and Escherichia coli were studied by 1H NMR at 360 MHz. The "active-center" histidines of all HPr proteins are characterized by a low pK value between 5.6 and 6.1 and similar spectral parameters. Phosphorylation of the histidyl residues leads to an increase of the pK value of 2-3 units and spectral changes characteristic for N-1 phosphorylation of the histidyl ring. The spectra of the HPr proteins of S. lactis, S. Faecalis, B. subtilis, and Staphylococcus aureus reveal many similarities, whereas the spectrum of the E. coli protein is different with exception of the active-center histidine. The HPr protein of S. lactis is formylated at its terminal amino group.

TI  - Microcystis aeruginosa toxin: cell culture toxicity, hemolysis, and mutagenicity  assays.
AB  - Crude toxin was prepared by lyophilization and extraction of toxic Microcystis aeruginosa from four natural sources and a unicellular laboratory culture. The responses of cultures of liver (Mahlavu and PCL/PRF/5), lung (MRC-5), cervix (HeLa), ovary (CHO-K1), and kidney (BGM, MA-104, and Vero) cell lines to these preparations did not differ significantly from one another, indicating that toxicity was not specific for liver cells. The results of a trypan blue staining test showed that the toxin disrupted cell membrane permeability within a few minutes. Human, mouse, rat, sheep, and Muscovy duck erythrocytes were also lysed within a few minutes. Hemolysis was temperature dependent, and the reaction seemed to follow first-order kinetics. Escherichia coli, Streptococcus faecalis, and Tetrahymena pyriformis were not significantly affected by the toxin. The toxin yielded negative results in Ames/Salmonella mutagenicity assays. Microtiter cell culture, trypan blue, and hemolysis assays for Microcystis toxin are described. The effect of the toxin on mammalian cell cultures was characterized by extensive disintegration of cells and was distinguishable from the effects of E. coli enterotoxin, toxic chemicals, and pesticides. A possible reason for the acute lethal effect of Microcystis toxin, based on cytolytic activity, is discussed.

AB  - Polyglycolic acid sutures were incubated at 37 degrees C in broth, and in 0.22 mu millipore filtered human urine infected with Escherichia coli, Str. faecalis, Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. At 3 days the Proteus had destroyed the polyglycolic acid sutures in the urine but not in the broth. None of the other organisms had any effect on the tensile strength of the suture material. Under the scanning electron microscope the Proteus-destroyed polyglycolic acid sutures showed multiple transverse microfractures. Polyglycolic acid sutures should not be used for closing urothelium in patients with a proven Proteus infection.

TI  - Membrane stimulation and intracellular killing by monocytes.
AB  - The present paper reviews our recent studies concerning the intracellular killing of bacteria by human monocytes and compares the results with those found for circulating granulocytes. The findings show that optimal intracellular killing of catalase-positive and catalase-negative bacteria is only reached during interaction of the Fc part of IgG and complement component C3b with their specific receptors in the membrane of the phagocytes. Similar stimulation was found during interaction of plant lectins and their specific sugar moieties in the cell membrane. The studies permit the general conclusion that optimal intracellular killing of micro-organisms requires membrane stimulation, which occurs after triggering of certain receptors.
TI  - Anatomical and immunological responses of rabbit gallbladders to bacterial infections.
AB  - To study the sequential morphological and immunological response of the rabbit gallbladder to bacterial infection and to compare the inflammatory responses with different pathogens, gallbladders were infected with Streptococcus faecalis and two strains of Escherichia coli, one of which produced enterotoxin. Gallbladder infection was produced either by intravenously injecting bacteria into rabbits with a small liver infarct or by injecting bacteria directly into the gallbladder of normal rabbits. The percentage of gallbladders infected intravenously with a nonenterotoxigenic E. coli strain was 86% at 1 week, 70% at 3 weeks, and 15% at 6 weeks. Epithelial necrosis and leukocyte infiltration were prominent 1 week after infection. At 3 and 6 weeks after infection, there was crypt distortion and increased mucus secretion in the epithelium as shown by periodic acid-Schiff staining. The lamina propria was infiltrated with mononuclear cells, many of which were plasma cells. Myofibroblasts (contractile fibroblasts) were also identified on transmission microscopy, In addition to these changes, toxigenic E. coli produced subepithelial capillary dilation in the villus core. Morphological changes (excluding toxin-associated changes) were related to the duration of infection rather than to the specific species of infecting bacteria. Infected gallbladders studied by immunofluorescence had a greater than 50-fold increase in plasma cells compared with control cells. In addition, the number increased with the duration of infection. Immunoglobulin A cells were the major cell type in gallbladders infected by intravesical injection, whereas immunoglobulin G cells predominated in gallbladders infected intravenously. The gallbladder appears to mount a local immune response to bacterial infection.

AB  - The antifungal activity was investigated in culture filtrates of 131 strains (41  genera and 104 species) of Ascomycetes--Discomycetes by testing against 6 fungal species which caused diseases in man. The anti-fungal spectrum was established for a Ciboria rufo-fusca strain, the only one found to inhibit all test organisms. This strain was also active against several gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Influence of Escherichia coli on Streptococcus faecalis in mixed cultures and experimental animal infections.
AB  - Strains of Escherichia coli (four strains) and Streptococcus faecalis (three strains) randomly isolated from faecal samples were cultured together in vitro and in experimental animal infections in order to evaluate the interaction of these two species. Streptococcus faecalis was eliminated from mixed cultures and infections at population ratios of Escherichia coli to Streptococcus faecalis of 10-100:1. The mechanism involved was probably an antibiotic substance produced by Escherichia coli which was antagonistic to Streptococcus faecalis. The substance appeared to be diffusible, water-soluble, of low molecular weight and insensitive to the protease trypsin. It was produced and remained active in vitro and in vivo and can probably be classified as a microcin.
TI  - Dietary fibre, bacterial metabolism and toxicity of nitrate in the rat.
AB  - 1. A semi-synthetic diet, the semi-synthetic diet plus pectin, and a stock diet were fed to rats, and three metabolic functions of the caecal bacteria (reduction of amaranth, p-nitrobenzoic acid and nitrate) were measured in vitro. 2. No consistent differences were noted between diets for the reduction of amaranth and p-nitrobenzoic acid. 3. No consistent differences in nitrate reductase activity were noted for rats maintained on a stock diet or a fibre-free diet. However, the addition of 5% pectin to the latter diet resulted in a several-fold increase in nitrite production. 4. This increased nitrite production in vitro was associated with methaemoglobinaemia following the oral administration of nitrate to rats fed the diet containing pectin. Animals receiving the basal fibre-free diet were unaffected by nitrate.

The patient series was predominantly geriatric, with a mean age of 70.9 years and including 17 patients over 75 years. Nine had an in-dwelling catheter and azotaemia was found in 14 cases. In this clinically difficult group, a positive bacteriological response to treatment was obtained in 72.9% and, if patients with in-dwelling catheters are excluded, 90% were cured. Ceftazidime-resistant Streptococcus faecalis was cultured before treatment in 6 of the 8 unsuccessful cases. In the remaining 2 treatment failures, Streptococcus faecalis was isolated immediately after treatment. In terms of clinical response to therapy all patients were cured or improved. Treatment with ceftazidime was well tolerated. No subjective side-effects occurred. One patient developed a distinct but transient elevation of liver enzymes, and in 2 cases a negative direct Coombs test was temporarily positive.
TI  - Quantitative bacteriological analysis of amniotic fluid.
AB  - Quantitative bacteriological analysis of amniotic fluid (AF) was performed on 60  fluid samples collected by catheter from 50 selected labor patients regarded as liable to infection. AF cultures were positive in 52 cases. The bacterial colony counts ranged from less than 10(2) colony-forming units (CFU) per milliliter to 10(9) CFU/ml. Pathogenic bacteria in neonates such as group B Streptococcus, Escherichia coli, and Listeria monocytogenes were encountered with numerations equal to or greater than 10(7) CFU/ml in groups with clinical findings. An excellent correlation was noted between bacterial counts in AF and clinical data (p less than 0.00006). The results confirm that the quantitative bacteria analysis of the AF is a useful tool for evaluation of an infection risk for neonates.
TI  - The screening of four aminoglycosides in the selective decontamination of the digestive tract in mice.
AB  - The suppressive effect of amikacin, gentamicin, tobramycin and paromomycin on the aerobic endogenous flora and on the colonization resistance of the digestive tract was tested by administering one of the antibiotics orally at five different dose levels. At a certain dose level, all antibiotics suppressed the endogenous Enterobacteriaceae species. Amikacin was particularly effective in this respect. Low doses of amikacin rapidly destroyed the colonization resistance. This resistance only remained unaffected in animals treated with tobramycin in doses that were still adequate to completely suppress the endogenous Enterobacteriaceae species. We concluded that of all the antibiotics tested in this study, only tobramycin may have a future in (clinical) application for the selective decontamination of the digestive tract. Selective decontamination can be considered an effective method for infection prevention in leukopenic patients.

The suppression of immunogenesis has been found to be most pronounced in patients having ATI mixed according to agglutinin titers to the autostrains of infective agents. The features of serological shifts in mixed ATI should be taken into consideration in evaluating the diagnostic significance of this reaction in the time course of the disease.

TI  - Salt extends the upper temperature limit for growth of food-poisoning bacteria.
AB  - Inclusion of NaCl into the growth medium raised the upper temperature limit of growth of the following organisms: Staphylococcus aureus (two strains), Salmonella senftenberg, S. typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus faecalis, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium sporogenes, C. perfringens (two strains). The magnitude of the response varied with the culture, the largest being 3.5 degrees with B. cereus cells. The spores of B. cereus were not protected by salt but clostridial spores behaved as the vegetative cells (response of 2.5 degrees). The optimal salt concentration for the protective effect varied with the organism ranging from 0.2 M for the Gram-negative organisms to 1.0 M for S. aureus.
TI  - Interconversion of components of the bacterial proton motive force by electrogenic potassium transport.
AB  - The influence of K+ ions on the components of the transmembrane proton motive force (delta mu H+) in intact bacteria was investigated. In K+-depleted cells of the glycolytic bacterium STreptococcus faecalis the addition of K+ ions caused a depolarization of the membrane by about 60 mV. However, since the depolarization was compensated for by an increase in the transmembrane pH gradient (delta pH), the total proton motive force remained almost constant at about 120 mV. Half-maximal changes in the potential were observed at K+ concentrations at which the cells accumulated K+ ions extensively. In EDTA-treated, K+-depleted cells of Escherichia coli K-12, the addition of K+ ions to the medium caused similar, although smaller changes in the components of delta mu H+. Experiments with various E. coli K-12 K+ transport mutants showed that for the observed potential changes the cells required either a functional TrkA or Kdp K+ transport system. These data are interpreted to mean that the inward movement of K+ ions via each of these bacterial transport systems is electrogenic. Consequently, it leads to a depolarization of the membrane, which in its turn allows the cell to pump more protons into the medium.
TI  - [Causes of the antibacterial action of amniotic fluid (author's transl)].
AB  - The activity of E. coli, Group B Streptococci, Strept. faecalis, Stap. epidermidis and Staph. aureus in human amniotic fluid was studied. In comparison to Standard I broth an inhibited growth of test organisms was observed. The bacteriostatic effect of amniotic fluid was most significant with Staph. epidermidis. We further investigated the causes for this bacterial growth inhibition with Staph. epidermidis. We showed that it is independent from the initial number of bacteria as well as from zinc and phosphate content, the phosphate-to-zinc ratio and from the protein content in amniotic fluid samples. It could neither be influenced by heating nor by autoclaving, but was immediately lost by adding Standard I both to amniotic fluid samples. In the concentrations we investigated the bacteriostatic effect was independent from the influence of steroid hormones.
TI  - Effects of physiologic variations in temperature on the rate of antibiotic-induced bacterial killing.
AB  - The effects of physiologic temperature variations on antibiotic-induced killing of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae were studied. At concentrations less than or equal to four times the minimal bactericidal concentration, the activity of each of the antibiotics (gentamicin sulfate, sodium ampicillin, and chloramphenicol) against the test bacteria was influenced by changes in temperature. Only with S. pneumoniae did such influence appear to result directly from temperature-induced changes in the multiplication rate of the bacteria. Repeated subculturing of bacteria at 41 degrees C to induce temperature adaptation had a variable effect on the rate of bacterial killing by appropriate antibiotics. The magnitude of the effect of temperature on antibiotic-induced rates of bacterial killing varies with the antibiotic class, the species of bacteria, and the temperature to which bacteria have been adapted.
TI  - Factors affecting sperm motility. VI. Sperm viability under the influence of bacterial growth in human ejaculates.
AB  - The influence of bacterial growth on human sperm motility and viability was evaluated objectively with the multiple-exposure photography method. Experimental semen specimens, obtained from normal donors bh nonaseptic means of masturbation, were incubated with antibiotics at room temperature or body temperature for 24 hours. Although bacteria, grew in control specimens, were totally eradicated in all antibiotic-treated specimens, no significant difference was found between these groups with regard to sperm motility throughout the time of incubation. Sperm survival was not inhibited, nor was it extended as a result of suppression of bacterial growth. In both groups, survival time was much shorter in specimens incubated at body temperature than in those kept at room temperature. Sperm motility was not affected after 2 hours of incubation of fresh specimens with concentrations of various pathogenic bacteria similar to those found in severe prostatitis. The question of whether the use of antibiotics in the treatment of asthenospermia per se has a prognostic value is discussed.
TI  - Resistance of selected strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to low-intensity ultraviolet radiation.
AB  - The resistances of 10 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other microorganisms  to an ultraviolet (UV) intensity of 100 muW/cm2 were determined. Organisms were exposed in 2- or 15-ml saline suspensions contained in uncapped polyethylene bottles for increasing periods of time, and the surviving fractions were enumerated. Decimal reduction times were calculated by regression analysis, using the least-squares method. The 10 strains of P. aeruginosa, compared with Micrococcus radiodurans and Candida albicans, were very susceptible to low-intensity UV radiation. Results from this study showed that a UV intensity of 100 muW/cm2 penetrated saline suspensions up to 40 mm deep sufficiently to kill high levels of microbial cells, especially P. aeruginosa cells. These results allowed us to design a system for determining and monitoring the sterilization capability of low-intensity UV radiation. In our particular case, UV proved to be an efficient mode for sterilizing saline suspensions of P. aeruginosa in polyethylene bottles. The significance and application of these findings with regard to supporting UV as a sterilant are discussed.

TI  - Active transport of Ca2+ in bacteria: bioenergetics and function.
AB  - The bioenergetics of Ca2+ transport in bacteria are discussed with special emphasis on the interrelationship between transport and other cellular functions such as substrate oxidation by the respiratory chain and oxidative phosphorylation. The unusual polarity of Ca2+ movement provides an exceptional tool to compare active transport and other ATP requiring or generating processes since this ion is actively taken up by everted vesicles in which the coupling-factor ATPase is exposed to the external medium. As inferred from studies with everted vesicles, the active extrusion of Ca2+ by whole cells can be accomplished by substrate driven respiration, hydrolysis of ATP or as in the case of Streptococcus faecalis by a nonhydrolytic unknown process which involves ATP directly. Substrate oxidation and the hydrolysis of ATP result in the generation of a pH gradient which can energize the Ca2+ uptake directly (Ca2+/H+ antiport) or via a secondary Na+ gradient (Ca2+/Na+ antiport). In contrast to exponentially growing cells sporulating Bacilli accumulate Ca2+ during the synthesis of dipicolinic acid. Studies involving Ca2+ transport provided evidence in support of the hypothesis that the Mg2+ ATPase from Escherichia coli not only provides the driving force for various cellular functions but exerts a regulatory role by controlling the permeability of the membrane to protons. The different specificity requirements of various naphthoquinone analogs in the restoration of transport or oxidative phosphorylation, after the natural menaquinone has been destroyed by irradiation, has indicated that a protonmotive force is sufficient to drive active transport. However, in addition to the driving force (protonmotive force) necessary to establish oxidative phosphorylation, a specific spatial orientation of the respiratory components, such as the naphthoquinones, is essential for the utilization of the proton gradient or membrane potential or both. Finally, evidence suggesting that intracellular Ca2+ levels might play a fundamental role in bacterial homeostasis is discussed, in particular the role of Ca2+ in the process of chemotaxis and in conferring bacteria heat stability. A vitamin K-dependent carboxylation reaction has been found in Escherichia coli which is similar to that reported in mammalian systems which results in gamma carboxylation of glutamate residues. Although all of the proteins containing gamma-carboxyglutamate described so far are involved in Ca2+ metabolism, the role of these proteins in Escherichia coli is unknown and remains to be elucidated.

TI  - [Effects of cefotaxime on the intestinal bacterial ecosystem in children (author's transl)].
AB  - Cefotaxime activity was studied in pediatric practice on the intestinal bacteria  flora of 10 children, by means of a differential quantitative method for aerobic and anaerobic faecal flora and was compared to that of 41 controls not receiving any antibiotics. Cefotaxime was given alone in 7 children, and in combination with gentamicin in 3. An effect on the intestinal bacterial flora was noted on E. coli, which disappeared in 4 cases and diminished considerably in 5. A slight increase in Streptococcus D was observed without excessive multiplication of the flora. The study showed no significant alteration for the other aerobic or anaerobic bacilli. There was no selection of resistant organisms. Cefotaxime is a new cephalosporin which does not seem to produce an increase in many resistant pathogens due to a break-down of the barrier effect observed on the bacterial flora of the gut in children.
TI  - [In vitro studies on the activities of cephalothin against selected bacteria (author's transl)].
AB  - Cephalothin antimicrobial activities were studied against selected bacteria with  special reference to the time of exposure of microbes to the drug assessed in broth medium. The minimal concentration of this drug producing 10(0)-10(1) reduction of colony forming unit (CFU) per ml after given exposure times -an approximation to the theoretical bacteriostatic concentration inhibiting increase or decrease of CFU- was designated as minimally reducing concentration (MRC). The concentration was determined after 6 h, 18 h and 42 h of incubation and designated as 6-h, 18-h and 42-h MRC, respectively. Conventional minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) with 18 h exposure time was also studied. The minimal concentration of the drug yielding 99.9% reduction of CFU after an exposure to the drug was determined and designated as minimal lethal concentration (MLC). The determinations were made at 6 h, 18 h and 42 h of incubation and designated as 6-h, 18-h and 42-h MLC, respectively. The data indicated that the bacteriostatic concentration for Escherichia coli and Klebsiella sp. with brief exposure time (6-h MRC) was 2-4 times lower than the MIC. If the exposure time was prolonged (18-42 h), the bacteriostatic concentration increased and almost agreed with the MIC. A significant effect of inoculum size was observed on the MRC values for the Gram-negatives when the values were determined with the inoculum concentrations at 10(6)-10(7) CFU/ml and 10(3)-10(4) CFU/ml. In contrast to these Gram-negatives, the 6-h MRC for most strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus roughly agreed with the MIC. If the ratio of bacteriostatic to bactericidal concentrations was used as the criterion, the mode of action of cephalothin appeared to be bactericidal for most of the Gram-negatives. This drug was bacteriostatic for a number of the Gram-positive strains, in particular to those of Enterococcus, especially when microbes were exposed to the drug over a brief period of time.
TI  - [Quantitative study of the faecal flora of breast- or bottle-fed neonates (author's transl)].
AB  - A blind qualitative and quantitative study of the aerobic and anaerobic faecal flora of two groups of newborn babies was carried out. One group of babies was breast-fed, while the second group was bottle-fed. In both cases the first established bacterial flora was essentially made of Escherichia coli and group D Streptococci (S. faecalis or S. bovis). On the sixth day of life a difference between he bacterial flora of the two groups was noticed, Bifidobacterium spp. was more frequently observed in the breast-fed babies. However the number of Bifidobacterium was lower than the dominant flora.
TI  - In situ and laboratory studies of bacterial survival using a microporous membrane sandwich.
AB  - A new device and procedure for the study of bacterial survival in an aquatic environment are described. The device uses two appressed presterilized microporous membranes to expose a bacterial cell suspension to the environment at a cell concentration that closely resembles those levels found in natural aquatic ecosystems. The device has been used under laboratory controlled conditions and in situ to study and compare bacterial survival times. In laboratory studies, Escherichia coli and Streptococcus faecalis survived the longest at 12 degrees C, pH 5, and in the presence of iron or calcium ions and cysteine. Cells in mid-stationary growth phase survived longer than those in mid- or late-logarithmic phase, whereas those maintained for a year or more as stock cultures survived for shorter period of time than did recent environmental isolates. In situ studies indicate that 5% of the starting number of E. coli and S. faecalis cells may survive longer than 96 h at 16 degrees C in potable lake water, whereas survival times in polluted lake water were approximately 12 h.
TI  - Bactericidal concentrations of methylglyoxal produced by heated cells of Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - Cells of Streptococcus faecalis that survived heating for 21 min at 60 degrees C  were killed when resuspended at an initial cell density of about 1 X 10(8) viable units/mL and incubated at 33 degrees C for 24 h in a no-growth medium containing potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.1, glucose, and casein hydrolysate. When such heated cells were resuspended at an initial cell density of about 1 X 10(7) viable units/mL or lower, subsequent cell death was reduced at least 10 000-fold. Unheated cells incubated under similar conditions at about 1 X 10(8) and 1 X 10(9) viable units/mL did not die. Cell death was due to a toxic compound synthesized by the heated cells, and supernatants from incubations showing a bactericidal effect contained a component, absent in nonlethal supernatants, that reacted with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine. Thin-layer chromatography, mass spectrometer analysis, and the visible spectrum of the 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine derivative of the unknown and authentic methylglyoxal, and the positive response shown by the free unknown compound when used as a substrate for glyoxalase I, suggested that methylglyoxal was the bactericidal compound. Solutions of authentic methylglyoxal were bactericidal at concentrations above 0.2 mM and lethal supernatants contained about 1 mM methylglyoxal, whereas supernatants that were not lethal contained less than 0.02 mM methylglyoxal.
TI  - Aspects of the antibacterial action of diphenyliodonium chloride.
AB  - Diphenyliodonium chloride was found to be a broad spectrum antimicrobial agent and its activity was affected by pH and inoculum size. Its uptake by bacterial cells was Langmuirian, and it caused loss of intracellular material. Aerobic glucose metabolism and dehydrogenase activity were inhibited. Low concentrations of the drug affected the membrane-bound ATPase and K transport in Streptococcus faecalis.
TI  - Effect of metronidazole and sulfasalazine on the normal human faecal flora.
AB  - Nine healthy individuals were treated with metronidazole (Flagyl) for 2 weeks and sulfasalazine (Salazopyrin) for 2 further weeks or inversely after randomization. Before, at the day for cross-over, and the end of treatment, quantitative and qualitative studies of the aerobic and anaerobic faecal bacteria and plasma concentration studies of the drugs were performed. The total counts of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were in close agreement with those reported by others. A comparison between pretreatment samples and those taken at the end of treatment showed a significant or almost significant increase in the count of faecal streptococci (P = 0.03) and of Escherichia coli (P = 0.06) in subjects treated with metronidazole, but not with sulfasalazine. However, the changes in the anaerobic bacterial flora reported during treatment in patients with Crohn's disease with the same drugs were not observed among the healthy individuals.

TI  - Rapid diagnosis of infections caused by beta-lactamase-producing bacteria by means of an enzyme radioisotopic assay.
AB  - We developed a sensitive enzyme radioisotopic assay for the measurement of beta-lactamase, an enzyme produced by a number of pathogenic bacteria. This ERIA was 100-fold more sensitive than the commonly used iodometric or spectrophotometric assays for the measurement of beta-lactamase and, unlike these other assays, the ERIA was not significantly influenced by serum proteins or unlabeled penicillin. Clinical specimens consisting of blood, peritoneal, pleural, and cerebrospinal fluids from patients infected with beta-lactamase-producing organisms yielded positive ERIA tests; fluids from uninfected patients were negative. The ERIA takes approximately 90 minutes to perform, and offers great potential for the rapid diagnosis of serious bacterial infections caused by bacteria which produce beta-lactamase.
TI  - The bacteriological quality of minced beef in the U.K.
AB  - Minced (ground) beef from three supermarkets, three intermediate-sized chain butchers and three small family butchers in each of three geographical areas was examined three times in warm weather and three times in cool. The total viable count (37 and 20 degrees C), numbers of Enterobacteriaceae (37 and 17 degrees C), and presumptive coliforms did not differ significantly between shop type or season. Statistically significant differences in numbers of faecal Streptococci, Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium perfringens were too small to be of commercial importance, or diagnostic value.

AB  - An ultraviolet radiation-sensitive derivative of Streptococcus faecalis strain JH2-2 was isolated and found to be deficient in recombination, using a plasmid-plasmid recombination system. The strain was sensitive to chemical agents which interact with deoxyribonucleic acid and also underwent deoxyribonucleic acid degradation after ultraviolet irradiation. Thus, the mutant has properties similar to those of recA strains of Escherichia coli.
TI  - Bacterial effect of hydrogen peroxide on urinary tract pathogens.
AB  - Bacterial contamination of urinary drainage bags is a frequent source of bladder  bacteriuria in patients with indwelling catheters. Previous work demonstrated that the addition of 30 ml of 3% H2O2 prevented bacterial contamination of urinary drainage bags for up to 8 h in patients with urinary infections (greater than 10(5) colony-forming units per ml). Survival curves of a variety of organisms in filter-sterilized urine with various concentrations of H2O2 (0.6 to 0.01%) were constructed. Organisms with high cellular catalase activity (Staphylococcus aureus, Serratia marcescens, and Proteus mirabilis) required 30 to 60 min of exposure to 0.6% H2O2 for a reduction of 10(8) to less than 1 colony-forming unit per ml, whereas Escherichia coli, Streptococcus sp., and Pseudomonas sp. required only 15 min of exposure. The efficacy of H2O2 in urine was maintained despite exposure to room temperature for 5 days and reinoculation with bacterial suspensions. H2O2 is inexpensive and relatively nontoxic, and these data suggest that periodic instillation of H2O2 into urinary drainage bags may eliminate a source of bladder bacteriuria and environmental contamination.

The technique can permit isolation and enumeration of microorganisms from test samples of these foods as large as 5 g. Flow direction through the filter was an important factor in filterability of dairy products.
TI  - Bacterial inhibitory effects of nitrite: inhibition of active transport, but not  of group translocation, and of intracellular enzymes.
AB  - Nitrite inhibited active transport of proline in Escherichia coli but not group translocation of sugar via the phosphoenolpyruvate:phosphotransferase system. These results were consistent with previous results that nitrite inhibits active transport, oxygen uptake, and oxidative phosphorylation in aerobic bacteria. Nitrite also inhibited aldolase (EC 4.1.2.13) from E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus faecalis, and rabbit muscle. Thus, these various data showed that nitrite has more than one site of attack in the bacterial cell. These data also indicated that nitrite is inhibitory to a wide range of physiological types of bacteria.
TI  - [In-vitro efficacy of topical antibiotics on bacteria from burns].
AB  - The influence of topical antimicrobial agents on bacterial growth was determined  with an agar diffusion technique. 349 isolates were tested with mafenide acetate and silver sulfadiazine, 226 isolates were tested with povidone iodine. None of these agents was likewise effective against all organisms of the same bacterial strain. The inhibition of growth by mafenide acetate and silver sulfadiazine demonstrated dose-response. 26 to 40% of the tested grampositive cocci were inhibited by mafenide acetate, whereas the growth of about 26 to 90% of gramnegative rods was effected by silver sulfadiazine, with the exception of proteus species (9%). Both agents influenced the growth of pseudomonas (40 to 65%). The results obtained with povidone iodine led to the consideration that the agar diffusion method might not be suitable for testing this drug.
TI  - [Airborne microflora found in some stations of the metro in the Hungarian capital of Budapest (author's transl)].
AB  - Both the microflora and some physical parameters of the air in three underground  railway (metro) stations were analysed. The air samples taken in the first two stations contained considerably more microbes, namely three times as many, than the sample from station No. 3. In the samples from the first two stations both the pathogenic and anthropogenic germs occured more frequently than in the samples from the third station. The normal flora consisted of gram-positive cocci/Streptococci, Micrococci, Sarcina. Roughly 10 per cent of the microbes proved to be spore-formers. Selective investigations led to the detection of Staph. aureus, Enterococci, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichiae, Klebsiella and Proteus bacteria. The reason why the stations of line 2 were found to be contaminated to a greater degree is probably because of the higher passenger traffic, the smaller space, as well as the stronger airflow due to the artificial ventilation and the piston effect of the trains. The effect of the artificial environmental conditions on the staff of the metro company still needs further investigation. The effect on the passengers is considered to be less pronounced.
TI  - Antimicrobial effects of trimethoprim and sulphadiazine in infected urine and blood.
AB  - Sulphadiazine and trimethoprim in a wide range of concentrations were added to urine from patients with untreated urinary-tract infections. At therapeutic concentrations, the antibacterial activity of trimethoprim was not increased by the addition of sulphadiazine. Exposure of Escherichia coli to trimethoprim in urine was not associated with an increase in resistance to that agent. It was also not possible to select, in vitro, stable resistance to trimethoprim in sensitive cultures of E. coli. At therapeutic levels in blood, trimethoprim and sulphadiazine singly produced mainly a bactericidal action on pathogens responsible for urinary-tract infections. Sulphadiazine occasionally enhanced the effect of trimethoprim at subtherapeutic levels. These findings support the need for further evaluation of trimethoprim alone, rather than its use as a combination with a sulphonamide.
TI  - [Problems of maintaining hygienic and microbiological quality standards in the production of foodstuffs, particularly those of vegetable origin. Second report: Demands regarding hygiene and microbiology-theory is useless without practice (author's transl)].
AB  - Many legal regulations exist on the hygienic-microbiological properties of food products. The 'Lander-Speiseeisverordnungen' (County Ice Cream Regulations), the 'Diat-Verordnung' (Dietary Regulation) and the 'Trinkwasser-Verordnung' (Regulation on Potable Water) are examples for the frequent inadequacies inherent in these regulations. Caution is indicated against any new proposals for the establishment of additional hygienic-microbiological regulations without sufficient practice-related reasoning unless a revision and improvement of inadequate, already existing regulations has been carried out. Practicable procedures have to be prepared not only to maintain the hygiene in Catering facilities, but also for the evaluation of food products and raw materials according to hygienic-microbiological criteria: Although commonly assumed, the 'Microbe Counts' alone are not sufficient for the determination of the hygienic conditions. Therefore, inspite of all the weak points inherent in quality control procedures - e. g. possible sick, co-workers, only random sample control of raw material supplies - such adapted systems (good manufacturing practice) have to be enforced with special emphasis on the economy of the control expenditure, interdisciplinary aspects, governmental control and consumer information. Examples from literature and own experience demonstrate that the importance of the 'Fecal Indicators' for the judgement of 'hygienic conditions' in food production are rather limited and a correct evaluation only by 'Bacterial Plate Counts' is not possible due to the variation of germ density within one sample. Microbiological investigations of food products according to statistic rules require such an expenditure that they cannot generally be used as routine control procedures. A possible documentation is shown which allows - even without statistic investigations, at least retrospectively - the preparation of a survey on the microbiological properties of raw materials generally available on the market and which makes it possible to recognize and reject any unqualified microbiological limiting value requirements.

AB  - Disinfection of sewage from an activated sludge process, and of sewage from an activated sludge process followed by chemical precipitation, has given very high killing rates for the indicator organisms examined. For coliforms, Escherichia coli and faecal streptococci, a killing rate of more than 999.99% was usually obtained, and the residual number of microorganisms in the irradiated sewage was very low. The killing rate increased with the irradiation dosage, depending on the intensity of the irradiation, ie the water quality, and on the irradiation period, ie the water flow. The study demonstrates that ultraviolet irradiation may be an alternative method to chlorination of sewage.
TI  - The presence of antibody-coated anaerobic bacteria in asymptomatic bacteriuria during pregnancy.
AB  - Quantitative anaerobic culture of urine samples obtained from 593 pregnant women  by suprapubic bladder aspiration was performed to establish the involvement of anaerobic bacteria in asymptomatic urinary tract infections. The fluorescent antibody (FA) test was applied to the sediments of bladder aspirates to determine the site of infection. Anaerobic bacteriuria (greater than or equal to 10(4) microorganisms/ml of urine) was found in 34 patients, of whom five were FA-positive. These anaerobes were identified as Lactobacillus minutus, Veillonella parvula (two patients). Clostridium putrefaciens, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius. Aerobic bacteriuria (greater than 10(4) microorganisms/ml of urine) was detected in 27 patients, of whom 13 were FA-positive. In 10 women with mixed aerobic/anaerobic bacteriuria, no FA-positive bacteria were found. The finding of FA-positive anaerobes may indicate that these organisms are involved in silent renal infection.

The behaviour of 3 different initial colony counts in each case was examined. Colony forming units (CFU) were evaluated at the beginning and after 1, 2, 4, 6 and 24 h. CFU were reduced at Staph. aureus and E. coli in aqua bidest and tap water not earlier than after 4 h, but mostly after 24 h. In Strept. faecalis CFU were reduced in aqua bidest at 40 degrees C after 24 h, in tap water at 40 degrees C after 4 h, but there were no changes of CFU in both media at 20 degrees C or 30 degrees C. Ser. marcescens strains were growing in aqua bidest and tap water after 24 h at 20 degrees C. P. aeruginosa strains were reduced in aqua bidest at all temperatures but they were growing in tap water after 24 h. Reduction or growth of all strains did not depend on initial colony count during examination time, changing of CFU turned out to be quicker at 40 degrees C than at 20 degrees C. It is the conclusion that in humidifiers and nebulizers CFU will be different from initial colony count not earlier than after 6 h. Growth will be seen after 6 until 24 h if there are no particular nutritive organic compounds.

The frequency of isolation of virus in the bathing zone considered as healthy is very high. The concentration of virus is practically constant in the length of an axis, 200 m distant in comparison with the bank.--The increase of particles of virus in the sea, in the estuary of the emission, reflects in the same way in the bathing zone, 5 m away from the bank. The phenomenon of dilution of the effluent in the sea water doesn't seem to play a part.
TI  - The occurrence of Candida Albicans in Lake Ontario bathing beaches.
AB  - There are inherent weaknesses associated with currently used bacterial fecal pollution indicator systems. Fecal pollution indicator data would be more meaningful if supplemented with information relating to the occurrence of pathogens in recreational water. Through surveys of four bathing beaches on Lake Ontario, it was established that the opportunistically pathogenic yeast Candida albicans occurs in near shore waters. The beaches surveyed could be differentiated on the basis of bacterial fecal pollution indicator levels and numbers of the pathogens C. albicans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The occurrence of C. albicans and P. aeruginosa appeared to be related to elevated fecal pollution indicator levels. Maximum numbers of all parameters were observed in July and August in association with peak bather loads at the beaches. In only one instance does the data suggest that a beach was subjected to human fecal contamination.
TI  - Influence of neomycin and metronidazole on colonic microflora of volunteers.
AB  - The influence on colonic microflora of neomycin and metronidazole alone, or in combination, was studied in volunteers taking a normal diet. Bacterial counts on daily faecal samples revealed that metronidazole had no influence on anaerobic faecal bacteria. Neomycin on the other hand, was effective against sensitive aerobes. However, the combination of neomycin and metronidazole profoundly reduced both aerobic and bacteria. Assay of faecal antibiotic concentrations showed that neomycin achieved high intraluminal levels while metronidazole was undetectable or present at low concentrations.

The total adenine nucleotide content of dental plaque samples and of a pure culture of bacteria was determined and the adenylate energy charge calculated from this. When a pure culture of bacteria was killed with heat, the adenylate energy charge decreased exponentially with duration of treatment and corresponded with a decrease in the count of viable organisms.
TI  - Oropharyngeal microflora in Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australian children. An indicator of environmental contamination.
AB  - Faecal microorganisms, not normally resident in the oropharynx, were isolated much more often from Aboriginal than non-Aboriginal Australian children. This is almost certainly due to differences in standards of hygiene and living in these two groups, and is an important factor in contributing to the common and serious problem of gastrointestinal infections in young Aborigines. In the non-Aboriginal group, the isolations of faecal organisms were much more common from infants and from children under the age of two years when compared with older children; this is probably due to the readiness of spreading microorganisms from the gastrointestinal tract to the mouth in the younger children.

AB  - The survival times of Staph. aureus, Strept. faecalis, E. coli, Klebs. pneumoniae, Ser. marcescens and P. aeruginosa were found out on aluminium foil. It was examined whether there exists a dependence on the initial colony count and in mixed cultures a mutual influence of the several species of bacteria. The longest survival times were found among the grampositive cocci. Ser. marcescens and Klebs. pneumoniae could no more be indicated after 19 days in case of initial colony count of log 7.0/cm2; E. coli could no more be shown after 14 days. P. aeruginosa had the shortest survival time. The dependence on the initial colony count was ascertained in 3 different concentrations of bacteria. The highest concentrations showed the smallest reduction of cocci and the longest survival times of Enterobacteriaceae respectively. The middle and lowest initial colony counts showed quicker reduction or shorter survival times. Ser. marcescens was more resistant to drying than Klebs. pneumoniae. The quickest dying rates showed P. aeruginosa without any dependence on initial colony count. In mixed cultures with Staph. aureus or Strept. faecalis survival times of Enterobacteriaceae were longer; the same result gave Klebs. pneumoniae in culture together with Ser. marcescens. The following explanation might be possible: because of the drying resistance of grampositive cocci the total bacteria number in these mixed cultures after several days is higher than in monocultures of E. coli, Klebs. pneumoniae or Ser. marcescens. This protects the Enterobacteriaceae against external influences for a longer time. Therefore it is understandable that the effect increases with the length of duration. The same interpretation could apply to the mixed cultures of Klebs. pneumoniae/Ser. marcescens.
TI  - The effect of three frequently applied antibiotics on the colonization resistance of the digestive tract of mice.
AB  - The influence of treatment with increasing oral doses of three absorbable antibiotics on the colonization resistance of the digestive tract was investigated in mice. Mice treated with ampicillin or epicillin in any of the applied doses had a strongly decreased colonization resistance as demonstrated by 'bacterial overgrowth' after contamination with resistant strains of Escherichia coli. After a treatment period 2 weeks, Streptococcus faecalis became resistant in a number of animals. Oral treatment with cephradine on the other hand had no obvious influence on the endogenous flora of the mice, nor was the colonization resistance decreased.

AB  - The efficacy and tolerance of Cefazedon, a new antibiotic, was investigated clinically on 90 patients with urinary tract infections who also required surgical treatment. Good clinical results were achieved in over 90% of patients after 6 to 7 days of treatment. The bacteriological examination revealed complete elimination of the initially identified pathogens in 89 cases. No difference in treatment results could be established when applying the dose 2 or 3 times daily. On the third day of treatment skin reactions were observed in one case which necessitated discontinuation of treatment. Laboratory blood values as well as control of liver and kidney function before treatment, after and one week past treatment showed no negative influence due to the drug. In approximately 27% a new colonisation mainly with Pseudomonas could not be prevented.
TI  - Bacteriological quality of runoff water from pastureland.
AB  - Runoff from a cow-calf pasture in eastern Nebraska was monitored for total coliforms (TC), fecal coliforms (FC), and fecal streptococci (FS) during 1976, 1977, and 1978. Bacteriological counts in runoff from both grazed and ungrazed areas generally exceeded recommended water quality standards. The FC group was the best indicator group of the impact of grazing. Rainfall runoff from the grazed area contained 5 to 10 times more FC than runoff from the fenced, ungrazed area. There was little difference in TC counts between the two areas, but FS counts were higher in runoff from the ungrazed area and reflected the contributions from wildlife. Recommended bacteriological water quality standards, developed for point source inputs, may be inappropriate for characterizing nonpoint source pollution from pasture runoff. The FC/FS ratio in pasture runoff was useful in identifying the relative contributions of cattle and wildlife. Ratios below 0.05 were indicative of wildlife sources and ratios above 0.1 were characteristic of grazing cattle. Occasions when the FC/FS ratio of diluted cattle waste exceeded one resulted from differential aftergrowth and die-off between FC and FS. The FC/FS ratio and percentage of Streptococcus bovis in pasture runoff are useful indicators for evaluating the effectiveness of livestock management practices for minimizing bacterial contamination of surface water. The importance of choice of medium for the enumeration of FS in runoff derived from cattle wastes is discussed.
TI  - Minimal antibiotic concentrations of aminoglycosides and beta-lactam antibiotics  for some gram-negative bacilli and gram-positive cocci.
AB  - The minimal antibiotic concentration (MAC) is the lowest concentration of an antibacterial agent that produces a decrease of 1 log in the number of organisms/ml as compared with a control culture in drug-free medium. Various gram-negative bacilli and gram-positive cocci were grown in the presence of amikacin, gentamicin, tobramycin, ampicillin, amoxicillin, oxacillin, carbenicillin, ticarcillin, and cefamandole at concentrations varying from eight times the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) to 1/128 of the MIC. Colony forming units (cfu) were counted, the MIC was determined, and the MIC:MAC ratio, which indicates the magnitude of the effective range, was calculated. The MIC:MAC ratio appears to be characteristic for a given species and antibiotic. There is no relation between the MICs and the MIC:MAC ratios. The highest ratios were given by Proteus mirabilis with aminoglycosides (MIC:MAC mean, 29.2 with tobramycin), and the lowest ratios were given with beta-lactam antibiotics by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus faecalis (MIC:MAC means, 2.1 with carbenicillin and cefamandole, respectively).
TI  - Magnitude of pollution indicator organisms in rural potable water.
AB  - A total of 460 water samples were randomly drawn from the potable water supply sources of rural communities in three counties of South Carolina. About 10% of the population, not incorporated in municipalities, was sampled. The samples were tested for total coliforms, Escherichia coli, and fecal streptococci. Significant levels of these pollution indicator organisms were detected in almost all the water supplies. Total coliforms were the most common, and only 7.5% of the water supplies were uncontaminated. E. coli, considered a reliable indicator of recent and dangerous pollution, was observed in 43% of the water supplies. Statistical analyses indicated that the bacterial populations, especially E. coli, were associated with the supply source depth and its distance from the septic tank. Total coliform counts were also weakly correlated to the pH of the water.
TI  - [Preliminary note on the study of seawater pollution of the Saharan coast of Tunisia].
AB  - The study to an analyse of 726 samples of sea water, taken monthly (1977-1978) at 23 stations. At the basis of the data concerning the NPP of total coliformas, 75,5% of the samples point out a clean water for the bathing place, 11,04% = "acceptable" and 9,96% = "dirty". Considering the data about the MPP of fecal coliformas and of fecal streptocques, the sanitary state is reported in 94,23% "clean for the bathing place", 1,77% "acceptable" and 4% dirty.
TI  - Attachment of bacteria to exfoliated cells from the urogenital tract.
AB  - To establish urogenital infections, organisms must adhere to the mucosal lining.  A differential adherence capacity among various bacterial species was observed when exfoliated urethral and urothelial cells were tested in an in vitro system. No difference in the adherence capacity of a particular species was observed when tested with exfoliated cells obtained from voided urine from different healthy individuals of the same sex. Escherichia coli harvested directly from urine specimens of patients with significant bacteriuria showed a significantly higher capacity to adhere than when obtained from the primary isolation plate. Staphylococcus saprophyticus adhered significantly better to urothelial cells than did Staphylococcus epidermidis. Adherence did not differ when the tests were performed in ultrafiltrated, infected and noninfected urine. Variations of the osmolality did not influence the adherence rate of E. coli. Gonococci showed an increased capacity to adhere when tested in urine of increasing acidity. Gonococci producing T1 colonies adhered by significantly higher numbers per cell than such bacteria producing T4 colonies.

AB  - The present study reports on the application of the Uripret-System for identification and susceptibility testing of microbial agents causing urinary tract infections carried out in a pediatric outpatient clinic. The findings were compared with those determined with the conventional methods in an institute of medical microbiology. For the detected mono- and mixed-cultures, in 85% of the cases a concurrent result of both methods was found. Only in one case a different microbial agent genus was determined with Uripret from that found in the institute. The quota of concurrence of the antibiograms for the mono-cultures was highest at 100% for gentamicin and lowest at 85.07% for tetracycline. With the mixed-cultures the concurrence ranged between 81.25% for tetracycline and 96.88% for sulphamethoxazole-trimethoprim. With proteus in mono- and mixed-culture the antibiograms showed concurrence to a lesser degree compared to the other microbial agent geni. The application of the Uripret-System in pediatric practice can be recommended on the basis of the present results.
TI  - [Development of enterococci and coli bacteria in Bulgarian yogurt].
AB  - The effect of lactic acid fermentation in Bulgarian yoghourt was studied by the development and decline of hygiene level indicating microorganisms--enterococci and coli-bacteriae. It was established that for the first 6 h after production of Bulgarian yoghourt, the quantity of enterococci (Str. faecalis, resp. Str. faecium) increases 5--6 times on the average, after the 12th hour it begins slowly to decrease and the number is reduced two times during storage for 7 days at 7--10 degrees C temperature of 6 days at 18--22 degrees C. The reduction in enterococci number is not fully correlated with the stage of lactic acid fermentation. Coli-bacteriae (E. coli) do not grow in number at the time the milk is turned into yoghourt. Their initial quantity diminishes along with the advance of the lactic acid process and after 24 h of milk storage at 18--22 degrees C or after 48 h at 7--10 degrees C they cannot be detected at all. The conclusion is drawn that enterococci are more suitable as hygiene level indicating microorganisms for hygienic evaluation of Bulgarian yoghourt, as compared to coli-bacteriae, due to their greater viability and longer survival in the product at the time of its production and during storage. It is recommended to perform the investigations on coli-forms not later than the 24th hour after yoghourt productions begins.

AB  - The effect of active and passive antibacterial immunization on transplantation immunity was investigated in rabbits. Immunization with dead bacterial vaccines prepared from E. coli, Proteus mirabilis and Pseudmonas aeruginosa had no effect on skin allograft survival, whereas immunization with vaccines prepared from streptococcal and staphylococcal strains shortened allograft survival. Similar results were obtained with specific antisera against individual microbial species. Skin allografts survived in rabbits treated with antisera against E. coli, Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the same manner as in untreated controls, whereas allograft survival was shortened with antisera against streptococci or staphylococci. The possible mechanism of the stimulatory effect of Gram-positive cocci on transplantation immunity is discussed and the possibilities of using active and passive antibacterial immunication in clinical transplantation are considered.
TI  - Localization of membrane-derived oligosaccharides in the outer envelope of Escherichia coli and their occurrence in other Gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - The glucose-containing, membrane-derived oligosaccharides of Escherichia coli are localized in the external envelope of that organism, most probably in the periplasmic space. The membrane-derived oligosaccharides appear to be generally occurring cell constituents of gram-negative (but not gram-positive) bacteria.
TI  - Microbial impact of Canada geese (Branta canadensis) and whistling swans (Cygnus  columbianus columbianus) on aquatic ecosystems.
AB  - Quantitative and qualitative analyses of the intestinal bacterial flora of Canada geese and whistling swans were carried out with the finding that wild birds harbor significantly more fecal coliforms than fecal streptococci. The reverse was typical of captive and fasting birds. Neither Salmonella spp. nor Shigella spp. were isolated from 44 migratory waterfowl that were wintering in the Chesapeake Bay region. Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli were detected in seven birds. Geese eliminated 10(7) and swans 10(9) fecal coliforms per day. Results of in situ studies showed that large flocks of waterfowl can cause elevated fecal coliform densities in the water column. From the data obtained in this study, it is possible to predict the microbial impact of migratory waterfowl upon aquatic roosting sites.
TI  - Reduction of fecal indicator bacteria in sewage effluent when pumping for crop irrigation.
AB  - When sewage effluent was pumped from a lagoon for spray irrigation the pumping process reduced the fecal coliforms (FC) by 66% and the fecal streptococci (FS) by 91%. Bactericidal effects associated with the pumping of effluent were investigated in the laboratory by seeding sterilized effluent with fecal bacteria and repeatedly passing the liquid through a centrifugal impeller type pump at 50 psi pressure. The pumping effect was cumulative, 49 and 90% of FC being killed after two and four passages through the pump, respectively. FC were more susceptible than FS to injury by pressure shock. Very weak chlorination of the effluent increased the destruction of FC but not FS during subsequent pumping. Within the range of experimental conditions used, the percentage of FC killed by pumping was not markedly affected by changes in temperature and pH of the effluent or by differences in the number and age of cells added.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of nitroxoline and sulphamethizole alone and in combination in urinary tract infections.
AB  - In vitro studies on the antibacterial activity of nitroxoline and sulphamethizole, alone and in combination, were undertaken and minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) determined on a range of urinary pathogens. Eighty per cent of the strains tested were sensitive to less than or equal to 16 mg/l of nitroxoline, and all strains, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus faecalis, were sensitive to less than or equal to 64 mg/l of nitroxoline. No synergism could be demonstrated with sulphamethizole, but the combination was antagonistic when tested against strains of Ps. aeruginosa and Strep. faecalis. An in vivo study on 10 volunteers showed excellent urinary levels of nitroxoline and sulphamethizole after an oral dose of 160 mg of each agent, and 6-hour urinary nitroxoline levels were greater than or equal to 64 mg/l in 9 of the 10 subjects, and sulphamethizole levels were greater than or equal to 64 mg/l in all 10 subjects. Laboratory findings suggest that nitroxoline and sulphamethizole are both suitable agents for use in urinary tract infections caused by organisms sensitive to these agents, but there appears to be litte advantage in using them in combination.
TI  - Association between Streptococcus faecalis urinary infections and graft rejection in kidney transplantation.
AB  - In the first month after transplantation 50% of 193 consecutive renal transplant  recipients had bacteriuria. The most common organisms isolated were Streptococcus faecalis (34), Escherichia coli (28), Pseudomonas spp. (11), and staphylococcus (9). There was a significant correlation between infection with Str. faecalis and graft failure at one, three, and twelve months. This observation suggests that urinary infection with Str. faecalis may be associated with graft failure which is probably the result of immunological factors.
TI  - Incidence and relationship of group D streptococci with other indicator organisms in meats.
AB  - Raw and processed meats were analyzed for presumptive group D streptococci using  KF streptococcus agar. Counts were compared with coliform, presumptive Escherichia coli, and Enterobacteriaceae counts but no meaningful relationships were observed. Results indicated that group D streptococci and E. coli type I were principally contaminants from the packing plant, rather than at retail level. The predominating group D streptococcus in both beef and pork cuts was Streptococcus faecalis, while in processed meat (bologna), the predominating group D streptococci were Streptococcus faecium var. durans and Streptococcus faecium. Streptococcus bovis was not detected among the isolates from any meat samples. Marked differences were noted in numbers of group D streptococci in processed meat from different manufacturers. The results did not support the use of group D streptococci as alternative indicator organisms for meats. However, the association of group D streptococci with packing plant contamination may prove to be of value.
TI  - Validity of fecal coliforms, total coliforms, and fecal streptococci as indicators of viruses in chlorinated primary sewage effluents.
AB  - Quantities of combined chlorine that usually destroyed more than 99.999% of the indigenous fecal coliforms, total coliforms, and fecal streptococci in primary sewage effluents destroyed only 85 to 99% of the indigenous viruses present. Viruses were recovered from five of eight chlorinated primary effluents from which fecal coliforms were not recovered by standard most-probable-number procedures. The limited volumes of such chlorinated effluents that can be tested for indicator bacteria with currently available multiple-tube and membrane filter techniques restrict the value of fecal coliforms, fecal streptococci, and even total coliforms as indicators of viruses in these effluents. Although fecal coliforms and fecal streptococci are useful indicators of viruses in effluents from which these bacteria are recovered, the absence of these bacteria and even total coliforms from disinfected effluents (in standard tests) does not assure that viruses are also absent.
TI  - [Routine test for sensitivity (author's transl)].
AB  - The agar diffusion test is a simple but in most instances reliable method for the determination of the sensitivity of pathogenic bacteria, if it is performed under controlled standardised conditions and evaluated by defined criteria. The accuracy of the test results can be achieved by a permanent control of the test with control strains during routine testing.
TI  - Stomach as source of bacteria colonising respiratory tract during artificial ventilation.
AB  - 10 adults had intermittent positive-pressure ventilation for 3--34 days. All 10 had paralytic ileus. Microbial overgrowth in the stomach was found in 9 patients (bacterial in 7 and fungal in 2); gram-negative bacteria predominated. The trachea invariably became colonised by bacteria, mainly gram-negative organisms. In 3 instances the gram-negative bacteria were found in the stomach before they appeared in the tracheal aspirate, and in 1 case the pathogen originated in the faeces.

TI  - Susceptibility of the anaerobic bacteria, group D streptococci, Enterobacteriaceae, and Pseudomonas to semisynthetic penicillins: carbenicillin, piperacillin, and ticarcillin.
AB  - Sodium piperacillin T-1220, a new semisynthetic penicillin, was tested in vitro against 297 clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria and 669 aerobic bacteria by the conventional agar dilution method and compared with carbenicillin and ticarcillin. At a 100-mug/ml concentration the three drugs showed comparable effectiveness against the anaerobes tested. However, at 20 mug/ml, piperacillin was the most effective drug against Bacteroides fragilis, peptostreptococci, and group D streptococci. At this drug concentration only 48% of the B. fragilis strains exhibited susceptibility to carbenicillin only, 64% exhibited susceptibility to ticarcillin but 90% exhibited susceptibility to piperacillin. Similar findings were observed with peptostreptococci and group D streptococci. On a weight basis piperacillin was statistically shown to be the most effective antibiotic of the three tested against these anaerobes. At 20 mug/ml, piperacillin exhibited a statistically significant difference (P < 0.01) over carbenicillin and ticarcillin for Serratia marcescens, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas isolates, and Citrobacter diversus. At both 20- and 100-mug/ml concentrations, piperacillin appeared to be the most effective (calculated P < 0.01) upon Klebsiella species, K. pneumoniae, S. marcescens, and C. freundii in activity over ticarcillin and carbenicillin.

AB  - Diphenhydramine (N,N-dimethyl-2-diphenyl-methoxy-ethylamine) [N,N-dimethyl-2-(diphenylmethoxy)-ethylamin] (DPH) is a well-known local anaesthetic and an antagonist of both acetylcholine and histamine. We tested its antibacterial efficacy by means of three different investigation methods, i.e. microcalorimetry, continuous density measurement and the microdilution test to find out the MIC of this compound against various bacteria. DPH inhibits the growth of E. coli and Klebsiella strains at a concentration of 0.18% of Staphylococcus aureus haemolyticus at 0.37%, of Pseudomonas aeruginosa at 0.75% and Streptococcus faecalis strains at 1.5%. The results of microcalorimetry and continous density measurements showed that the addition of 0.2% DPH to a broth with growing bacteria interferes very quickly with cell metabolism and stops further reproduction. The microcalorimetric findings were carried out with Staphylococcus aureus haemolyticus strain No. 13,665 an- the E. coli strain No. 3579.

AB  - The antimicrobial activity of urine collected from adult male paraplegics ingesting methenamine mandelate (MM) was evaluated. The in vitro bacterial growth in urine from these patients was inhibited when the free formaldehyde (HCHO) concentration was 10 to 22 microgram per ml. When the HCHO concentration was in the region of 28 microgram per ml or greater, bactericidal effect became apparent. Urine containing 1323 microgram of MM per ml with a pH of 5.9 when freshly voided had sufficient HCHO to be bacteriostatic. Urine containing at least 1740 microgram of MM per ml with a pH of 5.1 or less when freshly voided was bactericidal. The latter concentration of MM in urine was usually achieved when the patient ingested 4 g of MM per day in divided doses and the intake of fluid was not excessive. Under some circumstances an individual receiving MM without an additional acidifying agent may produce urine with a pH low enough to release sufficient HCHO to exert a useful antibacterial effect. However, supplementary acidification with ammonium chloride produced marked lowering of the urinary pH in all patients receiving MM, resulting in bactericidal levels of HCHO.

TI  - Assessment of wound contamination by wound irrigation. Experimental investigations on quantitative recovery of anaerobic and aerobic bacteria.
AB  - The quantitative recovery of E. coli, S. faecalis and B. fragilis from operative  abdominal wounds was investigated in pigs in an experimental model suitable for statistical calculations. Wounds were contaminated in groups of ten with different numbers of either a single bacterial species or a mixture of two species. The wound was irrigated with saline 20 minutes after contamination. Significant differences in recovery were found between the bacterial species investigated. Expressed as percentage of the number of bacteria used for contamination, the recovery for a given species was rather low, but it was constant and independent of the degree of contamination. The investigation did not suggest any principle difference in the recovery of anaerobic and aerobic bacteria. The clinical applicability of the method is not yet clarified.
TI  - Accumulation of thallous ions (Tl+) as a measure of the electrical potential difference across the cytoplasmic membrane of bacteria.
AB  - The accumulation of thallous ions (204Tl+) by intact bacteria was investigated. I conclude that Tl+ is a permeant cation, and that it therefore accumulates in response to the electrical potential difference (delta psi) across the cytoplasmic membrane (interior negative). A comparison with other methods shows that the distribution ratio of 204Tl+ serves as a reasonably satisfactory method for measuring the membrane potential of Streptococcus faecalis. Glycolyzing cells of this organism develop membrane potentials of up to 180 mV. Preliminary experiments with Escherichia coli, especially those with a mutant defective in the proton-translocating ATPase, indicate that the Tl+ distribution also serves as a measure of the membrane potential in this organism. The particular advantage of Tl+ over other indicators of the membrane potential is that the cells need not be pretreated in any way. By use of the Tl+ distribution, it was calculated that respiring cells of E. coli develop a membrane potential of 160 mV with D-lactate and 180 mV with glucose as a substrate, respectively.
TI  - Nucleoside 5'-monophosphate analogues. Synthesis of 5'-sulfamino-5'-deoxynucleosides.
AB  - The synthesis of two new nucleotide analogues is described. 5'-Sulfamino-5'-deoxyadenosine (1) was prepared by reaction of 5'-amino-5'-deoxyadenosine with (CH3)3N.203, and 5'-sulfamino-5'-deoxythymidine (2) was prepared from 5'-amino-5'-deoxythymidine by a similar reaction. The 5'-sulfamino nucleosides are shown to be quite stable to hydrolysis in acidic or basic aqueous solution Tests show that these compounds do not inhibit the growth of Escherichia coli or L1210 cells at concentrations less than 10(-4) M. At 10(-4) M compound 2 was found to give 70% inhibition of the replication of herpes simplex virus (type 1) with no effect on host cell growth (CV-1 monkey line).

Indicator densities increased during weekend human-use periods when compared to weekdays. Increases in indicator densities were also noted downstream from heavily used camping areas when compared to upstream sites. Seasonal, weekly, and diurnal fluctuations in indicator densities were observed. This study suggests that potential health hazards exist in this watershed during periods of human use.
TI  - Interactions of helium, oxygen, and nitrous oxide affecting bacterial growth.
AB  - Helium at pressures of 20 to 70 atm in the presence of air found to stimulate growth of Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus, mainly by increasing the rate of exponential growth. However, at these same pressures, helium potentiated the growth-inhibitory actions of oxygen and nitrous oxide (N2O). Oxygen was found to act essentially as an anesthetic gas in inhibiting growth of S. faecalis; its potency was approximately the same as that of N2O, and it acted additively in combination with N2O to inhibit the streptococcus. Oxygen proved to be more potent than N2O in inhibiting the growth of E. coli and S. aureus, and each gas potentiated the action of the other. Oxygen sensitivity was correlated with N2O sensitivity. Overall, our findings indicate that bacterial growth inhibition by anesthetic gases does not accurately reflect narcotic action.
TI  - Superoxide dismutase and oxygen metabolism in Streptococcus faecalis and comparisons with other organisms.
AB  - Streptococcus faecalis contains a single superoxide dismutase that has been purified to homogeneity with a 55% yield. This enzyme has a molecular weight of 45,000 and is composed of two subunits of equal size. It contains 1.3 atoms of manganese per molecule. Its amino acid composition was determined and is compared with that for the superoxide dismutases from Escherichia coli, Streptococcus mutans, and Mycobacterium lepraemurium. When used as an antigen in rabbits, the S. faecalis enzyme elicited the formation of a precipitating and inhibiting antibody. This antibody cross-reacted with the superoxide dismutase present in another strain of S. faecalis, but neither inhibited nor precipitated the superoxide dismutases in a wide range of other bacteria, including several other streptococci, such as S. pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, and S. lactis. The inhibiting antibody was used to suppress the superoxide dismutase activity present in cell extracts of S. faecalis and thus allow the demonstration that 17% of the total oxygen consumption by such extracts, in the presence of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, was associated with the production of O(2) (-). A variety of bacterial species were surveyed for their content of superoxide dismutases. The iron-containing enzyme was distinguished from the manganese-containing enzyme through the use of H(2)O(2), which inactivates the former more readily than the latter. Some of the bacteria appeared to contain only the iron enzyme, others only the manganese enzyme, and still others both. Indeed, some had multiple, electrophoretically distinct superoxide dismutases in both categories. There was no discernible absolute relationship between the types of superoxide dismutases in a particular organism and their Gram-stain reaction.

Monotypical character of the isolated salmonellae served as the peculiarity of the results obtained: S. typhimurium prevailed (96.3%): S. give were isolated in 3.7% of the cases. The latter were isolated chiefly in the biotypes of one of the populated localities (B); their relative content showed a sharp elevation during storm.

AB  - During different periods in 1976 and 1977 the bacteria of hospitalized patients were selected at random in significant bacteriuria. The species determination was carried out exactly and the susceptibility to beta-lactam-and aminoglycoside antibiotics was investigated using the quantitative tube dilution test. The bacterial spectrum of 941 isolated strains is shown in Table I. E. coli was found in 50% only. The spectrum of bacteria is different in the various hospitals, caused by regional phenomenons of nosocomial infections (Table II). The sex distribution (Table III) shows that mostly E. coli and Strept. faecalis are isolated from women, and Klebsiella sp. from men. The difference is significant. May be there exists a sex specificity for some bacteria. The sensitivity tests include the antibiotics Ampicillin, Carbenicillin, Ticarcillin, Mezlocillin, Azlocillin, Cefalotin, Cefamandole, Cefazolin, Gentamicin, Tobramycin and Amikazin (Table IV). Different sensitivity patterns could be established because of the exact species determination.

The serum agglutinins against the causative agents of infection of the urinary system (colibacillus, Proteus, enterococcus) and C-reactive protein were studied. Phases were revealed in the course of the immunologic reactions depending on the neurodynamics of the damaged spinal cord. The correlation established between the character of changes in the immunologic reactivity and the time elapsed after the injury, the level and the degree of damage to the spinal cord allows the conclusion that cerebrospinal effects are one of the links in the complex chain of central control of immunogenesis.

TI  - Anaerobes in human biliary tracts.
AB  - During a 2-year period, 1,892 patients underwent biliary tract surgery at the Mayo Clinic. Both aerobic and anaerobic cultures of bile were performed in 371 of these patients. Sixty-nine percent of the cultures were positive, and 41% (117) of these grew anaerobes, although they were present in pure culture only twice. Mixed cultures most commonly contained four different organisms (three aerobes and one anaerobe). Bacteroides fragilis was the single most commonly isolated anaerobe and ranked fourth in terms of overall isolates behind Escherichia coli, group D streptococci, and Klebsiella B. fragilis accounted for 7.0% of the total group D streptococci, and Klebsiella. B. fragilis accounted for 7.0% of the total aerobic and anaerobic isolates and was present in 21% of all positive cultures. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Clostridium perfringens ranked fifth and sixth, providing 6.5 and 5.9% of all isolates, respectively. This study demonstrates the frequent presence of anaerobes in patients with bactibilia and suggests that they be considered in the formulation of antimicrobial therapy for infections involving human biliary tracts.

Moreover, for the eucaryote cell Saccharomyces cerevisiae, wild strain or muting "small colonies", only the generating time is altered by the active parts of radiolysis products. The results are analysed with regard to the hypothesis that the hydrogen peroxide is responsible for this toxicity.

AB  - The preceding test results appear to favour the impression method used for the testing of surface disinfection procedures. Further investigations were concerned with the selection of a suitable germ carrier. The high recovery rate of the bacteria and the invariably uniform quality of the germ carrier are the decisive criteria. Since a dependence on the type of germ was also to be expected, we checked Staph. aureus, Str. faecalis, E. coli, Kl. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa for their behaviour on PVC, varnished wooden surfaces, V 2A, rough and smooth glass, resopal, ceramic tiles with dull and glazing finish as well as on plywood. The germ carriers were contaminated quantitatively, dried, sprayed with distilled water to stimulate disinfection and examined after they were allowed to react for a period of 6 hours. A set of 10 germ carriers was examined simultaneously with 10 Rodac impressions. The data were checked by variance analytical methods and evaluated on the mean (or median) values. It was found that while the initial germ number was kept equal OP tiles and V 2A steel produced the highest germ yield. Plywood proved largely unsuitable. Among the test germs, E. coli and Kl. pneumoniae had the lowest adhesion; it was inferior to that of staphylococci and pseudomonads. However, for these 4 germ types 3 impressions per germ carrier suffice for a reliable assessment based on computations. The yield amounts to more than 90 per cent. 94 per cent of the Streptococci were also recovered with 3 impressions, but the absolute germ quantity was low. The use of this type of germ can be recommended only with reservation.
TI  - Chemotactic activity of L-forms and mycoplasma.
AB  - L-forms of Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis showed  significantly less chemotactic activity for normal human leucocytes than did parent bacterial forms which were strongly chemotactic. Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Mycoplasma hominis did not demonstrate chemotactic activity.
TI  - Non-clostridial gas gangrene in the diabetic lower limb.
AB  - Three cases of non-clostridial gas gangrene in diabetic lower limbs are reported. This rare condition occurs only in diabetes with peripheral neuropathy and is invariably fatal unless treated surgically. The clinical picture is deceptive with a slow, but insidiously progressive course, and the late appearance of skin necrosis. Antibacterial therapy is ineffective in preventing death. A serious delay may be fostered by inconclusive bacteriological investigations. Urgent radical amputation is required to save the patient's life.

TI  - Detection and microbiologic assays of antimetabolites.
AB  - The biochemical considerations applicable in the detection of new antimetabolites are very similar to those used in developing microbiologic assays for these drugs. An in vitro system for detection of antimetabolites was developed based on different sensitivities to such drugs of bacteria cultivated in complex versus completely synthetic media. A number of new antimetabolites of amino acids, vitamins, and purines or pyrimidines were isolated and microbiologic assays for these drugs were developed. As an example of the technology utilized and possibilities available, an assay for cytosine arabinoside was described. It can detect 0.5-microgram/ml concentrations of this drug even in the presence of other antitumor or antibacterial antibiotics.
TI  - Bacteriological studies in a patient with antibiotic-associated pseudomembranous  colitis.
AB  - Detailed aerobic and anaerobic bacteriological studies on the operative specimen  from a patient with antibiotic-associated pseudomembranous colitis revealed approximately 10(11) facultatively anaerobic bacteria, but less than 10(5) obligate anaerobes per g of involved colonic tissue. Fourteen isolates of Escherichia coli, three isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and two isolates of Streptococcus fecalis were identified. The majority of the organisms were resistant to most of the antibiotics that the patient had received. Examinations of E. coli for heat-labile and heat-stable enterotoxins and tissue invasiveness were negative, and enterotoxin tests on the P. aeruginosa isolates were negative. Inoculation of mice with the bacterial isolates revealed no unusual pathogenicity. These findings suggest that antibiotic-associated colitis is associated with a marked loss in anaerobic colonic flora, but the colitis could not be explained by the presence of enterotoxins, tissue invasiveness, and pathogenicity of remaining microorganisms.
TI  - An investigation of the bacteriological quality of retail vanilla slices.
AB  - One hundred and thiry-three vanilla slices, purchased from shops in the West Yorkshire Metropolitan County, were examined to determine the numbers and types of bacteria present at the time of purchase. The surface colony count at 37 degrees C was greater than 10(3)/g in 67/133 (50%) of the samples examined, Bacillus cereus being found at that concentration in 21.8%, coliform bacilli including E. coli in 5.3%, Staphylococcus aureus in 3-0% and Streptococcus faecalis in 0-8%. Thirty-four strains of B. cereus were serotyped and 11 (32%) of these were typable with the sera available. Preparation of custard mixed in the laboratory suggests that the milk or milk powder used in the mix may be the major source of B. cereus in the final product. Many of the present methods of manufacture, distribution and storage allow organisms present in the custard at manufacture the opportunity to multiply and possibly reach numbers which present a risk of food poisoning.

TI  - Antimicrobial systems of the surgical wound. II. Detection of antimicrobial protein in cell-free wound fluid.
AB  - Human wound fluid contains heat-stable proteins with moderate antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli, and different heat-labile proteins with antibacterial activity against E coli. Blood serum also contains heat-labile antibacterial substances, but little heat-stable activity against Staphylococcus aureus. Both blood serum and wound fluid have bacteriostatic activity against S epidermidis, and early growth of Streptococcus fecalis occurs in serum and wound fluids. The concentration or activity of antimicrobial proteins increases during the first week in the fresh wound and then decreases as the wound matures.
TI  - [Reservoir for bacteria of urinary tract infections in urologic patients (author's transl)].
AB  - Many infections of the urinary tract, especially after surgical treatment are nosocomial infections. The etiological bacteria could only be found in the urine of the infected patients and in the faecal flora of nearly 40% of all stationary patients. The so called "problem bacteria": Klebsiella, Proteus rettgeri, pseudomonas showed increasing drug resistance during the observed period between 1972-1975. The bacteria isolated from the faecal flora also showed multiple drug resistance. Thus we concluded that the antibiotic regime in these patients is very important for the selection and the increase of the problem bacteria both in urine and in the faecal flora.
TI  - Identification of the presence and type of biliary microflora by immediate gram stains.
AB  - Immediate gram stains were performed on gallbladder bile aspirated at the start of an operation for biliary disease in 191 consecutive patients undergoing elective biliary surgery. The results of the gram stains were telephoned to the operating theater within 20 minutes of collection. The over-all accuracy rate of the telephone gram stain reports compared with the subsequent bile cultures was 77 percent. The incidence of false-positive results was 12 percent, and false-negative results were recorded in 7 percent. The organism was identified wrongly by the gram stain in 4 percent of patients. These results have improved with experience and the over-all accuracy rate of gram stains on bile over the last 6 months have been 87 percent.

Consequently, radiography of the urinary tract with these two media in the concentrations mentioned does not interfere with the culturing of bacteria from urine samples.

TI  - Role of anaerobic bacteria in spontaneous peritonitis of cirrhosis: report of two cases and review of the literature.
AB  - The role of anaerobic or microaerophillic bacteria in spontaneous peritonitis of  cirrhosis has not been clearly defined. Among 126 cases recorded in the literature, in only eight (6 per cent), including the two reported here, was bacterascites associated with anaerobic or microaerophilic bacteria. Clinical features in these cases were indistinguishable from those associated with aerobic bacteria. However, polymicrobial bacterascites occurred in four of eight cases associated with anaerobes, as contrasted with only 10 of 118 cases (8 per cent) associated with aerobes alone. On the other hand, concurrent bacteremia occurred in only one of eight cases associated with anaerobes as contrasted with 52 of 118 cases (44 per cent) of aerobic spontaneous peritonitis. Experimental evidence is cited in an attempt to explain this relatively low incidence of spontaneous peritonitis associated with anaerobic or microaerophilic bacteria, despite the high density of these organisms in the normal bowel flora.

TI  - [Dynamics of the establishment of intestinal microflora in healthy full-term newborns].
AB  - A study was made of the dynamics of establishment of the intestinal microflora in 79 healthy mature neonates born of healthy mothers. A total of 223 bacteriological examinations were conducted. A stable prevalence of bifidobacteria over the aerobic portion of the intestinal biocenosis occurred in all the children from the 8th day after birth. Along with this the following bacteria were continuously present in the intestine: lactic bacilli and streptococci E. coli, enterococci and staphylococci; however, their portion in the biocenosis was not great. Bacteroids, microbes of the Proteus genus, and yeast-like fungi were found in the cultures only before the establishment of a high bifidobacteria level. Conditionally pathogenic microorganisms and their associations were continuously revealed in 19.8% of healthy mature neonates. Apparently the qualitative prevalence of bifidobacteria prevented the clinical expression of dysbacteriosis in these children.

AB  - The influence of contamination of germfree guinea pigs with individual representatives of the intestinal microflora (Bac. mesentericus, Bac. subtilis, S. albus, and S. faecalis) on the formation of the serum opsonic activity was studied. An increase of the opsonic activity to all the microorganisms on the 11th day after a corresponding monocontamination and a stimulating influence of the serum on the intracellular digestion of Bac. mesentericus and Bac. subtilis microbes was noted. As to the pathogenic microorganisms (E. coli 055), S. Faecalis only were capable of stimulating the serum opsonic activity. The results indicated the presence of an association between the microflora composition and the opsonic activity of the animal blood serum. The value of this index also depended on the properties of the phagocytosis object.
TI  - A simplified method using commercial milk powder for hand-rearing of the Caesarean-derived infant rabbits (author's transl).
AB  - An efficient and simplified method for hand-rearing of Caesarean-derived infant rabbits under gnotobiotic condition was devised. The Caesarean-derived infant Dutch or Japanese-White rabbits and their hybrids (F1; Japanese-White female x Dutch male) were reared in sterilized vinyl-isolators by hand-feeding with two kinds of milk diets, A and B, consisted mainly ofa commercial milk powder for dogs and cats (Esbilac) supplemented with several minor components (Table 2) and administered intragastrically once a day through a Nelaton's catheter. Bacteriological examinations revealed that feces and urine were sterile for the first three days. On the third day, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus, and Bacteroides sp. were given with milk diet and the infant rabbits were reared until 10 to 12 weeks of age. The weaning rate at 5 weeks of age and the raising rate at 3 months of age were approximately 78% and 77%, respectively (Table 3), indicating that feeding once-a-day with a milk diet mainly composed of Esbilac is suitable for the hand-rearing of infant rabbits. There was, however, no significant difference milk diet A and B on the weaning rate.
TI  - [Preliminary tests of the influence of wastewaters from sugar-factories upon the  numbers of intestinal bacteria in water (author's transl)].
AB  - This work presents the results of experiments dealing with the influence of wastewaters from 2 sugar factories in the Czechoslovakia upon some representatives of intestinal bacteria: E. coli, C. feundii, E. aerogenes, S. anatum, S. schottmuelleri, S. typhi-murium, Sh. sonnei and Str. faecalis. The experiments were carried out at 30, 20 and 10 degrees C. The experiments have shown that the presterilized waste-water from sugar factory (in Bohemia and in Slovakia) caused rapid multiplication of the test-organisms: E. coli, C. freundii, E. aerogenes, S. anatum, S. schottmuelleri, S. typhi-murium, less by Sh. sonnei and Str. faecalis, at 30, 20 and 10 degrees C. The intensity of multiplication was direct proportional to the concentration of waste water and was effective to dilution 1:1000 (diluted with presterilized surface waters Vltava, Danube).
TI  - Evidence that the multi-drug-resistance of Streptococcus faecalis BIO-4R is not carried by a plasmid.
AB  - The multi-drug-resistant strain Streptococcus faecalis BIO-4R was studied to see  if it carried a plasmid responsible for antibiotic resistance. From results indicating that the antibiotic resistance of S. faecalis BIO-4R was not transferred to recipient bacteria, that the organism did not produce enzymes which inactivated antibiotics, and that the presence of covalently closed circular DNA was not demonstrated by dye-cesium chloride buoyant density gradient centrifugation, it was concluded that the organism did not carry such a plasmid. Studies on polyphenylalanine synthesis by cell-free extracts of the oganism showed that its ribosomes were resistant to chloramphenicol, tetracycline, streptomycin and kanamycin. These results, although rather indirectly, support the above notion that the multi-drug-resistance of S. faecalis BIO-4R is not mediated by a plasmid.
TI  - Identification and characterization of a small sequence located at two sites on the amplifiable tetracycline resistance plasmid pAMalpha1 in Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - Streptococcus faecalis DT-11 harbors the 6.0-megadalton plasmid pAMalpha1, which  determines resistance to tetracycline (TC). When this strain is grown in the presence of TC for a number of generations, a reversible gene amplification occurs, generating tandem repeats of a 2.65-megadalton segment of the plasmid. On the basis of heteroduplex studies between various forms of pAMalpha1 and fragments generated by the Escherichia coli restriction endonuclease EcoRI, we have obtained direct evidence for the presence of a small sequence designated RS1 (for recombination sequence) located on both sides of the TC resistance determinant. Corresponding points on the two sequences are separated by 2.65 megadaltons of deoxyribonucleic acid. The two RS1 sequences have the same polarity and are of a size corresponding to about 380 nucleotide base pairs. The data presented serve as strong support for amplification models that are based on recombinational events involving the RS1 sequences.

It was found that polymyxin M caused dysbacteriosis in the digestive tract. Reduction of the impaired biocenosis after discontinuation of polymyxin use was rapid and practically complete.
TI  - [Further investigations into the effectiveness of gentamicin and other antibiotics against urinary tract infection organisms (author's transl)].
AB  - In continuance of our investigations from 1968 to 1972, we isolated 32939 microorganisms from urinary tract infections and subjected them to routine sensitivity tests against six antibiotics from 1973 to August 1975. All organisms except enterococci and proteus proved to be sensitive to gentamicin at a level exceeding 90% during the study period of two and a half years. A loss of activity of gentamicin worth mentioning was not detected during the studies. So this antibiotic must further be considered as one of the drugs of first choice in the treatment of urinary tract infections.
TI  - A study of complications in preterm deliveries after prolonged premature rupture  of the membranes.
AB  - The risk of infection for mother and baby after spontaneous rupture of the membranes was evaluated in a prospective study of 24 patients with ruptured membranes before the 36th week of pregnancy. The mean length of pregnancy after rupture was 10 days and 2 hours. Only patients harboring Group B streptococci or E. coli in the urogenital tract were treated with antibiotics (during delivery). With the exception of 1 woman, all patients harbored one or more pathogens in the urogenital tract. Four mothers were infected but all recovered. One of 26 infants died from infection. The study did not confirm any association between prolonged rupture of the membranes and the frequency of idiopathic respiratory distress syndrome, nor did it contradict attempts to actively prolong pregnancy after rupture of the membranes.

TI  - A unifying concept for the active site region in aspartate transcarbamylase.
AB  - Recent investigations on the aspartate transcarbamylases (carbamoylphosphate:L-aspartate carbamoyltransferase, EC 2.1.3.2) of Escherichia coli and Streptococcus faecalis indicate that there is a site on each enzyme, apart from the active site, at which anions can bind. It is suggested in this paper that the location of such an anion binding site on the E. coli enzyme may be directly adjacent to the part of the active site at which carbamyl phosphate binds. This hypothesis is based on data demonstrating a lack of correlation between spectral changes and kinetic effects, and on a new interpretation of results obtained with N-(phosphonacetyl)-L-aspartate, which has previously been considered to act as a transition state analogue. Such a hypothesis could explain other puzzling observations made on the catalytic subunit of this enzyme, including the dependence of substrate inhibition by aspartate on the nature of the second substrate, and the ease of formation of a dead-end enzyme-aspartate-carbamyl-aspartate complex.
TI  - Rubella hemagglutination-inhibition test: false-positive reactions in sera contaminated with bacteria.
AB  - We have shown that bacterial contamination of sera can have a marked influence on the results of the rubella hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) test. In addition to increasing the levels of nonspecific agglutinins, a number of common bacterial species tested had a significant effect on the HI titers. When sera free from rubella-specific antibodies were contaminated with Bacillus subtilis or Pseudomonas fluorescens, HI titers ranged from 16 to 128 (expressed as the reciprocal of the highest serum dilution completely inhibiting hemagglutination) after treatment with heparin/MnCl2. Our observations demonstrate, therefore, that bacterial contamination can be one of the causes of false-positive reactions in this test.

TI  - Fecal indicator bacteria persistence under natural conditions in an ice-covered river.
AB  - Total coliform (TC), fecal coliform (FC), and fecal streptococcus (FS) survival characteristics, under natural conditions at 0 degrees C in an ice-covered river, were examined during February and March 1975. The membrane filter (MF) technique was used throughout the study, and the multiple-tube (MPN) method was used in parallel on three preselected days for comparative recovery of these bacteria. Survival was studied at seven sample stations downstream from all domestic pollution sources in a 317-km reach of the river having 7.1 days mean flow time (range of 6.0 to 9.1 days). The mean indicator bacteria densities decreased continuously at successive stations in this reach and, after adjustment for dilution, the most rapid die-off was found to occur during the first 1.9 days, followed by a slower decrease. After 7.1 days, the relative survival was TC less than FC less than FS, with 8.4%, 15.7%, and 32.8% of the initial populations remaining viable, respectively. These rates are higher than previously reported and suggest that the highest survival rates for these bacteria in receiving streams can be expected at 0 degree C under ice cover. Additionally, the FC-FS ratio was greater than 5 at all stations, indicating that this ratio may be useable for determining the source of fecal pollution in receiving streams for greater than 7 days flow time at low water temperatures. The MPN and MF methods gave comparable results for the TC and FS at all seven sample stations, with both the direct and verified MF counts within the 95% confidence limits of the respective MPNs in most samples, but generally lower than the MPN index. Although FC recovery on membrane filters was comparable results at stations near the pollution source. However, the results became more comparable with increasing flow time. The results of this study indicate that heat shock is a major factor in suppression of the FC counts on the membrane filters at 44.5 degree C. Heat shock may be minimized by extended incubation at 35 degrees C before exposure to the higher temperature.
TI  - Home urine cultures by the dip-strip method: results in 289 cultures.
AB  - Bacteriuria screening on 289 children was performed by their parents by means of  a self-administered dip-strip culture which was inoculated, incubated, and interpreted in the home. Simultaneous pour-plate quantitative cultures and laboratory-tested dip-strip cultures were done on the same urine specimen which had been tested at home. The dip-strip culture was reliable (89%) in detecting significant bacteriuria with home administration and interpretation. Only 1.6% false-positive results occurred in the home testing. The dip-strip home cultures are an effective way for screening or follow-up of patients with bacteriuria.
TI  - The effect of prophylactic ampicillin on pelvic infection following vaginal hysterectomy.
AB  - One hundred patients undergoing vaginal hysterectomy at the University of Kentucky Medical Center were given prophylactic ampicillin and compared to one hundred control patients. The use of prophylactic ampicillin caused significant reduction in both postoperative pelvic infection and hospital stay. However, two patients in the prophylactic antibiotic group later required readmission for infections resistant to ampicillin. Prophylactic antibiotics are beneficial in vaginal hysterectomy, but careful follow-up of all patients is mandatory.
TI  - [Effect of contamination of germ-free guinea pigs by individual representatives of the intestinal microflora on antibody and complement concentrations].
AB  - On the 3rd day after birth germ-free guinea pigs were contaminated with one of the following representatives of normal intestinal microbial flora: Bac. mesentericus, Bac. subtilis, S. albus, and S. faecalis. In the animals aged two weeks a study was made of the level of antibodies against the microorganisms used for monocontamination, and also to the E. coli O55 pathogenic for guinea pigs; the complement content in the serum was examined as well. Bac. mesentericus and Bac. subtilis contamination of guinea pigs altered the antibody content to these microbes but insignificantly, whereas S. albus and S. faecalis stimulated the antibody genesis considerably. Similar results were obtained in respect to E. coli O55. The complement level was markedly stimulated by the spore aerobes and S. albus.
TI  - Virus and bacteria removal from wastewater by land treatment.
AB  - Secondary sewage effluent and renovated water from four wells at the Flushing Meadows Wastewater Renovation Project near Phoenix, Arizona, in operation since 1967, were assayed approximately every 2 months in 1974 for viruses and enteric bacteria during flooding periods. No viruses of Salmonella sp. were detected in any renovated well water samples, and the numbers of fecal coliforms, fecal streptococci, and total bacteria were decreased by about 99.9% in the renovated well waters after the wastewater was filtered through about 9 m of soil.
TI  - Use of droplet plating method and cystine-lactose-lactng electrolyte-deficient medium in routine quantitative urine culturing procedure.
AB  - Droplet plating of 0.01 ml of 10(-2) dilutions of mixed sonically treated urines  onto cystine-lactose electrolyte-deficient agar permits formation of discrete, easily counted colonies within a small circumscribed area without interference by Proteus overswarm. Each colony is considered as arising from a single viable cell. The single dilution permits precise reproducible quantitation of urine bacteria population within the range 10(4) to 10(6) cells/ml of sample. Droplet-plated counts were found to be consistently (approximately) double those determined by standard pour plate quantitation. The method requires only inexpensive readily available materials and has been performed routinely in a large-volume clinical laboratory for several years.
TI  - Aetiological factors in pelvic inflammatory disease in urban Blacks in Rhodesia.
AB  - Pelvic inflammatory disease is the main reason for the admission of patients to the Gynaecological Unit at Harari Hospital. Some epidemiological and microbiological aspects of the disease have been studied. Gonococcus was isolated infrequently from inpatients, but there appears to be a pool of potential pathogens, both aerobic and anaerobic, which are able to invade the upper genital tract under certain circumstances. Mycoplasmas were isolated from a high percentage of patients.

AB  - A strain of Lactobacillus casei from a pharmaceutical preparation became established in the digestive tract of an axenic child. It was eliminated by the first bacteria occurring after inoculation of the child's digestive tract with a human flora, before the child was taken out of the isolator. Using "gnotoxenic" mice, we found that the elimination of L. casei was due to a bactericidal effect of the Escherichia coli of human origin, within the digestive tract.
TI  - Microorganisms responsible for controlling the populations of Escherichia coli and enterococcus and the consistency of cecal contents in the chicken.
AB  - A study was made to clarify what kinds of intestinal organisms might be responsible for controlling the populations of Escherichia coli and Streptococcus faecalis var. liquefaciens in the cecum and the consistency of the cecal of chickens. Germ-free chickens were inoculated orally with various mixtures of bacterial cultures alone or in combination, different dilutions of the cecal contents of chickens, different dilutions of the cecal contents treated by healing or with chloroform, the supernatant of diluted cecal contents, and dilutions of human feces. Factors controlling the E. Coli populations, enterococcal populations, and consistency of the cecal contents were shown to be independent of one another. The ecosystem controlling the E. coli or enterscoccal population was more complex than that controlling the consistency of the cecal contents. The former was composed of anaerobic and facultatively anaerobic bacteria isolated and heat- or chloroform-resistance organisms, and the latter of heat- or chloroform-resistance alone, which were inferred not to prevailing in the cecal contents of chickens. Discussion is made on ecological systems controlling flora.

AB  - A microbiological survival chamber for in situ environmental studies involving microorganisms of public health significance was developed. The autoclavable chamber was provided with a supportive base for proper flow orientation and a battery-powered stirring mechanism for continuous internal agitation. The performance of the chamber and its ancillary units was evaluated in estuarine waters by diffusion studies and survival tests with eight species of bacteria isolated from environmental sources. Polycarbonate filter membranes were found superior to cellulosic filter membranes. Continuous mixing enhanced diffusion and ensured uniform cell suspension. Salmonella enteritidis and Klebsiella pneumoniae exhibited somewhat greater viability than Escherichia coli under similar conditions. Of three indicator organisms tested, Streptococcus faecalis was the most persistent. In general, the data obtained indicate the usefulness of the chamber in measurements of microbial survival in the natural marine environment.
TI  - Bacteriological quality assessment of fresh marketed lettuce and fennel.
AB  - One-hundred and twenty samples of lettuce and 89 samples of fennel purchased from five retail outlets in the city of Bari (Italy) from October 1973 through September 1975 were examined for viable aerobic bacteria (AB), total coliforms (TC), fecal coliforms (FC), fecal streptococci (FS), and salmonellae. Comparative tests indicated that the results of bacteriological analysis of wash water from either vegetable by a membrane filter technique compared favorably with those of conventional cultural examination of the vegetable tissue for the purpose of providing an indication of the bacteriological quality of the samples. Using the membrane filter technique, 2-year average counts of 6.59 X 10(7) for AB, 5.95 X 10(4) for TC, 6.13 X 10(3) for FC and 2.24 X 10(3) for FS/100 g (fresh weight) were obtained with lettuce; with fennel, the corresponding figures were 2.32 X 10(6) for AB, 7.82 X 10(4) for TC, 7.8 X 10(4) for FC, and 3.15 X 10(3) for FS. Indicator bacteria were present in all samples examined. In addition, 68.3% of the lettuce and 71.9% of the fennel samples yielded one or more of the following Salmonella serotypes: S. schottmuelleri, S. typhimurium, S. thompson, S. dublin, S. typhi, and S. anatum.

The role of the Parma University Hygiene Institute was to study the water qualities of the river Po between Cremona and Casalmaggiore and of two right side tributaries, Arda-Ongina and Taro. The hydrogeographical characteristics of the examined reach are reported in the present note, with special reference to the hydrological conditions, basin area, inhabitants and industrial typology. The sampling stations were placed upstream and downstream Cremona town, near Casalmaggiore and at the mouth of Arda-Ongina and Taro. Moreover the methods, for chemical and bacteriological analysis are reported.
TI  - Specificity of bacterial ribosomes and messenger ribonucleic acids in protein synthesis reactions in vitro.
AB  - Ribosomes from two Gram-negative bacteria translated f2 RNA, T4 early mRNA, mRNA  from three Gran-negative bacteria, and mRNA from six Gram-positive bacteria; ribosomes from three Gram-positive bacteria translated mRNA from the Gram-positive strains, but did not translate the other mRNAs. Ribosomes from the Gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli translated synthetic poly(U,G) but ribosomes from the Gram-positive bacterium Clostridium pasteurianum translated poly(U,G) very poorly, mRNA from Gram-negative bacteria was translated only in the presence of a high salt ribosomal wash containing initiation factors. mRNA from Gram-positive bacteria and synthetic poly(U,G) were translated much more efficiently when wash components were present, but were also translated to a small, but significant, extent in the absence of wash components. The translation specificity of each type of ribosome was independent of the source of ribosomal wash components. When the radioactively labeled products of in vitro protein synthesis were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide slab gel electrophoresis and autoradiography, it was found that each different bacterial and phage RNA preparation directed the synthesis of a unique set of polypeptide products of discrete sizes. Three different types of ribosomes were used to translate each of several Gram-positive bacterial messenger preparations; the overall patterns of products obtained with a given mRNA are similar, but some differences in the products formed or the relative amounts of the various products synthesized can be detected.

TI  - [Gentamicin-susceptibility of various pathogens isolated from clinical materials].
AB  - We studied on the antibacterial activity of gentamicin against various pathogens  isolated from clinical materials mainly isolated during 1974 and 1975, comparing with other antibiotics. Beta hemolytic streptococci, pneumococci and enterococci are less susceptible to gentamicin than staphylococci. Staph, aureus and Staph. epidermidis resistant to various antibiotics are very susceptible to gentamicin, and no resistant strain to this drug was found. Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae and H. parahaemolyticus are very susceptible to gentamicin, and there is no resistant strain to this drug. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Citrobacter, Serratia and five species of Proteus are more susceptible to gentamicin and tobramycin than dibekacin and amikacin. A few resistant or less susceptible strains to gentamicin are found in E. coli, Citrobacerr, Serratia, Pr. morganii and Pr. rettgeri. Pr. inconstans is less susceptible to gentamicin than other species of Proteus. Antibacterial activity of gentamicin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa is very strong, but dibekacin and tobramycin are stronger. Gentamicin-resistant strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa are now rather few.
TI  - Aquatic indicator bacteria in the high alpine zone.
AB  - Selected waters from the high alpine zone within Grand Teton National Park, Wyoming, were analyzed for populations of indicator bacteria during the past three summers to determine the influence of various factors on the quality of these waters. In general the water quality was not significantly influenced by the presence or absence of human visitors but rather by the nature of the biological community through which the streams flowed. A minority of the coliforms that were recovered from all of the sites proved to be fecal coliforms. The fecal streptococci isolated were identified as the species that were found primarily in the fecal material of the native rodent and moose populations. It is concluded that management questions that relate to the carrying capacity of alpine areas should be approached with the aid of other biological parameters along with levels of indicator bacteria in the streams.
TI  - Products from furans. 1. Sunthesis and anticoccidial and antimicrobial activity of 5-amino-5,6-dihydro-6-methoxy-2-methyl-2-(4'-biphenylyl)-2H-pyran-3(4H)-ones and related compounds.
AB  - A Michael type addition of an amine to 6-methoxy-2-methyl-2-(4'-biphenylyl)-2H-pyran-3(6H)-one (1) dissolved in ether, benzene, or THF gave 5-amino derivatives of 5,6-dihydro-6-methoxy-2-methyl-2-(4'-biphenylyl)-2H-pyran-3(4H)-one (2). These by subsequent reduction with LiAlH4 were converted to 5-amino derivatives of 6-methoxy-2-methyl-2-(4'-biphenylyl)tetrahydro-2H-pyran-3-ol (3). Both isomers A and B of 1 (in regard to the methoxy group at C6) were used for the synthesis of 2 and 3. The in vitro antimicrobial activity of the amine adducts 2 was of the same order of magnitude as the starting material. Amine adducts in general, however, were by far more active as coccidiostats than the starting material and retained their activities when they were reduced. 5,6-Dihydro-6-methoxy-2-methyl-2-(4'-biphenylyl)-5-(dimethylamino)-2H-pyran-3(4H) -one hydrochloride (A) and 5,6-dihydro-6-methoxy-2-methyl-2-(4'-biphenylyl)-5-(dimethylamino)-2H-pyran-3(4H) -one hydrochloride (B), prepared from isomer A and B of 1, respectively, were the most active as coccidiostats. These compounds when administered orally to chickens 1 day prior to infection at a concentration 0.05% in their diet gave them total protection against Eimeria tenella.
TI  - Racemic diastereoisomers of 1-amino-2-hydroxycyclopentanecarboxylic acid.
AB  - The synthesis and characterization of the two diastereoisomeric forms of 1-amino-2-hydroxycyclopentanecarboxylic acid have been accomplished. A previously reported synthesis produced a racemic mixture of the threonine analog trans-2-hydroxy-1-aminocyclopentanecarboxylic acid (trans with respect to the hydroxy and carboxyl group). The alternate allothreonine analog was produced by conversion of cyclopentene oxide to trans-2-methoxycyclopentanol, followed by oxidation to 2-methoxycyclopentanone and conversion to a hydantoin. Fractional crystallization of the hydantoin sample, followed by hydrolysis, produced cis-2-hydroxy-1-aminocyclopentanecarboxylic acid (cis with respect to the hydroxy and carboxyl group) in high purity. Neither of the isomeric forms significantly inhibited the growth of the bacterial strains examined nor were they effective in inhibiting Jensen sarcoma cells in tissue culture.
TI  - Bacterial endocarditis. Echocardiographic and clinical evaluation during therapy.
AB  - In two patients with bacterial endocarditis and apparent vegetations, the echocardiographic findings included thickening but normal excursion of the mitral leaflet and abnormal shaggy echoes superimposed on the mitral leaflet echogram. Both patients had had endocarditis several weeks before the study was performed. In both patients the abnormal echoes disappeared after antibiotic therapy. Whether or not the echocardiographic findings are specific to bacterial endocarditis must be determined by further studies. One patient had evidence of "immune complex disease" with vasculitis, hypocomplementemia, and renal failure which persisted for weeks after disappearance of vegetations on the echocardiogram. This sequence was unexpected, as a continued source of antigen for this reaction was not apparent.
TI  - On the mode of action of 5-diazouracil on bacterial cell division.
AB  - Cell division by strains of Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium is inhibited by 5-diazouracil (5-DU). Division recovers in the presence of the inhibitor after a period which is temperature-dependent. Recovery is probably due to breakdown of 5-DU and the rate of this breakdown is apparently increased at alkaline pH. Growth with 5-DU caused only a slight reduction in the rate of murein synthesis and no alteration in the properties or composition of membranes of S. typhimurium. The agent caused chaining in Streptococcus fecalis and inhibition of the penicillin-induced lysis of S. typhimurium. These effects may have been due to direct inhibition of lysin activity but an indirect effect seems more likely. The most marked effect of 5-DU on S. typhimurium was to cause a transient inhibition of DNA synthesis. Since 5-DU did not stop uncoupled cell division (i.e. division occurring independently of DNA replication) and since lon- strains were more sensitive to 5-DU than lon+ strains, it was concluded that 5-DU acts on cell division via an inhibitory effect on DNA replication.
TI  - Distribution of group D streptococci in rivers and streams.
AB  - A study was undertaken to determine sources of bacteriological contamination of rivers as well as the ecology of faecal streptococci in natural and contaminated waters. Media used to characterize and speciate group D streptococci were also evaluated using isolates from the water and sediment. Due to the low concentrations of faecal coliforms (FC) and faecal streptococci (FS) in river water samples, the FC/FS ratio was shown to be of little value in determining sources of contamination. High concentrations of FC and FS from sediment samples gave more credible FC/FS ratios. The actual distribution of group D streptococcal species in rivers and streams was also shown. High concentrations of all division II species (S. faecium, S. faecium var. casseliflavus, and S. faecium var. durans) were found in the water and sediment samples, with S. faecium var. durans comprising 50% of the total number of isolates. Low concentrations of division I group D streptococci (S. faecalis and varieties) were found, while only one isolation of division III group D streptococci (S. bovis and S. equinus) was made.
TI  - Bacterial flora of the healthy skin in children.
AB  - The normal bacterial flora of the skin of 100 healthy children was studied in a paediatric practice with regard to the germ spectrum and the resistance constellation, by means of abrasion skin samples taken from the upper part of the back. Staphylococcus albus was by far the most predominant bacteria, followed by Sarcina bacteria and Corynebacteria. The high degree of pervasion of this physiological cutaneous flora with antibiotic-resistant strains increases the suspicion that in the case of florid bacterial skin infections in children, subsequent to traumatic or inflammatory changes of the integument, the antibiotic resistance of the normal resident flora can be transferred to the pathogenic flora. In view of the endemic resistance of pathogenic and saprobic strains of bacteria against practically all antibiotics at present used in paediatric practice, it is to be urgently recommended that instead of antibiotics topical braod-spectrum antimicrobial agents (antiseptics), e.g. clioquinol, triclosan, etc., should preferably be used.
TI  - [Criteria for the evaluation of hygienic and microbiologic characteristics of mineral waters].
AB  - The appraisement of mineral waters microbial quality is closely depending of their definition: waters endowed with therapeutic properties, strongly mineralised waters, etc. In the beginning mineral water is exceptionally infected by dangerous germs tought it contain a regular load of some saprophytic microorganisms. Indeed, exploitation licences are reserved to geologically perfectly protected strata. On the other hand, there are contaminations which are due, most commonly, to the bottling procedures: packings, work-rooms atmospheres, staff, etc. This being so, evaluation tests must be largely extended with regard to those of feed water. We can distinguish between some bound to perfectly known real risks and some referred to more hypothetical and more suggested dangers. The first ones protect from fecal contaminations (Salmonella, coliforms, fecal Streptococci, sulphite-reducing Clostridium, fecal bacteriophages) and from cutaneous and mucous contaminations (pathogenic Staphylococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa). They must be supervised with the most extreme severity. The second ones are concerned with saprophytic oligotrophic germs. At the present time, their incidence on public health cannot be discussed on serious foundations. It is the same for amoebae's presence which seems frequent in all kinds of waters. These problems must form the subject of thorough researchers.
TI  - [Influence of amnioscopy on the development of fetal infection].
AB  - Bacteriologycal examinations of vaginal swabs from the cervix obtained during 45  amnioscopies, demonstrated a rise in culture positivity after the 2-nd and 3-rd amnioscopies. Bacteriologycal examinations in the same women on the 2-nd and 3-rd days of puerperium demonstrated a change of bacterial flora with appearance of more virulent flora. The problem of possible "ascending" infections or hospital infections is discussed.
TI  - [Study on the antibacterial activity of penicillins and cephalosporines in urine  (author's transl)].
AB  - Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) for penicillin (PEN), ampicillin (AMP), cephalothin (CEF), cefazolin (CEZ), carbenicillin (CAR) and ticarcillin (TIC) were determined against Strep. faecalis, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, Prot. mirabilis and Ps. aeruginosa in Sensitivity Test Broth (STB) and human urine. Marked differences were seen in MIC between these two media, especially against P. mirabilis strains tested. Against E. coli the MIC of AMP, CEF and CEZ were similar or slightly lower in urine than in STB. MIC for CAR against E. coli were higher in urine. Against K. pneumoniae the MIC for CEF and CEZ were 2-4fold higher in urine than in STB. The activity of CAR and TIC against Ps. aeruginosa was lower in urine. Albeit high concentrations of antibiotics (up to 800fold) no inhibition was achieved in urine against P. mirabilis by AMP, CEF or CEZ. Only against Strep. faecalis all tested antibiotics had lower MIC in urine than in STB.

TI  - Microbiological studies on some bladder irrigation fluids.
AB  - A 1.5% glycine solution has recently been introduced as a bladder irrigation fluid. In this study, glycine solution was compared with two other recognised bladder irrigants (chlorhexidine and noxythiolin) for its inhibitory activity against common urinary tract pathogens. Glycine solution supported the growth of nearly 50% of the bacterial strains tested whereas chlorhexidine and noxythiolin were completely inhibitory. In quantitative studies with selected strains it was found that growth could be initiated from as few as 200 organisms/ml. It was concluded that glycine solution was capable of supporting bacterial growth and thus, from a microbiological viewpoint, was unsuitable as a bladder irrigant.
TI  - Synthesis of Schiff bases of benzofuran with potential biological activity.
AB  - Reduction of 5-methoxy-6-formyl(Ia)- and 5-formyl-6-methoxy-2,3-diphenylbenzofuran (IVa) yielded 6- and 5-methyl derivatives Ib and IVb, respectively. Oxidation, hydrolysis and demethylation of Ib and IVb gave 2,2-dihydroxy-4-methyl-)IIc)-and2,4-dihydroxy-5-methylbenzofuran )Vc). The carboxamides Ie and IVe were obtained from the oximes Ic and IVc via the cyano derivatives Id and IVd. By condensation of the aldehydes If, IVf and VII with primary amines the corresponding Schiff bases (IIIa--c, VI and VIIIa--f) were obtained. The antibacterial activity of the Schiff bases and previously prepared benzofuran derivatives were investigated.

AB  - E. Coli and Strep. faecalis inoculated intravenously in normal rabbits produced initial concentrations of 10(6) bacteria per ml blood. Culture of common duct bile collected continously via a catheter in the common duct, and of gallbladder bile aspirated by puncture, failed to demonstrate a passage of bacteria from blood to bile. Sterile common duct bile and gallbladder bile in the presence of high counts of viable bacteria in blood, gallbladder wall and liver tissue demonstrated that the intact biliary tract mucosa and the intactc liver form an effective barrier impermeable to E. coli or Strep. faecalis.

TI  - Microbial synergy in experimental intra-abdominal abscess.
AB  - Intra-abdominal sepsis was studied in Wistar rats by using four microbial species: Escherichia coli, enterococci, Bacteroides fragilis, and Fusobacterium varium. These organisms were implanted into the peritoneal cavity singly and in all possible dual combinations. Results were evaluated by mortality rates and the incidence of intra-abdominal abscesses on autopsy following sacrifice after 7 days. Mortality was restricted to recipients of E. coli, thus implicating coliforms in the acute lethality associated with this experimental model. Intra-abdominal abscesses were produced in 61 of 95 (94%) animals that received the combination of an anaerobe and a facultative organism. Abscesses failed to form with any single strain or with E. coli plus enterococci, and they were detected in one 1 of 19 animals receiving B. fragilis plus F. varium. These results suggest that intra-abdominal abscess formation is related to synergy between anaerobes and facultative bacteria.
TI  - Chemistry and antibacterial activity of nitrobenzofurans.
AB  - Thirteen 2-methylbenzofurans were synthesized and their antibacterial activity was investigated. 2-Methyl-3-nitrobenzofuran and analogs containing 7-NO2, 5-NO2, 7-Br, 7-CONH2, and 7-CF3 substituents are bacteriostatic. The spectrum of activity of these compounds is similar to nitrofurazone; however, a strain of E. coli Br which has increased resistance to nitrofurazone did not show increased resistance to 3,7-dinitro-2-methylbenzofuran (1). The 3-nitro-2-methylbenzofurans are labile in solution (T1/2 0.8-3.5 hr at 37 degrees, pH 7.0). The solvolysis product of 1 was identified as alpha,6-dinitro-o-cresol (15). The 3-nitrobenzofurans are more potent in minimal media than in Penassay broth. This greater potency can be abolished by addition of casamino acids and tryptophan to the minimal media.

TI  - In vitro bacteriological evaluation of the effectiveness of antimicrobial irrigating solutions.
AB  - Nineteen strains of pathogenic aerobic bacteria were exposed for fifteen seconds  in vitro to varying concentrations of five antibiotics and of polyvinyl povidone iodine in saline solution. The presence of human plasma in the solution (30 per cent by volume) did not affect bacterial sensitivity to the antibiotics. Most of the bacteria were sensitive to the solutions during that brief exposure. Bacteria which were more sensitive by disc sensitivity tests were more sensitive to the solutions. Polyvinyl povidone iodine sterilized all cultures in concentrations as low as 25 per cent. It is proposed that the use of appropriate antimicrobial solutions as wound irrigants may reduce postoperative infection rates by killing bacteria which contaminate the surface of the wound during operation.

AB  - Evidence is presented that the pathogens causing urinary infection in boys differ significantly from those causing infection in girls and in adult males. Studies of the prepuce floria in boys known to have had urinary infection and in matched controls suggest that the focus of infection is in the preputial sac or urethra rather than the bowel as in girls. It is suggested that the difference in infecting organisms in boys and in adult males may be related to prostatic secretion.

TI  - Infection following total hip replacement in a general hospital without special orthopaedic facilities.
AB  - Infection following total hip replacement is a serious complication for it is frequently impossible to resolve without removal of the prosthesis. We have reviewed 321 total hip replacements undertaken in a general hospital without special orthopaedic theatres. There were 17 deep infections, nine early and eight late. Athough the diagnosis of early infection is usually not difficult, the differentiation between late infections, mechanical failure and metal sensitivity may be a problem. This paper discusses the use of ESR, radiographs, isolation of pathogenic organisms and bone scanning in reaching the diagnosis of infection of the hip. There is possibly a parallel between prosthetic infection and subacute bacterial endocarditis. Therefore all intercurrent infections and episodes of trauma should be given an adequate course of a broad spectrum antibiotic. Sterile air and laminar flow systems are discussed and compared with prophylactic antibiotics, both systemic and local, in attempting to reduce the overall rate of infection following total replacement of the hip.

TI  - Adherence of bacteria to heart valves in vitro.
AB  - The abilities of 14 strains of aerobic gram-positive cocci and gram-negative bacilli to adhere in vitro to human or canine aortic valve leaflets were compared. 2-mm sections of excised valve leaflets were obtained by punch biopsy and were incubated under standardized conditions in suspensions of bacteria. Valve sections were subsequently washed and homogenized, and quantitative techniques were used to determine the proportions of bacteria from the initial suspensions that had adhered to the valve sections. Comparable results were obtained when these adherence ratios were determined by two independent methods based either on measurements of bacterial viability or of radioactivity in 51Cr-labeled bacteria. For each bacterial strain, the adherence ratio was constant over a wide range of concentrations of bacteria in the incubation medium. Strains of enterococci, viridans streptococci, coagulase-positive and coagulase-negative staphylococci and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (adherence ratios 0.003-0.017) were found to adhere more readily to valve sections than strains of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae (adherence ratios 0.00002-0.00004). The organisms that most frequently cause bacterial endocarditis were found to adhere best to heart valves in vitro, suggesting that the ability to adhere to valvular endothelium may be an important or essential charcteristic of bacteria that cause endocarditis in man.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of human peritoneal fluid.
AB  - Cell free peritoneal fluids from 23 normal women had antimicrobial activity which was directed against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and also against yeasts. The activity was bacteriostatic or bactericidal and seemed to be due to the presence of a variety of factors which varied in their heat stability and dependence on complement. Lysozyme was present in the fluids but was not responsible for all the antimicrobial activity.
TI  - [Effect of levomycetin on the microflora artificially introduced into the intestines of gnotobiotic chicks].
AB  - Levomycetin effect on the microflora introduced into the intestine of abiotic chickens was studied. Levomycetin in a dose of 4 mg perosone chicken for 5 days provided a decrease in the number of Bifidobacteria, Lactobacteria, Escherichia and Enterococci by 100 to 10000 times and an increase in the number of Candida or disbacteriosis in the intestine. The highest effect was observed with respect to multiplication of Lactobacteria. This impaired the ecological quantitative ratio between the microorganisms. Re-establishment of the microbial biocenosis after discontinuation of levomycetin use was not complete. Repeated disbacteriosis in the gastrointestinal tract of the test-chickens was registered on the 16th day.
TI  - The faecal flora in ulcerative colitis.
AB  - Differential counts of the faecal flora of patients with ulcerative colitis showed a dysbiotic flora with a 100-fold increase of group-D streptococci and a reduction of bifidobacteria in comparison with the stable eubiotic flora of healthy subjects. The increase in number in group-D streptococci was accompanied by an increase in variety. About four different varieties of enterococci were found in faeces from patients compared with one or two in samples from healthy subjects. The strains isolated from patients were more active in mucin breakdown, and only strains from patients were able to break down hyaluronic acid. Lactic acid could be formed from these substrates. The increased secretion of mucin in colitis and the presence of unprotected hyaluronic acid in ulcers seem to select these organisms which are probably the cause of the high lactic-acid content of the faeces in such patients.
TI  - Seasonal occurrence and distribution of microbial indicators and pathogens in the Rhode River of Chesapeake Bay.
AB  - The seasonal incidence and occurrence of indicator organisms and pathogens were studied at four sites in the Rhode River, a subestuary of Chesapeake Bay. The highest frequency of occurrence of total and fecal coliforms and fecal streptococci was in Muddy Creek, a marsh area receiving pasture land runoff. Second highest frequency of occurrence of these bacteria was in Cadle Creek, a populated area. Lowest measurements of these parameters were obtained at stations in the central portion of the Rhode River. No Salmonella spp. were detected by the methods employed in this study. However, it is concluded that if these organisms are present, the concentrations are less than or equal to 1 organism per liter. The presence of Clostridium botulinum was detected in 12% of the samples tested.
TI  - Selective adhesion of microorganisms to the ductular epithelium of the bovine mammary gland.
AB  - Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Corynebacterium bovis were examined for their ability to adhere to the ductular epithelial cells of the bovine udder. S. agalactiae and S. aureus adhered readily and in large numbers, whereas the other organisms adhered poorly or not at all. The organisms showing the ability to adhere are those which frequently cause mastitis. These data suggest that selective adherence to the ductular epithelium may be the first stage in the pathogenesis of streptococcal and staphylococcal mastitis.
TI  - Nucleic acid related compounds. 17.3-Deazuridine. Stannous chloride catalysis of  cis-diol vs. phenolic base methylation with diazomethane.
AB  - Treatment of a methanolic solution of 4-hydroxy-1-beta-D-ribofuranosyl-2-pyridinone (3-deazauridine, 1) with diazomethane gave 2-methoxy-1-beta-D-ribofuranosyl-4-pyridinone (2) and 4-methoxy-1-beta-D-ribofuranosyl-2-pyridinone (3a) in an approximate ratio of 1:2. Analogous treatment of 1 with diazomethane in the presence of stannous chloride dihydrate gave eight detected products including 2, 2-methoxy-1-(2-O-methyl-beta-D-ribofuranosyl)-4-phridinone (4), 2-methoxy-1-(3-O-methyl-beta-D-ribofuranosyl)-4-pyridinone (5), 3a, 4-methoxy-1-(2-O-methyl-beta-D-ribofuranosyl)-2-pyridinone (6a), 4-methoxy-1-(3-O-methoxy-beta-D-ribofuranosyl)-2-pyridinone (7a), 2'-O-methyl-3-deazauridine (6b), and 3'-O-methyl-3-deazauridine (7b). For comparison, the 2'-O-methyl derivatives of 2 )4 and 5) and of 3a (6a and 7a), respectively, were prepared in good overall yields by stannous chloride catalyzed methylation of 2 and 3a. Treatment of 1 with benzyl bromide gave 4-benzyloxy-1-beta-D-ribofuranosyl-2-pyridinone (3b). Stannous chloride catalyzed methylation of 4-pivaloxy-1-beta-D-ribofuranosyl-2-pyridinone (3c) gave the corresponding 2'-O-methyl derivative 6c. These compounds were tested in leukemia L1210 culture and against three bacterial strains and were found to be uniformly inactive. This provides a striking example of nucleoside structure specificity and also adds support to the depot storage-enzymic cleavage mode of antileukemic activity of 4-(adamantane-1-carbonyloxy)-1-beta-D-ribofuranosyl-2-pyridinone (3d).
TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial properties of methylsulfinyl and methylsulfonyl analongs of some nitrofurans.
AB  - The sulfoxides 5-methylsulfinyl-2-furaldehyde semicarbazone (2) and 1-[(5-methylsulfinyl-2-fufurylidene)amino]hydantoin (3) as well as the sulfones 1-[(5-methylsulfonyl-2-furfurylidene)animo]hydantoin (1) and 1-(5-methylsulfonly-2-furyl)-2-(6-amino-3-p-ridazyl)ethylene hydrochloride (4) have been prepared and tested for antibacterial activity against a number of gram-negative and gram-positive organisms. The compounds are much less active than the corresponding 5-nitrofuran derivatives, possibly because their reduction potentials are too negative for them to interfere with reductive enzyme systems within the bacteria.
TI  - Bacterial growth in seafoood on restaurant premises.
AB  - Operational guidelines for a chain of the newer type of seafood restaurants and take-out stores were derived from plots of bacteriological and trimethylamine changes during the preparation and storage of cod fillets, shrimp, and clams. If fish is to be defrosted at room temperature it should be washed and portioned within 14 h. Subsequent storage at 5 degrees C should not exceed 72 h and once removed from the refrigerator it should be fried within 3 h. New stores should consider improved methods of defrosting. Trimethylamine content was a more sensitive measure of quality loss than bacterial growth. Shrimp quality can be improved by emphasizing the way shells are removed because most of the contamination was external. Shrimp shelled while still frozen had the best potential keeping quality. Clam meat is handled less and is always held at 5 degrees C; but bacterial growth indicated that it should not be held on the premises for more than 3 days including the time necessary for defrosting. Batter prepared fresh daily can be feft at room temperature. Frying can obliterate poor handling procedures, but adequate cooking is essential under any conditions. Clams are a gourmet item but the practice of cooking them lightly at customer request proved inadvisable.
TI  - Prophylactic interparietal povidone-iodine in abdominal surgery.
AB  - This study sought to determine in a district general hospital (a) the frequency and nature of bacterial contamination at operation, (b) the incidence of consequent infection and (c) the prophylactic effect, if any, of interparietal povidone-iodine against postoperative wound infection. Bacterial contamination was shown in 49 per cent of all the abdominal surgical wounds at the end of operation. From 61 per cent of the subsequently infected wounds, organisms identified as contaminants at operation were again found. Interparietal instillation of povidone-iodine resulted in a statistically significant reduction in wound infection (P less than 0.01) in treated patients compared with untreated, randomized, matched controls. It was of significant value in cases of intestinal resection and peritonitis, in obese patients and in those with paramedian incisions. Laboratory studies indicate that povidone-iodine does not induce bacterial resistance. This chemical antibacterial agent may thus provide a preferable alternative to antibiotics in preventing such infections.
TI  - Distribution and significance of fecal indicator organisms in the Upper Chesapeake Bay.
AB  - Total viable aerobic, heterotrophic bacteria, total coliforms, fecal coliforms, and fecal streptococci were enumerated in samples collected at five stations located in the Upper Chesapeake Bay, December 1973 through December 1974. Significant levels of pollution indicator organisms were detected at all of the stations sampled. Highest counts were observed in samples collected at the confluence of the Susquehanna River and the Chesapeake Bay. The indicator organisms examined were observed to be quantitatively distributed independently of temperature and salinity. Counts were not found to be correlated with concentration of suspended sediment. However, significant proportions of both the total viable bacteria (53%) and fecal indicator organisms (greater than 80%) were directly associated with suspended sediments. Correlation coefficinets (r) for the indicator organisms examined in this study ranged from r = 0.80 to r = 0.99 for bottom water and suspended sediment, respectively. Prolonged survival of fecal streptococci in most of the sediment samples was observed, with concomitant reduction of the correlation coefficient from r = 0.99, fecal streptocicci to total coliforms in water, to r = 0.01, fecal streptococci to fecal coliforms in sediments. The results of this study compared favorably with fecal coliforms: fecal streptococci ratios for the various sample types. Characterization of organisms beyond the confirmed most-probable-number procedure provided good correlation between bacterial indicator groups.
TI  - Evaluation of a most-probable-number technique for the enumeration of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - A most-probable-number (MPN) technique was evaluated for detecting and enumerating Pseudomonas aeruginosa in water and wastewater. Both the presumptive and confirmatory media, as described in the 13th edition of Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater, as well as modifications of these media were included in evaluations. Various samples of water were tested, namely chlorinated tap water, creek water, and influent to a wastewater treatment plant. Modified media repeatedly gave higher estimated MPNs of P. aeruginosa than media listed in Standard Methods. P. aeruginosa was detected and recovered from all creek water and wastewater samples, but not from tap water samples tested. This organism was determined to be present in as large numbers as the fecal coliforms and in even greater quantities than the fecal streptococci in all samples, whenever MPN estimations were determined from those positive tubes containing the modified confirmatory medium.
TI  - [Microbiological study of gentamiycin].
AB  - Gentamycin prepared at the All-Union Research Institute of Antibiotics did not differ by its antibacterial spectrum and the activity level from gentamycin samples from other countries. By its activity against clinical strains of Ps. aeruginosa gentamycin was somewhat inferior than polymyxin but much more superior than carbenicillin. An agar-diffusion method using Bac. pumilus NTCC 8241 as the test microbe was developed for determination of gentamycin activity. The gentamycin sulfate complex and the components of gentamycin had the same activity levels, antibacterial spectrum and diffusion capacity.

AB  - Survival times for enteric bacteria and fecal streptococci were investigated using filter-sterilized water from a northern Illinois river and temperatures of 0 degrees, 5 degrees, 10 degrees, and 20 degrees C. Survival of Salmonella typhimurium was essentially the same as Escherichia coli over normal seasonal temperatures. Fecal streptococci generally exhibited classic survival patterns.
TI  - Relationship between various bacterial populations and coprostanol and cholesterol.
AB  - A year-long study was conducted at three different locations in Canada to evaluate the relationship between fecal sterols and bacterial populations. A statistical model was constructed to study the following: (i) seasonal variations in the sterols and bacterial parameters; (ii) the differences between morning and afternoon samples; (iii) the relationship between the two sterols (coprostanol and cholesterol) as well as their relationship to the bacterial parameters; and (iv) the geographical differences between the three sampling sites. Application of the model to the data indicated that (i) the relationship in receiving waters between coprostanol and cholesterol was found to be highly significant; (ii) at two sampling sites the relationship between fecal sterols and fecal coliforms was positively significant at the 5% level; (iii) at one sampling site there was a positive relationship between fecal sterols and the fecal coliform - fecal streptococcus ratio; and (iv) in a.m. vs. p.m. samples significant differences were noted in coliform, fecal coliform, and fecal streptococcus densities while no significant differences were found in heterotroph densities and coprostanol and cholesterol levels. Raw and treated sewage from four sewage-treatment plants were also studied to provide baseline control data. Data support the conclusion that while no consistent relationship exists between bacterial parameters and fecal sterols, fecal sterols could be considered as unequivocal indicators of the presence of fecal material in water.

AB  - A study was made of biological purification of sewage at the aeration stations on the quantitative composition of the main indicator microbes--of bacteria of the coliform group and of the fecal coliform bacilli, enterococci, Proteus, and also pathogenic enterobacteria. There was found a difference in the behaviour of different species of Proteus, i.e. reduction in the process of purification in the numbers of Pr. mirabilis, and a sharp elevation of Pr. morganii content. There was noted an insignificant amount of Pr. vulgaris both before and after the biological purification. It was found that dynamics of biocenosis was influenced by air temperature at the time of collection of the samples. A possibility of reproduction of coliform bacilli serving as one of the factors of autopurification of sewage during the biological purification was confirmed.
TI  - [Microflora and immunity in surgical patients. I. Some microfloral indices in the pre- and postoperative periods].
AB  - Surgical treatment can lead to the appearance of a purulent staphylococcus infection of endogenous etiology. Endogenous infection originates as a result of the patient's diminished resistance, indicated by an increase in the number of pathogenic staphylococci, the appearance of representatives of the intestinal flora in the oral cavity and on the surface of the skin. No iogenous purulent infection.
TI  - Studies on the establishment of multi-drug-resistant strain BIO-4R of Streptococcus faecalis in the intestinal tract of germ-free mice. Bacterial interaction and effect of antibiotics.
AB  - Germ-free ICR mice were mono- or dicontaminated with a multi-drug-resistant strain BIO-4R of Streptococcus faecalis (BIO-4R) and Escherichia coli 026 : K60 (E. coli) and administered aminobenzyl penicillin (ABPC). BIO-4R was established in the intestinal tract at a level of 10(8) viable cells per gram of stool on the fourth day following oral inoculation and the BIO-4R population was stably maintained thereafter. The drug resistance of BIO-4R remained unchanged in the intestinal tract of gnotobiotes throughout the experiment. Highly resistant cells of E. coli were isolated from the feces of some dicontaminated mice after ABPC administration. However, it seems that the high resistance of these E. coli is not due to the transfer of resistance of BIO-4R to E. coli. All animals given a large amount of BIO-4R (10(8) cells) per os survived throughout the study period of two weeks without symptoms.
TI  - Detection of bacteriuria in pediatric outpatients. A new culture device.
AB  - Urine samples from 1,003 pediatric patients were examined for bacteriuria with a  culture-nitrite strip test, along with microscopic assessment of pyruia and conventional chemical analysis. The latter two methods proved of little value in reliably detecting or excluding substantial bacteriuria. An overall prevalence of 5.2% was shown. Using Microstix Reagent Strips, 92 urine samples with substantial colony counts were detected. Subculture from the strips disclosed that 52 of these involved single pathogens, interpreted as true bacteriuria. When Microstix growth results were compared with the calibrated loop method on 108 randomly selected specimens, the strip gave only two false negatives and one false positive. Bacteriuria screening should be done in high-risk groups and in asymptomatic children as part of the health evaluation. The index of suspicion should be higher in girls, and reliable interpretation of culture results requires attention to proper specimen collection.
TI  - Synthesis and biological activity of 5-fluoro-4'-thiouridine and some related nucleosides.
AB  - The synthesis of a series of 4'-thio-5-halogenopyrimidine nucleosides, including  the 5-fluoro, chloro, bromo and iodo derivatives, has been carried out by condensation of the 2,4-bis-O-trimethylsilyl derivatives of the corresponding pyrimidine bases with the protected 4-thio-D-ribofuranosyl chloride. Among these, the alpha and beta anomers of 4'-thio-5-fluorouridine inhibited the growth of leukemia L1210 cells at concentrations of 4 x 10(-7) and 2 x 10(-7) M, respectively, and that of S. faecium at 4 x 10(-9) and 6 x 10(-10) M, respectively. These compounds retained marked activity against strains of S. faecium resistant to 10(-3) M 5-fluorouracil or 5-fluorouridine. As determined in S. faecium cultures, 4'-thio-5-fluorouridine decreased the total protein content of the cells more markedly than it did their RNA or DNA content. X-Ray crystallography showed that substitution of sulfur for the oxygen in the carbohydrate ring markedly changes the conformation of that moiety.
TI  - Competitive effects of intestinal microflora on Vibrio cholerae in gnotobiotic mice.
AB  - The coexistence of Vibrio cholerae and several intestinal bacteria was determined in gnotobiotic mice. The bacteria tested included a Bacteroides sp, Clostridium difficile, Clostridium perfringens type A, 2 separate isolates of Escherichia coli, 2 different Lactobacilli, 2 separate isolates of Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas maltophilia, and Streptococcus faecalis. Each species of bacteria became established and was recovered repeatedly from the stools during the studies. No single strain or species was found that would eliminate V cholerae from these mice within 2 wk. Not until a combination of E coli, P mirabilis, and S faecalis was present in the mice did V cholerae disappear from the stools in 14 da.
TI  - Studies of introital colonization in women with recurrent urinary infections. I.  The role of vaginal pH.
AB  - The pH of the vaginal introitus was compared to quantitative cultures of the introital mucosa (Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Streptococcus faecalis) in 800 samples. Introital carriage of more than 100 bacteria per ml. was significantly greater at pH of more than 4.4 (p less than 0.005) when compared to mucosal pH of less than or equal to 4.4.
TI  - Comparative inhibitory activity of BL-S640 and two other cephalosporins.
AB  - In vitro antibacterial activity of BL-S640 was compared to that of cephalothin and cephalexin against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria isolated from clinical specimens. BL-S640 demonstrated the best activity on nearly all microbial species studied, except for Haemophilus influenzae and Diplococcus pneumoniae against which cephalothin was slightly more active.
TI  - Survival of human enteric and other sewage microorganisms under simulated deep-sea conditions.
AB  - The survival of pure cultures of Escherichia coli, Streptococcus faecalis, Clostridium perfringens, and Vibrio parahaemolyticus under simulated deep-sea conditions of low temperature (4 C), seawater, and hydrostatic pressures ranging from 1 to 1,000 atm was determined over a period exceeding 300 h. The viability of E. coli and total aerobic bacteria in seawater-diluted raw sewage subjected to these deep-sea conditions was also measured. There was a greater survival of both E. coli and S. faecalis at 250 and 500 atm than at 1 atm at 4 C. S. faecalis was quite insensitive to 1,000 atm, whereas with E. coli there was a 10-fold die-off per 50-h exposure to 1,000 atm. In contrast, V. parahaemolyticus and C. perfringens were quite sensitive to pressures exceeding 250 atm, and with both of these species there was a total loss of viability of approximately 10(8) cells per ml within 100 h at 1,000 arm and within 200 h at 500 atm. The viability of the naturally occurring fecal coliforms in sewage exposed to moderate pressures at 4 C was found to be similar to the survival patterns demonstrated with pure cultures of E. coli. The total numbers of aerobic bacteria in these sewage samples, however, stabilized at 500 and 1,000 atm after 100 h, and at 1 and 250 atm there was significant growth of sewage-associated bacteria, which apparently utilized the organic compounds in the seawater-diluted sewage samples. A preliminary classification of some of these bacteria indicated that approximately 90% (160 isolates) of the organisms that survived over a 400-h exposure to 500 and 1,000 atm were Arthrobacter/Corynebacterium species, and the representative organisms capable of growing at 1 and 250 atm in seawater at 4 C were gram-positive cellulose digesters and an unidentified gram-negative coccus. The significance of these results with respect to the contamination of the deep ocean with human pathogens and the possibility of sewage-associated microorganisms growing and competing with indigenous marine microbial flora in situ is discussed.
TI  - Relationship of bacterial infection in urine and calculi to canine urolithiasis.
AB  - In 26 dogs treated surgically for urolithiasis, bacteriological examination of the urine and the interior of calculi showed that infection was present in both materials in 14 cases. Infection with phosphate calculi, present in 13 of these 14 dogs, was associated with a variety of bacteria including Staphylococcus aureus, Staph epidermidis, Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli and Proteus spp. In a follow-up examination of 16 dogs, organisms different from the original isolates were recovered from some cases. The significance of the persistence of viable bacteria within canine bladder calculi is discussed.

AB  - The synthesis, microbiological profile and in vivo effectiveness in laboratory animals of a series of cephalosporins having 7-acyl substituents derived from methylthioacetic acid are described. Structure-activity relationships examined include the effect of oxidation of the side-chain sulfur atom, replacement of the (side-chain) methyl hydrogens by fluorine and replacement of the 3-acetoxy substituent by thioheterocycles. One derivative, 7-trifluoromethylthioacetamido-3-(1-methyl-1H-tetrazol-5-ylthiomethyl)-3-cephem-4 -carboxylic acid (SK&F 59962), was found to have outstanding antibacterial activity in vitro and in vivo.
TI  - A critical look at chemical disinfection of anaesthetic apparatus.
AB  - Studies were carried out to test the efficacy of disinfection of a previously contaminated corrugated anaesthetic tube and reservoir bag. Bacteriological swabs and sampling with broth were evaluated as methods of detecting contamination. Gross contamination was detected by broth sampling on occasions when swabbing failed to reveal contamination. The presence of up to 18% by volume of residual air within the apparatus was detected. A method of ensuring elimination of all air is described and studies showed that disinfection was then complete.
TI  - Bacteriology of the gallbladder bile in normal subjects.
AB  - A bacteriologic analysis of the gallbladder bile in eighty patients who underwent operation was performed in a prospective study. In all twenty patients with a normal gallbladder as assessed by oral cholecystography and intraoperative palpation, cultured were negative. Among patients with chronic cholecystitis only 30 per cent had positive bile cultures and this rose to 47 per cent among patients with acute cholecystitis.
TI  - [Clinical study with Spectacillin on patients with infections of the urogenital system (author's transl)].
AB  - Report is given of clinical experiences gained with the new developed semi-syntheticpenicillin "Spectacillin" on 75 patients suffering from an urological disease. The drug has been applied for therapy of acute and chronic forms of inflammations of the bladder and the urethra, additionally the prostatitis, the epididymitis, but first of all the pyelonephritis (caused bacterially). Within the germ spectrum of these diseases, germs of the coli-type, streptococcus faecalis (enterococcus), staphylococcus aureus, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, proteus, pseudomonas and aerobacter were found. Patients with acute/subacute diseases have been treated 8 to 9 days (3-4 grams per day) on an average; in case of chronic diseases, the patients received initially 1 gram a day and thereupon during 3 to 4 weeks 3 to 4 grams per day. The well-succeeded results have been documentated by means of the clinical course, the germ-elimination and the laboratory findings. The exanthematous quote may be demonstrated as remarkably low, considering the good universal compatibility of the substance. For this reason "Spectacillin" not finally is suitable for treatment of acute and chronic infections of the urogenital systems.
TI  - Substituted 1-[(5-nitrofurfurylidene)amino]-4-imidazolin-2-ones.
AB  - A series of 1-[(5-nitrofurfurylidene)amino]-4-imidazolin-2-ones has been prepared. A new synthesis of 4-alkyl-1-[(5-nitrofurfurylidene)amino]-4-imidazolin-2-ones involving the oxidative ring closure of 5-nitro-2-furaldehyde 2-(2-hydroxyethylalkyl)semicarbazones is described. The in vitro testing of the compounds against a variety of bacteria is reported.
TI  - Effect of sodium cyanate upon the function of normal human polymorphonuclaer leukocytes.
AB  - Sodium cyanate, a drug that prevents sickling of hemoglobin S by virtue of its irreversible carbamylation of the N-terminal amino group of valine, was studied for its effect upon the function of normal human polymorphonuclear luekocytes. In concentrations of 500 and 100 mug/ml, sodium cyanate was found to inhibit killing by neutrophils of Staphylococcus epidermidis and Eschierichia coli but not of Streptococcus faecalis. Viability of cells and phagocytosis were not affected by cyanate; however, production of [14-C] carbon dioxide from [1-14-C] glucose and the iodination of 125-I during phagocytosis were significantly impaired. Cyanate is thought to inbibit the bacterixidal activity of neutrophils by interfering with the oxidative metabolism of gluxose via the hexose monophosphate shunt (theraby decreasing production of H-2-O-2) and by inbibiting iodination of ingested bacteria (either by competing with iodide as the oxidizable cofactor or by inhibiting myeloperoxidase). Since these effects of cyanate were all reversible by washing the nurtrophils free of the drug, it is unlikely that they are due to amino carbamylation.
TI  - Enzymatic adaptation by bacteria under pressure.
AB  - A study of enzymic adaptation under hydrostatic pressure by moderately barotolerant bacteria that can grow at pressure up to about 500 atm revealed that some adaptive processes are relatively insensitive to pressure, whereas others are sufficiently barosensitive to compromise survival capacity in situations requiring adaptation to new substrates under pressure. Examples of the former include adaptation of Escherichia coli to arabinose catabolism for growth and adaptation of Streptococcus faecalis to catabolism of lactose, ribose, or maltose. Examples of the latter include derepression of the lac operon in Escherichia coli and induction of penicillinase synthesis by Bacillus licheniformis. For both these barosensitive systems, pressure had little effect on enzyme levels in constitutive strains or in bacteria that had previously been induced at 1 atm. Moreover, it had no detectable effect on penicillinase secretion. However, pressures of 300 to 400 atm were found to reduce markedly rates and extents of enzyme synthesis by bacteria undergoing derepression or adaptation. This inhibitory effect of pressure was reflected in greater barosensitivity with extended lag and slower growth of initially unadapted Escherichia coli cells inoculated into minimal medium with lactose as sole source of carbon and fuel, and by major reductions in the minimal inhibitory concentrations of penicillin G for unadapted B. licheniformis cells inoculated into complex, antibiotic-containing media. Cyclic adenosine 5'-monophosphate did not reverse pressure inhibition of derepression of the lac operon, and catabolite repression was complete under pressure. However, derepression of the lac operon was more sensitive to pressure at low concentrations of inducer than at high concentrations. Apparent volume changes for derepression were 94 and 60 ml/mol at inducer concentrations of about 0.5 and 5 mM, respectively. Pressure was found not to be inhibitory for uptake of beta-galactosides; in fact, it was somewhat stimulatory. Therefore, results were interpreted in terms of inducer binding and subsequent conversion of an operator-inducer-repressor complex to inactive repressor and operator. Both reactions appeared to result in an increase in volume, the former more so than the latter. We found also that 200 atm was actually stimulatory for growth of Escherichia coli in minimal media, and the bacterium was in a sense barophilic.
TI  - Distribution of indigenous bacteria in the digestive tract of conventional and gnotobiotic rats.
AB  - The localization and population levels of the indigenous bacterial flora of conventional rats were investigated by cultural and histological techniques. Lactobacilli predominate in the stomach and upper part of the small intestine and associate with keratinized cells of the nonglandular portion of stomach. Mixtures of varying complexity of pure cultures of indigenous bacteria were inoculated into germfree rats. The distribution of these bacteria was examined to investigate the effect of lactobacilli in controlling the composition of other bacterial species in each portion of the digestive tract. In the stomach and the upper part of the small intestine, lactobacilli controlled the population levels of other bacterial species. In the lower part of the small intestine, not only lactobacilli but also the anaerobes which colonized the large bowel influenced the population levels of other bacterial types. Staphylococci isolated from a conventional rat colonized specifically the keratinized cells of the nonsecreting epithelium of the stomach when the rats were free from lactobacilli. This colonization was not observed after inoculation of lactobacilli into the rats.

TI  - Effects of cadmium on the growth and uptake of cadmium by microorganisms.
AB  - Six species of microorganisms, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis and Actinomyces niger, were grown under suitable conditions in appropriate media. Cadmium chloride was added to provide 0, 5, 10, 20, 40, and 80 mug of Cd per ml. At 40 and 80 mug of Cd per ml, E. coli and B. cereus grew well and the other species were repressed. Cd uptake patterns differed significantly among the species tested. The significance of these data with respect to Cd in food chains is discussed.
TI  - [Experimental investigations concerning spectrum, serum concentration, and excretion of Spectacillin (author's transl)].
AB  - By means of the diffusion test, the range of action of the ampicillin successive  preparation spectacillin was determined using 12 000 pathological germs freshly isolated from in-patients. The result was a range of action similar to that of ampicillin. A comparison, however, is only possible in case the test platelets (without over-dosage) are each charged with exactly, e.g., 25 gamma. The analyses of serum concentrations have shown that spectacillin is satisfactorily absorbed after oral as well as after parenteral application. Thus, the calculation of the accumulated area of infinity beneath the serum concentration curve had the following results: After single intravenous injection of 1 g spectacillin (n equals 12) 51.46 gamma/ml - h; after single intravenous injection of 2 g spectacillin 86.20 gamma/ml - h; after intramuscular injection (twice) - interval of 12 hours - 29.94 gamma/ml - h after 12 hours; same values as before, but after 24 hours, 29.37 gamma/ml - h. After a single oral application of one capsule of spectacillin (capsule equals 500 mg), the value of the accumulated area was 8.46 gamma/ml - h. In analogy of the good absorption, excretion in urine/24 hrs (after application of 1 g spectacillin intravenously) was 61.74 p.c., after 2 g i.v. 54.30 p.c., and after applying twice 1 g spectacillin intramuscularly 61.40 p.c.; after oral application of 500 mg, the percentage was 28.42. Tolerance of spectacillin was good after oral as well as after parenteral application. No side effects were observed.
TI  - [Studies to the in-vitro-effectiveness of Spectacillin (author's transl)].
AB  - In this study the sensibility of important disease germs of a clinical and an ambulatory test material has been investigated to the substances "Epicillin" and "Ampicillin". Thereby could be found that 67% (43%) of the E. coli and 55% (36%) of the proteus type, as well as 96% (96%) of the enterococcus type of the ambulatory (clinical) test material were sensitive to Epicillin and Ampicillin. Staphylococcus not producing penicillinase, were well-sensitive, while staphylococcus producing penicillinase, contrarily showed to be insensitive. Salmonellae proved to be well-sensitive up to 97%, and the rest left was limited sensitive. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) resulted in favourable findings for enterococcus, staphylococcus aureus and salmonellae; at a corresponding sensibility the same is valid for E. coli and the proteus. The investigations carried out in-vitro, reveal an equal effectiveness of Epicillin and Ampicillin.
TI  - Some observations on the caecal microflora of the chick during the first two weeks of life.
AB  - 1. Changes in the caecal flora of chicks aged from approximately 3 h to 14 d were studied. 2. Counts obtained by means of a conventional anaerobic plating method and a method for the stricter anaerobes remained comparable throughout but occasionally it was found that strains of anaerobic bacteria isolated from the predominant flora of 4- to 14-d-old birds could not be grown when tested by the conventional method. 3. During the 14-d period approximately 100% of the organisms isolated on anaerobic plates utilised uric acid up to the third day but the incidence subsequently declined and in one case represented only 4% of the total flora. 4. The predominant uric acid-utilising bacteria were Streptococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli up to 3 d of age and various types of anaerobic bacteria thereafter. 5. None of the isolates showed an absolute requirement for uric acid.

TI  - Asymptomatic bacteriuria in schoolchildren in Newcastle upon Tyne.
AB  - A screening survey for asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) in 13464 schoolgirls aged 4 to 18 years in Newcastle upon Tyne showed an overall prevalence of 1.9%. In girls 4 to 6 years it was 1.4%, in girls aged 7 to 11 years it was 2.5%, in girls aged 12 to 18 years it was 1.6%, a statistically significant rise and fall. Renal scarring was found in 39 (15%) of 254 girls with ASB. Neither the prevalence nor the severity of renal scarring increased with age. There was no association between ASB and social class. Of the 254 girls with ASB, 24% had no symptoms. Infections with klebsiella were more frequently associated with renal scarring than infections with Esch. coli. The prevalence of ASB in 1595 boys aged 5 to 18 was low, 0.2%. Ureteric reflux was present in 15% of girls without renal scarring and in 46% of those with renal scarring (P less than 0.001). Renal scarring also showed a significant association with duplication, hydroureter, or single saccules in the bladder. The greater the severity of scarring the more frequently was reflux present. This study gave no evidence that asymptomatic bacteriuria leads to progressive renal damage during childhood. It therefore does not support the recommendation for prescriptive screening of schoolchildren, but emphasizes the need for prospective studies of the natural history of ASB.

TI  - Factors that may prevent transfer of anti-biotic resistance between gram-negative bacteria in the gut.
AB  - Antibiotic-resistance transfer between populations of donor and recipient strains of Escherichia coli was completely inhibited in broth by dense suspensions of Bacteroides fragilis. Comparable amounts of inert bacterial matter (for-molised suspensions of E. coli or B. fragilis), or smaller numbers of viable B. fragilis, Streptococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus albus, Neisseria catarrhalis, or solutions of sodium taurocholate or glycocholate were only moderately inhibitory. Anaeroboisis had no effect upon plasmid transfer. Population densities of enteric organisms in these studies were similar to those found in faeces. The presence of dense cultures of B. fragilis provide a satisfactory explanation for almost total inhibition of conjugation in the human gut. Other factors inhibiting conjugation to a lesser degree may reinforce the effect of B. fragilis in vivo. As well as selecting for resistant organisms, antibiotics may also indirectly increase populations of R factor-bearing organisms in the gut by interfering with the anaerobic flora and so permit an increase in the frequency of conjugation.
TI  - The effect of leukocyte hydrolases on bacteria. III. Bacteriolysis induced by extracts of different leukocyte populations and the inhibition of lysis by macromolecular substances.
AB  - The lysis of 14C-labeled bacteria by hydrolases of human and rabbit leukocytes was studied in vitro. While Staphylococcus albus, Streptococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus mutans were highly susceptible to lysis, Staphylococcus auresus was intermediate in its susecptibility to lysis by the leukocyte enzymes. Group A Streptococcus, Listeria monocytogenes, Shigella flexneri, Escherichia coli, and Mycobacterium smegmatis were very resistant to degradation by these enzymes. The lytic activity of leukocyte lysates from human and rabbit blood was probably due to acid hydrolases of polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Extracts of human blood monocytes and of rabbit peritoneal and lung macrophages were less lytic for the bacteria tested. Lymphocytes and platelet extracts were not bacteriolytic. The lytic effect of the leukocyte lysates was not inhibited by KCN or sodium azide, but was abolished to a large extent by cationic polyelectrolytes such as protamine sulfate, histone and leukocyte cationic proteins, and poly-lysine, as well as by the anionic polyelectrolytes such as heparin, chondroitin sulfate, DNA, carrageenin, alginate sulfate, dextran sulfate, and ploy-L-glutamic acid. Other potent inhibitors of bacteriolysis were trypan blue, congo red, phosphatidic acid, normal immunoglobulins, and components of streptococcal cell wall.

TI  - Influence of environmental stress on enumeration of indicator bacteria from natural waters.
AB  - The problems associated with recovery of pure cultures of Escherichia coli and Streptococcus faecalis from stream environments were examined utilizing membrane filter chambers. It was observed that upon exposure to the aquatic environment a significant proportion of cells lost their ability to produce colonies on a selective medium, yet retained this capability on a nutritionally rich, nonselective medium. Discrepancies in colony-forming units between nonselective and selective media indicated that a substantial portion of bacterial cells may become physiologically injured due to the environmental stress imposed by the aquatic environment. The extent of injury was observed to vary considerably among the eight different stream environments, since the amount of injury was not uniform for all types of water environments examined. It was observed that the injury acquired by a population of E. coli, during exposure to the aquatic environment, could be rapidly repaired in a nutritionally rich, nonselective medium. As the injured population of cells was exposed to the rich, nonselective broth, increasing proportions of cells were able to repair themselves such that they became insensitive to inhibitory agents in selective media.
TI  - The role of vaginal colonization with enterobacteriaceae in recurrent urinary infections.
AB  - Quantitative cultures of the vaginal introitus for Enterobacteriaceae, S. faecalis and P. aeruginosa were compared in 20 premenopausal normal women (200 cultures) to 198 consecutive cultures from 9 premenopausal women in between episodes of bacteriuria. Introital colonization in patients susceptible to urinary infections was significantly higher for E. coli (p equals 0.001), S. faecalis (p equals 0.001) and for the presence of any gram-negative pathogens (p equals less than 0.001). In addition, introital colonization with these bacteria occurred in larger numbers and persisted through consecutive cultures for longer periods in women with recurrent infections.
TI  - Studies on the vitamin nutrition of the cellular slime mould Dictyostelium discoideum.
AB  - Vitamin auxotrophs of Escherichia coli grown in the presence or absence of the corresponding vitamin were used as substrates for the growth of Dictyostelium discoideum strain Ax-2 in order to investigate some of the growth-factor requirements of this cellular slime mould. Compared with the growth yields observed on vitamin-sufficient auxotrophs and on a prototroph, the yields on lipoate-, folate-, thiamin- or biotin-depleted auxotrophs were low but could be restored by the addition of exogenous vitamin to the slime mould cultures. It is concluded that these four vitamins are essential nutrients for D. discoideum. Similar experiments with other auxotrophs were inconclusive, indicating either that the slime mould does not require pantothenate, nicotinate or vitamin B6 or that the strains of E. coli were insufficiently depleted to detect such requirements. It is also concluded that cobalamin is not an essential nutrient, since the myxamoebae grew well with E. coli which lacks this vitamin when grown in cobalamin-free media. Similar arguments suggest that ubiquinone and vitamin K are also non-essential.
TI  - A ten-year survey of bacteriuria in the Osaka university hospital.
AB  - 10 consecutive years of observation of the laboratory data of quantitative urinary bacterial culture in the Central Clinical Laboratory of Osaka University Hospital was made. The marked rise of Pseudomonas and other Enterobacteriaceae was clearly demonstrated. The difference in bacterial species in bacteriuria between inpatients and outpatients strongly suggests that the origin of infection was quite different. The disappearance of Staph. aureus as a causative agent was also demonstrated.

TI  - [Study of enterococci in milk].
AB  - Studied were a total of 270 samples of raw and pasteurized milk taken during the  various technologic states of pasteurized mild produced for consumption at the State Economic Enterprise "Serdica", establishing the enterococcus and coli titers. It was found that the enterococcus titer of the raw milk varies from 10(-3) up to 10(-6), and the titer of the pasteurized milk at the enterprise and upon delivery through its commercial channels is from 1 up to 10(-3). The enterococcus titer of milk that was pasteurized and was kept for 24 hours at 4-5 degrees C was found to range from 1 to 10(-3), and of milk kept at 18-22 degrees C --from (0(-1) to 10(-6). Full coincidence of the enterococcus titer with the values of the coli titer was found only for pasteurized milk kept under refrigerator conditions. Along with the coli titer the enterococcus one may be used as a subsidiary means in a more strict bacteriologic control, however, it may not be referred to as the only criterion replacing the coli values in the hygiene evaluation of milk. All species of enterococci in varying counts are established in both raw and pasteurized milk. Prevailing are the strains of the Str. faecium group -- 43.2 per cent, and those of the Str. faecalis group -- 24.6 per cent.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of human cervical mucus.
AB  - The antimicrobial property of human uterine cervical mucus was tested in three groups of women. Healthy women, using no contraception, women using an intrauterine device and women receiving hormonal treatment for contraception. Cervical mucus was taken on the 10th, 14th, 18th and 22nd day of the menstrual cycle. Cervical mucus had a strong inhibitory effect on the growth of Micrococcus lysodeicticus in all three groups. The strength of the inhibitory effect on the other microorganisms were in the following order: Staphylococcus albus, Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, Candida albicans, Streptococcus haemolyticus, Streptococcus faecalis. Use of an intrauterine device did not affect the antimicrobial effect of cervical mucus. The use of hormonal contraceptive canceled the antimicrobial effect on the series of microorganisms, with the exception of M. lysodeicticus. The maximum inhibitory effect occurred on the 14th day and declined toward the end of the menstrual cycle.
TI  - Vitamin B12 absorption in x-irradiated rats.
AB  - The effect of whole-body exposure of rats to a sub-lethal dose (400 rad) of x-rays on the absorptive capacity of intestinal mucosal cells for vitamin B12 has been studied. The rate of absorption of vitamin B12 from the intestinal loops is decreased in x-irradiated rat. Inclusion of gastric juice from normal rat does not improve the rate. A severe interference in the absorption and retention of orally fed (57-Co)-B12, as evidenced by low serum levels, decreased organ uptake and increased excretion, is observed. However, when the vitamin is administered intraperitoneally, its uptake by organs is not affected in the irradiated animal. This suggests that the observed morphological degeneration of mucosal cells in x-irradiated rats is the main reason for the malabsorption of vitamin B12. Atrophy of intestinal cells in the protein-fasted rat accentuates the adverse effects of radiation. A sharp drop in viable intestinal flora is observed within 24 h post-irradiation, but there is an increase after 3 days.
TI  - [Nature of bacteriocins].
AB  - The bacteriocins comprise a large, heterogeneous group of bactericidal substances produced by bacteria from widely differing species. The best known bacteriocins are the colicins. Some aspects of research on colicins are discussed especially their chemical nature and mode of action, and their genetic determinants.
TI  - Behaviour and indicator value of some microorganisms under conditions of soil contamination by pesticides.
AB  - The comparative effect of two organophosphorus pesticides (chlorophos and metaphos) on Escherichia coli, an enterococcus and Shigella organisms present in chernozem, podzolic, and loamy soils was investigated. A considerable level of resistance of the test organisms to the insecticides was established. This was expressed by their behaviour only changing on contamination of the soil samples with the insecticides in amounts considerably exceeding those used in natural conditions. Escherichia coli stand much closer to Shigella organisms than the enterococcus does as regards resistance to the insecticides studied. This allows Escherichia coli to be evaluated as an organism of hygienic value under conditions of soil contamination by pesticides. The enterococcus, in the present concrete case, was a less indicator microorganism than was Escherichia coli.
TI  - Qualitative assessment of midstream urine cultures in the detection of bacteriuria.
AB  - 3550 women attending cervical smear and family planning clinics have been screened for bacteriria. Suprapubic aspiration of urine was carried out in 131 patients from whom two consecutive midstream urine specimens contained either a pure growth of Gram positive cocci or a growth in which Gram negative bacilli predominated. 95 patients were found to have bacteriuria; in 93 the urine was infected with a Gram negative organism. Of 53 patients with a count of more than 10-5 Gram negative organisms per milliliter on two consecutive midstream urine samples, 48 (91%) had bacteriuria. However, 45 (48%) of the 93 patients with bacteriuria did not have two consecutive counts greater than 10-5 organisms per milliliter , and 10 (11%) had counts of less than 10-4 organisms per milliliter in at least one of the two midstream urine samples. It is concluded that midstream urine counts of less than 10-5 organisms per milliliter in which Gram negative bacilli predominate may be indicative of bacteriuria and should be confirmed by suprapubic aspiration.

TI  - Degradation of N-nitrosamines by intestinal bacteria.
AB  - A major proportion of bacterial types, common in the gastrointestinal tract of many animals and man, were active in degrading diphenylnitrosamine and dimethylnitrosamine, the former being degraded more rapidly than the latter. At low nitrosamine concentrations (is less than 0.05 micronmol/ml), approximately 55% of added diphenylnitrosamine, 30% of N-nitrosopyrrolidine, and 4% of dimethylnitrosamine were degraded. The route of nitrosamine metabolism by bacteria appears to be different from that proposed for breakdown by mammalian enzyme systems in that carbon dioxide and formate were not produced. In bacteria, the nitrosamines were converted to the parent amine and nitrite ion and, in addition, certain unidentified volatile metabolites were produced from dimethylnitrosamine by bacteria. The importance of bacteria in reducing the potential hazard to man of nitrosamines is discussed.
TI  - Synthesis and microbiological activities of some monohalogenated analogs of tyrosine.
AB  - 2-Chlorotyrosine and 2-bromotyrosine, as well as the previously reported 2-fluorotyrosine, were synthesized by hydrolysis of the condensation products from the appropriate benzyl bromide and ethyl acetamidomalonate and were compared with the corresponding 3-halotyrosines as growth inhibitors of Escherichia coli 9723, Streptococcus faecalis 8043 and Lactobacillus plantarum 8014. In contrast to the 2- and 3-fluorotyrosines which were equally effective as growth inhibitors, the 2-chloro- and 2-bromotyrosines were much more effective than the 3-chloro- and 3-bromotyrosines in inhibiting the growth of the three microorganisms. For each of the assay organisms, the growth inhibitions of all three 2-halotyrosines were reversed competitively in varying degrees by tyrosine.

TI  - Bacterial flora of the appendix fossa in appendicitis and postoperative wound infection.
AB  - Bacteria were isolated from 153 (47.5%) swabs of the appendix fossa in 322 patients undergoing appendicectomy. The commonest organism was Bacteroides species found in 78% of specimens. Other Gram-negative bacilli such as Klebsiella, or Enterobacter, and Esch. coli were present in 29 and 27% respectively. Gram-positive cocci were less frequently isolated.A positive culture was obtained more commonly in perforated appendicitis (79%) than where chronic fibrosis, lymphoid hyperplasia, or acute appendicitis was present or when the appendix was normal. Bacteroides was isolated twice as often in perforated appendicitis. The incidence of wound infection was 19% and varied according to the state of the appendix, being 63% in perforated appendicitis and 9.5% where lymphoid hyperplasia was present. Bacteroides was isolated from over 90% of the wound infections. In the patients with perforated appendicitis where effective chemotherapy was given the incidence of wound infection was 15% whereas in untreated or inappropriately treated patients it was over 50%. The isolation of bacteroides requires special precautions to be taken both in the collection of the specimen and laboratory culture. It is important that the chemotherapy of postappendicectomy infections include an antibiotic active against bacteroides.

TI  - Tests of disinfection by heat in a bedpan washing machine.
AB  - Tests of effectiveness of disinfection of metal and polypropylene bedpans were made in a washer fitted with a steam generator. Broth cultures of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, or Streptococcus faecalis (approximately 4 x 10(8) organisms) were sealed in lengths of capillary tubing and attached to the surface of the pans. In other tests, pans were contaminated with an artificial soil containing Str. faecalis (10(8) organisms/ml). In both series of tests, counts of surviving organisms were made at the end of the washing and disinfection cycle. The tests using capillary tubes showed that the Gram-negative bacilli were effectively killed, but not necessarily Gram-positive cocci. However, when incorporated in standard soil, Str. faecalis was killed or removed during the cycle. The results indicate that the disinfection process was effective for metal bedpans, but less so for polypropylene. Possible disadvantages and modification of the machine are suggested.
TI  - Comparison of autoclave and ethylene oxide-sterilized membrane filters used in water quality studies.
AB  - Autoclave and ethylene oxide-sterilized membrane filters manufactured by Gelman,  Millipore, and Sartorius were field tested for their recovery of total coliforms, fecal coliforms, fecal streptococci, and heterotrophs. The data were analyzed by using split-plot analysis of variance and significance tests. Membranes were also tested for pH and toxicity using Escherichia coli. The mean data summaries indicated that Gelman membrane filters generally produced the highest counts during the field studies. Statistical analyses of the March data showed that there were significant differences between membrane filters at 1% level; however, statistical analyses of June data revealed no significant differences except in total coliform recoveries. Toxicity tests at 35 C indicated that Gelman and Millipore autoclaved membrane filters were able to recover 92% of the test organisms. Toxicity tests performed at 44.5 C revealed that no membranes were able to recover more than 40% of the test organisms. Since differences were found in the ability of the three brands of membrane filters to recover bacteria from natural and controlled sources, membrane filters from different manufacturers cannot be readily interchanged. There is a need for a standardized procedure for testing bacterial recovery by membrane filters.

AB  - A square grid pattern, printed in hydrophobic material on conventional membrane filters, subdivided the surface into a plurality of areas. This separated colonies from one another and prevented lateral growth, spreading, and confluence. Very high colony-packing densities were achieved (2,500/in(2); ca. 1.61 x 10(5)/cm(2)) reducing the need to dilute samples. Recovery of organisms was better than on conventional filters, particularly at high inoculum levels. At the same time, visibility of normally pale or diffuse colonies was improved, since colonies grew upwards instead of sideways, and counting was facilitated because colonies grew in orderly arrays.

AB  - The effects of N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD) on the growth of Streptococcus faecalis, and on the growth, beta-galactosidase synthesis, and various membrane-mediated processes, were studied in wild-type Escherichia coli JE1011 and its lipopolysaccharide-defective mutant NS1. DCCD (0.1 mM) completely inhibited the growth of S. faecalis and E. coli NS1 but had little effect on strain JE1011. The same amount of DCCD with E. coli NS1, but not with E. coli JE1011, inhibited the induction of beta-galactosidase, increased the permeability of the cells to o-nitrophenyl-beta-d-galactoside without causing extensive cell lysis or release of ultraviolet-absorbing materials, and inhibited the oxidation of certain intermediates of the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Inhibition of the oxidation of malate, fumarate, and alpha-ketoglutarate by DCCD appeared to be at the level of the transport system for these compounds. Inhibition of the membrane-bound adenosine triphosphatase by DCCD was not entirely responsible for these effects, since oxidation of these substances, and transport of [(14)C]succinate and [(14)C]fumarate, was inhibited by DCCD in a mutant, N(144), which lacked adenosine triphosphatase activity. It is concluded that lipopolysaccharide forms a barrier to DCCD in wild-type E. coli, and that DCCD can inhibit several processes in the cell.

The studies have been undertaken at a chicken processing plant handling between 75,000 and 80,000 birds per day. Populations of salmonellae and indicator bacteria were estimated in the raw wastes, through the waste treatment plant, and in the receiving stream waters. The results demonstrate that salmonellae are present in poultry processing wastes in a surprisingly constant relation to fecal coliforms (in excess of 1 Salmonella per 500 fecal coliforms), that serotypes in the environment are constantly changing, and that they may reflect unusual conditions in the processing plant, or a possible source of infection among human and animal residents of the environment. Disinfection of poultry processing wastes is recommended.

AB  - The activity of cefoxitin was compared with that of cephalothin against 229 bacterial strains. Cefoxitin was more active against most Gram-negative strains, notably against indole-producing Proteus spp., which are usually resistant to the cephalosporins. Cefoxitin was not susceptible to any significant extent to degradation by beta-lactamases produced by Gram-negative organisms. Against Gram-positive organisms, however, cefoxitin was considerably less active than cephalothin, but minimum inhibitory concentrations for Staphylococcus aureus were well within therapeutically attainable blood levels.Pharmacokinetic studies in 18 volunteers showed a higher and longer sustained antibiotic activity in serum and urine after injections of cefoxitin than after equal doses of cephalothin. Urinary recovery of cefoxitin activity was also much higher than that of cephalothin. No evidence of toxicity due to cefoxitin was found. Cefoxitin was slightly less painful after intramuscular injection than cephalothin.

AB  - A "catheter team", consisting of two hospital assistants specially trained to catheterize male patients, inserted indwelling catheters in 435 men over a two-year period. The infection rate was 33%; in the 200 patients not treated with antimicrobial drugs (study group) the rate was 37%, while in the 235 patients who were so treated (antibacterial group) the infection rate was 29%. Fifty percent of patients not treated were infected after 6.3 days, whereas in patients on antibacterial therapy a 50% infection rate was not reached until 14 days after insertion. Therefore, no antibacterial therapy is necessary if it is anticipated that the catheter will be necessary for less than four days. On the other hand, prophylactic antibacterial therapy would delay the onset of infection considerably if catheterization were expected to continue for more than four days. Sulfisoxazole was our drug of choice for prophylactic treatment.

Total excretion of both acid and neutral steroids was also reduced. On cessation of the diet both faecal flora and faecal steroids reverted to levels before the diet.

AB  - Oxygen induces superoxide dismutase in Streptococcus faecalis and in Escherichia  coli B. S. faecalis grown under 20 atm of O(2) had 16 times more of this enzyme than did anaerobically grown cells. In the case of E. coli, changing the conditions of growth from anaerobic to 5 atm of O(2) caused a 25-fold increase in the level of superoxide dismutase. Induction of this enzyme was a response to O(2) rather than to pressure, since 20 atm of N(2) was without effect. Induction of superoxide dismutase was a rapid process, and half of the maximal level was reached within 90 min after N(2)-grown cells of S. faecalis were exposed to 20 atm of O(2) at 37 C. S. faecalis did not contain perceptible levels of catalase under any of the growth conditions investigated by Stanier, Doudoroff, and Adelberg (23), and the concentration of catalase in E. coli was not affected by the presence of O(2) during growth. S. faecalis, which had been grown under 100% O(2) and which therefore contained an elevated level of superoxide dismutase, was more resistant of 46 atm of O(2) than were cells which had been grown under N(2). E. coli grown under N(2) contained as much superoxide dismutase as did S. faecalis grown under 1 atm of O(2). The E. coli which had been grown under N(2) was as resistant to the deleterious effects of 50 atm of O(2) as was S. faecalis which had been grown under 1 atm of O(2). These results are consistent with the proposal that the peroxide radical is an important agent of the toxicity of oxygen and that superoxide dismutase may be a component of the systems which have been evolved to deal with this potential toxicity.
TI  - Recurrent urethritis in women.
AB  - The bacterial flora of the vestibule, urethra and vagina of a group of patients with recurrent urethritis, and of control subjects without symptoms, was investigated. Organisms regarded as pathogenic, such as enterobacteria and Streptococcus faecalis, were recovered significantly more frequently from patients than from controls, whereas the reverse was found for non-pathogenic organisms. The bacterial flora was similar in the three areas, suggesting that a specimen taken from one region only would give adequate bacteriological information. The vestibule is suggested as a suitable site. The incidence of vestibular pathogens was higher in postmenopausal patients. Perineal length and vestibular pH were very similar in patient and control groups. There was some evidence that in most subjects the bacterial flora of the areas investigated remains fairly constant over a period of several weeks. Although bacterial species commonly responsible for urinary tract infection may often cause recurrent urethritis, the absence of these pathogens from some patients suggests that the etiology of this condition is not yet fully understood.

AB  - The incidence of trimethoprim resistance in coliforms and multiresistant strains  of Staphylococcus aureus isolated in Bristol from 1970 to 1972 is low-2.3 and 1.0% respectively. The resistance is probably intrinsic; there is no evidence that it is R-factor or plasmid mediated. A single mechanism that confers resistance to both trimethoprim and sulphamethoxazole has not been detected. Normal growing one-step mutants of S. aureus and Escherichia coli resistant to trimethoprim could not be isolated in vitro. For these reasons cotrimoxazole should retain its usefulness against these bacteria for some years. However, contrimoxazole was found not to be bactericidal against many coliforms. The usefulness of cotrimoxazole against Streptococcus faecalis seems limited because mutants resistant to trimethoprim occurred at high frequency in one step.

AB  - The interaction of several common strains of bacteria with rabbit or human platelets in vitro has been examined sequentially with scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Bacteria were added to platelets in their native plasma or to washed platelets in a balanced salt solution at ratios of about 1:1 or at low bacteria to platelet ratios (down to 1:100). The platelet-bacterial interaction (PBI) was studied with recording nephelometry. Matched samples were fixed for microscopy at various points in the aggregation response. The results support these conclusions: a) Bacteria stimulate platelet aggregation by direct contact and adhesion with the platelet surface. b) Adhesion between the two cell types requires divalent cations, occurs through fusion of normal cell-surface coats and appears identical in the presence or absence of extracellular plasma protein. c) The morphologic transformation of platelets during PBI is identical to that produced by collagen. d) During PBI the bacteria are incorporated into the forming platelet aggregates and reside predominantly intercellularly. e) Phagocytosis of bacteria by a single platelet is very rare. f) Bacteria which have resided within platelet aggregates for one hour are unaltered morphologically. g) PBI occurs even at very low bacterial numbers and produces platelet-bacterial aggregates in small numbers without stimulating generalized platelet aggregation. Methods for concentration of thrombocytopenic plasma and washing human platelets are presented.

Seventy-five per cent of the samples showed total counts in the range of 100-10,000 organisms per gm. Of potential food poisoning organisms, coagulase positive staphylococci were present in 4% and Clostridium perfringens in 1.7% of all samples in low numbers. Of indicator organisms for fecal and sewage contamination, Escherichia coli were found in 3.2% and Streptococcus fecalis in 5.4% of the samples. The heat treatment applied during processing is not sufficient to destroy these organisms.

TI  - Environmental factors correlated with size of bacterial populations in a polluted stream.
AB  - Samples of water were taken from a polluted zone of the Gallinas River and analyzed as to numbers of total bacteria, coliforms, and fecal streptococci. Environmental factors measured were temperature, pH and concentrations of detergent, nitrate plus nitrite nitrogen, sulfate, chloride, bicarbonate, and phosphate. Thirty-two observations were made from 12 March through 22 July 1971. Stepwise multiple linear regression analyses of the data were carried out by computer to determine which of the environmental factors were significantly correlated with numbers of bacteria present. A multiple linear regression equation was constructed for each bacteriological parameter as a function of significant variables only. Log total bacteria was correlated positively with bicarbonate, phosphate, and detergent concentrations. Log coliforms was correlated positively with phosphate and sulfate concentrations and negatively with chloride concentration. Log fecal streptococci was correlated positively with bicarbonate and chloride concentrations.

TI  - Experimental Shigella infections in laboratory animals. I. Antagonism by human normal flora components in gnotobiotic mice.
AB  - Germfree mice were associated with selected species of human intestinal bacteria  and then challenged with a streptomycin-resistant Shigella flexneri strain. Antagonism against Shigella was most pronounced in mice associated with Escherichia coli and least pronounced in mice associated with Bacteroides fragilis. A moderate degree of antagonism could be demonstrated in mice associated with either Streptococcus faecalis or Bifidobacterium adolescentis. Shigella persisted in the cecal contents of E. coli-associated mice at very low, stable levels. Shigella populations were reduced to levels below detection in the ceca of mice diassociated with E. coli and Bacteroides. Upon subsequent administration of streptomycin, Bacteroides disappeared from the ceca. The E. coli population was greatly reduced, and Shigella reappeared at very high population levels as an apparent recombinant which resembled E. coli biochemically. A streptomycin-resistant E. coli population subsequently emerged and became dominant in the ceca. Shigella concomitantly declined to levels below detection.
TI  - Function of various intestinal bacteria in converting germfree mice to the normal state.
AB  - Earlier work had shown that a collection of anaerobic bacteria, in conjunction with facultative anaerobes, may be implanted into germfree mice, thereby rendering the animals "normal" with respect to a variety of parameters tested. The present experiments indicate that a different collection of anaerobic bacteria, isolated from the cecum of normal mice, was necessary to convert germfree mice to the "normal" state when the animals were fed a crude diet, rather than the refined food which had been used in the earlier work. The nature and level of short-chain fatty acids associated with various natural or synthetic "normal" floras in the ceca of mice did not always correlate with the Escherichia coli population present, indicating that fatty acids were not the sole agents inhibiting bacterial populations in the intestine. Experiments are reported which indicate that intestinal anaerobes may under certain circumstances be sufficient to control the populations of other intestinal bacteria such as E. coli. In other instances, such as control of Shigella populations in the mouse intestine, intestinal anaerobes appeared to act synergistically with an E. coli strain, in spite of the fact that the population of the latter was itself suppressed by the anaerobes.
TI  - Quantitative sputum culture as a means of excluding false positive reports in the routine microbiology laboratory.
AB  - A relatively simple technique for sputum homogenization and dilution is described. Results show that this technique is reliable for isolation and quantitative culture of organisms from cases of chest infection. The technique has resulted in significant reduction in false positive reports, particularly when a system of interpretative reporting is utilized based on 10(7) organisms per millilitre of sputum being accepted as evidence of significant infection.

TI  - Amoxycillin: a new semi-synthetic penicillin.
AB  - Amoxycillin (alpha-amino-p-hydroxybenzylpenicillin) is a new semi-synthetic penicillin with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity similar to that of ampicillin. Penicillin-sensitive strains of staphylococci, streptococci, and pneumococci were sensitive to concentrations of 0.1 mug or less of amoxycillin/ml. Strains of Haemophilus influenzae were inhibited by a level of 0.5 mug/ml, and most strains of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Shigella sonnei, Salmonella species, and Streptococcus faecalis were sensitive to a concentration of 5 mug or less of amoxycillin/ml. Penicillinase-producing strains of Staphylococcus aureus and strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, indole-positive Proteus, Klebsiella, and Enterobacter were insensitive to amoxycillin. The new penicillin was bactericidal in activity, as with other penicillins, and its antibacterial activity was not reduced in the presence of serum. After oral administration to volunteer subjects amoxycillin produced serum concentrations twice as high as those obtained with similar doses of ampicillin, and the penicillin was recovered unchanged in high concentrations in the urine. The absorption of amoxycillin was not greatly influenced by food, and administration of probenecid resulted in increased and more prolonged concentrations of amoxycillin in serum.
TI  - Phagocytosis of microbial L-forms.
AB  - Little data are available regarding L-form phagocyte interactions. Due to difficulty with more conventional methods, a serum-free technique of surface phagocytosis employing cellulose ester micropore filters, fluorochrome staining, and reflecting fluorescence microscopy was developed. Intracellular localization of L-frms was confirmed by electron microscopy. In timed experiments, phagocytosis of a group D Streptococcus (ATCC 23241) and its L-form (T53I) were maximal at 30 min, although the bacteria were consistently better phagocyted. Phagocytosis of an Escherichia coli (strain Yale) and its L-form was also demonstrated with the same technique. The lesser phagocytosis of L-forms may be related to their lower chemotactic activity.

Of these, 177 (86.3%) were resistant to more than 6 mug/ml and 140 of 141 (99.3%) strains of Escherichia coli were resistant to more than 3 mug/ml. Urine levels of nifuratel were examined in two groups: one group had 400 mg given once and the other group had 2 g given over 24 hours. In both groups samples of urine were collected every hour for seven hours after the last dose. After one 400-mg dose the maximum urine level achieved by any subject was 2.0 mug/ml and the mean maximum level was 0.75 mug/ml. With the 2 g total dose, the maximum level noted was 4 mug/ml and the mean maximum level was 1.8 mug/ml. No measurable inhibition was noted in any of the blood samples removed at one and a half to two hours after the last dose.

TI  - Complete deficiency of leukocyte glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase with defective bactericidal activity.
AB  - A 52 yr old Caucasian female (F. E.) had hemolytic anemia, a leukemoid reaction,  and fatal sepsis due to Escherichia coli. Her leukocytes ingested bacteria normally but did not kill catalase positive Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Serratia marcescens. An H(2)O(2)-producing bacterium, Streptococcus faecalis, was killed normally. Granule myeloperoxidase, acid and alkaline phosphatase, and beta glucuronidase activities were normal, and these enzymes shifted normally to the phagocyte vacuole (light and electron microscopy). Intravacuolar reduction of nitroblue tetrazolium did not occur. Moreover, only minimal quantities of H(2)O(2) were generated, and the hexose monophosphate shunt (HMPS) was not stimulated during phagocytosis. These observations suggested the diagnosis of chronic granulomatous disease. However, in contrast to control and chronic granulomatous disease leukocytes, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity was completely absent in F. E. leukocytes whereas NADH oxidase and NADPH oxidase activities were both normal. Unlike chronic granulomatous disease, methylene blue did not stimulate the hexose monophosphate shunt in F. E. cells. Thus, F. E. and chronic granulomatous disease leukocytes appear to share certain metabolic and bactericidal defects, but the metabolic basis of the abnormality differs. Chronic granulomatous disease cells lack oxidase activity which produces H(2)O(2); F. E. cells had normal levels of oxidase activity but failed to produce NADPH due to complete glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency. These data indicate that a complete absence of leukocyte glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase with defective hexose monophosphate shunt activity is associated with low H(2)O(2) production and inadequate bactericidal activity, and further suggest an important role for NADPH in the production of H(2)O(2) in human granulocytes.

AB  - Overnight cultures of V. cholerae, V. el tor, non-cholera vibrio, and Streptococcus pneumoniae in tryptone-soya broth (with 5% blood added for the last-named) failed to grow on subculture despite visible growth in all tubes. Viable counts and pH determinations of overnight cultures of various species in tryptone-soya broth, brain-heart infusion broth, and Lab-Lemco peptone broth show that death in tryptone-soya broth is associated with the drop in pH resulting from fermentation of glucose in the medium and that this drop is greater than that produced by the same amount of glucose in brain-heart infusion broth. Some strains of pneumococci failed to grow in brain-heart infusion broth and it is suggested that both these media are unsuitable for blood cultures.

AB  - Candida albicans, administered by gastric intubation, persisted in the gastrointestinal tract of gnotobiotic mice for long periods but was eliminated within a relatively short period of time in pathogen-free mice. Oxytetracycline administered by mouth had no reproducible effect on the persistence of C. albicans in the gastrointestinal tract of either germ-free or pathogen-free mice. Prolonged administration of streptomycin extended the time that C. albicans could be recovered from feces of pathogen-free mice when compared to mice not receiving the antibiotic or those receiving a single large dose. There was a brief interval of time during which C. albicans could not be recovered from the feces of gnotobiotic mice contaminated with certain intestinal bacteria, but eventually all mice began to shed the fungus again. C. albicans administered by mouth was not pathogenic for germ-free or pathogen-free mice. It can be concluded from these findings that mice do not possess an innate resistance to C. albicans but that pathogen-free mice do possess some ecological mechanism which prevents establishment of the fungus in their gastrointestinal tract. The reason for the difference in colonization of C. albicans in germ-free or gnotobiotic mice and pathogen-free mice was not determined.

AB  - Several common strains of bacteria have been studied to determine their influence on human and rabbit platelets in vitro. Bacteria at a nominal ratio of 1:1 were added to platelets in their native plasma or to platelets in a balanced salt solution. The platelet-bacterial interaction was examined by nephelometry and by sequential light microscopy of fixed specimens taken at key points in the reaction. The results support the following conclusions: (1) Bacteria that were potent stimuli of the platelet aggregation reaction were incorporated in large numbers into the forming platelet aggregates. (2) Bacteria sequestered within platelet aggregates remained in direct contact with the aggregated platelet mass for up to 1 hour in vitro and during this time showed no morphologic changes by light microscopy. (3) Plateletbacterial interaction produced clumping of the bacteria but no demonstrable killing of the microorganisms. (4) Collagen-platelet interaction resulted in release of platelet products that were capable of clumping bacteria but were not lethal to them. (5) Rabbit and human platelets showed no species differences in plateletbacterial interaction. (6) Washed platelets interacted with bacteria without added serum factors but the addition of serum accelerated the aggregation reaction.

Results of this investigation have established the following parameters of platelet-bacterial interaction: (1) Bacteria are potent stimuli of the platelet-aggregating reaction. (2) The platelet-bacterial interaction proceeds through four distinct phases which are separable by varying the platelet-bacterial ratios or adding appropriate chemical inhibitors. (3) The degree and rate of the platelet response is proportional to the ratio of bacteria to platelets. (4) Direct contact between platelets and bacteria, physiologic levels of divalent cations and nucleotide release from platelets are essential for aggregation of platelets by bacteria. (5) By adding equivalent numbers of six species of microorganisms to platelet-rich plasma, their potency as initiators of the platelet reaction was determined, with Staphylococcus being the most powerful.

The bacterial species in the pars preventricularis were identified as Flavobacterium peregrinum, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus faecalis, and Lactobacillus acidophilus, listed in order of decreasing deamidase activity. Nicotinamide-7-(14)C ingested into rat stomach was rapidly deamidated to nicotinic acid. These results contribute to the accumulated evidence that microorganisms present in the pars preventricularis of rat stomach are responsible for the deamidation of nicotinamide to nicotinic acid, a known precursor of mammalian pyridine nucleotides.

AB  - Bacteriocin activity of Streptococcus faecalis var. zymogenes was tested against  a variety of bacteria, L-forms, and mycoplasmas. Both a partially purified liquid preparation and a colony overlay technique were used. Other S. faecalis strains were the only bacteria whose growth was inhibited. The liquid preparation inhibited growth of all but three of the tested L-forms (whether derived from gram-positive or gram-negative bacteria), and two of these exceptional organisms were inhibited when the colony overlay technique was employed. On the other hand, the L-form of Streptobacillus moniliformis and all 33 tested mycoplasmas grew readily in the presence of the bacteriocin when either method was employed. It is suggested that the presence of cholesterol in the Streptobacillus and mycoplasmal membranes, unique in this regard among procaryotic cells, may be responsible for the differential pattern of growth inhibition.

TI  - Colonization resistance of the digestive tract in conventional and antibiotic-treated mice.
AB  - The effect of oral administration of antibiotics on the intestinal flora of conventional mice and their resistance to colonization by orally introduced Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was studied. Colonization resistance (CR) was expressed as the log of the oral bacterial dose followed by a persistent take in 50% of the contaminated animals. The intestinal flora was virtually eliminated by the antibiotics and this elimination was accompanied by a precipitous fall of CR. CR gradually returned to normal values during the period of repopulation of the intestinal tract by the organisms surviving the treatment. Antibiotic treatment resulted in the disappearance of Enterobacteriaceae, enterococci, staphylococci and yeasts and, under appropriate housing conditions, the animals remained free of these organisms indefinitely. Germ-free mice contaminated with the intestinal flora of an antibiotic-treated animal and their offspring housed in a germ-free isolator showed high values of CR. Their intestinal flora consisted of anaerobic bacteria only. Apparently, these anaerobes are responsible for CR in these and in conventional mice.

TI  - An enzyme-based theory of obligate anaerobiosis: the physiological function of superoxide dismutase.
AB  - The distribution of catalase and superoxide dismutase has been examined in various micro-organisms. Strict anaerobes exhibited no superoxide dismutase and, generally, no catalase activity. All aerobic organisms containing cytochrome systems were found to contain both superoxide dismutase and catalase. Aerotolerant anaerobes, which survive exposure to air and metabolize oxygen to a limited extent but do not contain cytochrome systems, were found to be devoid of catalase activity but did exhibit superoxide dismutase activity. This distribution is consistent with the proposal that the prime physiological function of superoxide dismutase is protection of oxygen-metabolizing organisms against the potentially detrimental effects of the superoxide free radical, a biologically produced intermediate resulting from the univalent reduction of molecular oxygen.
TI  - Vitamin B12 uptake by intestinal microorganisms: mechanism and relevance to syndromes of intestinal bacterial overgrowth.
AB  - The mechanism of bacterial uptake of vitamin B(12), the spectrum of microorganisms capable of such uptake, and the factors involved were the subject of this study. Bacterial uptake of vitamin B(12) was found to be at least a two stage process. A primary uptake phase which was rapid (1 min or less), pH dependent, nontemperature dependent, did not require viable organisms and was insensitive to either the metabolic inhibitor dinitrophenol or to the sulfhydryl inhibitor N-ethyl-maleimide. Protein denaturation (formalin treatment or autoclaving) abolished all B(12) uptake. This primary uptake phase is thought to represent adsorption to binding or "receptor" sites on the cell wall. Second stage uptake was slower, pH and temperature dependent, required living bacteria, and was abolished by either dinitrophenol or N-ethyl-maleimide. This phase is dependent upon metabolic processes and may reflect transfer of B(12) from surface "receptor" sites into the bacterial cell. Although differences among organisms were observed in total 1 hr uptake, number of surface "receptor" sites, and relative avidities for B(12), all organisms except Streptococcus fecalis shared the two stage mechanism. Two Gram-positive organisms. Bacillus subtilis and Group A streptococcus, demonstrated the highest 1 hr vitamin B(12) uptake values; Gram-negative bacteria required 2,000-10,000 the number of organisms for comparable uptake. Binding constants (K(m)) varied from 5.05 +/-1.67 x 10(-10)M for B. subtilis to 6.18 +/-3.08 x 10(-9)M for Klebsiella pneumoniae which approximate the Km for human intrinsic factor (0.38 x 10(-10)M). Competition between bacteria and intrinsic factor for vitamin B(12) may be inferred from the similarity of these constants. These observations suggest that a variety of enteric and nonenteric organisms, not requiring exogenous B(12), may play a role in the pathogenesis of the vitamin B(12) malabsorption found in the intestinal bacterial overgrowth syndromes.

AB  - Injury of test cultures was quantitated by differences in colony counts obtained  with a complete medium and those obtained on conventional selective media. Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, and several strains of Escherichia coli were injured when exposed to the quaternary ammonium compound methylalkyltrimethyl ammonium chloride. Representative hypochlorite sanitizers also caused injury of E. coli ML30. Sanitizer concentration appeared to be the main factor in the cause of death and injury, a higher concentration being needed to cause death. Increases in temperature did not result in substantial increases in injury; however, the lethal effect was greater at higher temperatures. Varying the cell concentration from 10(7) to 10(9) cells per ml did not change the fraction of cell population killed or injured. The inability or failure of common selective media to detect injured bacteria in food could have serious public health consequences.

AB  - 1. New halogenated 1,4-naphthoquinones were synthesized and together with other known 1,4-naphthoquinones, were screened for antibacterial activity by a turbidimetric method, and for antifungal activity by the diffusion method on agar plates.2. The half-wave potentials and the influence on the oxidative phosphorylation of some of these compounds were determined.3. 2-chloro-3,2'-chloro-ethyl-1,4-naphthoquinone (half-wave potential=-187 mV) was the most active compound, completely inhibiting cell respiration.4. While the natural active naphthoquinones, vitamin K and ubiquinones, possess, as substituent, the electron repelling methyl group, the microbiologically active 1,4-naphthoquinones are substituted, in the quinone moiety, with electron attracting groups such as OH or Cl.5. The half-wave potentials can give only an initial indication of the activity of the compounds studied; a good correlation, on the contrary, can be found between the ultraviolet spectra of such compounds and their activity which seems to depend on the ability of active compounds to exist in an extensively conjugated structure and to form hydrogen bonds.

It was found that these plates can be stored for 3 weeks at 4 C without an appreciable affect on zone sizes. Storage of plates in sealed plastic bags did not alter the results significantly. The findings indicate that commercially prepared Mueller-Hinton agar plates, which may be several days old when received at the laboratory, are suitable for use in routine susceptibility tests by the Bauer-Kirby method.

These areas represent distinct "polysome" peaks rather than random distribution of polymers of varied length. They appear to be membrane subunits. In addition there is a further particle with a density of about 150S, incapable of protein synthesis but which is capable of stimulating protein synthesis in some of the larger fractions found by gradient centrifugation.
TI  - Requirement for coenzyme A in the phosphoroclastic reaction of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - Various bacteria which degrade pyruvate by the phosphoroclastic reaction were examined with respect to the role of coenzyme A (CoA) in this reaction. The strictly anaerobic bacteria, which cleave pyruvate by the phosphoroclastic reaction characteristic of Clostridia, required catalytic levels of CoA for the CO(2)-pyruvate exchange and acetoin-forming portions of the phosphoroclastic reaction. These reactions were reversibly inhibited by the CoA analogue, desulfo-CoA. In contrast, using cell-free extracts of bacteria which degrade pyruvate by the coliform phosphoroclastic reaction (pyruvate formate-lyase), no requirement for CoA could be observed for the formate-pyruvate exchange reaction. It is suggested that CoA serves a regulatory function in the early portion of the clostridal type of phosphoroclastic reaction.

TI  - Membrane adenosine triphosphatase of Escherichia coli: activation by calcium ion  and inhibition by monovalent cations.
AB  - Membrane ghost preparations of Escherichia coli K-12 obtained by osmotic lysis of lysozyme-induced spheroplasts were found to possess both Mg(++)- and Ca(++)-activated adenosine 5'-triphosphatase (ATPase, EC 3.6.1.3) activities. Maximal activities of 1.0 to 1.5 mumoles of orthophosphate released per min per mg of protein were obtained at pH 9.0 with a molar Mg(++) to adenosine 5'triphosphate (ATP) ratio of 2:5 and at pH 9.9 with a molar Ca(++) to ATP ratio of 1:5. These ATPase activities were not altered by ouabain, fluoride, N-ethylmaleimide, 2,4-dinitrophenol, cyanide, or dithionite, but were inhibited by low concentrations of azide, p-chloromercuribenzoate, and pentachlorophenol. Mg(++) ATPase was more susceptible to inhibition by azide than was Ca(++) ATPase. Fifty per cent inactivation of both activities was observed when membrane ghost preparations were preincubated at 66 C for 10 min. The Mg(++) and Ca(++) ATPase activities of these preparations were not additive, but did respond independently to inhibition by monovalent cations. Ca(++) ATPase was found to be very sensitive to inhibition by K(+), Na(+), Li(+), Rb(+), and Cs(+); Mg(++) ATPase was relatively insensitive to these ions. One possible interpretation of the results presented in this paper is that the membrane of E. coli possesses an ATPase which is activated by either Mg(++) or Ca(++) and that activation by Ca(++) increases the susceptibility of this enzyme to inhibition by monovalent cations. Increased susceptibility of E. coli membrane ATPase to inhibition by monovalent cations such as Na(+) and K(+) as a consequence of Ca(++) activation could represent a regulatory mechanism.

Bacterial colonization of the jejunum defined, in this context, as the occurrence of a bile salttolerant flora consisting of both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria qualitatively resembling that of faeces, was observed only in patients with some form of blind loop. Prominent among the bacteria isolated from these colonized juices were non-sporing anaerobic bacteria, most usually Bacteroides, able to hydrolyse bile salts. No simple correlation between the patient's fat excretion and bacterial colonization of the jejunum could be demonstrated.

TI  - Antipseudomonal activity of alpha-sulfoaminopenicillins.
AB  - A series of penicillins characterized by the presence of a sulfoamino or a modified sulfoamino group in the side chain was subjected to in vitro antimicrobial screening tests. Although the most potent members of the series were less active than benzylpenicillin against gram-positive bacteria and comparably active against most gram-negative bacteria, they were, on the average, 8 to 16 times more effective against strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In other comparative laboratory tests against P. aeruginosa, these compounds were about as active as carbenicillin and four to eight times more active than ampicillin. An examination of structure-activity relationships indicated that maximal potency was obtained with penicillins having an alpha-(aromatic or heteroaromatic)-alpha-sulfoaminoacetamido side chain. The compound with an alpha-phenyl group was comparable in activity to those having an alpha-(2- or 3-thienyl) group, whereas any modification in position or structure of the alpha-sulfoamino group reduced activity. Results of studies with a cell-free P. aeruginosa beta-lactamase suggest that the marked inhibitory effects of alpha-sulfoamino penicillins for P. aeruginosa can be attributed, at least in part, to their high degree of resistance to this enzyme. Some derivatives, however, had weak antipseudomonal activity, despite possessing a high degree of beta-lactamase resistance.

TI  - Bacteriocin (hemolysin) of Streptococcus zymogenes.
AB  - The sensitivity of Streptococcus faecalis (ATTC 8043) to S. zymogenes X-14 bacteriocin depends greatly on its physiological age. Sensitivity decreases from the mid-log phase on and is completely lost in the stationary phase. The sensitivity of erythrocytes to the hemolytic capacity of the bacteriocin showed considerable species variation. The order of increasing sensitivity was goose < sheep < dog < horse < human < rabbit. However, when red cell stromata were used as inhibitors of hemolysis in a standard system employing rabbit erythrocytes the order of increasing effectiveness was sheep < rabbit < human < horse < goose. When rabbit cells were used in varying concentrations with a constant hemolysin concentration, there was a lag of about 30 min, which for a given hemolysin preparation was constant for all red cell concentrations. Furthermore, the rate of hemolysis increased with increasing red cell concentration. If red cells are held constant and lysin varied, the time to reach half-maximal lysis varies directly with lysin but is not strictly proportional. Bacterial membranes were one to three orders of magnitude more effective than red cell stromata as inhibitors. The order of increasing effectiveness seems to be Escherichia coli < Bacillus megaterium < S. faecalis < Micrococcus lysodeikticus. In addition to membranes, a d-alanine containing glycerol teichoic acid, trypsin in high concentration, and deoxyribonuclease also inhibited hemolysis. Ribonuclease, d-alanine, l-alanine, dl-alanyl-dl-alanine, N-acetyl-d-alanine, N-acetyl-l-alanine did not inhibit hemolysis.

AB  - A long, thin, approximately cylindrical core spans the interior of cells of 24-hr cultures of all group D streptococci that were examined, five strains of Streptococcus faecalis, single strains of S. faecalis subsp. zymogenes and S. durans, and three strains of Streptococcus spp. In one strain of S. faecalis, serial section electron microscopy showed that most cells possess a core. The core is 0.10 to 0.16 mum thick and consists of a matrix and an axial array of ribosomelike particles. It resembles one of two types of cores present in a stable protoplast form of one of the S. faecalis strains. Cores were not present in single strains of S. pyogenes (beta-hemolytic group A), S. agalactiae (group B), S. dysgalactiae (group C), S. equisimilis (group C), and S. mitis (viridans group) that were examined; nor were cores observed in single strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Bacillus megaterium. Cores may be useful, therefore, in identification of group D streptococci. For preservation and rapid recognition of cores, a glutaraldehyde-osmium tetroxide sequence of fixation appears superior to the osmium tetroxide method often employed in processing bacteria for electron microscopy.

TI  - Enhancing effect on alkalinization of the medium on the activity of erythromycin  against gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of erythromycin was markedly enhanced by alkalinization of the culture medium or urine within the clinical range (pH 6.0 to 8.2). This effect was demonstrated against recent isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter sp., and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis. The urine of normal volunteers was made alkaline by ingestion of sodium bicarbonate or acetazolamide (Diamox) during administration of 1.0 g of erythromycin every 8 hr; such urine was capable of inhibiting E. coli and K. pneumoniae even when diluted up to (in one instance) 128 times with broth of the same pH as the urine. Undiluted urine of the same subjects, without alkalinization, was seldom capable of inhibiting these organisms. The range of pH (6.6 to 8.6) over which the antibacterial effect was enhanced coincided with that over which there was decreasing ionization of a basic group.
TI  - Lytic effects of staphylococcal alpha-toxin and delta-hemolysin.
AB  - Several preparations of staphylococcal alpha-toxin and delta-lysin were studied in order to compare hemolytic activity with capacity to lyse bacterial protoplasts. delta-Lysin in relatively low concentration lysed protoplasts of Sarcina lutea, protoplasts of Streptococcus faecalis, and spheroplasts of Escherichia coli. Lysis of bacterial protoplasts by preparations of alpha-toxin appeared to be due to contamination of the preparations with delta-lysin. Data comparing the protoplast-lysing activity of various lytic agents are presented.

AB  - In an effort to determine the adequacy of a standard broth medium in the evaluation of antibiotic combinations, 20 strains of various bacterial species were studied simultaneously in Mueller-Hinton broth and in freshly drawn human serum from apparently healthy volunteers. Studies of growth dynamics by use of the usual plate dilution technique for quantitating colony-forming units were performed with strains of Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-resistant and methicillin-susceptible), Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Aerobacter, Klebsiella, and Proteus mirabilis. A variety of different antibiotics were investigated. With 19 of the 20 strains, interpretations of synergism or antagonism were the same in both media. Therefore, despite minor variations when the same strain was studied in both serum and broth, it is concluded that Mueller-Hinton broth is an adequate medium for use in studies of chemotherapeutic combinations in vitro. A simplified method for studying bactericidal activity is described, which is deemed practical for clinical microbiology laboratories and which led to the same conclusions regarding the combinations as were obtained by the more arduous plate dilution test.

AB  - A gas chromatograph fitted with electron capture and flame ionization detectors was employed for the rapid detection of bacteria by analysis for their metabolic products. The presence of Proteus vulgaris, Streptococcus faecalis, S. liquefaciens, Escherichia coli B, Bacillus cereus, and B. popilliae was detected in 2 to 4 hr in media inoculated with less than 10(4) cells per ml, whereas a 7- to 12-hr growth period was required for the detection of products formed in cultures of Serratia marcescens, Aerobacter aerogenes, E. coli K-12, Staphylococcus aureus, and Salmonella typhimurium. Metabolites elaborated by the equivalent of less than a single cell of B. cereus, S. faecalis, P. vulgaris, or E. coli B were sensed by the electron capture detector. The flame ionization detector was generally not as sensitive. Volatile metabolites were identified, and their concentrations were determined.

TI  - Effect of hydroxylysine on the biosynthesis of lysine in Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - We were able to show that two lysine-independent mutants of Streptococcus faecalis ATCC 8043 contained the enzymes for the usual bacterial pathway for lysine biosynthesis. Because of this synthetic capacity, one mutant, the Lys(+)OHLys(s) strain, could not grow in the presence of hydroxylysine without a lysine supplement. Both lysine and hydroxylysine inhibited the first enzyme of the pathway, aspartokinase. Unlike the Escherichia coli enzyme, S. faecalis dihydrodipicolinic acid synthetase was not inhibited by either lysine or hydroxylysine. Both amino acids caused the repression of dihydrodipicolinic acid synthetase and diaminopimelic acid decarboxylase. Failure of Lys(+)OHLys(s) strain to grow in hydroxylysine-supplemented medium was caused by the mimicking of lysine control by hydroxylysine. Because hydroxylysine could not completely substitute for lysine and lysine could not be synthesized, the organism did not grow. We tested three lysine analogues and found that they prevented lysine-depletion lysis in the Lsy(-)OHLys(s) strain, as did hydroxylysine. Each analogue seemed to support cell wall mucopeptide synthesis, although ornithine did not. Preliminary data indicated that these analogues like hydroxylysine, have growth-inhibitory action on the Lys(+)OHLys(s) strain, but not the Lys(+)OHLys(r) strain. The nature of the specificity of the lysine-adding enzyme for cell wall mucopeptide synthesis is discussed.

TI  - Effect of algicidal quaternaries on the germicidal activity of chlorine on swimming pool water.
AB  - The Swimming Pool Water Disinfectant Test Method of the Association of Official Analytical Chemists was used to determine the effect of the accepted level of 2 ppm of some commercial quaternary ammonium algicides on the germicidal activity of chlorine. Accurate determinations on the amounts of residual available chlorine in chlorine-quaternary mixtures could not be made by the usual chemical methods. This made it necessary to base all comparisons on the starting concentrations of available chlorine rather than the final concentration as specified in the method employed. No evidence was obtained to support the use of lower concentrations of residual available chlorine for disinfection in the presence of algicidal quaternaries than those commonly recognized as effective by the American Public Health Association. The rate of kill against the gram-positive test organism Streptococcus faecalis was faster in quaternary-chlorine mixtures than in the sodium hypochlorite control solutions. The practical significance of this result in the bench method identified cannot be ascertained in the absence of more sensitive and precise chemical procedures for determining concentrations of residual available chlorine in the presence of quaternaries or in actual swimming pool tests.
TI  - Role of the phagocyte in host-parasite interactions. XII. Hydrogen peroxide-myeloperoxidase bactericidal system in the phagocyte.
AB  - An antimicrobial system in polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) consisting of myeloperoxidase and hydrogen peroxide has been proposed. This system appears to be activated during phagocytosis as a result of the stimulated metabolic activities. A lysed-granules (LG) fraction was prepared from guinea pig exudative PMN. LG alone possessed bactericidal activity which was related to the pH of the reaction; the lower the pH, the more marked the activity. When low concentrations of both H(2)O(2) and LG were combined under conditions where neither factor alone exhibited significant killing power, there was a striking increase in bactericidal activity. This enhanced activity was much greater than an additive effect. The LG-peroxide antibacterial system was most active over a pH range of 4.0 to 6.0. The activity of the LG-peroxide system was essentially abolished by peroxidase inhibitors, NaN(3), KCN, and aminotriazole. The antibacterial activity of this system was nonspecific in nature, being equally effective against gram-negative and gram-positive organisms.
TI  - In vivo and in vitro action of norethindrone on staphylococci.
AB  - Norethindrone has been examined in vitro for antibacterial activity against 10 microorganisms. Turbidimetric techniques were used to assay the antibacterial activity of norethindrone. The organisms tested included Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Micrococcus conglomeratus, Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus faecalis, Salmonella typhosa, Shigella flexnerii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Proteus vulgaris. Bacteriostatic action was shown only against the gram-positive microorganisms when they were grown anaerobically in Tryptic Soy Broth containing 10 to 50 mug of norethindrone per ml. The bacteriostatic action of norethindrone was exerted primarily during the first 8 hr of incubation and it was reduced by the presence of oxygen. Mestranol at a concentration of 1 to 10 mug/ml failed to exert any significant action on S. aureus. However, incorporation of 5 mug of mestranol per ml in the culture medium enhanced the bacteriostatic action of norethindrone on staphylococci. Enhancement of the bacteriostatic action of norethindrone could not be obtained by the addition of a concentration of 5 mug/ml of testosterone, 17alpha-estradiol, and 17beta-estradiol. Progesterone and 4-pregnen-20beta-ol-3-one under similar conditions showed an additive bacteriostatic effect when they were incorporated into the culture medium containing norethindrone. In vivo studies indicated that female, adult New Zealand rabbits, injected subcutaneously with two injections of 10 to 20 mug of norethindrone, 24 hr apart, and challenged intradermally with S. aureus 4 hr after the second injection, had fewer lesions with smaller areas of swelling and erythema as compared to control, nontreated rabbits. The protective effect of norethindrone on the development of staphylococcal lesion seemed related to hormone concentration. Thus, it was demonstrated with doses of 20, 15, and 10 mug, but not with doses of 1 and 5 mug. When the lesions were excised 48 to 92 hr after infection and when viable cell counts were made, rabbits treated with norethindrone showed significantly lower staphylococcal counts than the control rabbits. During the 1st day after infection with S. aureus, leukocytic counts of the norethindrone-treated rabbits remained normal, whereas control animals showed elevated leukocytic counts.

This treatment was effective in destroying Escherichia coli, Streptococcus faecalis, vegetative cells and spores of Bacillus subtilis, and bacteriophage specific for S. cremoris ML1. The presence of added protein in bacterial suspensions resulted in reduced bactericidal action. Water subjected to electrohydraulic treatment retained a certain amount of toxicity when copper-core electrodes were used to apply the treatment. This was caused by copper liberated from the electrode during electrohydraulic discharge.

Growth  and virulence of Candida albicans after oral inoculation in the chick with a monoflora of either Escherichia coli or Streptococcus faecalis. J. Bacteriol. 91:1744-1749. 1966.-Bacterial protection against intestinal infection by Candida albicans was investigated in chicks with a monoflora of either Escherichia coli or Streptococcus faecalis. These animals were obtained by orally inoculating germ-free chicks (3 days old) with pure cultures of bacteria. Each bacterial species was established in large numbers in the gut of separate groups of animals within 24 hr of inoculation; these numbers were similar in chicks examined 34 days later, at which time all animals were killed. The numbers of bacteria from contents of the crop, small intestine, and ceca were similar in chicks with the E. coli monoflora. Comparable results were obtained in chicks with the S. faecalis monoflora, except for decreased numbers in the duodenum and jejunum. Some of the monoflora chicks (7 days old) were transferred into separate isolators, orally inoculated with C. albicans, and observed for 34 days. All chicks grew well and appeared healthy. However, examinations at autopsy revealed severe crop infections in chicks with a diflora containing S. faecalis. Preferential growth of hyphae (C. albicans) occurred in the lesions and throughout the gut. The numbers of S. faecalis in the gut were comparable to those found in unchallenged animals. Agglutinins against C. albicans were not detected in our test or control chicks. Chicks with a diflora containing E. coli and C. albicans had a few microscopic crop lesions containing small numbers of hyphae. C. albicans was well established in the gut of these animals, largely as the yeast form. The numbers of E. coli in the gut were similar to those in control chicks. Thus, it was concluded that E. coli provided protection against crop infection by C. albicans. In crop contents from unchallenged animals, chicks with S. faecalis monoflora were about pH 5, whereas birds with E. coli monoflora were about pH 7. The challenge did not greatly change the former value, and the latter was slightly decreased. In the crop of unchallenged birds, negative E(h) values were found in chicks with S. faecalis and positive E(h) values in those with E. coli. Challenge did not greatly change these values. These data on pH and E(h) were related to conditions for morphogenesis of C. albicans and virulence. No major difference in the concentrations of serum proteins was seen in chicks with E. coli or S. faecalis after challenge with C. albicans. Possible mechanisms of the protective effect of E. coli are discussed.

AB  - Studies on the germicidal activity of chlorine, bromine, and iodine were made by  use of the Association of Official Agricultural Chemists official first action method for determining effectiveness of swimming pool water disinfectants. In this procedure, 0.3 ppm of available chlorine as chlorine gas has activity equivalent to 0.6 ppm of available chlorine in the buffered sodium hypochlorite control when Escherichia coli is used as the test organism. With Streptococcus faecalis as the test organism, 0.45 ppm of available chlorine as gaseous chlorine gives activity equivalent to the control. Liquid bromine at 1.0 ppm is as effective as the 0.6 ppm of available chlorine hypochlorite control with E. coli as the test organism, but 2.0 ppm of liquid bromine is necessary to provide activity equivalent to the 0.6 ppm of available chlorine control when S. faecalis is employed. With iodine as metallic iodine, 2.0 ppm is necessary to provide a result equivalent to the 0.6 ppm of available chlorine control with both E. coli and S. faecalis. In the various systems tested, gaseous chlorine was the most active form of available chlorine; liquid bromine provided the most active form of bromine, and metallic iodine provided the most active form of iodine.

A tentative scheme for the biohydrogenation route to stearic acid is presented. The main pathway is through diconjugated cis-cis-cis-octadecatrienoic acid, non-conjugated trans-cis (cis-trans)-octadecadienoic acid and trans-octadecenoic acid, but other pathways are apparent. 3. Washed rumen micro-organisms possessed only a limited capacity to hydrogenate alpha-linolenic acid and oleic acid but the rate was greatly stimulated by a factor(s) present in the supernatant rumen liquor. 4. Pure cultures of Clostridium perfringens, Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli and a coliform organism isolated from sheep faeces possessed negligible ability to hydrogenate unsaturated fatty acids compared with a mixed population of rumen micro-organisms. Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens slowly converted linoleic acid into octadecenoic acid.

TI  - Radiation survival of food pathogens in complex media.
AB  - When 15 bacterial species representing genera associated with food-borne diseases were irradiated individually, all except Escherichia coli and Streptococcus faecalis showed typical linear dose-survival curves in Hartsell's broth. The minimal lethal dose (MLD) for the organisms tested ranged from 3.0 x 10(5) to 6.0 x 10(5) rad. Salmonella paratyphi B, S. wichita, S. typhi, E. coli, and S. faecalis were found to be the least sensitive to radiation. In commercially canned crabmeat the survival curves of S. typhi, S. paratyphi B, and S. wichita exhibited to varying degrees an initial linear death decline with increasing radiation doses, followed by a distinct tailing effect caused by survival of low numbers at the higher doses. The above species of Salmonella were further individually subjected to gamma-radiation in various dilutions of crabmeat. The "tailing effect" gradually disappeared, with the dose-survival curve tending to become linear as the concentration of the crabmeat decreased.

Data are presented which indicate that (i) the compounds must be present during the irradiation period for maximal sensitization to be observed, (ii) the sensitizing effect can be nullified by cysteine or cysteamine, (iii) the sensitizing effect occurs in a number of diverse bacterial genera, and (iv) folic acid neither sensitizes bacteria to irradiation nor prevents the sensitization caused by these antifolic agents.

Bacteriol. 90:347-351. 1965.-Certain strains of lactobacilli and pediococci incorporated hematin during growth, with the concomitant formation of cyanide- and azide-sensitive catalase. Three of five strains of lactobacilli and five of 25 strains of pediococci were capable of this biosynthesis. The pediococci required the heme component of blood, whereas the lactobacilli could incorporate the heme component in the form of purified and solubilized hemin or from blood. In all cases where inhibitor-sensitive enzyme was produced, it was accompanied by the production of inhibitor-insensitive enzyme. In the absence of hematin, only insensitive enzyme was obtained. Two catalase-positive strains of Streptococcus faecalis were found incapable of the synthesis of a heme-type enzyme, as was one member of the genus Leuconostoc. Iron and manganese in the growth medium stimulated the production of the insensitive catalase, but significant quantities of these metals could not be found in a purified enzyme preparation obtained from Lactobacillus plantarum. Aeration had little or no effect on growth, but it consistently doubled the amount of cyanide- and azide-resistant catalase. By means of conventional enzyme fractionation techniques, it was possible to separate the two different enzymes present in the cell-free extract of a strain of Pediococcus homari which had been grown in the presence of blood.

AB  - A new antibiotic was isolated from fermentations of Streptomyces erythreus designed for erythromycin A production. Isolation of this compound was accomplished by use of ion-exchange chromatography and countercurrent distribution. It crystallized from methyl isobutyl ketone in colorless acicular plates which melted at 127 to 130 C. The empirical formula was C(42)H(75)NO(14) with a molecular weight of 820. Electrometric titration in 66% dimethylformamide showed an apparent pKa of 8.4. Nuclear magnetic resonance, infrared, and ultraviolet absorption indicated a close resemblance of the compound to known erythromycins, although its chromatographic behavior and solubility differed from those of the known erythromycins. Its antimicrobial spectrum was similar to erythromycin A, but the minimal inhibitory concentrations were much higher.

AB  - Bayliss, Berenice G. (Washington State University, Pullman), and Elizabeth R. Hall. Plasma coagulation by organisms other than Staphylococcus aureus. J. Bacteriol. 89:101-105. 1965.-Approximately 200 organisms were investigated for their ability to clot human and rabbit plasma. Various anticoagulants were used in preparing the plasma: acid-citrate-dextrose, ethylenediaminetetraacetate, balanced oxalate, potassium and sodium oxalates, and heparin. Twelve organisms were found which coagulated citrated plasma in less than 8 hr: four strains of Streptococcus faecalis; two strains of S. faecalis var. zymogenes; three strains of S. faecalis var. liquefaciens; and one strain each of S. pyogenes, Escherichia coli, and Serratia marcescens. Six strains of coagulase-positive Staphylococcus were selected for use as controls. Experiments were performed to determine the mechanism by which these microorganisms coagulated citrated plasma. As this was the only plasma clotted, it was presumed that the citrate was utilized by the microorganisms, thereby releasing the calcium which was then made available so that normal physiological clotting could occur. To test this hypothesis, a chromatographic method was employed to determine the presence or absence of citrate. Coagulation tests, by use of increasing amounts of citrate, showed a linear relationship between the amount of citrate in the plasma and the coagulation time. It was demonstrated that the organisms must be actively metabolizing to clot citrated plasma. Proof for this was obtained by using a cell-free filtrate, to which thimerosal had been added to inhibit growth, instead of whole cultures for the coagulation test. Only the coagulase-positive staphylococci coagulated the citrated plasma under these conditions. From the results obtained, it was concluded that plasma coagulation by these organisms was by citrate utilization.
TI  - HAIR AS A RESERVOIR OF STAPHYLOCOCCI.
AB  - The occurrence of Staphylococcus aureus in the hair of the scalp was investigated in three groups: out-patients, in-patients, and staff of a general hospital. Bacteria were grown from the hair of all the subjects tested and Staphylococcus aureus was the commonest pathogen isolated. It was found more frequently in the hair than in the nose but 20% of hair carriers of Staph. aureus were not nasal carriers. In hospital staff and in-patients, the staphylococci were highly resistant to antibiotics, and phage types usually classified as ;hospital staphylococci' predominated. There were more staphylococcal post-operative wound infections in hair carriers than in non-carriers, and in three cases the Staph. aureus was of the same phage type as that isolated pre-operatively from the hair.

AB  - This study considers the sanitary significance of coliforms, fecal coliforms, and streptococci isolated from 152 species of plants and 40 samples of insects. These specimens were collected from various ecological environments and grouped into several categories. Results indicate that typical coliforms of the warm-blooded animal gut contribute a relatively small percentage of the organisms associated with vegetation (14.1%) and insects, (14.9%). A total of 1,203 coliform strains from vegetation and 1,084 coliform strains from insects were classified as to IMViC type and fecal coliform. No type was predominant in either the vegetation or insect groupings. The biochemical results for 646 streptococci from vegetation and 226 cultures from insects were reported. The predominant group, Streptococcus fecalis, as defined by Sherman criteria, constituted a majority of all strains from vegetation and insects. The "Completed Coliform Test" is recommended for the examination of plant and insect specimens to eliminate the many anaerobic and aerobic sporeforming bacteria that frequently produce false positive reactions by the "Confirmed Test" procedure. These findings support the current interpretation of the significance of the fecal coliform test for stream investigations or for surface water quality evaluations.

Bacteriol. 86:702-707. 1963.-A survey has been made of bacteriocine production by a wide variety of well-characterized strains of group D streptococci. On the basis of spectrums and sensitivity to chloroform, heat, and proteolytic enzymes, five distinct bacteriocines can be defined. Type 1 is produced by all Streptococcus zymogenes (S. faecalis var. zymogenes) strains, is active against a wide variety of gram-positive bacteria, and is also a hemolysin. Type 2 is produced by some S. liquefaciens (S. faecalis var. liquefaciens) strains, and acts on many enterococci as well as on certain other lactic acid bacteria. Type 3 is produced by certain strains of both S. faecalis and S. faecium, and inhibits a wide variety of group D streptococci, but is inactive against all other lactic acid bacteria tested except Leuconostoc citrovorum. Type 4 is produced by certain S. faecium strains and resembles in certain ways the type 3 activity, but differs from it in other ways. Type 5 has been found to be produced by only one proteolytic strain of S. zymogenes, and this bacteriocine has a very narrow spectrum. The strain that produces this bacteriocine also produces type 1 activity. No strain is sensitive to a bacteriocine of the type it produces.

AB  - Toennies, G. (Institute for Cancer Research, Philadelphia, Pa.), L. Iszard, N. B. Rogers, and G. D. Shockman. Cell multiplication studied with an electronic particle counter. J. Bacteriol. 82:857-866. 1961.-Suitable conditions are described for the application of the Counter electronic particle counter to the study of bacterial number and particle size distribution in growing cultures. When Streptococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli were each grown in a different medium, exponential growth was accompanied by a continuous decrease in average particle size. The average apparent particle volume of S. faecalis decreased by about 50% in five generations. Microscopic studies of S. faecalis indicated that this was due to a decrease in the average chain length of the cultures. The following observations concerning average particle size during exponential growth of S. faecalis in a synthetic medium were made: (i) A decreased concentration of tryptophan, serine, or proline resulted in a significant decrease in average particle size. Similar changes in numerous other nutrients produced no or only minor changes. (ii) The addition of a cytoplasmic extract prepared from exponentially growing cells resulted in changes similar to those resulting from the partial withdrawal from the medium of certain nutrients. (iii) The effect of the cytoplasmic extract could be counteracted by the addition of tryptophan. (iv) A limited survey, including the effects of the rate of exponential growth, mechanical agitation, the presence of indoleacetic acid, indole, kinetin, lysozyme, or ascorbate, disclosed no additional factor which significantly influenced the particle size distribution.
