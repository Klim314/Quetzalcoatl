TI  == recovery of putative periodontal pathogens from curette sampling at different depths of periodontal lesions: an in vivo cross-sectional clinical study.
AB  == objective: the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the depth of curette sample collection from periodontal lesions on the recovery of putative periodontal pathogens using real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr). methods: twenty-two periodontal pockets 6 to 8 mm deep with bleeding on probing at a single-rooted tooth were sampled, yielding 66 separate samples. curette samples were obtained at three different levels of the periodontal lesion (orifice, shallow--2 mm into the pocket; or base of lesion), and processed using pcr to identify 10 periodontal pathogens. the chi-square procedure was used to determine whether probe depth affected the distribution of bacterial counts observed. a repeated measures analysis of variance tested the hypotheses related to level of  probe and microorganism on mean rank of bacterial counts. results: the effect of  probe level on mean bacterial counts depends on the type of microorganism. likewise, the effect of microorganism type on mean bacterial counts significantly depends on probe level, where sampling from 2 mm into the periodontal pocket was  found to yield significantly higher results than sampling from the orifice. overall mean counts of pathogenic microorganisms were found to differ significantly across the three probe depths. the microorganisms differed in their observed levels over all three probe levels. further analysis found several significant differences that characterize the nature of the interaction between probe level and microorganism type. conclusion: there is significant difference in the amount of putative periodontal pathogens at varying depths of the pocket when sampled with a periodontal curette.

TI  == microbial leakage at the implant/abutment connection due to implant insertion maneuvers: cross-sectional study 5 years post loading in healthy patients.
AB  == abstract the aim of this study was to test if stress on the prosthetic connection during insertion maneuvers can induce micro-warping at the implant-connection. from sept 2011 to july 20134, patients with implants loaded at least 5 years that were placed with two different insertion implant mounters - mp (conventional) and me (mountless) - were selected from all those that had received dental implant therapy in the past and coming to routine check-up or spontaneous visits during the study period. patients having implants loaded at least 5 years that were placed with two different insertion implant mounters - mp (conventional) and me (mountless) - were recruited. samples were obtained from inside the connection and the abutment surface (cias) using absorbent sterile paper tips. qrt-pcr was performed for total bacterial counts and loads of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), tannerella forsythensis (tf), treponema denticola (td), prevotella intermedia (pi), peptostreptococcus micros (pm), fusobacterium nucleatum (fn), campylobacter rectus (cr), eikenella corrodens (ec), and candida albicans (ca). the anova test  was used to test for differences. nine patients (20 implants, mp group) and 5 patients (10 implants, me group) were included. regarding the red complex, tf was seen in 80% and 30% of mp and me implants respectively (p<0.001). significant differences were also found in microbial load. for td, proportions were 45% vs. 10% (p=0.022) with no significant differences at load levels. regarding the orange complex, higher prevalence values were found in mp implants, although differences were non-significant. microbial load levels for orange complex bacteria were higher for mp than me, being these differences statistically significant for fn (4.94 vs 3.09; p=0.001). finally, ec was only detected in the  mp group, and ca and aa were not found in either group. within its limitation (small sample size, retrospective analysis, indirect measurement method), the present study suggest that aa mounter not impacting on the prosthetic connection  should be used to reduce microbial contamination of implants.

TI  == the presence of cariogenic and periodontal pathogens in the oral cavity of one-year-old infants delivered pre-term with very low birthweights: a case control study.
AB  == background: recently, the dental literature has focused mainly on the microbial colonization of healthy full-term infants and their mothers or caretakers. however, oral microbial acquisition by premature infants has not been adequately  investigated, and the correlation between pre-term birth and the presence of cariogenic and periodontal pathogens has not been determined. the aim of this study was to identify the presence and quantities of representative cariogenic and periodontal pathogens in the oral cavities of 12-month-old infants and compare the occurrence of these microbes between a cohort of pre-term infants with very low birthweights and a control cohort comprising full-term infants. methods: the research cohort was composed of 69 one-year-old infants, of whom 24  were born prematurely with very low birthweights and 45 of whom were carried to full term. information regarding the infants' gestational age, mode of delivery,  general health status, birthweight and antibiotic use were obtained from hospital records and through oral interviews. at 12 months of age, both groups of infants  were examined, and unstimulated saliva samples from the dorsum of the tongue and  dental plaque samples were collected. the microorganisms (streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus spp., actinomyces spp., aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, peptostreptococcus micros, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum) were identified and their quantities were evaluated using a pcr-based method. the chi-squared and fisher's factorial tests were used for the statistical evaluations. results: the infants had a high prevalence of cariogenic microbes and of fusosbacterium nucleatum and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. cariogenic microbes were detected in 91.7% of the very low birthweight infants and in all full-term infants. periodontal pathogens were present in 83% of the pre-term infants and in 96% of the full-term infants. a significant difference was found between the cohorts in terms of the presence of s. mutans. most of the  very low birthweight infants had negative values of this microbe, while the full-term infants had positive values. conclusions: this study confirms the early transmission of representative cariogenic and periodontal pathogens to the oral cavity of one-year-old infants and a higher prevalence of s. mutans in full-term  infants than in premature infants.

TI  == a comparative antimicrobial analysis of various root canal irrigating solutions on endodontic pathogens: an in vitro study.
AB  == background and objectives: evolution in understanding the poly-microbial environment of both endodontic infections and that of failed root canal treatments has been debatable over the years. the present study was designed to compare and analyze the effect of various root canal irrigation solutions on certain endodontic pathogens in vitro. materials and methods: to analyze in vitro the zone of inhibition of the micro-organisms the following irrigating solutions  were employed: a. sodium hypochlorite (naocl) 5% b. sodium hypochlorite (naocl) 3% c. chlorhexidine 2% d. chlorhexidine (chx) 0.12% e. doxycycline 0.01% f. doxycycline 0.005% g. mtad. an agar culture plate inoculated with four endodontic pathogens was used namely 1. enterococcus faecalis (mtcc-439) 2. candida albicans (mtcc-183) 3. fusobacterium nucleatum (atcc-25586) 4. peptostreptococcus anaerobius (atcc-27337) the inoculums were streaked out on the trypticase soy agar plate for discrete colonies with a wire loop using standard method. the inoculated plates carrying the antibiotic disks were incubated in an anaerobic jar in the following way-anaerobic incubation-the following procedure was used to provide anaerobiosis with an increased concentration of carbon dioxide. by this method the zone of inhibition obtained by different irrigating solutions against  different pathogens could be compared. results: mtad showed maximum antibacterial activity. in case of c. albicans mtad was less effective than 5% naocl, 3% naocl  and 2% chx, 0.12% chx. however, it was more effective against e. faecalis, f. nuleatum and p. anaerobicus. in any case, antimicrobial activity is not the only  prerequisite for an endodontic irrigant. e. faecalis strain used in this study showed resistance to doxycycline; also doxycycline was ineffective against c. albicans at 0.01% and 0.005% concentrations. conclusion: it was found that mtad was more antimicrobial than 5% naocl for some of the test micro-organisms; however the ability of mtad to dissolve pulp tissue is not comparable to 5% naocl. in addition, 5 and 3% naocl showed signifcant antimicrobial activity against all test micro-organisms. the best option for a primary endodontic irrigant therefore is 5% naocl.

TI  == microbiological assessment of the implant-abutment interface in different connections: cross-sectional study after 5 years of functional loading.
AB  == objective: to evaluate the bacterial microflora present inside the implant connection and in the peri-implant sulcus fluid of healthy implants, and to analyze the relationships between these harboring sites for four different implant systems after at least 5 years of functional loading. materials and methods: a cross-sectional study was performed involving 40 patients treated with metal-ceramic cemented bridges supported by at least two healthy implants functionally loaded for 5 years. four different implant-abutment connections were studied: external hexagon (control group), double internal hexagon (test group 1), internal hexagon with external collar (test group 2), and conical connection  (test group 3). samples for microbiological analysis were obtained from three types of sites: peri-implant sulci, connections' inside and abutments surface and, as control, gingival sulci of neighboring teeth. quantitative real-time pcr  was carried out for total bacterial count and for 10 microorganisms: aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythensis, treponema denticola, prevotella intermedia, peptostreptococcus micros, fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, and candida albicans. the response variables were percentage of positive sites and absolute bacterial load. the relations of the response variables with the type of connection and of sampling site were assessed using generalized estimating equations. results: regarding the analysis of positivity to bacteria in the peri-implant sulcus no significant differences were observed. analyzing the connection's inside, none of the connection designs had the capacity to prevent microbiological leakage through the implant/abutment microgap. test group 3 presented the lowest mean values for red complex bacteria and control group the highest, although differences were non-significant. statistical significance was  only reached for treponema denticola in the bacterial load analysis inside the connection. test groups 1 and 2 yielded lower values for orange complex bacteria  but only for peptostreptococos micros the differences resulted significant. test  groups 2 and 3 had significantly lower total bacterial counts in the peri-implant sulcus and inside the connection. conclusions: outcomes suggested that all the analyzed connections resulted contaminated after 5 years of functional loading. however, the connection design might influence bacterial activity levels qualitatively and quantitatively, especially inside the implant connection.

TI  == preservation of fusobacterium nucleatum and peptostreptococcus anaerobius dna after loss of cell viability.
AB  == aim: to investigate whether dna from two obligate anaerobes, fusobacterium nucleatum and peptostreptococcus anaerobius, is recoverable after loss of cell viability induced by air exposure. methodology: harvested cultures of f. nucleatum and p. anaerobius were killed by exposure to air and stored in phosphate-buffered saline. dead cells were incubated aerobically for up to 6 months. every month, the presence of detectable dna in the cell pellet and supernatant was assessed by conventional and quantitative pcr. cell staining techniques were used to characterize the cell wall permeability of air-killed cells. scanning electron microscopy was used to examine viable, freshly killed and stored cells. results: with conventional pcr, amplifiable dna was detectable  over 6 months in all samples. quantitative pcr showed a progressive fall in dna concentration in nonviable cell pellets and a concomitant rise in dna concentration in the supernatant. dna staining showed that some air-killed cells  retained an intact cell wall. after storage, sem of both air-killed species revealed shrivelling of the cells, but some cells of p. anaerobius retained their initial form. conclusion: amplifiable dna from f. nucleatum and p. anaerobius was detectable 6 months after loss of viability. air-killed anaerobes initially retained their cell form, but cells gradually shriveled over time. the morphological changes were more pronounced with the gram-negative f. nucleatum than the gram-positive p. anaerobius. over 6 months, there was a gradual increase in cell wall permeability with progressive leakage of dna. bacterial dna was recoverable long after loss of cell viability.

TI  == the effects of a mineral trioxide aggregate-based sealer on the production of reactive oxygen species, nitrogen species and cytokines by two macrophage subtypes.
AB  == aim: to test the effects of a mineral trioxide aggregate-based sealer (mta fillapex((r))) and mta (mta-angelus((r))) on viability and on the production of cytokines, reactive oxygen species (ros) and nitrogen species (no) by m1 and m2 inflammatory macrophages. methodology: m1 (from c57bl/6 mice) and m2 (from balb/c mice) peritoneal inflammatory macrophages were obtained and cultured in vitro in  the presence of original and diluted extracts of mta and mta fillapex (flpx). the cell viability, ros release and the release of tumour necrosis factor-a, interleukin (il)-12, il-10 and no in response to stimulation with interferon-gamma and fusobacterium nucleatum or peptostreptococcus anaerobius were evaluated. the data were analysed using the mann-whitney test and student's  t-test. results: fillapex was cytotoxic at the highest concentrations (1:1;1:2) and decreased the viability (p < 0.05) of both macrophage types (<20%). mta did not interfere with cellular viability. flpx inhibited the release of ros and decreased no release in f. nucleatum and p. anaerobius -stimulated m1 and m2 macrophages (</=25 mu mol l(-1)). f. nucleatum-stimulated m2 macrophage cultures  released lower levels of tnf-alpha when flpx was added (</=1 ng ml(-1)). m2 macrophages released higher (>5 ng ml(-1)) levels of il-10 than m1 macrophages. only m1 macrophage cultures produced il-12p70. conclusions: fillapex impaired effector immune responses during inflammation (m1 macrophages), as well as during healing (m2 macrophages) responses.

TI  == the effects of different orthodontic appliances upon microbial communities.
AB  == objectives: orthodontic appliances can promote accumulation of dental plaque, with associated enamel decalcification or gingival inflammation. the aim of this  study was to examine longer-term microbiological changes during orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances. materials and methods: twenty-four orthodontic patients aged 11-14 years undergoing fixed appliance therapy were recruited into  the study. each was randomized for cross-mouth assignment of molar bands and bonded molar tubes to contralateral quadrants of the mouth. all patients received self-ligating brackets, but again using randomization, one upper lateral incisor  bracket (left or right) also received an elastomeric ligature. plaque samples from the molars and upper lateral incisors were obtained at intervals during treatment and up to 1 year after appliance removal. denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and 16s rdna microarray were used to compare plaque microbial fingerprints. results: plaque populations changed within 3 months of commencing treatment at all sites. the greatest differences in plaque composition were seen  with self-ligating brackets with an elastomeric ligature. post-treatment plaque associated with both types of molar attachment contained increased levels of periodontal pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and eubacterium nodatum, while campylobacter rectus, parvimonas micra, and actinomyces odontolyticus were also elevated with bonds. conclusions: the results suggest that orthodontic treatment may cause sustained changes in plaque microbiotas and that molar bond-associated plaque may have raised disease potential.

TI  == oral microbial colonization in laryngectomized patients as a possible cofactor of biofilm formation on their voice prostheses.
AB  == aim: biofilm formation on voice prostheses, which are used for voice rehabilitation in laryngectomized patients, is a main cause of device failure. the aim of this study was to assess whether the presence of periodontal pathogens in the biofilm on voice prostheses is related to that in the oral cavity and associated with the periodontal status of the patients. methods: thirty-one laryngectomized patients were invited to participate, 13 of whom met exclusion criteria. the remaining 18 were classified according to the community periodontal index of treatment needs (community periodontal index of treatment needs (cpitn), grades 0-4). biofilm samples from the oral cavity and voice prostheses were analysed by pcr-based hybridization for 11 pathogens. results: all dentate patients required periodontal treatment (cpitn-3: n = 4, cpitn-4: n = 8); the remaining six were edentulous. the diversity (i.e. number of bacterial species detected) of pathogens detected on the voice prostheses correlated significantly  positively with the diversity of pathogens in the oral cavity and with clinical parameters. furthermore, the diversity of pathogens differed significantly between dentate and edentulous patients. conclusions: results emphasize the oral  cavity as an important source of bacteria for biofilm formation on voice prostheses. whether these pathogens reduce the lifetime of the device by increased biofilm formation and/or increase the risk of silicone deterioration requires further study.

TI  == subgingival root brushing in deep human periodontal pockets.
AB  == objective: the short-term clinical and microbiological effects of patient-applied subgingival root brushing were assessed on untreated deep human periodontal pockets. methods: assessments of plaque, bleeding on probing, probing depth, total cultivable subgingival counts, and cultivable counts and proportions of six putative periodontal pathogens were carried out at baseline and after 14 days on  two contralateral > or = 6 mm bleeding interproximal posterior sites in each of 11 adults with untreated chronic periodontitis. one of the sites was randomly assigned to daily patient-applied subgingival root brushing for 14 days, and the  other to remain with the patient's pre-existing tooth brushing and flossing regimen. no other periodontal therapy was performed during the 14 test days. results: significant reductions in plaque, bleeding on probing, probing depth, total subgingival counts, and levels of putative periodontal pathogens were found after 14 days of subgingival root brushing. subgingival root brushing nearly eliminated bleeding on probing at test sites, reduced probing depths by a mean of 1.8 mm, and reduced cultivable subgingival proportions of six evaluated putative  periodontal pathogens from a cumulative total of 14.1% to 0.8%. in comparison, no significant clinical or microbiological changes were detected after 14 days where the patient's pre-existing oral hygiene regimen remained unaltered. conclusions:  subgingival root brushing over 14 days, in properly trained patients, induced favorable clinical and microbiological changes in deep periodontal pockets > or = 6 mm even in the absence of professional subgingival debridement.

TI  == the microbiology of the peri-implant sulcus following successful implantation of  oral prosthetic treatments.
AB  == background: oral implants are widely used in partially and fully edentulous patients; however, the integration of an implant can be endangered by factors such as intraoral bacteria or inflammatory reactions. the purpose of this study was to evaluate the microbial flora present in the sulcus around dental implants  and to assess the relationship between gingival health and microbial flora present. materials and methods: twenty patients who had received oral implants with no complications were followed for a period of 9 months. assessment of probing depth, the presence of bleeding on probing and microbial sampling from the peri-implant sulcus were performed at three different time points- 4 weeks after surgery, 1 month and 6 months after loading. the samples were taken by paper points and transferred to the microbiology lab in thioglyocolate cultures.  in order to do a colony count and isolate the aerobic capnophilic and anerobic bacteria the samples were cultured and incubated on laboratory media. the colonies were also identified using various diagnostic tests. alterations in the  presence of various bacterial species over time and gum health were tested using  analysis of variance (anova) with tukey's test post hoc. results: the average pocket depth for each patient ranged from 1.37 +/- 0.39 mm to 2.55 +/- 0.72 mm. the bacteria isolated from the cultured samples included aerobic, facultative anerobic, obligate anerobic and capnophilic bacteria. conclusion: the anerobic conditions created in the peri-implant sulcus might with time enhance the number  of anerobic bacteria present following dental implant loading.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of mtad and nisin in combination against common pathogens associated with root canal infection.
AB  == introduction: many pathogenic microorganisms were found in an infected root canal. the object of this study was to evaluate the effect of mtad in combination with nisin on the pathogens associated with root canal infection. methods: the survival rates of 9 pathogenic bacteria were determined after 1-, 5-, and 10-minute treatment with mtad, mtan (substitution of doxycycline with nisin), and mtadn (nisin in combination with doxycycline). the survival rates of enterococcus faecalis in the starvation phase and pretreatment alkalization as well as in the  normal physiological state under mtad, mtan, and mtadn challenge for 1, 5, and 10 minutes were evaluated and compared. furthermore, scanning electron microscopy was used to observe the morphologic modification of actinomyces naeslundii, lactobacillus paracasei, and porphyromonas gingivalis after mtad and mtadn treatment. results: l. fermenti, l. paracasei, a. viscosus, a. naeslundii, streptococcus gordonii, and peptostreptococcus were more sensitive to mtadn and mtan than to mtad. mtad, mtan, and mtadn showed a rapid antibacterial effect on p. gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and fusobacterium nucleatum. enterococcus faecalis in the stress state was as sensitive to mtad, mtan, and mtadn as the control e. faecalis. furthermore, in the observation of scanning electron microscopy, the membranes in a. naeslundii and l. paracasei presented significant rupture, and p. gingivalis did not exhibit significant damage after mtadn treatment. conclusions: mtad in combination with nisin improved antibacterial efficacy against pathogens, especially for some gram-positive bacteria associated with persistent intracanal infection. therefore, the combination had the potential to be used as an effective intracanal irrigation.

TI  == reactivation of latent hiv-1 by a wide variety of butyric acid-producing bacteria.
AB  == latently infected cells harbor human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) proviral dna copies integrated in heterochromatin, allowing persistence of transcriptionally silent proviruses. it is widely accepted that hypoacetylation of histone proteins by histone deacetylases (hdacs) is involved in maintaining the hiv-1 latency by repressing viral transcription. hiv-1 replication can be induced from latently infected cells by environmental factors, such as inflammation and co-infection with other microbes. it is known that a bacterial metabolite butyric acid inhibits catalytic action of hdac and induces transcription of silenced genes including hiv-1 provirus. there are a number of such bacteria in gut, vaginal, and oral cavities that produce butyric acid during their anaerobic glycolysis. since these organs are known to be the major site of  hiv-1 transmission and its replication, we explored a possibility that explosive  viral replication in these organs could be ascribable to butyric acid produced from anaerobic resident bacteria. in this study, we demonstrate that the culture  supernatant of various bacteria producing butyric acid could greatly reactivate the latently-infected hiv-1. these bacteria include fusobacterium nucleatum (commonly present in oral cavity, and gut), clostridium cochlearium, eubacterium  multiforme (gut), and anaerococcus tetradius (vagina). we also clarified that butyric acid in these culture supernatants could induce histone acetylation and hiv-1 replication by inhibiting hdac. our observations indicate that butyric acid-producing bacteria could be involved in aids progression by reactivating the latent hiv provirus and, subsequently, by eliminating such bacterial infection may contribute to the prevention of the aids development and transmission.

TI  == cytokine expression in response to root canal infection in gnotobiotic mice.
AB  == aim: to examine cytokine expression profiles during periapical lesion development in response to synergetic human pathogens in a gnotobiotic mouse model. methodology: human strains of fusobacterium nucleatum and peptostreptococcus prevotii were inoculated into the root canals of germ-free mice in either mono- or bi-association. animals were killed 7 and 14 days after infection, and periapical tissues were collected. mrna expression of the cytokines ifn-gamma, tnf-alpha, receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-b ligand (rankl), il-10, il-4 and transforming growth factor beta (tgf-beta) was assessed using real-time  pcr. levene's test was used to assess the equality of variance of the data, whereas a t-test for independent samples was used to evaluate the significance of the differences between groups (p < 0.05). results: the mrna expression of ifn-gamma and tnf-alpha was up-regulated by f. nucleatum during the acute (day 7) and chronic phase (day 14) of periapical lesion development. however, in bi-infection the expression of ifn-gamma and tnf-alpha were effectively absent at both time-points. rankl mrna expression was down-regulated during dual infection  at the chronic phase. as il-4 expression was similar at both time-points, il-4 does not appear to be involved in the periapical response to these bacterial strains. il-10 was up-regulated during the chronic phase by mono-infection with either f. nucleatum or p. prevotii. dual infection increased tgf-beta mrna expression on day 7, which paralleled the decrease in ifn-gamma and tnf-alpha mrna levels at the same time-point. f. nucleatum increased tgf-beta mrna expression during the chronic phase. conclusion: cytokine profiles depend on the  nature of the bacterial challenge. both tgf-beta and il-10 appeared to be regulating the proinflammatory cytokine responses at both time-points of the periapical immune response.

TI  == predominant bacterial species in subgingival plaque in dogs.
AB  == background and objective: the dog has been used extensively for experimental and  microbiological studies on periodontitis and peri-implantitis without detailed knowledge about the predominant flora of the subgingival plaque. this study was designed to evaluate the predominant cultivable bacterial species in dogs and compare them phenotypically and genotypically with corresponding human species. material and methods: four subgingival samples were taken from two upper premolars in each of six labrador retrievers. the samples from each dog were processed for anaerobic culture. from the samples of each dog, the five or six predominating bacteria based on colony morphology were selected and pure cultured. each of the strains was characterized by gram stain, anaerobic/aerobic  growth and api-zym test. eighteen strains showing clear-cut phenotypic differences were further classified based on dna sequencing technology. cross-reactions of dna probes from human and dog strains were also tested against a panel of both human and dog bacterial species. results: thirty-one strains in the dogs were isolated and characterized. they represented 21 different species,  of which six belonged to the genus porphyromonas. no species was found consistently in the predominant flora of all six dogs. porphyromonas crevioricanis and fusobacterium canifelinum were the two most prevalent species in predominant flora in dogs. dna probes from human and dog species cross-reacted to some extent with related strains from humans and dogs; however, distinct exceptions were found. conclusion: the predominant cultural subgingival flora in  dogs shows great similarities with the subgingival bacteria from humans at the genus level, but distinct differences at the species level; however, a genetic relatedness could be disclosed for most strains investigated.

TI  == investigation of six selected bacterial species in endo-periodontal lesions.
AB  == aim: to investigate and determine possible associations of six tested bacteria belonging to 'orange' and 'green' complexes, in endo-periodontal lesions: parvimonas micra, fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, eubacterium nodatum, eikenella corrodens and capnocytophaga sputigena. methodology: forty-six patients presenting with different types of endo-periodontal lesions were investigated. clinical examinations, periapical radiographs and microbiological sampling from the canal system (endo) and periodontal pockets (perio) were performed. qualitative and semiquantitative evaluation of bacteria was performed  by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) and dna-dna hybridization (micro-ident plus; hain lifescience, germany). results: extremely high bacterial loads in endodontic samples were recorded for p. micra, f. nucleatum and c. sputigena, while periodontal samples were often colonized by the same species, plus c. rectus. significant association was recorded between f. nucleatum-endo and p. micra-endo  (p = 0.03, fisher's exact test). there was marginal evidence of associations between: (i) c. sputigena-endo and c. sputigena-perio (p = 0.06, fisher's exact test); (ii) p. micra-endo and p. micra-perio (p = 0.05, fisher's exact test). sensitivity to percussion was associated with an increased chance of cases with p. micra-endo (p = 0.03, pearson chi-square test). conclusion: the findings suggest that f. nucleatum, p. micra and c. sputigena may play a role in the pathogenesis of endo-periodontal lesions.

TI  == short-term periodontal and microbiological changes following orthognathic surgery.
AB  == objective: aim of the present study was to evaluate the influence of orthognathic surgery on the development of periodontal and microbiological changes. materials  and methods: fifteen consecutively treated patients with a mean age of 24.9+/-7.7 years receiving orthognathic surgery were included in the present study. plaque index (pi) and concentrations of 11 periodonto-pathogenic bacteria were recorded  one day prior to surgery (t(0)) and one week (t(1)) and six weeks (t(2)) post-surgery. in addition, a complete periodontal examination including pocket probing depth (ppd), gingival recession (gr), clinical attachment level (cal), bleeding on probing (bop) and width of keratinized gingiva (wkg) was conducted at t(0) and t(2). for statistical analysis, general linear model and paired t-test were applied. results: a significant increase of pi (t(0)-t(1), p=0.037) was followed by a significant decrease (t(1)-t(2), p=0.017). apart from eikenella corrodens (p=0.036), no significant microbiological changes were recorded. ppd significantly increased on oral sites (p=0.045) and gr especially on buccal sites (p=0.001). in the incision area the development of gr was significantly higher on the test (buccal) than on the control sites (oral). both gingival biotypes were affected by gr. conclusions: orthognathic surgery causes statistically significant changes of periodontal parameters, but these changes do not necessarily impair the aesthetic appearance of the gingival margin.

TI  == analysis of the antimicrobial susceptibility of anaerobic bacteria isolated from  endodontic infections in brazil during a period of nine years.
AB  == introduction: the purpose of this study was to analyze the susceptibility of some anaerobic species isolated from a brazilian population at different periods of time by determining a pattern of development of resistance to frequently prescribed antibiotics in endodontics. methods: root canal samples were collected from infected teeth at different periods of time (2000-2002, 2003-2005, and 2007-2008) and microbiologically identified with conventional culture techniques. the susceptibility of prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, p. oralis, fusobacterium  nucleatum, and p. micra isolated strains was determined by the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of amoxicillin, amoxicillin + clavulanate, benzylpenicillin,  clindamycin, erythromycin, and metronidazole by using the e-test method. results: amoxicillin and amoxicillin + clavulanate were effective against the majority of  species at the different periods of study. overall, there were low statistical differences regarding the microbial susceptibility between the experimental periods. however, an increase in the anaerobic resistance to penicillin g and clindamycin was observed. resistance to erythromycin was observed in all species, and there were statistically significant differences between 2000-2002 and 2003-2005 periods for f. nucleatum (p < .05) and between 2003-2005 and 2007-2008  periods for p. intermedia/nigrescens and p. oralis (p < .05). conclusions: the antimicrobial resistance of anaerobes isolated from primary endodontic infections showed an increase throughout a period of time regarding a specific brazilian population.

TI  == synergistic growth effect among bacteria recovered from root canal infections.
AB  == the objective of this study was to determine the ecological relationships between bacterial species that colonize infected root canals. root canal bacteria recovered from one patient with pulp canal necrosis were evaluated in vitro for synergistic and antagonistic activities determined by mono and co-culture growth  kinetics and the production of bacteriocin-like substances using the double layer diffusion method. peptostreptococcus prevotii triggered a significant increase of fusobacterium nucleatum growth, while the former bacteria did not affect the growth of p. prevotii. the bacterial species did not produce antagonism activity  against itself or against any of the other two species. despite many studies have demonstrated the capability of root canal microorganisms to produce antagonistic  substances, these in vitro experimental tests show the synergistic effect of p. prevotii on the growth of f. nucleatum.

TI  == clinical periodontal and microbiologic parameters in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.
AB  == background: a limited number of studies suggest a prevalence of periodontal pathogens in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (ra); however, results are inconsistent. the aim of this study is to investigate clinical periodontal and microbiologic parameters in patients with ra. methods: sixty-six patients with ra, aged 49.5 +/- 8.4 years, participated in the study. the periodontal classification was assessed with the periodontal screening index (psr/psi) allocated to the following parameters: 1) healthy; 2) gingivitis (psr/psi score 0 to 2, maximum one sextant score; 3) moderate periodontitis (>1 sextant psr/psi score 3, maximum one sextant score; or, 4) severe periodontitis (>1 sextant psr/psi score 4). pool samples were taken for microbiologic (polymerase chain reaction) analysis for the presence of 11 periodontal pathogens. statistical analysis was by non-parametric analysis of covariance. results: no patients were  periodontally healthy: 24 patients were classified as having gingivitis; 18 patients had moderate periodontitis; 23 patients had severe periodontitis; and one patient was toothless. for most patients, fusobacterium nucleatum (98%), eikenella corrodens (91%), and parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros; 88%) were above the detection threshold. strong periodontal pathogens were less frequently detected: aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously  actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, 16%); porphyromonas gingivalis (58%); and tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis, 78%). statistical analysis showed no significant influence of rheumatic factor (p = 0.33) on periodontal classification and on microbiologic parameters (p >0.05). only smoking showed a significant influence (p = 0.0004) on the periodontal classification and in the case of e. corrodens (p = 0.02). conclusions: most patients with ra in this study showed moderate-to-severe periodontitis and the presence of periodontal pathogens. no association was found between rheumatic factor on periodontal classification and microbiologic parameters.

TI  == salivary blood group antigens and microbial flora.
AB  == objective: secretor is an individual with ability to produce blood group reactive substances in the exocrine glands and to secrete these substances in the body fluids such as saliva. in saliva the blood reactive antigens are found primarily  on mucins which exhibit microheterogenicity and different subtypes of these molecules. this study was done to find out if the salivary blood group antigens have any role in the adherence of certain selected microorganism in the oral cavity. methods: unstimulated whole saliva and sub gingival plaque samples were collected from subjects with clinically healthy gingival, chronic gingivitis and  chronic periodontitis with probing pocket depth >/=4mm and attachment loss >/=1mm. secretor status was determined by using haemagglutination inhibition assay. unstimulated whole saliva and sub gingival plaque samples were collected to culture and isolate the selected microorganisms. the clinical scores, secretor status and the presence or absence of selected microorganisms were compared within the groups using chi-square test and students unpaired t-test. results: the numbers of secretors were more in the healthy group (22.2%) and non secretors were more in the chronic periodontitis group (22.2%). the clinical scores were higher in the in non secretors compared to the secretors in all the three groups. p intermedia and p gingivalis were prevalent among non secretors in chronic gingivitis group. (p=0.075 and p=0.032) and chronic periodontitis group (p=0.068  and p=0.009).

TI  == evaluation of three swab transport systems for the maintenance of clinically important bacteria in simulated mono- and polymicrobial samples.
AB  == in this study, three swab transport systems were evaluated: m40 transystem, amies broth with a relatively new type of swab (both copan diagnostics, corona, ca, usa), and ssi transportmedium (statens serum institut, copenhagen denmark). the clsi m40-a standard procedures and 11 culture collection strains were used. the transport systems were tested at room temperature for holding times of 0, 24, and 48 h, and both mono- and polymicrobial samples were included. after 24 h of simulated transportation, all systems were able to maintain the viability of all  organisms tested. ssi transportmedium exhibited the lowest maintaining ability, whereas the two copan systems were the most growth-promoting system. in polymicrobial samples, this latter feature was a problem. at 48 h, no transport system could maintain the viability of all strains, and the recovery rates differed depending on organism and device. the species most difficult to recover  in all the three systems was neisseria gonorrhoeae. when selecting a swab transport system, consideration must be given to the sample type, the conditions  that prevail locally, and the performance in the clinical setting.

TI  == early bacterial colonization and soft tissue health around zirconia and titanium  abutments: an in vivo study in man.
AB  == aim: to compare the early bacterial colonization and soft tissue health of mucosa adjacent to zirconia (zro(2)) and titanium (ti) abutment surfaces in vivo. materials and methods: twenty edentulous subjects received two endosseous mandibular implants. the implants were fitted with either a zro(2) or a ti abutment (non-submerged implant placement, within-subject comparison, left-right  randomization). sulcular bacterial sampling and the assessment of probing pocket  depth, recession and bleeding on probing were performed at 2 weeks and 3 months post-surgery. wilcoxon matched-pairs, sign-rank tests were applied to test differences in the counts of seven marker bacteria and the clinical parameters that were associated with the zro(2) and ti abutments, at the two observation time points. results: zro(2) and ti abutments harboured similar counts of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, peptostreptococcus micros, fusobacterium nucleatum and treponema denticola at 2 weeks and 3 months. healthy clinical conditions were seen around both zro(2) and ti abutments at all times, without significant differences in most clinical parameters of peri-implant soft tissue health. mean probing depths around ti abutments were slightly deeper than around  zro(2) abutments after 3 months (2.2 sd 0.8 mm vs. 1.7 sd 0.7 mm, p=0.03). conclusions: no difference in health of the soft tissues adjacent to zro(2) and ti abutment surfaces or in early bacterial colonization could be demonstrated, although somewhat shallower probing depths were observed around zro(2) abutments  after 3 month.

TI  == oxygen tension modulates the cytokine response of oral epithelium to periodontal  bacteria.
AB  == background: there is an inverse relationship between pocket depth and pocket oxygen tension with deep pockets being associated with anaerobic bacteria. however, little is known about how the host tissues respond to bacteria under differing oxygen tensions within the periodontal pocket. aim: to investigate the  effect of different oxygen tensions upon nuclear factor-kappa b (nf-kappab) activation and the inflammatory cytokine response of oral epithelial cells when exposed to nine species of oral bacteria. materials and methods: h400 oral epithelial cells were equilibrated at 2%, 10% or 21% oxygen. cells were stimulated with heat-killed oral bacteria at multiplicity of infection 10:1, escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (15 mug/ml) or vehicle control. interleukin-8 (il-8) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and nf-kappab activation was measured by reporter vector or by immunohistochemical analysis. results: tannerella forsythensis, porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia elicited the greatest epithelial nf-kappab activation and cytokine responses. an oxygen-tension-dependent trend in cytokine production was observed with the highest il-8 and tnf-alpha production observed at 2% oxygen and lowest at 21% oxygen. conclusions: these data demonstrate a greater pro-inflammatory host response and cell signalling response to bacteria present in more anaerobic conditions, and hypersensitivity of epithelial cells to pro-inflammatory stimuli  at 2% oxygen, which may have implications for disease pathogenesis and/or therapy.

TI  == microbiota around teeth and dental implants in periodontally healthy, partially edentulous patients: is pre-implant microbiological testing relevant?
AB  == this study aimed to assess the prevalence of seven periodontal marker pathogens,  before implant placement and 1 yr after loading, in periodontally healthy individuals and to assess the long-term effectiveness of pre-implant reduction of pathogens to below threshold levels. in 93 individuals needing single tooth replacement, pooled subgingival microbiological samples from standard sites were  cultured and analyzed before implant treatment and 1 yr after loading. threshold  levels commonly used in periodontology to predict periodontal breakdown were applied. subjects with levels of pathogens above these thresholds received initial periodontal treatment including systemic antibiotics when indicated. at baseline, 49.5% of periodontally healthy subjects harboured one or more marker pathogens above threshold levels. periodontal treatment reduced the pathogen levels below threshold values in 78.3% of these initially colonized subjects. in  all cases aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis were reduced to below threshold. at 1 yr after loading, periodontal pathogens were present above threshold levels in 74.1% of all subjects. it is concluded that in  almost half of periodontal healthy individuals the subgingival biofilm harbours periodontal pathogens above threshold values. long-term effectiveness of pre-implant reduction of the selected marker pathogens appeared limited in our patient population, making pre-implant reduction unpredictive for post-implant levels of these pathogens. thus, considering the applied microbiological criteria, generalized pre-implant microbiological testing is not contributory in  periodontally healthy subjects.

TI  == [identification of anaerobic bacteria isolated from various clinical specimens and determination of antibiotic susceptibilities].
AB  == routine isolation, identification and susceptibility testing of anaerobic bacteria present several difficulties leading to defects in the determination of  local susceptibility patterns which will guide empirical treatment protocols. this study was carried out to identify the anaerobic bacteria isolated from various clinical materials obtained from the suspected patients with anaerobic infection and to determine the antibiotic susceptibilities against several antibiotics. one hundred clinical specimens (36 blood, 31 abscess, 12 peritoneal  fluid, 7 joint fluid, 7 pleural fluid, 3 biopsies, 3 cerebrospinal fluids and 1 surgical wound) that were examined in our laboratory during march 20-october 30 2007, were included in the study. the specimens were collected and transported under anaerobic conditions and inoculated to conventional aerobic media and to wilkins chalgren agar, schaedler agar and chopped-meat broth for anaerobic isolation. isolated anaerobic bacteria were identified with api 20a panels (bio-merieux, france) via conventional methods and by the help of an-ident discs  (oxoid, england). penicillin g, clindamycin, cefoxitin, metronidazole, piperacillin/tazobactam and imipenem susceptibility tests were performed with e-  test method. twenty two anaerobic bacteria were isolated from 14 clinical specimens; 7 of the specimens yielding the growth of more than one type of anaerobic bacteria and 8 specimens yielding both anaerobic and facultative anaerobic bacterial (4 escherichia coli and 4 enterococcus spp.) growth. anaerobic bacteria were isolated in 89 abscess and in 6 peritoneal fluid specimens. the distribution of the anaerobic bacteria identified among these specimens were as follows: bacteroides fragilis (n = 6), bacteroides spp. other than b.fragilis (n = 4), clostridium spp. (n = 2), fusobacterium necrophorum/nucleatum (n = 1), prevotella intermedia/disiens (n = 1), peptococcus niger (n = 2), peptostreptococcus spp. (n = 5), and lactobacillus acidophilus/lenseii (n = 1). beta-lactamase activity was detected only in 2 of the 6 b. fragilis isolates. all of the isolates were susceptible to imipenem and  piperacillin/tazobactam. the highest rate of resistance was detected against penicillin g (9/22; 41%). while anaerobic gram-positive cocci (n = 7) were found  to be sensitive to all antibiotics, the rate of resistance among anaerobic gram-negative bacilli were 75% (9/12) to penicillin, 33.3% (4/12) to clindamycin, 8.3% (1/12) to metronidazole. among anaerobic gram-positive bacilli (n = 3), 2 were resistant to metronidazole, one to clindamycin and one to cefoxitin. the results of this first anaerobic antimicrobial susceptibility testing study performed at konya area in turkey revealed that penicillin was not appropriate in empirical treatment of anaerobic infections, clindamycin susceptibility should be tested before use, metronidazole and cefoxitin could be used in empirical treatment and imipenem and piperacillin/tazobactam should be saved for the treatment of complicated infections and infections caused by resistant bacteria.

AB  == objective: to investigate the competition between probiotics in bio-yogurt and periodontal pathogens in vitro. material and methods: the antimicrobial activity  of bio-yogurt was studied by agar diffusion assays, using eight species of putative periodontal pathogens and a 'protective bacteria' as indicator strains.  four probiotic bacterial species (lactobacillus bulgaricus, streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus acidophilus, and bifidobacterium) were isolated from  yogurt and used to rate the competitive exclusion between probiotics and periodontal pathogens. results: fresh yogurt inhibited all the periodontal pathogens included in this work, showing inhibition zones ranging from 9.3 (standard deviation 0.6) mm to 17.3 (standard deviation 1.7) mm, whereas heat-treated yogurt showed lower antimicrobial activity. in addition, neither fresh yogurt nor heat-treated yogurt inhibited the 'protective bacteria', streptococcus sanguinis. the competition between yogurt probiotics and periodontal pathogens depended on the sequence of inoculation. when probiotics were inoculated first, bifidobacterium inhibited porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas circumdentaria, and prevotella nigrescens; l. acidophilus inhibited p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. circumdentaria, p. nigrescens, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius; l. bulgaricus inhibited p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, and p. nigrescens; and s. thermophilus inhibited p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum, and p. nigrescens. however, their antimicrobial properties were reduced when both species (probiotics and periodontal pathogens)  were inoculated simultaneously. when periodontal pathogens were inoculated first, prevotella intermedia inhibited bifidobacterium and s. thermophilus. conclusions: the results demonstrated that bio-yogurt and the probiotics that it contains are  capable of inhibiting specific periodontal pathogens but have no effect on the periodontal protective bacteria.

TI  == innate inflammatory responses of human decidual cells to periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  == objective: the purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that periodontopathic bacteria exert potent proinflammatory effects in human decidua.  study design: the immunostimulatory effects of gram-positive and negative periodontopathic bacteria and their lipopolysaccharides were tested in human decidual cell cultures in comparison with escherichia coli. cytokine production was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; inflammatory gene expression was measured by oligonucleotide arrays and quantitative real time-polymerase chain reaction. results: all bacteria that were tested elicited an inflammatory response, although concentration-dependence and efficacy varied considerably with organism and culture. lipopolysaccharides were more potent stimuli than intact bacterial cells, although bacteria exerted greater effects at high concentrations. of 112 genes on the arrays, 18 genes were stimulated significantly by one or more lipopolysaccharide preparation. conclusion: the ability of periodontopathic bacteria to stimulate a decidual inflammatory response is highly variable and partly dependent on the presence and structure of constituent lipopolysaccharides. this adds to our understanding of the causal association between periodontal disease and preterm birth.

TI  == photodynamic therapy in periodontal therapy: microbiological observations from a  private practice.
AB  == in recent years, the combination of laser light and photosensitizer known as photodynamic therapy (pdt) has been used in periodontal therapy. however, there are not enough clinical studies to fully evaluate the effects of pdt on the periodontal tissues. this microbiological study examined the effects of pdt on the periodontal bacteria in combination with scaling and root planing (srp) in the same group of patients by randomly selecting pdt or srp for use in different  quadrants of the mouth. for the present study, pdt was compared with a diode laser (980 nm) and an nd:ya g laser (1,064 nm). microbiological samples were examined and evaluated over a period of three months. significant bacterial reduction has been observed in all cases. the diode laser with srp presented long-term positive results, while pdt showed a significant bacteria reduction during the entire observation period.

TI  == the bactericidal effect of a genius nd:yag laser.
AB  == purpose: to evaluate the 'in vitro' bactericidal effect of the nd:yag laser (genius, molsgaard dental, copenhagen, denmark) on six periodontal pathogens. methods: suspensions of six different periodontal pathogens (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, fusobacterium nucleatum and parvimonas micra) were prepared in small eppendorff tubes, and exposed to a nd:yag laser for five different periods of time. laser settings used: power 6 watt (on a scale of 1-12 w), frequency 50 hz, pulse duration 250 mus. after exposure to the laser, aliquots of the suspensions were spread on blood agar plates for bacterial counting. results: after 5 s of laser exposure, there was a decrease in total colony forming units for all six selected microorganisms. after 15, 30 and 45 s, no viable bacterial cells could be retrieved. conclusion: in this 'in vitro' model, 15 s of nd:yag laser use was found to be effective for total killing of the six tested periodontal pathogens.

TI  == osteoradionecrosis contains a wide variety of cultivable and non-cultivable bacteria.
AB  == background: direct microscopy, anaerobic culture and dna-dna hybridization have previously demonstrated an association between microorganisms and osteoradionecrosis (orn). the purpose of our study was to use culture independent molecular techniques to detect bacteria in necrotic bone lesions of the mandible  after radiation therapy. design: bacterial dna was extracted from eight deep medullar specimens from resected mandibles (six cases), including one patient with relapse. 16s rrna genes were pcr amplified, cloned, transformed into escherichia coli and sequenced to determine species identity and closest relatives. results: from the analysis of 438 clones, 59 predominant species were  detected, 27% of which have not been cultivated. the predominant species detected from radionecrotic mandibles were campylobacter gracilis, streptococcus intermedius, peptostreptococcus sp. oral clone fg014, uncultured bacterium clone  rl178, fusobacterium nucleatum, and prevotella spp. the study demonstrated intersubject variability of the bacteria present in orn. in contrast to the diverse bacterial profile detected in primary infection, only a few members of the oral indigenous flora were identified from the relapse case. conclusions: diverse bacterial profiles in specimens of orn in marrow spaces of the mandible were detected by culture independent molecular techniques. to better understand the pathogenesis and to improve the therapy of the infection, detection of all members of the complex bacterial flora associated with orn is necessary.

TI  == assessment of intraradicular bacterial composition by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis.
AB  == background: the aim of the study was to assess the bacterial community structures associated with endodontic infections using terminal restriction fragment length  polymorphism (t-rflp), and to investigate the correlation of whole community profiles with the manifestation of particular clinical features. methods: intraradicular samples were collected from 34 subjects and classified into three  study groups based on the observed clinical symptoms: acute (n = 16), sub-acute (n = 8), and asymptomatic (n = 10). genomic dna was extracted from each sample, submitted to polymerase chain reaction using a fluorescently labeled 16s ribosomal dna forward primer, and digested with two tetrameric endonucleases (hhai and mspi). the terminal restriction fragments (t-rfs) were subsequently discriminated in an automated dna sequencer, and the results were filtered using  a statistics-based criterion. results: totals of 138 (hhai) and 145 (mspi) unique t-rfs were detected (means 13.1 and 11.9) and there was high inter-subject variability in the bacterial assemblages. odds-ratio analysis unveiled the existence of higher order groups of positively associated t-rfs, restating the concept that intricate ecological relationships may take place in the root canal  space. a significantly greater t-rf prevalence was detected in acute cases, suggesting a straight correlation between species richness and spontaneous pain.  conclusion: overall, no t-rflp profile representing a specific bacterial consortium could be associated with the manifestation of symptoms of endodontic origin.

TI  == bone microbial contamination influences autogenous grafting in sinus augmentation.
AB  == background: the oral occurrence of putative microbial pathogens in humans has been documented in health and disease. the presence of periodontopathogens in patients with a history of periodontal disease may have a negative impact on bone regeneration. this investigation was conducted to confirm the presence of periodontal pathogens in bone particles harvested intraorally for maxillary sinus augmentation and to assess the clinical and radiographic outcomes 6 to 12 months  after bone augmentation. methods: culture and polymerase chain reaction (pcr)-based identification were performed by paper-point sampling of intraorally  harvested bone particles in a group of 12 maintenance patients undergoing maxillary sinus augmentation. radiographs were taken to assess and compare bone healing and volume gain at baseline and at 6 to 12 months after augmentation. results: the presence of periodontal pathogens (porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans [previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans], prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia [previously t. forsythensis], fusobacterium nucleatum, parvimonas micra [previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros], campylobacter rectus, enteric gram-negative rods, and dialister pneumosintes) was identified in 10 of 12 patients (83%) by culture, pcr, or both and was associated with greater bone volume loss at 6 months postaugmentation. the pcr-positive triad, p. gingivalis,  a. actinomycetemcomitans, and p. intermedia, was associated with pronounced volume loss of the grafted sinus at 6 months. conclusions: to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to confirm osseous microbial contamination with major periodontopathogens in individuals undergoing maxillary sinus augmentation with a history of periodontitis. the effect on the grafting outcome  translated into bone volume loss in the grafted sinus 6 months postaugmentation.  specific microbial contamination may have an impact on osteogenesis in osseous regeneration.

AB  == aim: to compare polymerase chain reaction (pcr) with subsequent reverse hybridization (micro-ident test) and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization for the identification of 13 bacterial species in subgingival plaque samples. material and methods: subgingival plaque samples were taken using paper points and curettes from two sites each with pocket depth <4, 4-6 and >6 mm at baseline and  3 months in 25 periodontitis subjects and two sites in 25 periodontally healthy subjects. samples were analysed for their content of 13 bacterial species using both assays. similarities for each species between techniques were determined using regression analysis. differences between health and periodontitis were determined using the mann-whitney test. results: three hundred and fifty samples  were evaluated using both techniques. regression analysis indicated that 10/13 test species showed significant positive correlations between the counts determined by checkerboard analysis and levels determined by the pcr-based test after adjusting for 13 comparisons. the highest rank correlations of 0.58, 0.49 and 0.46 were seen for treponema denticola, fusobacterium nucleatum and eubacterium nodatum, respectively (p<0.0001). both tests could distinguish samples from healthy and periodontitis subjects. conclusion: detection patterns of 10/13 test species in subgingival plaque samples from periodontitis and healthy subjects were similar using the two molecular techniques.

TI  == starvation response and growth in serum of fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, prevotella intermedia, and pseudoramibacter alactolyticus.
AB  == the microbiota inhabiting the untreated root canal differ markedly from those found in post-treatment disease, yet there is limited information on the microbial characteristics distinguishing the different infections. we hypothesized that starvation survival is a key microbial property in species selection. this study analyzed starvation-survival behavior over 60 days of species representative of the untreated root canal infection: fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, prevotella intermedia and pseudoramibacter alactolyticus. all species did not survive 1 day in water. in 1% serum, the 4 species could not survive beyond 2-3 weeks. they required a high initial cell density and >or=10% serum to survive the observation period. the results highlight a poor starvation-survival capacity of these 4 species compared with species prevalent in post-treatment infection, which are well equipped to endure starvation and survive in low numbers on minimal serum. these findings point to starvation-survival capacity as a selection factor for microbial participation in post-treatment disease.

TI  == fetal exposure to oral pathogens and subsequent risk for neonatal intensive care  admission.
AB  == background: maternal periodontal infection has been associated with adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes. in utero fetal exposure to oral pathogens was also recognized as deleterious to the fetus. the objective of this study was to determine the relationship between fetal exposure to oral pathogens and neonatal  intensive care unit (nicu) admission. methods: this was a secondary analysis of a prospective cohort study of maternal oral health and pregnancy outcome. fetal immunoglobulin m against oral pathogens was detected in umbilical cord serum by immunoblot. the presence of at least one oral pathogen-specific antibody was considered seropositivity. the cord level of c-reactive protein was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and categorized as detectable versus undetectable. chi-square and logistic regression analyses were used to determine  the association between cord serum seropositivity or detectable c-reactive protein and nicu admission and length of stay. results: of 650 infants, 45 (6.9%) were admitted to the nicu. the admission rate was higher among seropositive infants compared to seronegative infants (11% versus 5%; p = 0.0019). seropositive infants were also more likely than seronegative infants to stay >3 or >7 days (8% versus 3% and 6% versus 2%; p = 0.004 and 0.003, respectively). adjusting for gestational age, the odds ratio (95% confidence interval) for nicu  admission was 2.14 (1.01 to 4.54); for a length of stay >3 or >7 days, it was 2.38 (1.01 to 5.60) and 3.29 (1.13 to 9.58), respectively. the nicu admission rate was not significantly higher for those with detectable versus undetectable umbilical cord serum c-reactive protein (8% versus 6%; p = 0.3). conclusions: in  utero fetal exposure to oral pathogens increases the risk for nicu admission and  the length of stay. interventions that interrupt fetal exposure to oral pathogens may reduce these risks.

TI  == does pregnancy have an impact on the subgingival microbiota?
AB  == background: we investigated clinical and subgingival microbiologic changes during pregnancy in 20 consecutive pregnant women > or =18 years not receiving dental care. methods: bacterial samples from weeks 12, 28, and 36 of pregnancy and at 4  to 6 weeks postpartum were processed for 37 species by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. clinical periodontal data were collected at week 12 and at 4 to 6  weeks postpartum, and bleeding on probing (bop) was recorded at sites sampled at  the four time points. results: the mean bop at week 12 and postpartum was 40.1% +/- 18.2% and 27.4% +/- 12.5%, respectively. the corresponding mean bop at microbiologic test sites was 15% (week 12) and 21% (postpartum; not statistically significant). total bacterial counts decreased between week 12 and postpartum (p  <0.01). increased bacterial counts over time were found for neisseria mucosa (p <0.001). lower counts (p <0.001) were found for capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, eubacterium saburreum, fusobacterium nucleatum naviforme, fusobacterium nucleatum polymorphum, leptotrichia buccalis, parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros), prevotella intermedia, prevotella melaninogenica, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguinis, selenomonas noxia, and veillonella parvula. no changes occurred between weeks 12 and 28 of pregnancy. counts of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), and  treponema denticola did not change. counts of p. gingivalis and t. forsythia at week 12 were associated with gingivitis (p <0.001). conclusions: subgingival levels of bacteria associated with periodontitis did not change. p. gingivalis and t. forsythia counts were associated with bop at week 12. a decrease was found in 17 of 37 species from week 12 to postpartum. only counts of n. mucosa increased.

TI  == the microbiota of acute apical abscesses.
AB  == as the breadth of bacterial diversity in the oral cavity has been deciphered by molecular studies, several newly identified species/phylotypes have emerged as potential pathogens. we hypothesized that many of these species/phylotypes could  also be involved with the etiology of endodontic abscesses. abscess aspirates from 42 persons were analyzed for the presence of 81 species/phylotypes by means  of a reverse-capture checkerboard hybridization assay. associations between the most frequently detected taxa were calculated. the most prevalent taxa were fusobacterium nucleatum, parvimonas micra, and porphyromonas endodontalis. other  frequently found taxa included olsenella uli, streptococci, eikenella corrodens,  some as-yet-uncultivated phylotypes (bacteroidetes clone x083 and synergistes clone ba121), and newly named species (prevotella baroniae and dialister invisus). several positive bacterial associations were disclosed. findings not only strengthen the association of many cultivable species with abscesses, but also include some newly named species and uncultivated phylotypes in the set of candidate pathogens associated with this disease.

AB  == this study assessed the prevalence and microbial interactions of fusobacterium nucleatum and fusobacterium necrophorum in primary endodontic infections from a brazilian population and their antimicrobial susceptibility to some antibiotics by the e-test. one hundred ten samples from infected teeth with periapical pathologies were analyzed by culture methods. five hundred eighty individual strains were isolated; 81.4% were strict anaerobes. f. nucleatum was found in 38  root canals and was associated with porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella spp., and eubacterium spp. f. necrophorum was found in 20 root canals and was associated with peptostreptococcus prevotii. the simultaneous presence of f. nucleatum and f. necrophorum was not related to endodontic symptoms (p > 0.05). they were 100% susceptible to amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, and cephaclor. fusobacterium spp. is frequently isolated from primary-infected root canals of teeth with periapical pathologies. amoxicillin is a useful antibiotic against f. nucleatum and f. necrophorum in endodontic infections and has been prescribed as the first choice in brazil.

TI  == uncultivated bacteria as etiologic agents of intra-amniotic inflammation leading  to preterm birth.
AB  == intra-amniotic infection and inflammation are major causes of preterm birth (ptb). however, intra-amniotic inflammation is often detected in the absence of infection. this may partly be due to the culturing methods employed in hospital laboratories, which are unable to detect the uncultivated species. in this study, intra-amniotic microbial infections associated with ptb were examined by both culture and 16s rrna-based culture-independent methods and were corroborated by the presence of intra-amniotic inflammation. amniotic fluid (af) specimens from 46 pregnancies complicated by ptb and 16 asymptomatic women were analyzed. no bacterial dna was amplified in af collected from the asymptomatic women. among the 46 samples associated with ptb, bacterial dna was amplified from all (16/16)  of the culture-positive samples and 17% (5/30) of the culture-negative samples. in the culture-positive group, additional species were detected in more than half (9/16) of the cases by pcr and clone analysis. altogether, approximately two- thirds of the species detected by the culture-independent methods were not isolated by culture. they included both uncultivated and difficult-to-cultivate species, such as fusobacterium nucleatum, leptotrichia (sneathia) spp., a bergeyella sp., a peptostreptococcus sp., bacteroides spp., and a species of the  order clostridiales. to examine intra-amniotic inflammation, an af proteomic fingerprint (mass-restricted score) was determined by surface-enhanced laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry. inflammation was detected in all five samples which were culture negative but pcr positive. women who were  pcr positive more often had elevated interleukin-6 levels in their af, histological chorioamnionitis, and funisitis and delivered neonates with early-onset neonatal sepsis. previously unrecognized, uncultivated, or difficult-to-cultivate species may play a key role in the initiation of ptb.

TI  == molecular identification and quantification of bacteria from endodontic infections using real-time polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == introduction: it was the aim of the present study to evaluate root canal samples  for the presence and numbers of specific species as well as for total bacterial load in teeth with chronic apical periodontitis using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr). methods: forty adult patients with one radiographically documented periapical lesion were included. twenty teeth presented with primary infections and 20 with secondary infections, requiring retreatment. after removal of necrotic pulp tissue or root canal filling, a first bacterial sample was obtained. following chemo-mechanical root canal preparation  a second sample was taken and a third sample was obtained after 14 days of intracanal dressing with calcium hydroxide. analysis by real-time pcr enabled the quantification of total bacterial counts and of nine selected species. results: root canals with primary infections harbored significantly more bacteria (by total bacterial count) than teeth with secondary infections (p < 0.05). mean total bacterial count in the retreatment group was 2.1 x 10(6) and was significantly reduced following root canal preparation (3.6 x 10(4)) and intracanal dressing (1.4 x 10(5)). corresponding values for primary infections were: 4.6 x 10(7), 3.6 x 10(4), and 6.9 x 10(4). the numbers of the selected bacteria and their detection frequency were also significantly reduced. conclusion: root canals with primary infections contained a higher bacterial load. chemo-mechanical root canal preparation reduced bacterial counts by at least 95%.

AB  == introduction: to facilitate the identification of anaerobes cultivated from periodontal disease, whole cell bacterial identification by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof-ms) was evaluated. methods: a total of 84 strains (nine reference strains and 75 recent clinical isolates from 33 patients with aggressive periodontitis) previously identified with phenotypic methods were used. all the references and 10 clinical  isolates belonging to the same species as the reference strains were genotypically identified by sequence analysis of the 16s ribosomal rna gene. all  the strains were then analyzed using maldi-tof-ms. results: the reference strains of anaerobic bacteria used showed characteristic maldi-tof-ms spectra with peaks  between m/z 2000 and up to about m/z 13,000. on visual inspection, the similarity of spectra produced by strains of a single genus could be recognized. obvious differences between spectra produced by strains of different species were also easily noticed. the reproducibility of the method was proved by the similarity of spectra belonging to the same species. the spectra of the prevotella intermedia strains identified with maldi clustered together and clustered separately from the spectra of prevotella nigrescens, proving that maldi-tof-ms is an accurate method that is capable of separating these two species. the quality of clustering was characterized by calculating an inconsistency coefficient (mathworks:/matlab  reference manual v2007a/, statistical toolbox). conclusion: our results suggest that maldi-tof-ms might become a useful method for the identification of anaerobic bacteria, especially for those that cannot be readily identified by biochemical analysis. it may become an attractive system even for the routine identification of clinical isolates.

TI  == the role of toll-like receptors 2 and 4 on reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide production by macrophage cells stimulated with root canal pathogens.
AB  == introduction: periapical lesions arise as a result of the activation and interaction of the host immune responses against root canal infection. recently identified toll-like receptors (tlr) seem to be involved in the recognition and development of immune responses against a myriad of microorganisms. however, very little information is available on the role of tlr in the induction of periapical lesions. method: the role of tlr-2 and tlr-4 in the activation of murine macrophages stimulated using fusobacterium nucleatum and peptostreptococcus anaerobius was investigated. the production of nitric oxide (no) and reactive oxygen species (ros) was assessed. results: the results demonstrate that tlr-2 and tlr-4 are involved in the production of ros by activated macrophages. the microorganisms induced similar levels of no production by tlr-2-competent and tlr-2-deficient macrophages, regardless of the addition of interferon-gamma (ifn-gamma), ruling out a role for tlr-2 in the no production induced by these bacteria. only p. anaerobius induced no production by tlr-4-competent macrophages without the addition of ifn-gamma. however, after ifn-gamma addition, f. nucleatum induced macrophage no production. therefore, no production stimulated by ifn-gamma and these microorganisms seems to be tlr-4-independent. conclusion:  tlr-2 seems to be involved in the induction of ros production by macrophages in response to prevalent root canal bacteria, while only f. nucleatum induced ros production by tlr-4-competent macrophages. both microorganisms significantly induced large amounts of no independent of tlr-2 and tlr-4. we conclude that microorganisms may participate in the induction and progression of periapical lesions through no and ros production by activated macrophages.

AB  == human beta-defensin-3 (hbd3), an endogenous antimicrobial peptide, has strong broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. this study aimed to obtain recombinant hbd3 (rhbd3) and to test the hypothesis that the antimicrobial characteristics of hbd3 may offer an advantage over conventional medicine in reducing intracanal bacteria. genetic engineering was used to obtain active rhbd3 and analysis revealed that it exhibited a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity at low micromolar concentrations against not only staphylococcus aureus and escherichia  coli but also against some critical pathogenic microbes in infected root canals,  including fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella melaninogenica, peptostreptococcus  anaerobius, streptococcus mutans, actinomyces naeslundii, enterococcus faecalis and candida albicans. in an in vitro antibacterial experiment, rhbd3 significantly eliminated pathogenic bacteria in root canals. the ratio of bacterial death was up to 98%. we conclude that hbd3 has the potential to eliminate bacteria effectively and rapidly in the local microenvironment of the root canal system and that it may contribute to successful endodontic treatment.

TI  == tongue biofilm areal density and tongue coating index.
AB  == two methods have been employed to measure the amount of tongue biofilm in humans: (1) areal density of microbes (cfu cm(-2)) (tongue scrape from a known/measured area), or (2) a tongue-coating index, where a human judge assesses the amount of  'coating' by visual inspection. the two methods were compared, both on human volunteers and on artificial biofilms. fusobacterium nucleatum (fn), prevotella intermedia (pi), streptococcus mutans (sm) and peptostreptococcus micros (pm) were obtained from stock cultures. tongue scrape samples were obtained from four  human volunteers in order to inoculate the in vitro matrices. a further 16 individuals (total n = 20) were co-measured for both visible tongue coating and quantitative biofilm (cfu cm(-2)). tongue scrape suspensions were used to inoculate a cellulose matrix resting on a bhi-blood agar plate, periodically hydrated with sterile bhi and incubated for 10 days. visual coating density images were recorded by camera. the relative light absorbance of standard suspensions of cells (pure species) was obtained by spectrophotometry across the  visible spectrum. biomatrix yields (log cfu cm(-2) +/- sd) for fn, pi, sm and pm  were 7.07 (+/-0.04), 7.38 (+/-0.07), 7.25 (+/-0.10) and 7.41 (+/-0.011). higher yields were obtained for tongue-scrape mixed cultures, ranging from 7.47 to 7.76. biofilms (in vitro and in vivo) had different appearances when measured by human  judges in terms of colour, pigmentation and opacity. there was no correlation (r(2) < 0.02) between the two methods. biofilm matrices of similar population densities (ca approximately log 7.5) had widely different opacities depending on  the species present.

TI  == smap29 congeners demonstrate activity against oral bacteria and reduced toxicity  against oral keratinocytes.
AB  == introduction: cathelicidins are antimicrobial peptides found in epithelial and mucosal tissues as well as the secondary granules of neutrophils. smap29, a sheep cathelicidin, has differential antimicrobial properties against various pathogens, including periodontal organisms. the purpose of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial properties and cytotoxicity of smap29, smap28, and three congeners (smap18a, smap18d, and smap14a). methods: the peptides at concentrations ranging from 0.25 to 250 microg/ml were tested for their activity  against multiple strains of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, actinomyces israelii, actinomyces naeslundii, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus micros, and porphyromonas gingivalis using a radial diffusion assay. cytotoxicity of keratinocytes was evaluated by measuring lactate dehydrogenase release after incubation with the individual peptides. results: smap28, thought to be the biologically active peptide, was the most potent antimicrobial (range of minimum  inhibitory concentrations 0.06-7.03 microg/ml, p < 0.05); however, the activity of smap28 and smap29 was strongly associated (r = 0.933). the congeners also demonstrated antimicrobial activity against the bacteria tested (range of minimum inhibitory concnetrations 0.21-79 microg/ml). overall, f. nucleatum was the most  susceptible organism, while p. gingivalis was the least susceptible. keratinocyte cytotoxicity was dependent on peptide length and dose. smap28 was the most cytotoxic, while smap14a was the least cytotoxic. conclusion: the antimicrobial activities against oral microorganisms and the minimal toxicity seen in this study suggest that the congeners of smap29 may serve as an alternative to traditional antibiotics in the prevention and treatment of periodontal and other  oral diseases.

TI  == comparison of growth and susceptibility to sodium hypochlorite of mono- and dual-species biofilms of fusobacterium nucleatum and peptostreptococcus (micromonas) micros.
AB  == this study compared growth and susceptibility to different concentrations of sodium hypochlorite (naocl) of mono- and dual-species biofilms of fusobacterium nucleatum or peptostreptococcus micros in vitro at 24 hours or 96 hours. a mann-whitney u test revealed that although at 24 hours dual-species biofilms had  similar viable counts to those of monospecies biofilms (p > 0.001), they were more resistant to naocl (p < 0.001). at 96 hours, both microorganisms had higher  viable counts and were more resistant to naocl in dual-species biofilms than in monospecies biofilms of the same microorganism (p < 0.001). as the age of the biofilms increased, so did their resistance to naocl. mixed-species biofilms of f. nucleatum and p. micros showed a time-dependent synergy in growth and resistance to naocl.

TI  == production of antagonistic substance by eikenella corrodens isolated from the oral cavity of human beings with and without periodontal disease.
AB  == aims: antagonistic abilities may confer ecological advantages for micro-organisms in competitive ecosystems. however, reports regarding this phenomenon in eikenella corrodens are not available. methods and results: nineteen e. corrodens strains, isolated from the oral cavity of human beings without periodontal disease (n = 5) and with aggressive (n = 9) and chronic (n = 5) periodontitis, as well as a reference strain (e. corrodens atcc23834), were evaluated for antagonistic activity. the following indicators were used: porphyromonas gingivalis fdc381, prevotella intermedia atcc25611, actinomyces israelii atcc12102, eubacterium lentum atcc25559, peptostreptococcus anaerobius atcc27337, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans fdcy4, fusobacterium nucleatum atcc10953, streptococcus sanguinis atcc10557, streptococcus uberis atcc9927, streptococcus mutans im/ufrj, staphylococcus aureus atcc33591 and candida albicans atcc18804. all the strains showed antagonism against at least one of the indicator strains.  this phenomenon was more frequently observed for strains isolated from patients with chronic periodontitis (36.4%), than those from healthy subjects (20.6%) and  those with aggressive periodontitis (10.8%). conclusions: the heterogeneous antagonistic spectrum exhibited by e. corrodens isolates suggests their ability to produce more than one antagonistic substance, whose ecological relevance is yet to be demonstrated. significance and impact of the study: this is the first description of antagonistic compound production by e. corrodens and its relationships with the clinical status of the patients.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity of propolis samples from different geographical origins against certain oral pathogens.
AB  == propolis is an agent having antimicrobial properties, however, its composition can vary depending on the area where it is collected. in the present study, the antimicrobial activity of five propolis samples, collected from four different regions in turkey and from brazil, against nine anaerobic strains was evaluated.  ethanol extracts of propolis (eep) were prepared from propolis samples and we determined minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbc) of eep on the growth of test microorganisms by using agar dilution method. all strains were susceptible and mic values ranged from 4 to 512 microg/ml for propolis activity. propolis from kazan-ankara showed most effective mic values to the studied microorganisms. mbc values of kazan-ankara eep samples  were ranged from 8 to 512 microg/ml. death was observed within 4 h of incubation  for peptostreptococcus anaerobius and micros and lactobacillus acidophilus and actinomyces naeslundii, while 8 h for prevotella oralis and prevotella melaninogenica and porphyromonas gingivalis, 12 h for fusobacterium nucleatum, 16 h for veillonella parvula. it was shown that propolis samples were more effective against gram positive anaerobic bacteria than gram negative ones. the organic chemical compositions of eeps were determined by high-resolution gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (gc-ms). the main compounds of eeps were flavonoids such as pinobanksin, quercetin, naringenin, galangine, chrysin and aromatic acids such as cafeic acid. because of increased antimicrobial resistance, propolis may be kept in mind in the treatment of oral cavity diseases.

TI  == antianaerobe activity of ceftobiprole, a new broad-spectrum cephalosporin.
AB  == agar dilution testing of 463 anaerobes showed most gram-positive beta-lactamase-negative strains (other than some clostridium difficile and peptostreptococcus anaerobius), as well as both beta-lactamase-positive and beta-lactamase-negative strains of fusobacterium nucleatum, to have ceftobiprole  mic values of < or =0.016 to 4 microg/ml. ceftobiprole was less active against beta-lactamase-positive gram-negative bacilli, especially the members of the bacteroides fragilis group. like ceftobiprole, piperacillin was active mainly against beta-lactamase-negative strains, though mic values for piperacillin were  often 1 to 2 dilutions higher than for ceftobiprole. carbapenems had mic values < or =4 microg/l against all except some c. difficile and 2 strains of b. fragilis. all strains were susceptible to metronidazole, and all bacteria, except c. difficile and a single bacteroides distasonis strain, were susceptible to chloramphenicol. clindamycin resistance was seen in most anaerobe groups, whereas high moxifloxacin mics were found mainly among the b. fragilis and prevotella groups, and a few c. difficile and f. nucleatum strains.

TI  == phylogenetic analysis of bacterial and archaeal species in symptomatic and asymptomatic endodontic infections.
AB  == phylogenetic analysis of bacterial and archaeal 16s rrna was used to examine polymicrobial communities within infected root canals of 20 symptomatic and 14 asymptomatic patients. nucleotide sequences from approximately 750 clones amplified from each patient group with universal bacterial primers were matched to the ribosomal database project ii database. phylotypes from 37 genera representing actinobacteria, bacteroidetes, firmicutes, fusobacteria and proteobacteria were identified. results were compared to those obtained with species-specific primers designed to detect prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas  gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, peptostreptococcus micros, enterococcus sp., streptococcus sp., fusobacterium nucleatum, tannerella forsythensis and treponema denticola. since members of the domain archaea have been implicated in  the severity of periodontal disease, and a recent report confirms that archaea are present in endodontic infections, 16s archaeal primers were also used to detect which patients carried these prokaryotes, to determine if their presence correlated with severity of the clinical symptoms. a methanobrevibacter oralis-like species was detected in one asymptomatic and one symptomatic patient. dna from root canals of these two patients was further analysed using species-specific primers to determine bacterial cohabitants. trep. denticola was  detected in the asymptomatic but not the symptomatic patient. conversely, porph.  endodontalis was found in the symptomatic but not the asymptomatic patient. all other species except enterococci were detected with the species-specific primers  in both patients. these results confirm the presence of archaea in root canals and provide additional insights into the polymicrobial communities in endodontic  infections associated with clinical symptoms.

TI  == photodynamic therapy for endodontic disinfection.
AB  == the aims of this study were to investigate the effects of photodynamic therapy (pdt) on endodontic pathogens in planktonic phase as well as on enterococcus faecalis biofilms in experimentally infected root canals of extracted teeth. strains of microorganisms were sensitized with methylene blue (25 microg/ml) for  5 minutes followed by exposure to red light of 665 nm with an energy fluence of 30 j/cm2. methylene blue fully eliminated all bacterial species with the exception of e. faecalis (53% killing). the same concentration of methylene blue  in combination with red light (222 j/cm2) was able to eliminate 97% of e. faecalis biofilm bacteria in root canals using an optical fiber with multiple cylindrical diffusers that uniformly distributed light at 360 degrees. we conclude that pdt may be developed as an adjunctive procedure to kill residual bacteria in the root canal system after standard endodontic treatment.

TI  == influence of residual bacteria on periapical tissue healing after chemomechanical treatment and root filling of experimentally infected monkey teeth.
AB  == the purpose of this study was twofold: first, to determine the influence on the healing of the periapical tissues when selected bacterial strains and combinations thereof remain after root canal treatment; and, second, the relationship to healing of the quality of the root filling. in eight monkeys, 175 root canals, previously infected with combinations of four or five bacterial strains and with radiographically verified apical periodontitis, were endodontically treated, bacteriologically controlled, and permanently obturated.  after 2-2.5 yr, the periapical regions were radiographically and histologically examined. of these teeth, 48 root canals were also examined for bacteria remaining after removal of the root fillings. when bacteria remained after the endodontic treatment, 79% of the root canals showed non-healed periapical lesions, compared with 28% where no bacteria were found. combinations of residual bacterial species were more frequently related to non-healed lesions than were single strains. when no bacteria remained, healing occurred independently of the  quality of the root filling. in contrast, when bacteria remained, there was a greater correlation with non-healing in poor-quality root fillings than in technically well-performed fillings. in root canals where bacteria were found after removal of the root filling, 97% had not healed, compared with 18% for those root canals with no bacteria detected. the present study demonstrates the importance of obtaining a bacteria-free root canal system before permanent root filling in order to achieve optimal healing conditions for the periapical tissues.

TI  == an in vitro time-kill assessment of linezolid and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == linezolid is a novel oxazolidinone antibacterial agent active against staphylococci (including methicillin-resistant strains), enterococci (including vancomycin-resistant strains), streptococci (including penicillin-intermediate and -resistant streptococcus pneumoniae), and other aerobic and facultative bacteria. the agent has also demonstrated activity against a broad spectrum of gram-positive and gram-negative anaerobic bacteria. previous time-kill assessments have shown linezolid to be generally bacteriostatic against staphylococci and enterococci, and bactericidal against streptococci. in this study, an anaerobic glovebox technique was employed to conduct time-kill assessments for four strains of anaerobic gram-positive, and seven strains of anaerobic gram-negative bacteria. the time-kill experiment was performed using anaerobe broth medium. the drugs were tested at four-fold the minimum inhibitory  concentration (mic), or at the higher concentration of 8mg/l for linezolid, 2mg/l for clindamycin, and 8mg/l for metronidazole. samples for viable count were taken at 0, 6, and 24h, and plated using the bioscience international autospiral dw. exposure of samples to the aerobic environment during plating was held to less than 30min. plates were counted after a 48h anaerobic incubation (37 degrees c).  the species tested included bacteroides fragilis (2), b. distasonis, b. thetaiotaomicron, fusobacterium nucleatum, f. varium, prevotella melaninogenica,  clostridium perfringens, eubacterium lentum and peptostreptococcus anaerobius (2). the activity of linezolid was compared to that of metronidazole and clindamycin, two standard anti-anaerobe agents. as expected, the control agents were very active in these assays. metronidazole yielded log(10)cfu/ml reductions  of 3.0 or greater for nine of ten strains; clindamycin yielded log(10)cfu/ml reductions of 2.0 or greater for six of 11 strains, and 3.0 or greater for three  strains. linezolid also produced significant in vitro killing in this model achieving log(10)cfu/ml reductions of 2.0 or greater for six of 11 strains, and 3.0 or greater for four strains. the profile of activity was similar to that of clindamycin indicating that additional developmental studies of linezolid with anaerobic bacteria are warranted.

AB  == the purpose of the present study was to use terminal restriction fragment length  polymorphism analysis and the 16s rrna gene clone library to investigate the diversity of the microbiota associated with asymptomatic and symptomatic endodontic infections and to compare the bacterial community structure in these two clinical conditions. samples were taken from asymptomatic endodontic infections associated with chronic periradicular lesions and from symptomatic infections clinically diagnosed as acute abscesses. 16s rrna genes from dna isolated from clinical samples were used to construct clone libraries or were subjected to terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. sequence analysis of 186 clones revealed 42 taxa; 23 (55%) were uncultivated phylotypes, of which seven were unique to endodontic infections. clone sequencing and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis revealed that the most commonly detected taxa were fusobacterium nucleatum (including terminal restriction fragment types 1 and 2), peptostreptococcus micros/peptostreptococcus sp. oral clone aj062/bs044/fg014, prevotella species, dialister species, mogibacterium species, lachnospiraceae oral clone 55a-34, filifactor alocis, megasphaera sp. oral clone cs025/bs073, and veillonella sp. oral clone bp1-85/veillonella dispar/v. parvula. bacteroides-like sp. oral clone x083/bacteroidales oral clone mce7_20 and dialister sp. oral clone bs016/mce7_134 were detected only in asymptomatic teeth. on the other hand, f. nucleatum terminal restriction fragment type 2, prevotella intermedia, dialister pneumosintes, and some phylotypes were exclusively detected in symptomatic samples. bacterial profiles of symptomatic endodontic infections generated by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis were clearly different from those of asymptomatic infections. overall, the average number of terminal restriction fragments in symptomatic samples was significantly larger than in asymptomatic samples. molecular analysis of the microbiota associated with symptomatic or asymptomatic endodontic infections indicates that the endodontic bacterial diversity is greater than previously described by culture methods and that the structure of the microbiota differ significantly between asymptomatic and symptomatic infections.

AB  == aim: to test the effect of two commercial brands of grey mineral trioxide aggregate (proroot and mta-angelus) on cytokine production by m1 and m2 inflammatory macrophages. methodology: m1 (from c57bl/6 mice) and m2 peritoneal inflammatory macrophages (from c57bl/6 il12p40-/- mice) were obtained and cultured in vitro in the presence of mta. the cellular viability and the production of tumour necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin (il)-12 and il-10 in response to stimulation with interferon-gamma and fusobacterium nucleatum or peptostreptococcus anaerobius were evaluated. data were analysed by mann-whitney, kruskal-wallis and anova tests. results: the cements did not interfere with cellular viability or with cytokine production by either type of macrophage. however, m2 macrophages produced higher levels of il-10 when stimulated with f. nucleatum than m1 macrophages (p < 0.05). conclusions: the brands of mta evaluated did not interfere in the cytokine response by m1 or m2 macrophages to the two bacteria tested. however, a difference in cytokine production between the two types of macrophages was found.

TI  == effect of sodium alendronate on alveolar bone resorption in experimental periodontitis in rats.
AB  == background: bisphosphonates are potent inhibitors of bone resorption and were shown to inhibit bone resorption in experimental periodontitis by unknown mechanisms. we studied the effect of the aminobisphosphonate sodium alendronate (sa) in experimental periodontitis. wistar rats were subjected to ligature placement around the second upper left molars. methods: animals were treated with sa 0.01 to 0.25 mg/kg subcutaneously (sc), either 1 hour before (prophylactic) or starting 5 days after (therapeutic) periodontitis induction and daily until the rats were sacrificed (11 days). controls received saline. animals were weighed daily. alveolar bone loss was measured as the difference (in millimeters) between the cusp tip and the alveolar bone. the periodontium and the surrounding gingivae were examined at histopathology, and the neutrophil influx into the gingivae was  assayed using myeloperoxidase activity. the local bacterial flora was assessed through culture of the gingival tissue in standard aerobic and anaerobic media. results: alveolar bone loss was significantly and dose dependently inhibited by sa either as a prophylactic or therapeutic treatment compared to the control. sa  reduced tissue lesion at histopathology, with partial preservation of the periodontium, coupled to decreased myeloperoxidase activity compared to the control. the reduced neutrophil influx was also shown in carrageenan-induced peritonitis, used as a control experiment for this parameter. sa also significantly inhibited the growth of pigmented bacilli and fusobacterium nucleatum, which are important in the pathogenesis of periodontal disease. sa also inhibited the in vitro growth of isolated peptostreptococcus sp. conclusion: sodium alendronate preserves alveolar bone resorption and has anti-inflammatory and antibacterial activities in experimental periodontitis.

TI  == antibacterial action of photoactivated disinfection {pad} used on endodontic bacteria in planktonic suspension and in artificial and human root canals.
AB  == objectives: to measure antibacterial action of photoactivated disinfection (pad)  on endodontic bacteria in planktonic suspension and root canals. methods: four bacteria, fusobacterium nucleatum,peptostreptococcus micros, prevotella intermedia and streptococcus intermedius, were tested in suspension. after mixing equal volumes of tolonium chloride and bacterial suspension for 60s, each 200 microl of concentration (>10(6)cfu ml(-1)) was irradiated with light at 633+/-2 nm. each energy dose/tolonium chloride concentration combination was tested eight times, with controls. prepared root canals in training blocs and extracted human  teeth were inoculated with s. intermedius followed by 10 mg l(-1) tolonium chloride or saline. bacteria in canals were sampled before and after light irradiation. student t-test assessed significance of changes in viable bacteria produced by treatment of either light or tolonium chloride alone and light/tolonium chloride combinations. results: in suspension, reductions in bacteria were highly significant (p<0.01) for light/tolonium chloride combinations compared to light or tolonium chloride alone. maximum mean log reductions of 1.14 (p. intermedia), 2.48 (p. micros), 2.81 (f. nucleatum) and 6.73 (s. intermedius) were at 4.8 j/20 mg l(-1). antibacterial action was increased by energy dose increase (not always significantly), but not by tolonium chloride concentration. in control canals mean log reductions of 0.42 (blocs) and 0.38 (teeth) from initial levels were not significant. pad mean log reductions of 2.40 (blocs) and 2.01 (teeth) were highly significant. changes for pad/energy dose combinations were not significant. conclusion: pad killed endodontic bacteria at statistically significant levels compared to controls. kills varied with bacterial species.

TI  == antibacterial activity of aqueous extracts of selected chewing sticks.
AB  == this aim of this study was to determine the antibacterial activity in extracts obtained from various nigerian chewing sticks. aqueous extracts from seventeen chewing sticks and the fruit of c. ferruginea, one fruit used in oral hygiene in  nigeria, were screened for antibacterial activity against type cultures of staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. eleven of the test extracts showed activity against at least two of these referenced organisms. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) of these eleven extracts against clinical isolates from orofacial infection were determined. all the extracts demonstrated activity against staphylococcal and streptococcal isolates. over half of the extracts were active against enterobacteriaceae and obligate anaerobic isolates, including prevotella melaninogenica, porphyromonas gigivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and peptostreptococcus prevotii. extracts of the vitellaria paradoxa root, bridellia  ferruginea stem and twigs, garcinia cola stem, terminalia glaucescens root, morinda lucida root, and cnestis ferruginea fruit showed appreciable activity against all classes of bacterial isolates. the extracts of these plants may serve as sources for chemotherapeutic agents for the management of orofacial infections.

TI  == [efficacy variation of erythromycin and spiramycin on periopathogens in aggressive periodontitis. an in vitro comparative study].
AB  == aims: erythromycin (ery) and spiramycin (spi) are the most frequently prescribed  macrolides by dentists. however, the emergence of resistant anaerobic subgingival bacteria imposes an increased vigilance. this study aims to compare these macrolides efficacy on principal periopathogens. materials and methods: twenty adult patients with aggressive periodontitis were selected and a total of 60 samples were taken from subgingival flora. bacterial strains of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus micros and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were isolated  according to j. slots's rapid identification method. the susceptibilities to ery  and spi were studied using disk diffusion susceptibility test and minimum inhibitory concentration test (mic test). results: the efficiency variability of  ery and spi on the 50 isolated anaerobic periopathogens was present either interindividually (between different patients) and intra-individually (within the same patient). while 68% of the tested anaerobic bacteria were sensitive to spi (22% resistant), only 54% were sensitive to ery (34% resistant). although moderate, the efficacy of spi seemed more regular in general than ery: it's variation coefficient (40%) is lower than the ery one (53%). the 7 a. actinomycetemcomitans tested showed all a high resistance. conclusion: in a general way, the spectre of activity of spi is stacked in that of ery. however, this study shows a better and regular activity of spi on the main tested periopathogens. these results are in favour of the use of spi in periodontology when penicillins and doxycycline are not useful because specific problems are identified (allergy, pregnancy...).

TI  == antimicrobial profiles of periodontal pathogens isolated from periodontitis patients in the netherlands and spain.
AB  == background and aim: antimicrobial resistance of periodontal pathogens towards currently used antibiotics in periodontics has been investigated in a previous study. microbial resistance in the periodontal microflora was more frequently observed in spanish patients in comparison with dutch patients. the aim of the present study was to compare antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of five periodontal bacteria isolated from periodontitis patients in spain and in the netherlands. material and methods: subgingival plaque samples from adult patients with periodontitis were collected and cultured on selective and non-selective plates. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum and micromonas micros were isolated and used for minimal inhibitory concentration tests using the epsilometer (e-test) technique. eight different antibiotics were tested on all bacterial isolates. mic50 and mic90 values for each antibiotic and each species were determined and the percentage of resistant strains was calculated. results:  significantly higher mic values were noted in spanish strains of f. nucleatum for penicillin, ciprofloxacin, of p. intermedia for penicillin, amoxicillin and tetracycline, of m. micros for tetracycline, amoxicillin and azithromycin, and of p. gingivalis for tetracycline and ciprofloxacin. based on breakpoint concentrations, a higher number of resistant strains in spain were found in f. nucleatum for penicillin, amoxicillin and metronidazole, in prevotella intermedia for tetracycline and amoxicillin, and in a. actinomycetemcomitans for amoxicillin and azithromycin. resistance of p. gingivalis strains was not observed for any of the antibiotics tested both in spain and the netherlands. conclusions: differences exist in the susceptibility profiles of periodontal pathogens isolated from periodontitis patients in spain and in the netherlands. this implicates that antibiotic susceptibility testing is necessary to determine efficacy of antimicrobial agents. also, clinical studies with antibiotics should  take these differences into account. the information from the present study indicates that it may not be possible to develop uniform protocols for usage of antibiotics in the treatment of severe periodontitis in the european union.

TI  == prevalence of periodontopathic bacteria in aggressive periodontitis patients in a chilean population.
AB  == background: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans is considered a major etiologic  agent of aggressive periodontitis (agp). other periodontopathic bacteria such as  porphyromonas gingivalis are also suspected of participating in aggressive periodontitis although the evidence to support this is controversial. the aim of  the present study was to determine the prevalence of eight periodontopathic bacteria in chilean patients with agp. methods: subgingival plaque samples were collected from 36 aggressive, 30 localized, and six generalized periodontitis patients. samples from 17 advanced chronic periodontitis (cp) patients were taken as controls. samples collected from the four deepest periodontal pockets in each  patient were pooled in prereduced transport fluid (rtf) and cultured. periodontal bacteria were primarily identified by colony morphology under stereoscopic microscope and rapid biochemical tests. the identity of some bacterial isolates was confirmed by colony polymerase chain reaction (pcr). results: agp showed a significatively higher prevalence of c. rectus than cp (p = 0.036). the only statistical difference found was for c. rectus. patients with agp showed a higher, but not statistically significant, prevalence of p. gingivalis, e. corrodens, p. micros, and capnocytophaga sp. a similar prevalence in both groups  of patients was observed for f. nucleatum and p. intermedia/nigrescens, and a. actinomycetemcomitans was less prevalent in agp than cp patients. in localized agp, p. intermedia/nigrescens, e. corrodens, f. nucleatum, and p. micros were the more prevalent pathogens in contrast to generalized agp patients who harbored a.  actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, and capnocytophaga sp. as the most prevalent bacteria. conclusions: c. rectus, p. gingivalis, e. corrodens, p. micros, and capnocytophaga sp. were the most predominant periodontopathic bacteria of agp in this chilean population, but the only statistical difference found here between agp and cp was for c. rectus, suggesting that the differences  in clinical appearance may be caused by factors other than the microbiological composition of the subgingival plaque of these patients. in this study, the prevalence of a. actinomycetemcomitans was much lower than that of p. gingivalis.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility variation of 50 anaerobic periopathogens in aggressive periodontitis: an interindividual variability study.
AB  == background/aims: the frequent use of antibiotics in developed countries has led to the emergence of widespread bacterial resistance. in this study, the interindividual variability of the antibiotic susceptibility of 50 putative microorganisms in aggressive periodontitis patients has been evaluated by means of vc (variation coefficient). material and methods: a total of 60 microbial samples were collected from 20 adult patients diagnosed with aggressive periodontitis (2-4 samples by patient). bacterial strains of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, fusobacterium nucleatum, and peptostreptococcus micros were isolated according to slots' rapid identification method. the susceptibilities to 10 antibiotics were studied: penicillin g (pen), ampicillin (amp), amoxicillin (amx), amoxicillin/clavulanate  (amc), tetracycline (tet), doxycycline (dox), ciprofloxacin (cip), erythromycin (ery), spiramycin (spi) and clindamycin (clin), using the disk diffusion susceptibility test (dds test: kirby-bauer's modified method for anaerobic bacteria). the broth microdilution minimum inhibitory concentration test was carried out as a control test. results: among the 50 identified bacteria, 15 were p. gingivalis, 12 p. intermedia, 8 t. forsythia, 9 f. nucleatum, and 6 p. micros. the results of the dds test show that penicillins (especially amc, amp, and amx), cyclines (especially dox) and clin are highly effective against the 50 anaerobic  studied bacteria. cip and ery have the lowest efficacy against those bacteria. cip shows a very variable activity according to anaerobic bacteria species, being particularly inactive against p. gingivalis and very efficient against t. forsythia and p. micros. spi is also highly efficient but not against p. micros.  conclusions: the interindividual susceptibility of principal periodontal pathogens to antibiotics is not homogeneous and seems to vary according to bacterial species and antimicrobial molecules. this variability seems to be greater with older molecules (pen, tet, ery) than with more recent ones, which indicates more stable results (amc, amx, amp, and dox). p. intermedia appeared to be the bacteria most resistant to penicillins and showed the highest coefficient  variation. together with scaling and root planing, the combination of two antibiotics would therefore seem to be recommended in the treatment of aggressive periodontitis, particularly in the presence of p. intermedia.

TI  == identification of cultivable microorganisms from primary endodontic infections with exposed and unexposed pulp space.
AB  == this study was aimed at comparing the cultivable microorganisms in canals with periapical radiolucencies with exposed and unexposed pulp space. microbiological  samples were taken and analyzed from 45 canals with exposed pulp space, and 43 canals with unexposed pulp space. the canal contents were analyzed by aerobic/anaerobic culture, and conventional identification techniques. there were 211 isolates of bacteria belonging to 28 genera and 55 species recovered from exposed canals. in the unexposed group, 185 isolates of bacteria were recovered,  of which 54 species of 28 genera were identified. among the four most common genera, prevotella was significantly more common in the exposed group (51/211 in  the exposed group versus 30/185 in the unexposed group) (p = 0.049), while there  were no differences in prevalence of actinomyces, peptostreptococcus, and campylobacter between two groups of canals. in addition, fusobacterium nucleatum  and propionibacterium acne were significantly more common in the unexposed canals (p = 0.047 and p = 0.0051, respectively). similarity in bacterial species in these two groups suggests that pulp space exposure may not be a significant factor in determining the type of bacteria present in infected canals.

TI  == tobacco smoking and periodontal microflora in a saudi arabian population.
AB  == objectives: to explore the subgingival periodontal microflora in a saudi arabian  population with a special focus on its relationship with various smoking habits.  material and methods: a total of 198 individuals in the age range 17-60 years were included in the study. 29% were water-pipe smokers, 18% cigarette smokers, 13% smokers of both water pipe and cigarettes (mixed smokers) and 40% non-smokers. for each individual, a subgingival plaque sample from the deepest site in each quadrant was obtained. the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technology was used to determine the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, tannerella forsythensis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, treponoma denticola, peptostreptococcus micros, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens,  selenomonas noxia and streptococcus intermedius. two cut-off levels for detection were used, score 1(10(5) bacteria) and score 3 (10(6) bacteria). results: the prevalence of individuals positive for the different microorganisms at score 1 cut-off varied from 7% to 95%. at score 3 cut-off the prevalence varied from 0% to 30%. the depth of sample site was a key factor for detection. when the depth of sample site was taken into account, no statistically significant differences were observed between cigarette smokers, water-pipe smokers, and non-smokers with regard to occurrence of the microorganisms studied. conclusions: no major differences were observed between cigarette smokers, water-pipe smokers, and non-smokers regarding the occurrence of the periodontal microorganisms studied suggesting that this portion of the subgingival periodontal microflora is independent of tobacco smoking.

TI  == [pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analysis of antibiotic therapy in dentistry and  stomatology].
AB  == introduction: this study evaluates the efficacy of various antimicrobial treatments for orofacial infections on the basis of pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (pk/pd) criteria. methods: a complete a literature search was undertaken to establish the mic90 values of the five microorganisms most frequently isolated in odontogenic infections and the pharmacokinetic parameters of 13 antibiotics used in these infections. pharmacokinetic simulations were then carried out with mean population parameters and efficacy indexes were calculated for the 47 treatment regimens analyzed. for  drugs showing time-dependent antibacterial killing, the time above mic (t > mic)  was calculated. for drugs with concentration-dependent bactericidal activity, the auc/mic was calculated. results: amoxicillin-clavulanic (500 mg/8 h or 1000 mg/12 h) and clindamycin (300 mg/6 h) in the time-dependent killing group and moxifloxacin (400 mg/24 h) in the concentration-dependent group showed adequate efficacy indexes against the five pathogens considered to be the most commonly implicated in odontogenic infections. the spiramycin plus metronidazole combination, present in the commercial formulation rhodogyl, did not reach satisfactory pk/pd indexes. conclusion: pk/pd indexes, which are useful predictors of the potential efficacy of antibacterial therapy, were used with ontogenic infections in the present study. the pk/pd simulations showed that amoxicillin-clavulanic, clindamycin and moxifloxacin were the most suitable antibiotics for this kind of infection. clinical trials are required to confirm that this methodology is useful in these pathologic processes.

TI  == periodontal infections and pre-term low birth weight: a case-control study.
AB  == objective: pre-term delivery of low-birth-weight infants [pre-term low birth weight (plbw)] remains a significant public health issue and a major cause of neonatal death and long-term health problems. there is a growing consensus that infections remote from fetal-placental unit may influence plbw infants. recent studies have suggested that maternal periodontal disease may be an independent risk factor for plbw. the purpose of the present study was to evaluate the possible link between periodontal infections and plbw by means of clinical and microbiological data in post-partum women with low socioeconomic level. methods:  clinical periodontal recordings comprising dental plaque, bleeding on probing, probing pocket depth and gingival recession were performed (six sites/tooth) in a total number of 181 women (53 cases and 128 controls) within 3 days post-partum.  subgingival plaque samples from mesio-or disto-buccal aspect of randomly selected one first molar and one incisor tooth have been obtained by paperpoints and were  analysed by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization with respect to 12 bacterial species. in all analyses, the individual subject was the computational unit. thus, mean values for all clinical parameters were calculated and bacterial scores from each individual sample were averaged. statistical methods included student's t-test, fisher's exact test/chi(2) test, and multiple logistic regression analysis. results: the cases have gained significantly less weight during the pregnancy than did the controls (p<0.05). there were no statistically  significant differences between the cases and controls with regard to the dental  and periodontal parameters and the values of clinical periodontal recordings were found to be very similar (p>0.05). mean and median scores (bacterial loads) of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and streptococcus intermedius in the subgingival plaque sampling sites were significantly higher in the controls than  in the cases (p<0.05). the occurrence rates of p. intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus micros, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens,  selenomonas noxia and s. intermedius were higher in the cases compared with the controls, but the differences were not statistically significant (p>0.05). according to the model created by the multiple logistic regression analysis, p. micros and c. rectus were found to significantly increase the risk of plbw (p<0.01 and p<0.05 respectively), while p. nigrescens and a. actinomycetemcomitans decreased this risk (p<0.01). conclusion: the present findings indicated that when subgingival bacteria were evaluated together, p. micros and c. rectus may have a role in increasing the risk for plbw, although no single bacteria exhibited any relation with the risk of plbw. further studies are required to better clarify the possible relationship between periodontal diseases and plbw.

TI  == coaggregation profiles of the microflora from root surface caries lesions.
AB  == bacterial coaggregation reactions between different species and the auto aggregation of the same species are associated with the initiation and development of dental plaque and biofilms. as no such data is available on isolates from root caries lesions, we evaluated, by a visual, semi-quantitative scoring system and a spectrophotometric, quantitative assay, the coaggregation of 22 different wild-type microbial species comprising ten bacterial genera and a single candida spp. the quantitative coaggregation assay we used proved to be a more sensitive method than the semi-quantitative, visual evaluation as the results yielded the percent coaggregation. fusobacterium nucleatum, lactobacillus acidophilus, streptococcus bovis ii/2 and gemella morbillorum were observed having higher degrees of autoaggregation than the other examined strains. significant levels of inter-species coaggregation was seen between: (1) actinomyces spp. and veillonella spp.; (2) actinomyces israelii and peptostreptococcus prevotii; (3) campylobacter gracilis and actinomyces spp.; (4) prevotella intermedia and nine different species; and (5) fusobacterium nucleatum and six other species. the single candida albicans isolate did not coaggregate to a significant extent with any of the 21 bacterial isolates studied. scanning electron microscopy observation of the coaggregation interactions between bacterial pairs having strong coaggregation reactions revealed varying adhesive patterns. our findings on coaggregation amongst these isolates imply existence of multiple interactions between the coaggregation-inducing bacterial species in root caries. in particular, actinomyces spp., veillonella spp., prevotella spp. and fusobacterium spp. appear to play a significant role in this context.

TI  == periimplantitis.
AB  == orodental rehabilitation through the use of implants offers very high success rates. in this paper, we describe some of the complications involved with this technique, such as periimplant disease and, within this category, periimplantitis, an inflammatory reaction in which there is a loss of the bony support of the implant accompanied by inflammation. the aetiology of the disease  is conditioned by the status of the tissue surrounding the implant, implant design, degree of roughness, the poor alignment of implant components, external morphology and excessive mechanical load. the microorganisms most commonly associated with implant failure are spirochetes and mobile forms of gram-negative anaerobes, unless the origin is the result of simple mechanical overload. diagnosis is based on changes of colour in the gum, bleeding and probing depth of periimplant pockets, suppuration, x-ray and gradual loss of bone height around the tooth. treatment will differ depending upon whether it is a case of mucositis or periimplantitis. therapeutic objectives focus on correcting technical defects  by means of surgery and decontamination techniques (abrasion with carbon particles, citric acid solution, topical tetracycline application and laser surgery). this study also presents a microbiological study of periimplantitis conducted by the barcelona school of dentistry that determined that the antibiotic therapy proven to be most efficacious in the antibiogram was the association of amoxycillin and clavulanic acid.

TI  == rate of cultivable subgingival periodontopathogenic bacteria in chronic periodontitis.
AB  == although microbiological studies have identified more than 400 bacterial species  in periodontal pockets, only a limited number have been implicated as periodontal pathogens. the purpose of this study was to investigate the incidence of cultivable subgingival periodontopathogenic bacteria in chronic periodontitis. bacterial samples were collected with sterile paper points from the deepest periodontal pockets ((5 mm) of 203 patients: 92 males and 111 females, aged 35-55 years. the samples were cultured under anaerobic and capnophilic conditions using selective and non-selective media. isolates were characterized to species level by conventional biochemical tests and a commercial rapid test system. the isolates were actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (26.8%), porphyromonas gingivalis (21.9%), capnocytophaga sputigena (16.7%), eikenella corrodens (13.2%), prevotella intermedia (10.5 %), prevotella disiens (3.1%), peptostreptococcus micros (2.9%), capnocytophaga gingivalis (2.2%), prevotella corporis (1.8%), peptostreptococcus magnus (1.3%) and fusobacterium nucleatum (0.4%). no periodontopathogenic bacterial growth was observed in 14 of the samples (6.2%). the number of samples associated with monobacterial growth and polybacterial growth were 74.9% and 18.2% respectively. it is concluded that the  bacterial composition associated with a number of patients' samples is quite complex, and that some of cultivable anaerobic and capnophilic bacteria act as periodontal pathogens in chronic periodontitis.

TI  == clinical and microbiological changes associated with the use of combined antimicrobial therapies to treat "refractory" periodontitis.
AB  == background: the present investigation examined clinical and microbial changes after a combined aggressive antimicrobial therapy in subjects identified as "refractory" to conventional periodontal therapy. method: fourteen subjects were  identified as "refractory" based on full-mouth mean attachment loss and/or >3 sites with attachment loss > or =3 mm following scaling and root planing (srp), periodontal surgery and systemic antibiotics. after baseline monitoring, subjects received srp, locally delivered tetracycline at pockets > or =4 mm, systemically  administered amoxicillin (500 mg, t.i.d. for 14 days)+metronidazole (250 mg, t.i.d. for 14 days) and professional removal of supragingival plaque weekly for 3 months. subjects were monitored clinically every 3 months post-therapy for 2 years. subgingival plaque samples were taken at the same time points from the mesial aspect of each tooth and the levels of 40 subgingival taxa were determined using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. mean levels of each species were averaged within a subject at each visit. significance of changes in clinical and  microbiological parameters over time were evaluated using the friedman or wilcoxon signed ranks test. results: on average, subjects showed significant improvements in all clinical parameters after therapy. mean (+/-sem) full-mouth pocket depth reduction was 0.83+/-0.13 mm and mean attachment level "gain" was 0.44+/-0.12 at 24 months. clinical improvement was accompanied by major reductions in multiple subgingival species during the first 3 months of active therapy that were maintained for most species to the last monitoring visit. reductions occurred for three actinomyces species, "orange complex" species including campylobacter showae, eubacterium nodatum, three fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies, peptostreptococcus micros, prevotella intermedia as well as the "streptococcus milleri" group, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus constellatus and streptococcus intermedus. subjects differed in their response to therapy; six modest response subjects exhibited less attachment level gain and were characterized by reductions in the microbiota from baseline to 3 months, but re-growth of many species thereafter. conclusions: the combined antibacterial therapy was successful in controlling disease progression in 14 "refractory" periodontitis subjects for 2 years.

TI  == beta-lactamase production and antimicrobial susceptibility of subgingival bacteria from refractory periodontitis.
AB  == this study assessed the extent of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria in subgingival plaque samples obtained from 25 patients with refractory marginal periodontitis in the usa. beta-lactamase-positive isolates were characterized using commercial diagnostic kits and partial sequencing of the 16s rrna gene. the susceptibilities to different antimicrobial agents were tested and, in addition,  the isolates were screened for the presence of extended spectrum beta-lactamases  (esbls). beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were detected in 18 (72%) patients. the most prominent beta-lactamase-producing organisms belonged to the anaerobic genus prevotella. other enzyme-producing anaerobic strains were fusobacterium nucleatum, propionibacterium acnes and peptostreptococcus sp. facultative bacteria, such as burkholderia spp., ralstonia pickettii, capnocytophaga spp., bacillus spp., staphylococcus spp. and neisseria sp., were also detected among the enzyme-producers. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of ampicillin and  amoxicillin were in the range 1.5-256 micrograms/ml and 4-256 micrograms/ml, respectively, for the isolates of the prevotella species. all prevotella isolates were susceptible to amoxicillin/clavulanate and metronidazole, but they showed variable resistance to tetracyclines. two of the prevotella isolates had high mics of cefotaxime and ceftazidime. esbl activity was not detected in any of the  beta-lactamase-producing isolates by the etest method. thus, our study demonstrated a wide variety of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria that may play a  role in refractory periodontal disease.

TI  == subgingival microbiota of chilean patients with chronic periodontitis.
AB  == background: an association between race/ethnicity and the composition of the subgingival microbiota has been found in chronic periodontitis. a study was undertaken to determine the characteristics of the subgingival microbiota of chronic periodontitis in chileans residing in santiago. methods: twenty-six subjects (mean age 45 +/- 7 years) with chronic periodontitis, mean probing depth (pd) 2.63 +/- 0.5 mm, mean attachment level (al) 3.70 +/- 0.77 mm, and without a  history of periodontal therapy were selected. measurements of pd, al, bleeding on probing, and plaque accumulation were recorded at six sites per tooth. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of every tooth and evaluated for the presence, levels, and proportions of 40 bacterial taxa using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. the microbial data of the chileans were compared with data from 115 chronic periodontitis patients from boston, massachusetts. since several clinical and demographic parameters differed between the two populations, significance of differences for  each species was determined using analysis of covariance, adjusting for age, plaque level, mean pd, gender, and smoking status. results: each of the individual test species was present in at least 25 of the 26 subjects, and 12 subjects (46.1%) harbored all 40 test species. with the exception of prevotella intermedia, all test species colonized more than 75% of sites, and 25 species colonized > or = 90% of sites including the co-colonizing species of advanced periodontal lesions, termed the red complex, composed of the three species porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythensis (formerly bacteroides forsythus), and treponema denticola as well as fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies, campylobacter rectus, peptostreptococcus micros, and treponerma socranskii. sixteen of the 40 species differed significantly between chilean and  u.s. subjects. red, yellow, and other complexes were significantly higher in the  chileans, while the actinomyces were higher in the u.s. subjects. conclusions: the composition of the subgingival plaque differs among different subject populations. thus, care should be taken when extrapolating the findings of one study to different ethnic groups.

AB  == in six monkeys, 160 root canals were inoculated with a combination of four bacterial strains belonging to species streptococcus milleri, peptostreptococcus  anaerobius, prevotella oralis, and fusobacterium nucleatum. in two other monkeys, 24 root canals were inoculated with a five-strain combination consisting of these strains and a strain of enterococcus faecalis. all strains were previously isolated from an infected monkey root canal. after 8-12 months, survival of the strains was recorded bacteriologically, and the reaction in the periapical region was radiographed. from 180 of 184 root canals, one or more of the bacterial strains were reisolated. the two facultative strains were more frequently reisolated than the anaerobic strains. apical periodontitis was registered in the periapical region of more than 96% of root canals with reisolated bacteria but in none of those without reisolated bacteria. endodontic treatment was carried out in two sessions with an interval of 14 d without interappointment dressings, and  the effect was evaluated bacteriologically before and after each treatment. the chemo-mechanical treatment reduced significantly the number of strains and bacterial cells. the facultative bacteria were more resistant to the treatment than the anaerobic bacteria. the five-strain combination had a higher survival rate than the four-strain combination.

TI  == surveillance of susceptibility patterns in 1297 european and us anaerobic and capnophilic isolates to co-amoxiclav and five other antimicrobial agents.
AB  == in vitro susceptibility data were collected for co-amoxiclav and other antimicrobial agents against 1297 recent anaerobe isolates collected in europe and the usa. the co-amoxiclav (amoxicillin/clavulanic acid) mic(50/90)s (amoxicillin/clavulanic acid concentration in a ratio of 2:1, expressed in terms  of amoxicillin concentration in mg/l) were 0.5/4 for bacteroides fragilis, </=0.125/1 for prevotella species, </=0.125/0.25 for fusobacterium nucleatum, 0.5/1 for eikenella corrodens, 0.25/8 for peptostreptococcus anaerobius, </=0.125/0.5 for micromonas (peptostreptococcus) micros, </=0.25/0.5 for fingoldia (peptostreptococcus) magna, and </=0.125/0.125 for porphyromonas species. the co-amoxiclav susceptibility rate for b. fragilis was 94.6%, for p. anaerobius 84.3% and for all other species tested 100%. these data indicate that  co-amoxiclav remains an effective drug for the antimicrobial treatment and prophylaxis of many anaerobic infections. among the comparator drugs, metronidazole was very active against all bacterial species (>96% susceptible) except e. corrodens (mic(50/90) of >32/>64 mg/l), which is a capnophilic organism. imipenem was also highly active against all species (>98% susceptible). levofloxacin and clindamycin were the least potent agents tested, particularly against bacteroides, prevotella and peptostreptococcus (levofloxacin susceptibility rates: bacteroides 72.7%, prevotella 71.5%, f. magna 72.4%; clindamycin susceptibility rates: bacteroides 79.5%, prevotella 92.1%, f. magna 84.7%).

TI  == [a bacteriology analysis from infected root canals of human deciduous teeth]
AB  == objective: to provide a basis for therapy and prevention, the flora of infected root canals of human deciduous teeth was analyzed.methods: by immediate-enzyme method, the bacteria compositions of 22 cases with infected root canals of deciduous teeth, including 8 cases with acute periapical inflammation and 14 with chronic ones, were examined. results: among 240 strains bactera, 200 strains were obligate anaerobes, belonging to the genera peptostreptococcus, bacteriodes, veillonella, eubacterrum, propionibacterium, actinomyces and fusobacterium. bacteriodes and eusobacterium especially b. gingivalis and f. nucleatum have been more frequently isolated from root canals with acute periapical inflammation than that with chronic ones (p<0.05). in chronic cases, veillonella especially v. parvula, were more frequently isolated than acute inflammation. conclusion: periaplcal inflammation of deciduous teeth was mixed polymicrobial infections regardless of acute or chronic cases and anaerobic bacteria were dominated. b. gingivalis and f. nucleatum probably were related to acute periapical inflammation of deciduous teeth. the effect of v. parvula on chronic periapical innammation of deciduous teeth should not be neglected.

TI  == human beta-defensins 2 and 3 demonstrate strain-selective activity against oral microorganisms.
AB  == human beta-defensins 2 and 3 (hbd-2 and hbd-3) are inducible peptides present at  sites of infection in the oral cavity. a few studies have reported broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity for both peptides. however, no comprehensive study has thoroughly investigated their potential against oral pathogens. the purpose of this study was to test the effectiveness of hbd-2 and hbd-3 against a collection  of oral organisms (actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, peptostreptococcus micros, actinomyces naeslundii, actinomyces israelii, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans, candida tropicalis, candida parapsilosis, candida krusei, candida glabrata, and candida albicans). radial diffusion assays were used to test hbd-2 and hbd-3 activities against at least three strains of each species. there was significant variability in mics, which was strain specific rather than species specific. mics ranged from 3.9 to >250 micro g/ml for hbd-2 and from 1.4 to >250 micro g/ml for hbd-3. hbd-3 demonstrated greater antimicrobial activity and was effective against a broader array of organisms. overall, aerobes were 100% susceptible to hbd-2 and hbd-3, whereas only 21.4 and 50% of the anaerobes were susceptible to hbd-2 and hbd-3, respectively. hbd-2 and hbd-3 also demonstrated strain-specific activity against  the candida species evaluated. interestingly, an association between hbd-2 and hbd-3 activities was noted. this suggests that the two peptides may have similar  mechanisms yet utilize distinct pathways. the lack of activity against specific anaerobic strains and candida warrants further investigation of the potential resistance mechanisms of these organisms. finally, the significant variability between strains underlies the importance of testing multiple strains when evaluating activities of antimicrobial peptides.

TI  == microbiological examination of infected dental root canals.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to investigate the root canal microbiota of primary and secondary root-infected canals and the association of constituent species with specific endodontic signs and symptoms. methods: microbial samples were taken from 60 root canals, 41 with necrotic pulp tissues (primary infection) and 19 with failed endodontic treatment (secondary infection). strict anaerobic techniques were used for serial dilution, plating, incubation and identification. results: a total of 224 cultivable isolates were recovered belonging to 56 different bacterial species. individual root canals yielded a maximum of 10 bacterial species. of the bacterial isolates, 70% were either strict anaerobes or microphilic. the anaerobes most frequently isolated were: peptostreptococcus micros (35%), fusobacterium necrophorum (23.3%), fusobacterium nucleatum (11.7%), prevotella intermedia/nigrescens (16.7%), porphyromonas gingivalis (6.7%) and porphyromonas endodontalis (5%). the root canal microflora of untreated teeth with apical periodontitis was found to be mixed, comprising gram-negative and gram-positive and mostly anaerobic microorganisms and usually containing more than 3 species per canal. on the other hand, facultative anaerobic and gram-positive bacteria predominated in canals with failed endodontic treatment, which harbored 1-2 species per canal. suggested relationships were found between  anaerobes, especially gram-negatives, and the presence or history of pain, tenderness to percussion and swelling (p<0.05). in particular, associations were  found between: a) pain (n=29) and p. micros (p<0.01), p. intermedia/nigrescens and eubacterium spp. (both p<0.05); b) history of pain (n=31) and p. micros (p<0.01) porphyromonas and fusobacterium spp. (p<0.05); c) tenderness to percussion (n=29) and porphyromonas spp. (p<0.01), peptostreptococcus and fusobacterium spp. (p<0.001); d) swelling (n=20) and peptostreptococcus spp. (p<0.01), porphyromonas and enterococcus spp. (p<0.05); e) wet canals (n=33) and  porphyromonas and fusobacterium spp. (p<0.05); f) purulent exudate (n=20) and porphyromonas, peptostreptococcus and fusobacterium spp. (p<0.05); previous endodontic treatment and enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus spp., p. micros, f. necrophorum (p<0.05). conclusions: our findings indicate potential complex interactions of species resulting in characteristic clinical pictures which cannot be achieved by individual species alone. they also indicate that the microbiota of primary infected canals with apical periodontitis differs in number and in species from the secondary infected canals by using the culture technique.

TI  == clinical presentation and bacteriologic analysis of infected human bites in patients presenting to emergency departments.
AB  == previous studies of infected human bites have been limited by small numbers of patients and suboptimal microbiologic methodology. we conducted a multicenter prospective study of 50 patients with infected human bites. seventy percent of the patients and assailants were young adult men. fifty-six percent of injuries were clenched-fist injuries and 44% were occlusional bites. most injuries were to the hands. fifty-four percent of patients were hospitalized. the median number of isolates per wound culture was 4 (3 aerobes and 1 anaerobe); aerobes and anaerobes were isolated from 54% of wounds, aerobes alone were isolated from 44%, and anaerobes alone were isolated from 2%. isolates included streptococcus anginosus (52%), staphylococcus aureus (30%), eikenella corrodens (30%), fusobacterium nucleatum (32%), and prevotella melaninogenica (22%). candida species were found in 8%. fusobacterium, peptostreptococcus, and candida species  were isolated more frequently from occlusional bites than from clenched-fist injuries. many strains of prevotella and s. aureus were beta-lactamase producers. amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and moxifloxacin demonstrated excellent in vitro activity against common isolates.

TI  == fusobacterial brain abscess: a review of five cases and an analysis of possible pathogenesis.
AB  == object: the cases of five patients with fusobacterial brain abscess are presented. the authors discuss their attempt to determine the pathogenesis. methods: the clinical and microbiological features of five cases of fusobacterial brain abscess are reviewed. isolates of 2031 fusobacterium spp. and other anaerobes collected (1989-2002) at our institution were analyzed and compared for incidences and isolation sources. the findings were correlated with extensive literature on the subject. the five patients were men between 45 and 74 years of  age. all experienced an insidious onset of the disease and probable hematogenous  seeding of the organism(s). one patient had a monomicrobic fusobacterium necrophorum abscess, whereas the others had polymicrobic f. nucleatum abscesses.  despite surgery and a regimen of antibiotic medications and dexamethasone, three  patients experienced a paradoxical deterioration 3 days postoperatively that necessitated reevacuation of the lesion. the evacuants observed at that time contained numerous leukocytes but no microorganisms, suggesting intensified inflammation as the likely cause of deterioration. this explanation is supported  by literature that fusobacteria strongly activate neutrophils. an analysis of the 2031 anaerobes from blood, wounds, and abscesses showed the considerable virulence of fusobacterium spp., which were able to enter and/or sustain themselves in the blood circulation. this pattern was similar to that of clostridium spp., but different from those of peptostreptococcus spp., bacteroides spp., and prevotella spp., which were less invasive but more abundant. conclusions: some fusobacterial brain abscesses may be associated with  a paradoxical postoperative deterioration, which is probably due to intensified inflammation following treatment. the blood-borne dissemination and invasive behavior of fusobacteria likely initiate such a brain abscess, and further seeding of other synergic bacteria leads to a polymicrobic abscess.

TI  == antibiotic resistance of pathogenic bacteria from odontogenic infections in taiwan.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to evaluate the susceptibility of facultative and anaerobic odontogenic infectious flora to various antibiotics. we assessed 178 bacterial strains isolated from 74 patients with odontogenic infections. the e-test was used to determine susceptibility. the microbial flora was predominantly facultative gram-positive organisms and anaerobic gram-negative bacilli. the results of antimicrobial susceptibility test showed that ampicillin  resistance was found with a very high level of minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) in approximately one third of fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia, peptostreptococcus micros, and eikenella corrodens isolates (mic > or = 8 microg/ml). greater activity was generally noted with amoxicillin than with ampicillin, but even beta-lactamase inhibitor incorporated amoxicillin showed resistance in more than 10% of all groups except viridans group streptococci and  porphyromonas gingivalis. tetracycline and erythromycin were considerably less active against the majority of the tested bacterial strains, while minocycline and doxycycline exerted strong antimicrobial activity and could inhibit strains grown at a very low concentration. among all the tested antibiotics, travofloxacin appears to be a promising drug expressing the highest activities (mic90 < or = 1 microg/ml), and was regarded as a potent bactericidal drug in odontogenic infections.

TI  == positive and negative bacterial associations involving dialister pneumosintes in  primary endodontic infections.
AB  == dialister pneumosintes is an anaerobic gram-negative rod that has been recently implicated as a candidate endodontic pathogen. in this study, samples taken from  abscessed teeth and infected root canals associated with asymptomatic or symptomatic periradicular lesions were examined for the occurrence of bacterial associations involving d. pneumosintes. dna was extracted from the samples, and the presence of d. pneumosintes and 16 other bacterial species was determined by  means of species-specific nested polymerase chain reaction. positive and negative associations involving d. pneumosintes were investigated by computing the odds ratio of d. pneumosintes being found in a sample from endodontic infection in co-infection with one of the other target species. the association between the pairs containing d. pneumosintes and the occurrence of pain also was evaluated. d. pneumosintes was always detected in mixed infections with at least two of the  other target species. d. pneumosintes was positively associated with treponema denticola, porphyromonas endodontalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus micros, campylobacter rectus, prevotella intermedia, t. pectinovorum, and t. vincentii. negative associations were observed with bacteroides forsythus, p. gingivalis, and actinomyces israelii. no pair containing d. pneumosintes was found to be significantly associated with symptomatic cases (p > 0.01). the findings of this study lend considerable support to the notion of d. pneumosintes being an important endodontic pathogen,  usually in a mixed infection. positive associations of this species with other highly prevalent species, such as t. denticola and p. endodontalis, suggest that  bacterial synergism can occur and thereby play an important role in the pathogenesis of different forms of periradicular lesions.

TI  == effect of smoking and periodontal treatment on the subgingival microflora.
AB  == background: the effect of smoking on the prevalence of periodontal pathogens after periodontal treatment is still not clear. some studies found no effect of the smoking status on the prevalence of periodontal pathogens after therapy, whereas others did. the aim of this retrospective study was to investigate the influence of smoking on the treatment of periodontitis and the composition of the subgingival microflora. method: the study included 59 periodontitis patients (mean age 41.5 years): 30 smokers and 29 nonsmokers. the treatment consisted of initial periodontal therapy and, if necessary, surgery and/or antibiotics. clinical and microbiological data were obtained before and after treatment at the deepest site in each quadrant. a pooled sample was analysed for the presence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), prevotalla intermedia (pi), bacteroides forsythus (bf), fusobacterium nucleatum (fn) and peptostreptococcus micros (pm). results: for smokers and nonsmokers a significant improvement of the clinical condition was found after treatment. a decrease could be assessed for bleeding on probing (smokers: 0.46; nonsmokers: 0.52) and probing pocket depth (ppd) (smokers: 1.64 mm; nonsmokers: 2.09 mm). furthermore, both groups showed gain of attachment (smokers: 0.68 mm; nonsmokers: 1.46 mm). no significant difference in bleeding on probing and ppd reduction was  found between smokers and nonsmokers. in contrast, nonsmokers showed significantly more gain of attachment than smokers. the microbiological results revealed no differences in the prevalence of the various bacteria between smokers and nonsmokers before treatment. after treatment in nonsmokers, a significant decrease was found in the prevalence of aa (11-3), pg (17-7), pi (27-11), bf (27-11), fn (28-20) and pm (27-17). in smokers, a significant decrease could be shown only for the prevalence of pg (15-5). conclusions: nonsmokers showed more gain of attachment and a greater decrease in the prevalence of periodontal bacteria as compared to smokers. the phenomenon that among smokers, more patients remain culture positive for periodontal pathogens after therapy, may contribute to the often observed unfavourable treatment results in smoker periodontitis patients.

TI  == additive antimicrobial activity of calcium hydroxide and chlorhexidine on common  endodontic bacterial pathogens.
AB  == it is an established procedure to use calcium hydroxide [ca(oh)2] as a therapeutic component to achieve sterilization of infected root canals. unfortunately, some bacterial species are relatively resistant to ca(oh)2 and are therefore associated with treatment failures. the objective of this study was to  identify combinations of substances that improve antimicrobial activity. ca(oh)2  was used as a suspension or as a component of gutta-percha points. efficacy of killing was compared for (a) ca(oh)2 suspension alone; (b) zinc oxide (zno) points alone; (c) ca(oh)2 suspension combined with zno points; (d) ca(oh)2 suspension combined with zno/chlorhexidine points; and (e) ca(oh)2 points combined with zno/chlorhexidine points. common endodontopathogenic bacterial species (enterococcus faecalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus micros, porphyromonas gingivalis, streptococcus intermedius) in pure cultures served as target organisms. in the in vitro assay, the antibacterial substances and approximately 10(7) colony forming units of test bacteria were co-incubated in diluted human serum under growth conditions appropriate for the single bacterial species. samples were taken on days 0, 1, 2, 4, 7, and 14 of incubation and viable counts determined. gram-negative bacteria were sufficiently killed by  ca(oh)2 alone. combinations with other agents did not improve the killing kinetics. for the inactivation of the gram-positive bacteria p. micros and s. intermedius, a combination of ca(oh)2 and zno/chlorhexidine, killed the bacteria  faster than ca(oh)2 alone. for e. faecalis, combining ca(oh)2 suspension with zno/chlorhexidine points lead to a faster decrease in the overall number of viable bacteria, but no test conditions lead to the complete loss of culture viability. the results of this study support the use of a combination of ca(oh)2  and chlorhexidine for faster eradication of p. micros and s. intermedius from infected root canals.

AB  == the incidence of infection following arterial reconstruction using synthetic graft materials varies from less than 1 to 5%. one of three mechanisms is thought to be responsible: 1. intraoperative contamination, 2. extension from adjacent infected or colonized tissue, or 3. hematogenous or lymphogenous seeding. we present ultrastructural data of a patient with a polymicrobial graft infection due to a prostheto-enteric fistula 16 years after reconstruction of an aortobifemoral graft. the polymer surface showed signs of biodegradation and was  completely covered with a layer of plasma proteins. disrupted fibroblasts on the  intersegmental graft surface were surrounded by bundles of collagen. gram-negative rods and grampositive cocci were embedded in an extracellular eps matrix. bacterial culture confirmed growth of eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium  nucleatum and peptostreptococcus species. fibrin and granulation tissue from the  neoadventitia started to mark off the inflammatory process. transmission electron microscopy is a valuable tool for the investigation of alloplastic arterial devices. after 16 years of implantation the graft shows different signs of biodegradation.

AB  == gatifloxacin (bristol-myers squibb) and moxifloxacin (bayer) are new methoxyfluoroquinolones with broad-spectrum activity against aerobic and anaerobic pathogens of the respiratory tract. in this investigation, we analyzed  the bactericidal activity in serum over time of these antimicrobials against three aerobic (streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, and staphylococcus aureus) and four anaerobic (peptostreptococcus micros, peptostreptococcus magnus, fusobacterium nucleatum, and prevotella melaninogenica) bacteria associated with respiratory tract infections. serum samples were obtained from 11 healthy male subjects following a single 400-mg oral dose of gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin. these samples were collected prior to and at 2, 6, 12, and 24 h after the dose of each drug. gatifloxacin exhibited bactericidal activity for a median of 12 h against streptococcus pneumoniae (mic  = 0.5 micro g/ml), peptostreptococcus micros (mic = 0.25 micro g/ml), and f. nucleatum (mic = 0.5 micro g/ml) and 24 h against h. influenzae (mic = 0.03 micro g/ml), staphylococcus aureus (mic = 0.125 micro g/ml), peptostreptococcus magnus  (mic = 0.125 micro g/ml), and prevotella melaninogenica (mic = 0.5 micro g/ml). moxifloxacin exhibited bactericidal activity for a median of 24 h against streptococcus pneumoniae (mic = 0.125 micro g/ml), h. influenzae (mic = 0.015 micro g/ml), staphylococcus aureus (mic = 0.06 micro g/ml), f. nucleatum (mic = 0.5 micro g/ml), prevotella melaninogenica (mic =0.5 micro g/ml), peptostreptococcus magnus (mic = 0.125 micro g/ml), and peptostreptococcus micros (mic = 0.25 micro g/ml). the results from this pharmacodynamic study suggest that these fluoroquinolones would have prolonged killing activity against these organisms in vivo and may have clinical utility in the treatment of mixed aerobic-anaerobic respiratory tract infections.

AB  == the aim of the present investigation was to examine the outer-surface microbiota  of the prosthetic connector of frialit-2 implants, and to compare the microbial findings with the peri-implant parameters 2 years after functional loading. in 16 implant-treated patients (55.8 +/- 9.5 years) the outer-surface micro-organisms of the prosthetic connectors were determined in 32 frialit-2 implants. the functional loading time of the prosthetic suprastructures was 24.1 +/- 13.8 months on average. after removal of the implant-supported restoration, microbial  samples were obtained from the outer-surfaces of the frialit-2 prosthetic connector. the microbial plaque samples were specified on cdc-blood agar as percentages of the total cultivable flora. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was semiquantitively determined on tsbv-agar in cfu/ml. the microbial plaque samples were dominated by actinomyces israelii (68.8%), eubacterium lentum (56.3%) and veillonella parvula (43.8%) with proportions ranking between 3.9% (v. parvula) and 11.1% (a. israelii). the most frequently detected gram-negative microorganisms were fusobacterium nucleatum (87.5%), porphyromonas gingivalis (81.3%), and peptostreptococcus micros (68.8%) with enhanced proportions for p. gingivalis (11.4%) and p. micros (11.4%). no statistical significant correlation  could be established between the microbiota present on the outer-surfaces of the  f2-connector and the peri-implant parameters examined. the outer-surface microflora recovered from the implanto-prosthetic-connector of frialit-2 implants reveals a colonization with gram-positive bacteria and potentially harmful gram-negative micro-organisms that were frequently detected, but present at low levels. after 2 years of restorative loading, the outer-surface microbial colonization is compatible with peri-implant soft tissue health.

TI  == porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus and other putative periodontal pathogens in subjects with and without periodontal destruction.
AB  == background and aims: bacteria play an essential role in the pathogenesis of destructive periodontal disease. it has been suggested that not all bacteria associated with periodontitis may be normal inhabitants of a periodontally healthy dentition. in particular, porphyromonas gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans have been isolated infrequently from subjects without periodontitis. the aim of the present study was to compare prevalence and proportions of a number of periodontal bacteria in periodontitis patients and control subjects. material and methods: in all, 116 consecutive subjects diagnosed with moderate to severe periodontitis (mean age 42.4) and 94 subjects without radiographic evidence of alveolar bone loss (mean age 40.4) were recruited for the study. the gingival condition in the control group varied between gingival health and various degrees of gingivitis. in patients, the deepest pocket in each quadrant was selected for microbiological sampling. in control subjects all mesial and distal sites of all first molars were selected for sampling. all paper points from a patient were pooled and processed for anaerobic cultivation within 6 h after sampling. clinical variables of sampled sites included bleeding index, probing pocket depth and clinical attachment level. results: a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum and peptostreptococcus micros were significantly more often prevalent in patients than in controls. the highest odds ratios were found for p. gingivalis and b. forsythus (12.3 and 10.4 resp.). other odds ratios varied from 3.1 to 7.7 for a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. micros, respectively. absolute numbers of target bacteria were all higher in patients, but only the mean percentage of b. forsythus was significantly higher in patients in comparison to controls (p < 0.001). conclusions: a. actinomycetemcomitans, p.  gingivalis, p. intermedia, b. forsythus, f. nucleatum and p. micros are all significant markers for destructive periodontal disease in adult subjects. based  on calculated odds ratios, b. forsythus and p. gingivalis are the strongest bacterial markers for this disease and are infrequently cultured from subjects without periodontal bone loss.

TI  == antibacterial activity of moxifloxacin against periodontal anaerobic pathogens involved in systemic infections.
AB  == the in vitro activity of moxifloxacin was compared with that of penicillin g, amoxycillin/clavulanate, cefoxitin, erythromycin, clindamycin and metronidazole against 158 isolates associated with periodontal infections. mic(50)/mic(90) values of moxifloxacin were respectively 0.06/0.5 mg/l for porphyromonas gingivalis (35), for prevotella spp. (28) and actinomyces spp. (35), 0.12/0.25 mg/l for fusobacterium nucleatum (20) and 0.06/0.12 mg/l for peptostreptococcus spp. (30). the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) range of moxifloxacin for bacteroides forsythus (6) and campylobacter rectus (4) was 0.06-0.12 mg/l. the minimum bactericidal concentrations were equal to or 2-4 times the mic values. moxifloxacin produced a bactericidal effect at 8 h. our results show that moxifloxacin has good antibacterial activity against periodontal pathogens comparable with that of cefoxitin and amoxycillin/clavulanate, and better than that of clindamycin, metronidazole and penicillin.

AB  == the activity of faropenem, a new oral penem, was tested against 579 strains of anaerobic bacteria by using the nccls-approved reference method. drugs tested included amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefoxitin, clindamycin, faropenem, imipenem, and metronidazole. of the 176 strains of bacteroides fragilis group isolates tested, two isolates had faropenem mics of 64 micro g/ml and imipenem mics of >32 micro g/ml. faropenem had an mic of 16 micro g/ml for an additional isolate of b. fragilis; this strain was sensitive to imipenem (mic of 1 micro g/ml). both faropenem and imipenem had mics of < or=4 micro g/ml for all isolates of bacteroides capillosus (10 isolates), bacteroides splanchnicus (13 isolates), bacteroides ureolyticus (11 isolates), bilophila wadsworthia (11 isolates), porphyromonas species (42 isolates), prevotella species (78 isolates), campylobacter species (25 isolates), sutterella wadsworthensis (11 isolates), fusobacterium nucleatum (19 isolates), fusobacterium mortiferum/varium (20 isolates), and other fusobacterium species (9 isolates). faropenem and imipenem had mics of 16 to 32 micro g/ml for two strains of clostridium difficile; the mics for all other strains of clostridium tested (69 isolates) were < or =4 micro g/ml. faropenem had mics of 8 and 16 micro g/ml, respectively, for two strains of peptostreptococcus anaerobius (mics of imipenem were 2 micro g/ml). mics were < or =4 micro g/ml for all other strains of gram-positive anaerobic cocci (53 isolates) and non-spore-forming gram-positive rods (28 isolates). other results were as expected and reported in previous studies. no metronidazole resistance was seen in gram-negative anaerobes other than s. wadsworthensis (18% resistant); 63% of gram-positive non-spore-forming rods were resistant. some degree of clindamycin resistance was seen in most of the groups tested.

TI  == mice lacking monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 have enhanced susceptibility to an interstitial polymicrobial infection due to impaired monocyte recruitment.
AB  == monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (mcp-1) is an important chemokine that induces monocyte recruitment in a number of different pathologies, including infection. to investigate the role of mcp-1 in protecting a host from a chronic interstitial polymicrobial infection, dental pulps of mcp-1(-/-) mice and controls were inoculated with six different oral pathogens. in this model the recruitment of leukocytes and the impact of a genetic deletion on the susceptibility to infection can be accurately assessed by measuring the progression of soft tissue  necrosis and osteolytic lesion formation. the absence of mcp-1 significantly impaired the recruitment of monocytes, which at later time points was threefold higher in the wild-type mice than in mcp-1(-/-) mice (p < 0.05). the consequence  was significantly enhanced rates of soft tissue necrosis and bone resorption (p < 0.05). we also determined that the mcp-1(-/-) mice were able to recruit polymorphonuclear leukocytes (pmns) to a similar or greater extent as controls and to produce equivalent levels of porphyromonas gingivalis-specific total immunoglobulin g (igg) and igg1. these results point to the importance of mcp-1 expression and monocyte recruitment in antibacterial defense and demonstrate that antibacterial defense is not due to an indirect effect on pmn recruitment or modulation of the adaptive immune response.

TI  == parotid salivary s-iga antibodies during experimental gingivitis in smokers and non-smokers.
AB  == persons who smoke display a less pronounced increase of gingival bleeding in the  experimental gingivitis model as compared with non-smokers. the aim of the present study was to investigate whether this could partly be explained by differences in levels of parotid total secretory iga (s-iga) or parotid s-iga reactive with selected oral microorganisms. parotid saliva samples were obtained  from 11 smoking and 14 non-smoking volunteers, at baseline, after 5 and 14 days of full mouth experimental gingivitis. output levels of total s-iga and of specific s-iga reactive with cell extracts from actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, actinomyces naeslundii, campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, peptostreptococcus micros, streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus mutans were determined in the samples by means of elisa. smokers and non-smokers were found to have similar output levels (microg/min) of total s-iga, and the values did not significantly change during the experimental gingivitis trial. parotid salivary outputs (units/min) of the bacteria-specific s-iga at baseline and at days 5 and 14, were not different between smokers and non-smokers; no changes were observed during the experimental gingivitis trial. the present observations indicate that total s-iga and bacteria-specific s-iga in saliva are not main factors that can explain the less pronounced increase of gingival bleeding in the experimental gingivitis model in smokers as compared with non-smokers.

TI  == treatment of papillon-lefevre syndrome periodontitis.
AB  == background, aims: conventional mechanical treatment of papillon-lefevre syndrome  periodontitis has a poor prognosis. this report describes an effective antimicrobial treatment of rapidly progressing periodontitis in an 11-year old girl having papillon-lefevre syndrome. method: clinical examination included conventional periodontal measurements and radiographic analysis. occurrence of major suspected periodontopathic bacteria was determined by selective and non-selective culture and by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) identification. presence of cytomegalovirus and epstein-barr type 1 virus was determined by a nested-pcr detection method. therapy included scaling and root planing, oral hygiene instruction, and systemic amoxicillin-metronidazole therapy (250 mg of each/3 times daily/10 days) which, based on follow-up microbiological testing, was repeated after 4 months. supportive periodontal therapy took place at 2 visits during a 16-month period. results: at baseline, 10 of 22 available teeth demonstrated severe periodontal breakdown. at 16 months, probing and radiographic measurements revealed no teeth with additional attachment loss, and several teeth exhibited significant reduction in gingivitis and pocket depth, increase in radiographic alveolar bone height and clinical attachment level, and radiographic evidence of crestal lamina dura. baseline subgingival microbiota included actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (3.4% of total isolates), prevotella nigrescens (16.4%), fusobacteriumnucleatum (14.3%) and peptostreptococcus micros  (10.6%), as well as cytomegalovirus and epstein-barr type 1 virus. at termination of the study, culture and pcr examinations showed absence of a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. micros and herpesviruses, and p. nigrescens and f.nucleatum each comprised less than 0.1 % of subgingival isolates. conclusion: this study suggests that controlling the periodontopathic microbiota by appropriate antibiotic and conventional periodontal therapy can arrest papillon-lefevre syndrome periodontitis.

TI  == subgingival microbiota of indigenous indians of central america.
AB  == objective: to define the subgingival microbial profiles of adult subjects from a  previously identified rural community of indigenous indians in guatemala, central america. materials and methods: a full-mouth periodontal examination was performed in 114 adult subjects from 45 families. plaque samples were collected from both deep and shallow periodontal pockets and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization was employed to identify 17 species previously associated with periodontitis or health. results: plaque deposits and gingivitis were universal and widespread, and periodontal pocketing > or =5 mm was highly prevalent (84% of subjects). streptococcus sanguis, actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2 and fusobacterium nucleatum were significantly more prevalent in shallow sites. at the subject level, actinomyces naeslundii and peptostreptococcus micros were significantly more prevalent in periodontally-healthy subjects. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was not detected in any sample. conclusion: there was no association between periodontal disease status and presence of suspected periodontal pathogens. these latter results conflict somewhat with those from treated populations. however, in this population where extensive plaque deposits  and gingivitis are universal, the presence of putative pathogens may be more reflective of the local environment.

TI  == maternal periodontitis and prematurity. part ii: maternal infection and fetal exposure.
AB  == clinical data from the first 812 deliveries from a cohort study of pregnant mothers entitled oral conditions and pregnancy (ocap) demonstrate that both antepartum maternal periodontal disease and incidence/progression of periodontal  disease are associated with preterm birth and growth restriction after adjusting  for traditional obstetric risk factors. in the current study we present measures  of maternal periodontal infection using whole chromosomal dna probes to identify  15 periodontal organisms within maternal periodontal plaque sampled at delivery.  in addition, maternal postpartum igg antibody and fetal exposure, as indexed by fetal cord blood igm level to these 15 maternal oral pathogens, was measured by whole bacterial immunoblots. the potential role of maternal infection with specific organisms within 2 bacterial complexes most often associated with periodontitis, conventionally termed "orange" (campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus micros, prevotella nigrescens, and prevotella intermedia) and "red" (porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus, and treponema denticola) complexes, respectively, to prematurity was investigated by relating the presence of oral infection, maternal igg, and fetal  cord igm, comparing full-term to preterm (gestational age < 37 weeks). the prevalence of 8 periodontal pathogens was similar among term and preterm mothers  at postpartum. there was a 2.9-fold higher prevalence of igm seropositivity for one or more organisms of the orange or red complex among preterm babies, as compared to term babies (19.9% versus 6.9%, respectively, p = 0.0015, chi square). specifically, the prevalence of positive fetal igm to c. rectus was significantly higher for preterm as compared to full-term neonates (20.0% versus  6.3%, p = 0.0002, as well as p. intermedia (8.8% versus 1.1%, p = 0.0003). a lack of maternal igg antibody to organisms of the red complex was associated with an increased rate of prematurity with an odds ratio (or) = 2.2; confidence interval  (ci) 1.48 to 3.79), consistent with the concept that maternal antibody protects the fetus from exposure and resultant prematurity. the highest rate of prematurity (66.7%) was observed among those mothers without a protective red complex igg response coupled with a fetal igm response to orange complex microbes (combined or 10.3; p < 0.0001). these data support the concept that maternal periodontal infection in the absence of a protective maternal antibody response is associated with systemic dissemination of oral organisms that translocate to the fetus resulting in prematurity. the high prevalence of elevated fetal igm to  c. rectus among premature infants raises the possibility that this specific maternal oral pathogen may serve as a primary fetal infectious agent eliciting prematurity.

TI  == periodontal bacteria in rabbit mandibular and maxillary abscesses.
AB  == despite the high incidence of odontogenic abscesses in pet rabbits, published data on the bacteriology of these infections are lacking, and clinical cultures are often ambiguous, making antibiotic choices difficult. in order to define the  bacteriology of these infections, 12 rabbit mandibular and maxillary abscesses were cultured aerobically and anaerobically. all specimens yielded pathogenic bacteria, including fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella heparinolytica, prevotella spp., peptostreptococcus micros, streptococcus milleri group, actinomyces israelii, and arcanobacterium haemolyticum. these organisms are consistent with the characterized bacteriology of periodontal disease in human and other mammalian studies. the isolates were tested against 10 antimicrobial agents commonly used to treat rabbits; 100% of the strains tested were susceptible to clindamycin, 96% were susceptible to penicillin and ceftriaxone, 54% were susceptible to ciprofloxacin, and only 7% were susceptible to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.

AB  == the study on the sensitiveness of slow-growing anaerobes bacteria to antibiotics  is delicate when you consider the technical motives that make it difficult to transpose the standard methods frequently used in microbiological laboratories. the three main methods used to determine susceptibility to antibiotics are: disk-diffusion test, antibiotics containing microdilution plates and atb ana (biomerieux). the aim of this study is to compare the effectiveness of each of these methods on severe anaerobes bacteria isolated in sub-gingival flora of patients suffering from developing periodontitis (rapidly progressive periodontitis, refractory periodontitis, active stage of adult chronic periodontitis). the observed bacteria are: porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, peptostreptococcus micros. antibiotics used are: ampicilline, amoxicilline, tetracycline, erythromycine, metronidazole. the comparison of the minimal inhibitory concentrations (m.i.c) of each of these methods has permitted to show a strict correlation in the results observed with these three methods, if only the growth  of the severe anaerobes bacteria on agar medium does not exceed 72 hours.

TI  == supragingival and subgingival microbiota of adult patients with down's syndrome.  changes after periodontal treatment.
AB  == in this longitudinal study, five adult down's syndrome patients with periodontitis were placed on a frequent recall visit schedule (every 6 weeks) after treatment, in order to investigate: 1) the microbiological status, both supragingivally and subgingivally, and the changes that occurred after treatment  and 2) the effect of frequent professional supragingival plaque control on the subgingival microbiota and clinical variables in these patients. the clinical variables recorded were probing pocket depth, probing attachment level, bleeding  on probing and presence of plaque (full mouth, six surfaces per tooth). microbiological examination was performed separately for supragingival and subgingival samples from the same site for 14 species, using whole genomic dna probes and the "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridization technique. the findings indicate that, although a reduction of periodontal indices was noticed, plaque levels remained high (60%) even at the end of the experimental period. periodontal pathogens including porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were frequently detected both supragingivally and subgingivally (>30%). the presence of a species supragingivally and the presence at the same time points subgingivally were correlated. this finding suggested that supragingival plaque acts as a reservoir  for reinfection of treated sites. a reduction of the percentages of detection of  these species was noticed 1 month after an oral hygiene period as well as at 3 and 6 months after treatment. inadequate oral hygiene as performed by these patients probably affected supragingival, and consequently subgingival, plaque composition.

TI  == absence of a specific subgingival microflora in adults with down's syndrome.
AB  == background: periodontal disease in down's syndrome (ds) is generally characterized by a high degree of bone loss. bone loss of 5 mm or more is observed in 70% of these subjects. among ds subjects, considerable differences in disease progression occur. so far, no studies have been conducted in which specific properties of the subgingival microflora have been related to the condition observed. aims: to investigate (1) the subgingival microflora in ds subjects and other mentally retarded (control) individuals which were matched to  the utmost and (2) to investigate the subgingival microflora of a "low-risk" and  a " high-risk" group formed in ds subjects. material and methods: 17 ds subjects  and 17 control subjects were matched with respect to age, plaque level and bleeding on probing. in addition, the ds group was divided in a "low-risk" group  (0-2 teeth lost due to periodontal disease n=6) and a "high-risk"group (6-13 teeth lost due to periodontal disease n=11). prevalence and proportions of the putative periodontal pathogens actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, bacteroides forsythus, peptostreptococcus micros, fusobacterium nucleatum and campylobacter rectus in the subgingival plaque were determined using anaerobic culture techniques. no differences in the prevalence of distinct suspected periodontopathic bacteria and bacterial subgingival composition between the ds group and the control group could be established. also no differences in the prevalence of the seven investigated microbial species between the "low-risk" and the "high-risk" group were observed. conclusions: because of the lack of differences in microflora between the ds group and the control group, a specific effect of the microbiological composition in the periodontal status of subjects with ds can be  excluded in this population. host factors constitute the more likely explanation  of the differences observed in ds.

AB  == background/aim: the purpose of the present investigation was to determine the effect of self-performed supragingival plaque removal using either manual (crest  complete) or power (braun 3d plaque remover) toothbrushing on supra and subgingival plaque composition. methods: 47 periodontal maintenance subjects completed this single-blind 6 month longitudinal study. at baseline, samples of supra and separately subgingival plaque were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in each subject using sterile curettes and individually analyzed for their  content of 18 bacterial taxa using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. after random assignment to groups receiving either a manual (n=25) or power toothbrush  (n=22), subjects received instruction in oral hygiene and used their assigned toothbrush 2x daily for 6 months. clinical monitoring and microbiological sampling were repeated at 3 and 6 months. significant differences in microbiological measures over time were sought using the quade test and between brushing groups at each time point using the mann-whitney test. results: mean total counts were significantly reduced for supra- and subgingival plaque samples in the manual group and subgingival samples in the powered brushing group. actinomyces naeslundii and actinomyces israelii/gerencseriae were the most numerous organisms detected at baseline and showed the greatest reductions in counts in both brushing groups. streptococcus constellatus/intermedius was significantly reduced in both groups, while streptococcus mitis/oralis/sanguis was significantly reduced in the manual toothbrushing group. mean counts of species were more markedly altered in subgingival plaque. major reductions occurred in both groups for a. naeslundii, a. israelii/gerencseriae, peptostreptococcus micros, veillonella parvula, prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, s. mitis/oralis/sanguis and s. constellatus/intermedius. all taxa examined were reduced in prevalence (% of sites colonized) in the subgingival plaque samples for both brushing groups. the reductions in prevalence were greater for a. naeslundii, s. constellatus/intermedius, v. parvula, a. israelii/gerencseriae, s. mitis/oralis/sanguis, p. micros, streptococcus mutans and p. intermedia/nigrescens. mean prevalence was decreased more for porphyromonas gingivalis, campylobacter rectus/showae, treponema denticola and bacteroides forsythus in supragingival plaque than subgingival plaque. conclusions: the major finding was the effect of supragingival plaque removal on the composition of the  subgingival microbiota. counts and prevalence of most taxa examined were markedly decreased in both toothbrushing groups. this reduction should translate to a decreased risk of periodontal disease initiation or recurrence. further, the decreased prevalence of periodontal pathogens in supragingival plaque lowers potential reservoirs of these species.

AB  == the aim of this study was to carry out a microbiological evaluation of sites with and without clinical evidence of moderate and severe periodontitis and their correlation with clinical parameters. a total of 52 disease sites and 10 healthy  sites were selected according to clinical criteria. the following clinical indexes were measured for all the sites: plaque index, gingival index, blood on probing, depth on probing and insertion level. samples of subgingival plaque were collected for culture and for differential counts of microbial morphotypes. in disease sites the most frequently isolated were: prevotella intermedia/nigrescens (65%), porphyromonas gingivalis (23%), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (23%), fusobacterium nucleatum (10%) and peptostreptococcus sp. (31%). the aerobic gram-positive microflora was predominant in healthy sites. significant differences were observed in microbial morphotypes between healthy and disease sites: cocci 18.71% and 78.90%, motile rods 46.12% and 16.70%, total spirochetes  26.48% and 2.80%, respectively. the presence of motile rods, spirochetes and p. intermedia/nigrescens were the parameters with most sensitivity to suspect periodontal disease. there were significant differences in the subgingival microflora between healthy and disease sites in patients with moderate and severe periodontitis.

AB  == the purpose of the study was to determine the effect of electron beam sterilization on gutta-percha cones (gpcs) at different times after sterilization. an agar diffusion test was used with -one aerobic bacterium (bacillus subtilis) and five oral anaerobic bacteria (fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus micros, porphyromonas gingivalis, propionibacterium acnes, and veillonella parvula). with each microorganism 30 agar plates were prepared, evenly distributed among three groups (group 1: unsterilized gpcs; groups 2 and 3: gpcs sterilized by electron beam irradiation 5 months and 5 yr before, respectively). one gpc of the selected group was placed in each plate. after incubation the area of inhibition was read on the agar plates. inhibition of growth was significantly different for the tested microorganisms. however no significant difference was observed between the sterilized and unsterilized gpcs. both the tested sterilized and unsterilized gpcs impair the growth of endodontic  pathogens, with no influence of the time elapsed since sterilization.

TI  == an in vitro evaluation of the antimicrobial efficacy of irrigants on biofilms of  root canal isolates.
AB  == aim: the bactericidal effect of four antimicrobial agents was investigated against single-species biofilms derived from a range of root canal isolates. methodology: single-species biofilms of prevotella intermedia, peptostreptococcus micros, streptococcus intermedius, fusobacterium nucleatum and enterococcus faecalis were generated on membrane filter discs and subjected to 15 min or 1 h incubation with 5 p.p.m. colloidal silver, 2.25% sodium hypochlorite (naocl), 0.2% chlorhexidine, 10% iodine or phosphate buffered saline (pbs) as a control. the antimicrobial activity of the agents was neutralized and the bacterial cells  were harvested from the discs by vortexing, serially diluted in reduced transport fluid, plated on fastidious anaerobe agar containing 5% horse blood, incubated anaerobically and colony-forming units calculated. results: iodine and naocl were more effective than chlorhexidine except against p. micros and p. intermedia where they were all 100% effective. iodine and naocl elicited a 100% kill after 1 h incubation for all strains used. however, after 15 min, they showed differing bactericidal effects depending on the strain. none of the agents were effective against f. nucleatum after 15 min but naocl, iodine and chlorhexidine were all effective after 1 h. colloidal silver was generally ineffective. conclusions: the effectiveness of a particular agent was dependent on the nature of the organism in the biofilm and on the contact time. naocl was generally the most effective agent tested, followed by iodine. however the clinical efficacy of these agents must be considered in light of the complex root canal anatomy and polymicrobial nature of root canal infections.

TI  == mutans streptococci in subgingival plaque of treated and untreated patients with  periodontitis.
AB  == background: the etiology of root caries is thought to be identical to coronal caries, though root caries seem to be more complicated because of the higher susceptibility of exposed roots (dentin) by periodontal therapy to demineralization than intact enamel. this implies that mutans streptococci are the most likely pathogens in the development of root caries. although it is known that both the numbers of mutans streptococci and the frequency of isolation in root caries lesions are negatively correlated with the distance from the gingival margin, the subgingival sulcus has not been considered a possible habitat for mutans streptococci. however, subgingival occurrence of mutans streptococci in both untreated and treated periodontal patients has not been documented well in the literature. objective: to investigate the presence and levels of mutans streptococci in the subgingival plaque of patients (n=154) in different stages of periodontal therapy. the subgingival sulcus may be a possible habitat for mutans  streptococci. this localisation of mutans streptococci may be of importance in the development of root caries after periodontal surgery. materials and methods:  in this cross-sectional study, subgingival plaque samples from 154 consecutive adult periodontitis patients were tested for presence and levels of mutans streptococci and putative periodontal pathogens by anaerobic cultures. these patients were divided into 4 groups based on their stage of periodontal treatment: (1) untreated patients; (2) patients after initial periodontal therapy only; (3) patients in the maintenance phase who not underwent periodontal surgery; (4) patients after periodontal surgery. results: the prevalence of mutans streptococci in the 4 study groups varied from 82% in untreated patients to 94% in maintenance patients. the mean proportion of mutans streptococci was 6.65% in maintenance patients versus 1.86% in untreated patients (p=0.005) and 2.51% in patients after scaling and root planing (p=0.041). conclusions: the subgingival area is a microbial habitat for mutans streptococci that may be of importance in the development of root caries in periodontitis patients.

TI  == untreated periodontal disease in indonesian adolescents. subgingival microbiota in relation to experienced progression of periodontitis.
AB  == background/aims: in an indonesian population deprived of regular dental care, the experienced progression of disease between baseline (1987) and follow-up (1994) was investigated in relation to the composition of the subgingival microbiota at  follow-up. at baseline the age ranged from 15 to 25 years. clinical and microbiological evaluation was completed in 158 of the 167 subjects available at  follow-up. methods: plaque index (pi), pocket depth (pd), bleeding on probing (bop), and attachment loss (al) were scored at the approximal surfaces of all teeth and subgingival calculus on the approximal surfaces of the ramfjord teeth only (number of sites with subgingival calculus: nsc). a pooled sample of the deepest pocket in each quadrant was evaluated using microbiological culture techniques. results: at baseline the mean values of the clinical parameters were  al=0.35 mm, pi=1.01, bop=0.80 pd=3.25 mm and nsc=6.04 and at follow-up al=0.75 mm, pi=1.16, bop=1.19, pd=3.34 mm and nsc=5.85. all parameters except pd and nsc  showed a statistically significant increase. at follow-up the prevalence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was 40%, of porphyromonas gingivalis 67%, of prevotella intermedia 66%, of fusobacterium nucleatum 79%, of bacteroides forsythus 16%, of campylobacter rectus 4%, and of p. micros 6%. no differences in clinical parameters were found between groups with or without these micro-organisms. in 129 subjects al of > or =2 mm at > or =1 site was found. logistic regression showed three significant odds-ratio's for experienced progressive periodontitis: plaque index (12.2), gender (3.4) and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (2.9). conclusions: the results of this retrospective study suggest that plaque is the most important parameter related to experienced disease progression, and that the presence of a. actinomycetemcomitans may be associated with increased chance of disease progression.

TI  == smoking affects the subgingival microflora in periodontitis.
AB  == background: tobacco smoking has been identified as one major risk factor for destructive periodontal disease. scaling and root planing have been shown to be less effective in smokers with periodontitis. the aim of the present study was to compare the subgingival microbial flora of treated and untreated smokers and non-smokers. methods: four independent adult patient groups with periodontitis were included in this investigation: 88 untreated smokers (u-s); 90 untreated non-smokers (u-ns); 119 treated non-smokers (t-ns); and 171 treated smokers (t-s). clinical variables included cumulative plaque index (cpi), probing depth (pd), clinical attachment level (cal), cumulative bleeding index (cbi), and cumulative suppuration index (csi). paper point samples from the deepest bleeding pocket in each quadrant of the dentition were analyzed for the presence and levels of 6 periodontal bacterial pathogens using anaerobic culture techniques. results: u-s showed a higher mean cumulative plaque index than u-ns (3.5 versus 2.7). mean pd and mean cal were higher in the t-s in comparison to the t-ns group (7.0 versus 6.6 mm and 5.6 versus 4.7 mm, respectively). microbiological characteristics of u-s were a higher prevalence of prevotella intermedia/nigrescens and higher mean levels of peptostreptococcus micros (pm) and fusobacterium nucleatum (fn). t-s patients were characterized by higher prevalence of bacteroides forsythus (bf), pm, and campylobacter rectus (cr) and higher mean levels of pm and fn. the mean percentage of b. forsythus tended to be higher in the t-s group than in the t-ns group (6.9% versus 5.6%). the relative risk to be infected with bf, pm, and cr was statistically higher in smokers (odds ratios: 1.9, 1.9, and 1.6, respectively). the chance to find > or =10% of bf, pm, and/or fn was 3.3 higher in smokers when a. actinomycetemcomitans and p gingivalis were absent. detection of > or =20% pm/fn in treated patients was strongly associated with smoking (odds ratio 13.8, p= 0.002). conclusions: smoking is a determining factor for the composition of the subgingival microflora in adult patients with periodontitis and may select for a specific cluster of periodontal pathogens, notably bf, pm, fn, and cr. on the basis of these observations, smoking, among other criteria, may be one parameter to use in deciding to treat refractory periodontitis in smokers with a systemic antibiotic  therapy directed against smoking-associated periodontal bacteria.

TI  == relationship of cigarette smoking to the subgingival microbiota.
AB  == background: the relationship of cigarette smoking to the composition of the subgingival microbiota is not clear. some studies indicated higher levels of certain species in smokers, while other studies failed to detect differences in the microbiota between subjects with different smoking histories. thus, the purpose of the present investigation was to examine the prevalence, proportions and levels of the subgingival species in adult subjects who were current, past or never smokers. method: 272 adult subjects ranging in age from 20-86 years with at least 20 teeth were recruited for study. smoking history was obtained using a questionnaire. clinical measures were taken at 6 sites per tooth at all teeth excluding third molars at a baseline visit. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial surface of all teeth excluding third molars in each subject at baseline and assayed individually for counts of 29 subgingival species using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. subjects were subset according to smoking history into never (n=124), past (n=98) and current smokers (n=50). uni-variate and multi-variate analyses were used to seek associations between smoking category and the counts, proportions and prevalence of subgingival species. results: greater differences were observed for the prevalence (% of sites colonized) of the test species in the 3 smoking groups than were observed for counts or proportions of total counts. members of the orange and red complexes including e. nodatum, f. nucleatum ss vincentii, p. intermedia, p. micros, p. nigrescens, b. forsythus, p. gingivalis and t. denticola were significantly more  prevalent in current smokers than in the other 2 groups. the difference in prevalence between smokers and non-smokers was due to greater colonization at sites with pocket depth <4 mm. stepwise multiple linear regression analysis indicated that combinations of the prevalence of 5 microbial species and pack years accounted for 44% of the variance for mean pocket depth (p<0.000001), while the prevalence of 3 microbial taxa along with age, pack years, current smoking and gender accounted for 31% of the variance in mean attachment level (p<0.000001). the difference in prevalence between current and never smokers of all members of the red complex and 8 of 12 members of the orange complex was significantly greater in the maxilla than in the mandible. conclusions: the major difference between the subgingival microbiota in subjects with different smoking  history was in the prevalence of species rather than counts or proportions. the greater extent of colonization in smokers appeared to be due to greater colonization at pocket depths <4 mm. differences in colonization patterns between current and never smokers were greater in the maxilla than in the mandible.

TI  == smoking and subgingival microflora in periodontal disease.
AB  == aim: the present investigation was undertaken to analyze the influence of smoking on the periodontal disease associated subgingival microflora. the population included 33 smokers and 31 non-smokers in the age range 36-86 years. methods: microbial samples were obtained from 4 sites per patient. the checker-board dna-dna hybridization technology was used for detection of the bacterial species  p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, p. nigrescens, b. forsythus, a. actinomycetemcomitans, f. nucleatum, t. denticola, p. micros, c. rectus, e. corrodens, s. noxia and s. intermedius. results: using score 1 as cutoff, contrasting colonized versus non-colonized patients, 8 out of 12 species were detected in > or = 90% of both smokers and non-smokers. using score 4 as cutoff,  contrasting heavily colonized patients versus non-colonized and less heavily colonized patients, the detection rates decreased in both smokers and non-smokers. no significant differences in detection rates were observed between  smokers and non-smokers. logistic regression analysis indicated that neither smoking, probing depth nor gingival bleeding influenced the occurrence of the species analyzed. the lack of a smoking exposure dose-response further supported  the indication of a limited influence of smoking. conclusion: smoking exerts little, if any, influence on the subgingival occurrence of several of the bacteria most commonly associated with periodontal disease.

TI  == early colonization of dental implants by putative periodontal pathogens in partially edentulous patients.
AB  == there is limited scientific information available on the early colonization of the peri-implant pockets in partially edentulous individuals. knowledge about this process is one step in better understanding the etiology and pathogenesis of peri-implantitis. in this study, the early colonization of the peri-implant pockets by putative periodontal pathogens was studied in 20 partially edentulous  individuals using anaerobic culture techniques. at baseline, the presence and levels of putative periodontal pathogens in the microflora of periodontal pockets and saliva were established. immediately after loading of the titanium implants and after 6 and 12 months the presence and levels of selected putative periodontal pathogens were determined in periodontal and peri-implant pockets. a  second aim was to detect bacterial contamination of the implant site and the inside of the implant. at baseline, the most frequently isolated species from the periodontal pockets were fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia and peptostreptococcus micros. bacteroides forsythus, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis were isolated from 9, 2 and 3  patients respectively. six months after placing of the bridges, the majority of the implant sites had detectable levels of most periodontal bacterial species with the exception of a. actinomycetemcomitans which could not be isolated from any of the peri-implant samples during the experimental period, although 2 patients had this organism at baseline. in 2 patients with detectable subgingival p. gingivalis at baseline this species was found after 12 months in the peri-implant sites. one of these patients lost 2 implants which was associated with a high proportion of p. gingivalis in the peri-implant pockets. a second patient developed 2 fistulas around 2 implants at 8 months and this event was also associated with the presence of p. gingivalis. it is concluded that proper periodontal infection control before installment of dental implants in partially  edentulous patients may prevent early bacterial complications.

TI  == interleukin-6 deficiency increases inflammatory bone destruction.
AB  == periapical bone destruction occurs as a consequence of pulpal infection. in previous studies, we showed that interleukin-1 (il-1) is the primary stimulator of bone destruction in this model. il-6 is a pleiotropic cytokine that is induced in these infections and has both pro- and anti-inflammatory activities. in the present study, we determined the role of il-6 in regulating il-1 expression and bone resorption. the first molars of il-6 knockouts (il-6(-/-)) and wild-type mice were subjected to surgical pulp exposure and infection with a mixture of four common pulpal pathogens, including prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus micros, and streptococcus intermedius. mice were killed after 21 days, and bone destruction and cytokine expression were determined. surprisingly, bone destruction was significantly increased in il-6(-/-) mice versus that in wild-type mice (by 30%; p < 0.001). in a second experiment, the effects of chronic (il-6(-/-)) il-6 deficiency and short-term il-6 deficiency induced by in vivo antibody neutralization were determined. both  il-6(-/-) (30%; p < 0.001) and anti-il-6 antibody-treated mice (40%; p < 0.05) exhibited increased periapical bone resorption, compared to wild-type controls. the increased bone resorption in il-6-deficient animals correlated with increases in osteoclast numbers, as well as with elevated expression of bone-resorptive cytokines il-1alpha and il-1beta, in periapical lesions and with decreased expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokine il-10. these data demonstrate that endogenous il-6 expression has significant anti-inflammatory effects in modulating infection-stimulated bone destruction in vivo.

TI  == two cases of diskitis attributable to anaerobic bacteria in children.
AB  == diskitis, an inflammation of the intervertebral disk, is generally attributable to staphylococcus aureus and rarely staphylococcus epidermidis, kingella kingae,  enterobacteriaciae, and streptococcus pneumoniae. in many cases, no bacterial growth is obtained from infected intervertebral discs. although anaerobic bacteria were recovered from adults with spondylodiscitis, these organisms were not reported before from children. the recovery of anaerobic bacteria in 2 children with diskitis is reported. patient 1. a 10-year-old male presented with  6 weeks of low back pain and 2 weeks of low-grade fever and abdominal pain. physical examination was normal except for tenderness to percussion over the spine between thoracic vertebra 11 and lumbar vertebra 2. the patient had a temperature of 104 degrees f. laboratory tests were within normal limits, except  for erythrocyte sedimentation rate (esr), which was 58 mm/hour. blood culture showed no growth. magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium contrast revealed minimal inflammatory changes in the 12th thoracic vertebra/first lumbar vertebra  disk. there was no other abnormality. a computed tomography (ct)-guided aspiration of the disk space yielded bloody material, which was sent for aerobic  and anaerobic cultures. gram stain showed numerous white blood cells and gram-positive cocci in chains. cultures for anaerobic bacteria yielded heavy growth of peptostreptococcus magnus, which was susceptible to penicillin, clindamycin, and vancomycin. the patient was treated with intravenous penicillin  600 000 units every 6 hours for 3 weeks, and then oral amoxicillin, 500 mg every  6 hours for 3 weeks. the back pain resolved within 2 weeks, and the esr returned  to normal at the end of therapy. follow-up for 3 years showed complete resolution of the infection. patient 2. an 8-year-old boy presented with low back pain and low-grade fever, irritability, and general malaise for 10 days. he had had an upper respiratory tract infection with sore throat 27 days earlier, for which he  received no therapy. the patient had a temperature of 102 degrees f, and physical examination was normal except for tenderness to percussion over the spine between the second and fourth lumbar vertebrae. laboratory tests were normal, except for  the esr (42 mm/hour). radiographs of the spine showed narrowing of the third to fourth lumbar vertebra disk space and irregularity of the margins of the vertebral endplates. a ct scan revealed a lytic bone lesion at lumbar vertebra 4, and bone scan showed an increase uptake of (99m)technetium at the third to fourth lumbar vertebra disk space. ct-guided aspiration of the disk space yielded cloudy nonfoul-smelling material, which was sent for aerobic and anaerobic cultures. gram stain showed numerous white blood cells and fusiform gram-negative bacilli.  anaerobic culture grew light growth of fusobacterium nucleatum. the organism produced beta-lactamase and was susceptible to ticarcillin-clavulanate, clindamycin, metronidazole, and imipenem. therapy with clindamycin 450 mg every 8 hours was given parenterally for 3 weeks and orally for 3 weeks. back pain resolved within 2 weeks. a 2-year follow-up showed complete resolution and no recurrence. this report describes, for the first time, the isolation of anaerobic bacteria from children with diskitis. the lack of their recovery in previous reports and the absence of bacterial growth in over two third of these studies may be caused by the use of improper methods for their collection, transportation, and cultivation. proper choice of antimicrobial therapy for diskitis can be accomplished only by identification of the causative organisms and its antimicrobial susceptibility. this is of particular importance in infections caused by anaerobic bacteria that are often resistant to antimicrobials used to empirically treat diskitis. this was the case in our second patient, who was infected by f nucleatum, which was resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics. the origin of the anaerobic bacteria causing the infection in our patient is probably of endogenous nature. the presence of abdominal pain in the first child may have been attributable to a subclinical abdominal pathothology. the preceding pharyngitis in the second patient may have  been associated with a potential hematogenous spread of f nucleatum. p magnus has been associated with bone and joint infections. this report highlights the importance of obtaining disk space culture for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria from all children with diskitis. future prospective studies are warranted to elucidate the role of anaerobic bacteria in diskitis in children.

TI  == profile of subgingival microbiota in children with mixed dentition.
AB  == a diversity of microbial species has been detected in children's oral flora at an early age. to investigate the composition of the subgingival microbiota of different groups of teeth in children with mixed dentition, 40 systemically healthy children, aged 7-8 years, randomly chosen, were examined. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesiobuccal sites of 21, 41, 16 and 36 permanent teeth and 53, 73, 64 and 84 deciduous teeth. the samples were cultured  for bacterial isolation anaerobically and in 10% co2 plus air using selective and nonselective media. forty-five different microbial species were isolated from both permanent and deciduous teeth. streptococcus sanguis (79-70%), streptococcus mitis (66-65%), prevotella melaninogenica (51-57%), eikenella corrodens (51-52%), capnocytophaga gingivalis (46-34%), capnocytophaga ochracea (45-45%), actinomyces naeslundii (39-60%) and prevotella intermedia (42-35%) were among the most frequently detected species in permanent and deciduous teeth respectively. several suspected periodontal pathogens, such as porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella loescheii, campylobacter gracilis, bacteroides forsythus, campylobacter concisus, peptostreptococcus micros and selenomonas sputigena, albeit less frequently detected, were present in the microbiota of these children. the bacterial species streptococcus constellatus, peptostreptococcus micros, pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, e. corrodens and fusobacterium nucleatum  were associated with non-bleeding permanent and deciduous teeth whereas streptococcus intermedius, c. concisus, p. intermedia and p. loescheii were associated with bleeding.

TI  == bacteriology of histopathologically defined appendicitis in children.
AB  == background: acute appendicitis is the most common surgical emergency in childhood. however, the pathogenesis and detailed microbiology are obscure. objective: to determine in detail the bacterial etiology of appendicitis in children in relation to the histologic tissue pathology. study design: tissue samples obtained at surgery from 41 children with suspected acute appendicitis were examined histologically and by culture for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. the patients were analyzed according to histopathologic and clinical findings. results: aerobic and anaerobic species were isolated from 40 of 41 (98%) samples; on average, 14.1 isolates per specimen (10.4 anaerobes and 3.7 aerobes). specimens from patients with gangrenous appendices yielded significantly higher numbers of anaerobic isolates per specimen than did specimens from patients with  healthy appendices (11.7 vs. 7.7; p < 0.01). bacteria belonging to the bacteroides fragilis group were the most frequently isolated anaerobic microorganisms (95%). other organisms frequently isolated in all histology groups were peptostreptococcus micros (66%), bilophila wadsworthia (63%), fusobacterium  nucleatum (44%), eggerthella lenta (44%) and a hitherto undescribed bile-resistant, pigment-producing gram-negative rod (41%). of the aerobes escherichia coli (88%) and streptococcus anginosus group (former streptococcus "milleri" group) organisms (61%) were the most frequent findings. conclusions: the shift from histologically normal toward gangrenous appendices was clearly associated with markedly elevated anaerobic bacterial counts in terms of species. the unusually high frequencies of b. wadsworthia (75%) and the hitherto undescribed bile-resistant, pigment-producing gram-negative rod (56%) in gangrenous appendices represent unique and different findings from those reported in adults.

TI  == bacterial susceptibility to amoxicillin and potassium clavulanate in advanced periodontitis patients not responding to mechanical therapy.
AB  == background, aims: between 4 and 8% of periodontitis patients are reported to respond poorly to conventional therapy. in these cases, adjunctive use of systemic antibiotics might be a reasonable therapeutic approach. the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of systemic amoxicillin/clavulanate as adjunct to periodontal surgery on the predominant subgingival microorganisms in patients not responding to mechanical therapy. furthermore, the bacterial susceptibility to amoxicillin/clavulanate was analyzed before and after therapy in order to assess the clinical validity of pre-therapeutic susceptibility testing. methods: in 10 periodontitis subjects with no subgingival detection of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, the predominant subgingival organisms were  identified using the identification system rapid id 32 a as well as antibiotic susceptibility was tested utilizing the e test. results: porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella oralis were detected in 7/10 subjects and could no more recovered  after therapy. fusobacterium nucleatum and peptostreptococcus micros were present in 5/10 patients before treatment, but could be detected in 6/10, resp. 3/10 after therapy. in 4/10 subjects harboring f. nucleatum and in 3/10 with p. micros, those organisms were not targeted by amoxicillin/clavulanate, although post-treatment testing revealed their alleged susceptibility (mics varied from 0.023 to 0.032 microg/ml, resp. from 0.125 to 2.0 microg/ ml). conclusions: the results of this study suggest that the outcomes of conventional methods of susceptibility testing have to be interpreted very carefully when being used for  treatment of plaque-related diseases. furthermore, since the endpoint of systemic antibiotic treatment as adjunct to conventional therapy is elimination of f. nucleatum or p. micros in patients harboring these organisms, the use of amoxicillin/clavulanate appears not to be justified.

AB  == background, aims: polymorphisms in the cluster of il-1 genes have been significantly associated with the severity of adult periodontitis. the purpose of this study was to compare microbiological parameters in il-1 genotype negative and positive adult subjects with a range of periodontitis severities. method: the study included 108 subjects in good general health. clinical parameters were recorded at 6 sites/tooth excluding 3rd molars and included: plaque accumulation, gingival erythema, bleeding on probing, suppuration, pocket depth and attachment  level. subgingival plaque samples were collected from the mesiobuccal surface of  up to 28 teeth in each subject (mean 25.3) providing a total of 2736 samples. the levels of 40 subgingival taxa were determined in each sample using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. fingerstick blood samples were collected for il-1a (+4845) and il-1b (+3954) genotyping using pcr-based methods. results: the proportion of  il-1 genotype positive subjects that exhibited mean counts of specific subgingival species above selected thresholds was significantly higher than the proportion of genotype negative subjects. prominent among species that were detected at higher levels in genotype positive subjects were members of the "red" and "orange" complexes and included: bacteroides forsythus, treponema denticola,  the fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies, fusobacterium periodonticum, campylobacter gracilis, campylobacter showae and streptococcus constellatus. streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus gordonii and 3 capnocytophaga species were also detected more frequently at high numbers in genotype positive subjects. significantly higher mean counts of b. forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis, t. denticola, the f. nucleatum subspecies, f. periodonticum, campylobacter rectus, c. showae, eubacterium nodatum, s. constellatus, s. gordonii, and s. intermedius  were detected at periodontal pockets >6 mm in subjects who were genotype positive when compared with genotype negative subjects. the increase was due to increased  numbers of cells of these species rather than a major shift in proportion. conclusion: the data suggest that genotype positive subjects more frequently had  higher levels of "red" and "orange" complex species that are known to be strongly associated with measures of periodontal inflammation.

AB  == background: although extensive microbial analyses have been performed from subgingival plaque samples of periodontitis patients, systematic analysis of subgingival microbiota has not been carried out in a korean population so far. the purpose of this study was to describe the prevalence of major putative periodontopathogens in korean patients by culture-independent methods. methods: a total of 244 subgingival plaque samples (5 sites in each participant) were taken  from 29 advanced adult periodontitis (ap) patients and 20 periodontally healthy subjects. ap samples were obtained from the 4 deepest periodontal pockets (> or =6 mm probing depth [pd]) and 1 healthy site (< or =3 mm pd) in each patient. polymerase chain reaction (pcr) of 16s ribosomal dna (rdna) of subgingival plaque bacteria was performed with eubacterial primers. aliquots of pcr products were then applied on nylon membranes and hybridized with specific oligonucleotide probes labeled with digoxigenin. results: all diseased sites harbored fusobacterium sp., while porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema sp., and bacteroides forsythus were detected in more than 96% of 116 diseased sites. peptostreptococcus micros, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and prevotella intermedia were present in 82%, 74%, and 71% of diseased sites, respectively. in  sites of periodontally healthy subjects, fusobacterium sp. was present in the highest proportion (58%). treponema sp., p. gingivalis, and b. forsythus were detected in 22%, 18%, and 18% of healthy sites, respectively. p. micros, p. intermedia, and a. actinomycetemcomitans were found in 8%, 2%, and 1% of healthy  sites, respectively. the prevalence of the periodontopathogens, with the exceptions of fusobacterium sp. and b. forsythus, was significantly higher in the healthy sites of periodontitis subjects than in the healthy sites of periodontally healthy subjects (p <0.05). conclusions: using highly sensitive methods relying on 16s ribosomal rna-based oligonucleotide probes, we confirmed the strong association of 7 putative periodontopathogens with ap patients in a korean population. with the exceptions of fusobacterium sp. and b. forsythus, all the periodontopathogens were significantly more associated with the healthy sites of periodontitis subjects than in the healthy sites of periodontally healthy subjects.

TI  == the microbial spectrum of brain abscess with special reference to anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the bacteriological and clinical findings of 18 cases of brain abscess are presented. identification and antimicrobial susceptibility of anaerobic strains was performed both by conventional methods and the newer rapid ana ii panel and e-test methods, respectively. characterization of the anaerobic isolates was done by restriction fragment length polymorphism (rflp). anaerobic or aerobic organisms alone were recovered in three (16.6%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic  in another three (16.6%) patients. there were nine anaerobic isolates. the predominant anaerobes were prevotella melaninogenicus (four isolates), bacteroides preacutus (three isolates), fusobacterium nucleatum and peptostreptococcus sp. (one isolate each). a total of six aerobic isolates, all of which were gram-positive cocci were recovered. all the anaerobic isolates were susceptible to metronidazole, but two isolates of p. melaninogenicus were resistant to penicillin. there was complete agreement between the identification  based on biochemical profiles and rflp patterns. these findings indicate the microbial complexity of brain abscess and the need to target antimicrobial therapy against both the aerobic and anaerobic components of infection.

TI  == b-cell deficiency predisposes mice to disseminating anaerobic infections: protection by passive antibody transfer.
AB  == we have previously demonstrated that a high proportion of rag-2 scid knockout mice, which lack t and b cells, develop orofacial abscesses and disseminated infections following pulpal infection, whereas immunocompetent control mice do not. in the present study, we sought to identify the components of the adaptive immune response which contribute to protection against disseminating anaerobic infections and sepsis. for this purpose, various genetically engineered immunodeficient mice were employed, including rag-2 scid, igh-6 (b-cell deficient), tcrb tcrd (t-cell deficient) and hc(0) (c5 deficient). for abscess induction, the mandibular first molars were subjected to pulp exposure on day 0.  teeth were infected with a mixture of four anaerobic pathogens, including prevotella intermedia, streptococcus intermedius, fusobacterium nucleatum, and peptostreptococcus micros, and teeth were sealed to prevent communication with the oral cavity. the findings demonstrate that both rag-2 scid and b-cell-deficient mice, but not t-cell- or c5-deficient mice, have increased susceptibility to the development of disseminating anaerobic infections. abscess-susceptible rag-2 scid and b-cell-deficient mice also showed a significant loss of body weight, splenomegaly, and absent antibacterial antibody  production. furthermore, dissemination was significantly reduced, from 74 to 25%, in susceptible rag-2 mice by passively transferred antibody, predominantly immunoglobulin g2b (igg2b) and igm, against the infecting bacterial innoculum. fractionated igg-enriched preparations were more efficient in transferring protection than igm preparations. we conclude that an antibody-mediated mechanism(s), most likely bacterial opsonization, is of importance in localizing  anaerobic root canal infections and in preventing their systemic spread.

TI  == laboratory diagnosis of anaerobic pleuropulmonary infections.
AB  == anaerobic organisms play a major role in pleuropulmonary infections. clinical manifestations range from simple aspiration to acute, severe, necrotizing pneumonias to chronic infections, such as lung abscess and empyema. implicated pathogens are usually of endogenous origin. laboratory diagnosis of anaerobic pleuropulmonary infections is based on recovering the etiological agent from clinical specimens. appropriate specimens include pleuml fluid, transtracheal aspirates, transthoracic aspirates and fiberoptic bronchoscopic aspirates. collection and transport of uncontaminated specimens is crucial to the recovery of the causative agents. evaluation of a gram's stain of clinical material provides a guide to initial therapy. pigmented and non-pigmented prevotella species, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus species, and bacteriodes species are the most commonly recovered anaerobes in pleuropulmonary infections.  successful treatment of anaerobic pleuropulmonary infections requires a combination of antibiotic therapy and surgical interventions. routine susceptibility testing of recovered isolates is rarely warranted.

TI  == comparative in vitro activities of abt-773 against aerobic and anaerobic pathogens isolated from skin and soft-tissue animal and human bite wound infections.
AB  == we studied the comparative in vitro activities of abt-773, a new ketolide, against 268 aerobic and 148 anaerobic recent isolates from clinical bites using an agar dilution method and inocula of 10(4) cfu/spot for aerobes and 10(5) cfu for anaerobes. the following are the mic ranges and mics at which 90% of isolates are inhibited (mic(90)s) of abt-773 for various isolates, respectively: pasteurella multocida and pasteurella septica, 0.125 to 2 and 1 microg/ml; other  pasteurella species, 0.125 to 1 and 0.5 microg/ml; corynebacterium spp., 0.015 to 0.06 and 0.015 microg/ml; staphylococcus aureus, 0.03 to 0.06 and 0.06 microg/ml; coagulase-negative staphylococci, 0.015 to >32 and 32 microg/ml; streptococci, 0.015 to 0.03 and 0.03 microg/ml; eikenella corrodens, 0.25 to 1 and 1 microg/ml; and bergeyella zoohelcum, 0.03 to 0.25 and 0.06 microg/ml. for anaerobes the mic  ranges and mic(90)s of abt-773 were as follows, respectively: prevotella heparinolytica, 0. 06 to 0.125 and 0.125 microg/ml; prevotella spp., 0.015 to 0.125 and 0.06 microg/ml; porphyromonas spp., 0.015 to 0.03 and 0.015 microg/ml;  fusobacterium nucleatum, 0.5 to 8 and 8 microg/ml; other fusobacterium spp., 0.015 to 8 and 0.5 microg/ml; bacteroides tectum, 0.015 to 0.5 and 0.06 microg/ml; and peptostreptococcus spp., 0.015 to 0.25 and 0.03 microg/ml. abt-773 was more active than all macrolides tested against s. aureus, e. corrodens, and anaerobes, but all compounds were poorly active against f. nucleatum. the activity of abt-773 was within 1 dilution of that of azithromycin against pasteurella spp., and abt-773 was four- to eightfold more active than clarithromycin against pasteurella spp. abt-773 may offer a therapeutic alternative for bite wound infections.

TI  == "checkerboard" assessments of periodontal microbiota and serum antibody responses: a case-control study.
AB  == background: we explored the association between subgingival microbial profiles and serum igg responses to periodontal microbiota in relation to clinical periodontal status. methods: one hundred thirty-one (131) periodontitis patients  aged 29 to 74 years (mean 51.8) were age- and gender-matched with 74 periodontally intact controls (range 26 to 77, mean 49.3). smoking habits and health history were recorded and assessments of plaque, bleeding on probing, probing depth, and attachment level were performed at 6 sites per tooth on all present teeth, excluding third molars. subgingival plaque samples were obtained from each tooth in one upper and one lower quadrant (maximum 14 samples/subject;  2,440 samples total) and analyzed with respect to 19 species by means of whole genomic dna probes. serum igg antibodies against the same 19 species were assessed by an immunoassay. results: cases displayed an average of 22.7 teeth, 20.3 sites with probing depth > or =6 mm, and 18.9 sites with attachment loss > or =6 mm. corresponding figures for controls were 27.1, 0.1, and 1.0, respectively. heavy smoking was 3 times more frequent among cases than controls (32.1% versus 9.6%). higher levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, prevotella melaninogenica, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum, treponema denticola, eubacterium nodatum, peptostreptococcus micros, and campylobacter rectus were found in cases and higher levels of eikenella corrodens, veillonella  parvula, and actinomyces naeslundii in controls. cases displayed higher igg levels against p. gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, while controls displayed higher levels against f. nucleatum, t. denticola, e. nodatum,  and capnocytophaga ochracea. positive correlations between bacterial colonization and antibody responses were identified for 9 species in controls. in cases, however, statistically significant correlations were observed for only 3 species  out of which only one was positive (v. parvula). both bacterial levels and antibody responses declined in ages over 55 years. a logistic regression employing selected elements of bacterial colonization and antibody responses as independent variables resulted in 81.1% correct diagnosis, with sensitivity of 83.1%, specificity of 77.8%, positive predictability of 86%, and negative predictability of 73.7%. smoking did not reach statistical significance in this model. conclusion: a combined microbial colonization/antibody response profile can effectively discriminate between periodontitis patients and periodontally intact controls.

TI  == characterization of bacterial orofacial infections using a new murine model.
AB  == we devised a new murine orofacial infection model using bacteria from odontogenic infection origins and characterized the experimental infections. in this model, bacteria were injected into the submandible of mice. streptococcus constellatus and peptostreptococcus micros produced a single abscess at the injection site and their abscess-forming and lethal abilities were low: the median abscess-forming dose (af(50)) of s. constellatus and p. micros were 10(8.5-10.7)and 10(10.2-10.6)cfu/mouse, and their median lethal dose (ld(50)) were >11 and 10(10.6-11)cfu/mouse, respectively. prevotella oralis and fusobacterium nucleatum produced multiple abscesses and their abscess-forming and lethal abilities were strong: af(50)of p. oralis and f. nucleatum were 10(6.0-6.4)and 10(7. 0-8.7)cfu/mouse, and their ld(50)were 10(7.0-7.7)and 10(8.3-9. 9)cfu/mouse, respectively. ld(50)of p. intermedia and p. gingivalis were 10(9.4->11)and 10(8.9-9.1)cfu/mouse, respectively. prevotella intermedia and porphyromonas gingivalis generated a necrotizing lesion, which progressed rapidly. we conclude  that this murine model could reflect human orofacial odontogenic infections and is useful to investigate the pathogenicity of causative bacteria of such infections.

TI  == interleukin-1 receptor signaling rather than that of tumor necrosis factor is critical in protecting the host from the severe consequences of a polymicrobe anaerobic infection.
AB  == infection of the dental pulp leads to an osteolytic lesion that results from a polymicrobial infection consisting largely of pathogenic anaerobes. infection causes significant morbidity and mortality mediated by bacterial factors and in some cases by the up-regulation of inflammatory cytokines. the inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1 (il-1) and tumor necrosis factor (tnf), in particular, play a complex and central role in the responses to microbial pathogens. however, relatively little is known about the significance of these cytokines in protecting the host from focal polymicrobial anaerobic infections. to establish the relative importance of il-1 and tnf in mediating the response to a mixed anaerobic infection, we inoculated the dental pulp of mice with six anaerobic pathogens containing functional deletions of receptors to il-1 (il-1r1(-/-)), tnf (tnfrp55(-/-)-p75(-/-)), or both (tnfrp55(-/-)-il-1ri(-/-)). the results indicate that il-1 receptor signaling and tnf receptor signaling both play similarly important roles in protecting the host from local tissue damage. however, il-1 receptor signaling is considerably more important than tnf receptor signaling in  preventing the spread of infection into surrounding fascial planes, since il-1r1(-/-) but not tnfrp55(-/-)-p75(-/-) mice exhibited significantly higher morbidity and mortality. moreover, all of the fatal infections occurred in male mice, suggesting the importance of gender differences in limiting the impact of these infections.

TI  == toll-like receptor 4-deficient mice have reduced bone destruction following mixed anaerobic infection.
AB  == c3h/hej mice have an impaired ability to respond to lipopolysaccharide (lps) due  to a mutation in the gene that encodes toll-like receptor 4 (tlr4). the effect of tlr4 deficiency on host responses to endodontic infections is unknown. in the present study, we compared periapical bone destruction, sepsis, and inflammatory  cytokine production in lps-hyporesponsive c3h/hej and wild-type control c3h/heouj mice. the mandibular first molars of both strains were subjected to pulpal exposure and infection with a mixture of four anaerobic pathogens, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, streptococcus intermedius, and peptostreptococcus micros. at sacrifice on day 21, tlr4-deficient c3h/hej mice had significantly reduced periapical bone destruction compared to wild-type c3h/heouj mice (p < 0.001). the decreased bone destruction in c3h/hej correlated  with reduced expression of the bone resorptive cytokines interleukin 1alpha (il-1alpha) (p < 0.01) and il-1beta (p < 0.05) as well as the proinflammatory cytokine il-12 (p < 0.05). no significant differences were seen in the levels of  gamma interferon, tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha), or il-10 between the two strains. the expression of il-1alpha, il-1beta, tnf-alpha, il-10, and il-12 were all significantly reduced in vitro in macrophages from both tlr4-deficient c3h/hej and c57bl/10scncr strains, compared to wild-type controls. notably, the responses of tlr4-deficient macrophages to both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria were similarly reduced. neither c3h/hej nor c3h/heouj mice exhibited orofacial abscess development or infection dissemination as determined by splenomegaly or cachexia. we conclude that intact tlr function mediates increased proinflammatory responses and bone destruction in response to mixed anaerobic infections.

TI  == the periodontal abscess (i). clinical and microbiological findings.
AB  == background/aims: little information is available regarding the diagnosis and microbiology of periodontal abscesses. the aim of this descriptive clinical and microbiological study was to provide more information in order to help in the characterisation of the periodontal abscess associated to periodontitis. method:  29 consecutive patients with a periodontal abscess were studied by the assessment of clinical variables, including both subjective (pain, edema, redness and swelling) and objective (bleeding on probing, suppuration, probing pocket depth,  tooth mobility and cervical lymphadenopathy) parameters. microbiological samples  were taken for anaerobic microbiology and processed by means of culture. systemic involvement was also studied through the analysis of blood and urine samples using conventional laboratory standards. results: 62% of the abscesses affected untreated periodontitis patients, and 69% were associated with a molar tooth. more than 75% of the abscesses had moderate-severe scores related to edema, redness and swelling, and 90% of the patients reported pain. bleeding occurred in all abscesses, while suppuration on sampling was detected in 66%. mean associated pocket depth was 7.28 mm, and 79% of teeth presented some degree of mobility. cervical lymphadenopathy was seen in 10% of patients, while elevated leucocyte counts were observed in 31.6%. the absolute number of neutrophils was elevated in 42% of the patients. high prevalences of putative periodontal pathogens were found, including fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus micros, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and bacteroides forsythus. conclusions: the periodontal abscess has clear clinical characteristics and is usually associated with severe periodontal destruction. this condition may cause  systemic involvement and the lesion generally has a large bacterial mass with a high prevalence of well-recognised periodontal pathogens.

TI  == features of severe periodontal disease in a teenager with chediak-higashi syndrome.
AB  == background: chediak-higashi syndrome (c-hs) is a rare congenital disease characterized by defective neutrophil function with abnormal lysosomal inclusions, neutropenia, and reduced chemotaxis. the complete syndrome includes oculocutaneous albinism with photophobia, neurologic features, recurrent infections, and enterocolitis. methods: a 14-year-old male c-hs patient was referred to us because of serious periodontal destruction with acute inflamed gingiva and ulcers. clinical and biological investigations were performed, leading to the diagnosis of c-hs. results: laboratory findings included neutropenia and hypergammaglobulinemia. peripheral blood smears showed giant granules in neutrophils, eosinophils, and granulocytes. bone marrow smears showed giant inclusions in leukocyte precursor cells. these granules and inclusions were characteristic of chediak-higashi syndrome. oral radiographic status showed extensive loss of alveolar bone leading, in most cases, to tooth exfoliation. bacteria often associated with periodontitis were detected in subgingival plaque  samples, including fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, prevotella melaninogenica, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and clostridium sp. biopsies of periodontal tissues for light and electronic microscopic examinations revealed massive bacterial invasion of the epithelial tissue, epithelial cells, and connective tissue. ultrastructural observations of periodontal polymorphonuclear  leukocytes showed defective granulation, with abnormal granules not discharging their lysosomal content against engulfed bacteria. viable dividing bacteria were  found in the cytoplasm. conclusions: in this case, early-onset periodontitis seems to be the expression of c-hs granulocyte deficiency. periodontal treatment  of these patients is often unsuccessful. this case report illustrates the importance of the dentist in initiating clinical and biological investigations in such early aggressive periodontitis in young patients.

AB  == published reports on the in vitro activity of gemifloxacin mesylate (sb 265805),  a new fluoronaphthyridone, against anaerobic pathogens are reviewed here. the studies used a variety of media, inocula and antimicrobial agents. using a proposed breakpoint of 0.5 mg/l, these studies showed that gemifloxacin had generally higher potency against gram-positive anaerobes (clostridium perfringens, all peptostreptococcus spp.) and fusobacteria (fusobacterium nucleatum, fusobacterium necrophorum) and moderate but variable potency against gram-negative anaerobes. bacteroides stercoris, bacteroides tectum and many bacteroides fragilis isolates were inhibited by concentrations of < or =0.5 mg/l, while the other species of the b. fragilis group required higher concentrations for inhibition. species variability was evident: porphyromonas asaccharolytica, porphyromonas canoris, porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas macaccae, prevotella heparinolytica and prevotella intermedia were susceptible to 0.5 mg/l  of gemifloxacin while most other porphyromonas and prevotella spp. were not. these data suggest that gemifloxacin may have a clinical role in the treatment of certain dental, head and neck and pleuropulmonary infections in which gram-positive anaerobes, fusobacteria and some prevotella and porphyromonas spp.  may predominate.

TI  == profile of subgingival microbiota in children with primary dentition.
AB  == eruption of primary teeth has a great influence on the oral environment by providing suitable niches for bacterial colonization. the aim of the study was to investigate the composition of the subgingival microbiota of primary incisors, canines and molars in 40 systemically healthy children aged 4-5 yr, chosen randomly. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesiobuccal sites of primary incisors (61, 81), canines (53, 73) and molars (64, 84). the samples were cultured for bacterial isolation anaerobically and in 10% co2 plus air using selective and non-selective media. forty-one different microbial species were isolated. gemella morbillorum and peptostreptococcus magnus were statistically significantly more frequently detected in incisors while p. micros, streptococcus intermedius, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella loeschei, p. melaninogenica and selenomonas sputigena were more frequently detected in molars. the bacterial species s. constellatus, g. morbillorum and p. magnus were  isolated in greater numbers in incisors and p. micros, s. intermedius, campylobacter concisus, bacteroides egertheii, b. forsythus, p. oralis and s. sputigena were isolated in greater numbers in molars, respectively. cluster analysis revealed 4 clusters in which 6-7 bacterial species were elevated above mean levels. cluster i was predominated by s. constellatus, s. mitis, s. sanguis, g. morbillorum, p. melaninogenica and p. oralis; cluster ii was predominated by s. sanguis, actinomyces naeslundii, capnocytophaga gingivalis, c. ochracea and p. intermedia; cluster iii was predominated by s. mitis, c. ochracea, f. nucleatum,  p. loeschei, p. melaninogenica and p. oralis; and finally cluster iv was predominated by s. sanguis, c. gingivalis, veillonella parvula, campylobacter gracilis, f. nucleatum and p. intermedia. the bacterial species s. constellatus,  p. micros, pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, eikenella corrodens and f. nucleatum were associated with non-bleeding sites while s. intermedius, c. concisus, p. intermedia and p. loescheii were found more frequently in bleeding sites.

TI  == peptostreptococcus micros coaggregates with fusobacterium nucleatum and non-encapsulated porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == coaggregation is one of the potential colonization strategies of oral microorganisms, often involving fimbrial structures in the interactions. in this  study, the coaggregation characteristics of the rough and smooth genotypes of the periodontal pathogen peptostreptococcus micros were compared to investigate the role of the fibril-like structures of the rough genotype in coaggregation. of the 11 oral species tested, only fusobacterium nucleatum strains and non-encapsulated porphyromonas gingivalis strains coaggregated with p. micros. no differences in coaggregation between the smooth type (sm), the rough type (rg) and the smooth variant of the rg type (rg(sm)) of p. micros were observed. heat-stable, periodate-sensitive structures on p. micros appeared to interact with heat- and protease-sensitive structures on f. nucleatum and p. gingivalis. these data indicate that these unimodal coaggregations are not mediated by the proteinaceous fibril-like structures of the rg genotype, but by carbohydrates present on both genotypes of p. micros.

TI  == dexamethasone differentially regulates cytokine transcription and translation in  macrophages responding to bacteria or okadaic acid.
AB  == many microorganisms and microbial products induce expression of pro-inflammatory  cytokines such as interleukin-1 (il-1alpha/beta) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) in macrophages, primarily by transcriptional activation. we show here, by using mouse macrophages in primary culture, that pre-treatment with dexamethasone inhibits bacteria-induced il-1beta expression as mrna and cellular  pro-il-1beta in parallel, consistent with an effect primarily on transcriptional  activation. in contrast, the expression of tnf-alpha mrna was only partly inhibited despite virtually complete inhibition of tnf-alpha protein formation. furthermore, the selective induction of primarily cell-associated 26,000 m, pro-tnf-alpha by the protein phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid also was partly inhibited at the mrna level by dexamethasone, whereas additional translational inhibition appeared to be lacking. this latter finding is reminiscent of earlier  findings regarding signalling to activation of cytosolic phospholipase a2, which  is sensitive to dexamethasone when elicited by bacteria, but not when elicited by okadaic acid. the present results raise the possibility that the inhibitory effect of dexamethasone on tnf-alpha translation, but not on transcriptional activation, is mediated by one or more okadaic acid-sensitive protein phosphatases.

TI  == microbiological features of papillon-lefevre syndrome periodontitis.
AB  == papillon-lefevre syndrome patients exhibit hyperkeratosis palmo-plantaris and severe periodontitis. the syndrome is an autosomal recessive trait, but the mechanism of periodontal destruction is not known. this report presents the clinical and microbiological features of an 11-year old girl with papillon-lefevre syndrome. clinical examination included conventional periodontal measurements and radiographic analysis. in samples from 3 deep periodontal lesions, the occurrence of major suspected periodontopathic bacteria was determined by selective and non-selective culture and polymerase chain reaction (pcr) identification, and the presence of cytomegalovirus and epstein-barr type 1 virus by a nested-pcr detection method. 10 of 22 available teeth demonstrated severe periodontal breakdown. major cultivable bacteria included actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (3.4% of total isolates), prevotella nigrescens (16.4%), fusobacterium nucleatum (14.3%) and peptostreptococcus micros (10.6%). a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. nigrescens, porphyromonas gingivalis and eikenella corrodens were identified by pcr analysis. the patient's non-affected parents and older brother revealed several periodontal pathogens but not a. actinomycetemcomitans. the viral examination demonstrated cytomegalovirus and epstein-barr type 1 virus in the subgingival sample of the papillon-lefevre syndrome patient. the father and brother yielded subgingival cytomegalovirus but  not epstein-barr type 1 virus. we hypothesize that human herpesviruses in concert with a. actinomycetemcomitans play important roles in the development of papillon-lefevre syndrome periodontitis.

AB  == infections of the dental pulp commonly result in infraosseus inflammation and bone destruction. however, the role of phagocytic leucocytes in the pathogenesis  of pulpal infections has been uncertain. in this work we used p/e-/- selectin-deficient mice, which lack rolling adhesion of leucocytes to endothelium and mimic the human syndrome, leucocyte adhesion deficiency ii (lad-ii), to test  the hypothesis that phagocytic leucocytes protect against pulpal infection and subsequent periapical infraosseus bone resorption. p/e-/- mice and p/e+/+ wild-type controls were subjected to surgical pulp exposure, and both groups were infected with a mixture of pulpal pathogens including prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus micros and streptococcus intermedius. animals were killed after 20 days, and the extent of infraosseus bone destruction was quantified by histomorphometry. in two separate experiments, p/e-/- mice had  significantly greater bone resorption than p/e+/+ controls. the increased bone destruction correlated with a twofold decrease in polymorphonuclear (pmn) infiltration into periapical inflammatory tissues of p/e-/- mice. p/e-/- mice had higher tissue levels of the bone resorptive cytokine, interleukin (il)-1alpha. tissue levels of il-2, il-4, il-10, tumour necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) and  interferon-gamma (ifn-gamma) were all higher in p/e-/- mice, but the increases were not statistically significant. only il-12 was higher in p/e+/+ mice, possibly reflecting a greater number of infiltrating monocytes in wild-type mice. these findings demonstrate that phagocytic leucocytes are protective in this model, and suggest that elevated expression of inflammatory cytokines is responsible for the observed bone destruction.

TI  == porphyromonas gingivalis prevalence related to other micro-organisms in adult refractory periodontitis.
AB  == forty-six adult periodontal patients, selected on the basis of clinical examination, and 46 adult healthy subjects were examined. the subgingival plaque  samples from one inflammatory and one non-inflammatory site of each periodontal patient were studied to determine porphyromonas gingivalis prevalence related to  other periodontal micro-organisms and to periodontal tissue destruction. the results showed porphyromonas gingivalis as the main pathogenic micro-organism isolated in the inflammatory sites together with bacteroides forsythus. peptostreptococcus sp., actinomyces sp. and prevotella sp. were found as a normal oral flora in the healthy subjects. fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia, campylobacter rectus and eikenella corrodens were detected both in inflammatory and in non-inflammatory sites of periodontal patients as well as in  the healthy subjects.

TI  == clinical and microbiological effects of initial periodontal therapy in conjunction with amoxicillin and clavulanic acid in patients with adult periodontitis. a randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled study.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to investigate the clinical and microbiological  effects of initial periodontal therapy in conjunction with systemic amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid in adult periodontitis patients using a double-blind, parallel-group, and placebo-controlled protocol. 21 patients with a clinical diagnosis of generalised adult periodontitis were recruited. clinical measurements and microbiological assessments were carried out at baseline, 3, and 12 months post-treatment. approximately 6 weeks after initial periodontal treatment (3-6 h), patients were randomly assigned to receive coded study medication of 500 mg amoxicillin plus 125 mg clavulanic acid (augmentin) or placebo, every 8 h for 10 days. patients returned for follow-up visits 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after completion of the medication. the mean plaque index (pi) at baseline was 1.1 for placebo group and 0.9 for the test group. at 3 months, the pi had dropped to 0.3 in both groups, and was maintained during the rest of the study. the changes in bleeding on probing (bop) and gingival index (gi) in the course of the study were similar in both groups. the mean whole mouth probing pocket depth (ppd) in the placebo group was 3.8 mm at baseline and 3.9 mm in the  test group. a mean reduction of 1.0 mm in the placebo group and 0.9 mm in the test group was observed during the first 3 months. no further reduction in ppd was noticed during the study period in either group. there was no statistically significant difference in the ppd reduction between the 2 groups. the change in clinical attachment level (cal) from baseline to 3 months amounted to 0.5 mm in both groups. between 3 and 12 months, the cal changed in neither group. in both groups, treatment resulted in a decrease in the number of spirochetes and motile  rods in positive patients, but no significant differences between either group were noted in any of the dark field microscopy observations. at baseline, 1 patient in the placebo group and 2 patients in the test group were culture positive for actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa). after therapy, aa was not detectable in the placebo group and 1 patient remained positive in the test group. in the placebo group, the number of patients positive for porphyromonas gingivalis (pg) decreased from 7 to 2 after therapy. in the test group, the 4 patients positive for pg at baseline remained positive after therapy. in both groups, all subjects were positive for prevotella intermedia (pi) and fusobacterium nucleatum (fn) at baseline. at 12 months, all subjects had detectable subgingival fn. 9 out of the 11 placebo and 8 of the 10 test patients  remained positive for pi. there were no differences in detection frequency of peptostreptococcus micros (pm) and bacteroides forsythus (bf) in both groups between baseline, 3, and 12 months post-treatment. the findings demonstrated that, in comparison to placebo, systemic amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid provided no additional clinical and microbiological effects in the treatment of adult periodontitis patients.

TI  == flow cytometry to monitor phagocytosis and oxidative burst of anaerobic periodontopathogenic bacteria by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes.
AB  == the reduced susceptibility to phagocytosis found among some periodontopathogenic  anaerobes may account for the differences between invasive and non-invasive strains. we applied flow cytometry as a powerful tool to analyze and quantify phagocytosis using standardized cultures of oral anaerobes (porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, p. nigrescens, capnocytophaga gingivalis, c. ochracea, c. sputigena, fusobacterium nucleatum and peptostreptococcus micros) and heparinized whole blood. bacteria were labeled by a fluorescein-methylester and their esterase activity, resulting in green fluorescence. ingested bacteria could be detected easily and quantified by a shift towards green fluorescence in  the pmnl population involved and a concomitant decrease in the bacterial population. furthermore, the oxidative burst of pmnls was detected in parallel assays using the dye dhr123 which becomes fluorescent upon oxidation during the oxidative burst process. we found a great diversity in phagocytosis susceptibility determined by estimating the portion of phagocytosing pmnls, ranging from 10.6% (strain w83) to > 99.4% (e.g. atcc 33277t) in p. gingivalis and from 15.9% (strain mh5) to > 95% (atcc 33563t) in p. nigrescens. in contrast, almost all p. intermedia strains as well as the representatives of the other anaerobic, putative periodontopathic species tested showed no or only moderate resistance in the phagocytosis assay. comparison of clinical data of patients and the extent of phagocytosis resistance of the corresponding p. gingivalis strains  suggests that this virulence factor may contribute to the clinical outcome.

TI  == antibiotic susceptibility of putative periodontal pathogens in advanced periodontitis patients.
AB  == in the present study, the antibiotic susceptibility of most prevalent micro-organisms in advanced periodontitis patients was evaluated. in 56 patients, pooled subgingival plaque samples were taken from the deepest site of each quadrant and were cultivated anaerobically. from each patient, the 4 most frequently encountered types of bacterial colonies were subcultured and identified (rapid id 32 a). from all bacterial species identified in the 224 subcultures, the 4 most prevalent were used for susceptibility testing to tetracycline, metronidazole and amoxicillin/clavulanate using the e test. the most prevalent microorganisms were fusobacterium nucleatum (38/214), peptostreptococcus micros (33/214), prevotella oralis (33/214) and porphyromonas  gingivalis (32/214). regarding antibiotic susceptibility it could be shown that minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) in all cases was below antibiotic concentrations achievable in gingival crevicular fluid. however, antibiotic resistance was seen in 3 to 29% of the investigated microorganisms.

TI  == effects of hydrogen peroxide on growth and selected properties of porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == in this study we first evaluated the effects of hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) on growth and selected properties of porphyromonas gingivalis, and compared them with those obtained by a reducing agent (cysteine). the growth of p. gingivalis was only moderately affected when h2o2 was added at concentrations up to 30 mm in a complex culture medium. however, when a defined basal medium was used, h2o2 at  a concentration of 3 mm completely inhibited growth of p. gingivalis. incorporation of cysteine at concentrations up to 30 mm in both media had no effect on growth. the effects of h2o2 and cysteine on cell-associated hemagglutinating and arg-gingipain activities were evaluated using bacteria grown in the complex culture medium. both activities were strongly decreased when h2o2  was added in the assay mixtures. this inhibitory effect of h2o2 was reversible. on the other hand, including cysteine in the assay mixtures increased both activities. h2o2 and cysteine had no effect on the expression of heat shock protein (hsp)-68 and hsp-75 by p. gingivalis, as determined by sds-page and western immunoblotting analysis. in the second part of the study, we tested whether growth of selected oral bacterial species may modify the oxidation-reduction potential (eh) of the environment. it was found that certain  species were able to either decrease (p. gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus micros, streptococcus mutans) or increase (streptococcus sanguis) the eh of the medium. our study provides evidence that an oxidizing agent such as h2o2 may affect the biology of p. gingivalis. moreover, growth of some members of the oral microflora can generate oxidizing and reducing conditions, and thus potentially influence the ecology of subgingival sites by affecting strictly anaerobic bacteria such as p. gingivalis.

TI  == coaggregation of candida dubliniensis with fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  == the binding of microorganisms to each other and oral surfaces contributes to the  progression of microbial infections in the oral cavity. candida dubliniensis, a newly characterized species, has been identified in human immunodeficiency virus-seropositive patients and other immunocompromised individuals. c. dubliniensis phenotypically resembles candida albicans in many respects yet can be identified and differentiated as a unique candida species by phenotypic and genetic profiles. the purpose of this study was to determine oral coaggregation (coag) partners of c. dubliniensis and to compare these findings with coag of c.  albicans under the same environmental conditions. fifteen isolates of c. dubliniensis and 40 isolates of c. albicans were tested for their ability to coaggregate with strains of fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus micros, peptostreptococcus magnus, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia. when c. dubliniensis and c. albicans strains were grown at 37 degrees c on sabouraud dextrose agar, only c. dubliniensis strains coaggregated with f. nucleatum atcc 49256 and no c. albicans strains showed coag. however, when the c. dubliniensis and c. albicans strains were grown at 25 or 45 degrees c, both c. dubliniensis and c. albicans strains demonstrated coag with f. nucleatum. heating the c. albicans strains (grown at 37 degrees c) at 85 degrees c for 30 min or treating them with dithiothreitol allowed the c. albicans strains grown at 37 degrees c to coaggregate with f. nucleatum. coag at all growth temperatures was inhibited by mannose and alpha-methyl mannoside but not by edta or arginine. the coag reaction between f.  nucleatum and the candida species involved a heat-labile component on f. nucleatum and a mannan-containing heat-stable receptor on the candida species. the coag reactions between f. nucleatum and the candida species may be important  in the colonization of the yeast in the oral cavity, and the coag of c. dubliniensis by f. nucleatum when grown at 37 degrees c provides a rapid, specific, and inexpensive means to differentiate c. dubliniensis from c. albicans isolates in the clinical laboratory.

TI  == microbiota of successful osseointegrated dental implants.
AB  == background: the long-term survival of dental implants depends, in part, on control of bacterial infection in the peri-implant region. periodontal pathogens  colonized implants symptomatic through infection, whereas the microbiota of successful implants was similar to that of periodontal health. this study examined the impact on the peri-implant microbiota of crown restorations; implant type; length of time of loading; history of implant or periodontal infections; and whether implants replaced single or multiple teeth. it was of particular interest to evaluate implant colonization by species in a newly described red complex of periodontal pathogens, porphyromonas gingivalis and bacteroides forsythus. methods: this study sampled 43 partially edentulous subjects with successfully osseointegrated titanium root-form dental implants. eighty-one (81)  non-submerged and 20 submerged asymptomatic implants, 83 crowned, and 36 uncrowned teeth were sampled from peri-implant or subgingival sites. the microbiota of samples was evaluated using whole genomic dna probes in a checkerboard assay to 23 subgingival species. results: implants were colonized principally by oral streptococci, capnocytophagae, veillonella parvula, peptostreptococcus micros, and fusobacterium nucleatum. the periodontal species,  p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, and campylobacter rectus were detected in a few subjects. the microbiota around crowned implants and crowned teeth was similar. streptococcus oralis, p. intermedia, and selenomonas noxia were elevated in samples from uncrowned teeth compared to crowned teeth and implants. microbial complexity increased as loading time increased, but colonization by periodontal pathogens, including red complex  species, was higher in subjects with previous periodontal disease. no differences were observed in the microbiota of 1- and 2-stage implants, or between implants supporting single or multiple restorations. conclusions: while presence of crowns had only a minor impact on the peri-implant microbiota, microbial changes were observed the longer the implants had been in function and in those patients with  a history of periodontal or peri-implant infections. a history of periodontitis had a greater impact on the peri-implant microbiota than implant loading time. the major influence on the peri-implant microbiota was, however, the microbiota on remaining teeth. p. gingivalis and b. forsythus, red complex periodontal pathogens, colonized several implants, although all implants were successfully osseointegrated.

TI  == relationship of the subgingival microbiota to a chairside test for aspartate aminotransferase in gingival crevicular fluid.
AB  == background: the aim of the present study was to evaluate the association between  the occurrence of certain specific periodontal pathogens and aspartate aminotransferase (ast) levels in gingival crevicular fluid (gcf). methods: thirty systemically healthy subjects with moderate to advanced periodontitis were selected. within each subject, the ast contents of gcf from sites with probing depth between 5 mm and 7 mm were measured using a chairside colorimetric test. ast-positive site refers to one that had an ast level > or = 800 microiu. subgingival plaque samples from one ast-positive and one negative site were collected for microbiological examination. one site with probing depth < or = 3 mm and no gingival inflammation was selected as a healthy control. clinical parameters of the chosen sites, including the plaque index and gingival index scores, probing depth, and clinical attachment level were measured. culture and immunofluorescence (if) were used for detecting common periodontal pathogens, including actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, peptostreptococcus micros, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, capnocytophaga species, prevotella intermedia, prevotella melaninogenica, and porphyromonas gingivalis. logistic regression was used to analyze the correlation between the ast test and certain specific pathogens. results: the gcf scores and  total cultivable bacterial counts were higher in ast-positive sites than either ast-negative or healthy sites. the prevalence and proportions of specific periodontal pathogens such as c rectus, e. corrodens, f. nucleatum, capnocytophaga species, p. intermedia, and p. gingivalis were significantly higher in positive than in negative sites. in analyzing the correlation of the proportion of 6 pathogens with the ast test by logistic regression, only p. gingivalis showed a significant positive correlation. the odds ratio of having a  high proportion of p. gingivalis in the presence of a positive ast test was 1.21. conclusions: the present study showed that at ast-positive sites, there is a higher prevalence and higher proportion of certain periodontal pathogens. although only the correlation of p. gingivalis and ast values was statistically significant, the results imply that certain periodontal pathogens may be associated with elevation of ast levels in gcf.

TI  == coronal leakage: endotoxin penetration from mixed bacterial communities through obturated, post-prepared root canals.
AB  == coronal leakage has been considered as one of the major causes of failure in root canal treatment. bacteria have been shown to penetrate the root canal obturating  materials and influence the periapical tissues. endotoxin, a component of gram-negative bacteria, is a potent inflammatory agent and may be able to penetrate obturating materials faster than bacteria. this in vitro study examined the possible penetration of post-prepared canals by endotoxin and bacterial cells derived from mixed bacterial communities. results showed that both bacteria and endotoxin were able to penetrate the obturating materials in post-prepared canals; however, endotoxin penetration was faster than bacterial. if one speculates that a similar sequence of events occurs clinically, then such a rapid penetration of endotoxin could lead to an early periapical reaction, with subsequent treatment failure and need for retreatment or periapical surgery. the  need for an immediate and proper coronal restoration after root canal treatment is therefore reinforced.

AB  == the microbiologic features of infected sinus aspirates in nine children with neurologic impairment were studied. anaerobic bacteria, always mixed with aerobic and facultative bacteria, were isolated in 6 (67%) aspirates and aerobic bacteria only in 3 (33%). there were 24 bacterial isolates, 12 aerobic or facultative and  12 anaerobic. the predominant aerobic isolates were klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus (2 each) and proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, and streptococcus pneumoniae (1 each). the predominant anaerobes were prevotella sp.  (5), peptostreptococcus sp. (4), fusobacterium nucleatum (2), and bacteroides fragilis (1). beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were isolated from 8 (89%) patients. organisms similar to those recovered from the sinuses were also isolated from tracheostomy site and gastrostomy wound aspirates in five of seven  instances. this study demonstrates the uniqueness of the microbiologic features of sinusitis in neurologically impaired children, in which, in addition to the organisms known to cause infection in children without neurologic impairment, facultative and anaerobic gram-negative organisms that can colonize other body sites are predominant.

TI  == preterm birth: associations with genital and possibly oral microflora.
AB  == opportunistic pathogenic microbes are indigenous to the female lower genital tract and etiologic in many types of pelvic infections and, apparently, a portion of preterm birth (ptb) cases. bacterial vaginosis (bv) is a clinical syndrome based on an altered genital microflora in which gardnerella vaginalis; anaerobic  species primarily among prevotella, porphyromonas, bacteroides, peptostreptococcus, and mobiluncus; mycoplasma hominis; and ureaplasma urealyticum become predominant in vaginal secretions. this bv complex of microbes, compared to a normal vaginal microflora dominated by facultative lactobacilli, is associated with significantly increased risks for preterm labor, preterm premature rupture of membranes, ptb, and other perinatal infectious complications. pathogenetic mechanisms include an ascending route of infection and/or inflammatory process due to microbial products and maternal and/or fetal response(s) with production of prostaglandins and cytokines. in the presence of periodontal disease, oral opportunistic pathogens and/or their inflammatory products also may have a role in prematurity via a hematogenous route. fusobacterium nucleatum, a common oral species, is the most frequently isolated species from amniotic fluid cultures among women with preterm labor and intact membranes. also, the species and subspecies of fusobacteria identified from amniotic fluid most closely match those reported from healthy and diseased subgingival sites, namely f. nucleatum subspecies vincentii and f. nucleatum subspecies nucleatum, compared to strains identified from the lower genital tract. although these fusobacteria also could be acquired through cunnilingus from a partner, new data associating maternal periodontal disease with preterm low birth weight taken with the isolation of f. nucleatum, capnocytophaga, and other oral species from amniotic fluid support further study of a possible additional route, oral-hematogenous, to ptb.

AB  == the present study primarily aimed at investigating the oral microbiota in smokers and non-smokers with established gingivitis and monitoring its composition during experimental gingivitis. secondly, it aimed at examining whether the composition  of the microbiota is associated with different levels of gingival inflammation during this experimental gingivitis trial. for this purpose, 25 non-dental university students with gingivitis were recruited. 11 subjects were smokers and  14 were non-smokers. after achieving gingival health, they entered a 14-day experimental gingivitis trial. plaque and bleeding were assessed before entering  into the study (intake), at day 0, day 5 and at day 14 of the experiment. microbiological samples from mucosal sites and dental plaque (taken at intake, day 0, and day 14) were analysed for the presence of actinomyces species, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus, campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus micros, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and streptococcus species. at day 14 of the experimental period, the level of plaque formation was not different between smokers and non-smokers, but bleeding scores were lower in smokers than in non-smokers (15% and 30% respectively, p=0.01). the change from natural gingivitis to a state of gingival health and a subsequent change from gingival health to experimentally induced gingivitis was accompanied by quantitative alterations in the cultivable microbiota in both groups. changes were most prominent in the transition from gingival health to experimental gingivitis and were found in dental plaque for actinomyces species, c. rectus, f. nucleatum, and p. intermedia. within the group of non-smokers, a distinction was made between subjects with a 'weak' or 'strong' inflammatory response. no relationship with a  single bacterial species could be established which would likely explain the differences in levels of inflammation. it is concluded that differences in response to experimental gingivitis are not caused by major differences in the composition of the oral microbiota.

AB  == the majority of bacteria associated with infections of endodontic origin are strict anaerobes. the purpose of this study was to develop an endodontic microleakage model using strict anaerobic bacteria in a two-chamber system. nine  species of anaerobic bacteria were tested for viability and detection by either turbidity or color change of the broth. a survey of ph chromogenic substrates revealed that bromcresol purple (ph 5.2 = yellow, ph 6.8 = purple) could be used  as a chromogenic indicator to detect the growth of anaerobic bacteria. peptone-yeast extract-glucose broth (pyg) and brain heart infusion broth (bhi) were each used alone and with bromcresol purple (bppyg, bpbhi) in this study. fusobacterium nucleatum and f. necrophorum were viable in all four media for > 2  wk and produced both turbidity and a color change after only 1 day of incubation. veillonella parvula in either bpbhi or bhi and peptostreptococcus anaerobius in either bppyg or bhi were viable for > 2 wk and showed a color change or turbidity after 1 or 2 days. the results indicate that leakage of strict anaerobes may be evaluated in a two-chamber system.

TI  == effect of red blood cells on the growth of porphyromonas endodontalis and microbial community development.
AB  == establishment of a microbial community in the root canal system depends on numerous factors, of which nutrient availability may be one of the most important. we hypothesized that the presence of red blood cells or hemoglobin in  this environment could cause shifts in microbial composition of communities, resulting in organisms such as porphyromonas endodontalis becoming more dominant. an in vitro model system using mixed, batch cultures was performed with the bacteria p. endodontalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus micros and  campylobacter rectus. bacteria were cultured in media with or without the addition of washed red blood cells, hemoglobin, or serum. cyclic growth studies revealed that p. endodontalis was lost from the community of organisms after three cycles. however, inclusion of red blood cells resulted in establishment of  this organism. moreover, red blood cells added to pure cultures of p. endodontalis substantially enhanced growth and protected the organisms from oxygen. we conclude that the presence of red blood cells could result in shifts of microbial communities of organisms within the root canal system.

TI  == microbial complexes in subgingival plaque.
AB  == it has been recognized for some time that bacterial species exist in complexes in subgingival plaque. the purpose of the present investigation was to attempt to define such communities using data from large numbers of plaque samples and different clustering and ordination techniques. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in 185 subjects (mean age 51 +/- 16 years) with (n = 160) or without (n = 25) periodontitis. the presence and levels  of 40 subgingival taxa were determined in 13,261 plaque samples using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. clinical assessments were made at 6 sites per tooth at each visit. similarities between pairs of species were computed using phi coefficients and species clustered using an averaged unweighted linkage sort. community ordination was performed using principal components analysis and correspondence analysis. 5 major complexes were consistently observed using any of the analytical methods. one complex consisted  of the tightly related group: bacteroides forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola. the 2nd complex consisted of a tightly related core group including members of the fusobacterium nucleatum/periodonticum subspecies, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and peptostreptococcus micros. species associated with this group included: eubacterium nodatum, campylobacter rectus, campylobacter showae, streptococcus constellatus and campylobacter gracilis. the 3rd complex consisted of streptococcus sanguis, s. oralis, s. mitis, s. gordonii and s. intermedius. the 4th complex was comprised of 3 capnocytophaga species, campylobacter concisus, eikenella corrodens and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans serotype a. the 5th complex consisted of veillonella parvula and actinomyces odontolyticus. a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b, selenomonas noxia and actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2 (a. viscosus) were outliers with little relation to each other and the 5 major complexes. the 1st complex related strikingly to clinical measures of periodontal disease particularly pocket depth and bleeding on probing.

TI  == coronal leakage of mixed anaerobic bacteria after obturation and post space preparation.
AB  == objectives: the purpose of this study was to assess bacterial leakage of a mixed  anaerobic community of organisms in obturated canals after post space preparation. study design: a mixed microbial community of strict anaerobic organisms (f. nucleatum, p. micros and c. rectus) was developed. with the use of  an in vitro model system, coronal leakage was assessed in 40 anterior teeth after obturation and post space preparation. the specific leakage time in days for each organism to penetrate through the obturating material was determined. in addition, colonization of the apical canal space was assessed by scanning electron microscope after longitudinal splitting of randomly selected specimens.  results: eighty percent of the teeth demonstrated coronal leakage of f. nucleatum and c. rectus by the 90 day interval. bacterial penetration occurred from 48 days to 84 days. scanning electron microscope examination showed a heterogeneous biofilm of coccal and bacillary species colonizing the apical portion of the canal wall. conclusions: this study demonstrated that coronal leakage phenomena do occur after loss of coronal seals. the model system developed using mixed, anaerobic bacterial cultures is more clinically relevant and may be used to assess bacterial penetration through gutta percha obturation.

TI  == dental implant infections.
AB  == dental implants provide a restorative tool to support crowns, bridge abutments, and removable dentures. osseointegrated implants are titanium posts that are surgically implanted in alveolar bone. a tight immobile bond (osseointegration) forms between bone and titanium, and prosthetic and restorative fixtures are attached to the implants. titanium implants differ from natural teeth, which may  make them more susceptible to mechanical stress. a small proportion of implants are not successful and may fail due to infection. the microbiota of implants is similar to that of teeth in similar clinical states. implants that fail because of mechanical stress are colonized by species associated with healthy teeth. infected implants are colonized by subgingival species, including porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter gracilis, streptococcus intermedius, and peptostreptococcus micros. different patients may be colonized by different microbial complexes, indicating that optimal treatment should be directed to the specific infection.

TI  == recently described clinically important anaerobic bacteria: taxonomic aspects and update.
AB  == a new method of identifying bacteria, phylogenetic 16s rrna sequencing, has led to major reorganizations among most genera of anaerobic bacteria. the pigmented prevotella species now comprise seven species including p. nigrescens and p. tannerae; p. intermedia/p. nigrescens-like organisms await inclusion. the former  mitsuokella dentalis and hallella seregens were transferred to prevotella as one  species, p. dentalis. p. enoeca is a new nonpigmenting prevotella. the genus porphyromonas currently includes 11 pigmented species and one nonpigmented species, p. catoniae; p. levii-like and p. endodontalis-like organisms are candidates for the genus. fusobacterium nucleatum currently has five subspecies,  and f. varium includes the former f. pseudonecrophorum. former wolinella recta and wolinella curva now are campylobacter rectus and campylobacter curvus; campylobacter showae is a new species. isolates included in the bile-sensitive former bacteroides gracilis now are campylobacter gracilis; the bile-resistant b. gracilis isolates were transferred to a new genus, sutterella, as s. wadsworthensis. the new actinomyces species include two subspecies of the a. neuii and the a. radingae-a. turicensis complex. the genus eubacterium sensu stricto is represented by e. limosum, and the former e. alactolyticum was reclassified in a new genus, pseudoramibacter, as p. alactolyticus. recent entries include e. saphenum, e. minutum, e. exiguum, e. infirmum, and e. tardum.  a new genus, atopobium houses some former lactobacilli and streptococci. the genus peptostreptococcus also have four new species; p. hydrogenalis, p. lacrimalis, p. lactolyticus, and p. vaginalis.

TI  == increased susceptibility of rag-2 scid mice to dissemination of endodontic infections.
AB  == specific immunity has been implicated in the pathogenesis of periapical lesions,  although the extent to which these mechanisms are actually involved in either protection or destruction of the pulp-periapex complex is yet to be established.  to investigate this question we compared periapical-lesion pathogenesis in rag-2  severe combined immunodeficient (scid) mice with immunocompetent control mice following surgical pulp exposure. in order to equalize the bacterial challenge, an infection protocol using prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus micros, and streptococcus intermedius was devised. the results demonstrated that after infection, the proportion of the root canal flora represented by the four pathogens was almost identical in both groups (39.9 and 42.2% for rag-2 and immunocompetent control mice, respectively). the effects of abrogation of t- and b-cell mechanisms on periapical pathogenesis were then assessed. approximately one-third of the rag-2 mice developed endodontic abscesses, while no immunocompetent controls had abscesses, results which indicated regional dissemination of the infection. a similar incidence of abscesses was found in two additional experiments. abscessed rag-2 teeth had significantly larger periapical lesions than did nonabscessed rag-2 teeth (p < or = 0.05) and exposed immunocompetent controls (p < or = 0.01), whereas nonabscessed rag-2 teeth were not significantly different from those of exposed immunocompetent controls in periapical-lesion size. we conclude that b- and t-cell-mediated immunity protects the host from the dissemination of endodontic infections and that rag-2 mice are more susceptible to infection-induced pulp-periapex destruction.

TI  == beta-lactamase producing bacteria in adult periodontitis.
AB  == in 23 untreated adult periodontitis patients, the occurrence of beta-lactamase producing periodontal bacteria was determined. in addition to non-selective isolation media, selective isolation and growth of beta-lactamase positive subgingival bacterial species was carried out on blood agar plates supplemented with amoxicillin and plates with amoxicillin+clavulanic acid. porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, peptostreptococcus micros, fusobacterium nucleatum, bacteroides forsythus and campylobacter rectus isolates from the non-selective medium were tested for beta-lactamase activity by a nitrocefin disk method (dryslide) and by a laboratory chromogenic nitrocefin-based test. isolates from the amoxicillin plates that were absent on the amoxicillin/clavulanic acid plates were identified and tested for beta-lactamase production. based on the non-selective plates, six  of 23 p. intermedia isolates, 2 of 19 b. forsythus isolates and 3 of 23 f. nucleatum isolates were beta-lactamase positive. the beta-lactamase positive species prevotella loescheii, prevotella buccae, prevotella buccalis and actinomyces spp were recovered from the selective amoxicillin plates. beta-lactamase positive subgingival species were recovered from 17 of 23 patients (74%) but usually comprised low proportions of the subgingival microbiota (range  < 0.01-15%). comparison of the dryslide test and the nitrocefin-based laboratory  test revealed full agreement of test results. beta-lactamase activity in whole subgingival plaque was detected in 12 patient samples (52%). it was concluded that beta-lactamase activity in subgingival bacteria in adult periodontitis is a  common feature. however, since the majority of the samples showed only low-level  enzymatic activity, the clinical relevance of this observation with regard to therapy with unprotected enzyme-susceptible beta-lactams is uncertain, though failure on the other hand, is difficult to rule out when a mechanism of resistance is present. the majority of beta-lactamase positive strains was found  among species of the prevotella genus.

TI  == occurrence of invading bacteria in radicular dentin of periodontally diseased teeth: microbiological findings.
AB  == bacterial invasion in roots of periodontally diseased teeth, which has been recently documented using cultural and microscopic techniques, may be important in the pathogenesis of periodontal disease. the purpose of this investigation was to determine the occurrence and the species of invading bacteria in radicular dentin of periodontally diseased teeth. samples were taken from the middle layer  of radicular dentin of 26 periodontally diseased teeth. 14 healthy teeth were used as controls. dentin samples were cultured anaerobically. the chosen methodology allowed the determination of the numbers of bacteria present in both  deeper and outer part of dentinal tubules, and the bacterial concentration in dentin samples, expressed as colony forming units per mg of tissue (cfu/mg). invading bacteria was detected in 14 (53.8%) samples from periodontally diseased  teeth. the bacterial concentration ranged from 831.84 to 11971.3 cfu/mg (mean+/-standard deviation: 3043.15+/-2763.13). micro-organisms identified included putative periodontal pathogens such as prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, bacteroides forsythus, peptostreptococcus micros and streptococcus intermedius. these findings suggest that radicular dentin could act as bacterial reservoir from which periodontal pathogens can recolonize treated periodontal pockets, contributing to the failure of therapy and recurrence of disease.

TI  == immune response to fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia and other anaerobes in children with acute tonsillitis.
AB  == the number of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria was determined in the saliva of 20 children with acute group a beta-haemolytic streptococcal (gabhs) pharyngo-tonsillitis, and 20 with acute non-gabhs tonsillitis. antibody titres to four gram-negative anaerobic bacilli that reside in the oropharynx (fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) were determined in these and 20 control patients. an average of 8.8 aerobic and anaerobic isolates per patient saliva specimens were found during the acute tonsillitis stage in both groups, and 6.9 (in gabhs tonsillitis) and 5.6 (in non-gabhs tonsillitis) 5-6 weeks later. there were 10- to 1000-fold more bacteria in the acute stages of the inflammation in both gabhs  and non-gabhs groups. these bacteria were staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, peptostreptococcus spp., f. nucleatum, prevotella spp. and porphyromonas spp. significantly higher antibodies levels to  f. nucleatum and p. intermedia were found in the second serum sample of patients  with non-gabhs pharyngo-tonsillitis (p < 0.001) and gabhs tonsillitis (p < 0.05), as compared with their first sample or the levels of antibodies in controls. the  increase in the number of several aerobic and anaerobic bacteria during acute tonsillitis and the increase in antibody levels to f. nucleatum and p. intermedia, known oral pathogens, may suggest a possible pathogenic role for these organisms in acute non-gabhs and gabhs tonsillitis.

TI  == protein degradation by prevotella intermedia and actinomyces meyeri supports the  growth of non-protein-cleaving oral bacteria in serum.
AB  == the proteolytic activities of oral bacteria are thought to play an important role in the aetiology of dental abscesses. bacteria-derived proteases may contribute to tissue destruction, and are likely to impair host defence by degrading immunoglobulins and complement. degraded periodontal tissue and tissue fluid are  likely to constitute essential sources of nutrients in the abscess. tissue fluid, which is derived from serum, is rich in protein and poor in carbohydrate, suggesting that breakdown of protein and fermentation of amino acids is a crucial step to generate energy for growth of the microflora. the number of oral bacterial species that perform hydrolytic cleavage of protein into polypeptides,  the first step in protein degradation, is relatively small compared to the large  majority of peptidase-producing species. in this study, we therefore investigated the growth-promoting effect of proteinase-producing species like prevotella intermedia and actinomyces meyeri on the growth of some non-proteinase producing  bacteria in mixed cultures. we used serum as a substitute for the supposed natural substrate of the abscess microflora. the breakdown of serum proteins was  investigated using capillary electrophoresis. poor growth was found in mono- and  mixed cultures of non-proteinase producing species eubacterium lentum, fusobacterium nucleatum. peptostreptococcus micros, and streptococcus intermedius. the presence of p. intermedia in mixed cultures strongly enhanced growth of these 4 species, according to the hypothesis that the growth of the mixed cultures was peptide-limited. the enhanced growth of p. intermedia in pronase-digested serum indicated peptide-limited growth of this organism in serum, despite its production of proteinase. we found that growth of monocultures of actinomyces meyeri was poor. in contrast, a. meyeri grew well in mixed cultures and its presence stimulated growth of f. nucleatum and p. micros, suggesting a synergistic relationship. the growth of mono- and mixed cultures was investigated using one representative strain of each species. thus, there is a small risk of having selected unique strains. proteinase inhibitors reduced the growth of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella nigrescens, and p. intermedia in trypticase peptone-yeast extract medium with, and without, igg. our study indicated that proteinase-producing organisms play a key role in mixed cultures of oral bacteria in human serum by providing polypeptides for growth. this may explain their association with dental abscesses.

AB  == the aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of sinus aspirates obtained during surgery was compared with culture of samples obtained by endoscopy. six patients with chronic maxillary sinusitis were evaluated. polymicrobial flora was found in all  specimens (two-to-five isolates/sample). a total of 24 isolates (18 anaerobic, five aerobic and one micro-aerophilic) was obtained from sinus aspirates, and 25  isolates (16 anaerobic and nine aerobic) were found in endoscopic specimens. the  predominant organisms were prevotella spp., fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus spp. and staphylococcus spp. concordance in the type and concentration of organisms was found in all cases. sixteen of the 18 anaerobes isolated from sinus aspirates were also found in the concomitant endoscopic sample. five aerobic isolates were found in both sinus aspirates and endoscopic samples and their concentration was similar. however, four aerobic gram-positive  bacteria (<10(4) cfu/sample) were found only in endoscopy samples. this pilot study demonstrates the usefulness of endoscopic aspiration in the isolation of bacteria from chronically infected maxillary sinuses.

TI  == periodontal microflora of hiv infected patients with periodontitis.
AB  == the aim of this study was to determine the microbial profile of periodontal lesions in hiv seropositive patients and to compare it with rapidly progressing periodontal lesions in systemically healthy patients. the subgingival microflora  of 20 cdc ii, 20 cdc iii, 20 cdc iv/v and 20 systemically healthy patients with rapidly progressing periodontitis was examined. four sites with greatest probing  depth in each patient were selected for microbiological sampling. the samples were cultured aerobically and anaerobically for bacterial isolation using selective and non-selective media. isolates were characterized to species level by conventional biochemical tests and various identification kits. the microflora of periodontitis lesions within the three stages of the hiv infection was similar to that of progressing periodontitis in systemically healthy adults including campylobacter rectus, capnocytophaga spp., fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, selenomonas spp. and peptostreptococcus micros. however, hiv seropositive periodontitis lesions harboured a range of exogenous pathogens rarely associated with common types of periodontitis including staphylococcus aureus, enterobacter cloaca, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus avium, clostridium difficile, aspergillus fumigatus, klebsiella pneumoniae and mycoplasma incognitum. the lack of immune effector and regulatory cells in hiv infected patients could in fact explain the increase of some opportunistic pathogens and the characteristic and rapidly progressing nature of the periodontal disease in these patients.

TI  == fungi in therapy-resistant apical periodontitis.
AB  == the occurrence of yeasts in 967 microbiological endodontic samples taken from root canals in persistent endodontic infections was studied. the sampling was done by general practitioners in various parts of finland from root canal infections which did not respond favourably to standard conservative therapy. the samples were cultivated aerobically on a non-selective enriched horse blood agar  medium, on tsbv agar medium in 5% co2 and anaerobically on horse blood agar medium. micro-organisms were found in 692 of the samples while 275 showed no growth. forty-eight fungi were isolated from 47 samples which is 7% of the culture-positive samples. twenty yeast strains were identified further by their colony morphology, growth and cellular characteristics and patterns of carbohydrate assimilation. all isolates except one belonged to the genus candida. candida albicans was the most common species. c. glabrata was found together with c. albicans in one sample. c. guilliermondii, c. inconspicua and geotrichum candidum were each isolated once. yeasts were found in pure culture in six samples and together with bacteria in 41 samples. in all the samples except two,  the accompanying facultative bacteria were gram positive. the most frequent of them were alpha- and non-haemolytic streptococcus species which were found in 31  samples. anaerobic bacteria were isolated together with yeasts from 12 root canals. they included both gram positive species such as peptostreptococcus micros and gram negative species such as fusobacterium nucleatum. the regular isolation of yeasts, also in pure culture, indicates that yeasts may have an important role in cases of apical periodontitis persisting after conventional treatment.

TI  == degradation of lactoferrin by periodontitis-associated bacteria.
AB  == the degradation of human lactoferrin by putative periodontopathogenic bacteria was examined. fragments of lactoferrin were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and measured by densitometry. the degradation of lactoferrin was more extensive by porphyromonas gingivalis and capnocytophaga sputigena, slow by capnocytophaga ochracea, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and prevotella intermedia, and very slow or absent by prevotella nigrescens, campylobacter rectus, campylobacter sputorum, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. nucleatum, capnocytophaga gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus and peptostreptococcus micros. all strains of p. gingivalis tested degraded lactoferrin. the degradation was sensitive to protease inhibitors, cystatin c and albumin. the degradation by c. sputigena was not affected by the protease inhibitors and the detected lactoferrin fragments exhibited electrophoretic mobilities similar to those ascribed to deglycosylated forms of lactoferrin. furthermore a weak or absent reactivity of these fragments with sialic acid-specific lectin suggested that they are desialylated. the present data indicate that certain bacteria colonizing the periodontal pocket can degrade lactoferrin. the presence of other human proteins as specific inhibitors and/or as substrate competitors may counteract this degradation process.

TI  == the adherence of periodontopathogens to periodontal probes. a possible factor in  intra-oral transmission?
AB  == periodontal probes have previously been shown to harbor several bacterial types or species after probing periodontally diseased pockets. this study aims to identify and quantify periodontopathogens that may adhere to a periodontal probe  by culturing techniques. it also examines the probe's roughness on its capability to collect bacteria, comparing merrit-b probes (with deep indentations) with tps  probes (with smooth surfaces). from the differential phase contrast microscopy findings it was seen that, while paper-points harbored nearly 50% motile rods or  spirochetes, the periodontal probes were just at, or below, the 20% threshold level for pathogenicity (23.6% for the merrit-b probe and 11.3% for the tps probe). the cultural data showed that paper-points had significantly higher (p <  0.05) numbers of anaerobic bacteria than the 2 probe types, which still harbored  up to 10(7) cfu. no significant differences could be detected between the probes. when specific periodontopathic species were considered, it was seen that for all  species, even for actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans or porphyromonas gingivalis, the detection frequency was comparable for the 3 sampling devices. however, the levels of prevotella intermedia and campylobacter rectus was significantly higher in samples from paper-points (p < 0.05), but still their numbers reached even 10(5) on the probes. differences among the 2 probe types were again negligible. periodontal probes harbor relatively high numbers of bacteria found in periodontal pockets and may be able to carry them over to other sites. further studies are needed to determine if, and to what extent, transmission occurs during periodontal probing.

TI  == microbiology of the transition from acute to chronic maxillary sinusitis.
AB  == repeated aspirations of sinus secretions by endoscopy was performed in five patients over a period of 34-50 days and, ultimately, surgical drainage was done  in three who presented with acute maxillary sinusitis that did not respond to antimicrobial therapy and became chronic. the aspirates were cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. most of the bacteria isolated from the first culture were aerobic or facultative bacteria: streptococcus pneumoniae (three isolates), haemophilus influenzae non-type-b (two) and moraxella catarrhalis (one). three of these cultures yielded bacteria that were resistant to the antimicrobial agents prescribed for treatment. failure to respond to therapy was associated with the emergence of resistant aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in subsequent aspirates. these organisms included fusobacterium nucleatum, pigmented prevotella and porphyromonas spp. and peptostreptococcus spp. eradication of the infection was achieved in all instances following the administration of antimicrobial agents effective against these bacteria, and in three instances by surgical drainage. this study illustrates the microbial dynamics of maxillary sinusitis that did not respond to antimicrobial therapy.

TI  == electrophoresis of whole-cell soluble proteins of microorganisms isolated from bacteremias in endodontic therapy.
AB  == we have previously demonstrated that anaerobic bacteria are the microorganisms most frequently isolated from blood following endodontic therapy of teeth with apical periodontitis. phenotypic characterisation of the isolates suggested that  the bacteria in the blood originated from the root canal. the present experiment  using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) was carried out in an effort to verify these findings, and to further study the microorganisms involved in endodontic bacteremias. soluble cellular proteins were extracted from 11 reference strains and 26 bacterial isolates recovered from the  root canal and blood. these included propionibacterium acnes, peptostreptococcus  prevotii, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia. actinomyces israelii, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus sanguis. the electrophoretic patterns mostly confirmed the identity of the isolates as determined by the biochemical and antimicrobial resistance tests. furthermore, with this typing method the species prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens could be differentiated.  these species had been recovered from both root canal and blood. also, differences between subspecies of fusobacterium nucleatum became evident with sds-page, and the results indicated that the organism recovered from the root canal and blood was fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. vincentii. the electrophoretic patterns of the different organisms isolated from the root canal and the blood were similar, providing further evidence that the bacteria found in the blood originated from the root canal.

AB  == bacterial proteases may participate in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases through their action on host proteins. in the present study, the ability of selected periodontopathogens, as well as two proteases isolated from porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola, to degrade host protease inhibitors was evaluated. the activation of human plasminogen by the two bacterial proteases was also investigated. proteolytic breakdown of host protease inhibitors (alpha-1-antitrypsin, antichymotrypsin, alpha 2-macroglobulin, antithrombin iii, antiplasmin and cystatin c) was evaluated by sds-page. the 80 kda trypsin-like protease of p. gingivalis completely digested the six protease inhibitors under investigation, whereas the 95 kda chymotrypsin-like protease of  t. denticola was slightly less active, more particularly on alpha 2-macroglobulin and cystatin c. when whole cells from a number of oral bacterial species were tested, the most significant degradation was obtained with p. gingivalis, t. denticola, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and capnocytophaga spp. peptostreptococcus micros and propionibacterium acnes had only some degradative activity on selected inhibitors, whereas three bacterial species, actinobacillus  actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus and fusobacterium nucleatum, had no  effect on the protease inhibitors. the 80 kda protease of p. gingivalis demonstrated strong plasminogen activation, whereas no such activity was associated with the 95 kda protease of t. denticola. this study indicates the high potential of some periodontal pathogens to destroy protease inhibitors and activate plasminogen. this may result in an uncontrolled degradation of periodontal tissues and a rapid progression of the disease.

TI  == response to periodontal therapy in patients with high or low levels of p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, p. nigrescens and b. forsythus.
AB  == in a previous study, subjects receiving either adjunctive tetracycline or augmentin showed, on average, more attachment level gain 10 months post-therapy than subjects receiving either ibuprofen or a placebo, although some subjects in  each treatment group showed loss of attachment post-therapy. since differences in treatment response might have been due to differences in the subgingival microbiota, the response to different therapies in subjects with different pre-therapy subgingival microbiotas was evaluated. 29 subjects exhibiting loss of attachment > 2.5 mm at 1 or more sites during longitudinal monitoring were treated by modified widman flap surgery at deep sites, subgingival scaling at all other sites and were randomly assigned one of the following agents: augmentin, tetracycline, ibuprofen or a placebo. treatment was completed within 30 days, during which time the subject took the assigned agent. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial surface of each tooth at each visit and evaluated for  their content of 14 subgingival species including p. gingivalis, p. nigrescens, p. intermedia and b. forsythus using dna probes. 18 subjects with mean counts > 10(5) of 2 or more of these 4 species comprised the high test species group; 11 subjects with mean counts > 10(5) of 0 or 1 of the species, the low test species  group. because this was a post-hoc analysis, the number of subjects in some of the treatment/test species groups was small. however, the 8 high test species subjects who received tetracycline showed the most attachment level gain (0.83 +/- 0.20 mm), while the 3 tetracycline-treated, low test species subjects showed  minimal gain (0.05 +/- 0.28 mm) 10 months post-therapy. low test species subjects receiving augmentin (n = 2) showed a mean gain in attachment of 0.67 (+/- 0.59) mm. the mean % of sites showing either attachment gain or loss > or = 2 mm was computed for each treatment/test species group. high test species subjects receiving tetracycline exhibited the best ratio of gaining to losing sites (16.2), followed by low test species subjects receiving augmentin (14.1). periodontal pockets < 7 mm pre-therapy in low test species subjects treated with  augmentin and high test species subjects treated with tetracycline showed attachment gain more frequently than attachment loss. the greatest proportion of  gaining sites was seen at pockets > 6 mm, particularly in subjects receiving adjunctive tetracycline. overall, the data indicated that a gain in mean attachment level post-therapy was significantly associated (p < 0.001) with an increase in c. ochracea accompanied by a decrease in b. forsythus, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia and p. nigrescens. the 4 test species were decreased more in subjects receiving tetracycline. in contrast, augmentin appeared to be effective  in decreasing the % sites colonized by a. actinomycetemcomitans and in increasing the proportion of sites colonized by c. ochracea. knowledge of the baseline microbiota should improve the choice of an appropriate adjunctive antibiotic for  periodontal therapy.

TI  == associations of endodontic symptoms and signs with particular combinations of specific bacteria.
AB  == significant associations have been reported between (a) specific bacterial species isolated from root canals and (b) between individual bacterial species and endodontic symptoms and signs. the prime objective of this study was to determine whether particular combinations of specific bacteria are associated with individual endodontic symptoms and signs. seventy root canals were investigated microbiologically taking care to maintain the viability of obligate  anaerobes, which accounted for 64% of the total species isolated, including peptostreptococcus micros, prevotella melaninogenica, prevotella oralis, eubacterium aerofaciens, eubacterium lentum, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella  buccae and prevotella intermedia. significant associations were found between individual clinical features and the following pairs of species: (a) pain (37 cases) and peptostreptococcus spp./prevotella spp., peptostreptococcus spp./prevotella melaninogenica, pstr. micros/prev. melaninogenica (all p < 0.01); (b) swelling (23 cases) and pstr. micros/prevotella spp. (p < 0.01); (c) 'wet' canal (57 cases) and prevotella spp./eubacterium spp. (p < 0.01), peptostreptococcus spp./eubacterium spp. (p < 0.05). thus data from this investigation suggests that statistically significant associations exist between  individual endodontic symptoms and signs and particular combinations of specific  bacteria.

TI  == comparison of spiral gradient endpoint and agar dilution methods for susceptibility testing of anaerobic bacteria: a multilaboratory collaborative evaluation.
AB  == a multilaboratory collaborative study was carried out to assess the utility of the spiral gradient endpoint (sge) method for the determination of the antimicrobial susceptibilities of anaerobes and to evaluate the equivalence of the mics obtained by the sge method with those obtained by the reference agar dilution method of the national committee for clinical laboratory standards. the  standard deviation of the mic obtained by the sge method for the five participating laboratories was +/- 0.26 of a twofold dilution, whereas it was +/- 1 twofold dilution by the reference method. the interlaboratory reproducibility of the results for two control strains tested with imipenem, chloramphenicol, and metronidazole indicated that 96% of the measurements fell within +/- 1 twofold dilution of the mode. the equivalence of the sge method with the agar dilution method was assessed with a wide variety of anaerobic organisms. the mics by both  methods were within 1 doubling dilution in 93% of the measurements (n = 1,074). discrepancies generally occurred with those organism-drug combinations that resulted in tailing endpoints (fusobacterium nucleatum, 86% agreement) or in cases of light growth (peptostreptococcus spp., 86% agreement).

TI  == aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of superficial suppurative thrombophlebitis.
AB  == objective: to study the aerobic and anaerobic microbiologic characteristics of superficial suppurative thrombophlebitis. design: retrospective review of microbiologic and clinical data. setting: navy hospital in bethesda, md. results: sixty-one isolates, 36 aerobic and 25 anaerobic, were isolated from samples obtained from 42 patients. aerobic bacteria only were found in 26 (62%) patients; anaerobic only, in 11 (26%); and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, in five (12%). the predominant aerobic bacteria were staphylococcus aureus (n = 9), escherichia coli (n = 7), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 4), and klebsiella sp (n =  3). the most frequently recovered anaerobic bacteria were peptostreptococcus sp (n = 8), propionibacterium acnes (n = 6), bacteroides fragilis group (n = 5), prevotella intermedia (n = 3), and fusobacterium nucleatum (n = 3). propionibacterium acnes and peptostreptococcus sp were associated with cannula-related superficial suppurative thrombophlebitis; b fragilis and enterobacteriaceae, with abdominal surgery or pathology; and s aureus and p aeruginosa and citrobacter sp, with burns. conclusion: these data illustrate the  importance of anaerobic bacteria in superficial suppurative thrombophlebitis.

TI  == competition for peptides and amino acids among periodontal bacteria.
AB  == we recently studied the utilization of glutathione (l-gamma-glutamyl-l-cysteinylglycine), l-cysteinylglycine and l-cysteine by anaerobic bacteria. the rate of hydrogen sulfide formation from these compounds was determined and it was concluded that peptostreptococcus micros and fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. nucleatum had an active transport of small peptides. in the present study it is shown that methyl mercaptan formation from l-methionine and l-methionyl-containing peptides can also be used to study peptide utilization. there were differences among the periodontal bacteria p. micros, f. nucleatum subsp. nucleatum, and porphyromonas gingivalis in their capacity to use l-cysteine and l-methionine and peptides containing these amino acids. the peptides were used more efficiently by p. micros and f. nucleatum subsp. nucleatum than by p. gingivalis. all three species used the peptides more  efficiently than the free amino acids. the efficiency in utilizing various amino  acids and peptides may be among the key determinants of the periodontal microbial ecology.

TI  == endodontic pathogens: propagation of infection through patent dentinal tubules in traumatized monkey teeth.
AB  == periapical pathology indicating endodontic infection, when present in marginal periodontitis-affected teeth, has recently been shown to be an aggravating factor in progression of marginal destruction. this has been associated with patency of  dentinal tubules in the tooth cervix, an area normally devoid of cementum following periodontal therapy. these studies are, however hampered by that only circumstantial evidence such as presence of periapical destruction have been applied as criteria of endodontic infection. the purpose of the present investigation was to study to what extent a predefined selection of endodontic pathogens inoculated in the root canal can influence periodontal pathology and healing in areas of the root covered by or devoid of cementum, using root resorption as a histomorphometric marker. exposed dentine surfaces, in the present study showed significantly larger areas of resorption in infected roots compared to non-infected roots, while cementum surfaces showed an almost identical distribution of tissue reactions regardless of root canal infection or  not. it was concluded that endodontic pathogens or their products were not able to penetrate the cementum barrier. the significantly larger areas of resorption on exposed dentine surfaces in infected roots compared to non-infected roots indicated that endodontic pathogens or their products could spread through dentinal tubules to a root surface void of cementum. extrapolated to the marginal situation this indicated that endodontic pathogens in the root canal might be able to aggravate marginal infection in areas of root devoid of cementum.

TI  == endodontic pathogens in periodontal disease augmentation.
AB  == periapical pathology indicating endodontic infection, when present in periodontitis-affected teeth, has recently been shown to be correlated to marginal periodontal breakdown. this has been associated with patency of dentinal tubules in the tooth cervix, an area normally devoid of cementum following periodontal therapy. these studies are, however hampered by that only circumstantial evidence such as presence of periapical destruction have been applied as criteria of endodontic infection. the aim of the present investigation was to assess the effects of endodontic pathogens on marginal periodontal wound healing on root surfaces devoid of cementum but surrounded by healthy periodontal membrane. significant differences between infected and non-infected teeth were found with respect to pathological pocket and connective tissue: the experimental defects were covered by approximately 20% more pocket epithelium in infected teeth while defects in non-infected teeth showed approximately 10% more connective tissue coverage. it was concluded, that an intra-canal infection of endodontic pathogens stimulates epithelial downgrowth along denuded dentin surfaces with marginal communication. extrapolated to the clinical situation, endodontic infections in periodontitis-prone patients may augment periodontitis propagation.

TI  == antibacterial effects of some root end filling materials.
AB  == in addition to having good sealing ability, root end filling materials should "ideally" have some antibacterial activity to prevent bacterial growth. this investigation compared the antibacterial effects of amalgam, zinc oxide-eugenol,  super eba and a mineral trioxide aggregate on nine facultative bacteria streptococcus fecalis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, lactobacillus species, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, bacillus subtilis, and escherichia coli b and seven strict anaerobic bacteria, prevotella (bacteroides) buccae, bacteroides fragilis, prevotella (bacteroides) intermedia, prevotella (bacteroides) melaninogenica, fusobacterium  necrophorum, fusobacterium nucleatum, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius. after growing these bacteria on solid media, freshly mixed and 24-h set test materials  were placed on the surface of these inoculated media and incubated in the appropriate atmosphere for 24 to 48 h at 37 degrees c. impregnated discs with the super eba liquid were used as positive controls. the antibacterial effects of each material were measured in millimeters and the data were analyzed using one-way and two-way analysis of variance and scheffe tests to determine the statistical differences between the antibacterial effects of the test materials.  impregnated discs with super eba liquid caused varying degrees of growth inhibition for both facultative and strict anaerobic bacteria. both types of amalgam had no antibacterial effect against any of the bacteria tested in this study. mineral trioxide aggregate had an antibacterial effect on some of the facultative bacteria and no effect on any of the strict anaerobic bacteria. zinc  oxide-eugenol and super eba pastes had some antibacterial effects on both types of bacteria tested.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == relationship between salivary blood group antigens, microbial flora and periodontal condition in young adults.
AB  == to investigate a possible role for salivary blood-group antigens in the relative  frequencies of selected periodontal pathogens and commensal oral micro-organisms, we studied the clinical and microbiological condition in young adults with or without blood group reactive substances in saliva (secretors or non-secretors respectively). clinical measurements were recorded at the ramfjord teeth in 81 1st-year dental students. in addition, presence of interproximal loss of attachment (la) was assessed at sites with a pocket depth of > or = 4 mm. microbiological samples were taken from one of the ramfjord teeth (site without interproximal la), from interproximal sites of > or = 4 mm in conjunction with la, and from the saliva. the samples were analyzed for the presence of actinomyces naeslundii, actinomyces viscosus, campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus micros, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. clinically, no statistically significant differences were found in the periodontal status between secretors (78% of our population) and non-secretors. furthermore, the occurrence of the monitored micro-organisms was not correlated to the secretor status. it is concluded that bacterial colonization with the micro-organisms tested in this study, apparently occurred independent of secretor status. among the periodontal  pathogens, only p. intermedia was more frequently recovered from the saliva of subjects with interproximal la (49%) than in those without (33%; p = 0.03). this  finding was irrespective of the secretor status. therefore, p. intermedia may be  an important micro-organism in relation to the onset of periodontal destruction in young adults.

AB  == the vaginal microflora of 49 women in idiopathic preterm labor was compared with  that of 38 term controls to determine whether the presence of bacterial vaginosis (bv) and/or specific microorganisms would influence the rate of preterm delivery. demographic factors, pregnancy outcome, and reproductive history were also studied. bv, as defined by the presence of clue cells in a vaginal wet mount and  characteristic microbial findings in a stained vaginal smear and vaginal culture, was more common in women with preterm labor and delivery than in controls (p < 0.01). the condition, diagnosed in 41% of women who had both preterm labor and delivery (n = 22) and in 11% each of women who had preterm labor but term delivery (n = 27) and controls, was associated with a 2.1-fold risk (95% confidence intervals, 1.2 to 3.7) for preterm birth prior to 37 weeks of gestation. bv was associated with low birth weight. of 49 women with preterm labor, 67% (8 of 12) of women with bv were delivered of low-birth-weight neonates (< 2,500 g) compared with 22% (8 of 37) of women without the condition (p < 0.0005). the presence of hydrogen peroxide-producing facultative lactobacillus spp. was strongly negatively associated with both preterm delivery and bv. bv-associated microorganisms, i.e., mobiluncus, prevotella, and peptostreptococcus species, porphyromonas asaccharolytica, fusobacterium nucleatum, mycoplasma hominis, and high numbers of gardnerella vaginalis were significantly associated with preterm delivery; all species also strongly associated with bv (p = 0.0001 for each comparison). mobiluncus curtisii and fusobacterium nucleatum were recovered exclusively from women with preterm delivery. our study clearly indicates that bv and its associated organisms are correlated with idiopathic premature delivery.

TI  == a quantitative comparison of selected bacteria in human carious dentine by microscopic counts.
AB  == the levels of selected cariogenic and obligately anaerobic bacteria have been compared in carious dentine taken from fissures, smooth surfaces, and root surfaces. the numbers of infected dentinal tubules were determined by immunohistological staining using species-specific antisera against selected bacteria. selective localization was observed; mutans streptococci were the predominant bacteria in dentine from fissures and smooth surface coronal caries,  but not from root surface caries. the proportion of mutans streptococci was higher in the shallow and middle layers of dentine from fissures and smooth surface coronal carious lesions than from the deep layers. in root surface caries, actinomyces spp. were the predominant bacteria, and were present at higher levels in the deep layer of root lesions than in the shallow and middle layers. the proportion of lactobacillus spp. was relatively low despite its high  detection frequency in all layers of the three types of carious lesion. immunohistological staining with species-specific antisera was able to reveal the distribution and the localization of various bacteria in carious dentine.

TI  == positive and negative associations between bacterial species in dental root canals.
AB  == significant associations have been previously reported between certain pairs of bacterial species isolated from human dental root canals. the aim of this study was to examine microbiologically a more extensive series of cases, with particular reference to obligate anaerobes which accounted for 64% of total isolations. a total of 65 different species was isolated and individual root canals yielded a maximum of eleven bacterial species. highly significant positive associations (p < 0.001) were found between peptostreptococcus spp. and prevotella spp., between peptostreptococcus spp. and p. melaninogenica, between p. micros and prevotella spp., p. micros and p. melaninogenica and between prevotella spp. and eubacterium spp., all with an odds ratio of > 9.0. in contrast, negative and highly significant associations (p < 0.01) were found only between the four species pairs: b. vulgatus/f. necrophorum, p. magnus/bifidobacterium spp., b. gracilis/f. nucleatum and between b. gracilis/fusobacterium spp.; all with an odds ratio of < 0.5. some previously published associations were confirmed and some new associations were found, while some negative associations became apparent.

TI  == [cytotoxicity of anaerobic bacteria isolated from infected root canal].
AB  == bacteria in the infected root canal play an important role in the progression of  the periapical lesion. the purpose of the present study was to investigate the cytotoxic effects of bacteria isolated from an infected root canal on the periapical lesion. four obligately anaerobic bacteria were isolated and their sonic extracts (se) were prepared. the cytotoxic assay of each se for mc3t3-e1 cell was used with respect to the morphological cell changes and [3h]-thymidine uptake. the following results were obtained: 1. four obligately anaerobic bacteria were identified as follows: porphyromonas asaccharolytica (p. a.), fusobacterium nucleatum (f. n.), eubacterium lentum (e. l.), and peptostreptococcus micros (p. m.). 2. the protein concentrations which induced the morphological cell changes differed in each se. the se from p. m. caused cell abnormalities at 10 micrograms protein/ml, f. n. and e. l., at 30 micrograms protein/ml, and p. a., at 100 micrograms protein/ml. 3. the inhibition of the incorporation of [3h]-thymidine into dna was concentration-dependent. the se of p. a. showed less cytotoxicity than the others at lower concentrations; 3, 10, 30 micrograms protein/ml. the se from f. n. had more cytotoxicity at higher concentrations; 100, 300 micrograms protein/ml. these results suggest that these  bacterial sonic extracts have a potential to cause morphological cell changes and inhibit the cell proliferation in different concentrations.

TI  == role of suspected periodontopathogens in microbiological monitoring of periodontitis.
AB  == periodontal disease is the clinical result of a complex interaction between the host and plaque bacteria. although a specificity to some degree is found for actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans in localized juvenile periodontitis (ljp), it has been difficult to obtain evidence for a specific etiological role of the bacteria associated with periodontal disease in adults. what we see is the net result of host-parasite interactions which in an unpredictable moment accumulate  and exceed the threshold of tissue integrity. this hypothesis is concomitant with the view of periodontal disease as a polymicrobial infection, predominantly anaerobic, which occurs commonly in the oral cavity or elsewhere in the body. some micro-organisms (risk markers) occur more frequently than others and may significantly determine the outcome of this host-parasite interaction. microbiological sampling and analysis seem to be of limited value in risk assessment; however, they can be used as tools in diagnosis in ljp patients and acute infections, and in treatment decision and therapy control in "refractory" patients. suspected pathogens (risk markers) are actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and some species of spirochetes, while the roles of prevotella intermedia, bacteroidesforsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, and peptostreptococcus micros are more uncertain. the presence of periodontopathogens as well as enterics, staphylococcus aureus and candida especially, should be considered in patients with systemic individual disorders--e.g., diabetes mellitus, neutropenia, agranulocytosis, and aids--or with implants.

TI  == oral and dental infections with anaerobic bacteria: clinical features, predominant pathogens, and treatment.
AB  == microbial populations colonizing the teeth are a major source of pathogens responsible for oral and dental infections, including periodontal diseases, gingivitis, pericoronitis, endodontitis, peri-implantitis, and postextraction infections. each entity has distinct clinical and microbial features. bacterial species associated with oral infections include actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, bacteroides forsythus, campylobacter rectus, eubacterium species, fusobacterium nucleatum, eikenella corrodens, and peptostreptococcus micros. treponema pallidum-related spirochetes have been associated with acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis. porphyromonas endodontalis appears to be specifically related to endodontic infections. oral infections in medically compromised patients, including those with aids, are associated with similar species and are  usually complicated by superinfection with enteric and candida species. isolation of species causing oral infections requires the collection of appropriate samples and the use of strictly anaerobic techniques. rapid selective culture, immunofluorescence, and dna probe methods have been developed for the identification of these oral species. the varied measures required in the management of oral and dental infections may include antimicrobial therapy. accurate microbiological diagnosis, including antibiotic susceptibility testing,  is indicated for cases that do not respond to therapy.

TI  == peritonsillar abscess, retropharyngeal abscess, mediastinitis, and nonclostridial anaerobic myonecrosis: a case report.
AB  == peritonsillar abscess is a potentially life-threatening complication of acute tonsillitis. on occasion, peritonsillar abscess can extend to neck spaces and/or  to the mediastinum. we describe a case of a patient with a peritonsillar abscess  that extended to the neck, producing bilateral retropharyngeal abscesses and myonecrosis of the strap muscles. culture of a specimen of the necrotic muscle yielded prevotella intermedia, prevotella buccae, lactobacillus catenaforme, another lactobacillus species, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and some nonanaerobes. culture of the peritonsillar abscess yielded p. intermedia and p. buccae plus p. anaerobius, peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, bifidobacterium dentium, viridans and group f streptococci, and citrobacter diversus. culture of  the retropharyngeal abscess yielded fusobacterium nucleatum and actinomyces odontolyticus in addition to most of the aforementioned organisms. the patient underwent repeated drainage and debridement procedures and was treated with various antimicrobial agents and ultimately recovered. this case highlights the polymicrobial nature of peritonsillar abscess and the serious complications that  this infection may lead to.

TI  == bacteriologic findings in peritonsillar abscesses in young adults.
AB  == aspirated pus samples from 124 patients with peritonsillar abscess were cultured  quantitatively for aerobes and anaerobes. a total of 98% of the samples yielded bacteria. of the 550 isolates obtained (mean, 4.4 per patient), 143 were aerobes  (representing 16 species or groups) and 407 were anaerobes (representing 40 species or groups). aerobes were isolated from 86% of patients-alone in 20 cases  and together with anaerobes in 87. the most common aerobic isolates were streptococcus pyogenes (isolated from 45% of patients), streptococcus milleri group organisms (27%), haemophilus influenzae (11%), and viridans streptococci (11%). anaerobes were isolated from 82% of the samples and as a sole finding from 15 abscesses. fusobacterium necrophorum and prevotella melaninogenica were both isolated from 38% of patients, prevotella intermedia from 32%, peptostreptococcus micros from 27%, fusobacterium nucleatum from 26%, and actinomyces odontolyticus  from 23%. the rate of previous tonsillar/peritonsillar infections was lowest (25%) among patients infected with s. pyogenes and highest (52%) among those infected with f. necrophorum (p < .01). recurrences and/or related tonsillectomies were more common among patients infected with f. necrophorum than among those infected with s. pyogenes (57% vs. 19%; p < .0001) or with s. milleri group organisms (43% vs. 19%; p < .05). beta-lactamase was produced by only 38% of the 73 isolates of prevotella species tested; however, 56% of the 36 patients  studied harbored one or more such strains.

TI  == the normal vaginal flora, h2o2-producing lactobacilli, and bacterial vaginosis in pregnant women.
AB  == in this study of the vaginal flora of 171 pregnant women in labor at term, the flora was categorized as normal (lactobacillus predominant), intermediate, or representative of bacterial vaginosis (bv) on the basis of a vaginal smear. bv was diagnosed in 39 women (23%); the vaginal flora was classified as normal in 50% of cases and as intermediate in 27%. h2o2-producing lactobacilli were recovered from 5% of women with bv, 37% of those with an intermediate flora, and  61% of those with a normal flora. h2o2-negative lactobacilli were equally frequent (57%-65%) in all three groups. the microorganisms most frequently recovered from women with bv included gardnerella vaginalis, prevotella bivia/disiens, bacteroides ureolyticus, prevotella corporis/bacteroides levii, fusobacterium nucleatum, mobiluncus species, peptostreptococcus prevotii, peptostreptococcus tetradius, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, viridans streptococci, ureaplasma urealyticum, and mycoplasma hominis (p < .05 for each).  the presence of all but three of these organisms was inversely related to vaginal colonization by h2o2-producing lactobacilli; the exceptions were b. ureolyticus,  f. nucleatum, and p. prevotii. other microorganisms were equally frequent among women with and without bv. we conclude that specific groups of anaerobes are associated with bv in this population and that a strong association exists between species associated with bv and those inhibited by h2o2-producing lactobacilli.

TI  == the influence of race and gender on periodontal microflora.
AB  == previous studies have demonstrated that demographic characteristics of subject populations influence both the incidence of periodontal diseases and various aspects of host responses to periodontal bacteria. in this study we analyzed the  components of the subgingival microflora from individuals with adult periodontitis, early onset periodontitis, gingivitis, and periodontal health as a function of gender and race (black and white). clinical categories were analyzed  individually so that there were no differences in the clinical characteristics of the sampled sites. no significant differences were noted in the subgingival microflora between males and females. when either the first two bacterial samples from each subject or all bacterial samples taken from each subject were included  in the analysis, it was found that porphyromonas gingivalis was more significantly associated with black subjects in the adult periodontitis group. when all samples were considered in the analysis, it was found that peptostreptococcus anaerobius was associated with black subjects in the adult periodontitis group, while fusobacterium nucleatum was associated with white subjects in both the adult periodontitis and early onset periodontitis groups. thus a limited number of important bacterial components of the subgingival microflora are influenced by the race and diagnosis of the subject group.

AB  == the macaca mulatta species of rhesus monkey is one of several non-human primate (nhp) models for periodontal disease. this report presents the bacteriology of the gingival sulci in m. mulatta monkeys. three sub-gingival sites (maxillary right central incisor, the disto-buccal of the mandibular left second molar and mesio-buccal of the mandibular right second molar) of 9 monkeys were evaluated clinically before scaling and 7 days after scaling. plaque samples were obtained  from sub-gingival sites before clinical examination and studied bacteriologically by dark field microscopy, selective and non-selective culture, and by primary phenotypic characterizations of culture isolates. several gingival sites presented with mild gingival inflammation. anaerobic and facultatively anaerobic  bacteria were the predominant flora colonizing the gingival sulci. the major microbial groups were haemophilus species (100% of sites; percentage of total anaerobic count (tac): 21-51), peptostreptococcus micros (89%, 7.5-29.5), actinomyces sp. (85%, 7-27), fusobacterium nucleatum (90%, 5-8), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (73%, 1.3-12), black-pigmented anaerobic rods (bpar) (80%,  0.6-6.5) and oral streptococci (80%, 0.2-1.0). microbial groups detected less often were wolinella sp. (66%, 0-2.6), capnocytophaga sp. (30%), eikenella corrodens (4.7%, 0), campylobacter sp. (28%, 0-0.1) and spirochetes (4.7%, 0-0.07). seven days after gingival sites were scaled, the plaque score and indices for gingival inflammation declined significantly. the gingival flora after scaling were characterized by lower proportions of the actinomyces sp., p.  micros and bpar; and increased proportions of the oral streptococci, relative to  pre-scaling levels.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == the existence of commensal or antagonistic relationships between microorganisms in the root canals of teeth with apical periodontitis was investigated. samples were taken from 65 infected human root canals and were analysed according to species, frequency of occurrence and proportion of the total isolated flora. the  most frequent species were fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia, peptostreptococcus micros, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, eubacterium alactolyticum, eubacterium lentum and wolinella recta. an odds ratio system was used to calculate positive or negative associations between the isolated bacteria. strong positive associations were found between f. nucleatum and p. micros, porphyromonas endodontalis, selenomonas sputigena and w. recta. there was also a positive association between p. intermedia and p. micros, p. anaerobius and the eubacteria. in general, species of streptococci, propionibacterium propionica, capnocytophaga ochracea and veillonella parvula showed no or negative associations with the other bacteria. the results are consistent with the concept of a special and selective environment occurring in the root canal that is due, in part, to the cooperative as well as antagonistic nature of the relationships between bacteria in the root canal.

AB  == the relationship between the level of subgingival species at baseline and subsequent attachment loss in a subject was examined. 38 subjects (14-71 years) with prior evidence of periodontal destruction were monitored 2x for pocket depth and attachment level at 6 sites per tooth at baseline and 2 months. a subject was considered to exhibit new attachment loss if 1 or more sites increased 3 mm or more in attachment level in 2 months. subgingival plaque samples were taken at the baseline visit from the mesial aspect of each tooth (28 sites) using gracey curettes. samples were dispersed, diluted and plated on trypticase soy agar supplemented with 5% sheep blood. after 7 days of anaerobic incubation, the colonies were lifted onto nylon filters, lysed and the dna fixed to the filters.  digoxygenin-labeled dna probes were used to enumerate 14 subgingival species. 17  of 38 subjects (44.7%) exhibited new attachment loss in 2 months. the % of the total viable count of each species was averaged for each subject. the species enumerated and the mean % of the total cultivable microbiota averaged across the  active and inactive subjects were as follows; b gingivalis 2.3, 1.2; w. recta 1.3, 0.6; b. intermedius i 2.5, 2.0; b. forsythus 1.5, 1.2; a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype a 1.1, 0.8; f. nucleatum ss vincentii 1.1, 1.0; s. intermedius 2.0, 1.9; p. micros 1.5, 1.5; b. intermedius ii 1.6, 1.7; a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b 0.4, 0.6; s. sanguis i 1.8, 2.1; s. sanguis ii 2.7, 3.0; v. parvula 3.9, 4.2; c. ochracea 0.9, 1.8.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == predominant cultivable flora in pericoronitis.
AB  == the predominant cultivable flora in pericoronitis was investigated by culturing pus from affected sites in 20 patients. twenty colonies were picked at random from non-selective plates and identified using conventional biochemical and physiological tests, analysis of metabolic end-products by gas chromatography and protein profile analysis. the most frequently isolated organisms were prevotella  (bacteroides) intermedia, peptostreptococcus micros, veillonella species, fusobacterium nucleatum and streptococcus mitis. porphyromonas (bacteroides) gingivalis was not isolated and asaccharolytic eubacterium species were virtually absent. the predominant cultivable microflora in pericoronitis was found to be highly anaerobic in nature and superficially similar to that found in chronic periodontitis, although proposed marker organisms of severe periodontitis were absent.

TI  == protein-kinase-c-independent activation of arachidonate release and prostaglandin e2 formation in macrophages interacting with certain bacteria.
AB  == certain bacterial species, of which we selected fusobacterium nucleatum, gardnerella vaginalis, peptostreptococcus anaerobius and propionibacterium acnes, were found to induce release of arachidonic acid in a dose- and time-dependent manner in mouse macrophages. the release of arachidonic acid showed a characteristic lag period of approximately 10 min and was accompanied by selective transformation into prostaglandin e2. bacteria killed by various methods caused a similar response, indicating that bacterial surface structures rather than secreted products were involved. down-regulation of protein kinase c  by treatment of macrophages with 4 beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate hardly affected the response to bacteria at all, except for a partial inhibition in the  case of p. acnes. furthermore, the generation of prostaglandin e2 was synergistically enhanced when macrophages were exposed to both bacteria and phorbol ester. it is also unlikely that bacterial activation was mediated exclusively via a rise in cytosolic [ca2+], since bacteria stimulated the release of arachidonic acid also when [ca2+] was clamped at various levels and since the  response to bacteria was enhanced in an additive to synergistic manner when combined with calcium ionophore. changes in protein phosphorylation in macrophages exposed to f. nucleatum (gram-negative) were virtually identical to those seen with bacterial lipopolysaccharide, while p. anaerobius (gram-positive) induced enhanced labeling of a single detectable phosphoprotein. in both cases, the changes in protein phosphorylation showed a time lag of 4-8 min and occurred  independently of protein kinase c, consistent with a possible role in signal transduction. these results demonstrate that certain bacteria cause activation of arachidonic acid release and prostaglandin e2 formation in mouse macrophages; that the response is independent of protein kinase c and that it is not wholly mediated via a rise in cytosolic [ca2+].

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of cefpodoxime against anaerobes other than bacteroides fragilis.
AB  == to assess the in vitro activity of cefpodoxime against anaerobic respiratory tract and oropharyngeal pathogens 77 strains belonging to 18 gram-negative and 7  gram-positive species were studied by means of agar dilution tests. for comparison cefuroxime, amoxicillin, amoxicillin + clavulanic acid and clindamycin were also tested. cefpodoxime was found to be active at concentrations of less than or equal to 0.125 mg/l against prevotella oralis, prevotella buccalis, prevotella bivia, porphyromonas asaccharolytica, bacteroides corporis, bacteroides gracilis, fusobacterium necrophorum, fusobacterium naviforme and propionibacterium acnes. prevotella oris, prevotella buccae, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, and ruminococcus bromii were inhibited at concentrations of less than or equal to 1 mg/l and prevotella denticola, prevotella melaninogenica, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides pneumosintes, and peptostreptococcus micros at concentrations of less than or equal to 4 mg/l. strains of veillonella parvula were inhibited by cefpodoxime at 0.25-8 mg/l, and single strains of peptostreptococcus anaerobius and peptostreptococcus magnus showed mics of 32 and 64 mg/l, respectively. the results obtained warrant the use of cefpodoxime in therapy of anaerobic and mixed aerobic-anaerobic infections of the upper and lower respiratory tract and similar infections not involving bacteroides fragilis.

TI  == subgingival microflora of advanced periodontitis in the dominican republic.
AB  == a study of the predominant subgingival microflora was carried out in 24 periodontitis patients, 18 to 60 years of age, in santo domingo, dominican republic. paper point sampling, transport in vmga iii, and conventional microbiological techniques were utilized. direct microscopic examination revealed that cocci and nonmotile organisms made up 85% of the total organisms and spirochetes as little as 3%. nonselective culturing showed gram-negative organisms to constitute 53% of total isolates. fusobacterium nucleatum averaged 15%, black-pigmented anaerobes 7%, and peptostreptococcus micros 10% of the cultivable microflora. enteric rods and acinetobacter species were recovered from 16 patients and comprised 23% of the cultivable flora. enterobacter cloacae occurred in 8 patients, klebsiella oxytoca in 3 patients, and 7 other species in  10 patients. parallel studies have found a significantly lower prevalence of enteric rods in advanced periodontitis patients in the usa. in conclusion, fewer  spirochetes and markedly more enteric rods seem to inhabit adult periodontitis lesions in santo domingo patients compared to those in usa. high levels of subgingival enteric rods in periodontitis patients in santo domingo may have important prophylactic and therapeutic implications.

TI  == reactivity of igg from explant cultures of periapical lesions with implicated microorganisms.
AB  == the presence of igg in periapical inflammatory lesions suggests that immune responses participate in the disease process. the purpose of this investigation was to study the reactivity of igg from the supernatant fluids of explant cultures of periapical lesions with microorganisms implicated in infections of endodontic origin. ninety periapical lesions that had been contiguous with the apex of a root were removed and maintained in explant cultures. a dot-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (dot-elisa) was used to demonstrate the presence of igg in the supernatant fluids of the explant cultures reactive with a panel of microorganisms associated with infections of endodontic origin. the percentages of reactivity by dot-elisa follow: bacteroides intermedius (84%), b.  buccae (12%), porphyromonas (bacteroides) gingivalis (50%), p. endodontalis (58%), p. asaccharolyticus (17%), peptostreptococcus micros (44%), p. anaerobius  (26%), eubacterium alactolyticum (34%), fusobacterium nucleatum (14%), and actinomyces israelii (6%). at least one of the three species of b. intermedius, p. gingivalis, or p. endodontalis tested gave a positive dot-elisa with 89% of the supernatant fluids from explant cultures of periapical lesions. a lack of cross reactivity of igg in supernatant fluids from explants of periapical lesions was demonstrated for the four strains of black-pigmented bacteroides/porphyromonas by dot-elisa.

TI  == specificity of antibodies present in human periapical lesions.
AB  == various classes of immunoglobulins have been found in human periapical lesions. the specificity of secreted antibodies against antigens egressing from the root canal system has yet to be thoroughly investigated. the purpose of this study was to test the specificity of antibodies present in human periapical lesions. human  periapical biopsies were removed and cultured as organ culture explants. antibodies present in the lesions were extracted in the cell culture fluids. a modified enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to determine the presence, type, and concentration of different classes of antibodies against a number of commonly found bacterial species present in the root canal system. the data show  the presence of specific antibodies (igg, igm, and iga) against all 16 microorganisms tested. peptostreptococcus micros, actinomyces israelii, staphylococcus intermedius, and fusobacterium nucleatum produced significantly high levels of igg antibodies in these lesions.

TI  == recolonization of the subgingival microflora after scaling and root planing in human periodontitis.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to evaluate the recolonization patterns of the subgingival microflora of adult periodontitis patients after a single session of  scaling and root planing. in each of eight patients, three clinically diseased sites were investigated microbiologically by darkfield microscopy and cultural analysis. after initial clinical and microbiological parameters were determined,  each subject received a single session of scaling and root planing but no oral hygiene instructions. clinical indices were measured and microbial parameters were reassessed 7, 21, and 60 days after treatment in a manner such that each of  the test sites was sampled only once after treatment. recolonization was evaluated by matching any single site with its own preoperative site. a significant improvement in probing depth was noted for up to 60 days after treatment, while the gingival index did not change markedly during the course of  the study. the microbial composition of treated sites 7 days after scaling and root planing, as determined by both cultural and darkfield data, was similar to that of periodontally healthy sites. differences between cultural and darkfield data became apparent at the 21 day sampling point. the darkfield data showed that the sites consisted of cocci with few spirochetes. cultural data demonstrated that the majority of the cocci were anaerobic, namely streptococcus intermedius,  veillonella parvula, and peptostreptococcus micros. at 60 days, there was no significant variation in any of the parameters from pretreatment levels. the most prevalent anaerobic rods prior to and 60 days after therapy were fusobacterium nucleatum, bacteroides gingivalis, and b. intermedius.(abstract truncated at 250  words)

TI  == susceptibility of oral bacteria to phenoxyethanol and phenoxyethanol/chlorhexidine combinations.
AB  == a total of 57 bacterial strains (26 different species) which may be isolated from subgingival plaque were tested for their in vitro susceptibility to phenoxycthanol, a commonly-used antiseptic and preservative. ninety-five percent  of the strains, including those associated with chronic inflammatory periodontal  disease, were susceptible to concentrations of phenoxyethanol used topically (2%  w/v). phenoxyethanol at a concentration of 1% (w/v) was also found that to have a rapid bactericidal effect achieving a 99.9% kill in 5 minutes or less for species such as bacterodides gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, eikenella corrodens, and wolinella recta. addition of chlorhexidine to phenoxyethanol resulted in a mixture with increased antibacterial activity. for most bacterial strains, the presence of chlorhexidine resulted in at least a four-fold decrease in the concentration of pheoxyethanol required for inhibition of growth. these results imply that phenoxyethanol may be useful in the treatment of chronic inflammatory  periodontal disease either by itself or in combination with chlorhexidine.

TI  == a rapid diagnosis of anaerobic infection in the oro-maxillary region by gas-liquid chromatography.
AB  == the relationship between volatile fatty acids (vfas) in pus and infecting bacterial species was examined in order to establish a rapid identification system for anaerobic microorganisms in purulent inflammation in the oro-maxillary region. vfas were detected by the direct injection of pus into gas-liquid chromatography (glc). bacterial examination was carried out by anaerobic culture  using blood agar plates. the bacterial identification was carried out mainly according to the vpi manual. analysis of the direct vfa patterns of each sample resulted in 5 groups. the following bacterial species were the main isolates in each group: streptococcus intermedius in group a, peptostreptococcus micros in group b, fusobacterium nucleatum in group c, bacteroides gingivalis in group d, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius in group e. the profile of vfas produced in the pyg culture medium of the above isolated bacteria was compared with the direct vfa patterns. agreement ratios between direct and pyg vfa patterns were as follows: group a, 47.1%; groups b and c, 45.0%; group d, 87.5%; and group e, 62.9%. the acetic acid concentration was more than 14 x 10(-4) meq/ml in group b, the butyric acid concentration was more than 7 x 10(-4) meq/ml in group c, and the iso-caproic acid concentration was more than 14 x 10(-4) meq/ml in group e. in these cases, it was found that the agreement ratios between the direct and pyg fva pattern were high. in group d, irrespective of the concentration of iso-valeric acid detected, the agreement ratio was very high. the antibiotic susceptibility of the isolates was studied. efficiency rates of abpc, pipc, ccl,  cez, cmz, sbt/cpz, jm, cldm, mino and gm were relatively low and resistant rates  were high for the gram-negative rods.

AB  == membrane preparations of fusobacterium nucleatum grown on glutamate contain glutaconyl-coa decarboxylase at a high specific activity (13.8 nkat/mg protein).  the enzyme was solubilized with 2% triton x-100 in 0.5 m nacl and purified 63-fold to a specific activity of 870 nkat/mg by affinity chromatography on monomeric avidin-sepharose. the activity of the decarboxylase was strictly dependent on na+ (km = 3 mm) and was stimulated up to 3-fold by phospholipids. the glutaconyl-coa decarboxylases from the gram-positive bacteria acidaminococcus fermentans and clostridium symbiosum have a lower apparent km for na+ (1 mm) and  were not stimulated by phospholipids. in addition only the fusobacterial decarboxylase required sodium ion for stability and was inactivated by potassium  ion. by incorporation of this purified enzyme into phospholipids an electrogenic  sodium ion pump was reconstituted. the enzyme consists of four subunits, alpha (m = 65 kda), beta (33 kda), gamma (19 kda), and delta (16 kda) with the functions of a carboxy transferase (alpha), a carboxy lyase (beta and probably delta) and a biotin carrier (gamma). the subunits are very similar to those of the glutaconyl-coa decarboxylases from the gram-positive bacteria. with an antiserum  directed against the decarboxylase from a. fermentans the alpha- and the biotin containing subunits of the three decarboxylases and that from peptostreptococcus  asaccharolyticus could be detected on western blots.

TI  == quantitative bacteriology of a case of acute parotitis.
AB  == it is generally assumed that the microorganisms responsible for acute suppurative parotitis are facultative anaerobes, primarily staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus viridans. a quantitative microbiologic investigation of an aspirate of pus from the case we report revealed a microbial flora (5.1 x 10(6) cfu/ml) consisting entirely of strict anaerobes (fusobacterium nucleatum and peptostreptococcus anaerobius). the strain of f. nucleatum was sensitive to metronidazole but resistant to penicillin, amoxicillin, and erythromycin (minimum inhibitory concentration greater than 16 micrograms/ml). p. anaerobius was sensitive to the antibiotics tested. it is concluded that a high concentration of viable anaerobic bacteria may be present in acute suppurative parotitis and thus  pus obtained from cases of sialadenitis should be cultured with microbiologic methods capable of isolating strict anaerobes. additionally, antibiotic sensitivity should be determined routinely.

TI  == coaggregation of fusobacterium nucleatum, selenomonas flueggei, selenomonas infelix, selenomonas noxia, and selenomonas sputigena with strains from 11 genera of oral bacteria.
AB  == twenty-eight strains of fusobacterium nucleatum and 41 selenomonas strains, including s. sputigena (24 strains), s. flueggei (10 strains), s. infelix (5 strains), and s. noxia (2 strains), were tested for their ability to coaggregate  with each other and with 49 other strains of oral bacteria representing actinobacillus, actinomyces, bacteroides, capnocytophaga, gemella, peptostreptococcus, porphyromonas, propionibacterium, rothia, streptococcus, and  veillonella species. selenomonads coaggregated with fusobacteria and with actinomyces naeslundii pk984 but not with any of the other bacteria, including other selenomonads. in contrast, fusobacteria coaggregated with members of all genera, although not with all strains of each species tested. each fusobacterium  strain appeared to have its own set of partners and coaggregation properties, unlike their partners, whose coaggregation properties in earlier surveys delineated distinct coaggregation groups. coaggregations of fusobacteria with the 63 gram-negative strains were usually inhibited by edta, whereas those with the 27 gram-positive strains were usually not inhibited. likewise, lactose-inhibitable coaggregations were common among some strains of fusobacteria and some strains from each of the genera containing gram-negative partners but were rarely observed with gram-positive partners. heating the fusobacteria at 85  degrees c for 30 min completely prevented coaggregation with most partners, suggesting the involvement of a protein on the fusobacteria. heat treatment of many of the gram-negative partners not only enhanced their coaggregation with the fusobacteria but also changed lactose-sensitive coaggregations to lactose-insensitive coaggregations. although fusobacteria coaggregated with a broader variety of oral partner strains than any other group of oral bacteria tested to date, each fusobacterium exhibited coaggregation with only a certain set of partner strains, and none of the fusobacteria adhered to other strains of  fusobacteria, indicating that recognition of partner cell surfaces is selective.  the strains of f. nucleatum are heterogeneous and cannot be clustered into distinct coaggregation groups. collectively, these results indicate that coaggregation between fusobacteria and many gram-negative partners is significantly different from their coaggregation with gram-positive partners. the contrasting variety of partners for fusobacteria and selenomonads supports the concept of coaggregation partner specificity that has been observed with every genus of oral bacteria so far examined.

TI  == anaerobic infections in the head and neck region.
AB  == anaerobic bacteria form the predominant flora of the oral cavity, outnumbering facultative organisms by 10-1,000: 1. the type of anaerobic bacteria and their concentration depend on the anatomical site and the degree of anaerobiosis in the different sites in the mouth. three groups of anaerobic bacteria inhabit the oral cavity; the strict anaerobes, the moderate anaerobes, and the microaerophilic group of organisms. the majority of anaerobic bacterial infections occurring in the region of the mouth, head and neck are caused by the commensal flora. these infections include dental and periodontal disease where the predominant organisms are bacteroides species, veillonella, bifidobacteria, peptococcus, peptostreptococcus and propionibacterium species. more recently, bacteroides endontalis has been isolated from a periapical abscess of endodontal origin and b. gingivalis, b. intermedius, haemophilus actinomycetemcomitans and wollinella species in chronic periodontal disease. treponema species and other strict anaerobes are seen in smears of severe periodontal disease and acute necrotising  gingivitis, but have not yet been isolated in pure culture. until such time, their role in disease remains uncertain. fusobacterium nucleatum is specially associated with severe orofacial infections which may extend into the mediastinum. other anaerobic infections include chronic otitis media, chronic sinusitis and mastoiditis, and brain abscess. treatment of these conditions should include the use of beta-lactamase resistant antimicrobials, such as clindamycin or one of the nitroimidazoles with penicillin.

AB  == the present experiments were aimed at studying the degradation of salivary glycoproteins by the oral microflora. to this end, s. sanguis i strain ny476 and  s. sanguis ii (s. mitior) strain ny581 were grown continuously in human-whole saliva. under these conditions, the strains produced a variety of cell-associated hydrolytic activities, including glycosidases, exo- and endopeptidases, and esterases. s. sanguis ii generally exhibited higher levels of enzyme activity than did s. sanguis i, in particular of neuraminidase that was produced only by s. sanguis ii. in accordance, s. sanguis ii had a higher cell yield and consumed  a higher proportion of the sugars and sialic acid in the glycoproteins than did s. sanguis i. interestingly, s. sanguis i, which is devoid of neuraminidase, is known to have a lectin with specificity for sialic acid, whereas s. sanguis ii has affinity for galactose residues in the glycoproteins. we propose that specific binding of glycoproteins by oral bacteria constitutes a mechanism to collect nutrients in the vicinity of the cell. the special ability of s. sanguis  ii to utilize saliva for growth was further exemplified by its selection in batch-wise enrichments of dental plaque on saliva. the microflora in these enrichment cultures always consisted of peptostreptococcus micros, s. sanguis ii, and fusobacterium nucleatum as the dominant organisms. further, s. mitis and gemella haemolysans were generally found to be present. the enrichment cultures produced a wide variety of mainly cell-bound hydrolytic enzymes. this resulted in almost complete breakdown of salivary glycoproteins in the culture.

TI  == enrichment of subgingival microflora on human serum leading to accumulation of bacteroides species, peptostreptococci and fusobacteria.
AB  == this study was undertaken to identify ecological factors that favour opportunistic pathogenic species in the subgingival microflora. in a first approach, human serum as a substitute for gingival exudate, was used for batch-wise enrichment of subgingival plaque. the microflora resulting after 5-6 enrichment steps consisted of black-pigmented and non-black-pigmented bacteroides species, peptostreptococcus micros and fusobacterium nucleatum as the main organisms. it is noted that the same group of species was found to be enriched independent upon the origin of the subgingival plaque sample. it was suggested that these organisms are favoured by the increased flow of gingival exudate during inflammation. the consortium of organisms was capable of selective degradation of serum (glyco-)proteins. four different types of degradation occurred. after a prolonged period of growth complete degradation of immunoglobulins, haptoglobin, transferrin and complement c3c was observed. partial degradation of immunoglobulins, haptoglobin, transferrin, albumin, alpha  1-antitrypsin and complement c3c and c4 was generally observed after 48 h of growth. besides, immunoglobulin protease activity yielding fc and fab fragments was found. the consortium was also capable of consuming carbohydrate side-chains  as indicated by an altered electrophoretic mobility of the serum glycoproteins.

TI  == [sensitivity of anaerobes to 8 antibiotics].
AB  == we studied the susceptibility of 282 obligate anaerobes to 8 antibiotics. the strains were isolated from clinical specimens taken during 1983 and 1984. minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined using a microplate method for 245 strains and agar dilution for 33 bacteroides asaccharolyticus strains. tested strains were as follows: 85 bacteroides fragilis, 71 clostridium, 19 fusobacterium nucleatum, 35 peptostreptococcus, 39 bacteroides oralis and bacteroides bivius and 33 bacteroides asaccharolyticus. tested antibiotics were:  metronidazole, clindamycin, minocycline, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, moxalactam, keflin and carbenicillin. for bacteroides fragilis, the three most active antibiotics were metronidazole (inhibition of all strains with 8 micrograms/ml),  minocycline and clindamycin (inhibition of 95% of strains by mics less than or equal to 0.5 microgram/ml). however, four strains were resistant to clindamycin (mics greater than 8 micrograms/ml). the other anaerobic strains tested were susceptible. however, a few bacteroides bivius strains were resistant to keflin (mic greater than or equal to 64 micrograms/ml for 5% of strains).

TI  == survival analysis of periodontal sites before and after periodontal therapy.
AB  == periodontal diseases appear to progress with bursts of destructive activity at individual sites. one effect of treatment might be to diminish the frequency of such bursts. survival analysis was employed to seek such effects on the periodontal sites of 16 individuals with prior evidence of destructive periodontal disease. the subjects were monitored at bi-monthly intervals and actively breaking down sites were detected using attachment level measurements and the tolerance method of analysis. when active sites were detected, control sites of equal pocket depth and attachment loss were selected and microbiological and immunological samples were taken. the subjects were treated by modified widman flap surgery and systemically administered tetracycline. on completion of  therapy, bi-monthly monitoring was reinstituted. life tables were constructed for periodontal sites in each of the 16 subjects prior to and after therapy. a site losing more than 3 mm of attachment at any time interval was considered to have relapsed or "died". survivor functions were calculated for each time period indicating the % of sites which survived at any time. the subjects were divided into 3 categories on the basis of post-therapy survivor functions. the annual hazard rate in 9 good treatment response subjects (group 1) was reduced from 0.10/year to 0.01/year. the hazard rate of 5 intermediate treatment response subjects (group 2a) was reduced from 0.16/year to 0.04/year and that of 2 poor treatment response subjects (group 2b) from 0.15/year to 0.07/year. group 2a and  2b individuals were combined and differences were sought in clinical, microbiological and immunological parameters between the good and poor treatment  response groups. 5 out of 7 of the poor responding individuals showed elevated humoral antibody responses to 3 or more gram-negative subgingival species tested. many of the elevated responses in this group were to organisms which are widely distributed and return quickly after therapy such as fusobacterium nucleatum, eikenella corrodens, bacteroides intermedius and capnocytophaga sputigena. the predominant cultivable microbiota in subgingival samples taken prior to therapy from the good responding group had significantly greater proportions of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, c. ochracea and b. intermedius than the poor responding group. the latter group showed significantly elevated proportions of f. nucleatum, peptostreptococcus micros and streptococcus intermedius.

TI  == serum antibody reactive with predominant organisms in the subgingival flora of young adults with generalized severe periodontitis.
AB  == in the present study we sought to determine whether serum antibody was present against microorganisms which predominate in the subgingival flora of young adults with generalized severe periodontitis (sp). subjects with sp were often seropositive for eubacterium brachy, fusobacterium nucleatum e3c22, and peptostreptococcus micros, whereas subjects with juvenile periodontitis (jp) and  subjects with healthy periodontium (hp) were not. both sp and jp subjects were more frequently seropositive for bacteroides gingivalis, f. nucleatum d52b16, and f. nucleatum e1d1 than were hp subjects. the data were most striking for b. gingivalis, for which both the incidence and the magnitude of specific antibody was clearly elevated for sp and jp subject groups. however, sp subjects generally had either a high antibody titer or no detectable titer. in contrast, jp and hp subjects generally had at least very small amounts of antibody. except at very low levels of antibody, neither sp nor jp groups differed significantly from the  hp group for antibody to eubacterium nodatum, bacteroides intermedius (homology group 4197 or 8944), or lactobacillus minutus antibody. there was a high frequency of antibody to e. nodatum, with very high titers in all groups despite  the fact that this organism is rarely found in hp subjects. for eubacterium timidum, the jp group was clearly more frequently seropositive than the hp group. despite high levels of l. minutus in subgingival flora, none of the 50 sp subjects had a detectable antibody titer, and only four of the hp and jp subjects had detectable antibody. these results indicate that many organisms in the subgingival flora elicit antibody responses. b. gingivalis is probably the best example among the species tested. however, some organisms that are present in high concentration, e.g., l. minutus, apparently fail to induce significant antibody responses.

TI  == role of anaerobic bacteria in bite-wound infections.
AB  == the etiologic agents usually involved in wound infections due to human or animal  bites are the aerobic skin flora of the victim, e.g., staphylococcus aureus, and/or the aerobic oral flora of the biter, e.g., pasteurella multocida. while anaerobic bacteria are predominant in the normal oral flora of humans and animals, their importance in the pathogenesis of bite-wound infections has not been stressed. most investigators in this field have either not cultured these wounds for anaerobic bacteria or not utilized optimal culture techniques. in a series of studies on human and animal bite wounds, methods that are optimal for recovery of anaerobic bacteria were used. anaerobes were found in significant quantities in 39% of animal bite wounds, 50% of human bite wounds, and 56% of clenched-fist injuries. several species of anaerobes usually were present in the  wounds and always were present in mixed culture with aerobic oral flora. the anaerobes most commonly isolated included bacteroides asaccharolyticus, bacteroides bivius, bacteroides disiens, bacteroides melaninogenicus, bacteroides oralis, bacteroides ruminicola, bacteroides pneumosintes, bacteroides ureolyticus, fusobacterium nucleatum, fusobacterium russii, peptococcus species,  peptostreptococcus species, and veillonella species. initial, empiric antimicrobial therapy for bite wounds should be directed against potential anaerobic as well as aerobic pathogens.

TI  == death of an african elephant from probable toxemia attributed to chronic pulpitis.
AB  == a 31-year-old captive male african elephant (loxodonta africana) of 5,000-kg body weight died suddenly in ventral recumbency. lesions seen at necropsy were bilateral purulent pulpitis and periodontitis of both tusks, serous atrophy of coronary groove fat, grammocephalus cholangitis, myocardial and skeletal lipofuscinosis, and scattered segmental necrosis in the pectoral muscles. nonhemolytic streptococci, corynebacterium sp, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, fusobacterium nucleatum, and bacteroides sp, were recovered from the exudate around one or both tusks. we postulated that the elephant died of hypoxia from prolonged ventral recumbency because of weakness and inability to rise secondary  to toxemia from bilateral pulpitis and periodontitis.

TI  == bacteriology of dental abscesses of endodontic origin.
AB  == aspirates have been cultured from 10 dental abscesses of endodontic origin, all of which had penetrated beyond the bony alveolus to produce fluctuant swelling. sampling was by syringe aspiration. strict anaerobic techniques, including the use of an anaerobic chamber, were used for serial dilution and plating. randomly  selected colonies (100) from each culture were purified, characterized, and identified. seventy percent of the bacterial isolates were either strict anaerobes or microaerophilic. one abscess yielded a pure culture of a viridans streptococcus, streptococcus milleri. streptococcus intermedius dominated the flora in a second abscess. the common oral streptococcus, streptococcus sanguis,  constituted only 2% of the isolates from one additional infection. fusobacterium  nucleatum, bacteroides melaninogenicus, other bacteroides including b. oralis and b. ruminicola, anaerobic diphtheroids, peptostreptococcus micros, and staphylococcus epidermis were other predominant isolates.

TI  == circulating antibodies after experimental chronic infection in the root canal of  teeth in monkeys.
AB  == root canals of 49 teeth with necrotic pulp tissue in five monkeys were infected with streptococcus faecalis ss liquefaciens, actinomyces bovis, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and bacteroides oralis in various combinations. after 6 months the root canals and the periapical tissues were subjected to radiographic, bacteriologic, and histologic examinations. signs of periapical inflammation were radiographically registered in 41 teeth, most frequently in teeth inoculated with a mixed flora. in 11 out of 16 teeth infected separately with strep. faecalis ss liquefaciens, apical periodontitis was observed. sera from the monkeys prior to and after the experimental inoculation were analyzed by means of gel diffusion, hemagglutination (ha), and complement binding test for antibodies against different antigen preparations of the homologous bacterial strains used for the inoculation. detectable antibodies were seen with antigens of b. oralis in all five monkeys. agglutinating antibodies were demonstrated with lipopolysaccharide-antigen of b. oralis in titers between  1:40 and 1:320. a marked reduction of the antibody level against lipopolysaccharide (lps) antigen after mercaptoethanol treatment indicated that a main part of the antibodies registered was of igm-class. the study shows that certain antigens of bacterial origin from infected root canals, while affecting the periapical tissues, also stimulate the production of circulating antibodies.

AB  == an anaerobic incubator was compared with a standard jar system for the isolation  of anaerobes from clinical material. seventy specimens were selected as likely to yield anaerobes: 342 different anaerobes were isolated in the incubator and 347 in anaebrobic jars. these included bacteroides spp (43%), peptococcus spp (26%),  peptostreptococcus spp (13%), veillonella spp (7%), fusobacterium spp (7%), clostridium spp (2%) and miscellaneous gram-positive nonsporing bacilli (2%). differences in isolation rates for each system were inconsistent and minor. sixteen anaerobes were chosen for quantitative tests at the beginning and end of  the study period. miles and misra counts showed a slight advantage of the incubator for f nucleatum, but no difference for b fragilis, b thetaiomicron, b uniformis, b bivius, b corrodens, f mortiferum, ps anaerobius, p prevotii or propionibacterium acnes. in almost all cases, colonies in anaerobic jars were slightly larger than those in the incubator. disc antibiotic sensitivity tests gave the same results in each system, at the beginning and end of the study period. the anaerobic incubator provides an effective means of isolation of anaerobes in a clinical laboratory. however, several design features of the prototype would require change if the system were introduced.

TI  == biotransformation of 1-nitropyrene in intestinal anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == mutagenic nitroaromatic compounds have recently been found in photocopies, urban  atmosphere, automobile exhaust and wastewater. 1-nitropyrene (1-np) is readily formed when pyrene, ubiquitous in the environment, is exposed to nitrogen dioxide in the urban atmosphere or in automobile exhaust, and is highly mutagenic, inducing 449 his+ revertants/plate/nmol from salmonella typhimurium strain ta98 in the absence of s9 fraction in the salmonella-microsome test. it is possible to swallow sputum or some food containing 1-np and it would come into contact with the normal bacterial flora. we determined the 1-np nitroreductase activity in environmental and laboratory bacterial strains. we found that the mutagenicity of 1-np mixed with the feces of a healthy man or a culture of anaerobic bacteria was decreased. the product proved to be 1-aminopyrene (1-ap), based on its fluorescence spectrum, its mass spectrum, and its characteristic thin layer chromatographic and high performance liquid chromatographic patterns. the 1-np nitroreductase activity of aerobic bacteria was low, but crude extracts from the  anaerobic bacteria, i.e., bacteroides fragilis, b. thetaiotaomicron, b. vulgatus, fusobacterium mortiferum, f. nucleatum, clostridium perfringens, c. sporogenes, bifidobacterium adolescentis, b. bifidum, eubacterium lentum, e. limosum, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius, all easily converted 1-np to 1-ap and proportionally decreased the mutagenic activity of 1-np.

(including 3 b. melaninogenicus), 5 propionibacterium acnes, and 4 fusobacterium  nucleatum. these data demonstrate the role of anaerobic organisms in cervical lymphadenitis and the need to culture aspirated material for both aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms.
