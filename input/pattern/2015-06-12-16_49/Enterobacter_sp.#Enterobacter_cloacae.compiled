TI  - Enterobacter aerogenes and Enterobacter cloacae; versatile bacterial pathogens confronting antibiotic treatment.
AB  - Enterobacter aerogenes and E. cloacae have been reported as important opportunistic and multiresistant bacterial pathogens for humans during the last three decades in hospital wards. These Gram-negative bacteria have been largely described during several outbreaks of hospital-acquired infections in Europe and particularly in France. The dissemination of Enterobacter sp. is associated with the presence of redundant regulatory cascades that efficiently control the membrane permeability ensuring the bacterial protection and the expression of detoxifying enzymes involved in antibiotic degradation/inactivation. In addition, these bacterial species are able to acquire numerous genetic mobile elements that strongly contribute to antibiotic resistance. Moreover, this particular fitness help them to colonize several environments and hosts and rapidly and efficiently adapt their metabolism and physiology to external conditions and environmental stresses. Enterobacter is a versatile bacterium able to promptly respond to the antibiotic treatment in the colonized patient. The balance of the prevalence, E. aerogenes versus E. cloacae, in the reported hospital infections during the last period, questions about the horizontal transmission of mobile elements containing antibiotic resistance genes, e.g., the efficacy of the exchange of resistance genes Klebsiella pneumoniae to Enterobacter sp. It is also important to mention the possible role of antibiotic use in the treatment of bacterial infectious diseases in this E. aerogenes/E. cloacae evolution.
TI  - Dynamics of MDR Enterobacter cloacae outbreaks in a neonatal unit in Nepal: insights using wider sampling frames and next-generation sequencing.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: There are limited data on Enterobacter cloacae outbreaks and fewer describing these in association with NDM-1. With whole-genome sequencing, we tested the hypothesis that a cluster of 16 E. cloacae bacteraemia cases in a Nepali neonatal unit represented a single clonal outbreak, using a wider set of epidemiologically unrelated clinical E. cloacae isolates for comparison. METHODS: Forty-three isolates were analysed, including 23 E. cloacae and 3 Citrobacter sp. isolates obtained from blood cultures from 16 neonates over a 3 month period. These were compared with two contemporaneous community-associated drug-resistant isolates from adults, a unit soap dispenser isolate and a set of historical invasive isolates (n=14) from the same geographical locality. RESULTS: There were two clear neonatal outbreaks and one isolated case in the unit. One outbreak was associated with an NDM-1 plasmid also identified in a historical community-associated strain. The smaller, second outbreak was likely associated with a contaminated soap dispenser. The two community-acquired adult cases and three sets of historical hospital-associated neonatal isolates represented four additional genetic clusters. CONCLUSIONS: E. cloacae infections in this context represent several different transmission networks, operating at the community/hospital and host strain/plasmid levels. Wide sampling frames and high-resolution typing methods are needed to describe the complex molecular epidemiology of E. cloacae outbreaks, which is not appropriately reflected by routine susceptibility phenotypes. Soap dispensers may represent a reservoir for E. cloacae and bacterial strains and plasmids may persist in hospitals and in the community for long periods, sporadically being involved in outbreaks of disease.
TI  - [Herpes gestationis. A case report].
AB  - Case report. 21 years old woman with 30 week pregnancy, complicated by a 3 month  multitreated skin condition, who was referred to General Hospital Morelia, with probable diagnosis of Kapossi sarcoma and sus- pected HIV. She presented with exulcerations involving the palate, lips, chest, abdomen, back and extremities. The lesions were, itchy and painful, with thick yellowish secretion, accompanied by dysphagia to solid foods. Laboratory results showed normochromic normocytic anemia, elevation of ESR, hypocalcaemia, increased PCR, results in alterations in various TORCH listing, HIV negative. The biopsy of a lesion of the forearm reported histological changes consistent with herpes, subsequently confirmed by direct immunofluorescence. Liquid aspiration secretion of one of the lesions reported coagulase negative staphylococcus sp and Enterobacter cloacae. The final diagnosis was 30 weeks pregnant women with gestational herpes complicated by pyogenic infection of the lesions, discarding infection with HIV and found positive for IgG to toxoplasma, rubella, cytomegalovirus and herpes virus.
TI  - Characterization of Beta-lactamases in Faecal Enterobacteriaceae Recovered from Healthy Humans in Spain: Focusing on AmpC Polymorphisms.
AB  - The intestinal tract is a huge reservoir of Enterobacteriaceae, some of which are opportunist pathogens. Several genera of these bacteria harbour intrinsic antibiotic resistance genes, such as ampC genes in species of Citrobacter, Enterobacter or Escherichia genera. In this work, beta-lactamases and other resistance mechanisms have been characterized in Enterobacteriaceae isolates recovered from healthy human faecal samples, focusing on the ampC beta-lactamase genes. Fifty human faecal samples were obtained, and 70 Enterobacteriaceae bacteria were isolated: 44 Escherichia coli, 4 Citrobacter braakii, 9 Citrobacter freundii, 8 Enterobacter cloacae, 1 Proteus mirabilis, 1 Proteus vulgaris, 1 Klebsiella oxytoca, 1 Serratia sp. and 1 Cronobacter sp. A high percentage of resistance to ampicillin was detected (57 %), observing the AmpC phenotype in 22 isolates (31 %) and the ESBL phenotype in 3 isolates. AmpC molecular characterization showed high diversity into bla CMY and bla ACT genes from Citrobacter and Enterobacter species, respectively, and the pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis demonstrated low clonality among them. The prevalence of people colonized by strains carrying plasmid-mediated ampC genes obtained in this study was 2 %. The unique plasmid-mediated bla AmpC identified in this study was the bla CMY-2 gene, detected in an E. coli isolate ascribed to the sequence type ST405 which belonged to phylogenetic group D. The hybridization and conjugation experiments demonstrated that the ISEcp1-bla CMY-2-blc structure was carried by a ~78-kb self-transferable IncK plasmid. This study shows a high polymorphism among beta-lactamase genes in Enterobacteriaceae from healthy people microbiota. Extensive AmpC-carrier studies would provide important information and could allow the anticipation of future global health problems.
TI  - Microbial evaluation of sandboxes located in urban area.
AB  - This paper presents the results of a study on the degree of bacteriological pollution of sandboxes situated in fenced and unfenced housing estates located in an urban area in Olsztyn, Poland. Heterotrophic plate counts (HPC22, HPC37), Enterobacteriaceae, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus spp., Staphylococcus spp. and Clostridium perfringens determined by cultivation and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) methods were used as indicators of the sanitary state. Their maximum number in the sand samples reached values of up to 5.4x10(7), 2.6x10(6), 3.3x10(4), 2.1x10(3), 1.8x10(4), 1.9x10(1) and 1.2x10(4)CFU/g, respectively. It was found that values of culture-independent method were two-four orders greater than those obtained by the cultivation method. Among identified Enterobacteriaceae, Pantoea spp. and Enterobacter cloacae were the most numerous, whereas Escherichia cells were detected only occasionally. Pathogenic bacteria of the genus Salmonella sp. were isolated from sandboxes also when E. coli were absent. Bacteria from Staphylococcus genus were isolated irrespective of the site and time of sampling. Additionally, the presence of molds and yeasts was studied. Maximum counts of these microorganisms amounted to 1.0x10(5) and to 3.5x10(4)CFU/g. Aspergillus, Penicillium, Alternaria and Trichoderma genera were most numerous among molds, whereas Trichosporon was detected most frequently among yeasts. Sandboxes in the fenced housing estate and those located in the area which is not close to trees were less polluted than the sand collected from sandboxes in the unfenced housing estate. Potentially pathogenic bacteria of the genus Salmonella spp. were identified in analyzed sandboxes, also when Toxocara and E. coli were absent. It seems that assessing the contamination of children's play areas basing only on fecal bacteria counts and by monitoring number of parasites' eggs may be insufficient to evaluate microbial pollution of sandboxes and may not fully reflect their safety for children.
TI  - Unusual association of NDM-1 with KPC-2 and armA among Brazilian Enterobacteriaceae isolates.
AB  - We report the microbiological characterization of four New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1 (blaNDM-1)-producing Enterobacteriaceae isolated in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. blaNDM-1 was located on a conjugative plasmid and was associated with Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase-2 (blaKPC-2) or aminoglycoside-resistance methylase (armA), a 16S rRNA methylase not previously reported in Brazil, in two distinct strains of Enterobacter cloacae. Our results suggested that the introduction of blaNDM-1 in Brazil has been accompanied by rapid spread, since our isolates showed no genetic relationship.
TI  - Biomineralization and formulation of endosulfan degrading bacterial and fungal consortiums.
AB  - Microbial degradation offers an effective approach to remove toxicants and in this study, a microbial consortium consisting of bacterial strains and fungal strains were originally obtained from endosulfan contaminated agricultural soils. Identification of the bacterial isolates by 16S rRNA sequences revealed the isolates to be Halophilic bacterium JAS4, Klebsiella pneumoniae JAS8, Enterobacter asburiae JAS5, and Enterobacter cloacae JAS7, whereas the fungal isolates were identified by 18S rRNA sequences and the isolates were Botryosphaeria laricina JAS6, Aspergillus tamarii JAS9 and Lasiodiplodia sp. JAS12. The biodegradation of endosulfan was monitored by using HPLC and FTIR analysis. The bacterial and fungal consortium could degrade 1000 mg l(-1) of endosulfan efficiently in aqueous medium and in soil. The infrared spectrum of endosulfan degraded samples in the aqueous medium by bacterial and fungal consortium showed bands at 1400 and 950 cm(-1) which are the characteristics of COOH group and acid dimer band respectively. In the present investigation, low cost solid materials such as sawdust, soil, fly ash, molasses and nutrients were used for the formulation of microbial consortium and to achieve greater multiplication and survival of the microbial strains.
TI  - Kinetics of biological decolorisation of anthraquinone based Reactive Blue 19 using an isolated strain of Enterobacter sp.F NCIM 5545.
AB  - In the present study, an attempt was made to evaluate the bacterial decolorisation of Reactive Blue 19 by an Enterobacter sp.F which was isolated from a mixed culture from anaerobic digester for biogas production. Phenotypic characterization and phylogenetic analysis based on DNA sequencing comparisons indicate that Enterobacter sp.F was 99.7% similar to Enterobacter cloacae ATCC13047. The kinetics of Reactive Blue 19 dye decolorisation by bacterium had been estimated. Effects of substrate concentration, oxygen, temperature, pH, glucose and glucose to microbe weight ratio on the rate of decolorisation were investigated to understand key factor that determines the performance of dye decolorisation. The maximum decolorisation efficiency of Reactive Blue 19 was 90% over period of 24 h for optimized parameter. To the best of our knowledge, this research study is the report where Enterobacter sp.F has been reported with about 90% decolorizing ability against anthraquinone based Reactive Blue 19 dye.
TI  - Effects of Ensiling Fermentation and Aerobic Deterioration on the Bacterial Community in Italian Ryegrass, Guinea Grass, and Whole-crop Maize Silages Stored at High Moisture Content.
AB  - The effects of storage period and aerobic deterioration on the bacterial community were examined in Italian ryegrass (IR), guinea grass (GG), and whole-crop maize (WM) silages. Direct-cut forages were stored in a laboratory silo for 3, 7, 14, 28, 56, and 120 d without any additives; live counts, content of fermentation products, and characteristics of the bacterial community were determined. 2,3-Butanediol, acetic acid, and lactic acid were the dominant fermentation products in the IR, GG, and WM silages, respectively. The acetic acid content increased as a result of prolonged ensiling, regardless of the type of silage crop, and the changes were distinctively visible from the beginning of GG ensiling. Pantoea agglomerans, Rahnella aquatilis, and Enterobacter sp. were the major bacteria in the IR silage, indicating that alcoholic fermentation may be due to the activity of enterobacteria. Staphylococcus sciuri and Bacillus pumilus were detected when IR silage was spoiled, whereas between aerobically stable and unstable silages, no differences were seen in the bacterial community at silo opening. Lactococcus lactis was a representative bacterium, although acetic acid was the major fermentation product in the GG silage. Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus brevis, and Morganella morganii were suggested to be associated with the increase in acetic acid due to prolonged storage. Enterobacter cloacae appeared when the GG silage was spoiled. In the WM silage, no distinctive changes due to prolonged ensiling were seen in the bacterial community. Throughout the ensiling, Weissella paramesenteroides, Weissella confusa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae were present in addition to L. plantarum, L. brevis, and L. lactis. Upon deterioration, Acetobacter pasteurianus, Klebsiella variicola, Enterobacter hormaechei, and Bacillus gibsonii were detected. These results demonstrate the diverse bacterial community that evolves during ensiling and aerobic spoilage of IR, GG, and WM silages.
TI  - Study of bio-degradation and bio-decolourization of azo dye by Enterobacter sp. SXCR.
AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the decolourization potential of textile dyes by a relatively newly identified bacteria species, Enterobacter sp. SXCR which was isolated from the petroleum polluted soil samples. The bacterial strain was identified by 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. The effects of operational conditions like initial dye concentration, pH, and temperature were optimized to develop an economically feasible decolourization process. The isolate was able to decolourize sulphonated azo dye (Congo red) over a wide range (0.1-1 gl(-1)), pH 5-9, and temperature 22-40 degrees C in static condition. Anaerobic condition with minimal salt medium supplemented with 2 gl(-1) glucose, pH 7 and 34 degrees C were considered to be the optimum decolourizing condition. The bacterial isolate SXCR showed a strong ability to decolourize dye (0.2 gl(-1)) within 93 h. The biodegradation was monitored by UV-vis, fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy (FTIR) spectroscopy and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Furthermore, the involvement of azoreductase in the decolourization process was identified in this strain. Cells of Enterobacter cloacae were immobilized by entrapment in calcium-alginate beads. Immobilized bacterial cells were able to reduced azo bonds enzymatically and used as a biocatalyst for decolourization of azo dye Congo red. Michaelis-Menten kinetics was used to describe the correlation between the decolourization rate and the dye concentration.
TI  - First report of metallo-beta-lactamases producing Enterobacter spp. strains from  Venezuela.
AB  - Clinical strains of Enterobacter were isolated from Cumana's Central Hospital in  Venezuela, and classified as E. cloacae (21), E. aerogenes (7), E. intermedium (1), E. sakazakii (1) and three unclassified. The strains showed high levels of resistance, especially to SXT (58.1%), CRO (48.8%), CAZ (46.6%), PIP (46.4%), CIP (45.2%) and ATM (43.3%). This is the first report for South America of blaVIM-2 in two E. cloacae and one Enterobacter sp., which also showed multiple mechanisms of resistance. Both E. cloacae showed blaTEM-1, but only one showed blaCTX-M-15 gene, while no blaSHV was detected.
TI  - Plantaricin LD1: a bacteriocin produced by food isolate of Lactobacillus plantarum LD1.
AB  - Plantaricin LD1, a bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus plantarum LD1, was characterized for biochemical and antimicrobial properties. Bacteriocin showed stability at high temperatures (100 degrees C for 20 min and 121 degrees C for 15 min under 15 psi pressure), in a pH range of 2.0-8.0 and also in the presence of organic solvents, surfactants and detergents. The crude preparation was not affected by catalase, amylase and lipase but activity was reduced in the presence of pepsin, trypsin and proteinase K showing proteinaceous nature of the compound. The molecular weight of bacteriocin was found to be approximately 6.5 kDa, and antimicrobial activity was confirmed by bioassay. It inhibited not only related strains but also other Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria such as Lactobacillus curvatus NRRL B-4562, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis NRRL B-1821, Enterococcus faecium NRRL B-2354, Enterobacter cloacae NRRL B-14298, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, urogenic Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri and Vibrio sp. These properties of plantaricin LD1 suggest its applications not only in food safety but in therapeutics as well.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of ceftazidime-avibactam against Gram-negative organisms collected from U.S. medical centers in 2012.
AB  - The activities of the novel beta-lactam-beta-lactamase inhibitor combination ceftazidime-avibactam and comparator agents were evaluated against a contemporary collection of clinically significant Gram-negative bacilli. Avibactam is a novel non-beta-lactam beta-lactamase inhibitor that inhibits Ambler class A, C, and some D enzymes. A total of 10,928 Gram-negative bacilli-8,640 Enterobacteriaceae, 1,967 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 321 Acinetobacter sp. isolates-were collected from 73 U.S. hospitals and tested for susceptibility by reference broth microdilution methods in a central monitoring laboratory (JMI Laboratories, North Liberty, IA, USA). Ceftazidime was combined with avibactam at a fixed concentration of 4 mug/ml. Overall, 99.8% of Enterobacteriaceae strains were inhibited at a ceftazidime-avibactam MIC of </=4 mug/ml. Ceftazidime-avibactam was active against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-phenotype Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, meropenem-nonsusceptible (MIC>/=2 mug/ml) K. pneumoniae, and ceftazidime-nonsusceptible Enterobacter cloacae. Among ESBL-phenotype K. pneumoniae strains, 61.1% were meropenem susceptible and 99.3% were inhibited at a ceftazidime-avibactam MIC of </=4 mug/ml. Among P. aeruginosa strains, 96.9% were inhibited at a ceftazidime-avibactam MIC of </=8 mug/ml, and susceptibility rates for meropenem, ceftazidime, and piperacillin-tazobactam were 82.0, 83.2, and 78.3%, respectively. Ceftazidime-avibactam was the most active compound tested against meropenem-nonsusceptible P. aeruginosa (MIC50/MIC90, 4/16 mug/ml; 87.3% inhibited at </=8 mug/ml). Acinetobacter spp. (ceftazidime-avibactam MIC50/MIC90, 16/>32 mug/ml) showed high rates of resistance to most tested agents. In summary, ceftazidime-avibactam demonstrated potent activity against a large collection of contemporary Gram-negative bacilli isolated from patients in U.S. hospitals in 2012, including organisms that are resistant to most currently available agents, such as K. pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing Enterobacteriaceae and meropenem-nonsusceptible P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Phytostabilization of moderate copper contaminated soils using co-inoculation of  Vicia faba with plant growth promoting bacteria.
AB  - There is a need to conduct research on the selection of microbial isolates from rhizosphere of plants growing on heavy metal contaminated soils for specific restoration programs. This article suggest a consortium of bacteria combining Rhizobium sp. CCNWSX0481, Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. viciae, Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas sp. 2(2010) that was examined for the ability to promote Vicia faba.L. growth when cultivated on the vineyard of soil moderately contaminated with copper. Data showed that inoculation was significant in nodulation; it increases the number and the weight of nodules of 50%. Co-inoculation was also found to positively influence growth and seed yield, through increasing fresh shoot and fresh root weights by 33 and 26%, respectively, and through rising numbers of seed per pod and pods per plant. In contrast, co-inoculation produced a significant reduction of accumulated copper in roots attending 35%, however, the treatment revealed no significant effects on the copper contents in pods and seeds. The tested inoculum could be an option to promote V. faba growth and to enhance soil fertilization in moderate copper contaminated soils. Further studies on the influence of co-inoculation practices on copper migration in soil-plant systems are recommended to acquire more information for evaluation of this legume safety.
TI  - [Diversity analysis of biofilm bacteria on tracheal tubes removed from intubated  neonates].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The catheter-related infections caused by mechanical ventilation have  become a intractable clinical problem, and it is related to the formation of bacterial biofilm (BF) on the surface of the implanted material. The majority of natural biofilms are formed by multiple bacterial species. However, there always only one or limited species were detected on tracheal tubes removed from intubated neonates by using traditional methods including bacterium culture and antigen detection. The aims of this study were to observe the bacterial communities diversity of BF on endotracheal tube (ETT), and discuss the difference between traditional bacterium culture methods and the use of molecular biology techniques on the basis of denatured gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), to provide new ideas for clinical prevention, diagnosis and treatment of bacterial infections. METHOD: Thirty-five ETTs were obtained from 26 neonates on mechanical ventilator (from October 2012 to March 2013) in Department of Neonatology of Children's Hospital. Among the patients, 18 were boys and 8 girls, and 19 patients were < 37 weeks gestational age and 7 patients >/= 37 weeks. DGGE profiling of 16S rDNA gene amplicons was used to assess the diversity of the bacterial population by using the software of quantity one. TA Cloning Kit and sequencing were used to investigate the distribution of bacteria and common dominant bacteria in ETT-BF. RESULT: The mean bands of 35 ETTs cases were 13.8 +/- 5.4 from 16S rDNA PCR-DGGE, and the mean Shanon-Wiener indexes was 2.42 +/- 0.38. The 16 ETTs were collected in different stages of diseases from the 7 patients. The indwelling days of 6/7 patients' ETTs increased, the Shanon-siener indexes were decreased. Among the 6 cases from different basic illnesses, and there were different Shanon-siener indexes. The result of molecular cloning and sequencing for 24 dominant bands showed that 35 cases (100%) contained Klebsiella SP., 28 cases (80%) had Pseudomonas SP., 27 cases (77%) had Streptococcus SP., and 32 cases (91%) had Uncultured bacterium, while more than 2 bacterial species were found in 34 cases (97%). 28/35 (80%) Klebsiella SP. and 22/27(82%) Streptococcus SP. were accompanied by Pseudomonas SP.. There were 22 positive results of sputum culture from 26 newborns, including 10 strains (45%) of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 2 strains (9%) of Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterobacter cloacae and non-cultured bacterium in each patient (5%), but only one bacterium isolated from every sputum. Eight sputum samples had normal flora only, corresponding to the ETTs on which Klebsiella and other bacterial genuses were found. CONCLUSION: The diversity of microbiota in BF on ETT was confirmed. 16S rDNA PCR-DGGE could produce a more complete picture of bacterial community than traditional bacterium culture method. Klebsiella, Pseudomonas and Streptococcus were common dominant bacteria in ETT-BF, and there might be interactions among them in the formation of BF.
TI  - Brood ball-mediated transmission of microbiome members in the dung beetle, Onthophagus taurus (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae).
AB  - Insects feeding on plant sap, blood, and other nutritionally incomplete diets are typically associated with mutualistic bacteria that supplement missing nutrients. Herbivorous mammal dung contains more than 86% cellulose and lacks amino acids essential for insect development and reproduction. Yet one of the most ecologically necessary and evolutionarily successful groups of beetles, the dung beetles (Scarabaeinae) feeds primarily, or exclusively, on dung. These associations suggest that dung beetles may benefit from mutualistic bacteria that provide nutrients missing from dung. The nesting behaviors of the female parent and the feeding behaviors of the larvae suggest that a microbiome could be vertically transmitted from the parental female to her offspring through the brood ball. Using sterile rearing and a combination of molecular and culture-based techniques, we examine transmission of the microbiome in the bull-headed dung beetle, Onthophagus taurus. Beetles were reared on autoclaved dung and the microbiome was characterized across development. A ~1425 bp region of the 16S rRNA identified Pseudomonadaceae, Enterobacteriaceae, and Comamonadaceae as the most common bacterial families across all life stages and populations, including cultured isolates from the 3(rd) instar digestive system. Finer level phylotyping analyses based on lepA and gyrB amplicons of cultured isolates placed the isolates closest to Enterobacter cloacae, Providencia stuartii, Pusillimonas sp., Pedobacter heparinus, and Lysinibacillus sphaericus. Scanning electron micrographs of brood balls constructed from sterile dung reveals secretions and microbes only in the chamber the female prepares for the egg. The use of autoclaved dung for rearing, the presence of microbes in the brood ball and offspring, and identical 16S rRNA sequences in both parent and offspring suggests that the O. taurus female parent transmits specific microbiome members to her offspring through the brood chamber. The transmission of the dung beetle microbiome highlights the maintenance and likely importance of this newly-characterized bacterial community.
TI  - Resistance and inactivation kinetics of bacterial strains isolated from the non-chlorinated and chlorinated effluents of a WWTP.
AB  - The microbiological quality of water from a wastewater treatment plant that uses  sodium hypochlorite as a disinfectant was assessed. Mesophilic aerobic bacteria were not removed efficiently. This fact allowed for the isolation of several bacterial strains from the effluents. Molecular identification indicated that the strains were related to Aeromonas hydrophila, Escherichia coli (three strains), Enterobacter cloacae, Kluyvera cryocrescens (three strains), Kluyvera intermedia, Citrobacter freundii (two strains), Bacillus sp. and Enterobacter sp. The first five strains, which were isolated from the non-chlorinated effluent, were used to test resistance to chlorine disinfection using three sets of variables: disinfectant concentration (8, 20 and 30 mg.L(-1)), contact time (0, 15 and 30 min) and water temperature (20, 25 and 30 degrees C). The results demonstrated that the strains have independent responses to experimental conditions and that the most efficient treatment was an 8 mg.L(-1) dose of disinfectant at a temperature of 20 degrees C for 30 min. The other eight strains, which were isolated from the chlorinated effluent, were used to analyze inactivation kinetics using the disinfectant at a dose of 15 mg.L(-1) with various retention times (0, 10, 20, 30, 60 and 90 min). The results indicated that during the inactivation process, there was no relationship between removal percentage and retention time and that the strains have no common response to the treatments.
TI  - Purification and characterization of a GH43 beta-xylosidase from Enterobacter sp. identified and cloned from forest soil bacteria.
AB  - The use of lignocellulosic biomass for second generation biofuels requires optimization of enzymatic breakdown of plant cell walls. In this work, cellulolytic bacteria were isolated from a native and two cultivated forest soil samples. Amplification of glycosyl hydrolases was attempted by using a low stringency-degenerate primer PCR strategy, using total soil DNA and bulk DNA pooled from positive colonies as template. A set of primers was designed based on Acidothermus cellulolyticus genome, by search of conserved domains of glycosyl hydrolases (GH) families of interest. Using this approach, a fragment containing an open reading frame (ORF) with 98% identity to a putative GH43 beta-xylosidase coding gene from Enterobacter cloacae was amplified and cloned. The full protein was expressed in Escherichia coli as N-terminal or C-terminal His-tagged fusions and purified under native conditions. Only N-terminal fusion protein, His-Xyl43, presented beta-xylosidase activity. On pNPX, optimal activity was achieved at pH 6 and 40 degrees C and Km and Kcat values were 2.92 mM and 1.32 seg(-1), respectively. Activity was also demonstrated on xylobiose (X2), with Km 17.8 mM and Kcat 380 s(-1). These results demonstrated that Xyl43 is a functional beta-xylosidase and it is the first evidence of this activity for Enterobacter sp.
TI  - Histo-blood group antigen-like substances of human enteric bacteria as specific adsorbents for human noroviruses.
AB  - Histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs) have been suggested to be receptors or coreceptors for human noroviruses (HuNoVs) expressed on the intestinal epithelium. We isolated an enteric bacterium strain (SENG-6), closely related to Enterobacter cloacae, bearing HBGA-like substances from a fecal sample of a healthy individual by using a biopanning technique with anti-HBGA antibodies. The binding capacities of four genotypes of norovirus-like particles (NoVLPs) to Enterobacter sp. SENG-6 cells were confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Transmission electron microscopy demonstrated that NoVLPs bound mainly to extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) of Enterobacter sp. SENG-6, where the HBGA-like substances were localized. EPS that contained HBGA-like substances extracted from Enterobacter sp. SENG-6 was shown by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to be capable of binding to NoVLPs of a GI.1 wild-type strain (8fIIa) and a GII.6 strain that can recognize A antigen but not to an NoVLP GI.1 mutant strain (W375A) that loses the ability to bind to A antigen. Enzymatic cleavage of terminal N-acetyl-galactosamine residues in the bacterial EPS weakened bacterial EPS binding to the GI.1 wild-type strain (8fIIa). These results indicate that A-like substances in the bacterial EPS play a key role in binding to NoVLPs. Since the specific binding of HuNoVs to HBGA-positive enteric bacteria is likely to affect the transmission and infection processes of HuNoVs in their hosts and in the environment, further studies of human enteric bacteria and their binding capacity to HuNoVs will provide a new scientific platform for understanding interactions between two types of microbes that were previously regarded as biologically unrelated.
TI  - Enterobacter siamensis sp. nov., a transglutaminase-producing bacterium isolated  from seafood processing wastewater in Thailand.
AB  - A novel strain of Enterobacter, C2361(T), a Gram-negative, non-spore-forming, rod-shaped and facultative anaerobic bacterium with the capability to produce transglutaminase, was isolated from seafood processing wastewater collected from a treatment pond of a seafood factory in Songkhla Province, Thailand. Phylogenetic analyses and phenotypic characteristics, including chemotaxonomic characteristics, showed that the strain was a member of the genus Enterobacter. The 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities between strain C2361(T) and Enterobacter cloacae subsp. cloacae ATCC 13047(T) and Enterobacter cloacae subsp. dissolvens LMG 2683(T) were 97.5 and 97.5%, respectively. Strain C2361(T) showed a low DNA-DNA relatedness with the above-mentioned species. The major fatty acids were C16:0, C17:0cyclo and C14:0. The DNA G+C content was 53.0 mol%. On the basis of the polyphasic evidence gathered in this study, it should be classified as a novel species of the genus Enterobacter for which the name Enterobacter siamensis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is C2361(T) (= KCTC 23282(T) = NBRC 107138(T)).
TI  - Isolation and characterization of a glyphosate-degrading rhizosphere strain, Enterobacter cloacae K7.
AB  - Plant-growth-promoting rhizobacteria exert beneficial effects on plants through their capacity for nitrogen fixation, phytohormone production, phosphate solubilization, and improvement of the water and mineral status of plants. We suggested that these bacteria may also have the potential to express degradative activity toward glyphosate, a commonly used organophosphorus herbicide. In this study, 10 strains resistant to a 10 mM concentration of glyphosate were isolated from the rhizoplane of various plants. Five of these strains--Alcaligenes sp. K1, Comamonas sp. K4, Azomonas sp. K5, Pseudomonas sp. K3, and Enterobacter cloacae K7--possessed a number of associative traits, including fixation of atmospheric nitrogen, solubilization of phosphates, and synthesis of the phytohormone indole-3-acetic acid. One strain, E. cloacae K7, could utilize glyphosate as a source of P. Gas-liquid chromatography showed that E. cloacae growth correlated with a decline in herbicide content in the culture medium (40% of the initial 5mM content), with no glyphosate accumulating inside the cells. Thin-layer chromatography analysis of the intermediate metabolites of glyphosate degradation found that E. cloacae K7 had a C-P lyase activity and degraded glyphosate to give sarcosine, which was then oxidized to glycine. In addition, strain K7 colonized the roots of common sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) and sugar sorghum (Sorghum saccharatum Pers.), promoting the growth and development of sunflower seedlings. Our findings extend current knowledge of glyphosate-degrading rhizosphere bacteria and may be useful for developing a biotechnology for the cleanup and restoration of glyphosate-polluted soils.
TI  - Diversity of the bacterial and fungal microflora from the midgut and cuticle of phlebotomine sand flies collected in North-Western Iran.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Phlebotomine sand flies are the vectors of the leishmaniases, parasitic diseases caused by Leishmania spp. Little is known about the prevalence and diversity of sand fly microflora colonizing the midgut or the cuticle. Particularly, there is little information on the fungal diversity. This information is important for development of vector control strategies. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: FIVE SAND FLY SPECIES: Phlebotomus papatasi, P. sergenti, P. kandelakii, P. perfiliewi and P. halepensis were caught in Bileh Savar and Kaleybar in North-Western Iran that are located in endemic foci of visceral leishmaniasis. A total of 35 specimens were processed. Bacterial and fungal strains were identified by routine microbiological methods. We characterized 39 fungal isolates from the cuticle and/or the midgut. They belong to six different genera including Penicillium (17 isolates), Aspergillus (14), Acremonium (5), Fusarium (1), Geotrichum (1) and Candida (1). We identified 33 Gram-negative bacteria: Serratia marcescens (9 isolates), Enterobacter cloacae (6), Pseudomonas fluorescens (6), Klebsiella ozaenae (4), Acinetobacter sp. (3), Escherichia coli (3), Asaia sp. (1) and Pantoea sp. (1) as well as Gram-positive bacteria Bacillus subtilis (5) and Micrococcus luteus (5) in 10 isolates. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Our study provides new data on the microbiotic diversity of field-collected sand flies and for the first time, evidence of the presence of Asaia sp. in sand flies. We have also found a link between physiological stages (unfed, fresh fed, semi gravid and gravid) of sand flies and number of bacteria that they carry. Interestingly Pantoea sp. and Klebsiella ozaenae have been isolated in Old World sand fly species. The presence of latter species on sand fly cuticle and in the female midgut suggests a role for this arthropod in dissemination of these pathogenic bacteria in endemic areas. Further experiments are required to clearly delineate the vectorial role (passive or active) of sand flies.
TI  - Verification of monoplex and multiplex linear-after-the-exponential PCR gene-specific sepsis assays using clinical isolates.
AB  - AIMS: To verify monoplex and multiplex gene-specific linear-after-the-exponential polymerase chain reaction (LATE-PCR) assays for identifying 17 microbial pathogens (i.e., Klebsiella sp., Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter sp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, coagulase negative staphylococci, Enterococcus sp., Candida sp.) commonly associated with septicaemia using clinical isolates. METHODS AND RESULTS: Clinical isolates of each target pathogen were collected from the University of California, Davis Medical Center (UCDMC) microbiology laboratory. Five microlitres (mul) of each culture suspension (1 x 10(8) CFU ml(-1) ) were added to 20 mul of monoplex mastermix. DNA extracted from clinical isolates was tested in multiplex. Monoplex assays demonstrated 100% sensitivity at this input level, except Enterobacter cloacae (2.7%), Ac. baumannii (57%) and Ps. aeruginosa (97.8%). All clinical isolates were positive in multiplex, with the exception of two Ac. baumannii, two Klebsiella oxytoca and two Candida parapsilosis isolates. CONCLUSIONS: Sixteen pathogens can be identified by monoplex LATE-PCR assays with sensitivities >/= 97.8%. The multiplex assay demonstrated 91.4% sensitivity when tested with DNA extracted from 70 different target strains. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study demonstrates the potential of LATE-PCR to serve as an adjunct to culture if the reagents are optimized for sensitivity. Results warrant further testing through analytical and clinical validation of the multiplex assay.
TI  - Discrimination of selected species of pathogenic bacteria using near-infrared Raman spectroscopy and principal components analysis.
AB  - ABSTRACT. A method, based on Raman spectroscopy, for identification of different  microorganisms involved in bacterial urinary tract infections has been proposed. Spectra were collected from different bacterial colonies (Gram-negative: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter cloacae, and Gram-positive: Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus spp.), grown on culture medium (agar), using a Raman spectrometer with a fiber Raman probe (830 nm). Colonies were scraped from the agar surface and placed on an aluminum foil for Raman measurements. After preprocessing, spectra were submitted to a principal component analysis and Mahalanobis distance (PCA/MD) discrimination algorithm. We found that the mean Raman spectra of different bacterial species show similar bands, and S. aureus was well characterized by strong bands related to carotenoids. PCA/MD could discriminate Gram-positive bacteria with sensitivity and specificity of 100% and Gram-negative bacteria with sensitivity ranging from 58 to 88% and specificity ranging from 87% to 99%.
TI  - Root colonization and growth promotion of sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) by phosphate solubilizing Enterobacter sp. Fs-11.
AB  - An Enterobacter sp. Fs-11 was isolated from sunflower rhizosphere, identified on  the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis (GeneBank accession no. GQ179978) and studied for its root colonization and growth promotion ability in sunflower. Morphologically, it was rod shaped Gram-negative, motile bacterium, producing 4.5 mug mL(-1) indole acetic acid in tryptophan-supplemented medium. It utilized 27 out of 95 substrates in BIOLOG GN2 micro plate system. It was able to convert insoluble tri-calcium phosphate to soluble phosphorus up to 43.5 mug mL(-1) with decrease in pH of the medium up to 4.5 after 10 days incubation at 28 +/- 2 degrees C in the Pikovskaya's broth. High performance liquid chromatography of cell free supernatant showed that Fs-11 produced malic acid and gluconic acid (2.43 and 16.64 mug mL(-1), respectively) in Pikovskaya's broth. Analysis of 900 bp fragment of pyrroloquinoline quinine pqqE gene sequence showed 98 % homology with that of E. cloacae pqqE gene. Confocal laser scanning microscope revealed strong colonization of fluorescently labeled Fs-11 with sunflower roots. Sunflower inoculation with Fs-11 and its rifampicin resistant derivative in sterile sand and natural soil showed that Fs-11 colonized sunflower roots up to 30 days after transplanting in both sterile sand as well as natural soil. Moreover, Fs-11 inoculation resulted in increased plant height, fresh weight, dry weight and total phosphorus contents as compared to un-inoculated plants. The data showed that Enterobacter sp. Fs-11 is an efficient phosphate solubilizing and plant growth promoting rhizobacterium and has great potential to be used as bio-inoculant for sunflower under phosphorus deficient conditions.
TI  - Characterization of RarA, a novel AraC family multidrug resistance regulator in Klebsiella pneumoniae.
AB  - Transcriptional regulators, such as SoxS, RamA, MarA, and Rob, which upregulate the AcrAB efflux pump, have been shown to be associated with multidrug resistance in clinically relevant Gram-negative bacteria. In addition to the multidrug resistance phenotype, these regulators have also been shown to play a role in the cellular metabolism and possibly the virulence potential of microbial cells. As such, the increased expression of these proteins is likely to cause pleiotropic phenotypes. Klebsiella pneumoniae is a major nosocomial pathogen which can express the SoxS, MarA, Rob, and RamA proteins, and the accompanying paper shows that the increased transcription of ramA is associated with tigecycline resistance (M. Veleba and T. Schneiders, Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 56:4466-4467, 2012). Bioinformatic analyses of the available Klebsiella genome sequences show that an additional AraC-type regulator is encoded chromosomally. In this work, we characterize this novel AraC-type regulator, hereby called RarA (Regulator of antibiotic resistance A), which is encoded in K. pneumoniae, Enterobacter sp. 638, Serratia proteamaculans 568, and Enterobacter cloacae. We show that the overexpression of rarA results in a multidrug resistance phenotype which requires a functional AcrAB efflux pump but is independent of the other AraC regulators. Quantitative real-time PCR experiments show that rarA (MGH 78578 KPN_02968) and its neighboring efflux pump operon oqxAB (KPN_02969_02970) are consistently upregulated in clinical isolates collected from various geographical locations (Chile, Turkey, and Germany). Our results suggest that rarA overexpression upregulates the oqxAB efflux pump. Additionally, it appears that oqxR, encoding a GntR-type regulator adjacent to the oqxAB operon, is able to downregulate the expression of the oqxAB efflux pump, where OqxR complementation resulted in reductions to olaquindox MICs.
TI  - Biodegradation of s-triazine herbicide atrazine by Enterobacter cloacae and Burkholderia cepacia sp. from long-term treated sugarcane-cultivated soils in Kenya.
AB  - In this study soils from sugarcane-cultivated fields were screened for bacterial  species capable of atrazine (6-chloro-N(2)-ethyl-N(4)-isopropyl-1,3,5-triazine-2,4-diamine) degradation due to long exposure of the soils to this herbicide. To enrich for atrazine degraders, Minimal Salt Medium containing atrazine as the sole N source and glucose as the C source was inoculated with soils impacted with this herbicide and incubated. Bacterial growth was monitored by measuring optical density. The degradation of atrazine was followed by measuring residual atrazine in liquid cultures over a given time period by high performance liquid chromatography. Bacterial strains isolated from the enrichment cultures were characterized by biochemical tests and identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Two bacterial strains coded ISL 8 and ISL 15 isolated from two different fields were shown to have 94 and 96% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity to Burkholderia cepacia respectively. Another bacterial sp., ISL 14 was closely related to Enterobacter cloacae with a 96% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity. There was not much difference between the extents of atrazine degradation by the enrichment cultures with communities (79-82% applied amount) from which pure strains were isolated and the pure strains themselves in liquid cultures that showed a degradation of 53-83% of applied amount. The study showed existence of bacterial strains in different sugarcane-cultivated fields which can use atrazine as a nitrogen source. The bacterial strains isolated can be used to enhance the degradation of atrazine in contaminated soils where atrazine is still considered to be recalcitrant.
TI  - Nonrecovery of varying proportions of viable bacteria during spread plating governed by the extent of spreader usage and proposal for an alternate spotting-spreading approach to maximize the CFU.
AB  - AIMS: To elucidate the cause of high variations and inconsistencies in bacterial  CFU observed within and between different experiments while assessing viable bacterial counts through spread plating (SP). METHODS AND RESULTS: Following the inconsistent results, CFU estimations were undertaken through conventional SP using the spreader, or a modified approach that did not use spreader employing four organisms. The latter approach involving spotting-and-tilt-spreading of inoculum on agar surface [spotting spreading (SS)] yielded higher CFU by 11-120% over the weighted average depending on the organism and diluent. The adverse effect owing to the spreader was the most obvious in Escherichia coli followed by Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterobacter cloacae and Bacillus pumilus. Plate attributes that determined the surface moisture levels of agar medium and the spreading practice adopted by the personnel formed two other major influencing factors. Plating for shorter periods (<60 s) using fresh 15/20 ml plates caused loss of 3-12% CFU owing to inoculum adhesion to spreader irrespective of glass or polypropylene make. On the other hand, prolonging the plating brought down the CFU significantly. Spreader movement on agar surface subsequent to the exhaustion of free moisture, which was marked by the experiencing of some friction to smooth spreader movement, was detrimental to vegetative cells, while Bacillus spores were less affected. CONCLUSIONS: The study brings out that the way SP is carried out exerts significant effects on CFU influenced by plate conditions. Prolonged use of spreader on dry agar surface could be highly detrimental to bacterial cells. A mild use of spreader accounting for spreader-adhering inoculum or the practice of SS not involving the spreader is recommended. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study unravels the effects owing to the spreader on bacterial cells and the CFU and recommends an alternate approach of SS to minimize CFU inconsistencies and to maximize the viable bacterial counts.
TI  - New role of antibody in bacterial isolation.
AB  - To eliminate the interference caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the isolation of Salmonella, a rabbit polyclonal antibody against P. aeruginosa was prepared by inoculating four New Zealand rabbits with the pathogen. The antiserum was purified using saturated ammonium sulfate and added into Rappaport-Vassiliadis medium with soya (RVS) broth and Muller-Kauffmann tetrathionate novobiocin broth (MKTTn broth) to evaluate whether it could inhibit the growth of P. aeruginosa. Observations by scanning electron microscopy demonstrated that P. aeruginosa was attacked and destroyed by the antibody when incubated for 10 min at 37 degrees C. The activity of the antibody was also effective against 11 other strains of P. aeruginosa. Twenty-six strains of Salmonella were mixed with P. aeruginosa in RVS and MKTTn broth at 37 degrees C for 12 h, respectively, and the cultures were plated on Salmonella chromogenic medium (SCM; Oxoid, Basingstoke, UK). Only Salmonella grew on SCM; five colonies were randomly selected for identification by VITEK 2 (bioMerieux, Lyon, France). Additionally, when mixed with two strains of Enterobacter cloacae (ATCC 700323 and YG001), the prepared antibody did not affect the growth of E. cloacae. The results demonstrated that the microbicidal activity of the antibody did not affect the tested Salmonella sp. or E. cloacae strains. Therefore, the antibody generated could be used to increase the accuracy of Salmonella isolation.
TI  - Temporal variation of microbiological and chemical quality of noncarbonated bottled drinking water sold in Sri Lanka.
AB  - Use of bottled water in Sri Lanka has increased over the last decade, while new brands of bottled water are often introduced to the market. However, the manufacturers' adherence to bottled water regulations is questionable, raising concerns regarding the quality of bottled water. The objective of the current study was to investigate the microbiological and chemical quality of bottled water in Sri Lanka. Thirty bottled water brands were sampled and their chemical and microbiological parameters were analyzed. Microbiological analysis was carried out within 1 to 3, 3 to 6, 6 to 9, and 9 to 12 mo after the date of manufacture. The results indicated that 63% of brands tested exceeded the levels permitted by the Sri Lanka Standards Institution (SLSI) for presumptive total coliforms (TC) (<10 cfu per 100 mL) whereas 97% brands exceeded the World Health Organization (WHO) permitted level. Thirty percent of brands exceeded the limit for presumptive fecal coliforms (FC) (0 cfu per 100 mL in accordance with WHO permitted levels, SLSI and the Sri Lanka Health Ministry requirement). Eighty percent of brands showed higher heterotrophic plate counts (HPC) which exceeded the WHO guidelines for bottled drinking water. Throughout their shelf life, the counts of TC, FC, and HPC bacteria decreased. Bacteria identified were Klebsiella pneumoniae ssp. pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Pasteurella haemolytica, the most frequently being P. aeruginosa. The dominant fungi identified were Aspergillus sp. and Penicillium sp. Inorganic chemical parameters were within permitted levels for all brands except for initial content of ammonia. The results of this study show the need for the bottling industry to be monitored closely by relevant authorities, in order to provide safe bottled drinking water to consumers in Sri Lanka.
TI  - Chromate-resistance genes in plasmids from antibiotic-resistant nosocomial enterobacterial isolates.
AB  - The presence of chromate-resistance genes in enterobacteria was evaluated in a collection of 109 antibiotic-resistant nosocomial isolates from nine major cities in Mexico. Results were compared with the presence of mercury-resistance genes. Susceptibility tests showed that 21% of the isolates were resistant to chromate (Cr(R)), whereas 36% were resistant to mercury (Hg(R)). Cr(R) levels were high in Klebsiella pneumoniae (61%), low in Enterobacter cloacae (12%) and Escherichia coli (4%), and null in Salmonella sp. isolates. Colony hybridization demonstrated that the majority of metal-resistant isolates hybridized with chrA gene (87% of Cr(R) isolates), encoding a CHR transporter homologue, and merA gene (74% of Hg(R) isolates), encoding MerA mercuric reductase, suggesting that most isolates expressed these widespread metal-resistance systems. Southern blot hybridization of Cr(R) isolates showed that plasmids of 80, 85, and 95 kb from K. pneumoniae isolates, and of 100 kb from an E. cloacae isolate, contained chrA-related sequences. These plasmids belonged to IncN or IncP incompatibility groups, and conferred Cr(R), as well as multiple antibiotic resistance, when transferred by conjugation to an E. coli standard strain. These data indicated that Cr(R) genes may be distributed among clinical enterobacteria via conjugative plasmids, probably by coselection with antibiotic-resistant genes.
TI  - Genetic diversity of endophytic diazotrophs of the wild rice, Oryza alta and identification of the new diazotroph, Acinetobacter oryzae sp. nov.
AB  - Thirty-three endophytic diazotrophs were isolated from surface-sterilized leaves, stem, and roots of wild rice Oryza alta. The SDS-PAGE profile of total protein and insertion sequence-based polymerase chain reaction (IS-PCR) fingerprinting grouped the isolates into four clusters (I-IV). The 16S rRNA gene sequence homology of the representative strains B21, B31, B1, and B23 of clusters I, II, III, and IV were assigned to Pseudomonas oleovorans (99.2% similarity), Burkholderia fungorum (99.4% similarity), Enterobacter cloacae (98.9% similarity), and Acinetobacter johnsonii (98.4% similarity), respectively. The results showed wide genetic diversity of the putative diazotrophic strains of the wild rice, O. alta, and the strains of cluster IV are the first report of nitrogen-fixing Acinetobacter species. The cell size, phenotypic characters, total protein profile, genomic DNA fingerprinting, DNA-DNA hybridization, and antibiotic resistance differentiated strain B23(T) from its closest relatives A. johnsonii LMG999(T) and Acinetobacter haemolyticus LMG996(T). The DNA-DNA hybridization also distinguished the strain B23(T) from the closely related Acinetobacter species. Based on these data, a novel species, Acinetobacter oryzae sp. nov., and strain B23(T) (=LMG25575(T) = CGMCC1.10689(T)) as the type strain were proposed.
TI  - Influence of consumption of probiotics on presence of enterobacteria in the oral  cavity.
AB  - Clinical benefits of probiotics have been clearly reported in different gastrointestinal disorders, many of them caused by enterobacteria. The oral cavity is a port of entry and can be an important reservoir of these microorganisms. This work evaluated whether consumption of probiotics was able to influence the presence of enterobacteria in the oral cavity and the specific secretory response against these microorganisms. Saliva samples of healthy individuals were collected and plated in MacConkey agar. Carriers of Gram-negative, rod-shaped microorganisms in the oral cavity were selected and instructed to use the probiotic Yakult LB for 20 days. Saliva was then collected and enterobacteria species were identified using the API 20 E system and by ELISA using anti-enterobacteria IgA. The results showed reduction in the prevalence of enterobacteria, but no significant changes in enterobacterial counts (log CFU/mL; p = 0.3457). The species most frequently isolated were Enterobacter cloacae and Klebsiella oxytoca, both before and after probiotic consumption. No significant changes were observed in anti-enterobacteria IgA levels. In conclusion, probiotic consumption had some influence on enterobacterial presence in the oral cavity, but did not affect enterobacterial counts or the specific immune secretory response against them.
TI  - Rectal carriage of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing gram-negative bacilli in community settings in Madagascar.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Extended-spectrum ss-lactamase-producing Enterobacteria (ESBL-PE) emerged at the end of the 1980s, causing nosocomial outbreaks and/or hyperendemic situations in hospitals and long-term care facilities. In recent years, community-acquired infections due to ESBL-PE have spread worldwide, especially across developing countries including Madagascar. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to determine the prevalence and risk factors of intestinal carriage of ESBL-PE in the community of Antananarivo. METHODS: Non-hospitalized patients were recruited in three health centers in different socio economic settings. Fresh stool collected were immediately plated on Drigalski agar containing 3 mg/liter of ceftriaxone. Gram-negative bacilli species were identified and ESBL production was tested by a double disk diffusion (cefotaxime and ceftazidime +/- clavulanate) assay. Characterization of ESBLs were perfomed by PCR and direct sequencing. Molecular epidemiology was analysed by Rep-PCR and ERIC-PCR. RESULTS: 484 patients were screened (sex ratio = 1.03, median age 28 years). 53 ESBL-PE were isolated from 49 patients (carrier rate 10.1%). The isolates included Escherichia coli (31), Klebsiella pneumoniae (14), Enterobacter cloacae (3), Citrobacter freundii (3), Kluyvera spp. (1) and Pantoae sp. (1). In multivariate analysis, only the socioeconomic status of the head of household was independently associated with ESBL-PE carriage, poverty being the predominant risk factor. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of carriage of ESBL in the community of Antananarivo is one of the highest reported worldwide. This alarming spread of resistance genes should be stopped urgently by improving hygiene and streamlining the distribution and consumption of antibiotics.
TI  - Outbreak of a novel Enterobacter sp. carrying blaCTX-M-15 in a neonatal unit of a tertiary care hospital in Tanzania.
AB  - Enterobacter hormaechei and Cronobacter sakazakii are amongst the most important  causes of outbreaks of neonatal sepsis associated with powdered milk. In this study, we report for the first time an outbreak of a novel Enterobacter sp. harbouring bla(CTX-M-15) in a neonatal unit in Tanzania. Seventeen Gram-negative enteric isolates from neonatal blood cultures were studied. Antibiotic susceptibility was assessed by disc diffusion testing, and the presence of the bla(CTX-M-15) gene was established by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing. Isolates were typed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Identification by biochemical profiling was followed by nucleotide sequencing of 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA), rpoB and hsp60 alleles. Environmental sampling was done and control measures were established. Isolates were initially misidentified based on their fermentation characteristics and agglutination as Salmonella enterica serotype Paratyphi. All isolates were resistant to multiple antibiotics, except for ciprofloxacin and carbapenems, and were found to harbour bla(CTX-M-15) on a 291-kb narrow-range plasmid. PFGE analysis indicated the clonal outbreak of a single strain, infecting 17 neonates with a case fatality rate of 35%. The same strain was isolated from a milk bucket. Phylogenetic analysis using 16S rDNA, rpoB and hsp60 sequences permitted no definitive identification, clustering the strains in the Enterobacter cloacae complex with similarities of 92-98.8%. The data describe an outbreak of a novel bla(CTX-M-15)-positive, multiresistant Enterobacter strain in an African neonatal unit that can easily be misidentified taxonomically. These data highlight the need for constant surveillance of bacteria harbouring extended-spectrum beta-lactamases as well as improvements in hygiene measures in developing countries.
TI  - The influence of environmental bacteria in freshwater stingray wound-healing.
AB  - Invasion by bacteria can influence the course of healing of wounds acquired in aquatic environment. In this study, the bacteria present in Potamotrygon motoro stingray mucus and in the Alto Parana river water were identified, and their ability to induce tissue injury and resist antibiotics was determined. Biochemical identification analysis showed that 97% of all bacterial isolates were Gram negative, Aeromonas spp., Enterobacter cloacae and Citrobacter freundii being the species most prevalent. Gelatinase and caseinase were produced by Aeromonas hydrophila, Aeromonas sobria and Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains. Erythrocyte hemolysis assay showed that A. sobria, A. hydrophila and to a lesser extent, other Gram-negative bacteria produced hemolysin. It was also observed that molecules released in culture by these bacteria were toxic to human epithelial cells. Antibiogram results showed that 68% of all bacterial isolates were resistant to at least one type of antibiotic, mainly B-lactams. Finally, it was demonstrated that although P. motoro venom was toxic to epithelial cells it did not influence bacterial proliferation. In summary, the results obtained in this work indicate that during the accident, the mucus of P. motoro and the environmental water may transfer into the wound pathogenic multi-resistant bacteria with the potential to cause severe secondary infections.
TI  - Biosurfactant production under extreme environmental conditions by an efficient microbial consortium, ERCPPI-2.
AB  - The biosurfactant production potential of a new microbial consortium of Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas sp. (ERCPPI-2) which was isolated from heavy crude oil-contaminated soil in the south of Iran, has been investigated under extreme environmental conditions. The isolated consortium produces a biosurfactant mixture with excessive oil spreading and emulsification properties. This consortium was able to grow and produce biosurfactant at temperatures up to 70 degrees C, pressures up to 6000 psia, salinities up to 15% (w/v), and in the pH range 4-10. Besides, the optimum biosurfactant production conditions were found to be 40 degrees C and 7.0 for the temperature and pH value, respectively. These conditions gave the best biosurfactant production of 1.74 g/1 when the cells were grown on a minimal salt medium containing 1.0% (w/v) olive oil, 1.0% (w/v) sodium nitrate supplemented with 1.39% (w/v) K(2)HPO(4) at 40 degrees C and 150 rpm after 48 h of incubation. The ERCPPI-2 could reduce surface and interfacial tensions to 31.7 and 0.65 mN/m from the original values of 58.3 and 16.9 mN/m, respectively. The isolated consortium produced biosurfactant using heavy crude oil as the sole source of carbon and emulsified the available heavy crude oil up to E(24)=83.4%. The results of the core holder flooding tests at simulated reservoir conditions demonstrated that the oil recovery efficiency due to the injection of the cell-free biosurfactant solution was 27.2%, and the bacterium injection reduced the final residual oil saturations to below 3% at optimum conditions.
TI  - Enriched microbial community in bioaugmentation of petroleum-contaminated soil in the presence of wheat straw.
AB  - The bioaugmentation of petroleum-contaminated soil using Enterobacter cloacae was profiled from the evolution of microbial community, soil dehydrogenase activity, to the degradation of petroleum contaminants. The seeding and proliferation of inoculant and the consequential microbial community were monitored by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis of the amplification of V3 zone of 16S rDNA. Degradation process kinetics was characterized by the degradation ratio of nC17 to nC18. The dehydrogenase activity was also determined during the degradation process. An abrupt change in the microbial community after inoculation was illustrated as well as successive changes in response to degradation of the petroleum contaminants. Seeding with E. cloacae stimulated the growth of other degrading stains such as Pseudomonas sp. and Rhodothermus sp. The application of wheat straw as a representative lignin waste, at 5% (w/w), induced an increase in the total dehydrogenase activity from 0.50 to 0.79, an increase in the microbial content of 130% for bacteria and 84% for fungi, and an increase of the overall degradation ratio from 44% to 56% after 56 days of treatment. The above mentioned results have provided a microbial ecological insight being essential for the design and implementation of bioaugmentation processes.
TI  - Enterobacter mori sp. nov., associated with bacterial wilt on Morus alba L.
AB  - Two isolates of mulberry-pathogenic bacteria isolated from diseased mulberry roots were investigated in a polyphasic taxonomic study. Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis combined with rpoB gene sequence analysis allocated strains R18-2(T) and R3-3 to the genus Enterobacter, with Enterobacter asburiae, E. amnigenus, E. cancerogenus, E. cloacae subsp. cloacae, E. cloacae subsp. dissolvens and E. nimipressuralis as their closest relatives. Cells of the isolates were Gram-negative, facultatively anaerobic rods, 0.3-1.0 microm wide and 0.8-2.0 microm long, with peritrichous flagella, showing a DNA G+C content of 55.1 +/- 0.5 mol%. Calculation of a similarity index based on phenotypic features and fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) analysis suggested that these isolates are members of E. cancerogenus or E. asburiae or a closely related species. Biochemical data revealed that the isolates could be differentiated from their nearest neighbours by the presence of lysine decarboxylase activity and their ability to utilize d-arabitol. DNA-DNA relatedness also distinguished the two isolates from phylogenetically closely related Enterobacter strains. Based on these data, it is proposed that the isolates represent a novel species of the genus Enterobacter, named Enterobacter mori sp. nov. The type strain is R18-2(T) ( = CGMCC 1.10322(T) = LMG 25706(T)).
TI  - Concomitant rock phosphate dissolution and lead immobilization by phosphate solubilizing bacteria (Enterobacter sp.).
AB  - This paper examines the potential value of phosphate solubilizing bacteria (Enterobacter cloacae) in the dissolution of rock phosphate (RP) and subsequent immobilization of lead (Pb) in both bacterial growth medium and soils. Enterobacter sp. showed resistance to Pb and the bacterium solubilized 17.5% of RP in the growth medium. Enterobacter sp. did not enhance Pb immobilization in solution because of acidification of bacterial medium, thereby inhibiting the formation of P-induced Pb precipitation. However, in the case of soil, Enterobacter sp. increased Pb immobilization by 6.98, 25.6 and 32.0% with the RP level of 200, 800 and 1600 mg P/kg, respectively. The immobilization of Pb in Pb-spiked soils was attributed to pyromorphite formation as indicated by XRD analysis. Inoculation of phosphate solubilizing bacteria with RP in soil can be used as an alternative technique to soluble P compounds which can cause eutrophication of surface water.
TI  - Prevalence of multidrug-resistant bacteria at a tertiary-care teaching hospital in Mexico: special focus on Acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  - Our aim was to determine the prevalence of multidrug resistance of Acinetobacter  baumannii and other pathogens at a tertiary-care teaching hospital in Mexico over a 3-year period. Clinical isolates of A. baumannii (n = 550), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 250), some Enterobacteriaceae species (n = 500) and Staphylococcus aureus (n = 250) collected over a 3-year period were included. Susceptibility tests were performed by the broth microdilution method. 74% of A. baumannii, 40% of Escherichia coli, 34% of P. aeruginosa, 22% of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 9% of Enterobacter cloacae, and 7% of Serratia sp. were multidrug resistant. 59% of A. baumannii clinical isolates were meropenem-resistant. A. baumannii isolates from the lower respiratory tract were the most susceptible, followed by urine clinical isolates. Species from Enterobacteriaceae showed susceptibility rates higher than 90% to meropenem and tigecycline and Serratia sp. showed the highest susceptibility to the drugs evaluated. For P. aeruginosa, the most potent drug was levofloxacin, followed by meropenem and piperacillin-tazobactam. With regard to S. aureus, 96% of the isolates were susceptible to vancomycin, followed by tigecycline and minocycline (91% of strains susceptible). The high multidrug resistance observed underscores the need for surveillance of bacterial drug resistance.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of plant growth promoting bacteria from non-rhizospheric soil and their effect on cowpea (Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.) seedling growth.
AB  - The efficacy of four potential phosphate solubilizing Enterobacter isolated from  non-rhizospheric soil in Western ghat forest in India. Plant growth promoting ability of these isolates was evaluated in cowpea. All are gram negative, rod shaped, 0.8-1.6 mm in size, and psychrotrophic in nature, grow from 5 to 40 degrees C (optimum temp. 28 +/- 2 degrees C). All isolates exhibits growth at a wide range of pH 6-12, optimum at pH 7.0 and tolerates up to 7% (w/v) salt concentration. 16S rRNA gene sequencing reveals the confirmation of isolates to Enterobacter aerogenes sp. (NII-0907 and NII-0929), Enterobacter cloacae subsp. cloacae sp. (NII-0931) and Enterobacter asburiae sp. (NII-0934) with which they share >99% sequence similarity. Under in vitro conditions, all the four isolates were found to produce indole acetic acid, P-solubilization and hydrogen cyanide. The P-solubilizing activity coincided with a concomitant decrease in pH of the medium (pH 7.0-<3.0). The plant growth promotion properties were demonstrated through a cow pea (Vigna unguiculata (L.) walp) based bioassay under greenhouse conditions. Although the bacterial inoculation was found to result in significant increment in root, shoot and biomass and it stimulated bacterial counts in the rhizosphere. Hence, these isolates can further formulated and used for field application.
TI  - Comparison of the efficacy of Rose Bengal and erythrosin in photodynamic therapy  against Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of the photosensitizers Rose Bengal and erythrosin combined with a light-emitting diode (LED) on Enterobacteriaceae. Twelve Enterobacteriaceae strains isolated from the oral cavities of patients undergoing prolonged antibiotic therapy, including three Escherichia coli, three Enterobacter cloacae, three Klebsiella oxytoca and three Klebsiella pneumoniae, were studied. An Enterobacteriaceae suspension (10(6) cells/ml) was prepared from each clinical strain isolated from the human oral cavity and subjected to the following treatments: LED and Rose Bengal, LED and erythrosin, LED and physiological solution, and physiological solution only as control. A blue LED unit (460 nm), and Rose Bengal and erythrosin at a concentration of 50 micromol/l were used. After incubation at 37 degrees C for 48 h, the number of colony-forming units (CFU) was calculated and subjected to analysis of variance (ANOVA). The Enterobacterial strains were sensitive to photodynamic therapy with Rose Bengal. There was a reduction of approximately 7.14 log10 for Enterobacter cloacae, 7.73 log10 for Escherichia coli, 6.76 log10 for Klebsiella pneumoniae and 7.21 log10 for Klebsiella oxytoca. However, photodynamic therapy using erythrosin did not reduce the numbers of CFUs per milliliter compared to the control group. The use of the LED alone had no toxic effect on the strain tested. The Enterobacteriaceae strains studied were sensitive to photodynamic therapy with Rose Bengal.
TI  - Molybdate reduction by Pseudomonas sp. strain DRY2.
AB  - AIMS: To isolate and characterize a potent molybdenum-reducing bacterium. METHODS AND RESULTS: A minimal salt medium supplemented with 10 mmol l(-1) molybdate, glucose (1.0%, w/v) as a carbon source and ammonium sulfate (0.3%, w/v) as a nitrogen source was used in the screening process. A molybdenum-reducing bacterium was isolated and tentatively identified as Pseudomonas sp. strain DRY2 based on carbon utilization profiles using Biolog GN plates and partial 16S rDNA molecular phylogeny. Strain DRY2 produced 2.4, 3.2 and 6.2 times more molybdenum blue compared to Serratia marcescens strain DRY6, Enterobacter cloacae strain 48 and Eschericia coli K12, respectively. Molybdate reduction was optimum at 5 mmol l(-1) phosphate. The optimum molybdate concentration that supported molybdate reduction at 5 mmol l(-1) phosphate was between 15 and 25 mmol l(-1). Molybdate reduction was optimum at 40 degrees C and at pH 6.0. Phosphate concentrations higher than 5 mmol l(-1) strongly inhibited molybdate reduction. Inhibitors of electron transport system such as antimycin A, rotenone, sodium azide and cyanide did not inhibit the molybdenum-reducing enzyme activity. Chromium, copper, mercury and lead inhibited the molybdenum-reducing activity. CONCLUSIONS: A novel molybdenum-reducing bacterium with high molybdenum reduction capacity has been isolated. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Molybdenum is an emerging global pollutant that is very toxic to ruminants. The characteristics of this bacterium suggest that it would be useful in the bioremediation of molybdenum pollutant.
TI  - Enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonadaceae on the dorsum of the human tongue.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to correlate the presence of Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonadaceae, Moraxellaceae and Xanthomonadaceae on the posterior dorsum of the human tongue with the presence of tongue coating, gender, age, smoking habit and denture use. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Bacteria were isolated from the posterior tongue dorsum of 100 individuals in MacConkey agar medium and were identified by the API 20E system (Biolab-Merieux). RESULTS: 43% of the individuals, presented the target microorganisms on the tongue dorsum, with greater prevalence among individuals between 40 and 50 years of age (p = 0.001) and non-smokers (p=0.0485). CONCLUSIONS: A higher prevalence of Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonadaceae was observed on the tongue dorsum of the individuals evaluated. There was no correlation between these species and the presence and thickness of tongue coating, gender and presence of dentures.
TI  - Novel insights about class 2 integrons from experimental and genomic epidemiology.
AB  - In order to contribute to the knowledge of the architecture and epidemiology of class 2 integrons, we performed a class 2 integron molecular survey in which we analyzed 726 isolates in two bacterial populations from environmental and nonepidemiologically related clinical samples, respectively, collected from 1982 to 2007. We recovered the intI2 gene from 130 of 726 isolates, most of which were clinical isolates, and only 1 (a psychrophilic Pseudomonas sp.) was from a water sample. Unlike the widespread distribution of class 1 integrons within Gram-negative bacilli, only Acinetobacter baumannii and Enterobacter cloacae harbored class 2 integrons at a high frequency in our collection. Class 2 integrons with six novel cassette arrays were documented. Characterization of the transposition module of Tn7, the genetic platform in which class 2 integrons have always been reported, showed tns modules with a mosaic genetic structure. A bioinformatic analysis performed with the tns genes present in sequence databases, the finding of intI2 not associated with tns genes, and the genetic examination of novel tns-like genes found in three isolates indicated the possibility of the independent evolution of the two components related to horizontal gene transfer, the class 2 integrons and the Tn7 transposons.
TI  - The in-vitro antimicrobial activity of some medicinal plants against beta-lactam-resistant bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In effort to identify novel bacterial agents, this study was initiated to evaluate the antimicrobial properties of 17 crude extracts from 12 medicinal plants against beta-lactam-resistant bacteria. METHODOLOGY: The antimicrobial activities of plant extracts were evaluated against clinically proved beta-lactam-resistant bacteria (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus sp.) and reference strains of bacteria (Escherichia coli ATCC 35218, Enterobacter aerogenes ATCC 29751, E. aerogenes ATCC 13048, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 and Enterococcus hirae ATCC 9790) by using disc-diffusion and agar-dilution assays. RESULTS: The crude plant extracts demonstrated broad spectrum activity against all bacteria tested with inhibition zones in the range of 8-30 mm. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of different plant extracts against the tested bacteria were found to range from <or= 0.3 to >or= 10 mg ml(-1). The most active plant extracts were from Dortenia picta and Bridelia micrantha (MIC: 1.25-10 mg ml(-1)) on beta-lactam-resistant Gram-negative bacilli and the extracts from B. micrantha, Mallotus oppositifolius, Garcinia lucida, Garcinia. kola, Campylospermum densiflorum (leaves) and C. zenkeri (root) on beta-lactam-resistant Gram-positive cocci (MIC: <or= 0.3-5 mg ml(-1)). CONCLUSION: Of the 17 plant extracts studied, seven showed good antimicrobial activity against the tested bacteria. The stem bark of B. micrantha and the leaves of D. picta were most active towards beta-lactamase producing Gram-negative bacilli. This study shows that medicinal plants could be sources of compounds which can be used to fight against beta-lactam resistant bacteria.
TI  - Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases among Enterobacteriaceae isolated in a public hospital in Brazil.
AB  - Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) in enterobacteria are recognized worldwide as a great hospital problem. In this study, 127 ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae isolated in one year from inpatients and outpatients at a public teaching hospital at Sao Paulo, Brazil, were submitted to analysis by PCR with specific primers for bla SHV, bla TEM and bla CTX-M genes. From the 127 isolates, 96 (75.6%) Klebsiella pneumoniae, 12 (9.3%) Escherichia coli, 8 (6.2%) Morganella morganii, 3 (2.3%) Proteus mirabilis, 2 (1.6%) Klebsiella oxytoca, 2 (1.6%) Providencia rettgeri, 2 (1.6%) Providencia stuartti, 1 (0.8%) Enterobacter aerogenes and 1 (0.8%) Enterobacter cloacae were identified as ESBL producers. Bla SHV, bla TEM and bla CTX-M were detected in 63%, 17.3% and 33.9% strains, respectively. Pulsed field gel eletrophoresis genotyping of K. pneumoniae revealed four main molecular patterns and 29 unrelated profiles. PCR results showed a high variety of ESBL groups among strains, in nine different species. The results suggest the spread of resistance genes among genetically different strains of ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae in some hospital wards, and also that some strongly related strains were identified in different hospital wards, suggesting clonal spread in the institutional environment.
TI  - Emergence of Klebsiella pneumoniae carrying the novel extended-spectrum beta-lactamase gene variants bla(SHV-40), bla(TEM-116) and the class 1 integron-associated bla(GES-7) in Brazil.
AB  - A clinical Klebsiella pneumoniae isolate carrying the extended-spectrum beta-lactamase gene variants bla(SHV-40), bla(TEM-116) and bla(GES-7) was recovered. Cefoxitin and ceftazidime activity was most affected by the presence of these genes and an additional resistance to trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole was observed. The bla(GES-7) gene was found to be inserted into a class 1 integron. These results show the emergence of novel bla(TEM) and bla(SHV) genes in Brazil. Moreover, the presence of class 1 integrons suggests a great potential for dissemination of bla(GES) genes into diverse nosocomial pathogens. Indeed, the bla(GES-7) gene was originally discovered in Enterobacter cloacae in Greece and, to our knowledge, has not been reported elsewhere.
TI  - Mangrovibacter plantisponsor gen. nov., sp. nov., a nitrogen-fixing bacterium isolated from a mangrove-associated wild rice (Porteresia coarctata Tateoka).
AB  - A facultatively anaerobic, nitrogen-fixing bacterium, strain MSSRF40(T), was isolated from roots of mangrove-associated wild rice (Porteresia coarctata Tateoka). On the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities, strain MSSRF40(T) was shown to belong to the family Enterobacteriaceae, most closely related to Cronobacter muytjensii E603(T) (97.2 % sequence similarity), Enterobacter cloacae subsp. dissolvens LMG 2683(T) (97.1 %), E. radicincitans D5/23(T) (97.1 %) and E. ludwigii EN-119(T) (97.0 %). Sequence analysis of rpoB, gyrB and hsp60 genes showed that strain MSSRF40(T) had relatively low sequence similarity (<91, <84 and <90 %) to recognized species of different genera of the family Enterobacteriaceae and formed an independent phyletic lineage in all phylogenetic analyses using the 16S rRNA, rpoB, gyrB and hsp60 genes, clearly indicating that strain MSSRF40(T) could not be affiliated to any of the recognized genera within the family Enterobacteriaceae. The dominant cellular fatty acids were C(16 : 0), C(16 : 1)omega7c and/or iso-C(15 : 0) 2-OH and C(18 : 1)omega7c, similar to those of other members of the Enterobacteriaceae. The DNA G+C content was 50.1 mol%. Phylogenetic distinctiveness and phenotypic differences from its phylogenetic neighbours indicated that strain MSSRF40(T) represents a novel species and genus within the family Enterobacteriaceae, for which the name Mangrovibacter plantisponsor gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain of Mangrovibacter plantisponsor is strain MSSRF40(T) (=LMG 24236(T) =DSM 19579(T)).
TI  - Enhancing biodegradation of wastewater by microbial consortia with fractional factorial design.
AB  - Batch experiments were conducted on the degradation of synthetic and municipal wastewater by six different strains, i.e., Agrobacterium sp., Bacillus sp., Enterobacter cloacae, Gordonia, Pseudomonas stutzeri, Pseudomonas putida. By applying a fractional factorial design (FFD) of experiments, the influence of each strain and their interactions were quantified. An empirical model predicting the treatment efficiency was built based on the results of the FFD experiments with an R(2) value of 99.39%. For single strain, Enterobacter cloacae, Gordonia and P. putida (p=0.008, 0.009 and 0.023, respectively) showed significant enhancement on organic removal in the synthetic wastewater. Positive interaction from Enterobacter cloacae, Gordonia (p=0.046) was found, indicating that syntrophic interaction existed, and their coexistence can improve total organic carbon (TOC) degradation. Verification experiments were performed to evaluate the effect of bioaugmentation by introducing three selected strains into an activated sludge reactor for treating municipal wastewater. The removal efficiency of TOC with the bioaugmentation was increased from 67-72% to 80-84% at an influent TOC concentration of 200mg/L. The results derived from this study indicate that the FFD is a useful screening tool for optimizing the microbial community to enhance treatment efficiency.
TI  - Enterobacter oryzae sp. nov., a nitrogen-fixing bacterium isolated from the wild  rice species Oryza latifolia.
AB  - Twelve facultatively anaerobic, endophytic diazotrophs were isolated from surface-sterilized roots of the wild rice species Oryza latifolia and characterized by phenotypic and molecular methods. Six isolates were grouped together as group A by phenotypic characters, and this grouping was confirmed by SDS-PAGE whole-cell protein patterns and insertion sequence-based PCR (IS-PCR) methods. Phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence indicated that group A, represented by strain Ola 51(T), is closely related to Enterobacter radicincitans D5/23(T) (98.9 % similarity, except that E. radicincitans D5/23(T) has a 70 bp insertion) and Enterobacter cloacae (98.0 % similarity to the type strain). rpoB gene sequence analysis also showed strain Ola 51(T) has the highest sequence similarity to E. radicincitans DSM 16656(T) (98.3 %), but supported the distinct position. Biological and biochemical tests, protein patterns, genomic DNA fingerprinting, antibiotic resistance and comparison of cellular fatty acids showed differences among group A, E. radicincitans DSM 16656(T) and E. cloacae ATCC 13047(T). DNA-DNA hybridization distinguished strain Ola 51(T) from closely phylogenetically related Enterobacter species. Based on these data, the novel species Enterobacter oryzae sp. nov. is proposed, with strain Ola 51(T) (=LMG 24251(T) =CGMCC 1.7012(T)) as the type strain.
TI  - Identification of hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine-degrading microorganisms via 15N-stable isotope probing.
AB  - This study reported the application of 15N-stable isotope probing (SIP) to identify active hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX)-utilizing microorganisms in groundwater microcosms. Fifteen 16S rRNA gene sequences were derived from the 15N-DNA fraction (contributed from active microorganisms capable of using RDX as a nitrogen source) of microcosms receiving cheese whey. The 16S rRNA gene sequences belonged to Actinobacteria (two clones), alpha-Proteobacteria (seven clones), and gamma-Proteobacteria (six clones). Except for five sequences with high similarity to two known RDX degraders (Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas fluorescens I-C), our results suggested that phylogenetically diverse microorganisms were capable of using RDX as a nitrogen source. Six sequences of the xplA gene (a known RDX-degrading catabolic gene) were detected from the 15N-DNA fraction. The xplA gene sequences were 96-99% similar to the xplA gene of Rhodococcus sp. DN22(a known RDX utilizer), suggesting that other RDX utilizers might contain xplA-like genes. Twenty-five 16S rRNA gene sequences recovered from the unenriched, RDX-contaminated groundwater clustered differently from those obtained from the 15N-DNA fraction of the cheese-whey-amended microcosm. Our results suggested that active RDX utilizers can be stimulated by nutrient source additions even if they are present at low densities, and that use of 15N-SIP can identifythese functional members of the microbial community.
TI  - Changes in bacterial isolates from burn wounds and their antibiograms: a 20-year  study (1986-2005).
AB  - BACKGROUND: Our aim is to elucidate shifts in the bacterial spectrum colonising burn wounds and corresponding antibiotic susceptibilities during a 20-year study period. METHODS: Microbiological results from burn patients collected between 1986 and 2005 were analysed retrospectively. RESULTS: Staphylococcus aureus was isolated most frequently (20.8%), followed by Escherichia coli (13.9%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (11.8%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) (10.9%), Enterococcus sp. (9.7%), Enterobacter cloacae (5.6%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (5%), Acinetobacter sp. (3.2%), Proteus mirabilis (2%) and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (1.4%). Susceptibility of S. aureus to broad-spectrum substances such as ciprofloxacin or penicillinase-stable penicillins has waned, others such as cotrimoxazole or netilmicin remained effective. Not a single resistance against vancomycin was recorded. Increases in methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) were pronounced (3% in 1986-1997 (the first of the three study periods) to 16% in 1998-2001 and 13% in 2002-2005). Results for methicillin-resistant CNS (MRCNS) show an even greater increase. P. aeruginosa has shown increasing susceptibility against netilmicin (1986-1989: 84%, 2002-2005: 95%). Susceptibility of P. aeruginosa to ceftazidime has decreased markedly. S. maltophilia has shown clinically relevant susceptibility mainly against ciprofloxacin. Acinetobacter sp. have shown little susceptibility to most antibiotics. Imipenem or meropenem have been very reliable reserve antibiotics throughout the study period for the fermenting Enterobacteriaceae (E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae and P. mirabilis), with susceptibilities of or near 100%. CONCLUSION: In-depth knowledge of the bacteria causing infectious complications and of their antibiotic susceptibilities is a prerequisite for treating burn patients. Our study shows shifts in the microbial spectrum and their antibiogram, which mandate frequent reassessments.
TI  - Nitrous oxide emission and microbial community in the rhizosphere of nodulated soybeans during the late growth period.
AB  - We examined N(2)O emissions from the rhizosphere of field-grown soybeans during the late growth stage (99-117 days after sowing). Marked emissions were detected from the nodulated root systems of field-grown soybeans, whereas a non-nodulating soybean mutant showed no emission. Degraded nodules exclusively generated the N(2)O. A culture-independent analysis of microbial communities showed Bradyrhizobium sp., Acidvorax facilis, Salmonella enterica, Xanthomonas sp., Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas putida, Fusarium sp., nematodes, and other protozoans to be more abundant in the degraded nodules, suggesting that some of these organisms participate in the N(2)O emission process in the soybean rhizosphere.
TI  - Role of a moderately halophilic bacterial consortium in the biodegradation of polyaromatic hydrocarbons.
AB  - Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are ubiquitous pollutants in the environment, and most high molecular weight PAHs cause mutagenic, teratogenic and potentially carcinogenic effects. While several strains have been identified that degrade PAHs, the present study is focused on the degradation of PAHs in a marine environment by a moderately halophilic bacterial consortium. The bacterial consortium was isolated from a mixture of marine water samples collected from seven different sites in Chennai, India. The low molecular weight (LMW) PAHs phenanthrene and fluorine, and the high molecular weight (HMW) PAHs pyrene and benzo(e)pyrene were selected for the degradation study. The consortium metabolized both LMW and HMW PAHs. The consortium was also able to degrade PAHs present in crude oil-contaminated saline wastewater. The bacterial consortium was able to degrade 80% of HMW PAHs and 100% of LMW PAHs in the saline wastewater. The strains present in the consortium were identified as Ochrobactrum sp., Enterobacter cloacae and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. This study reveals that these bacteria have the potential to degrade different PAHs in saline wastewater.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of lactic acid bacteria community SFC-2 used for fermentation of air-dried crop straws].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the antibacterial activity of lactic acid bacteria community SFC-2 in fermented crop straw. METHODS: Total 13 isolates were obtained from spontaneous fermented rice straw by plating, paper diffusion and Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis. All these strains were used to determine the antibacterial activity of SFC-2. RESULTS: (1) Phylogenetic analysis of the 13 strains based on 16S rDNA gene sequence data indicated that 9 strains belong to Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Bacillus cereus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacterfreundii, Klebsiella terrigena and Citrobacter sp., which were all common pathogens or opportunistic pathogens. (2) Indicating bacteria selected from the pathogens were used to detect antibacterial activity of SFC-2 cell-free culture supernatant. The results showed that: SFC-2 community had stronger antibacterial activity than isolated strains from SFC-2 community or man-made communities against indicating bacteria. (3) Antibacterial activities of seven different cell-free culture supernatants, which were extracted at intervals from the culture of SFC-2 community during 14-48 hours, were no obvious difference, but the content of organic acids were obvious differences during 14-48 hours; the antibacterial substances were stable after heating and sensitive partly to protease K.
TI  - Growth, encystment and survival of Acanthamoeba castellanii grazing on different  bacteria.
AB  - Free-living amoebae of the genus Acanthamoeba are widely distributed in soil and  water collections, where trophozoites (vegetative, multiplicative stages) feed mainly by phagocytosis and thus control bacterial populations in the environment. Here, we examined the growth, encystment and survival of Acanthamoeba castellanii receiving different bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus megaterium, Micrococcus luteus, and Staphylococcus aureus) in nonnutrient saline. All bacteria assayed induced a dose-dependent proliferative response, in most cases maximized with a bacterial dose of 1 x 10(9) mL(-1); except for M. luteus, trophozoites grew better with viable than with heat-killed bacteria. In addition, Acanthamoeba growth was improved by adding bacteria on alternate days. Single-dose experiments indicated a temporal association between the growth of trophozoite and bacterial consumption, and higher consumption of M. luteus, E. coli and P. aeruginosa, bacterial species that allowed the highest trophozoite yields. Long-term Acanthamoeba-bacteria incubation revealed that encystment was significantly delayed by almost all the bacteria assayed (including S. aureus, which elicited a poor growth response) and that the presence of bacteria markedly increased cyst yield; final cyst recovery clearly depended on both the dose and the type of the bacterium given, being much higher with E. coli, M. luteus and P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of ACC deaminase gene from two plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria.
AB  - Lowering of plant ethylene by deamination of its immediate precursor 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) is a key trait found in many rhizobacteria. We isolated and screened bacteria from the rhizosphere of wheat for their ACC-degrading ability. The ACC deaminase gene (acdS) isolated from two bacterial isolates through PCR amplification was cloned and sequenced. Nucleotide sequence alignment of these genes with previously reported genes of Pseudomonas sp. strain ACP and Enterobacter cloacae strain UW4 showed variation in their sequences. In the phylogenetic analysis, distinctness of these two genes was observed as a separate cluster. 16S rDNA sequencing of two isolates identified them to be Achromobacter sp. and Pseudomonas stutzeri.
TI  - Enterobacter cloacae SLD1a-1 gains a selective advantage from selenate reduction  when growing in nitrate-depleted anaerobic environments.
AB  - Enterobacter cloacae SLD1a-1 is capable of the complete reduction of selenate to  selenium and the initial reaction is catalysed by a membrane-bound selenate reductase. In the present study, continuous culture experiments were employed to investigate the possibility that selenate reduction, via the selenate reductase, might provide sufficient energy to maintain cell viability when deprived of the preferred anaerobic terminal electron acceptor nitrate. The evidence presented indicates that the selenate reductase supports slow growth that retards the wash-out of the culture when switching to nitrate-depleted selenate-rich medium, and provides a proton motive force for sustained cell maintenance. In contrast, a strain of E. cloacae (sub sp. cloacae) that does not readily reduce selenate, cannot sustain cell maintenance when switching to a selenate-rich medium. This work demonstrates for the first time that respiratory linked selenate reduction gives E. cloacae SLD1a-1 a selective advantage when inhabiting selenate-contaminated environments and highlights the suitability of utilising E. cloacae SLD1a-1 when developing selenium remediation strategies.
TI  - Occurrence of yeasts, enterococci and other enteric bacteria in subgingival biofilm of HIV-positive patients with chronic gingivitis and necrotizing periodontitis.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of enteric bacteria and yeasts in biofilm of 80 HIV-positive patients with plaque-associated gingivitis or necrotizing periodontitis. Patients were subjected to extra, intra oral and radiographic examinations. The oral hygiene, bleeding on probing, gingival conditions, and attachment loss were evaluated. Clinical specimens were collected from gingival crevices or periodontal pockets, transferred to VMGA III, diluted and transferred to Sabouraud Dextrose agar with 100 mug/ml of chloramphenicol, peptone water, EVA broth, EMB agar, SS agar, Bile esculin agar and Brilliant green agar. Isolation of yeasts was carried out at room temperature, for 3-7 days; and for the isolation of enteric microorganisms plates were incubated at 37 degrees C, for 24-48 h. The yeasts identification was performed according to the carbon and nitrogen assimilation, fermentation of carbohydrates and germ tube formation. Bacteria were identified according to their colonial and cellular morphologies and biochemical tests. Yeasts were identified as Candida albicans and its occurrence was more common in patients with CD4+ below 200/mm(3) and was affected by the extension of periodontal involvement (P = 0.0345). Enteric bacteria recovered from clinical specimens were identified as Enterobacter sakazakii, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia liquefaciens, Klebsiella oxytoca and Enterococcus sp. Enterobacteriaceae and enterococci were detected in 32.5% of clinical samples from patients with necrotizing periodontitis. In conclusion, non-oral pathogenic bacteria and C. albicans were more prevalent in periodontal sites of HIV-positive patients with necrotizing periodontitis and chronic gingivitis.
TI  - Screening, cloning, expression, and purification of an acidic arylmalonate decarboxylase from Enterobacter cloacae KU1313.
AB  - We have already isolated, purified, and characterized arylmalonate decarboxylases (AMDase; EC. 4.1.1.76) from Alcaligenes bronchisepticus KU1201 and Achromobacter sp. KU1311. These are unique enzymes that give optically pure alpha-arylpropionates from the corresponding alpha-aryl-alpha-methylmalonates. Recently, we have further screened novel AMDase producers from soil samples under acidic conditions and succeeded in isolating Enterobacter cloacae KU1313. The gene encoding the enzyme was cloned by polymerase chain reaction and sequenced. The AMDase gene consists of 720 nucleotides, which specifies a 240-amino-acid protein. The recombinant enzyme was purified and shown that the pH-activity profiles were quite different from those of known AMDases.
TI  - Carbohydrate and ethane release with Erwinia carotovora subspecies betavasculorum--induced necrosis.
AB  - Erwinia carotovora subspecies betavasculorum, also known as E. betavasculorum and Pectobacterium betavasculorum, is a soil bacterium that has the capacity to cause root rot necrosis of sugarbeets. The qualitatively different pathogenicity exhibited by the virulent E. carotovora strain and two avirulent strains, a Citrobacter sp. and an Enterobacter cloacae, was examined using digital analysis of photographic evidence of necrosis as well as for carbohydrate, ethane, and ethylene release compared with uninoculated potato tuber slices. Visual scoring of necrosis was superior to digital analysis of photographs. The release of carbohydrates and ethane from potato tuber slices inoculated with the soft rot necrosis-causing Erwinia was significantly greater than that of potato tuber slices that had not been inoculated or that had been inoculated with the nonpathogenic E. cloacae and Citrobacter sp. strains. Interestingly, ethylene production from potato slices left uninoculated or inoculated with the nonpathogenic Citrobacter strain was 5- to 10-fold higher than with potato slices inoculated with the pathogenic Erwinia strain. These findings suggest that (1) carbohydrate release might be a useful measure of the degree of pathogenesis, or relative virulence; and that (2) bacterial suppression of ethylene formation may be a critical step in root rot disease formation.
TI  - Biochemical reference intervals and intestinal microflora of free-ranging Ricord's iguanas (Cyclura ricordii).
AB  - Caribbean iguanas, including the Ricord's iguana (Cyclura ricordii) are ranked as critically endangered on the International Union of the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List. The taxon is endemic to Hispaniola, where it inhabits xeric lowlands and is found in a very limited range in two subpopulations in the southwestern area of the island. The goals of this study were to obtain and analyze plasma biochemical and intestinal microbiological data from Ricord's iguanas in the subpopulation of the Neiba Valley, on Cabritos Island National Park, Dominican Republic, and to establish biochemical reference intervals. A total of 23 blood samples from clinically healthy iguanas (16 males, 7 females) and 14 fecal samples from clinically healthy iguanas were analyzed. Adult female iguanas had higher concentrations of cholesterol, phosphorus, triglycerides, urea, uric acid, and aspartate transaminase activity compared with male iguanas, although the difference was not statistically significant. Seventeen bacterial isolates were obtained, including: Salmonella sp. (serogroup B; serogroup D negative) Escherichia coli, Brevibacterium sp., Enterobacter cloacae, and Enterococcus durans. These data will help contribute to the management and recovery of Ricord's iguana populations.
TI  - Diversity of microflora in the gut and casts of tropical composting earthworms reared on different substrates.
AB  - The diversity of fungi, bacteria, yeast, actinomycetes and protozoa were analysed in the gut and casts of Eudrilus eugeniae, Lampito mauritii, Eisenia fetida and Perionyx excavatus, both qualitatively and quantitatively as influenced by different feed substrates like clay loam soil, cowdung and pressmud. While actinomycetes (Streptomyces albus, S. somaliensis, Nocardia asteroides, N. caviae and Saccharomonosporia) were not digested by any of these species of worms, protozoa (Amoeba proteus, A. terricola, Paramecium trichium, Euglena viridis, E. orientalis, Vorticella picta and Trichomonas hominis) and yeast (Candida tropicalis, C. krusei C. albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans) were totally digested. Certain species of fungi (Saksenae vasiformis, Mucor plumbeus, Cladosporium carrionii, C. herbacium, Alternaria sp., Cunninghamella echinulata, Mycetia sterila, Syncephalostrum racemosum, Curvalaria lunata, C. geniculata and Geotrichum candidum) and bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacterium antitratum, Mima polymorpha, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. cloacae, Proteus vulgaris, P. mirabilis, P. rettgeri, Escherichia coli, Staphylococus citreus, Bacillus subtilis, B. cereus, Enterococci and Micrococci) were completely digested. Certain other species were not digested fungi like Aspergillus fumigatus, A. flavus, A. ochraceous, Trichoderma koningii (except by Eeugeniae), Fusarium moniliforme (except by E. eugeniae) and Rhizopus sp., and bacteria like Klebsiella pneumoniae and Morganella morganii) and these were multiplied during the transit of the organic residues through the gut of worms. The microbial proliferation was more in the casts, due to the environment prevailing--rich in nutrient supply and large surface area available for growth and reproduction of the microbes that lead to enhanced microbial activity and humic acid contents in the casts.
TI  - Association of bacteria with metacercarial cysts of Echinostoma caproni.
AB  - Echinostoma caproni metacercarial cysts often need to be stored for several months to a year to meet laboratory requirements. This study examined the bacteria associated with encysted metacercariae stored at 4 degrees C. Bacterial assemblages from the kidney-pericardial region of uninfected snails and assemblages from the site of metacercarial infection in Biomphalaria glabrata were determined. Four species of Gram-negative rods were isolated and identified from the stored cysts to species or genus as Pseudomonas sp., Alcaligenes sp., Enterobacter cloacae, and Aeromonas hydrophila. Gram-positive rods were also isolated and included small slender rods (alpha hemolytic), small coccobacilli (gamma hemolytic), and small rods that exhibited gamma hemolysis. Accumulation of these bacteria on the surface of encysted metacercariae probably contributed to a decreased cyst viability of E. caproni.
TI  - Predictors of in-hospital mortality for bloodstream infections caused by Enterobacter species or Citrobacter freundii.
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To identify predictors of in-hospital mortality among patients with bacteremia caused by Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, or Citrobacter freundii. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: 1300-bed tertiary academic medical center. PATIENTS: One hundred twenty-four patients who had bloodstream infections caused by E. cloacae (3), E. aerogenes (71), or C. freundii (50) between 1998 and 2004. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Data from patients with bloodstream infections caused by Enterobacter sp or C. freundii were retrospectively segregated according to hospital survival (98 survivors, 26 nonsurvivors). Multiple patient characteristics and processes of care were evaluated to identify factors contributing to in-hospital mortality. Multiple logistic regression was performed based on univariate comparisons to determine independent risk factors for in-hospital mortality. Among the 124 cases of bacteremia, the crude in-hospital mortality rate was 21% (26 cases). Univariate analysis revealed that survivors were more likely to receive an aminoglycoside as part of their empiric antimicrobial regimen (40% [39/98]) compared with nonsurvivors (19% [5/26], p=0.05). Other factors related to antimicrobial therapy including choice and number of agents used did not differ between survivors and nonsurvivors (p>0.05). Vasopressor use (31% [30/98] vs 62% [16/26]), care in an intensive care unit (19% [19/98] vs 54% [14/26]), and acute renal failure (13% [13/98] vs 31% [8/26]) occurred more frequently in nonsurvivors (p<0.05). Multiple logistic regression identified resistance to second- or third-generation cephalosporins (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 5.16, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.66-10.0, p=0.013), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole resistance (adjusted OR 5.44, 95% CI 2.53-11.7, p=0.027), and mechanical ventilation (adjusted OR 12.2, 95% CI 5.99-24.5, p<0.001) as independent determinants of mortality. CONCLUSION: Among patients with Enterobacter sp or C. freundii bloodstream infections, those with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-resistant or second or third-generation cephalosporin-resistant strains or those who required mechanical ventilation had an increased risk of mortality.
TI  - Screening for anti-infective properties of several medicinal plants of the Mauritians flora.
AB  - Several plants of the Mauritian flora alleged to possess anti-infective properties were studied against different strains of pathogenic bacteria and fungi. The grounded dried plant materials were extracted with different extractants and screened for anti-microbial activity using the disk diffusion and the micro-dilution techniques. Preliminary screening revealed that the methanol extracts were most active. Salmonella enteritidis, Enterobacter cloacae and Bacillus subtilis were the three test organisms, which were found to be susceptible to all the crude methanolic extracts of the different plants investigated (100% susceptibility), followed by Escherichia coli (57.1%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (57.1%), and Staphylococcus aureus (28.6%). The lowest minimum inhibitory concentration recorded for the different crude methanol extracts against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enteritidis, Enterobacter cloacae, Bacillus subtilis and the mould fungus Candida albicans were 500, 1000, 125, 250, 1000 and 125 micro g/ml, respectively. Bioautography using Cladosporium cucumerinum revealed that dichloromethane (DCM) extracts had the highest activity against the phytopathogenic fungus. It was also noted that the DCM extracts of Michelia champaca and Antidesma madagascariense yielded the maximum number of growth inhibiting compounds against Cladosporium cucumerinum. Activity of the different crude extracts was also investigated against several phytopathogenic filamentous fungi, Colletotrichum glocosporoides, Rhizoctonia solani, Sclerotinia sclerotium, Guignardia sp. and Fusarium oxysporum. It was found that crude hexane extracts as well as crude DCM extracts exhibited marked activity against several strains of fungi, especially Colletotrichum glocosporoides, Sclerotinia sclerotium and Guignardia sp.
TI  - Plantago lanceolata and Plantago rugelii Extracts are Toxic to Meloidogyne incognita but not to Certain Microbes.
AB  - Extracts from the plants Plantago lanceolata and P. rugelii were evaluated for toxicity to the root-knot nematode Meloidogyne incognita, the beneficial microbes Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas fluorescens and Trichoderma virens, and the plant-pathogenic fungi Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. gladioli, Phytophthora capsici, Pythium ultimum, and Rhizoctonia solani. Wild plants were collected, roots were excised from shoots, and the plant parts were dried and ground to a powder. One set of extracts (10% w/v) was prepared in water and another in methanol. Treatments included extract concentrations of 25%, 50%, 75% and 100%, and water controls. Meloidogyne incognita egg hatch was recorded after 7-day exposure to the treatments, and second-stage juvenile (J2) activity after 48 hours. All extracts were toxic to eggs and J2, with P. lanceolata shoot extract tending to have the most activity against M. incognita. Numbers of active J2 remained the same or decreased in a 24-hour water rinse following the 48-hour extract treatment, indicating that the extracts were lethal. When data from water- and methanol-extracted roots and shoots of both plant species were combined for analysis, J2 tended to be more sensitive than eggs to the toxic compounds at lower concentrations, while the higher concentrations (75% and 100%) were equally toxic to both life stages. The effective concentrations causing 50% reduction (EC(50)) in egg hatch and in J2 viability were 44.4% and 43.7%, respectively. No extract was toxic to any of the bacteria or fungi in our assays.
TI  - Effect of carbon substrates on rock phosphate solubilization by bacteria from composts and macrofauna.
AB  - Five of the 207 isolates from different composts, farm waste compost (FWC), rice  straw compost (RSC), Gliricidia vermicompost (GVC), and macrofauna, showed rock phosphate (RP) solubilization in buffered medium in plate culture. When tested in RP broth medium, all five strains, Enterobacter cloacae EB 27, Serratia marcescens EB 67, Serratia sp. EB 75, Pseudomonas sp. CDB 35, and Pseudomonas sp. BWB 21, showed gluconic acid production and solubilized RP. Based on cellulose-degrading and P-solubilizing ability, two strains were selected for further studies. In the presence of different carbon sources, both strains showed a drop in pH and solubilized RP. P released was maximum with glucose (1212 and 522 micromol) and minimum with cellobiose (455 and 306 micromol) by S. marcescens EB 67 and Pseudomonas sp. CDB 35, respectively. Glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) activity was 63 and 77% with galactose and 35 and 46% with cellobiose when compared to glucose (100%) by EB 67 and CDB 35, respectively. Both strains solubilized RP in the presence of different crop residues. EB 67 and CDB 35 showed maximum cellulase activity (0.027 units) in the presence of rice straw and a mixture of rice straw and root. P solubilized from RP in the presence of pigeonpea root was 134 and 140 micromol with EB 67 and CDB 35. Significantly, these bacteria isolated from composts and macrofauna solubilized rock phosphate in the presence of various pure carbon substrates and crop residues and their importance in soil/rhizosphere conditions is discussed.
TI  - Nature of bacteria found on some wards in Sultan Qaboos University Hospital, Oman.
AB  - This study aims to determine what objects lying in the hospital environment or brought in from outside contribute to the introduction of bacteria associated with nosocomial infections. One hundred swab specimens collected from children's toys, sinks, door handles, telephone handsets and flowers brought into the hospital were plated on different culture media. Colonial growth on the media was purified and identified subsequently using standard bacteriological methods. Of the 100 samples cultured, 61 (61%) grew a range of bacteria including Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=14, 23.0%), Acinetobacter spp. (n=13, 21.3%), Serratia spp. (n=9, 14.7%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (n=9, 14.7%), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n=4, 6.6%), Staphylococcus aureus (n=4, 6.6%), Enterobacter cloacae (n=3, 4.9%), Pantoea sp. (n=2, 3.3%), Chryseobacterium sp. (n=2, 3.3%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=1, 1.6%). Although all the Serratia, Enterobacter, Klebsiella and Pantoea species isolates showed varying degrees of resistance to gentamicin, ceftriaxone, cefuroxime and cefotaxime, all were resistant to ampicillin. Chryseobacterium and Stenotrophomonas species isolates were resistant to amikacin, imipenem, gentamicin and ceftazidime, to which only three isolates of Pseudomonas species were resistant. All the staphylococcal isolates were susceptible to methicillin. Although there has been no major outbreak of a nosocomial infection in the hospital, it is strongly recommended that effective control measures (e.g., sampling the hospital water supply, disinfecting children's toys, use of appropriate hand washing and checking some of the disinfectants for presence of bacteria) are needed. These measures are necessary to ensure that the antibiotic-resistant strains identified in this study are not allowed to spread in the hospital.
TI  - Purification, characterization, and gene cloning of 4-hydroxybenzoate decarboxylase of Enterobacter cloacae P240.
AB  - We found the occurrence of 4-hydroxybenzoate decarboxylase in Enterobacter cloacae P240, isolated from soils under anaerobic conditions, and purified the enzyme to homogeneity. The purified enzyme was a homohexamer of identical 60 kDa subunits. The purified decarboxylase catalyzed the nonoxidative decarboxylation of 4-hydroxybenzoate without requiring any cofactors. Its Km value for 4-hydroxybenzoate was 596 microM. The enzyme also catalyzed decarboxylation of 3,4-dihydroxybenzoate, for which the Km value was 6.80 mM. In the presence of 3 M KHCO3 and 20 mM phenol, the decarboxylase catalyzed the reverse carboxylation reaction of phenol to form 4-hydroxybenzoate with a molar conversion yield of 19%. The Km value for phenol was calculated to be 14.8 mM. The gene encoding the 4-hydroxybenzoate decarboxylase was isolated from E. cloacae P240. Nucleotide sequencing of recombinant plasmids revealed that the 4-hydroxybenzoate decarboxylase gene codes for a 475-amino-acid protein. The amino acid sequence of the enzyme is similar to those of 4-hydroxybenzoate decarboxylase of Clostridium hydroxybenzoicum (53% identity), VdcC protein (vanillate decarboxylase) of Streptomyces sp. strain D7 (72%) and 3-octaprenyl-4-hydroxybenzoate decarboxylase of Escherichia coli (28%). The hypothetical proteins, showing 96-97% identities to the primary structure of E. cloacae P240 4-hydroxybenzoate decarboxylase, were found in several bacterial strains.
TI  - Confirmation of E. coli among other thermotolerant coliform bacteria in paper mill effluents, wood chips screening rejects and paper sludges.
AB  - Paper sludges are solid wastes material generated from the paper production, which have been characterized for their chemical contents. Some are rich in wood fiber and are a good carbon source, for example the primary and de-inking paper sludges. Others are made rich in nitrogen and phosphorus by pressing the activated sludge, resulting from the biological water treatments, with the primary sludge, yielding the combined paper sludge. Still, in the absence of sanitary effluents very few studies have addressed the characterization of their coliform microflora. Therefore, this study investigated the thermotolerant coliform population of one paper mill effluent and two paper mill sludges and wood chips screening rejects using chromogenic media. For the first series of analyses, the medium used was Colilert broth and positive tubes were selected to isolate bacteria in pure culture on MacConkey agar. In a second series of analyses, double selective media, based on ss-galactosidase and ss-glucuronidase activities, were used to isolate bacteria. First, the presence of thermotolerant coliforms was detected in low numbers in most water effluents, but showed that the entrance of the thermotolerant coliforms was early in the industrial process. Also, large numbers of thermotolerant coliforms, i.e., 7,000,000 MPN/g sludge (dry weight; d.w.), were found in combined sludges. From this first series of isolations, bacteria were purified on MacConkey medium and identified as Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter sp, E. sakazakii, E. cloacae, Escherichia coli, K. pneumoniae, K. pneumoniae subsp. rhinoscleromatis, K. pneumoniae subsp. ozaenae, K. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, Pantoea sp, Raoultella terrigena, R. planticola. Second, the presence of thermotolerant coliforms was measured at more than 3,700-6,000 MPN/g (d.w) sludge, whereas E. coli was detected from 730 to more than 3,300 MPN/g (d.w.) sludge. The presence of thermotolerant coliform bacteria and E. coli was sometimes detected from wood chips screening rejects in large quantities. Also, indigenous E. coli were able to multiply into the combined sludge, and inoculated E. coli isolates were often able to multiply in wood chips and combined sludge media. In this second series of isolations, API20E and Biolog identified most isolates as E. coli, but others remained unidentified. The sequences of the 16S rDNA confirmed that most isolates were likely E. coli, few Burkholderia spp, but 10% of the isolates remained unidentified. This study points out that the coliform bacteria are introduced by the wood chips in the water effluents, where they can survive throught the primary clarifier and regrow in combined sludges.
TI  - Purification and characterization of TrzF: biuret hydrolysis by allophanate hydrolase supports growth.
AB  - TrzF, the allophanate hydrolase from Enterobacter cloacae strain 99, was cloned,  overexpressed in the presence of a chaperone protein, and purified to homogeneity. Native TrzF had a subunit molecular weight of 65,401 and a subunit stoichiometry of alpha(2) and did not contain significant levels of metals. TrzF showed time-dependent inhibition by phenyl phosphorodiamidate and is a member of the amidase signature protein family. TrzF was highly active in the hydrolysis of allophanate but was not active with urea, despite having been previously considered a urea amidolyase. TrzF showed lower activity with malonamate, malonamide, and biuret. The allophanate hydrolase from Pseudomonas sp. strain ADP, AtzF, was also shown to hydrolyze biuret slowly. Since biuret and allophanate are consecutive metabolites in cyanuric acid metabolism, the low level of biuret hydrolase activity can have physiological significance. A recombinant Escherichia coli strain containing atzD, encoding cyanuric acid hydrolase that produces biuret, and atzF grew slowly on cyanuric acid as a source of nitrogen. The amount of growth produced was consistent with the liberation of 3 mol of ammonia from cyanuric acid. In vitro, TrzF was shown to hydrolyze biuret to liberate 3 mol of ammonia. The biuret hydrolyzing activity of TrzF might also be physiologically relevant in native strains. E. cloacae strain 99 grows on cyanuric acid with a significant accumulation of biuret.
TI  - Mechanical transmission of pathogenic organisms: the role of cockroaches.
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Cockroaches (Diploptera punctata) are basically tropical insects and will do their best to find a home that is both warm and moist. Their involvement in the transmission of tropical diseases is poorly investigated in Africa. METHODS: A study on the bacterial, fungal and parasitic profile of cockroaches trapped in and around houses in Ekpoma was carried out using standard microbiological techniques. RESULTS: Of a total of 234 cockroaches trapped from different sites (toilets, parlours, kitchens and bedrooms) in houses with pit latrines and water system, the bacterial, fungal and parasitic isolates were identical irrespective of the site, these included: E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Salmonella sp, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serretia marcescens, S. aureus, S. feacalis, S. epidermidis, Aeromonas sp, Candida sp, Rhizopus sp, Aspergillus sp, Mucor sp, cysts of E. hystolitica, oocysts of C. parvum, C. cayetenensis and Isospora belli, cysts of Balantidium coli, ova of Ascaris lumbricoides, Anchylostoma deodunalae, Enterobius vermicularis, ova Trichuris trichura, larva of Strongyloides stercoralis. Cockroaches trapped in the toilets of houses with pit latrines had a mean bacterial and parasites count of 12.3 x 10(10) org/ml and 98 parasites/ml respectively, while those trapped in the houses with water system had a mean bacterial and parasitic count of 89.5 x 10(7) org/ml and 31 parasites/ml respectively. A bacterial count of 78.9 x 10(7) org/ml was recorded from cockroaches trapped from the kitchens of houses with pit latrines. On the other hand a mean bacterial and parasitic count of 23.7 x 10(6) org/ml and 19 parasites/ml were recorded from kitchens of houses with water system. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: Cockroaches represent an important reservoir for infectious pathogens, therefore, control of cockroaches will substantially minimise the spread of infectious diseases in our environment.
TI  - [Profiles of the utilization of 20 amino acids as the only source of nitrogen and carbon in bacteria of the genera Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Serratia, Escherichia].
AB  - The profiles of the utilization of 20 protein amino acids in 118 Klebsiella pneumoniae sub- sp. pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, K. planticola, K. mobilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marscescens, S. liquefaciens, Escherichia coli strains isolated from clinical material were studied. The utilization of amino acids was determined on minimal saline agar containing amino acid as the only source of nitrogen and carbon; the results were evaluated after 72-hour incubation at 37 degrees C. 17 profiles of amino-acid utilization were thus determined, most of them genus-specific in enterobacteria: Klebsiella (profiles No. 1--6, 9, 10), Enterobacter (No. 11--13), Serratia (No. 14--16), Escherichia (No. 17). The full coincidence of amino-acid utilization profiles in bacteria of K. mobilis (No. 1, 6) and K. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae with out of such profiles in bacteria of the genera Enterobacter, Serratia, Escherichia was established, which confirmed that K. mobilis (formerly Enterobacter aerogenes) belonged to the genus Klebsiella.
TI  - Rapid, specific and quantitative assays for the detection of the endophytic bacterium Methylobacterium mesophilicum in plants.
AB  - Xylella fastidiosa is a xylem-limited bacterium that causes citrus variegated chlorosis disease in sweet orange. There is evidence that X. fastidiosa interacts with endophytic bacteria present in the xylem of sweet orange, and that these interactions, particularly with Methylobacterium mesophilicum, may affect disease progress. However, these interactions cannot be evaluated in detail until efficient methods for detection and enumeration of these bacteria in planta are developed. We have previously developed standard and quantitative PCR-based assays specific for X. fastidiosa using the LightCycler system [Li, W.B., Pria Jr., L.P.M.W.D., X. Qin, and J.S. Hartung, 2003. Presence of Xylella fastidiosa in sweet orange fruit and seeds and its transmission to seedlings. Phytopathology 93:953-958.], and now report the development of both standard and quantitative PCR assays for M. mesophilicum. The assays are specific for M. mesophilicum and do not amplify DNA from other species of Methylobacterium or other bacteria commonly associated with citrus or plant tissue. Other bacteria tested included Curtobacterium flaccumfaciens, Pantoea agglomerans, Enterobacter cloacae, Bacillus sp., X. fastidiosa, Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. citri, and Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus. We have demonstrated that with these methods we can quantitatively monitor the colonization of xylem by M. mesophilicum during the course of disease development in plants artificially inoculated with both bacteria.
TI  - A toxaphene-degrading bacterium related to Enterobacter cloacae, strain D1 isolated from aged contaminated soil in Nicaragua.
AB  - Enterobacter sp. strain D1 is a facultative anaerobic, Gram-negative heterotrophic bacterium isolated from toxaphene-contaminated soil. This organism was identified and characterized through phylogenetic and taxonomic studies. Based on 16S rDNA analysis, the strain D1 was clustered closely with the species Enterobacter cloacae subsp. dissolvens (LMG 2683) and E. cloacae (ATCC 13047T). Strain D1 resembled these E. cloacae strains with respect to various biochemical and nutritional characteristics, but also exhibited differences. Moreover, strain D1 is able to grow and survive with toxaphene supplied in the medium in the range 3-96 mg/L. Amongst the chemical components of toxaphene, octachlorocamphenes, nonachlorobornanes and decachlorobornanes were seen to be rapidly metabolized, although levels of hexachlorocamphenes and heptachlorobornanes were found to be slowly degraded, and subsequently accumulated during the last stage of the cultivation.
TI  - Molecular analysis of colonized bacteria in a human newborn infant gut.
AB  - The complex ecosystem of intestinal microflora is estimated to harbor approximately 400 different microbial species, mostly bacteria. However, studies on bacterial colonization have mostly been based on culturing methods, which only detect a small fraction of the whole microbiotic ecosystem of the gut. To clarify the initial acquisition and subsequent colonization of bacteria in an infant within the few days after birth, phylogenetic analysis was performed using 16S rDNA sequences from the DNA isolated from feces on the 1st, 3rd, and 6th day. 16S rDNA libraries were constructed with the amplicons of PCR conditions at 30 cycles and 50 degrees c annealing temperature. Nine independent libraries were produced by the application of three sets of primers (set A, set B, and set C) combined with three fecal samples for day 1, day 3, and day 6 of life. Approximately 220 clones (76.7%) of all 325 isolated clones were characterized as known species, while other 105 clones (32.3%) were characterized as unknown species. The library clone with set A universal primers amplifying 350 bp displayed increased diversity by days. Thus, set A primers were better suited for this type of molecular ecological analysis. On the first day of the life of the infant, Enterobacter, Lactococcus lactis, Leuconostoc citreum, and Streptococcus mitis were present. The largest taxonomic group was L. lactis. On the third day of the life of the infant, Enterobacter, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, S. mitis, and Streptococcus salivarius were present. On the sixth day of the life of the infant, Citrobacter, Clostridium difficile, Enterobacter sp., Enterobacter cloacae, and E. coli were present. The largest taxonomic group was E. coli. These results showed that microbiotic diversity changes very rapidly in the few days after birth, and the acquisition of unculturable bacteria expanded rapidly after the third day.
TI  - Enteric fever-like illness caused by infection with citrobacter amalonaticus.
AB  - 'Enteric fever' is a potentially fatal, severe systemic disease, which is encountered worldwide. Traditionally, enteric fever refers to a bacteremic illness caused by members of certain Salmonella serotypes, notably: Salmonella typhi, a Gram-negative bacterium, and to a lesser extent, Salmonella paratyphi A, B and C. In addition, other non-salmonella organisms may produce a syndrome clinically indistinguishable from "enteric fever". Brucella sp., Campylobacter sp., Edwardsiella tarda, Enterobacter Cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Providencia alcalifaciens, Pseudomonas sp., Serratia marcescens, Francisella sp. and Yersinia pp have been identified in enteric fever This is, to the best of the authors' knowledge, the first case of Citrobacter to be reported presenting as enteric fever in a normal host in Thailand.
TI  - Distribution of genes encoding the microbial non-oxidative reversible hydroxyarylic acid decarboxylases/phenol carboxylases.
AB  - Bacterial non-oxidative, reversible multi subunit hydroxyarylic acid decarboxylases/phenol carboxylases are encoded by the three clustered genes, B, C, and D, of approximately 0.6, 1.4, and 0.2 kb, respectively. There are more than 160 homologues in the database with significant similarity to gene B (homology to ubiX) and C (ubiD) distributed in all three microbial domains, however, homologues to gene D, are not numerous ( approximately 15). The occurrence of the entire BCD gene cluster encoding for either identified or presumptive hydroxyarylic acid decarboxylase to date has been revealed in Sedimentibacter hydroxybenzoicus (unique genes arrangement CDB), Streptomyces sp. D7, Bacillus subtilis, B. licheniformis, E. coli O157:H7, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Shigella dysenteriae, Salmonella enterica, S. paratyphi, S. typhimurium, S. bongori, and S. diarizonae. The corresponding genes from S. hydroxybenzoicus, B. subtilis, Streptomyces sp. D7, E. coli O157:H7, K. pneumoniae, and S. typhimurium were cloned and expressed in E. coli DH5alpha (void of analogous genes), and shown to code for proteins exhibiting non-oxidative hydroxyarylic acid decarboxylase activity.
TI  - Enterobacter radicincitans sp. nov., a plant growth promoting species of the family Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - A plant growth promoting bacterial isolate (D5/23T) from the phyllosphere of winter wheat, able to fix atmospheric nitrogen and to produce auxines and cytokinins was investigated in a polyphasic taxonomy approach. Phylogenetic analyses using the 16S rRNA gene sequence of the strain clearly indicated that the strain belonged to the family Enterobacteriaceae, most closely related to Enterobacter cloacae with 99.0% and Enterobacter dissolvens with 98.5% sequence similarity. Phylogenetic analysis derived from the sequence of the rpoB gene showed the highest sequence similarities to Enterobacter cowanii (93.0%) but supported the distinct position of strain D5/23T. The isolate produced a fatty acid pattern typical for members of the family Enterobacteriaceae. On the basis of the phylogenetic analyses, DNA-DNA hybridizations, and the unique physiological and biochemical characteristics, we propose that strain D5/23T represents a new species of the genus Enterobacter for which we propose the name Enterobacter radicincitans sp. nov.
TI  - Description of Enterobacter ludwigii sp. nov., a novel Enterobacter species of clinical relevance.
AB  - A new species, Enterobacter ludwigii, is presented on the basis of the characteristics of 16 strains, which were isolated from clinical specimens. These bacteria form a distinct genetic cluster in phylogenetic analyses of the population structure of the Enterobacter cloacae complex. As determined by DNA-DNA cross-hybridization experiments in microplates, this genetic cluster can be delineated from the other species of the E. cloacae complex with deltaTm values equal to or above 5 degrees C with Enterobacter hormaechei being the closest relative. The bacteria are gram-negative, fermentative, motile rods with the general characteristics of the genus Enterobacter and the E. cloacae complex in particular. E. ludwigii can be differentiated from the other Enterobacter species by its growth on myo-inositol and 3-0-methyl-D-glucopyranose. The type strain is EN-119 (= DSM 16688T = CIP 108491T).
TI  - [Distribution and drug-resistance of 3 500 gram-negative bacteria in Guangzhou].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the distribution and drug-resistance of the common gram-negative bacteria in Guangzhou. METHODS: From July 2001 to August 2003, the resistance of 3 500 strains of common gram-negative bacteria isolated from 13 hospitals in Guangzhou to 15 to 21 antibiotics was determined by standard Kirby-Bauer method according to the guidelines of the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS, 2000). WHONET-5 software was used to analyze the data. RESULTS: Totally 3 500 gram-negative bacterial strains were isolated from 13 hospitals in Guangzhou in the past two years, and the top 3 most common pathogens of them were Escherichia coli (1 244 strains, 35.5%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (900 strains, 25.7%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (547 strains, 15.6 %). The total prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs)-producing strains was 31.0% (1 084/3 500). The prevalences of ESBLs-producing strains in the Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, Acinetobacter SP., other Enterobacter SP., Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and Proteus SP. in Guangzhou were 38.7%, 37.9%, 5.3%, 55.2%, 8.2%, 27.7%, 33.3% and 9.2%, respectively. Among them, 1 463 (41.8%) strains was isolated from the respiratory tract and 943 (26.9%) from the urinary tract. According to our surveillance, the clinical antibacterial drug with the lowest total drug-resistance rates of Gram-negative bacteria was imipenem (8.7%) followed by Cefoperazone/sulbactam (13.3%), while that with the highest resistance was ampicillin (90.9%) followed by nalidixic acid (69.3%). Imipenem was the most effective agents against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Acinetobacter SP., other Enterobacter SP., and Proteus SP. isolated from 13 hospitals in Guangzhou, with drug-resistant rates of 1.1%, 0.5%, 0.6%, 3.2%, 0.8% and 0%, respectively, whereas the most effective agents against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia was cefoperazone/sulbactam, with the drug-resistance rates of 10.8% and 15.9%, respectively. Most of the isolates were multi-drug resistant. The resistance rates of ESBLs-producing strains to 15 to 21 antimicrobial agents were much higher than those of non-ESBLs-producing strains (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Drug resistance of the clinical isolates is a serious problem in Guangzhou, and the increasing prevalence of ESBLs-producing strains of other bacteria should be given full attention. An unanimous and effective strategy for controlling this problem is urgently needed. Imipenem and cefoperazone/sulbactam are the most effective antibiotics against the gram-negative bacteria isolated from the 13 hospitals in Guangzhou.
TI  - Detection of KPC carbapenem-hydrolyzing enzymes in Enterobacter spp. from Brooklyn, New York.
AB  - Enterobacter spp. are rarely resistant to carbapenems. In this report, one Enterobacter sp. isolate possessed bla(KPC-3) and two possessed bla(KPC-2). For all three strains, the imipenem MICs were dependent on the inoculum and testing method; two were reported by the clinical laboratories to be carbapenem susceptible. Improved detection methods will be necessary to identify these enzymes.
TI  - [Development and evaluation of a PCR method for diagnosis of Salmonella enteric fever, based on DNA sequences of the hilA gene].
AB  - Typically, diagnosis of enteric fever due to Salmonella spp. is by bacterial isolation from blood culture; however, the blood culture method is slow, not always available, and not informative in patients with antibiotic treatment. Salmonella spp. uses the hilA gene (component of the pathogenicity island I) to invade epithelial cells and produce infection. Using the hilA gene sequence a PCR test was designed to detect Salmonella in blood samples. The sensitivity (S), specificity (SP), positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of the PCR method were obtained by testing the blood samples from 34 patients with suspected of enteric fever. Presence of S. typhi was confirmed by blood culture. Blood samples were also tested from 35 patients with infections due to other non-Salmonella pathogens, again corroborated by blood culture (Klebsiella pneumoniae, 9; Serratia marcescens, 5; Escherichia coli, 4; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 9; Providencia alcalifaciens, 4; Enterobacter cloacae, 4). Control samples were obtained from 150 healthy volunteers. The S, SP, PPV and NPV for the PCR method were all 100%. The lowest number of colony forming units/ml detected by PCR in blood samples was 10.
TI  - PCR method based on the ogdH gene for the detection of Salmonella spp. from chicken meat samples.
AB  - In a previous paper, the ogdH gene that encodes 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase was  isolated from Salmonella typhimurium. The catalytic N-terminal region in the enzyme was found to be very specific for the Salmonella species. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to detect S. typhimurium in food sources using primers designed for OGDH-1 and OGDH-2 which were based on the salmonella-specific region of the ogdH gene. A simple polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection method was developed to detect low numbers of S. typhimurium in a chicken meat microbial consortium. Using the ogdH-specific primers under stringent amplification conditions and for gene probe analysis, fewer than 100 colony-forming units (CFUs) were detectable when pure cultures were employed. When the PCR assay was run on S. typhimurium-contaminated meat contents, only the positive meat samples containing as few as 200 CFUs reacted to the assay. The method employed for sample processing is simple and it was determined to provide a sensitive means of detecting trace amounts of S. typhimurium-specific sequences in the presence of mixed meat microbial populations. When compared with six representative intestinal gram-negative bacterial strains in foods, including Vibrio parahaemolyticus, V. vulnificus, Enterobacter cloacae, E. coli O157:H7, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus sp., S. typhimurium had a unique and distinct PCR product (796 bp). In conclusion, the two OGDH primers were found to be rapid and sensitive detectors of Salmonella spp for the PCR method.
TI  - Photochemical treatment of platelet concentrates with amotosalen and long-wavelength ultraviolet light inactivates a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial contamination of platelet (PLT) concentrates can result in  transfusion-transmitted sepsis. A photochemical treatment (PCT) process with amotosalen HCl and long-wavelength ultraviolet light (UVA), which cross-links nucleic acids, was developed to inactivate bacteria and other pathogens in PLT concentrates. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: High titers of pathogenic aerobic and anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria (10 species), aerobic Gram-negative bacteria (7 species), and spirochetes (2 species) were added to single-donor PLT concentrates containing 3.0 x 10(11) to 6.0 x 10(11) PLTs in approximately 300 mL of 35 percent plasma and 65 percent PLT additive solution (InterSol, Baxter Healthcare) or saline. After PCT with 150 micro mol per L amotosalen and 3 J per cm(2) UVA, residual bacterial levels were detected by sensitive microbiologic methods. RESULTS: The level of inactivation of viable bacteria was expressed as log reduction. Log reduction of Gram-positive bacteria for Staphylococcus epidermidis was > 6.6; for Staphylococcus aureus, 6.6; for Streptococcus pyogenes, > 6.8; for Listeria monocytogenes, > 6.3; for Corynebacterium minutissimum, > 6.3; for Bacillus cereus (vegetative), > 5.5; for Lactobacillus sp., > 6.4; for Bifidobacterium adolescentis, > 6.0; for Propionibacterium acnes, > 6.2; and for Clostridium perfringens, > 6.5. Log reduction of Gram-negative bacteria for Escherichia coli was > 6.4; for Serratia marcescens, > 6.7; for Klebsiella pneumoniae, > 5.6; for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4.5; for Salmonella choleraesuis, > 6.2; for Yersinia enterocolitica, > 5.9; and for Enterobacter cloacae, 5.9. Log reduction of spirochetes for Treponema pallidum was 6.8 to 7.0, and for Borrelia burgdorferi, > 6.9. CONCLUSION: PCT inactivates high levels of a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria. The inactivation of bacteria in PLT concentrates offers the potential to prospectively prevent PLT-transfusion-associated bacteremia.
TI  - Gamma proteobacteria can nodulate legumes of the genus Hedysarum.
AB  - The bacteria hosted in the root nodules of the three Mediterranean wild legume species Hedysarum carnosum, Hedysarum spinosissimum subsp. capitatum, and Hedysarum pallidum, growing in native stands in different habitats in Algeria were isolated. Bacteria were recovered on yeast-mannitol-agar or on minimal media from a total of 52 nodules. Isolates were analyzed by Amplified Ribosomal DNA Restriction Analysis (ARDRA) using the enzyme CfoI, and further sorted by RAPD fingerprinting. A total of ten different types were found and their amplified 16S rDNA was sequenced and compared to databases. The BLAST alignment indicates that all the species whose sequences share 98 to 100% identity to the bacteria found in these nodules belong to the class Gammaproteobacteria and include Pantoea agglomerans, Enterobacter kobei, Enterobacter cloacae, Leclercia adecarboxylata, Escherichia vulneris, and Pseudomonas sp. No evidence of any rhizobial-like sequence was found even upon amplifying from the bulk of microbial cells obtained from the squashed nodules, suggesting that the exclusive occupants of the nodules formed by the three plants tested are members of the orders Enterobacteriales or Pseudomonadales. This is the first report of Gammaproteobacteria associated with legume nodules. Despite the presence of the related crop plant Hedysarum coronarium, specifically nodulated by Rhizobium sullae, these three Hedysarum species demonstrate to have undergone a separate path in terms of endophytic interactions with bacteria. An hypothesis to account for differences between the symbiotic relationships engaged by man-managed legumes, and those found in plants whose ecology is independent from human action, is discussed.
TI  - Validation of a PCR for diagnosis of typhoid fever and salmonellosis by amplification of the hilA gene in clinical samples from Colombian patients.
AB  - Validation of a PCR test to detect hilA gene sequences of Salmonella spp. was performed in blood and faeces samples from typhoid fever and salmonellosis patients. Sensitivity (S), specificity (SP), positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of the PCR in blood samples were performed by testing: 37 patients with clinical diagnosis of typhoid fever, 34 of them confirmed by isolation of S. Typhi from blood cultures; 35 patients infected with other pathogens corroborated by blood culture (Klebsiella pneumoniae, 9; Serratia marcescens, 5; Escherichia coli, 4; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 9; Providencia alcalifaciens, 4 and Enterobacter cloacae, 4) and blood samples from 150 healthy volunteers. To evaluate S, SP, PPV and NPV of the PCR in faeces samples we studied: 34 patients with enteritis due Salmonella spp. (S. Typhimurium, 21; S. Enteritidis, 9; S. Choleraesuis, 3 and S. Agona, 1); faeces samples from 35 patients with enteric infection due to Shigella sonnei (8), Shigella flexneri (10), enteropathogenic E. coli (12), Aeromonas hydrophila (5) and faeces samples from 150 healthy volunteers. The S, SP, PPV and NPV of the PCR in blood samples were all 100 %. PCR detected three patients with clinical diagnosis of typhoid fever and negative blood cultures. In faeces samples, S was 97 %, SP 100 %, PPV 100 % and NPV 99 %. The lowest number of c.f.u. ml(-1) detected by PCR in blood samples was 1 x 10(1) and in faeces samples 4 x 10(2).
TI  - Mixed quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) study of the deacylation reaction in a penicillin binding protein (PBP) versus in a class C beta-lactamase.
AB  - The origin of the substantial difference in deacylation rates for acyl-enzyme intermediates in penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) and beta-lactamases has remained an unsolved puzzle whose solution is of great importance to understanding bacterial antibiotic resistance. In this work, accurate, large-scale mixed ab initio quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) calculations have been used to study the hydrolysis of acyl-enzyme intermediates formed between cephalothin and the dd-peptidase of Streptomyces sp. R61, a PBP, and the Enterobacter cloacae P99 cephalosporinase, a class C beta-lactamase. Qualitative and, in the case of P99, quantitative agreement was achieved with experimental kinetics. The faster rate of deacylation in the beta-lactamase is attributed to a more favorable electrostatic environment around Tyr150 in P99 (as compared to that for Tyr159 in R61) which facilitates this residue's function as the general base. This is found to be in large part accomplished by the ability of P99 to covalently bind the ligand without concurrent elimination of hydrogen bonds to Tyr150, which proves not to be the case with Tyr159 in R61. This work provides an essential foundation for further work in this area, such as selecting mutations capable of converting the PBP into a beta-lactamase.
TI  - Isolation, characterization, and U(VI)-reducing potential of a facultatively anaerobic, acid-resistant Bacterium from Low-pH, nitrate- and U(VI)-contaminated subsurface sediment and description of Salmonella subterranea sp. nov.
AB  - A facultatively anaerobic, acid-resistant bacterium, designated strain FRCl, was  isolated from a low-pH, nitrate- and U(VI)-contaminated subsurface sediment at site FW-024 at the Natural and Accelerated Bioremediation Research Field Research Center in Oak Ridge, Tenn. Strain FRCl was enriched at pH 4.5 in minimal medium with nitrate as the electron acceptor, hydrogen as the electron donor, and acetate as the carbon source. Clones with 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) sequences identical to the sequence of strain FRCl were also detected in a U(VI)-reducing enrichment culture derived from the same sediment. Cells of strain FRCl were gram-negative motile regular rods 2.0 to 3.4 micro m long and 0.7 to 0.9 microm in diameter. Strain FRCl was positive for indole production, by the methyl red test, and for ornithine decarboxylase; it was negative by the Voges-Proskauer test (for acetylmethylcarbinol production), for urea hydrolysis, for arginine dihydrolase, for lysine decarboxylase, for phenylalanine deaminase, for H(2)S production, and for gelatin hydrolysis. Strain FRCl was capable of using O(2), NO(3)(-), S(2)O(3)(2-), fumarate, and malate as terminal electron acceptors and of reducing U(VI) in the cell suspension. Analysis of the 16S rDNA sequence of the isolate indicated that this strain was 96.4% similar to Salmonella bongori and 96.3% similar to Enterobacter cloacae. Physiological and phylogenetic analyses suggested that strain FRCl belongs to the genus Salmonella and represents a new species, Salmonella subterranea sp. nov.
TI  - The antibacterial innate immune response by the mosquito Aedes aegypti is mediated by hemocytes and independent of Gram type and pathogenicity.
AB  - Previous mosquito studies showed that the hemocyte-mediated innate immune response against Gram- Escherichia coli is phagocytosis, but against Gram+ Micrococcus sp., is melanization. We examined the immune responses mounted by Aedes aegypti towards Gram- Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella typhimurium, and Gram+ Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Using light microscopy, electron microscopy, and survival analysis, this investigation conclusively shows that the factors governing phagocytic vs. melanization responses are complex and independent of bacterial Gram type and pathogenicity. These data provide further evidence that hemocytes are central to the immune response against prokaryotes.
TI  - Sepsis in burned patients.
AB  - A prospective study was conducted from June 2001 to May 2002 at the Burns Unit of Hospital Regional da Asa Norte, Brasilia, Brazil. During the period of the study, 252 patients were treated at the Burns Unit, 49 (19.4%) developed clinically and microbiologically proven sepsis. Twenty-six (53.1%) were males and 23 (46.9%) females with a mean age of 22 years (range one to 89 years) and mean burned body surface area of 37.7 +/- 18.4% (range 7 to 84%). Forty-three patients had flame burns, five a scald and one an electric burn. These 49 patients had a total of 62 septic episodes. Forty (81.6%) patients had only one and nine (18.4%) had up to three episodes of sepsis. Thirty (61.2%) patients had their first septicemic episode either earlier or by one week postburn. Out of 62 septic episodes, 58 were due to bacteria and four due to Candida sp. The most common bacteria isolated from blood culture were Staphylococccus aureus, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterobacter cloacae and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Eleven (18.9%) episodes were due to oxacillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Acinetobacter baumannii was sensitive to ampicillin/sulbactam in 71.4% and to imipenem in 85.7% of the cases. The primary foci of sepsis were the burn wound in 15 (24.2%) episodes. The most common clinical findings of sepsis in these patients were fever, dyspnea, hypotension and oliguria. The most common laboratory findings of these patients were anemia, leukocytosis, hypoalbuminemia and thrombocytopenia. Twelve (24.5%) patients died. The appropriate knowledge of clinical, epidemiological, laboratorial and microbiological aspects of sepsis in burned patients permits an adequate diagnosis and treatment of this complication.
TI  - Microbiological contamination of enteral feeding solutions used in Costa Rican hospitals.
AB  - Enteral feeding is the most common and preferred modality for providing nutritional support to hospital patients with a functional gastrointestinal tract that can not satisfy their nutritional requirements. Nevertheless, enteral feeding may be an important cause of bacterial infection. The aim of this study was to evaluate the microbial contamination level of enteral feedings distributed in Costa Rican hospitals. A total of 124 samples of enteral feeding, coming from five different hospitals from San Jose, Costa Rica, were evaluated during the second semester of 1997 and first of 1998 for the presence and identification of total and fecal coliforms, Pseudomonas sp. and Listeria sp. A subpopulation of the Pseudomonas isolated was analyzed for their antibiotic susceptibility patterns. The concentration of Gram negative rods in the samples of enteral feeding solutions ranged from 10(3) to 10(7) CFU/mL, markedly exceeding the permissible level (10(2) CFU/mL or less). The coliforms most frequently isolated included Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coil, Serratia sp. and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Pseudomonas sp. was isolated in more than 70% of the samples made from commercial based solutions, fruits and vegetables. P. aeruginosa and P. fluorescens were the species most frequently isolated. Listeria sp. was not isolated from enteral solutions samples. The results obtained demonstrate that it is urgent to assure strict hygiene during the preparation and handling of all enteral feed in order to avoid bacterial growth. The implementation of HACCP (Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points) system will be required in a near future for better quality control of enteral nutrition mixtures.
TI  - A low molecular weight enterotoxic hemolysin from clinical Enterobacter cloacae.
AB  - Seven of 50 Enterobacter cloacae strains from clinical isolates produced small turbid zones of hemolysis in horse and sheep blood agar plates, and the culture supernatants were also positive for hemolytic activity. The hemolysin was partially purified from the culture supernatant of E. cloacae by ultrafiltration (PM-10 membrane) and extraction with acetone. Semipurified hemolysin was stable to heating (100 degrees C, 30 min) and was soluble in organic solvents (acetone, ethanol, and methanol). The toxin showed no loss of biological activity after treatment with trypsin and was stable to acid treatment at pH 2.0 but not at a pH greater than 7.0. In the rat intestinal loop assay, the hemolysin caused hemorrhagic fluid accumulation and severe histological alterations. These findings indicate that this hemolysin may be a putative virulence factor in E. cloacae infections.
TI  - [Prostate histopathology of NIH category IV prostatitis detected by sextant prostate needle biopsy from the patients with high prostatic specific antigen].
AB  - Asymptomatic prostatitis is classified as category IV in NIH classification of prostatitis syndrome (1999). No report concerning this category has been present. We investigated this category histopathologically and clinically, in order to clarify the histopathological distribution and its correlation to the clinical features, in this study. Among 785 patients who were suspected prostate cancer because of their high prostatic specific antigen (PSA) values and to have a sextant prostate needle biopsy was performed between January, 1996 and December, 2000, 88 patients (11.2%) were diagnosed as NIH category IV prostatitis (asymptomatic prostatitis). We observed all pathological specimens stained with Hematoxylin-Eosine, and classified them into subtypes according to the classification criteria for prostatitis defined by True et al. (1999). We also investigated the relationship between histopathological distribution and clinical features such as PSA values, PSA density, the incidence of pyuria or bacteriuria. In the histopathological study, grade distributions were 12.5% (11/88) in mild, 71.6% (63/88) in moderate, and 15.9% (14/88) in severe. Location distributions were 2.3% (2/88) in glandular, 68.2% (60/88) in periglandular, and 29.5% (26/88) in stromal. No relationship between these subtypes and clinical features was recognized statistically. However, 7 patients (7.95%) were diagnosed as prostate cancers, later. Pyuria was found in 29.1% (23/79). Bacteriuria was present in 14.3% (11/77). Isolated bacteria were 4 strains of Enterococcus faccalis, 2 strains of each of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus, and one strain of each of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Gram positive rod, and Candida sp. No relationship between these subtypes and bacterial species was recognized. These results indicated that the incidence of NIII category IV prostatits was not low without correlation to any clinical features. However, we should pay attention to the presence of prostate cancer, because a small number of the patients were diagnosed as prostate cancer, later.
TI  - Bacteria in midguts of field-collected Anopheles albimanus block Plasmodium vivax sporogonic development.
AB  - Bacterial infections were investigated in midguts of insectary and field-collected Anopheles albimanus Weidemann from southern Mexico. Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae and Enterobacter amnigenus 2, Enterobacter sp., and Serratia sp. were isolated in field samples obtained in 1998, but only Enterobacter sp. was recovered in field samples of 1997 and no bacteria were isolated from insectary specimens. These bacteria were offered along with Plasmodium vivax infected blood to aseptic insectary An. albimanus, and the number of infected mosquitoes as well as the oocyst densities assessed after 7d. Plasmodium vivax infections in mosquitoes co-infected with En. amnigenus 2, En. cloacae, and S. marcensces were 53, 17, and 210 times, respectively, lower than in control mosquitoes, and the mean oocyst density in mosquitoes co-infected with En. cloacae was 2.5 times lower than in controls. Mortality was 13 times higher in S. marcensces-infected mosquitoes compared with controls. The overall midgut bacterial infection in mosquito field populations may influence P. vivax transmission, and could contribute to explain the annual variations in malaria incidence observed in the area.
TI  - Microbiology of choledochal bile in patients with choledocholithiasis admitted to a tertiary hospital.
AB  - AIM: The present study was designed to investigate the microbiology of choledochal bile of patients with cholangitis and choledocholithiasis. METHODS: We identified and determined the antimicrobial susceptibility of bacteria isolated in the bile of patients with cholangitis and choledocholithiasis diagnosed by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). RESULTS: Nineteen (82.6%) of 23 patients with choledocholithiasis had positive bile cultures. A single agent was detected in 11 patients (57.9%), while a mixed growth, with pathogens ranging from two to three species, were seen in eight patients (42.1%). Patients with clinical manifestations of cholangitis had significantly higher counts of colonies per mL of bile (> 105 cfu/mL). The predominant Gram-negative aerobic bacteria isolated were Escherichia coli (9, 31.0%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (5, 17.2%), Enterobacter cloacae (2, 6.9%), Pantoea agglomerans (1, 3.4%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1, 3.4%). The predominant Gram-positive bacteria were Enterococcus faecalis (5, 17.2%) and Streptococcus sp. (5, 17.2%). Bacteroides fragilis was isolated in one patient with mixed growth. All Gram-positive bacteria isolated in bile were sensitive to ampicillin, and all Gram-negative bacteria isolated were sensitive to gentamicin with a minimum inhibitory concentration (CIM90) ranging from 0.5 to 1.0- micro g/mL. Gram-negative bacteria were also sensitive to imipenem, fluorquinolones, second and third generation cephalosporins. Although all five isolates of E. faecalis were sensitive to ampicillin, two of five (40%) E. faecalis isolates demonstrated high levels of resistance to gentamicin. CONCLUSION: E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. faecalis and Streptoccocus sp. were the most common bacteria isolated in the bile of patients with cholangitis and choledocholithiasis, which were sensitive to a simple therapeutic regimen, such as the combination of ampicilin and gentamicin.
TI  - Diversity of endophytic bacterial populations and their interaction with Xylella  fastidiosa in citrus plants.
AB  - Citrus variegated chlorosis (CVC) is caused by Xylella fastidiosa, a phytopathogenic bacterium that can infect all Citrus sinensis cultivars. The endophytic bacterial communities of healthy, resistant, and CVC-affected citrus plants were studied by using cultivation as well as cultivation-independent techniques. The endophytic communities were assessed in surface-disinfected citrus branches by plating and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Dominant isolates were characterized by fatty-acid methyl ester analysis as Bacillus pumilus, Curtobacterium flaccumfaciens, Enterobacter cloacae, Methylobacterium spp. (including Methylobacterium extorquens, M. fujisawaense, M. mesophilicum, M. radiotolerans, and M. zatmanii), Nocardia sp., Pantoea agglomerans, and Xanthomonas campestris. We observed a relationship between CVC symptoms and the frequency of isolation of species of Methylobacterium, the genus that we most frequently isolated from symptomatic plants. In contrast, we isolated C. flaccumfaciens significantly more frequently from asymptomatic plants than from those with symptoms of CVC while P. agglomerans was frequently isolated from tangerine (Citrus reticulata) and sweet-orange (C. sinensis) plants, irrespective of whether the plants were symptomatic or asymptomatic or showed symptoms of CVC. DGGE analysis of 16S rRNA gene fragments amplified from total plant DNA resulted in several bands that matched those from the bacterial isolates, indicating that DGGE profiles can be used to detect some endophytic bacteria of citrus plants. However, some bands had no match with any isolate, suggesting the occurrence of other, nonculturable or as yet uncultured, endophytic bacteria. A specific band with a high G+C ratio was observed only in asymptomatic plants. The higher frequency of C. flaccumfaciens in asymptomatic plants suggests a role for this organism in the resistance of plants to CVC.
TI  - Detection of Proteobacteria from the rumen by PCR using methanotroph-specific primers.
AB  - AIMS: To detect Proteobacteria, including methanotrophs, from the rumen fluid and the bacteria inhabiting the rumen epithelium. METHODS AND RESULTS: Proteobacteria inhabiting the rumen were detected by PCR using methanotroph-specific primers. The detected Proteobacteria were divided into clusters A, B, and C in addition to one clone, which was distinct from the clusters and closely related to Nitrosomonas sp. The clusters A, B, and C were close to Succinivibrio dextrinosolvens, Enterobacter cloacae, and Actinobacillus minor, respectively. The clones obtained from the rumen fluid each belonged to cluster A or B. The clones obtained from the rumen epithelium belonged to cluster B or C or to Nitrosomonas sp. CONCLUSIONS: It has been assumed that the rumen fluid and the rumen epithelium host different populations of Proteobacteria. Moreover, detection of Nitrosomonas from the rumen epithelium would indicate the possibility that the bacterium oxidizes ammonia and methane on the rumen surface. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: These findings suggest that the rumen fluid and the epithelium support different microbial populations, which would play specific roles in rumen function. Future study should focus on the relationship between these communities and physiological functions in the rumen.
TI  - BUT-1: a new member in the chromosomal inducible class C beta-lactamases family from a clinical isolate of Buttiauxella sp.
AB  - An atypical Enterobacteriaceae strain with a beta-lactam susceptibility pattern of inducible cephalosporinase was isolated in Tenon Hospital (Paris, France) from a patient's skull wound infection. Identifications by the API-50CHE biochemical system and 16S rRNA gene sequencing concluded that it was a member of the Buttiauxella genus. The bla gene was cloned and sequenced. The deduced translated product was a 383-amino acid protein (BUT-1) with 75-78% identity with the chromosomal AmpC beta-lactamases of Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae and Escherichia coli. The isoelectric point of 9.0 and the kinetic constants of BUT-1 were comparable with results described for other Ambler class C enzymes. bla(BUT-1) and the associated ampR transcriptional regulator gene were divergently transcribed from a common intercistronic region, a genetic organization already described for other inducible class C beta-lactamases. The deduced amino acid sequence of AmpR shared 85% and 81% identity with AmpR from E. cloacae and C. freundii respectively.
TI  - Potential microbiological hazards in the production of refined paper products for food applications.
AB  - This study sought to investigate the significance of raw materials (starch-based  glues, raw material papers) at different microbiologically critical stages in the manufacturing process of refined paper products. The study examined the occurrence of microorganisms in the process and in end-product samples. Microbiological surveys verified that the production and use of pasteurized starch-based glue was the most important factor threatening the process hygiene and product safety. Subsequently, the production and use of starch-based glue was changed, and a follow-up programme targeting the microbiological quality of glue was developed as part of a hygiene and safety management system. A total of 33 spore-forming bacterial and 15 enterobacterial isolates were ribotyped, and 22 and 10 different ribogroups (ribotypes), respectively, were generated. These isolates from starch-based glue, raw material paper and end products were atypical and, thus, in many cases physiological, chemotaxonomic (FAME) and molecular (partial 16S rDNA) results did not correspond. The most common spore-forming bacteria (55% of the isolates) were Paenibacillus sp. and within this genus several new species were also proposed. The most common enterobacteria (87%) were Enterobacter cloacae and Citrobacter freundii belonging to bacteria in hazard group 2, or species closely related to them. It was demonstrated that the same spore-forming bacteria (ribotypes) were present in both the glue samples and the end products (45% of isolates). All RiboPrint patterns were saved at the VTT identification library for future use.
TI  - Characterization of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in rendered animal products.
AB  - Antibiotics are used in food animal production to treat diseases and also to improve performance. Antibiotics are not used on all farms, and antibiotic resistance is occasionally found on farms that do not use antibiotics. Rendered animal protein products are often included in poultry feeds and could potentially serve as a source of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. One hundred sixty-five rendered animal protein products from cattle, poultry, and fish were aseptically collected from poultry feed mills. Fifty-five percent of the poultry meal samples had detectable levels of gram-negative bacteria ranging from 40 to 10,440 colony-forming units/g of sample. Poultry meal and meat and bone meal had the greatest number of samples with bacteria resistant to five or more antibiotics. A high percentage of feed samples (85%) contained bacteria resistant to amoxicillin, ampicillin, clavulanic acid, or cephalothin, whereas few samples contained bacteria resistant to ciprofloxacin, kanamycin, or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Citrobacter freundii, and Enterobacter cloacae were the most commonly isolated antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Isolation for Salmonella was also performed, with 14% of the meat and bone meal samples containing Salmonella sp. Only one of the meat and bone meal isolates, Salmonella livingstone, was resistant to five or more antibiotics. Many of the antibiotic-resistant bacteria contained integrons, genetic elements that mediate multiple drug resistance.
TI  - Kinetic study of two novel enantiomeric tricyclic beta-lactams which efficiently  inactivate class C beta-lactamases.
AB  - A detailed kinetic study of the interaction between two ethylidene derivatives of tricyclic carbapenems, Lek 156 and Lek 157, and representative beta-lactamases and D-alanyl-D-alanine peptidases (DD-peptidases) is presented. Both compounds are very efficient inactivators of the Enterobacter cloacae 908R beta-lactamase, which is usually resistant to inhibition. Preliminary experiments indicate that various extended-spectrum class C beta-lactamases (ACT-1, CMY-1, and MIR-1) are also inactivated. With the E. cloacae 908R enzyme, complete inactivation occurs with a second-order rate constant, k(2)/K', of 2 x 10(4) to 4 x 10(4) M(-1) s(-1), and reactivation is very slow, with a half-life of >1 h. Accordingly, Lek 157 significantly decreases the MIC of ampicillin for E. cloacae P99, a constitutive class C beta-lactamase overproducer. With the other serine beta-lactamases tested, the covalent adducts exhibit a wide range of stabilities, with half-lives ranging from long (>4 h with the TEM-1 class A enzyme), to medium (10 to 20 min with the OXA-10 class D enzyme), to short (0.2 to 0.4 s with the NmcA class A beta-lactamase). By contrast, both carbapenems behave as good substrates of the Bacillus cereus metallo-beta-lactamase (class B). The Streptomyces sp. strain R61 and K15 extracellular DD-peptidases exhibit low levels of sensitivity to both compounds.
TI  - Reduction in colonization and nosocomial infection by multiresistant bacteria in  a neonatal unit after institution of educational measures and restriction in the use of cephalosporins.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Previous administration of third-generation cephalosporins predisposes to colonization and infections by multiresistant Enterobacter sp. The emergence of multiresistant bacteria infections in a neonatal unit during 1995, especially Enterobacter cloacae, stimulated this study. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of measures to control colonization and nosocomial infection by multiresistant bacteria in a neonatal unit. SETTING: A tertiary care university hospital. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study was conducted from October 1995 through December 1999 in 4 phases: a cross-sectional study, a longitudinal study with intervention measures, monthly cross-sectional studies, and determination of nosocomial infections caused by multiresistant bacteria (oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and gram-negative bacteria resistant to either aminoglycosides or third-generation cephalosporins). Specimens for surveillance culture were obtained through umbilical and rectal swabs, and tracheal aspirates from intubated babies. The intervention measures were as follows: (1) appropriated training of the whole health care team, emphasizing measures to reduce cross-colonization, and the importance of rational usage of antibiotics and (2) suppression of usage of third-generation cephalosporins. Risk factors were analyzed through univariate and multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: In the first phase, 32% (10/31) of the patients were colonized by multiresistant bacteria (29% by multiresistant E cloacae ). In the second phase, 342 patients were evaluated; 33% of them were colonized by E cloacae, and a multiresistant strain was isolated in 10.8% (37/342) of the babies. A logistic regression model indicated parenteral nutrition and antibiotic usage as risk factors for colonization by multiresistant E cloacae. In the third phase, for 6 months, only 2 patients were colonized by multiresistant E cloacae. In the fourth phase, the analysis of bacterial resistance profile indicated a reduction of nosocomial infections due to multiresistant bacteria from 18 cases in 1995 to 2 cases per year until 1999. CONCLUSION: These results have shown that the measures adopted were effective.
TI  - Variability and interactions between endophytic bacteria and fungi isolated from  leaf tissues of citrus rootstocks.
AB  - Fungi and bacteria were isolated from surface disinfected leaf tissues of several citrus rootstocks. The principal bacterial species isolated were Alcaligenes sp., Bacillus spp. (including B. cereus, B. lentus, B. megaterium, B. pumilus, and B. subtilis), Burkholderia cepacia, Curtobacterium flaccumfaciens, Enterobacter cloacae, Methylobacterium extorquens, and Pantoea agglomerans, with P. agglomerans and B. pumilus being the most frequently isolated species. The most abundant fungal species were Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, Guignardia citricarpa, and Cladosporium sp. Genetic variability between 36 endophytic bacterial isolates was analysed by the random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) technique, which indicated that B. pumilus isolates were more diverse than P. agglomerans isolates, although genetic diversity was not related to the host plants. In vitro interaction studies between G. citricarpa isolates and the most frequently isolated endophytic bacteria showed that metabolites secreted by G. citricarpa have an inhibitory growth effect on some Bacillus species, and a stimulatory growth effect on P. agglomerans.
TI  - Cost-effective and rapid presumptive identification of gram-negative bacilli in routine urine, pus, and stool cultures: evaluation of the use of CHROMagar orientation medium in conjunction with simple biochemical tests.
AB  - The algorithm for a new identification system was designed on the basis of colony color and morphology on CHROMagar Orientation medium in conjunction with simple biochemical tests such as indole (IND), lysine decarboxylase (LDC), and ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) utilization tests with gram-negative bacilli isolated from urine samples as well as pus, stool, and other clinical specimens by the following colony characteristics, biochemical reactions, and serological results: pinkish to red, IND positive (IND(+)), Escherichia coli; metallic blue, IND(+), LDC(+), and ODC negative (ODC(-)), Klebsiella oxytoca; IND(+), LDC(-), and ODC(+), Citrobacter diversus; IND(+) or IND(-), LDC(-), and ODC(-), Citrobacter freundii; IND(-), LDC(+), and ODC(+), Enterobacter aerogenes; IND(-), LDC(-), and ODC(+), Enterobacter cloacae; IND(-), LDC(+), and ODC(-), Klebsiella pneumoniae; diffuse brown and IND(+), Morganella morganii; IND(-), Proteus mirabilis; aqua blue, Serratia marcescens; bluish green and IND(+), Proteus vulgaris; transparent yellow-green, serology positive, Pseudomonas aeruginosa; clear and serology positive, Salmonella sp.; other colors and reactions, the organism was identified by the full identification methods. The accuracy and cost-effectiveness of this new system were prospectively evaluated. During an 8-month period, a total of 345 specimens yielded one or more gram-negative bacilli. A total of 472 gram-negative bacillus isolates were detected on CHROMagar Orientation medium. For 466 of the isolates (98.7%), no discrepancies in the results were obtained on the basis of the identification algorithm. The cost of identification of gram-negative bacilli during this period was reduced by about 70%. The results of this trial for the differentiation of the most commonly encountered gram-negative pathogens in clinical specimens with the new algorithm were favourable in that it permitted reliable detection and presumptive identification. In addition, this rapid identification system not only significantly reduced costs but it also improved the daily work flow within the clinical microbiology laboratory.
TI  - Detection and distribution of insertion sequence 1 (IS1)-containing bacteria in the freshwater environment(1).
AB  - The distribution of insertion sequence 1 (IS1)-containing bacteria was investigated in Windermere (Cumbria, UK), a freshwater body impacted by treated sewage discharge and run-off from the surrounding catchment. Culturable IS1-containing bacteria were recovered from the water column at three depths in Windermere North Basin (WNB) and South Basin (WSB), and from sediment at both sites (at the sediment surface in WSB and to a depth of 12-13 cm in WNB). Polymerase chain reaction amplification of IS1 and the Escherichia coli/Shigella sp. specific gene uidA, from community DNA from shallow sediments, extended the detection limit beyond that of culture at both sites. This detection was extended further into deep sediment extracted from WNB as IS1 and uidA were detected in sub-samples to a depth of 4.7 and 2.3 m, respectively. Analysis of a representative subset of 90 IS1-carrying isolates recovered from water and sediment at both sites demonstrated 21 heterogeneous IS1 profiles with estimated copy numbers ranging from 1 to 16. Identification of the host bacteria showed that the element was confined mainly to Enterobacter spp. However, this study showed IS1 to be present in Citrobacter freundii for the first time. Plasmids were carried by 75.3% of enterobacterial isolates and four plasmids (2.6%) carried IS1. DNA sequence analysis of five IS1 clones demonstrated that IS1 isoforms from this study were similar (>89% nucleotide identity) to known IS1 isoforms. Two isoforms of IS1 from a single Enterobacter cloacae isolate differed by 6.7% at the nucleotide level suggesting that they had been acquired independently.
TI  - Use of oleic acid to reduce the population of the bacterial flora of poultry skin.
AB  - The effect of oleic acid on native bacterial flora of poultry skin was examined.  Skin from commercial broiler carcasses was washed once or twice in solutions of 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, or 10% (wt/vol) oleic acid and rinsed in peptone water. Aerobic bacteria, Enterobacteriaceae, Campylobacter, and enterococci in the rinsates were enumerated. Significantly fewer aerobic bacteria, Enterobacteriaceae, Campylobacter, and enterococci were recovered from rinsates of skin washed in oleic acid than from control samples. Additionally, fewer bacteria were recovered from rinsates of skin washed in higher concentrations of oleic acid than from skin washed in lower concentrations of the fatty acid. In most cases, there was no significant difference in the number of bacteria recovered from rinsates of skin washed once or twice in solutions of oleic acid. Washing skin samples twice in 10% solutions of oleic acid significantly reduced the number of aerobic bacteria, Enterobacteriaceae, Campylobacter, and enterococci that remained attached to the skin. Campylobacter sp., Enterococcus faecalis, and Listeria monocytogenes isolates possessed the least resistance to the antibacterial activity of oleic acid in vitro, while Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa showed higher resistance. Enterobacter cloacae, Staphylococcus lentus, and Salmonella Typhimurium had the greatest resistance to the antibacterial activity of oleic acid. Findings indicate that oleic acid reduces the number of bacteria on the skin of processed broilers and that the fatty acid is bactericidal to several spoilage and pathogenic bacteria associated with poultry.
TI  - Microbiological contamination of enteral feeding solutions used in Costa Rican hospitals.
AB  - Enteral feeding is the most common and preferred modality for providing nutritional support to hospital patients with a functional gastrointestinal tract that can not satisfy their nutritional requirements. Nevertheless, enteral feeding may be an important cause of bacterial infection. The aim of this study was to evaluate the microbial contamination level of enteral feedings distributed in Costa Rican hospitals. A total of 124 samples of enteral feeding, coming from five different hospitals from San Jose, Costa Rica, were evaluated during the second semester of 1997 and first of 1998 for the presence and identification of total and fecal coliforms, Pseudomonas sp. and Listeria sp. A subpopulation of the Pseudomonas isolated was analyzed for their antibiotic susceptibility patterns. The concentration of Gram negative rods in the samples of enteral feeding solutions ranged from 10(3) to 10(7) CFU/mL, markedly exceeding the permissible level (10(2) CFU/mL or less). The coliforms most frequently isolated included Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coil, Serratia sp. and Klebsiella pnuemoniae, Pseudomonas sp. was isolated in more than 70% of the samples made from commercial based solutions, fruits and vegetables. P. aeruginosa and P. fluorescens were the species most frequently isolated. Listeria sp. was not isolated from enteral solutions samples. The results obtained demonstrate that it is urgent to assure strict hygiene during the preparation and handling of all enteral feed in order to avoid bacterial growth. The implementation of HACCP (Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points) system will be required in a near future for better quality control of enteral nutrition mixtures.
TI  - Microbiological investigation on black crusts from open-air stone monuments of Bologna (Italy).
AB  - Samples of black crusts taken from open-air stone monuments in Bologna dating back to between the twelfth and the nineteenth century were considered. The microbiological test procedures isolated from a high number of chemoorganotrophic bacteria, each of the samples although it was expected to find chemo-lithotrophic (specially sulfur-oxidizing and nitrifying) bacteria on account of the great amounts of sulphur, carbon, nitrogen dioxides and ammonia in the air. Sporogenous and asporogenous species were found among the isolated bacteria: the first were recognized as Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus brevis, Bacillus licheniformis, Bacillus mycoides and Bacillus megaterium; the latter were Corynebacterium glutamicum, Actinomyces sp., Alcaligenes denitrificans subsp. denitrificans, Flavobacterium breve, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas stutzeri. These species were differently associated in the samples studied with a frequency of more than sixty-four per cent. This finding leads us to believe that their presence in the black crusts is not occasional, but the result of an ecologically significant process of colonization. Although behavioural tests (solubilization of calcium carbonate, of calcium sulphate and marble dust) did not reveal lithic activity among the bacteria studied, one can presume that their behaviour in nature - as a more or less complex microbial consortium - can be totally different and exert a decomposing action with regard to several minerals, most of them acidify the media in which they develop.
TI  - Neochlamydia hartmannellae gen. nov., sp. nov. (Parachlamydiaceae), an endoparasite of the amoeba Hartmannella vermiformis.
AB  - Free-living amoebae are increasingly being recognized to serve as vehicles of dispersal for various bacterial human pathogens and as hosts for a variety of obligate bacterial endocytobionts. Several Chlamydia-like Acanthamoeba endocytobionts constituting the recently proposed family Parachlamydiaceae are of special interest as potential human pathogens. In this study coccoid bacterial endocytobionts of a Hartmannella vermiformis isolate were analysed. Infection of H. vermiformis with these bacteria resulted in prevention of cyst formation and subsequent host-cell lysis. Transfection experiments demonstrated that the parasites were not capable of propagating within other closely related free-living amoebae but were able to infect the distantly related species Dictyostelium discoideum. Electron microscopy of the parasites revealed typical morphological characteristics of the Chlamydiales, including the existence of a Chlamydia-like life-cycle, but indicated that these endocytobionts, in contrast to Chlamydia species, do not reside within a vacuole. Comparative 16S rRNA sequence analysis showed that the endocytobiont of H. vermiformis, classified as Neochlamydia hartmannellae gen. nov., sp. nov., is affiliated to the family Parachlamydiaceae. Confocal laser scanning microscopy in combination with fluorescence in situ hybridization using rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes confirmed the intracellular localization of the parasites and demonstrated the absence of other bacterial species within the Hartmannella host. These findings extend our knowledge of the phylogenetic diversity of the Parachlamydiaceae and demonstrate for the first time that these endocytobionts can naturally develop within amoebae of the genus Hartmannella.
TI  - [Participation of multiresistant gram-negative rods in systemic infections of newborns treated in the Neonatal Clinics of the University Hospital in Krakow in 1993-1997].
AB  - Results of blood cultures in 1187 newborns hospitalized in the Department of Neonatology, University Hospital in Krakow in furing the last five years were analysed. A trial of monitoring the presence of multi-resistant strains of Enterobacteriaceae with new mechanisms of resistance to antibiotics as well as analysed of their antibiotics susceptibility patterns were undertaken. Surprisingly high percentage of Gram-negative rods E. cloacae and K. pneumoniae strains resistant to the 3rd generation of cephalosporins and participating in septic complications in the investigated hospital environment was demonstrated. There were identified 53 strains of Enterobacter sp., 35 strains of Klebsiella sp. and 3 strains of E. coli extremely resistant to ceftazidine, accounting for 72%, 56% and 5% of all isolated of the given kind, respectively. Dynamic increase in a number of multiresistant strains of K. pneumoniae from 11.1% of isolates in 1993 to 83% in 1997 was shown as well as remaining on a very high level frequency of isolation of Enterobacter sp. rods capable of producing chromosomal cephalosporinases was demonstrated. Full efficacy of carbapenems and high usefulness of ciprofloxacine in the treatment of infections were confirmed. The authors emphasize necessity for constant monitoring of susceptibility to antibiotics in resistant strains as well as for liquidating their sources and ways of their transmission.
TI  - Molecular epidemiology of a nosocomial outbreak due to Enterobacter cloacae and Enterobacter agglomerans in Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil.
AB  - A total of 73 isolates (57 Enterobacter cloacae and 16 Enterobacter agglomerans), recovered during an outbreak of bacteremia in the Campinas area, Sao Paulo, Brazil, were studied. Of these isolates, 61 were from parenteral nutrition solutions, 9 from blood cultures, 2 from a sealed bottle of parenteral nutrition solution, and one was of unknown origin. Of the 57 E. cloacae isolates, 54 were biotype 26, two were biotype 66 and one was non-typable. Of 39 E. cloacae isolates submitted to ribotyping, 87.2% showed the same banding pattern after cleavage with EcoRI and BamHI. No important differences were observed in the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns among E. cloacae isolates exhibiting the same biotype, serotype and ribotype. All E. agglomerans isolates, irrespective of their origin, showed same patterns when cleaved with EcoRI and BamHI. The results of this investigation suggest an intrinsic contamination of parenteral nutrition solutions and incriminate these products as a vehicle of infection in this outbreak.
TI  - The discriminatory power of ribo-PCR compared to conventional ribotyping for epidemiological purposes.
AB  - Molecular typing techniques have become increasingly important for confirmation of epidemiological relationships and delimitation of nosocomial outbreaks. The discriminatory power of the two DNA-based typing methods, conventional ribotyping and ribo-PCR, was assessed to distinguish between selected strains of Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Overall, conventional ribotyping was more discriminatory than ribo-PCR.
TI  - Assessment of bacterial community structure in soil by polymerase chain reaction  and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis.
AB  - Bacterial community structure was studied in a Flevo silt loam (FSL) soil microplot, as well as in 15 other soils, by using DNA extraction followed by molecular fingerprinting. Total community DNA was extracted and purified by a direct method, which yielded amplifiable DNA of high molecular weight for all soils. A variable region of the 16S rRNA gene was then amplified by PCR with bacterial primers, resulting in a mixture of amplicons separable via denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). The DGGE profiles of FSL soil were indicative of dominant soil bacterial types, as evidenced by assessing the amplification of Enterobacter cloacae and Arthrobacter sp. targets in a soil DNA background. These targets produced barely detectable bands when present in soil DNA at roughly 5 x 10(6) genome equivalents per g dry soil, and strong bands at 27-fold higher levels. The PCR-DGGE analysis of the FSL soil was highly reproducible. Furthermore, different single versus composite topsoil samples yielded similar DGGE profiles with respect to major bands. In addition, samples taken along vertical soil cores (0-45 cm depth) revealed relative stability of the DGGE profiles. The profiles produced with DNA obtained from different aggregate size fractions of this soil were also similar with respect to the main bands. Moreover, FSL topsoil samples taken over a 1-year period (fallow soil) yielded stable profiles. These data suggested that the soil bacterial communities thus determined were dominated by a limited number of stable and ubiquitous types. The 16 soils, representing varying types and geographical locations, were assessed for differences in their bacterial DGGE profiles. There were striking differences between the profiles obtained for these soils. Evidence was found for the hypothesis that similar soil types tend to contain similar structures of the dominating bacterial types as revealed by the DGGE profiles.
TI  - Phenotyping and genotyping methods applied to investigate the relatedness of Brazilian isolates of Enterobacter cloacae.
AB  - In order to evaluate the resolving power of several typing methods to identify relatedness among Brazilian strains of Enterobacter cloacae, we selected twenty isolates from different patients on three wards of a University Hospital (Orthopedics, Nephrology, and Hematology). Traditional phenotyping methods applied to isolates included biotyping, antibiotic sensitivity, phage-typing, and O-serotyping. Plasmid profile analysis, ribotyping, and macrorestriction analysis by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) were used as genotyping methods. Sero- and phage-typing were not useful since the majority of isolates could not be subtyped by these methods. Biotyping, antibiogram and plasmid profile permitted us to classify the samples into different groups depending on the method used, and consequently were not reliable. Ribotyping and PFGE were significantly correlated with the clinical epidemiological analysis. PFGE did not type strains containing nonspecific DNase. Ribotyping was the most discriminative method for typing Brazilian isolates of E. cloacae.
TI  - Cloning and expression in Escherichia coli of an azoreductase gene from Clostridium perfringens and comparison with azoreductase genes from other bacteria.
AB  - A genomic library of Clostridium perfringens ATCC 3626 was constructed in phage lambda gt11 and screened with an antibody against the C. perfringens azoreductase, which catalyzes the reduction of azo dyes to aromatic amines. A positive recombinant phage, containing a 3.8 kb DNA fragment insert was selected and purified. Lytic and lysogenic Escherichia coli cultures infected with the recombinant phage had higher azoreductase activity than cultures infected only with the vector lambda gt11. The 3.8 kb DNA fragment was amplified by PCR and found to hybridize with one band from C. perfringens DNA digested with EcoR1, indicating the presence of a single copy of the azoreductase gene. The fragment also hybridized with DNA from other azoreductase-producing Clostridium species, a Eubacterium sp., Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter amalonaticus and E. coli, but not with DNA from some other species of anaerobic bacteria capable of reducing azo dyes. The data indicate that the sequence of the azoreducatse gene of C. perfringens is conserved in some anaerobes and facultative anaerobes, but not in others, and that different types of azoreductase genes must be found in other anaerobic bacteria.
TI  - Conversion of unsaturated fatty acids by bacteria isolated from compost.
AB  - A compost mixture amended with soybean oil was enriched in microorganisms that transformed unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs). When oleic acid or 10-ketostearic acid was the selective fatty acid, Sphingobacterium thalpophilum (NRRL B-23206, NRRL B-23208, NRRL B-23209, NRRL B-23210, NRRL B-23211, NRRL B-23212), Acinetobacter spp. (NRRL B-23207, NRRL B-23213), and Enterobacter cloacae (NRRL B-23264, NRRL B-23265, NRRL B-23266) represented isolates that produced either hydroxystearic acid, ketostearic acid, or incomplete decarboxylations. When ricinoleic (12-hydroxy-9-octadecenoic) acid was the selective UFA, Enterobacter cloacae (NRRL B-23257, NRRL B-23267) and Escherichia sp. (NRRL B-23259) produced 12-C and 14-C homologous compounds, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (NRRL B-23256, NRRL B-23260) converted ricinoleate to a trihydroxyoctadecenoate product. Also, various Enterobacter, Pseudomonas, and Serratia spp. appeared to decarboxylate linoleate substrate incompletely. These saprophytic, compost bacteria were aerobic or facultative anaerobic Gram-negative and decomposed UFAs through decarboxylation, hydroxylation, and hydroperoxidation mechanisms.
TI  - Type I beta-lactamases of Enterobacter cloacae and resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  - The interaction of type-I beta-lactamases from Enterobacter cloacae with diverse  beta-lactam compounds was examined. The ability of penicillin and cefoxitin to induce beta-lactamase production in this strain was assessed. The effect of beta-lactamase inhibitors was measured on beta-lactamase extracts and on intact cells. E. cloacae 78 strain is a stably derepressed mutant showing limited susceptibility to a number of antibiotics except imipenem. Imipenem would therefore be the appropriate choice for therapy of infections caused by stably derepressed mutants of Enterobacter sp. producing type-I beta-lactamases.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of ACC deaminase genes from two different plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria.
AB  - We have recently proposed that one way that plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria  (PGPR) stimulate plant growth is through the activity of the enzyme 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) deaminase, which causes a lowering of plant ethylene levels resulting in longer roots. As part of an effort to understand the role of this enzyme in PGPR, the genes for ACC deaminase from two PGPR, Enterobacter cloacae CAL2 and UW4, have been isolated. These genes are highly homologous to the ACC deaminase genes from Pseudomonas strains 6G5 and F17 and similar to the ACC deaminase gene from Pseudomonas sp. strain ACP. The region downstream (i.e., at the 3'-terminal end) of the strain UW4 ACC deaminase gene has a potential hairpin-like transcription termination site. The regions upstream of the strains UW4 and CAL2 ACC deaminase genes contain putative ribosome-binding sites; however, the promoter sequences have not yet been identified. Southern hybridization experiments suggest that there is a single copy of the ACC deaminase gene in Enterobacter cloacae strains UW4 and CAL2 and that there may be several different types of ACC deaminase genes in different microbes. The cloned ACC deaminase gene can be expressed in Escherichia coli enabling this bacterium to grow on ACC as a sole source of nitrogen and confers upon both Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas spp. strains that are transformed with this gene the ability to promote the elongation of the roots of canola seedlings.
TI  - [Enterobacter amnigenus. An unusual human pathogen].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Enterobacter amnigenus is a bacteria with doubtful pathogenicity. The observation of a patient with a well-documented E. amnigenus infection has prompted us to review the pathology caused by this microorganism. METHODS: Retrospective evaluation of the clinical charts of patients with any isolate positive for E. amnigenus over a period of 46 months. Based on the clinical data, presence or absence of other causal microorganisms and/or alternative diagnosis, E. amnigenus was classified as definitive, probable, or improbable cause of infection. RESULTS: We analyzed 15 E. amnigenus isolates, representing 0.97 of 10,000, the total bacterial isolates in our laboratory for this period, and 0.52% of those corresponding to Enterobacter sp. We were able to clinically evaluate E. amnigenus in 7 patients, in whom infection by this microorganism was classified as definitive in 4, probable in 1, and improbable in 2. Antibiotic susceptibility studies showed a resistance level of 83% to ampicillin, 75% to cefazoline and cefoxitine, and 33% to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. All isolates were susceptible to third-generation cephalosporins, aztreonam, ciprofloxacin, cotrimoxazole and aminoglycosides. CONCLUSIONS: E. amnigenus cause well-documented bacterial infection in man. Thus, isolation of this microorganism should not be considered as a contaminant or simple colonizer. The clinical behavior and antimicrobial susceptibility of E. amnigenus is similar to that of E. cloacae, a taxonomically-related species.
TI  - [Antibiotic sensitivity to isolated bacteria in pediatric urinary tract infections].
AB  - Of the childhood urinary tract infections, more than 50% are caused by Escherichia coli (E Coli), followed by Proteus mirabilis (P mirabilis), Klebsiella sp, other enterobacteria, enterococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and staphylococci. Of E coli isolates, 50 to 60% are resistant to ampicillin (ampi-R), 10% being susceptible to amoxicillin + clavulanic acid (AMC). For P mirabilis, ampi-R isolates are less frequent and more often susceptible to AMC. Klebsiella sp is resistant to ampicillin, 75% of isolates being susceptible to AMC. In these three species, the susceptibility of isolates to third generation cephalosporins, aminogly-cosides, and ciprofloxacin is still high (> 90%), but 15 to 35% are resistant to cotrimoxazole. In the other enterobacteria (Enterobacter cloacae, Morganella morganii, P vulgaris, Citrobacter freundii and Serratia marcescens) the resistance to cefalotin (hence to ampicillin and AMC) is permanent, with an exception: the susceptibility of P vulgaris to AMC. Enterococci are mostly susceptible to ampicillin, and P aeruginosa to ceftazidime, but in both species, the percentage of resistant strains in hospitalised patients is greater than in outpatients. For Staphylococcus aureus, the community-acquired isolates are susceptible to oxacillin and other anti-staphylococcal agents. All the coagulase negative staphylococci isolates are susceptible to vancomycin, but 70% of those from hospitalised patients are resistant to oxacillin, aminoglycosides and cotrimoxazole.
TI  - [Bacteremia after endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with and without therapeutic procedure: frequency, associated factors and clinical significance].
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine the frequency, associate factors and clinical features of bacteremia in patients undergoing endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), with or without therapeutic procedures. METHODS: Prospectively, 42 consecutives patients undergoing 46 endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatographies (ERCPs) from August to December 1994 were analyzed. The search for bacteremia was done by drawing 6 blood samples for cultures from peripheral blood. Two blood samples were collected before the ERCP and 4 of them after. The bottles used for cultures were Bactec bottles. The bottles were incubated in the Bactec 9240 system, and eventual bacteria detect were identificated by the manual routine of the laboratory and also with the autoScan/Microscan system. RESULTS: All blood cultures obtained before the ERCPs were negatives. Bacteremia were detected after 7 endoscopic procedures. In two episodes of bacteremia, the microorganism identified (Staphylococcus epidermidis) was considered to be a contaminant. The other 5 episodes of bacteremia were considered true bacteremia (frequency- 10.9%), and the microorganisms identified were: Streptococcus viridans, Corynebacterium sp., Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiello oxytoca and Enterobacter aerogenes. This episodes were more frequent in the blood cultures obtained immediately after the ERCPs (p < 0.05), and occurred exclusively in the patients who were not receiving antibiotics (p = 0.0192). Clinical manifestation of the episodes of bacteremia were not detected. CONCLUSION: The episodes of bacteremia occurred exclusively in the patients who were not receiving antibiotics, were transient and completely no symptomatic.
TI  - Occurrence of virulence-associated properties in Enterobacter cloacae.
AB  - Enterobacter cloacae is not a primary human pathogen but has been considered to be an important cause of nosocomial infections. Even so, there are almost no reports on its ability to produce recognized virulence-associated properties. In this study, we show that most of the E. cloacae strains examined were resistant to serum bactericidal activity and were able to produce aerobactin and mannose-sensitive hemagglutinin, and all of them could adhere to and invade HEp-2 cells. Since E. cloacae is part of the normal intestinal floras of many individuals, we believe that infectious disease due to endogenous E. cloacae might be a result of both host predisposing factors and the bacterial virulence determinants that we have detected in this survey.
TI  - Some properties and action mode of (1-->4)-alpha-L-guluronan lyase from Enterobacter cloacae M-1.
AB  - An intracellular alginate lyase was purified from Enterobacter cloacae M-1 by successive fractionation on Q Sepharose FF, SP Sepharose FF, and Sephacryl S-200 HR. The purified enzyme gave a single band on SDS-PAGE and isoelectric focusing. The enzyme easily degraded polyguluronate and produced unsaturated oligoguluronic acids with a wide range of dp. The major end product of the enzyme reaction on polyguluronate was unsaturated triuronic acid. The pattern of oligoguluronic acids (dp 2-9) generated with the enzyme was investigated by fluorophore-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis. The enzyme was not capable of degrading oligoguluronic acids having dp < 4. The degradation rate of heptaguluronic acid by this enzyme remarkably increased, compared with that of hexaguluronic acid, and heptaguluronic acid had a single preferential point of cleavage by this enzyme. On the basis of the cleavage pattern of oligoguluronic acids, the number of subsites was estimated to be seven for this enzyme. The catalytic site of the enzyme is located between the second and the third subsites from the non-reducing end.
TI  - Reductive and hydrolytic activities of enteric bacteria on food colours.
AB  - Reductive and hydrolytic activities on two food colours namely metanil yellow and indigo carmine by different strains of enteric bacteria were evaluated. Enteric bacteria possessed both reductive and hydrolytic capabilities which depended upon the incubation period and the type of strain. In certain bacterial strains, (Escherichia coli and Vibrio sp.), reductive activity was visible after 3 hr. Other enteric strains showed an increasing activity right from the beginning of incubation. Enterobacter cloacae appeared to be producing maximum reductive capability followed by Enterobacter aerogenes and E. coli. Even enteric bacterial strains demonstrated a good response in obtaining hydrolytic activity of indigo carmine during incubation upto 10 hr, establishing the fact that the gut microflora may cause health problem to consumers.
TI  - Isolation of an Acanthamoeba strain with intracellular Burkholderia pickettii infection.
AB  - Burkholderia pickettii is a facultative pathogen that has been isolated from patient sources and environmental sources including respiratory therapy solutions, deionized water and aqueous disinfectants. The organism has been associated with septicemia and respiratory tract infections. In our investigation, Burkholderia pickettii (biovar 2) was for the first time isolated from Acanthamoeba sp. (group II), a free living amoeba species recovered from the wet area of a physiotherapy unit. Pathogenic strains of acanthamoebae may cause amoebic-encephalitis (AE) and keratitis. Light and electron microscopic examinations showed that in a first step, the bacterial were phagocytized by the amoebae. In contrast to Enterobacter cloacae and Escherichia coli that were used as food organisms and digested within food vacuoles, Burkholderia pickettii caused the amoebae to develop large vacuoles filled with completely intact and motile bacteria. 3-5 days after infection, Pseudomonas pickettii had multiplied within the enlarging parasitophorous vacuoles. Ultrastructural changes in the host cells occurred and the amoebae finally underwent rupture or lysis. In cocultivation assays we could not only reinfect the original host amoeba but Acanthamoeba strains from other habitats could successfully be infected with Burkholderia pickettii as well.
TI  - Enterobacter kobei sp. nov., a new species of the family Enterobacteriaceae resembling Enterobacter cloacae.
AB  - The name Enterobacter kobei sp. nov. is proposed for a group of organisms referred to as NIH Group 21 at the National Institute of Health, Tokyo. The members of this species are Gram-negative, motile rods conforming to the definition of the family Enterobacteriaceae. The DNA relatedness of 23 strains of NIH Group 21 to the representative proposed as the type strain of this species averaged 82% at 70 degrees C, whereas the relatedness to other species within the family Enterobacteriaceae was less than 42%. Because the phenotypic resemblance to Enterobacter cloacae is very close and the DNA relatedness (12-42%) is closer to species of the genus Enterobacter than to other species of the family, the members of NIH Group 21 were placed in the genus Enterobacter. Close phenotypic and genetic relationships were also found between NIH Group 21 and a member of a group of organisms referred to as Enteric Group 69 at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Atlanta, Georgia, USA. It is suggested that the latter could be regarded as a subspecific rank of E. kobei, though this is subject to study of further strains. The majority of strains of E. kobei were isolated from clinical specimens. A culture of the type strain (NIH 1485-79) has been deposited in the Japan Collection of Microorganisms as JCM 8580.
TI  - The origin, by mutation, of high level resistance to ceftazidime and cefotaxime in a clinical isolate of Enterobacter cloacae.
AB  - Although strains of Enterobacter sp. produce a chromosomal AmpC beta-lactamase, they have been, in general, susceptible to cefotaxime or ceftazidime. But now resistance to ceftazidime has increased in nosocomial Enterobacter strains, reaching the level of 40%. A chromosomal mutation in the amp operon coding the production of AmpC type beta-lactamase may cause a change in the conversion of a susceptible strain of Enterobacter to a highly resistant mutant. The production of AmpC enzyme is inducible and third-generation cephalosporins are weak inducers of AmpC production. Spontaneous mutations (or insertions of transposons) in the regulatory region of amp operon might create constitutive (derepressed) overproducers of large amounts of AmpC molecules. As a consequence, such cells acquire a stable resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics including cefotaxime or ceftazidime. We describe the origin of mutants of a clinical isolate of Enterobacter cloacae that acquired high-level resistance to ceftazidime followed by the resistance to cefotaxime and/or aztreonam due to a second mutation.
TI  - Adhesive properties and antibiotic resistance of Klebsiella, Enterobacter, and Serratia clinical isolates involved in nosocomial infections.
AB  - Intestinal colonization by Klebsiella, Enterobacter, and Serratia (KES) strains is a crucial step in the development of nosocomial infections. We studied the adhesive properties, antibiotic resistance, and involvement in colonization or infection of 103 KES clinical isolates: 30 Klebsiella pneumoniae (29%), 16 Klebsiella oxytoca (15%), 30 Enterobacter aerogenes (29%), 14 Enterobacter cloacae (14%), and 13 Serratia sp. (13%) isolates. Half of them were resistant to several antimicrobial agents, including aminoglycosides and beta-lactam antibiotics. A total of 27 of 30 K. pneumoniae isolates (90%) adhered to the human cell line Intestine-407 (Int-407), while none of the K. oxytoca or E. aerogenes isolates and only 2 of the E. cloacae isolates adhered. Three adhesive patterns were observed for K. pneumoniae: an aggregative adhesion in 57% of the isolates, a diffuse adhesion in only one isolate, and a new pattern, localized adhesion, in 30% of the isolates. While most of the sensitive strains adhered with the aggregative phenotype, the localized pattern was associated with resistant K. pneumoniae isolates producing the CAZ-5 beta-lactamase. Furthermore, 45% of such localized-adhesion isolates were involved in severe infections. The distributions of type 1 and type 3 fimbriae, enteroaggregative E. coli, and cf29, pap, and afa/Dr adhesin-encoding genes were determined by using specific DNA probes. No relationship was found between the adhesive pattern and the production of specific fimbriae, suggesting that several unrecognized adhesive factors are involved. Our study indicates that special adhesive properties associated with resistance to antimicrobial agents could account for the pathogenicity of certain nosocomial strains.
TI  - [Kinetics of bactericidal activity of cefepime and cefpirome alone or combined with gentamicin, amikacin or ciprofloxacin against Acinetobacter baumannii, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Enterobacter cloacae hyperproductive in cephalosporinase].
AB  - Nosocomial infections encountered in intensive care units are frequently due to Gram negative bacilli among which Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Acinetobacter sp., and Enterobacter sp. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the in vitro bactericidal activity of the new broad spectrum cephalosporins cefepime (FEP) and cefpirome (CPO) alone or in combination with amikacin (AKN), gentamicin (GTN) or ciprofloxacin (CIP) against Acinetobacter baumannii, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Enterobacter cloacae producing a derepressed cephalosporinase. This study was performed by using the time-kill curve method on 24 h with a starting inoculum of 10(6) - 10(7) cfu/ml. The combination of FEP (4 mg/l) with AKN (4 mg/l) against A. baumanii only results in about 1 log decrease at 24 h, but when FEP is combined at 8 mg/l, the decrease reaches 4 log in 24 h. The combination of FEP (16 and 32 mg/l) clavulanic acid (4 mg/l) resulted in 3 log decrease at 24 h. When combined with CIP 2 mg/l, FEP (16 and 32 mg) resulted in 5 and 6 log decrease in 24 h respectively. There were no survival bacteria at 6 h when FEP (32 mg/l) was combined with clavulanic acid (4 mg/l) and GTN (8 mg/l) at 6 h. Used alone FEP (1 mg/l) or CPO (1 mg/l) against E. cloacae, a 3 log decrease occurs at 6 h followed by a regrowth at 24 h. Combined with AKN (2 mg/l), FEP (1 mg/l) results in a 6 log decrease at 24 h, when CPO at 2 mg/l is needed for an equivalent result. These data show synergistic bactericidal activity of both new extended cephalosporins combined with AKN, GTN or CIP at concentrations achievable in biological fluid with adaptative dosage regimen.
TI  - [Variation in transfer resistance to cefotaxime, ceftazidime and aztreonam in strains of Acinetobacter sp., Enterobacter sp. and Citrobacter sp. isolated from the same university hospitals].
AB  - BACKGROUND: In the last decade were in SR documented new problems in resistance to the newer antibiotics that with regard to their structure and antibacterial properties resisted to the known mechanism of bacterial resistance. The emergence of multiple drug resistance to the new betalactams is connected both with frequent application of these drugs in the hospitals and transfer of R plasmids. METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied composition and transferability of resistance to newer betalactam antibiotics in strains of Acinetobacter sp., Enterobacter sp, and Citrobacter sp. isolated during one month in patients from two teaching University Hospitals. All strains studied were resistant to cefotaxime (CTX), ceftazidime (CAZ) and aztreonam (ATM) but Acinetobacter strains, although resistant also to CAZ and ATM transferred the resistance to CTX only. Thus, resistance to CAZ and ATM has a chromosomal origin in these strains. A strain of Citrobacter sp., resistant to CTX, CAZ and ATM, produced a ESBL betalactamase detectable in a double-disk diffusion method (Fig. 1). An Enterobacter cloacae strain transfers directly the resistance to all new betalactams indicated. Their hydrolysis by these strains points to their production of new types of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases ESBL). CONCLUSIONS: We strongly recommend to be strictly rational in the use of new betalactams of CTX, CZA or ATM type because it is suspected that, especially in so-called empirical prophylaxis or treatment, they exert a strong selective pressure toward the prevalence of mutants with transferable ESBL-producing nosocomial bacteria resistant to these drugs.
TI  - A comparative study of the BBL crystal enteric/nonfermenter identification system and the biomerieux API20E and API20NE identification systems after overnight incubation.
AB  - The BBL Crystal Enteric/Nonfermenter (Crystal, Becton Dickinson Microbiology Systems) is a new multi-test identification system for Gram negative rods requiring no oil overlay or addition of reagents. One hundred and three selected Gram negative rod isolates from routine clinical specimens were tested in parallel using the appropriate API20E or API20NE (BioMerieux) reading after overnight incubation. The isolates included in the study, and the number tested, were as follows: Acinetobacter sp, 8; Aeromonas hydrophila, 1; Citrobacter diversus, 1; Citrobacter freundii, 1; Escherichia coli, 13; Enterobacter aerogenes, 10; Enterobacter agglomerans, 2; Enterobacter cloacae, 6; Klebsiella oxytoca, 6; Klebsiella pneumoniae, 12; Morganella morganii, 2; Proteus mirabilis, 6; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 21; Salmonella sp, 2; Salmonella typhi, 1; Serratia marcescens, 1; Shigella sonnei, 2; Shigella sp, 2; Vibrio metschnikovii, 1; Xanthomonas maltophilia, 3; and, Yersinia enterocolitica, 2. The API20E and API20NE systems combined identified 74.8% (77/103) and the Crystal 97.1% (100/103) of isolates. Twenty six isolates required repeat and/or additional tests for correct identification with the API systems compared to 3 with the Crystal. Crystal is more convenient than API for routine clinical use because it requires fewer repeat and/or extra tests, and is easier and less time consuming to use.
TI  - Role of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in the design of dosage schedules for 12-h cefotaxime alone and in combination with other antibiotics.
AB  - Pharmacodynamic principles have provided important tools to evaluate and compare  antimicrobial agents, and well as to guide dosing. For beta-lactams, time above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) has surfaced as the most important factor. However, the area under the inhibitory serum concentration time-curve (AUIC) may be superior when appropriate dosing intervals are selected. Although the target time over the MIC is unclear in humans even when concentrations remain continuously above the MIC, a higher AUIC predicts better clinical outcome up to a maximum. This article provides a pharmacodynamic assessment of 1- and 2-g doses of cefotaxime every 12 h. AUIC24 values and published MIC values for common pathogens (grouped into four groups based on MIC90) were used to predict organisms suitable for treatment with every-12-h regimes. Cefotaxime was inadequate for group 4 organisms including: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acienetobacter sp., and Enterococcus sp. Organisms such as Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus aureus, and B. fragilis may be suboptimally treated with cefotaxime every 12 h. Cefotaxime in doses of 1-2 g every 12 h should be useful in patients with normal renal function infected with organisms having MICs < 0.5 microgram/ml. This regimen should obtain AUIC24 values > 125 and ensure adequate time above the MIC. In patients with impaired renal function, because of a longer half-life and higher area under the curve, pathogens with MIC values in the 0.5-2 micrograms/ml range may be treated with cefotaxime every 12 h while maintaining AUICs > 125. Data are also presented for cefotaxime 2 g every 8 h alone and in combination with ofloxacin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Purification and characterization of extracellular alginate lyase from Enterobacter cloacae M-1.
AB  - An alginate lyase from the culture supernatant of Enterobacter cloacae M-1 was purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation, cation-exchange chromatography (SP-Toyopearl), and gel filtration (Ultrogel AcA44). The final preparation thus obtained showed a single band on SDS-PAGE. The purified enzyme had the molecular weight of 38,000 and 32,000 by SDS-PAGE and gel filtration, respectively. The pI of the enzyme was 8.9. The optimum pH and temperature for the enzyme reaction were around 7.8 and 30 degrees C, respectively. The enzyme was unstable on heating. EDTA completely inhibited the enzyme activity, but the activity was completely restored by the treatment with CaCl2. The enzyme was specific for poly-guluronate and produced several kinds of unsaturated oligomers from the gluluronate. This suggested that the enzyme could be classified as an endo poly-guluronate lyase.
TI  - The danger of infections of the hospitalized patients with the microorganisms present in preparations and in the hospital environment.
AB  - Two strains-S. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococcus, resistant to antibiotics, were isolated from previously non-opened preparations made by the hospital pharmacy and industrially produced. After application in the surgery ward, two Enterobacter agglomerans strains, resistant to antibiotics were detected in oral mixtures. The resistant bacteria, B. cereus and 4 strains of Ps. aeruginosa, were also found in the purified water. In hospital environment 9 strains of staphylococci, resistant to the tested antibiotics were found. Only one of them was S. aureus (detected on the wall), the others being coagulase-negative staphylococci. Most of them were isolated from the floor, but also from the wall, table and from the air in surgical and ophthalmological wards and in the hospital pharmacy. The most dangerous were three Gram-negative strains resistant to all tested antibiotics. They were isolated from the floor (Enterobacter cloacae), from the wall (Proteus mirabilis) and from the container with oral mixture in infant ward (Ps. malthophilia). Many strains resistant to many antibiotics were detected on the floor of surgical, nephrological and infantile wards as well as from the pharmacies: Enterobacter cloacae (7 strains), Citrobacter freundi, Ps. aeruginosa, Ps. cepacia (2 strains), Ps. maltophilia (2 strains) and Moraxella. Many resistant strains were also present on the walls (E. coli, Ps. mirabilis, Ps. cepacia, Alcaligens, Acinetobacter). The resistant strains were rarely observed on the table, medical equipment and on personnel hands. Klebsiella oxytoca and Ps. paucimobilis were found on the table, Ps. maltophilia on the dropper and on the rim of the container with oral mixture. Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas sp. were isolated from the medicine glass, Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas sp. from the personnel hands in the pharmacies.
TI  - Variability of peptidoglycan structural parameters in gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Muropeptide composition of peptidoglycan from the Gram-negative bacteria Aeromonas sp., Acinetobacter acetoaceticus, Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus morganii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas putida, Vibrio parahaemolyticus Yersinia enterocolitica and Escherichia coli, was analyzed by HPLC. In all instances peptidoglycan was built up from the same subunits. A wide disparity in the relative abundance of muropeptides and all structural parameters was observed. The contribution of LD-A2pm-A2pm cross-linked muropeptides was extremely variable; from 1 to 45% of cross-linked muropeptides. Muropeptides with the dipeptides Lys-Lys or Arg-Lys, indicative of murein-bound (lipo)proteins, were detected in all instances although abundance was very variable.
TI  - Potential of genes and gene products from Trichoderma sp. and Gliocladium sp. for the development of biological pesticides.
AB  - Fungal cell wall degrading enzymes produced by the biocontrol fungi Trichoderma harzianum and Gliocladium virens are strong inhibitors of spore germination and hyphal elongation of a number of phytopathogenic fungi. The purified enzymes include chitinolytic enzymes with different modes of action or different substrate specificity and glucanolytic enzymes with exo-activity. A variety of synergistic interactions were found when different enzymes were combined or associated with biotic or abiotic antifungal agents. The levels of inhibition obtained by using enzyme combinations were, in some cases, comparable with commercial fungicides. Moreover, the antifungal interaction between enzymes and common fungicides allowed the reduction of the chemical doses up to 200-fold. Chitinolytic and glucanolytic enzymes from T. harzianum were able to improve substantially the antifungal ability of a biocontrol strain of Enterobacter cloacae. DNA fragments containing genes encoding for different chitinolytic enzymes were isolated from a cDNA library of T. harzianum and cloned for mechanistic studies and biocontrol purposes. Our results provide additional information on the role of lytic enzymes in processes of biocontrol and strongly suggest the use of lytic enzymes and their genes for biological control of plant diseases.
TI  - The pattern of respiratory infection in patients with lung cancer.
AB  - We examined retrospectively the pattern of respiratory infection in 579 patients  with lung cancer admitted to Nagasaki University Hospital during the past 15 years. A total of 139 patients (24.0%) developed respiratory infection. The rates of pulmonary infection associated with large (36.2%) and small cell carcinomas (33.6%) were significantly higher than those with squamous cell carcinoma (26.0%) and adenocarcinoma (17.3%). Advanced stages of lung cancer were associated with higher complication rates (stage I: 6.3%, stage II: 15.9%, stage III: 27.9%, and stage IV: 33.8%). Deceased patients showed a significantly higher rate of pulmonary infection than alive patients during the period of investigation. Isolated organisms in excess of 10(7) cfu/ml in sputum or 10(4) cfu/ml in bronchial aspirate were mainly gram-negative bacteria (68.8%), such as Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Acinetobacter sp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The number of patients infected with gram-positive bacteria increased markedly after 1982. Our results suggest that a successful control of pulmonary infection associated with lung cancer is important in improving the prognosis of lung malignancy.
TI  - Optimization of Novel Extracellular Polysaccharide Production by an Enterobacter  sp, on Wood Hydrolysates.
AB  - An environmental isolate identified as Enterobacter cloacae has been found to produce a highly viscous, anionic extracellular polysaccharide (EPS) from a weak mineral acid hydrolysate of hardwood. Production of this EPS has been optimized on the hydrolysate (initial pH, 6.3; NH(4)Cl amendment, 0.1%) so that crude yields approaching 9.83 g/liter were obtained. Although this EPS is polydisperse, its molecular mass as determined by gel exclusion chromatography centers at approximately 1,700 kDa. Solutions of this EPS have been examined rheologically under a variety of conditions and compare favorably with both xanthan and alginate.
TI  - Evaluation of RapID onE system for identification of 379 strains in the family Enterobacteriaceae and oxidase-negative, gram-negative nonfermenters.
AB  - The ability of the RapID onE system (Innovative Diagnostic Systems, Inc., Norcross, Ga.) to identify 364 strains in the family Enterobacteriaceae and 15 oxidase-negative, gram-negative, nonfermentative rods was evaluated. Kits were inoculated with no. 2 McFarland standard suspensions, and reactions were interpreted after 4 h of incubation at 35 degrees C. Overall, the method correctly identified (to the species level or to the genus level for salmonellas and non-Shigella sonnei Shigella species) 363 strains (95.8%) without additional tests. For four strains (1.0%), additional tests were required to delineate the correct identification from a range of two or more possibilities; these included one Serratia liquefaciens (Serratia marcescens or Serratia liquefaciens), one Serratia rubidaea (Serratia rubidaea or Serratia odorifera), one Salmonella typhi (Leminorella richardii or Salmonella sp.) and one Yersinia enterocolitica (Yersinia frederiksenii, Yersinia intermedia, or Yersinia enterocolitica). Twelve strains (3.2%) were misidentified or yielded codes with no identification; these comprised one Citrobacter amalonaticus (no identification), three Enterobacter hormaechei (not in the RapID onE database; two Enterobacter amnigenus, one Enterobacter sp.), one Serratia liquefaciens (Enterobacter cloacae), one Serratia rubidaea (no identification), four Serratia fonticola (not in RapID onE database; two Enterobacter aerogenes, one Serratia marcescens, one not identified), one Proteus mirabilis (Proteus penneri), and one Proteus vulgaris (Providencia rustigianii). If the seven strains not included in the database had been excluded, correct identification rates would have risen to 97.6% without additional tests and 98.7% with additional tests, with misidentification rates dropping to 1.3%. The RapID onE system is easy to set up and the results are easy to read, and the system provides an accurate, nonautomated commercially available method for the same-day identification of members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and oxidase-negative, gram-negative nonfermenters.
TI  - Multipoint identification of Enterobacteriaceae: report of the British Society for Microbial Technology collaborative study.
AB  - AIMS: To evaluate the accuracy and reproducibility of multipoint identification schemes in a multicentre trial. METHODS: Forty two strains of Enterobacteriaceae were distributed to 22 laboratories for identification by routine multipoint methods. Analysis of results enabled inter- and intralaboratory reproducibility of a variety of tests, and the ability of laboratories to identify individual organisms to be determined. RESULTS: Interlaboratory reproducibility of most of the biochemical tests was acceptable. The least reproducible tests, both within and between laboratories, were citrate utilisation, production of urease and beta galactosidase, detection of motility, and decarboxylation of lysine and ornithine. Inconsistent results for these tests were often associated with misidentified strains. Most laboratories performed identifications satisfactorily. Most isolates (72.1%) were identified correctly to species level; 9.6% were incorrectly identified, and 6.4% could not be identified at all. The most difficult organisms to identify were Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Hafnia alvei and Aeromonas hydrophila. Strains of Enterobacter, Serratia sp, and Providencia sp were difficult to speciate. Several laboratories could not identify organisms exhibiting at least one atypical biochemical reaction. CONCLUSION: This study emphasises the need for quality control of media and reagents for multipoint identification of Gram negative enteric bacilli.
TI  - Resistance to third-generation cephalosporins in Barbados.
AB  - Resistance to third-generation, or extended-spectrum, cephalosporins caused by induction of class I beta-lactamases has been reported rarely from developing countries. Seven isolates of cephalosporin-resistant Gram-negative rods were recovered recently from urine, burns and ulcers in the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Barbados. The isolates were identified as Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (2), Citrobacter freundii (1), Enterobacter cloacae (1), Morganella morganii (1), Providencia stuartii (1) and Proteus sp. (1). Induction of beta-lactamase by cefoxitin was demonstrated, and minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were determined by agar dilution. beta-lactamases were demonstrated by isoelectric focusing; the presence of chromosomal beta-lactamases was confirmed in at least three of the resistant isolates. The only antibiotics which were uniformly active against these resistant strains were imipenem and ciprofloxacin. These data confirm the existence of resistance to the third-generation cephalosporins in Barbados, and emphasise the necessity for continuous surveillance of resistance patterns in the Caribbean region.
TI  - Piperacillin versus cefazolin given perioperatively to high-risk patients who undergo open cholecystectomy: a double-blind, randomized trial.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the efficacy, microbiologic features and toxicity of prophylactic cefazolin versus prophylactic piperacillin in high-risk patients who undergo open cholecystectomy. DESIGN: Double-blind randomized trial with follow-up for 6 weeks postoperatively. SETTING: An 850-bed community hospital, located in a major Canadian city. Patients admitted to hospital who satisfied published criteria for being at high-risk for infection after open cholecystectomy were entered into the protocol, and those who satisfied the criteria and provided consent were entered into the study. Eighty-one patients were randomly assigned by computer to receive either piperacillin or cefazolin as the prophylactic agent. INTERVENTIONS: Open cholecystectomy. MAIN OUTCOME: Provides detailed information on the organisms found in the biliary tree in patients with acute cholecystitis, assesses the in-vitro activity of cefazolin versus piperacillin against the isolated organisms, expecting that piperacillin would be much more active against isolated anaerobes and gram-negative bacteria. RESULTS: Bactobilia was documented in 42% of patients in the cefazolin group and 29% of patients in the piperacillin group. Piperacillin was active in vitro against 94% of all isolates versus 56% for cefazolin (p < 0.005, McNemar's test). Adverse effects and toxicities in both the piperacillin and cefazolin group were low and were not serious. CONCLUSIONS: Both piperacillin and cefazolin are safe and effective prophylactic antimicrobials for high-risk patients who undergo open cholecystectomy. However, piperacillin had a much wider spectrum of in-vitro activity against the isolated pathogens, especially Enterococcus sp., Enterobacter cloacae and the anaerobes.
TI  - Analysis of polar lipids from some representative enterobacteria, Plesiomonas and Acinetobacter by fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry.
AB  - Fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry (FAB-MS) was used to analyse lipid extracts of bacteria to assess its usefulness for analysing anionic phospholipids of potential chemotaxonomic value. The following micro-organisms were tested: Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp., Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae (2 strains), Escherichia coli (3 strains), Hafnia alvei, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Morganella morganii, Plesiomonas shigelloides, Proteus mirabilis (3 strains), Serratia liquefaciens and Serratia marcescens. Negative-ion spectra provide data for twenty-seven major carboxylate anions (m/z 209-325) and for thirty-seven major phospholipid anions (m/z 645-774). Generally, the largest carboxylate peaks were due to 16:1, 16:0, cyc17 and 18:1 while the largest phospholipid anion peaks were due to PE(32:1), PE(33:1), PE(34:1), PE(34:2), PG(30:2), PG(31:2), PG(32:2), PG(34:1) and PS(33:0). However, quantitative differences were observed. For example, Acinetobacter lacked PE (33:1) but had exceptionally high peaks at m/z 748, PS(33:0), and m/z 281, octadecanoate. Unknown 'carboxylate' peaks were detected at m/z 254, 256, 261, 268, 282 and 301. In some cases, unknown peaks appeared to constitute possible homologous series being separated by delta m/z of 14(identical to methylene). For chemotaxonomic purposes, the complexity of the data required numerical analysis. Using the Pearson coefficient of linear correlation, as a measure of association, it was possible to compare all strains analysed. Typical results for strain comparisons were as follows: Ent. cloacae vs Ent. cloacae, r = 0.90 (Ent. cloacae vs Ac. calcoaceticus, r = 0.46). Thus FAB-MS represents an excellent means of obtaining large quantities of data on polar lipids of a range of bacterial isolates, which may be suitable for chemotaxonomic purposes.
TI  - Cloacal flora isolated from wild black-bellied whistling ducks (Dendrocygna autumnalis) in Laguna La Nacha, Mexico.
AB  - Cloacal swabs from 110 adult black-bellied whistling ducks trapped at Laguna La Nacha, Tamaulipas, Mexico, were cultured to determine the prevalence of normal and potentially pathogenic bacteria. Twenty-five gram-negative enterobacteria and four gram-positive cocci were isolated. The most common isolates included Escherichia coli (54%), Staphylococcus spp. (29%), Streptococcus spp. (22%), Aeromonas hydrophila (15%) Enterobacter cloacae (14%), and Micrococcus sp. (14%). The implications of whistling ducks as possible reservoirs of pathogenic bacteria are discussed.
TI  - Epidemiological role of arthropods detectable in health facilities.
AB  - A total of 161 arthropod specimens were collected from 55 sites in a health care  facility during July and September 1990. Of the 116 bacterial isolates obtained from their body surfaces 6% were from parasites (mosquitoes), 59% from eusynanthropic arthropods (Tenebrionid beetles, flies, German cockroaches, wasps), 16% from hemisynanthropic arthropods (ants, spiders) and 19% from occasionally encountered insects (non-biting midges, moths, beetles). Most (88%) of the isolated bacteria were Gram-negative rods of the species E. coli, Enterobacter, Klebsiella, Citrobacter, Proteus, Serratia, Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter. Gram-positive cocci accounted for 13% of isolates and were primarily represented by coagulase-negative staphylococci. The highest isolation rates were from body surfaces of flies, German cockroaches, non-biting midges (Chironomids) and Tenebrionid beetles. About one third of all isolates were resistant to more than three antimicrobials using a standard disc diffusion assay. The presence of multiple resistance to antibiotics was observed in two thirds of Enterobacter isolates, namely those of Enterobacter cloacae from the body surface of Germany cockroaches, in 13% of Citrobacter spp and in 8% of Klebsiella spp as well as Acinetobacter calcoaceticus strains. Strains of Morganella and Hafnia species were very infrequent but all of them shared resistance to the antibiotics tested. In contrast, strains of Serratia spp were relatively antibiotic-sensitive. The group of isolated Gram-positive organisms was represented by two strains of Staphylococcus hominis and one strain of Enterococcus sp, all of them were multiply-resistant to antimicrobials.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological, and clinical studies on panipenem/betamipron in children].
AB  - Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies were performed on panipenem/betamipron (PAPM/BP) in children. The results are summarized as follow: 1. Twelve patients with various bacterial infectious diseases were treated with PAPM/BP. Each dose was 20 mg/20 mg/kg, administered 3 times daily, in 30-minute intravenous drip infusion. Treatments were continued for 5-22 days. Clinical efficacies of PAPM/BP in 12 patients with bacterial infections (1 with suspected sepsis, 5 with pneumonia, 1 with acute maxillary sinusitis, 2 with acute otitis media, 1 with cervical abscess and 2 with urinary tract infection complexed type) were evaluated as excellent in 7, good in 4 and fair in 1, with an efficacy rate of 91.7%. Seventeen causative organisms found in 10 patients (Haemophilus influenzae in 4, Branhamella catarrhalis in 3, Streptococcus pneumoniae in 2, Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 2, Staphylococcus aureus in 1, alpha-Streptococcus in 1, Corynebacterium sp. in 1, Peptostreptococcus micros in 1 and Klebsiella pneumoniae in 2) were eradicated except 2 strains (S. aureus and P. aeruginosa) from 1 patient (patient No. 2). No adverse reactions were observed in any of the 12 patients. 2. MICs of PAPM were examined against 22 clinical isolates (H. influenzae 5, B. catarrhalis 3, alpha-Streptococcus 3, S. pneumoniae 2, Corynebacterium sp. 2, S. aureus 1, P. aeruginosa 1, P. micros 1, Enterobacter cloacae 1, Escherichia coli 1, Group D Streptococcus 1 and Staphylococcus epidermidis 1) from children with bacterial infections. PAPM showed a good antibacterial activity comparable to the activity of cefoperazone (CPZ) against S. pneumoniae strains relatively tolerant to penicillins. However, the activity of PAPM against H. influenzae was somewhat weaker than that of CPZ. 3. Pharmacokinetic studies.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of sparfloxacin (AT 4140, RP 64206--SPFX) against 275 multiresistant clinical isolates.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of sparfloxacin was compared with that of pefloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, imipenem, ceftazidime, gentamicin and amikacin against 275 multiresistant nosocomial clinical isolates. They consisted of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (37), Enterobacter cloacae (42), Acinetobacter anitratus (60), Klebsiella pneumoniae (37) and Staphylococcus sp (99). Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC90) and geometric mean MICs for sparfloxacin were as follows (mg/l): P. aeruginosa 128-23.7, E. cloacae 1-0.13, A. anitratus 2-0.14, K. pneumoniae 1-0.08, MRSA 16-0.98, MSSA 0.12-0.03, MRSE 0.25-0.12 and MSSE 0.12-0.05. It is concluded that sparfloxacin was the most potent agent against staphylococci and A. anitratus including strains resistant to the other quinolones while ciprofloxacin was the most potent agent against P. aeruginosa, E. cloacae and K. pneumoniae.
TI  - [Desiccated rattlesnake capsules: a potential source of gram-negative bacterial infection].
AB  - The ingestion of rattlesnake powder capsules is frequent in Mexico in view of their alleged curative properties in various diseases, among them different malignancies. Based on previous reports showing both bacteremia and septicemia in patients with malignant diseases ingesting such capsules, we conducted a study to evaluate the presence of microorganisms in 16 different preparations of rattlesnake powder capsules, obtained in six different cities of our country. We found that all the samples were significantly contaminated with gram-negative coliform bacteria: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter agglomerans, E. cloacae, Salmonella arizona and Salmonella of groups B, E4 and G. Eighty one percent of the capsules were contaminated with Salmonella sp. The most frequent was S. arizona with a natural reservoir in snakes. Contamination was probably derived from both the flesh of the snake and fecal contamination during the domestic preparation of the powder to produce the capsules. These data, together with those previously published regarding bacteremia and septicemia derived from the ingestion of the capsules, suggests that there is danger in their use.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of microorganisms associated with the traditional  sorghum fermentation for production of sudanese kisra.
AB  - Sorghum flour obtained from Sudan was mixed with water in a 1:2 (wt/vol) ratio and fermented at 30 degrees C for 24 h. The bacterial populations increased with fermentation time and reached a plateau at approximately 18 h. At the end of 24 h, sorghum batter pH had dropped from 5.95 to 3.95 and the batter had a lactic acid content of 0.80%. The microbial population during the 24 h of fermentation consisted of bacteria (Pediococcus pentosaceus, Lactobacillus confusus, Lactobacillus brevis, Lactobacillus sp., Erwinia ananas, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterobacter cloacae), yeasts (Candida intermedia and Debaryomyces hansenii), and molds (Aspergillus sp., Penicillium sp., Fusarium sp., and Rhizopus sp.). P. pentosaceus was the dominant microorganism at the end of the 24-h fermentation. When three consecutive fermentations using an inoculum from the previous fermentation were carried out, the bacterial population increase plateaued at 9 h. The microbial populations in these fermentations were dominated by P. pentosaceus.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic and clinical studies on cefpirome in pediatrics].
AB  - Cefpirome (CPR, HR 810), a new parenteral cephalosporin antibiotic, was studied for its pharmacokinetics, bacteriological and clinical effects in the field of pediatrics. 1. CPR was very active against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Coagulase-negative staphylococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae among Gram-positive cocci. Antibacterial activities of CPR were also strong against Branhamella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Salmonella sp., Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa among Gram-negative rods. 2. The plasma concentration 15 minutes after a bolus intravenous injection of 20 mg/kg was 80.4 micrograms/ml, and the T 1/2 (beta) was 1.03 hours. Plasma concentrations after intravenous drip infusion over 30 minutes of 20 mg/kg and 25 mg/kg were 48.3 and 117 micrograms/ml at the end of infusion, and T 1/2 (beta) for these dosage were 1.14 and 1.45 hours. 3. The urinary recovery rates over 6 hours after administration were 45.2-63.9% for CPR. 4. Clinical efficacies of CPR were excellent in 31 patients and good in 30 patients with an efficacy rate of 98.4%. In bacteriological examinations, causative organisms were eradicated with an eradication rate of 95.7%. 5. As side effects, diarrhea was observed in 5 patients and loose stool in 1 patient with an incidence of 8.2%. Abnormal values were found in some patients in clinical laboratory tests for eosinophilia, thrombocytosis and an elevation of GOT, GPT and triglyceride. These findings indicate that CPR will be useful against bacterial infections in pediatrics.
TI  - In-vitro and in-vivo antimicrobial activities of a novel cephalosporin derivative, CP6162, possessing a dihydroxypyridone moiety at the C-3 side chain.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of a novel cephalosporin derivative, CP6162, possessing a dihydroxypyridone moiety at the C-3 side chain, was evaluated in vitro and in vivo, with ceftazidime, aztreonam and cefoperazone as the reference antibiotics. CP6162 showed weak or little activity against Gram-positive bacteria, but potent activity against clinical isolates of the Gram-negative species including strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Ps. cepacia, Acinetobacter sp., Xanthomonas maltophilia, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae and Citrobacter freundii, which were resistant to the reference antibiotics. The MICs of CP6162 were only slightly affected by the high producers of beta-lactamases except for cephalosporinase-producing C. freundii. It was, however, affected by the presence of ferric ion. CP6162 showed in-vivo activity paralleling the in-vitro activity, and also showed pharmacokinetic parameters similar to those of ceftazidime in mice and rats.
TI  - A randomized prospective study of ceftazidime and ciprofloxacin with or without teicoplanin as an empiric antibiotic regimen for febrile neutropenic patients.
AB  - Febrile neutropenic patients were randomized to receive ceftazidime and ciprofloxacin with the addition of teicoplanin in cases with clinical suspicion of a Hickman line-associated infection. At 48 h both clinical and bacteriological analyses were made. Patients were categorized as: success, in cases of improvement or stability in the clinical condition; failure, if there was a deterioration of the clinical condition; and non-evaluable, in cases of protocol violation or death due to other causes. A total of 86 patients have completed the study so far; 43 patients were randomized to the ceftazidime and 43 to the ciprofloxacin group. Teicoplanin was added to the monotherapy in 12 patients in the ceftazidime group and 15 in the ciprofloxacin group. The diagnoses were: acute myelogenous leukaemia (25), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (34), Hodgkin's disease (17); acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (9) and chronic granulocytic leukaemia (1). Forty-eight hour clinical assessment showed a response rate in the ceftazidime group of: success 18/31 (58%), failure 13/31 (42%); in the ceftazidime and teicoplanin group: success 8/12 (67%), failure 4/12 (33%); in the ciprofloxacin group: success 23/28 (82%), failure 5/28 (18%); and in the ciprofloxacin and teicoplanin group: success 11/15 (73%), failure 4/15 (27%). Blood cultures were positive in 48/86 (56%) cases, with more than one organism isolated in seven of these 48 cases. Organisms isolated were: coagulase-negative staphylococci (20), Escherichia coli (13), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4), Staphylococcus aureus (3), diphtheroids (3), Klebsiella sp. (3), Enterobacter cloacae (2), Streptococcus faecalis (2), Ent. adenocarboxylata (1), Clostridium septicum (1). Strept. B (1), alpha streptococcus (1) and P. fluorescens (1), In-vitro testing showed that all Gram-positive organisms were sensitive to teicoplanin, and Gram-negative organisms to ciprofloxacin or ceftazidime. There were seven cases of superimposed infections with eight organisms isolated, all cases occurring in patients receiving ciprofloxacin alone: coagulase-negative staphylococci (4), Strep. sangius (1), Strep. viridans (1), diphtheroids (1) and P. maltophilia (1). Both ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime are comparable in efficacy as empirical monotherapy for febrile neutropenic patients. There is, however, a significant increase in the incidence of superimposed infection in patients receiving only ciprofloxacin. In view of the very high incidence of Gram-positive septicaemia, we suggest that teicoplanin should be added as part of the initial empiric antibiotic regimen in all febrile neutropenic patients.
TI  - Cefotaxime and aminoglycoside treatment of meningitis caused by gram-negative enteric organisms.
AB  - We reviewed cases of Gram-negative enteric bacillary meningitis in infants and children treated with cefotaxime at Texas Children's Hospital from January, 1984, through June, 1989. Seventeen of 20 children had an underlying condition predisposing to the development of meningitis. The etiologic organisms in these 20 children (2 days to 12 years old; median, 12 days old) were Klebsiella sp, 9; Escherichia coli, 4; Enterobacter cloacae, 3; Citrobacter diversus, 2; other, 2. With the exception of one isolate of Acinetobacter, all isolates were susceptible to cefotaxime. In addition to cefotaxime 17 children received an aminoglycoside intravenously. Children with meningitis caused by Klebsiella sp. or non-Klebsiella organisms received cefotaxime for 31 +/- 14 and 37 +/- 17 days, respectively. Aminoglycosides were administered for 16 +/- 10 days in both groups. Five children in each group also received intraventricular doses (1 to 25) of an aminoglycoside (9) or colistimethate (1). The mean durations of positive lumbar, ventricular cerebrospinal fluid or brain abscess cultures were 5.8 +/- 4.7 and 7.2 +/- 5.0 days after start of therapy in the Klebsiella and non-Klebsiella meningitis patients, respectively. Only three children were normal at the time of discharge or follow-up. Gram-negative enteric meningitis remains difficult to treat despite the excellent in vitro activity of cefotaxime against Gram-negative enterics, in part as a result of the predisposing conditions resulting in the development of this infection.
TI  - Coupled reductive and oxidative degradation of 4-chloro-2-nitrophenol by a co-immobilized mixed culture system.
AB  - The restriction of oxygen transfer in Ca-alginate beads used for the immobilization of microbial cells was applied to a coupled reductive and oxidative microbial degradation of the xenobiotic 4-chloro-2-nitrophenol (CNP). The conversion of CNP by Enterobacter cloacae under anaerobic conditions led to the formation of 4-chloro-2-aminophenol (CAP, 81%) and 4-chloro-2-acetaminophenol (CAAP, 16%) after 50 h incubation. CAP, the main reduction product, was further degraded under aerobic conditions by Alcaligenes sp. TK-2, a hybrid strain isolated by conjugative in-vivo gene transfer. Whereas both degradation steps excluded one another in homogeneous systems with free cells, a coupled reductive and oxidative degradation of CNP was observed in one aerated reactor system after co-immobilization of both strains in Ca alginate. The diameter of the alginate beads used for immobilization was recognized as one main factor determining the properties of this mixed culture system.
TI  - Antibacterial activity in the hemolymph of myriapods (Arthropoda).
AB  - The hemolymphs of two diplopod (Chicobolus sp. and Rhapidostreptus virgator) and  two chilopod species (Lithobius forficatus and Scolopendra cingulata) were tested for the presence of antibacterial substances using Petri dish tests. The native hemolymph of all species had substances acting on living Micrococcus luteus, whereas only Rhapidostreptus, Scolopendra, and Lithobius were effective against lyophilized Micrococcus. The antibacterial activity against living Micrococcus increased after inoculation with bacteria (Enterobacter cloacae beta-12) in Chicobolus and Rhapidostreptus and also against lyophilized Micrococcus in the latter. Thus, these effects appear to be inducible. None of the myriapods tested had any bacteriostatic effect on Escherichia coli D-31 whereas the growth of gram-negative E. cloacae was inhibited. The antibacterial substances in the diplopod species were unstable when heated but were resistant to freezing. At least two antibacterial substances (a lysozyme-like one and another substance) are considered to occur in Myriapoda.
TI  - [Identification and classification of 204 strains of gram negative organisms isolated from poultry eggs].
AB  - Results of identification and classification of 204 strains of Gram negative bacteria isolated from poultry eggs are reported. Among 106 strains of glucose nonfermenting bacteria 105 (99%) strains could be further identified as: pseudomonas (87 strains), including P. fluorescens (63), P. putida (9), P. maltophilia (12), P. putrefaciens (2), and P. stutzeri (1); 2 strains of Alcaligenes, both identified as A. denitrificans; 7 strains of Flavobacterium, including F. multovorum (3) and Flavobacterium sp. (4); and 9 strains of Acinetobacter, including A. lwoffi (7) and A. anitratus (2). Among 98 strains of fermentors, 73 strains (74.5%) could be identified as; Escherichia (9), E. coli (12), Enterobacter Liquefaciens (31), Ent. cloacae (7), Ent. halfnia (8), Ent. aerogenes (1) and proteus (5); while 25 strains (25.5%) which split glucose and lactose or sucrose fermentative with acid but no gaseouse formation remain to be ascertained.
TI  - The effect of physical and microbiological factors on food container leakage.
AB  - The effect of physical and microbiological factors on food container leakage was  investigated in a container leakage model system (CLMS). The leakage of Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Staphylococcus sp., Pseudomonas sp., Bacillus sp., a coryneform, Staph. aureus, and two biotest organisms (Enterobacter cloacae NC1B 8151 and Ent. aerogenes MB31) was studied. The rate of bacterial leakage (log10 cells/channel/s) was greater in the presence of a partial vacuum of 51-305 mm Hg than at atmospheric pressure. Fluid flow (ml) through leakage channels was increased by the application of vacuum. Leakage varied with vacuum, bacterial morphology, cell concentration, leakage channel size (0.78-120 micron 2) and channel shape (straight or convoluted). The number of leaked cells was not proportional to vacuum or channel size. The effect of channel shape varied with bacterial species. Increased container medium viscosity decreased bacterial leakage. Fluid flow through leakage channels was generally reduced by the most viscous solution. Cells from biofilms and monolayers of Ac. calcoaceticus or Staph. aureus attached to nylon (Hyfax) or stainless steel surfaces underwent leakage. Mixed bacterial populations had characteristic leakage rates against vacuum different from the leakage pattern of individual species in the population. The composition of the leaked population was different from the original inoculum. The results indicated that container leakage is a complex process involving a range of interdependent factors.
TI  - Hemolysin as a marker for Serratia.
AB  - All Serratia marcescens strains (total of 33) of different sources were hemolytic including clinical strains previously classified as being nonhemolytic. DNA fragments of the two hemolysin genes hybridized with the chromosomal DNA of S. marcescens, S. liquefaciens, S. kiliensis, S. grimesii, S. proteamaculans, S. plymutica, S. rubridaea which were also hemolytic. The restriction pattern of the hemolysin locus differed in each strain. S. ficaria and S. marinorubra expressed a different hemolysin which was much smaller than the S. marcescens hemolysin since it diffused through dialysis membranes. The DNA of the latter strains did not hybridize with the S. marcescens hemolysin DNA probes. Some S. marcescens strains, S. kiliensis and S. liquefaciens also expressed in addition the small hemolysin. No hybridization was found with DNA of Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella arerogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Shigella dysenteriae, Yersinia enterocolitica, Yersinia pseudotuberculosus, Listeria sp., Aeromonas sp., Legionella sp. and a Meninococcus sp., indicating that the hemolysin DNA probes are specific for Serratia, or that the hemolysin genes occur rarely in genera other than Serratia.
TI  - Multicenter in vitro comparison of piperacillin and nine other antibacterials against 1,629 clinical isolates.
AB  - The antibacterial spectrum of activity of piperacillin was compared with that of  other antibiotics against isolates of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas cepacia, Pseudomonas maltophilia, Serratia marcescens, Enterococcus sp, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides bivius, and Clostridium difficile obtained from laboratories at hospitals in St. Louis, in Memphis, and in Newark, New Jersey. Of the 1,629 isolates tested, 91% were susceptible to piperacillin, 90% to mezlocillin, 87% to ticarcillin/clavulanate and imipenem, 83% to ceftazidime, 81% to cefoperazone, 80% to ciprofloxacin, 77% to ceftriaxone, 71% to aztreonam, and 51% to cefoxitin.
TI  - Evaluation of numerical analysis of SDS-PAGE of protein patterns for typing Enterobacter cloacae.
AB  - Twenty cultures comprising 13 clinical isolates of Enterobacter cloacae from two  hospitals, the type and another reference stain of E. cloacae and the type strains of four other Enterobacter sp. and of Escherichia coli, were characterized by one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) of whole-cell proteins. The protein patterns were highly reproducible and were used as the basis of a numerical analysis which divided the clinical isolates into nine clearly defined protein types. Comparison with established typing methods indicated that the discrimination of SDS-PAGE was similar to that achieved with conventional typing methods and all strain groups recognized by combined sero/phage typing were also found by SDS-PAGE. In addition, protein typing sub-divided a group of four serotype O3 isolates that were difficult to distinguish by phage typing. We conclude that high-resolution SDS-PAGE of proteins provides an effective method of typing isolates of E. cloacae.
TI  - [Susceptibility of clinical isolates to aztreonam].
AB  - In vitro antibacterial activities of 9 antibiotics including aztreonam (AZT) against clinically isolated Gram-negative bacteria were determined using MIC-2000 plus system. Bacteria were isolated from clinical materials in Saga Medical School during a period from May 1987 to March 1988. Summarized results were as follows: 1. AZT showed excellent antibacterial activities against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus sp. and Haemophilus influenzae, and MIC80 values of AZT against these organisms were lower than 0.20 microgram/ml. 2. Antibacterial activities of AZT were superior to cephem antibiotics compared against Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii and Serratia marcescens. 3. The MIC50 and MIC80 of AZT against Pseudomonas aeruginosa were 12.5 micrograms/ml and 25 micrograms/ml, respectively. 4. AZT did not show any antibacterial activity against Acinetobacter sp. and Xanthomonas maltophilia.
TI  - Product of the Lactococcus lactis gene required for malolactic fermentation is homologous to a family of positive regulators.
AB  - Malolactic fermentation is a secondary fermentation that many lactic acid bacteria can carry out when L-malate is present in the medium. The activation of the malolactic system in Lactococcus lactis is mediated by a locus we call mleR. Induction of the genes necessary to perform malolactic fermentation occurs only in bacteria with a functional copy of mleR. The mleR gene consists of one open reading frame capable of coding for a protein with a calculated molecular mass of 33,813 daltons. The amino acid sequence of the predicted MleR gene product is homologous to that of positive activators in gram-negative bacteria: LysR, IlvY gene products of Escherichia coli, MetR, CysB of Salmonella typhimurium, AmpR of Enterobacter cloacae, NodD of Rhizobium sp., and TrpI of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - In vitro activity of tigemonam against multiresistant nosocomial Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - Tigemonam, an oral monobactam that exhibits beta-lactamase stability similar to that of aztreonam, was tested in vitro against 240 species of Enterobacteriaceae (50 Escherichia coli, 48 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 52 Enterobacter cloacae, 32 Proteus mirabilis, 22 Proteus indole-positive [Providencia sp.], 24 Serratia sp., and 12 Citrobacter sp. All strains were resistant to ampicillin and first-generation cephalosporins. In addition, 77.4% were resistant to amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid, 46.8% to cefuroxime, 23.3% to ceftriaxone, 22.2% to aztreonam, 46.9% to cotrimoxazole, and 0.9% to norfloxacin. Tigemonam at a concentration of 4 micrograms/mL or less inhibited 72.7% of the strains with minimum inhibitory concentrations ranging from 0.03 or less to more than 512 micrograms/mL. The highest intrinsic activity was observed against Proteus sp. Tigemonam proved to be a bactericidal antibiotic. Cross-resistance was chiefly observed with aztreonam and ceftriaxone. It is concluded that tigemonam should play an important role in the treatment of nosocomial infections that do not require parenteral therapy and in the treatment of multiresistant community-acquired infections.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. A study mainly focused on ofloxacin (the second report). Reported by the Research Group for Testing ofloxacin Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - Susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (OFLX) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures throughout Japan between April, 1986 and March, 1987. The results were totalized with an emphasis mainly on OFLX and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. In this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. Similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to OFLX included Staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), Entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), Escherichia coli (4,097 strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), Enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), Enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), Citrobacter freundii (406 strains), Proteus mirabilis (613 strains), Morganella morganii (320 strains), Serratia marcescens (869 strains), Haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), Acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and Campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). Neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to OFLX was investigated with this species. As results, OFLX showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, E. aerogenes, C. freundii, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, H. influenzae, A. calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp., and C. jejuni. However, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. The following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: Streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), Streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), Enterococcus faecium (146 strains), Branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), Citrobacter diversus (128 strains), Klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), Proteus vulgaris (438 strains), Serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), Pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), Pseudomonas putida (154 strains), Xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), Vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), Bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of dactimicin in vitro compared with that of dibekacin, netilmicin, sisomicin and micronomicin.
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of dactimicin, a pseudo-disaccharide aminoglycoside antibiotic, was compared with those of dibekacin, netilmicin, sisomicin and micronomicin using clinical isolates of four Gram-positive and sixteen Gram-negative bacteria. Dactimicin was more active than the reference amino-glycosides against Serratia marcescens, especially gentamicin-resistant Serratia sp., Proteus vulgaris, P. rettgeri and Klebsiella oxytoca, but less active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and P. mirabilis. Dactimicin was equally active as the references excepting netilmicin against Gram-positive bacteria and some Gram-negative bacteria including Escherichia coli, K. pneumoniae, Morganella morganii, Haemophilus influenzae, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogens, E. cloacae, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and Campylobacter jejunii. Dactimicin was active against resistant strains possessing various aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes including AAC(3)-1, by which dactimicin was acetylated.
TI  - In vitro susceptibility of bacteria to a ticarcillin-clavulanic acid combination.
AB  - In vitro testing of bacterial susceptibility to a combination of ticarcillin and  clavulanic acid was done, using 406 aerobic gram-positive and gram-negative isolates (considered to be pathogens) cultured from equine and small animal specimens. A microdilution broth technique of susceptibility testing was performed, using trays with wells containing a range of doubling concentrations of dehydrated ticarcillin (range, 0.50 to 128 micrograms/ml) with fixed concentration of clavulanic acid (4 micrograms/ml). The following isolates of equine origin were (90%) susceptible to concentrations of ticarcillin and clavulanic acid combinations of less than or equal to 16 and 4 micrograms/ml, respectively: Staphylococcus aureus, S intermedius, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Ent agglomerans, Ent cloacae, Escherichia coli, Actinobacillus sp, Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis, Rhodococcus equi, Proteus vulgaris, and Bordetella bronchiseptica. Isolates of small animal origin (90%) susceptible to less than or equal to 16 and 4 micrograms of ticarcillinclavulanic/ml included S aureus, S intermedius, Ent aerogenes, Ent agglomerans, Pasteurella multocida, B bronchiseptica, Pr mirabilis, and Serratia sp.
TI  - Survival of coliforms and bacterial pathogens within protozoa during chlorination.
AB  - The susceptibility of coliform bacteria and bacterial pathogens to free chlorine  residuals was determined before and after incubation with amoebae and ciliate protozoa. Viability of bacteria was quantified to determine their resistance to free chlorine residuals when ingested by laboratory strains of Acanthamoeba castellanii and Tetrahymena pyriformis. Cocultures of bacteria and protozoa were incubated to facilitate ingestion of the bacteria and then were chlorinated, neutralized, and sonicated to release intracellular bacteria. Qualitative susceptibility of protozoan strains to free chlorine was also assessed. Protozoa were shown to survive and grow after exposure to levels of free chlorine residuals that killed free-living bacteria. Ingested coliforms Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter agglomerans, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Klebsiella oxytoca and bacterial pathogens Salmonella typhimurium, Yersinia enterocolitica, Shigella sonnei, Legionella gormanii, and Campylobacter jejuni had increased resistance to free chlorine residuals. Bacteria could be cultured from within treated protozoans well after the time required for 99% inactivation of free-living cells. All bacterial pathogens were greater than 50-fold more resistant to free chlorine when ingested by T. pyriformis. Escherichia coli ingested by a Cyclidium sp., a ciliate isolated from a drinking water reservoir, were also shown to be more resistant to free chlorine. The mechanism that increased resistance appeared to be survival within protozoan cells. This study indicates that bacteria can survive ingestion by protozoa. This bacterium-protozoan association provides bacteria with increased resistance to free chlorine residuals which can lead to persistence of bacteria in chlorine-treated water. We propose that resistance to digestion by predatory protozoa was an evolutionary precursor of pathogenicity in bacteria and that today it is a mechanism for survival of fastidious bacteria in dilute and inhospitable aquatic environments.
TI  - Clinical safety and efficacy of ofloxacin.
AB  - In this study we report about the efficacy and tolerability of ofloxacin in the treatment of 15 patients with severe and moderately severe infections including osteomyelitis (5), soft tissue infections (5), salmonellosis in AIDS patients (2), acute or chronic pulmonary infections (2) and mediastinitis (1). The following organisms were isolated in culture specimens: Staphylococcus aureus (4), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4), Staphylococcus epidermidis (3), Serratia marcescens (1), Escherichia coli (1), Aeromonas hydrophila (1), Klebsiella oxytoca (1), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1), Salmonella cholerae-suis (1), Salmonella sp. (1), Enterobacter cloacae (1). All isolates were sensitive to the drug. Of 5 cases with osteomyelitis, 2 were cured and 3 improved clinically (with bacteriological eradication of the pathogens). The best results were obtained in patients with soft tissue infections: 4 patients were cured and 1 improved. Two patients with salmonella bacteremia and AIDS experienced a recurrence 1 month and 2 months respectively after stopping therapy. The patient with mediastinitis was successfully treated. Improvement was recorded for 2 patients with bronchiectasis and exacerbation of chronic bronchitis. The drug was well tolerated, only one episode of mild nausea and vomiting was reported and did not require discontinuation of the therapy. The study indicates that ofloxacin is a safe and effective agent in the treatment of various infections.
TI  - Effect of pH, temperature, and growth conditions on the adhesion of a gliding bacterium and three nongliding bacteria to polystyrene.
AB  - The effect of growth rate, growth phase, pH, and temperature on the permanent adhesion of a glidingFlexibacter sp. and three nongliding bacteria,Pseudomonas fluorescens, Enterobacter cloacae, andChromobacterium sp., to polystyrene substrata was investigated. The permanent adhesion of the flexibacter appeared to be related to growth, as levels of adhesion increased with increased growth rate in continuous culture and declined rapidly with death phase in batch culture. With the three nongliding bacteria, there was no relationship between growth rate and levels of permanent adhesion. The permanent adhesion of the nongliding bacteria was maximum between pH 5.5 and pH 7 and between 20 and 30 degrees C, whereas the adhesion of the flexibacter progressively decreased with increasing temperature and pH. The effect of different nutrient conditions on the gliding motility of the flexibacter across agar was also investigated. Gliding motility was inhibited by increased nutrient concentration and was affected by carbon source. Inhibition appeared to be related to the accumulation of a viscous exopolymer. It is proposed that the differences in the permanent adhesion of the gliding and nongliding bacteria may be related to their adaptation to different ecological niches.
TI  - Lipid A precursor from Pseudomonas aeruginosa is completely acylated prior to addition of 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonate.
AB  - Inhibition of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) synthesis in Pseudomonas aeruginosa at the stage of incorporation of 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonate (KDO) caused accumulation of a lipid A precursor which contained all of the fatty acids present on the lipid A of mature LPS. The enzyme CTP:CMP-3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonate cytidylyltransferase (CMP-KDO synthetase) from P. aeruginosa is inhibited by the KDO analog alpha-C-[1,5-anhydro-8-amino-2,7,8-trideoxy-D-manno-octopyranosyl] carboxylate (I), and I is effectively delivered to P. aeruginosa following attachment by amide linkage to the carboxyl terminus of alanylalanine. Intracellular hydrolysis releases the free inhibitor (I) which then inhibits activation of KDO by CMP-KDO synthetase causing accumulation of lipid A precursor and subsequent growth stasis. The major lipid A precursor species accumulated was purified and found to contain glucosamine, phosphate, C12:O, 2OH-C12:O and 3OH-C10:0 (in ester linkage), and 3OH-C12:0 (in amide linkage) in molar ratios of 1:1:0.5:0.5:1:1. Analysis of precursor by fast atom bombardment mass spectroscopy yielded a major ion (M - H)- of mass 1616 and fragments which were consistent with the structure of lipid A from P. aeruginosa. In contrast, Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter sp., Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Enterobacter cloacae all accumulated underacylated lipid A precursors which only contained 3-OH-C14:0, glucosamine, and phosphate. This difference and species-specific patterns of major and minor precursor species show that early steps in the assembly of lipid A are similar, but not identical in enteric and nonenteric Gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. Focusing mainly on ofloxacin (first report). Reported by the Research Group for Testing Ofloxacin Susceptibility of Clinical Isolates].
AB  - Susceptibility tests were carried out on a variety of clinically isolated pathogens using the susceptibility disc method at 197 hospitals in Japan between May, 1985 through March, 1986. These tests were organized by the Research Group for Testing Ofloxacin Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates, and the results were statistically analyzed. This paper describes a comparison of susceptibilities of clinical isolates including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Serratia marcescens, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp. and Campylobacter jejuni to ofloxacin (OFLX) and conventional antibacterial drugs. The results obtained were summarized as follows. 1. OFLX showed strong antibacterial activity against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, E. aerogenes, E. cloacae, C. freundii, K. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, H. influenzae, A. calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp. and C. jejuni and only a few strains were resistant to OFLX. Moreover, OFLX has superior antibacterial activity against many species compared not only to norfloxacin but also to most of the conventional antibacterial drugs. 2. When studied by sampled materials such as sputum, urine, abscesses and otorrhea, OFLX occasionally showed different actions against the same species from different sources. Almost species from the urinary isolates were less sensitive than those from the sputum.
TI  - In vitro activity of two new aryl-fluoroquinolone antimicrobial agents, difloxacin (A-56619) and A-56620 compared to that of other antimicrobial agents.
AB  - The in vitro activity of difloxacin (A-56619) and A-56620, two new aryl-difluoroquinolones, was compared to that of other new quinolones and several parenteral and oral antimicrobial agents. A-56620 inhibited 90% of Enterobacteriaceae at less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, Staphylococcus aureus 0.25 micrograms/ml, hemolytic streptococci 2 micrograms/ml, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 2 micrograms/ml, Bacteroides sp. and Clostridium at 8 micrograms/ml. A-56620 was equal or 2-fold more active than norfloxacin and ofloxacin, and 2-8-fold less active than ciprofloxacin. Difloxacin had similar in vitro activity with many isolates but usually was 2-8-fold less active than A-56620. Both agents inhibited beta-lactamase positive Haemophilus influenzae (MIC 0.015 micrograms/ml) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (MK less than or equal to 0.008 micrograms/ml). Both agents were more active against streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae than norfloxacin, ofloxacin and enoxacin, but not more active than ciprofloxacin. They inhibited Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii and Serratia marcescens resistant to cephalosporins and methicillin-resistant S. aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Spontaneously resistant mutants were seen with Enterobacteriaceae, P. aeruginosa and S. aureus at a frequency similar to that found for other new quinolones. These agents show overall in vitro activity comparable to other quinolones in clinical trial or recently approved for clinical use.
TI  - [Bacterial infection agents in hospitalized patients].
AB  - During six months the pattern of microbial isolates has been analysed from 1492 urinary tract infections, from 1445 wound infections, from 451 bronchial secretions, from 3067 blood cultures, from 116 peritoneal swabs and from 39 cerebrospinal fluids. All the specimens investigated were taken from patients of surgical, neurosurgical, internal wards and two intensive care units. In total, the most frequent isolates were grampositive microorganisms like Staphylococus aureus, Straphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus sp. of different serotypes. Out of the Enterobacteriaceae Escherichia coli and Klebisella pneumoniae predominated followed by Enterobacter cloacae and indolnegative and -positive Proteus species. The over all isolation rate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in nosocomial infections was about 10%. In the last time Pseudomonas maltophilia will be isolated more frequently as well as occasional Streptococcus faecium and Corynebacterium JK. Dependent from the site of infection anaerobic bacteria like Bacteroides sp., Peptococcus- and Peptostreptococcus sp. are really important in the infectious diseases. The epidemiological data should be always transmitted to the infection control board. From there preventive measures must be induced.
TI  - Variability of the influence of physicochemical factors affecting bacterial adhesion to polystyrene substrata.
AB  - The role of electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions and solid and liquid surface tensions in the adhesion of four bacterial species (Pseudomonas fluorescens, Enterobacter cloacae, Chromobacterium sp., and Flexibacter sp.) to hydrophobic polystyrene petri dishes and to more hydrophilic polystyrene tissue culture dishes was investigated. The effect of electrostatic interactions was investigated by determining the effects of different electrolyte solutions on attachment to and of different electrolyte and pH solutions on detachment from the polystyrene substrate. The significance of solid and liquid surface tensions and hydrophobic interactions was investigated by measuring the effects of different surfactants (including a concentration series of dimethyl sulfoxide) on adhesion and detachment. Adhesion varied with bacterial species, substratum, and electrolyte type and concentration, with no apparent correlation between adhesion and electrolyte valence or concentration. The influence of different pH and detergent solutions on bacterial detachment also varied with species, substratum, pH, and detergent type; however, the greatest degree of detachment of all strains from the surfaces was produced by detergent treatment. The results suggest that adhesion cannot be attributed to any one type of adhesive interaction. There was some evidence for both electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions, but neither interaction could wholly account for the data.
TI  - Enterobacter asburiae sp. nov., a new species found in clinical specimens, and reassignment of Erwinia dissolvens and Erwinia nimipressuralis to the genus Enterobacter as Enterobacter dissolvens comb. nov. and Enterobacter nimipressuralis comb. nov.
AB  - Enterobacter asburiae sp. nov. is a new species that was formerly referred to as  Enteric Group 17 and that consists of 71 strains, 70 of which were isolated from humans. Enterobacter asburiae sp. nov. strains gave positive reactions in tests for methyl red, citrate utilization (Simmons and Christensen's), urea hydrolysis, L-ornithine decarboxylase, growth in KCN, acid and gas production from D-glucose, and acid production from L-arabinose, cellobiose, glycerol (negative in 1 to 2 days, positive in 3 to 7 days), lactose, D-mannitol, alpha-methyl-D-glucoside, salicin, D-sorbitol, sucrose, trehalose, and D-xylose. They gave negative reactions in the Voges-Proskauer test and in tests for indole, H2S production, phenylalanine, L-lysine decarboxylase, motility, gelatin, utilization of malonate, lipase, DNase, tyrosine clearing, acid production from adonitol, D-arabitol, dulcitol, erythritol, i(myo)-inositol, melibiose, and L-rhamnose. They gave variable reactions in tests for L-arginine dihydrolase (25% positive after 2 days) and acid production from raffinose (69% positive after 2 days). Thirty-four Enterobacter asburiae sp. nov. strains were tested for DNA relatedness by the hydroxyapatite method with 32PO4-labeled DNA from the designated type strain (1497-78, ATCC 35953). The strains were 69 to 100% related in 60 degrees C reactions and 63 to 100% related in 75 degrees C reactions. Divergence within related sequences was 0 to 2.5%. Relatedness of Enterobacter asburiae sp. nov. to 84 strains of members of the Enterobacteriaceae was 5 to 63%, with closest relatedness to strains of Enterobacter cloacae, Erwinia dissolvens, Enterobacter taylorae, Enterobacter agglomerans, Erwinia nimipressuralis, and Enterobacter gergoviae. All strains tested were susceptible to gentamicin and sulfdiazine, and most were susceptible to chloramphenicol, colistin, kanamycin, nalidixic acid, carbenicillin and streptomycin. All strains were resistant to ampicillan, cephalothin, and penicillin, and most were resistant or moderately resistant to tetracycline. Enterobacter asburiae sp. nov strains were isolated from a variety of human sources, most prevalent of which were urine (16 strains), respiratory sources (15 strains), stools (12 strains), wounds (11 strains), and blood (7 strains). The clinical significance of Enterobacter aburiae is not known. As a result of this and previous studies, proposals are made to transfer Erwinia dissolvens and Erwinia nimipressuralis to the genus Enterobacter as Enterobacter dissolvens comb. nov. and Enterobacter nimipressuralis comb. nov., respectively.
TI  - [Fundamental and clinical studies of imipenem/cilastatin sodium in the field of obstetrics and gynecology].
AB  - Fundamental and clinical studies of a new carbapenem antibiotic, imipenem/cilastatin sodium (MK-0787/MK-0791), were carried out to evaluate the drug in treating infections of the female genital organs. The following results were obtained: In 4 patients undergoing hysterectomy, the penetration of MK-0787 and MK-0791 into female genital organ tissues was studied following a 30-minute intravenous drip infusion of MK-0787/MK-0791 500 mg/500 mg. Plasma levels of MK-0787 and MK-0791 in cubital venous blood following the drip infusion peaked at 0 minute with values of 51.2 micrograms/ml and 61.9 micrograms/ml, respectively, then decreased to 1.9 micrograms/ml and 0.7 microgram/ml, respectively, at 201 minutes. MK-0787 penetrated readily to female genital organ tissues and levels of the drug exceeded 0.5 approximately 1.9 micrograms/g in various organ tissues at 201 minutes following an intravenous drip infusion of 500 mg/500 mg of MK-0787/MK-0791. Clinically, MK-0787/MK-0791 was used for the treatment of obstetrical and gynecological infections at a dosage of 500 mg/500 mg twice daily by intravenous drip infusion. Clinical effects of MK-0787/MK-0791 were analyzed in 22 patients, including 9 patients with intrauterine infections, 7 with intrapelvic infections, 5 with adnexitis, and 1 with an external genital infection. Excellent responses were seen in 5 patients (22.7%), good responses in 15 (68.2%), and poor responses in 2 (9.1%). The efficacy ratio was 90.9%. After the treatment, 15 out of 18 isolates were eradicated for an 83.3% eradication rate. All strains of S. epidermidis (2 strains), Eubacterium lentum (1 strain), Peptococcus sp. (1 strain), beta-Streptococcus (1 strain), Gram-positive rods (2 strains), Enterobacter cloacae (1 strain), Bacteroides bivius (1 strain), Pseudomonas sp. (1 strain), Pseudomonas cepacia (1 strain) and Gram-negative rods (1 strain) were eradicated by the MK-0787/MK-0791 treatment. The safety of the drug was analyzed in 22 patients, effects occurred in 3 (13.6%). Among those 3 patients, diarrhea occurred in 1 patient, rash in another and nausea and vomiting in yet another. One patient had an increased BUN after the MK-0787/MK-0791 treatment. In the other 21 patients, no abnormalities in creatinine, GOT, GPT, or T. Bil. values were observed. It may be concluded that MK-0787/MK-0791 is useful for the treatment of obstetrical and gynecological infections.
TI  - In vitro activity of aztreonam against gram negative bacteria from clinical specimens and its comparison with other commonly used antibiotics.
AB  - A total of 755 gram negative bacteria isolated from clinical specimens were tested against aztreonam by the disc agar diffusion test. The strains of bacteria used in this study consisted of Escherichia coli (314), Enterobacter aerogenes (30), E. agglomerans (7), E. cloacae, (39), Citrobacter diversus (9), C. freundii (13), Hafnia alvei (3), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (10), Klebsiella oxytoca (6), K. ozaenae (5), K. pneumoniae (107), Morganella morganii (3), Moraxella sp. (10), Pasteurella multocida (1), Proteus mirabilis (66), P. vulgaris (4), Providencia rettgeri (12), P. stuartii (5), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (85), P. fluorescens (2), P. maltophila (7), Salmonella sp. (1) and Serratia marcescens (17). In vitro activity against aztreonam was compared with amikacin, ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalosporin, cefoxitin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, nitrofurantoin, piperacillin, tetracycline, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim and tobramycin. Over 99% of E. coli and Enterobacter species were susceptible to aztreonam. All the 118 strains of Klebsiella, 87 strains of Proteus-Providencia and 17 strains of S. marcescens were also susceptible. Aztreonam also showed good activity against P. aeruginosa, inhibiting 90% of the 85 isolates tested.
TI  - In vitro activity of ciprofloxacin compared with other agents against recent hospital isolates.
AB  - Ciprofloxacin's in vitro activity was tested against 385 hospital isolates originating from three geographically distinct regions. Of all strains tested, only three (1 Acinetobacter sp. and 2 Pseudomonas aeruginosa) were ciprofloxacin resistant. Ciprofloxacin was more active against Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Acinetobacter sp., Proteus sp., Shigella sp. than gentamicin, mezlocillin and cefotaxime. It was more active than azlocillin and cefsulodin against P. aeruginosa. It was more active than cloxacillin and cefamandole against staphylococci. It was as active as cefotaxime against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter freundii and Serratia marcescens. Ciprofloxacin demonstrated similar activity in broth and solid agar. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC's) of all strains were similar to the minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBC's). Ciprofloxacin's MIC was not influenced by increase of the inoculum or addition of human serum and only slightly influenced by anaerobic conditions. Decrease of the medium pH increased the MIC substantially. Ciprofloxacin exhibited a rapid bactericidal effect and had only a minimal post-antibiotic effect. These favorable in vitro characteristics of ciprofloxacin warrant further studies.
TI  - Cefadroxil in the horse: pharmacokinetics and in vitro antibacterial activity.
AB  - Sodium cefadroxil was administered as a single intravenous dose (25 mg/kg) to six healthy adult mares. Plasma samples were collected over a 24-h period and cefadroxil concentrations were measured by microbiological assay. The pharmacokinetic behavior of the drug was appropriately described in terms of a one-compartment open model. Values for the major pharmacokinetic terms were: extrapolated initial plasma concentration = 59.2 +/- 15.0 micrograms/ml; half-life = 46 +/- 20 min; apparent volume of distribution = 462 +/- 191 ml/kg; and body clearance = 7.0 +/- 0.6 ml/min.kg. In a subsequent study, a suspension of cefadroxil monohydrate was administered intragastrically (25 mg/kg) to the same six horses. Plasma concentrations of the drug peaked at 1-2 h but, in general, absorption was both poor and inconsistent. The data were unsuitable for determination of cefadroxil bioavailability from this oral dosage form. Ninety-nine isolates of eleven bacterial species obtained from clinically ill horses were tested for susceptibility to cefadroxil. All strains of Streptococcus equi, Streptococcus zooepidemicus, coagulase-positive staphylococci, Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis and five out of six strains of Actinobacillus suis were highly susceptible to the drug (MIC less than 4 micrograms/ml). Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Salmonella sp. showed intermediate susceptibility (MIC 4-16 micrograms/ml), while all isolates of Corynebacterium (Rhodococcus) equi, Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa proved to be highly resistant to cefadroxil (MIC greater than 128 micrograms/ml).
TI  - [Enterobacter cloacae and E. aerogenes septicemia: emergence of resistant variants (derepressed cephalosporinase) during treatment with third-generation cephalosporins].
AB  - From three patients hospitalised in intensive care units with Enterobacter septicaemia (two cases with E. cloacae, and one with E. aerogenes), cefotaxime therapy, alone or in combination with an aminoglycoside, selected variants (R) with increased resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics. The cross-resistance extended to all the beta-lactam antibiotics tested, penicillins and cephalosporins, including third-generation cephalosporins. The crude extracts of uninduced cultures of R variants showed high beta-lactamase activity and of the cephalosporinase type. These variants were selected in vitro with a frequency of 10(-6) to 10(-7) and may result from a mutation involving the regulation of Enterobacter cephalosporinases, usually inducible. Data from the literature indicated that this new type of resistance is actually emerging and observed not only in Enterobacter sp. The problem of emergence of R variants exhibiting cross-resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics should be considered when third-generation cephalosporins are used.
TI  - Assessment of head-space gas-liquid chromatography for the rapid detection of growth in blood cultures.
AB  - Blood for transfusion was inoculated with between 10(0) and 10(2) colony-forming  units (CFU) per ml of each of 59 microbial isolates and added to cooked meat broth. At intervals up to 72 h incubation, the cultures were examined by conventional visual inspection and automated head-space gas-liquid chromatography (HS-GLC). Forty-six isolates including all those examined of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, S. faecalis, S. milleri, S. mitior, S. mitis, S. salivarius, S. sanguis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Serratia sp., Enterobacter cloacae, Bacterioides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, Candida albicans, C. krusei and Torulopsis glabrata, and three isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis, were detected by HS-GLC. HS-GLC failed to detect the growth of eleven isolates including all those of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. Haemophilus influenzae, Corynebacterium sp. and two isolates of S. epidermidis. The growth of all 59 isolates were detected by visual inspection. No significant difference was found between HS-GLC analysis and visual inspection in the speed of detection of bacterial isolates. All the yeast isolates were detected by HS-GLC after 24 h incubation, indicating that it may be possible to detect fungemias earlier by HS-GLC analysis than by other methods.
TI  - Susceptibility of equine bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents.
AB  - In vitro antimicrobic susceptibility patterns of commonly isolated aerobic gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial pathogens of equine origin were determined, using the agar-plate dilution method. All organisms were recent clinical isolates and included Corynebacterium (Rhodococcus) equi, Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis, (coagulase positive) Staphylococcus sp, Streptococcus equi, Streptococcus zooepidemicus, Actinobacillus sp, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella. In vitro susceptibility levels were outlined for 14 antimicrobics as follows: amikacin less than or equal to 4.0 micrograms/ml, ampicillin less than or equal to 1.0 microgram/ml, amoxicillin less than or equal to 1.0 microgram/ml, cefadroxil less than or equal to 8.0 micrograms/ml, chloramphenicol less than or equal to 8.0 micrograms/ml, erythromycin less than or equal to 1.0 microgram/ml, gentamicin less than or equal to 2.0 micrograms/ml, kanamycin less than or equal to 4.0 micrograms/ml, penicillin less than or equal to 1.0 microgram/ml, tetracycline less than or equal to 1.0 microgram/ml, sulfadimethoxine less than or equal to 10.0 micrograms/ml, ormetoprim/sulfadimethoxine less than or equal to 0.5/9.5 micrograms/ml, sulfadiazine less than or equal to 10.0 micrograms/ml, and trimethoprim/sulfadiazine less than or equal to 0.5/9.5 micrograms/ml.
TI  - [Sensitivity to fosfomycin of bacteria isolated at the Pitie-Salpetriere Hospital in 1982 and 1983].
AB  - Susceptibility of 16 056 strains isolated in 1982 and 1983 to fosfomycin (FOS) was tested with Mueller-Hinton medium and discs 50 micrograms FOS + 25 micrograms glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) (cutoff diameter 14 mm). For 3 411 strains, inhibition zone diameters were recorded. Almost all E. coli, Citrobacter, Salmonella and S. aureus were susceptible to FOS as well as 70% of Serratia, E. cloacae, P. mirabilis and 50% of Klebsiella and Enterobacter sp. Only 27% of P. aeruginosa, 20% of indole positive Proteus and 8% of Acinetobacter were sensitive to FOS. E. coli, Citrobacter and S. aureus seem to exhibit the highest susceptibilities to FOS. Sensitivity rates of E. cloacae, Serratia, P. aeruginosa, and especially Klebsiella seemed slightly underestimated by the disk diffusion method, but differentiation between susceptible and resistant strains was facilitated by rating as susceptible those strains with inhibition zone diameters between 12 and 14 mm. This method also seemed to underrate the sensitivity of susceptible Enterobacteriaceae, probably because of inadequate G6P concentrations at this point of the disk.
TI  - Carbohydrate-binding sites of the mannose-specific fimbrial lectins of enterobacteria.
AB  - The combining sites of type 1 fimbrial lectins of various species of enterobacteria were studied by measuring the inhibitory activity of linear and branched oligosaccharides and several glycosides of D-mannose on the agglutination of yeast cells by the organisms. The results showed that all five strains of Escherichia coli tested possessed an elongated combining site best fitting a trisaccharide and including a hydrophobic region. Similar results were obtained with Klebsiella pneumoniae. Within the Salmonella genus, the combining sites of the six species tested were similar, but all differed significantly from those of the E. coli strains. The combining sites of Enterobacter cloacae and Enterobacter agglomerans were different from each other and from those of Salmonella sp. and E. coli. The results suggest that although classified under the general term "mannose-specific," bacterial lectins in the form of type 1 fimbriae on different genera exhibit differences in sugar specificities.
TI  - Bacterial interference with coliform colony sheen production on membrane filters.
AB  - The membrane filter (MF) method for detection and enumeration of coliform bacteria in drinking water requires that the coliforms both grow and produce a green metallic sheen when the filter is incubated on modified Endo medium at 35 degrees C for 22 h. Large numbers of noncoliform bacteria, which are enumerated by the standard plate count (SPC) technique, can interfere with the detection of coliforms on MF. This paper presents quantitative evidence from laboratory experiments on the interference of specific SPC bacteria on coliform colony sheen production on MF. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Aeromonas hydrophila caused significant reductions in Escherichia coli sheen colony counts when present at 3,000 and 220 per filter, respectively. The Flavobacterium sp. and Bacillus sp. selected for this study from SPC did not interfere with coliform colony sheen production. Excessive crowding of E. coli and Enterobacter cloacae colonies on MF also caused a reduction in the number of colonies that produced sheen. Even when there was no crowding (14 colonies per filter), only a fraction of the E. cloacae colonies produced sheen colonies on modified Endo medium.
TI  - Two new monobactam antibiotics produced by a Flexibacter sp. I. Taxonomy, fermentation, isolation and biological properties.
AB  - Two new beta-lactam antibiotics, namely SQ 28,502 and SQ 28,503, have been isolated from fermentations of a Flexibacter sp. They are demethoxy monobactams with oligopeptide side chains and have molecular weights of 1,462 and 1,446, respectively. These beta-lactams show a high degree of stability to a variety of beta-lactamases and act as potent irreversible inactivators of P99 beta-lactamase from Enterobacter cloacae. They exhibit weak antibacterial activity.
TI  - Superinfections in herpes simplex keratitis.
AB  - We reviewed 15 cases of culture-proven corneal superinfections in 15 patients (eight men and seven women ranging in age from 41 to 86 years) with recurrent herpes simplex keratitis. The factors that appeared to increase the risk of superinfection were the presence of an epithelial defect (found in all 15 cases), a history of recurrent herpetic keratouveitis (found in ten cases), and the use of topical corticosteroids (found in 13 cases). Eight of the 15 patients were taking antibiotics at the time the superinfections were diagnosed, indicating that topical antibiotics do not provide sufficient protection. Gram-negative rods were found in six cases (Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, and Achromobacter sp.). Gram-positive organisms, often in association with another infecting agent, were found in six cases (Staphylococcus epidermidis, three cases; S. aureus, two cases; and Streptococcus sp., two cases). Fungal superinfections were found in three cases (Cephalosporium acremonium, Candida albicans, and Aspergillus fumigatus, one case each). Mycobacterium cheloni was found in two cases.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of aztreonam: a synthetic monobactam. A comparative study  with thirteen other antibiotics.
AB  - The in vitro activity of aztreoman (SQ 26, 776), a new monocyclic beta-lactam antimicrobial agent, was determined against 1720 bacteria, all clinical isolates, and compared with that of thirteen beta-lactam and aminoglycoside antibiotics. Aztreonam inhibited 90% of Citrobacter diversus, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter agglomerans, E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus morganii, Proteus rettgeri, Proteus vulgaris and Salmonella sp. by less than or equal to 0.4 micrograms ml-1. This activity was superior to moxalactam, piperacillin, cefamandole, cefoperazone, cefoxitin, cefsulodin, ceftazidime and aminoglycoside antibiotics. Aztreonam was as active as moxalactam against Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae and Shigella species. Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains resistant to moxalactam, piperacillin, cefamandole, cefoperazone, cefotaxime, cefoxitin, cefsulodin and ceftazidime were inhibited by aztreonam 50% by 6.3 micrograms ml-1 and 90% by 16 micrograms ml-1. Aztreonam was as active as ceftazidime against Serratia marcescens, all strains were inhibited by 3.1 micrograms ml-1 and 90% by 1.6 micrograms ml-1. There was no major difference between MBC and MIC values of aztreonam and the effect of inoculum size upon MIC values was observed at 10(7) CFU.
TI  - Direct dilution sampling, quantitation, and microbial assessment of open-system ventilation circuits in intensive care units.
AB  - In a systematic approach, 37 duplicate samples of open system circuits (Bennett MA-1 ventilators) of patients in medical and surgical intensive care units were processed by direct and serial (APHA guidelines) dilutions. The paired difference test on 15 of the in-use circuitry solution samples indicated no difference between the direct and serial dilution methods (P less than 0.001). Seventy-seven additional respiratory therapy circuitry samples from similar intensive care patients were analyzed via a direct dilution method alone and processed microbiologically. The direct dilution procedure was a rapid and accurate means of evaluation of microbial contamination in the range of greater than or equal to 10 to less than or equal to 10(6) CFU/ml. High densities of organisms frequently were found. Sites of contamination included the proximal or patient end of the circuitry (heaviest), the nebulizer trap, and the distal or humidifier portions of the circuitry. The contaminants found were predominantly gram-negative nonfermenters: Acinetobacter calcoaceticus var. antitratus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas maltophilia, and Flavobacterium meningosepticum. Fermenters were Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus sp., Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter diversus, and Enterobacter agglomerans. Infrequently, gram-positive Streptococcus spp. and Staphylococcus spp. were noted.
TI  - 6-Acetylmethylenepenicillanic acid (Ro 15-1903), a potent beta-lactamase inhibitor. II. Antibacterial properties.
AB  - The beta-lactamase inhibitor Ro 15-1903 showed low affinity for penicillin binding proteins (PBPs) of Escherichia coli. When used as a single compound, it displayed no substantial antibacterial activity but in combination with ampicillin, it was similar to clavulanic acid in conferring activity against ampicillin-resistant strains. Some synergy between Ro 15-1903 and piperacillin was found against high inocula of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Ro 15-1903 markedly enhanced the activity of ceftriaxone against Bacteroides fragilis. In keeping with the in vitro findings, the combination Ro 15-1903 and ampicillin protected mice against systemic infections with beta-lactamase-producing strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus sp. but not against those with Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, and E. coli producing either chromosomally mediated beta-lactamase of type I or plasmid-mediated beta-lactamase of type TEM.
TI  - In vitro activity of norfloxacin, a quinolinecarboxylic acid, compared with that  of beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, and trimethoprim.
AB  - Norfloxacin is a quinolinecarboxylic acid compound. We examined the in vitro activity of this compound against gram-positive and -negative species, including anaerobic species. It inhibited 90% (MIC90) of strains of Escherichia coli at 0.05 microgram/ml, Klebsiella sp. at 0.4 microgram/ml, Salmonella and Shigella spp. at 0.1 microgram/ml, Citrobacter sp. at 0.4 microgram/ml, Enterobacter cloacae at 0.2 microgram/ml, Enterobacter aerogenes at 0.4 microgram/ml, and Enterobacter agglomerans at 0.2 microgram/ml. The MICs of Proteus mirabilis, Morganella sp., Proteus vulgaris, Proteus rettgeri, and Providencia sp. were 0.1, 0.2, 0.8, 0.3, and 1.6 micrograms/ml, respectively. The MIC90 of Serratia sp. was 1.6 micrograms/ml, and that of Acinetobacter sp. was 6.3 micrograms/ml. For Pseudomonas aeruginosa the MIC50, the MIC75, and the MIC90 were 0.8, 1.6, and 3.1 micrograms/ml, respectively. The MIC50 of Pseudomonas maltophilia was 3.1 micrograms/ml, and the MIC90 was 12.5 micrograms/ml. Yersinia, Arizona, and Aeromonas all were inhibited at concentrations below 1 microgram/ml, as was Campylobacter. The activity of the compound against gram-positive species was less impressive: the MIC90s of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus faecalis were 1.6, 6.3, 3.1, and 12.5 micrograms/ml, respectively. All Listeria strains were inhibited by 3.1 micrograms/ml. The activity of norfloxacine was not affected by the type of medium, pH, or inoculum size. There was no major difference between MIC and minimum bactericidal concentration values. Norfloxacin inhibited bacteria in every species which was resistant to ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalexin, gentamicin, and trimethoprim at concentrations lower than those of aminothiazolyl cephalosporins, moxalactam, and aminoglycosides.
TI  - [Laboratory and clinical studies of 6059-S in pediatric field (author's transl)].
AB  - The authors have carried out the laboratory and clinical studies of 6059-S. The results were as follows: The sensitivity was estimated by the plate dilution method on 27 strains of S. aureus, 26 strains of E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa, 21 strains of Salmonella sp. and 9 strains of GM resistant P. aeruginosa isolated from patients. The distribution of sensitivity of S. aureus was 6.25-12.5 micrograms/ml and the peak of distribution was 6.25 micrograms/ml. The growth of 80.8% of E. coli was inhibited at concentration of less than 0.1 microgram/ml. The growth of 88.5% of K. pneumoniae was inhibited at concentration of less than 0.2 microgram/ml. The growth of 81.0% of Salmonella sp. was inhibited at concentration of less than 1.56 microgram/ml. The distribution of sensitivity of P. aeruginosa was 12.5- greater than 100 micrograms/ml and the peak of distribution was 25.0 micrograms/ml. The distribution of sensitivity of GM-resistance P. aeruginosa (greater than or equal to 25 micrograms/ml) was 12.5-50 microgram/ml and 5 of 8 strains were inhibited at concentration of less than 25 micrograms/ml. Phagocytosis was determined by Quie's method. Phagocytosis of E. coli, K. pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris and Enterobacter cloacae by human polymorphonuclear neutrophil was more enhanced in the presence of 1 MIC and 1/2 MIC for 6059-S than for cefazolin at 4 and 6 hours after incubation. But phagocytosis of S. aureus did not enhanced in the presence of 6059-S. 6059-S was given by intravenous administration for 5 minutes and drip infusion for one hour at a single dose of 10 mg/kg of 6059-S to 3 and 4 children respectively. After intravenous administration of 6059-S, the mean peak serum level was 76.0 +/- 2.0 micrograms/ml at 15 minutes, 36.0 +/- 2.8 micrograms/ml at one hour, 1.5 +/- 0.4 micrograms/ml at 6 hours respectively. Half-life time was 1.3 hours. And after drip infusion of 6059-S was 39.9 +/- 9.7 micrograms/ml at one hour, 11.7 +/- 4.8 micrograms/ml at 3 hours and 1.8 +/- 1.4 micrograms/ml at 7 hours respectively. Half-life time was 1.4 hours. The mean urinary excretion rate was 90.4 +/- 6.1%, 76.5 +/- 16.0% up to 6 hours after intravenous administration and drip infusion respectively. 6059-S was effective in 17 cases out of 18 cases with bacterial infections. No side effects were observed except for 4 cases with elevation of serum transaminase, each on case of eosinophilia and of anemia.
TI  - Dinitrogen-fixing bacteria: computer-assisted identification of soil isolates.
AB  - Dinitrogen-fixing (acetylene-reducing) bacteria may be readily isolated from soils but extensive biochemical or immunobiological testing, or both, are required to identify them absolutely. A computer-assisted scheme for identification of nine genera of dinitrogen-fixing bacteria was developed and tested. The computer program is based on interpretation of the 70 biochemical tests of the API 20E and 50E, supplemented with tests for acetylene reduction, nitrate and nitrite reduction, catalase, oxidase, motility, and growth on MacConkey's bile salt medium. Dinitrogen-fixing Enterobacteriaceae (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, and Erwinia herbicola) were accurately identified using the data base in the API analytical profile index. Nonenteric dinitrogen-fixing bacteria (Azotobacter spp., Azospirillum spp., Derxia sp., Rhodospirillum sp., Clostridium sp., and Bacillus spp.) were subjected to these tests to form a new data base for these bacteria. The API tests agreed with standard biochemical tests commonly used to identify these bacteria, were reproducible with time, and were sufficiently unique to permit accurate identification of each species. The use of the API 20E and 50E tests plus the additional seven tests with these known data bases permitted rapid and precise identification of acetylene reducing bacteria from various agricultural ecosystems.
TI  - Association of human enteric pathogenicity and mouse lung toxicity of Escherichia coli.
AB  - Mouse lung toxicity of 439 strains (431 Escherichia coli, 1 Shigella dysenteriae  1, 1 Enterobacter cloacae, 5 Vibrio sp., 1 Klebsiella) was compared to other pathogenicity tests (mouse virulence, enterotoxicity, guinea pig eye test), to serogroup distribution, loss of virulence on storage, origin and haemolytic activity. Mouse lethality was highest in serogroup O4 (p < 0.001), O18a,c (p < 0.001); serogroups O6, O20, O75, O115, O147 were next in order. E. coli serogroups O19, O26, O28a,b, O32, O51, O53, O55, O73, O78, O79, O83, O105, O111, O112, O114, O117, O119, O124, O129, O136, O142 failed to show lung toxicity. Strains O4 and O18 isolated at different periods of time did not differ significantly in the lung test (p = 0.05, p = 0.01, p > 0.1, p = 0.05, p > 0.1). There was no significant difference between strains isolated from the stools of patients with enteritis and of healthy individuals (p = 0.1, p > 0.99) and between those isolated from all faecal specimens and from extraintestinal samples (p = 0.05, p > 0.3). There was no correlation between lung toxicity and other pathogenicity tests. Since strains isolated from healthy individuals were also toxic for mice, a positive lung test cannot be considered a criterion of the aetiological role of the agent.
TI  - Clinical study of the use of the new aminoglycoside tobramycin for therapy of infections due to gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Tobramycin, a new aminoglycoside antimicrobial, was evaluated as therapy for infections due to Gram-negative bacilli in 15 seriously ill patients with underlying diseases. Three of 10 patients with Gram-negative bacteraemia also had a urinary tract infection. Two patients had a respiratory tract infection, one had cellulitis, one had a urinary tract infection, and another had septic phlebitis. Twelve patients were cured of their infections. Eosinophilia was observed in one patient, and another developed superinfection with Staphylococcus aureus after 6 days of tobramycin therapy. There were five isolates of Escherichia coli, five of Klebsiella sp., two of Pseudomonas sp., and one each of Enterobacter agglomerans, Serratia marcescens and Enterobacter cloacae. The average serum concentration of tobramycin 2 hr after a parenteral dose of 1.0 to 1.5 mg/kg was 5.1 microgram/ml; higher concentrations of tobramycin were present in urine. Tobramycin proved to be an effective antimicrobial in these patients.
TI  - [Kinetics of setting up of a human fecal flora in germ free mice and trial of decontamination of antibiotherapy (author's transl)].
AB  - We have tried in this study to reproduce in germfree mice a bacterial equilibrium observed previously in the gastrointestinal tract of child "L.N.", reared in a plastic isolator. Eight bacterial strains were studied. Seven had been fortuitously introduced: Acinetobacter lwoffi LN1, Staphylococcus epidermidis LN2, Clostridium perfringens LN3, Plectridium anatum LN4, Streptococcus bovis LN5, Enterobacter cloacae LN6, Corynebacterium sp LN7. The eighth strain was purposely administered to the child in order to take advantage of an antagonism between this strain and spontaneously acquired flora. This strain is Bacillus licheniformis FD1. The gnotoxenic mice proved to be a good experimental model because we found their bacterial equilibrium comparable to that observed in child L.N. In addition, we studied the decontamination procedures of the gastrointestinal tract of mice by observing both the antagonism of B. licheniformis with bacitracin, and the action of a suitable mixture of antibiotics. Conditions for the realization of this decontamination are discussed in this study.

There were five isolates of Escherichia coli, five of Klebsiella sp., two of Pseudomonas sp., and one each of Enterobacter agglomerans, Serratia marcescens, and Enterobacter cloacae. The average serum concentration of tobramycin 2 h after a parenteral dose of 1.0 to 1.5 mg/kg was 5.1 mug/ml; higher concentrations of tobramycin were present in urine. Tobramycin proved to be an effective antimicrobial in these patients.
TI  - Effect of coliform and Proteus bacteria on growth of Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Cultures of coliform and Proteus bacteria, mostly from foods, were tested for their effect on growth of Staphylococcus aureus in Trypticase Soy Broth. Inhibition of the staphylococcus by these competitors increased with increasing proportions of inhibiting (effector) bacteria in the inoculum and decreasing incubation temperatures (37 to 10 C). Time required for 2 x 10(4) staphylococci to increase to 5 x 10(6) cells per milliliter, the minimal number assumed to be necessary for food poisoning, varied with the species of effector, the original ratio of effector bacteria to staphylococci in the medium, and the incubation temperature. When the original ratio was 100:1, the staphylococci did not reach 5 x 10(6) cells per milliliter at 10, 15, 22, or 30 C (with one exception), when growing with cultures representing six species of coliform bacteria and two of Proteus. When the ratio was 1:1, all effectors either greatly delayed the staphylococcus or prevented it from reaching hazardous numbers at 15 C, six of the eight caused a delay of 2 to 3 hr at 22 C, and only Escherichia coli delayed the coccus at 30 C. All effectors were ineffective at 22 and 30 C when original numbers of effectors and staphylococci were in the ratio 1:100. Greatest overall inhibition was by E. coli, E. freundii, and Proteus vulgaris, and these species were more effective than the others at 22 and 30 C. Aerobacter cloacae and Paracolobactrum aerogenoides were more effective at 15 C. In general, results were similar with different strains of a species. Except for Aerobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella sp., and P. aerogenoides, which apparently did not compete for nutrients, inhibition of the staphylococcus was by a combination of antibiotic substances and competition for nutrients.
