TI  == prevotella dentasini sp. nov., a black-pigmented species isolated from the oral cavity of donkeys.
AB  == four strains (num 1903(t), num 1904, num 1912 and num 1925) that were obligately  anaerobic, pigmented, gram-negative-staining rods were isolated from the oral cavity of donkeys. these strains were analysed using the rapid id 32a, api 20a and api zym systems, by dna-dna hybridization with other related species and by 16s rrna gene sequencing. 16s rrna gene sequence analysis showed that each of the new isolates was a member of the genus prevotella and related to prevotella multiformis pppa21(t), showing about 93 % sequence similarity. based on phylogenetic and phenotypic evidence, it is proposed that the four strains are representatives of a novel species, for which the name prevotella dentasini sp. nov. is proposed. the type strain is num 1903(t) (=jcm 15908(t)=dsm 22229(t)).

TI  == prevotella multiformis sp. nov., isolated from human subgingival plaque.
AB  == four bacterial strains isolated from the human oral cavity, pppa19, pppa21(t), pppa28 and pppa30, were characterized by determining phenotypic and biochemical features, cellular fatty acid profiles and the phylogenetic position based on 16s rrna gene sequence analysis. 16s rrna gene sequence analysis showed that each of  the isolates was a member of the genus prevotella. these strains were related to  prevotella denticola with about 95 % similarity. the strains were obligately anaerobic, non-pigmented, non-spore-forming, non-motile, gram-negative rods. however, the cells of these strains were often cocci (coccobacilli), depending on the cultivation time. colonies of different sizes were detected on eggerth gagnon agar plates for these strains. the cells forming large colonies were cocci, whereas those forming small colonies were cocci and rods. however, 16s rrna gene  sequence comparison of colonies of different sizes revealed that only a single organism was present. although these strains had phenotypic characteristics that  were similar to those of p. denticola jcm 8528, they could be differentiated from p. denticola jcm 8528 by aesculin hydrolysis and d-cellobiose fermentation in api 20a tests. dna-dna hybridization experiments revealed the genomic distinction of  these four strains with respect to p. denticola jcm 8528. on the basis of these data, a novel prevotella species, prevotella multiformis sp. nov., is proposed, with pppa21(t) (=jcm 12541(t)=dsm 16608(t)) as the type strain.
