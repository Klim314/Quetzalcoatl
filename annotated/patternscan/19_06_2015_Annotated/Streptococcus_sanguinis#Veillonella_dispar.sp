TI  == the influence of oral veillonella species on biofilms formed by streptococcus species.
AB  == oral veillonella, veillonella atypica, veillonella denticariosi, veillonella dispar, veillonella parvula, veillonella rogosae, and veillonella tobetsuensis are known as early colonizers in oral biofilm formation. to investigate the role  of oral veillonella, biofilms formed by the co-culture of streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, or streptococcus sanguinis, with  oral veillonella were examined at the species level. the amount of biofilm formed by s. mutans, s. gordonii, and s. salivarius in the presence of the six veillonella species was greater than that formed in the control experiments, with the exception of s. mutans with v. dispar. in contrast, in the case of biofilm formation by s. sanguinis, the presence of veillonella species reduced the amount of the biofilm, with the exception of v. parvula and v. dispar. the time-dependent changes in the amount of biofilm and the number of planktonic cells were grouped into four patterns over the 24 combinations. only that of s. gordonii with v. tobetsuensis showed a unique pattern. these results indicate that the mode of action of this combination differed from that of the other combinations with respect to biofilm formation. it is possible that there may be  several factors involved in the interaction between streptococcus and veillonella species.

TI  == selection for high-level resistance by chronic triclosan exposure is not universal.
AB  == objectives: to investigate the effect of triclosan exposure on the antimicrobial  susceptibilities of numerically important dental bacteria. methods: a gradient plate technique was used to expose fusobacterium nucleatum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, neisseria subflava, porphyromonas gingivalis, actinomyces naeslundii,  prevotella nigrescens, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans and veillonella dispar repeatedly to escalating, sublethal concentrations  of triclosan. escherichia coli atcc 8739 was included as an organism showing the  triclosan resistance development trait. mic values towards chlorhexidine, metronidazole and tetracycline were determined before and after biocide exposure. results: n. subflava, pr. nigrescens po. gingivalis and e. coli were highly susceptible to triclosan (mic range 0.1-3.9 mg/l), whereas the lactobacillus and  s. mutans were less susceptible (mic range 15.6-20.8 mg/l). triclosan exposure resulted in a highly significant ( approximately 400-fold) reduction in triclosan susceptibility (p < 0.01) for the positive control e. coli, although its mics towards chlorhexidine, metronidazole and tetracycline were not significantly altered. minor ( approximately two-fold) decreases in triclosan susceptibility (mic) occurred for pr. nigrescens and in s. sanguis and s. oralis (mbc). mean changes in susceptibilities (mic and mbc) of the oral species to chlorhexidine, metronidazole and tetracycline did not exceed two-fold, although chlorhexidine mbcs for s. sanguis were markedly, but transiently, increased. conclusions: these data fail to demonstrate biologically significant drug resistance in triclosan-exposed bacteria and suggest that markedly decreased triclosan susceptibility, although confirmed for e. coli, is not a universal phenomenon. other bacteria possibly possess more susceptible targets than fabi that are highly conserved, which may govern triclosan activity.

TI  == effects of glucose and fluoride on competition and metabolism within in vitro dental bacterial communities and biofilms.
AB  == antimicrobial effects of fluoride in vivo remain contentious. previous studies suggested that 1 mm naf reduced acid production from glucose, and prevented the enrichment of bacteria associated with caries in a chemostat model. the present study examines the effects of a lower fluoride concentration (0.53 mm, 10 ppm naf) in both biofilm and planktonic microbial communities. nine oral species were grown at ph 7.0 and pulsed on 10 successive days with glucose; bacterial metabolism was allowed to reduce the ph for 6 h before being returned to neutrality, either in the presence or absence of naf. in addition, 10-day-old mixed culture biofilms were overlaid with glucose, with or without naf, and the ph change followed by microelectrode. after 10 days, chemostat ph dropped to ca.  ph 4.5 following glucose pulses, and the community was dominated by streptococcus mutans (rising from 4 to 23% of total cfu) and veillonella dispar (16 to 73%). in comparison, after 10 days pulsing with glucose + fluoride, the final ph was significantly higher (ca. ph 4.9) (paired t test, p < 0.0001). the culture was predominated by v. dispar (70%) and actinomyces naeslundii (13%), whereas s. mutans proportions were significantly lower (t test, p = 0.04), remaining <3% of  the total flora, compared to the culture without fluoride. biofilm ph fell to only ph 5.55 1 h after glucose/fluoride overlay, compared to 4.55 with glucose alone (paired t test, p < 0.000001). analysis of the data suggests that fluoride  exerts dual antimicrobial modes of action. fluoride prevents enrichment of s. mutans by inhibiting critical metabolic processes (direct effect) and, in an inter-related way, by reducing environmental acidification (indirect effect) in biofilms.

TI  == competition for glucose between candida albicans and oral bacteria grown in mixed culture in a chemostat.
AB  == the competition for glucose as a growth-limiting substrate between candida albicans and a mixed community of oral bacteria was investigated. a chemostat was operated under glucose-limiting and glucose excess conditions at a dilution rate  of 0.05/h. a mixed population of oral bacteria was established and after a steady state had been reached the chemostat was inoculated with c. albicans. seven bacterial species streptococcus sanguis, s. sobrinus, s. mitis, lactobacillus casei, veillonella dispar, eubacterium saburreum and fusobacterium nucleatum - were able to establish stable populations under glucose-limiting conditions. the  yeast was unable to grow with the bacteria under glucose limitation. only three bacterial species, s. sobrinus, l. casei and e. saburreum, became established under glucose-excess conditions. c. albicans was also able to become established  in the glucose-excess chemostat and could grow and maintain a steady state in a mixed culture with these organisms. l. casei, s. mitis and s. sobrinus had faster glucose consumption rates than c. albicans. all the bacteria, except for e nucleatum, had maximum specific growth rates higher than c. albicans. the results suggest that glucose may act as a growth-limiting substrate for c. albicans in the establishment and growth of the yeast in a mixed community of oral bacteria.

TI  == automated immunofluorescence for enumeration of selected taxa in supragingival dental plaque.
AB  == the present study investigated a recently developed automated image analysis technique for its applicability to the enumeration of selected bacteria in supragingival dental plaque. following initial calibration, the system is capable to count fluorescence-labeled target cells in up to 48 samples without user interference. test samples contained a characteristic mixture of planktonic bacteria, small almost planar bacterial aggregates, and large, virtually indisruptable clumps with cells from multiple species. due to their complex composition, these samples provided a challenging validation step for the image analysis system. automated enumeration of target bacteria was compared with visual counting of the fluorescence-labeled bacteria. results are shown for six taxa (actinomyces naeslundii, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia/prev. nigrescens, streptococcus gordonii/strep. oralis/strep. sanguis, strep. sobrinus, and veillonella dispar/ v. parvula) with characteristic differences in abundance, cell morphology and aggregation behavior. results revealed good correspondence between the two enumeration techniques (correlation  coefficients ranging from 0.77 to 0.92) provided that the portion of target bacteria exceeded 0.05% of the total bacterial cell number. this work demonstrates the applicability and usefulness of fully automated immunofluorescence to analyze such complex ecosystems as supragingival dental plaque.

TI  == the establishment of a community of oral bacteria that controls the growth of candida albicans in a chemostat.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to establish and identify a community of oral bacteria that controls the growth of candida albicans in the chemostat. the chemostat was operated under glucose-limiting conditions at a dilution rate of 0.05 h-1 and inoculated with a yeast-free suspension of a tongue scraping. after  a steady state had been reached, it was inoculated with c. albicans to establish  the yeast and determine whether its growth could be contained. the steady-state community comprised the species streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus mitis, lactobacillus casei, eubacterium saburreum, veillonella dispar and fusobacterium nucleatum. bacteroides gracilus and haemophilus segnis were also detected but infrequently. yeast growth was suppressed and yeast cells  were lost at the same rate as the theoretical washout rate. it is concluded that  this mixed community of oral bacteria can be used to identify the parameters that maintain the equilibrium between oral bacteria and c. albicans in the oral cavity.

TI  == the effects of triclosan and zinc citrate, alone and in combination, on a community of oral bacteria grown in vitro.
AB  == a mixed-culture chemostat system has been used as a more stringent laboratory system for evaluation of the antimicrobial effects of triclosan and zinc citrate. the inhibitors were added alone, and in combination, as a pulse (a high initial inhibitor concentration which decreased with time) or as a dose (concentration of inhibitor increased with time) to give maximum concentrations of 34.5 mumol/l triclosan and 39.8 mumol/l zinc citrate. when dosed, triclosan inhibited a. viscosus and all five gram-negative species, whereas zinc citrate had less effect, probably due to complexation by media components. similar effects were seen when triclosan was pulsed, except that s. mutans was the most sensitive gram-positive species and v. dispar was unaffected. however, when the inhibitors  were dosed or pulsed in combination, marked complementary and additive inhibitory effects were observed, particularly against gram-negative species, although s. gordonii and s. oralis were relatively unaffected. the data confirm that increased effects can be obtained with suitable combinations of antimicrobial agents and suggest that, under certain conditions, apparently broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents may be acting more selectively than hitherto suspected.

TI  == surface-associated properties of streptococcus milleri group strains and their potential relation to pathogenesis.
AB  == thirty strains from the streptococcus milleri (anginosus) group (smg) obtained from various sources were tested for a range of characters that could be associated with pathogenicity and the results were compared with those for type strains of s. sanguis, s. mutans and s. pyogenes. the smg strains were heterogeneous in all tests. most (18) belonged to one of the lancefield groups with group f predominating. adherence of strains isolated from abscesses to buccal epithelial cells was greater than that of other strains (p = 0.033). compared with strains of s. sanguis, smg strains were generally not aggregated by human saliva. they differed from the type strain of s. pyogenes in their relative ability to bind fibrinogen and fibronectin; they were less effective in binding fibrinogen (0.33-4.28% cf. 22% for s. pyogenes) and generally more effective in binding fibronectin (0.49-12.37% cf. 0.95%). strains isolated from infections were statistically better at binding fibronectin than other strains (p less than  0.001). the ability of strains to adhere to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite (sha) varied 10-fold, from 0.16-16.35%. the amount of fibronectin bound by smg strains  correlated with their ability to adhere to sha (p less than 0.001). the hydrophobicity of the strains, as measured in the hexadecane partition assay, ranged from 0.0% to 99.0%. some strains carried both positive and negative cell-surface charges and some strains with a highly hydrophobic cell surface also possessed a relatively high cell-surface charge. a minority of strains possessed  a net positive cell-surface charge. neither hydrophobicity nor cell-surface charge was related to the capacity of strains to adhere to sha. strains of smg co-aggregated weakly with strains of veillonella parvula, v. dispar, actinomyces  viscosus and a. naeslundii.

TI  == colonization resistance of defined bacterial plaques to streptococcus mutans implantation on teeth in a model mouth.
AB  == we investigated the ability of streptococcus mutans c67-1 to colonize simple bacterial plaques and the effects of age and stability of the pre-formed plaque on colonization resistance. mixed-plaques of actinomyces viscosus wvu627, 'streptococcus mitior' lpa-1, and veillonella dispar omz193 were grown on tooth segments, mounted back to back for simulation of approximal sites in a model mouth for 66 h. s. mutans c67-1 was either included in the original inoculum or super-inoculated onto the developing plaque. inclusion of s. mutans c67-1 did not alter the total viable counts, but the proportional composition changed due to inter-species interactions. colonization resistance of the mixed-plaque samples developed within 24 h, although s. mutans c67-1 was always able to colonize these stagnation sites. colonization resistance of 24-hour plaque against a fresh isolate, s. mutans cp3, was also studied. there was greater colonization resistance by the basic plaque to this organism, compared with s. mutans c67-1, although the reasons for this were not clear. these initial experiments demonstrate the way in which the factors involved in bacterial colonization resistance in microbial films on teeth can be studied under controlled conditions.

TI  == coaggregation properties of human oral veillonella spp.: relationship to colonization site and oral ecology.
AB  == the primary habitats of oral veillonellae are the tongue, dental plaque, and the  buccal mucosa. isolates were obtained from each habitat and tested for coaggregation with a battery of other oral bacterial strains. all 59 tongue isolates tested for coaggregation were veillonella atypica or veillonella dispar. all but one of them coaggregated with strains of streptococcus salivarius, a predominant inhabitant of the tongue surface but not subgingival dental plaque. these tongue isolates were unable to coaggregate with most normal members of the  subgingival flora such as actinomyces viscosus, actinomyces naeslundii, actinomyces israelii, and streptococcus sanguis. in contrast, 24 of 29 veillonella isolates, of which 20 were veillonella parvula from subgingival dental plaque samples, coaggregated strongly with the three species of actinomyces, s. sanguis, and other bacteria usually present in subgingival plaque, but they did not coaggregate with s. salivarius. the majority of isolates from the buccal mucosa (42 of 55) has coaggregation properties like those from the tongue. these results indicate that the three human oral veillonella species  are distributed on oral surfaces that are also occupied by their coaggregation partners and thus provide strong evidence that coaggregation plays a critical role in the bacterial ecology of the oral cavity.
