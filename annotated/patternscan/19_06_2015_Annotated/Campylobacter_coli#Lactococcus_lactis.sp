TI  == inhibitory spectra and modes of antimicrobial action of gallotannins from mango kernels (mangifera indica l.).
AB  == this study investigated the antimicrobial activities and modes of action of penta-, hexa-, hepta-, octa-, nona-, and deca-o-galloylglucose (gallotannins) isolated from mango kernels. the mics and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) against food-borne bacteria and fungi were determined using a critical dilution assay. gram-positive bacteria were generally more susceptible to gallotannins than were gram-negative bacteria. the mics of gallotannins against bacillus subtilis, bacillus cereus, clostridium botulinum, campylobacter jejuni,  listeria monocytogenes, and staphylococcus aureus were 0.2 g liter(-1) or less; enterotoxigenic escherichia coli and salmonella enterica were inhibited by 0.5 to 1 g liter(-1), and lactic acid bacteria were resistant. the use of lipopolysaccharide mutants of s. enterica indicated that the outer membrane confers resistance toward gallotannins. supplementation of lb medium with iron eliminated the inhibitory activity of gallotannins against staphylococcus aureus, and siderophore-deficient mutants of s. enterica were less resistant toward gallotannins than was the wild-type strain. hepta-o-galloylglucose sensitized lactobacillus plantarum tmw1.460 to hop extract, indicating inactivation of hop resistance mechanisms, e.g., the multidrug resistance (mdr) transporter hora. carbohydrate metabolism of lactococcus lactis mg1363, a conditionally respiring organism, was influenced by hepta-o-galloylglucose when grown under aerobic conditions and in the presence of heme but not under anaerobic conditions, indicating that gallotannins influence the respiratory chain. in conclusion, the  inhibitory activities of gallotannins are attributable to their strong affinity for iron and likely additionally relate to the inactivation of membrane-bound proteins.

TI  == a dna array based assay for the characterization of microbial community in raw milk.
AB  == an oligonucleotide array based on pcr method containing a combination of probes for taxonomic markers and species-specific virulence genes was developed for the  simultaneous identification of 14 lactic acid bacteria (lab) and food-borne pathogenic bacteria in raw milk. the hypervariable regions v3 and v6 of 16s, together with a variable region of 23s rrna genes and several genes specific for  virulence factors were selected. universal primers and multiplex pcr were used for the rapid differentiation of bacterial species and low concentration of specific pathogenic and spoilage bacteria were detected in milk. the dominant species such as streptococcus thermophilus, enterococcus faecalis, lactococcus lactis, andleuconostoc lactis were identified by indirect-labelling reactions based upon incorporation of amino-allyl dutps. the results regarding food-borne pathogens detection showed highly specific hybridisation patterns with the genomic dna from campylobacter jejuni, escherichia coli, salmonella thyphimurium, listeria monocytogenes and yersinia enterocolitica. a clear differentiation of dominant species present in a complex microbial community such as raw milk was achieved by the application of short oligonucleotide probes which discriminate sequences differing by few nucleotides.

TI  == molecular structure and evolution of the conjugative multiresistance plasmid pre25 of enterococcus faecalis isolated from a raw-fermented sausage.
AB  == plasmid pre25 from enterococcus faecalis transfers resistances against kanamycin, neomycin, streptomycin, clindamycin, lincomycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, roxithromycin, tylosin, chloramphenicol, and nourseothricin sulfate by conjugation in vitro to e. faecalis jh2-2, lactococcus lactis bu2, and listeria innocua l19. its nucleotide sequence of 50237 base pairs represents the  largest, fully sequenced conjugative multiresistance plasmid of enterococci (plasmid 46 (2001) 170). the gene for chloramphenicol resistance (cat) was identified as an acetyltransferase identical to the one of plasmid pip501 of streptococcus agalactiae. erythromycin resistance is due to a 23s ribosomal rna methyl transferase, again as found in pip501 (ermb). the aminoglycoside resistance genes are packed in tandem as in transposon tn5405 of staphylococcus aureus: an aminoglycoside 6-adenyltransferase, a streptothricin acetyl transferase, and an aminoglycoside phosphotransferase.). identical resistance genes are known from pathogens like streptococcus pyogenes, s. agalactiae, s. aureus, campylobacter coli, clostridium perfringens, and clostridium difficile. pre25 is composed of a 30.5-kbp segment almost identical to pip501. of the 15 genes involved in conjugative transfer, 10 codes for putative transmembrane proteins (e.g. trsb, trac, trsf, trsj, and trsl). the enterococcal part is joined into the pip501 part by insertion elements is1216v of e. faecium tn1545 (three copies), and homologs of is1062 (e. faecalis) and is1485 (e. faecium). pre25 demonstrates that enterococci from fermented food do participate in the molecular communication between gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria of the human and animal microflora.

TI  == strong associations between gene function and codon usage.
AB  == the association between codon usage and gene function was analyzed in the complete genomes of eschericia coli, bacillus subtilis, lactococcus lactis and campylobacter jejuni, using the functional annotation provided by ncbi. two distinctly different ways of quantifying codon usage were used in the analysis. by using contingency tables it was found that for most amino acids a highly significant association with gene function exists for all species, indicating that codon usage at the level of individual amino acids is generally closely coordinated with gene function. by computing the effective number of codons in the annotated genes and comparing the median values in groups of different gene functions it was shown for all species that codon bias gene by gene also differs.

TI  == [probable nature of rickettsia prowazekii virulence].
AB  == a 29.5 kda outer membrane protein (ompb) of r. prowazekii virulent breinl strain  is known to differ from its counterpart in attenuated madrid e strain, while ompb of this latter one and of its virulent variant evir coincide in mobility. the infectivity of these strains for macrophages was previously shown to be different as well, and to correlate with their virulence. previously cloned r. prowazekii breinl strain, 1.644-bp insert from lambda gtll recombinant expressing as ompb in inducer-independent fashion was sequenced and used as a query to search for similarity in non-redundant genbank/embl/ddbj data base aided by blastx mail server. extensive homology of inferred 282-aa sequence to peptidyl-propyl cis/trans isomerase c (ppiase c) of e. coli belonging to parvulin family of rotamases (foldases), and related proteins such as campylobacter jejuni cell binding factor 2 (cbf2), b. subtilis prsa, and lactococcus lactis prtm has been revealed.

TI  == nucleotide sequence and characterization of peb4a encoding an antigenic protein in campylobacter jejuni.
AB  == the 29-kda protein peb4, a major antigen of campylobacter jejuni, is present in all c. jejuni strains tested and elicits an antibody response in infected patients. by screening a lambda gt11 library of chromosomal dna fragments of c. jejuni strain 81-176 in escherichia coli y1090 cells with antibody raised against purified peb4, a recombinant phage with a 2-kb insert expressing an immunoreactive protein of 29 kda was isolated. dna sequence analysis revealed that the insert contains two complete open reading frames orf-a and orf-b. orf-a  (peb4a) encodes a 273-residue protein with a calculated molecular mass of 30,460  daltons. the deduced amino acid sequence, composition and pl of the recombinant mature protein are similar to those determined for purified peb4. the first 21 residues resemble a signal peptide. gene bank searches indicated 33.7% identity with protein export protein prsa of bacillus subtilis and 23.8% identity with protease maturation protein precursor prtm of lactococcus lactis. pcr experiments indicate that peb4a is highly conserved among c. jejuni strains. orf-b begins 2 bp after the last codon of peb4a and encodes a putative protein of 353 residues with 63.4% identity with e. coli fructose 1,6-biphosphate aldolase. the sequence  arrangement suggests that these two genes form an operon.
