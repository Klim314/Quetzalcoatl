TI  == drug resistance and molecular epidemiology of aerobic bacteria isolated from puerperal infections in bangladesh.
AB  == puerperal infection is a common complication during postnatal period in developing countries. bacterial species, drug resistance, and genetic characteristics were investigated for a total of 470 isolates from puerperal infections in bangladesh for a 2-year period (2010-2012). the most common species was escherichia coli (n=98), followed by enterococcus faecalis (n=54), staphylococcus haemolyticus (n=33), proteus mirabilis (n=32), staphylococcus aureus (n=27), klebsiella pneumoniae (n=22), and enterobacter cloacae (n=21). s.  aureus and acinetobacter baumannii were isolated at a higher frequency from wound infections after cesarean section, while e. coli, e. cloacae, and k. pneumoniae were isolated from community-acquired endometritis and urinary tract infections.  resistance to third-generation cephalosporins was frequent for enterobacteriacae, and was mainly mediated by blactx-m-1 group beta-lactamases. the ctx-m gene in e. coli from the four phylogroups was identified as blactx-m-15, and phylogroup b2 isolates with blactx-m-15 were classified into st131 with o25b allele, harboring  aac(6')-ib-cr and various virulence factors. carbapenemase genes blandm-1 and blandm-7 were identified in one isolate each of phylogroup a e. coli. methicillin-resistant s. aureus isolates had type iv or v sccmec, including isolates of st361 (cc672), which is related to an emerging st672 clone in the indian subcontinent. this study revealed the recent epidemiological status of aerobic bacteria causing puerperal infections in bangladesh, providing useful information to improve clinical practice and infection control.

TI  == acinetobacter baumannii neonatal mastitis: a case report.
AB  == introduction: neonatal mastitis is a rare infection. when it does occur, infants  younger than 2 months of age are typically affected and the majority of cases are caused by staphylococcus aureus. we present the first reported case of neonatal mastitis caused by acinetobacter baumannii, an unusual organism for this type of  infection. case presentation: a 15-day-old full-term caucasian male neonate presented to our emergency room following fever at home and was admitted for routine neonatal sepsis evaluation. after admission, he developed purulent drainage from his right nipple, was diagnosed with mastitis, and was started on empiric therapy with clindamycin and cefotaxime with presumed coverage for s. aureus. drainage culture identified pan-susceptible acinetobacter baumannii/haemolyticus and antibiotic therapy was changed to ceftazidime. he was  discharged after 5 days of ceftazidime with complete resolution of his symptoms.  conclusions: this case illustrates the importance of obtaining drainage cultures  in mastitis cases because of the possibility of organisms besides s. aureus causing infection. acinetobacter baumannii is considered part of the normal human flora and is associated with serious infections in intensive care units. this is  the first case report describing acinetobacter baumannii as an etiologic agent of neonatal mastitis and highlights the importance of including unusual organisms in the differential for infectious etiologies for general practitioners.

TI  == tolerability and efficacy of long-term treatment with daptomycin, ceftazidime and colistin in a patient with a polymicrobial, multidrug-resistant prosthetic joint  reinfection: a case report.
AB  == introduction: prosthetic joint infections are severe complications of joint implants. further complications arise when polymicrobial and/or multidrug-resistant microorganisms are involved. currently, there are limited data on the management of these infections and on the tolerability of long-term treatment with daptomycin, ceftazidime and colistin. case presentation: a 55-year-old caucasian woman who had a right hip prosthesis removed 1 year prior because of infection was admitted for prosthesis reimplantation. on admission at  our hospital, anamnesis regarding etiology and management of prosthesis infection was not available. on clinical, laboratory findings and imaging studies infection was not suspected. a hip prosthesis was reimplanted. at surgery, histopathological and microbiological investigations were not taken. three weeks  after reimplantation, surgical site infection due to enterobacter cloacae was diagnosed and oral ciprofloxacin was prescribed. four days later, a periprosthesis fluid collection was evidenced and a percutaneous needle aspirate  grew staphylococcus epidermidis and s. haemolyticus. enterobacter genome was also detected from the same sample. teicoplanin and meropenem were added to ciprofloxacin without clinical improvement. moreover, acetabular cup dislocation  was documented. she underwent prosthesis explantation, debridement, and positioning of an antimicrobial mixed spacer. from the intraoperatory cultures s. epidermidis and acinetobacter baumannii were grown. daptomycin, ceftazidime, colistin and rifampin were administered. four days later, rifampin was stopped due to a suspected liver toxicity. while undergoing therapy she presented recurrent episodes of wound dehiscence and on the 22nd week of treatment a further surgical debridement was performed, upon which the spacer was removed. at this time, intraoperative cultures resulted negative. three months later, after a total of 8 months, antimicrobials were interrupted. subsequently, a femoral transcondylar traction was positioned, and 3 weeks later a new prosthesis was reimplanted. at over 1 year after reimplantation she is well. conclusions: our findings suggest that microbiologic investigations are mandatory even when prosthetic joint infection is not suspected. molecular methods for identification of microorganisms can be used in addition to conventional cultures especially when patients are under antibiotic treatment. daptomycin, ceftazidime and colistin can be administered for several months without side effects. guidelines  specifically addressing the diagnosis and the management of polymicrobial, multidrug-resistant prosthetic joint infections need to be developed.

TI  == the inhibitory effect of zingiber corallinum hance essential oil on drug-resistant bacteria and evaluation of its acute toxicity.
AB  == background: the excessive and irregular use of antibiotics could result in the generation and diffusion of drug-resistant bacteria. the aim of this study was to investigate the inhibitory effect of zingiber corallinum hance essential oil (zcho) on drug-resistant bacteria, especially on drug-resistant acinetobacter baumannii. material/methods: susceptibility testing was used to evaluate the effect of zcho on growth inhibition of drug-resistant bacteria by paper disk method. mice orally administered with zcho were used to observe acute toxicity and to determine median lethal dose (ld(5)(0)) of zcho. broth dilution method was used to determine minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) of zcho on drug-resistant acinetobacter baumannii. results: zcho exhibited an obvious inhibitory effect not only on gram-negative drug-resistant bacteria including escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae and acinetobacter baumannii, but also on gram-positive drug-resistant bacteria including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus haemolyticus. the zcho containing 79% terpinen-4-ol revealed better bacteriostatic effect than zcho with 34% terpinen-4-ol. the ld(5)(0) of zcho was 1790.427 mg/kg. the mic and mbc of zcho on drug-resistant acinetobacter baumannii were 1457.81 mg/l. conclusions: zcho has obvious bacteriostasis and bactericidal effects, especially against drug-resistant acinetobacter baumannii. therefore, zcho is a promising natural bioactive component with antibacterial effect and satisfactory safety due to its  low toxicity.

TI  == mixed infection in adult bacterial meningitis.
AB  == 12 adult patients suffering from bacterial meningitis caused by mixed infection were identified at kaohsiung chang gung memorial hospital over a period of 13 years (1986-1998), and they accounted for 6.5% (12/184) of our culture-proven adult bacterial meningitis. the 12 cases included seven males and five females, aged 17-74 years. six of the 12 cases had community-acquired infections and the other six had nosocomially-acquired infections. ten of the 12 cases had associated underlying diseases, with head trauma and/or neurosurgical procedure being the most frequent. both gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens were identified in these 12 cases with gram-negative pathogens outnumbering the gram-positive ones. the implicated pathogens, starting with the most frequent, included enterobacter species (enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes), klebsiella species (klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca), escherichia coli, staphylococcus species (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus haemolyticus), pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, enterococcus, serratia marcescens, citrobacter diversus, proteus mirabilis, streptococcus viridans and neisseria meningitidis. six of the 12 cases were found to have multi-antibiotic-resistant strains, which included e. cloacae in one, a. baumannii in one, k. pneumoniae in one and s. aureus in three. the management of  these 12 cases included appropriate antibiotics and neurosurgical procedures including shunt revision. despite the complexity of implicated pathogens and the  high incidence of emergence of resistant strains, the overall mortality rate (8.3%, 1/12) was not higher than that in adult bacterial meningitis. however, complete recuperation was difficult in adult patients with mixed bacterial meningitis.

TI  == [bacterial strains isolated from neutropenic patients and their resistance to antibiotics].
AB  == background: although gram negative as well as gram positive bacteria participate  in febrile episodes of neutropenic patients, in particular recently the ratio of  gram positive bacteria is increasing. the objective of the present work was to investigate the incidence and antibiotic resistance of pathogenic bacterial agents in neutropenic patients. methods and results: the presence of bacteria was investigated in 446 neutropenic patients hospitalized at the haematological clinic in 1995. haemocultures (apparatus bact/alert 120, cultivation media organon-teknika) and urine were examined. the sensitivity for antibiotics was tested by the standard dilution micromethod. in blood most frequently staphylococcus epidermidis was isolated (45.4%), coagulase-negative strains of staphylococcus haemolyticus, staphylococcus hominis and staphylococcus saprophyticus (14.4%), acinetobacter calcoaceticus-baumannii (complex 6.3%) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (6.3%). in urine the following were detected: staphylococcus epidermidis (36.5%), enterococcus sp. (14.5%), escherichia coli (13.1%), enterococcus faecalis (11.6%) and enterococcus solitarius (6.5%). in all strains resistance to antibiotics and chemotherapeutic drugs was assessed. conclusions: investigation of the frequency of different bacterial species, along with monitoring of the resistance is an essential prerequisite of initial antibiotic therapy of febrile episodes in neutropenic patients.

TI  == neonatal airway colonization with gram-negative bacilli: association with severity of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.
AB  == background: airway colonization with gram-negative bacilli (gnb) and gram-positive cocci (gpc) is common in mechanically ventilated neonates. whether  gnb are related to nosocomial bloodstream infection (bsi) and/or to the severity  of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (bpd) is unknown. methods: we prospectively examine this relationship using a cohort design. data from 260 < or = 1250-g birth weight inborn infants (1991 to 1995) intubated > or = 2 weeks included 917 serial tracheal cultures and 583 blood cultures. the severity of bpd was assessed by duration of mechanical ventilation, oxygen dependency at 36 weeks of postconceptional age and the use of home oxygen supplementation. results: after 2 weeks of ventilation, 80% of the infants were colonized with gpc (staphylococus epidermidis and staphylococcus haemolyticus in 90% of the cases). superimposed on 36% of these infants was gnb airway colonization with klebsiella pneumoniae (25%), enterobacter cloacae (25%), escherichia coli (25%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (10%), serratia marcescen (10%), acinetobacter baumannii and haemophilus influenzae (5%). comparison between 174 gpc- and 86 gnb-colonized infants showed  that demographics, birth weight, gestational age, perinatal risk factors and mortality were similar. fifteen percent of gnb-colonized infants developed bsi caused by gnb and 14% developed bsi caused by gpc. no significant temporal relationship between airway colonization and bsi was noted. gnb infants were ventilated longer and required oxygen at 36 weeks of postconceptional age and home oxygen supplementation twice as often as infants colonized only with gpc. gnb colonization was a predictor of severe bpd after controlling for ventilation. ureaplasma colonization occurred in 28% of gnb-colonized and 33% of noncolonized  infants and was not a predictor of bpd severity. conclusion: gnb airway colonization creates a moderate risk for bsi. antibiotic treatment does not regularly eradicate gnb. gnb airway colonization is associated with severe bpd, but further studies will be necessary before therapeutic efforts to eradicate gnb from the airways should be undertaken.

TI  == emergence of bacterial resistance to imipenem and ciprofloxacin in a university hospital.
AB  == we have continuously monitored the in-vitro activities of imipenem and ciprofloxacin against large numbers of non-fastidious clinical isolates. after eight years of use, 97-100% of enterobacteriaceae and acinetobacter baumannii remained susceptible to imipenem, but susceptibility of pseudomonas aeruginosa declined from 100% to 91%. after six years of use, 94%-100% of enterobacteriaceae (except providencia stuartii) remained susceptible to ciprofloxacin but susceptibility of p. stuartii, a. baumannii and p. aeruginosa declined from 100%  to 46%, 66% and 84%, respectively. oxacillin-resistant staphylococci were considered to be resistant to imipenem and all beta-lactams. there were no quinolone-resistant staphylococci observed in 1986, but susceptibilities of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus haemolyticus to ciprofloxacin decreased to 85-93% for oxacillin-susceptible strains and to 7-39% for oxacillin-resistant strains. enterococcus faecalis has remained susceptible to imipenem and the modal mic of ciprofloxacin has remained 1 mg/l; however, susceptibility to ciprofloxacin 2 mg/l decreased from 94% to 64%. imipenem-quinolone cross-resistance was observed for staphylococci but not for p. aeruginosa.
