[identification and biological properties of intestinal lactic acid bacteria isolated from aged women].
the strains of lactic acid bacteria have been isolated from the intestine of older women. these strains were identified and their biological activity was studied. it has been established that lactobacillus acidophilus, l. plantarum, l. salivarius var. salivarius and enterococcus faecium had the highest antagonistic activity against opportunistic microorganisms. it has been revealed, that the adhesive properties and antibiotic resistance of the tested cultures had strain specificity. most of the isolates were highly adhesive and did not produce hemolysins.
effect of probiotics on biomarkers of cardiovascular disease: implications for heart-healthy diets.
the objectives of this article are to review clinical trials that have examined the effects of probiotics on low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (ldl-c) and to assess the potential of probiotic intake as a therapeutic lifestyle change (tlc) dietary option. twenty-six clinical studies and two meta-analyses are reviewed. significant ldl-c reductions were observed for four probiotic strains: lactobacillus reuteri ncimb 30242, enterococcus faecium, and the combination of lactobacillus acidophilus la5 and bifidobacterium lactis bb12. two synbiotics, l. acidophilus cho-220 plus inulin and l. acidophilus plus fructo-oligosaccharides, also decreased ldl-c. of the probiotics examined, l. reuteri ncimb 30242 was found to best meet tlc dietary requirements by 1) significantly reducing ldl-c and total cholesterol, with robustness similar to that of existing tlc dietary options, 2) improving other coronary heart disease risk factors, such as inflammatory biomarkers, and 3) having "generally recognized as safe" (gras) status. based on these results, the probiotic l. reuteri ncimb 30242 is a viable candidate both for future tlc dietary studies and as a potential option for inclusion in tlc dietary recommendations.
isolation and characterization of bacteriocin-producing bacteria from the intestinal microbiota of elderly irish subjects.
aims: to isolate and characterize bacteriocins produced by predominant species of lactic acid bacteria from faeces of elderly subjects. methods and results: screening over 70,000 colonies, from faecal samples collected from 266 subjects, using the indicator organisms lactobacillus bulgaricus lmg 6901 and listeria innocua dpc 3572, identified 55 antimicrobial-producing bacteria. genomic fingerprinting following apai digestion revealed 15 distinct strains. the antimicrobial activities associated with 13 of the 15 strains were sensitive to protease treatment. the predominant antimicrobial-producing species were identified as lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus crispatus and enterococcus spp. a number of previously characterized bacteriocins, including abp-118 and salivaricin b (from lact. salivarius), enterocin b (enterococcus faecium), lactacin b (lact. acidophilus), gassericin t and a variant of gassericin a (lact. gasseri), were identified. interestingly, two antimicrobial-producing species, not generally associated with intestinally derived microorganisms were also isolated: lactococcus lactis producing nisin z and streptococcus mutans producing mutacin ii. conclusion: these data suggest that bacteriocin production by intestinal isolates against our chosen targets under the screening conditions used was not frequent (0.08%). significance and impact of the study: the results presented are important due to growing evidence indicating bacteriocin production as a potential probiotic trait by virtue of strain dominance and/or pathogen inhibition in the mammalian intestine.
study of antimicrobial activity and atomic force microscopy imaging of the action mechanism of cashew tree gum.
the aim of this work was to evaluate the antimicrobial potential of two grades of cashew tree gum (crude and purified) against eight microorganisms and to analyze the mechanism of cashew tree gum antimicrobial action via atomic force microscopy (afm) imaging. the results indicated strong antimicrobial properties of pure cashew tree gum against all tested microorganisms, except for candida albicans and lactobacillus acidophilus. on the other hand crude cashew gum showed antimicrobial activity only against gram-positive bacteria (mrsa, mssa, listeria innocua and enterococcus faecium). atomic force microscopy imaging showed that pure cashew tree gum lead to bacterial cell collapse. in conclusion cashew tree gum presented relevant antimicrobial activity against most of the studied bacteria, and the purification of the cashew gum affected its antimicrobial spectrum.
characterization of a bacteriocin produced by enterococcus faecium gm-1 isolated  from an infant.
aim: to partially characterize the bacteriocin produced by the gm-1 strain of enterococcus faecium, isolated from the faeces of a newborn human infant. methods and results: the bacteriocin produced by e. faecium gm-1 showed a broad spectrum of activity against indicator strains of escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, vibrio spp., salmonella typhimurium, listeria monocytogenes, lactobacillus acidophilus, and streptococcus thermophilus. treatment of the gm-1 bacteriocin with proteolytic enzymes reduced its inhibitory activities. the bacteriocin was stable at 100 degrees c for 20 min and displayed inhibitory activity at neutral ph. the optimal production of bacteriocin from e. faecium gm-1 was obtained when the culture conditions were ph 6.0-6.5 and 35-40 degrees c. the inhibitory activity of the bacteriocin was not substantially changed by the use of different carbon sources in the media, except when galactose was substituted for glucose. the use of a sole nitrogen source caused a decrease in inhibitory activity. a bacteriocin gene similar to enterocin p was identified from the total dna of e. faecium gm-1 by pcr and direct sequencing methods. conclusion: e. faecium gm-1, which was isolated from the faeces of a newborn baby, produces an enterocin p-like bacteriocin with inhibitory activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including food-borne pathogens. significance and impact of the study: e. faecium gm-1, isolated from infant faeces, produces a new bacteriocin that is similar to enterocin p. this bacteriocin is heat stable and has a broad antibacterial spectrum that includes both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
growth inhibition of intestinal bacteria and mutagenicity of 2-, 3-, 4-aminobiphenyls, benzidine, and biphenyl.
2-aminobiphenyl (2-abp), 3-aminobiphenyl (3-abp) and 4-aminobiphenyl (4-abp), but not benzidine (bz) and biphenyl (bp), were found to be inhibitory to the growth of human intestinal bacteria bifidobacterium infantis atcc 15697, b. bifidium atcc 11863, clostridium perfringens atcc 13124, escherichia coli atcc 25922, e. coli atcc 35218, enterobacter cloacae atcc 13047 and salmonella typhimurium ta98, ta100, yg1041 at 10-200 microg/ml in culture broth. bacteroides distasonis atcc 8503, b. fragilis atcc 25285, b. theataiotaomicron atcc 29741, c. paraputrificum atcc 26780, c. clostridiiforme atcc 25537, lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356 and enterococcus faecium atcc 19434 were not inhibited by the above mentioned compounds in concentrations up to 200 microg/ml. the ames salmonella/microsome assay was employed to test the mutagenicity of the above-mentioned compounds using strains ta98 and ta100 in the presence and absence of aroclor 1254-induced rat s9 mix. it was found that 4-abp was mutagenic to both ta98 and ta100, and bz was mutagenic to ta98 in the presence of rat s9 mix. 2-aminobiphenyl, 3-abp, and bp were not mutagenic to both strains tested. 2-aminobiphenyl and 3-abp are chemical isomers of 4-abp and are as strong as 4-abp in inhibiting the growth of intestinal bacteria but not as mutagenic as 4-abp. evidence suggested that the mechanism of growth inhibition is not involved with the interaction of dna that causes mutations, but rather on the electron transport system of these organisms.
in vitro antimicrobial activities of bakuchiol against oral microorganisms.
bakuchiol was isolated from the seeds of psoralea corylifolia, a tree native to china with various uses in traditional medicine, followed by extraction with ether and column chromatography combined with silica gel and octyldecyl silane. in this study, the antimicrobial activities of bakuchiol against some oral microorganisms were evaluated in vitro. the cell growth of streptococcus mutans was inhibited in a bakuchiol concentration-dependent manner, and growth of s. mutans was completely prevented by 20 microg of bakuchiol per ml. the bactericidal effect of bakuchiol on s. mutans was dependent on temperature and stable under the following conditions: sucrose, 0 to 10% (wt/vol); ph, 3.0 to 7.0; organic acids (3% [wt/vol] citric and malic acids). bakuchiol showed bactericidal effects against all bacteria tested, including s. mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sobrinus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus plantarum, actinomyces viscosus, and porphyromonas gingivalis, with mics ranging from 1 to 4 microg/ml and the sterilizing concentration for 15 min ranging from 5 to 20 microg/ml. furthermore, bakuchiol was also effective against adherent cells of s. mutans in water-insoluble glucan in the presence of sucrose and inhibited the reduction of ph in the broth. thus, bakuchiol would be a useful compound for development of antibacterial agents against oral pathogens and has great potential for use in food additives and mouthwash for preventing and treating dental caries.
a microbiology investigation on probiotic pharmaceutical products used for human  health.
many and different probiotic pharmaceutical products are presently commercialised in the world. on this regard, a microbiological investigation was carried out to screen the microorganisms incorporated into these products, commonly used for human health. after determination of the cell number and viability of bacteria, several experiments were performed in vitro in order to characterise the microorganisms and to evaluate their probiotic value. among all the strains identified, best results were obtained with lactobacillus rhamnosus, enterococcus faecium and saccharomyces cerevisiae as far as regards growth rates, ph and bile salts tolerance. moreover, the identification profiles of microorganisms showed a better reliability for the products containing a single species whereas the ones composed of different strains were usually not satisfactory. in some cases, the presence of lactobacillus and saccharomyces species was in disagreement with the claimed composition of the product and some species of lactobacilli, bifidobacteria and streptococci were found not viable. in defined mixed cultures experiments, the antagonism of lactobacillus acidophilus and enterococcus faecium versus yersinia enterocolitica was demonstrated and explained as acid and/or antimicrobials production.
in vitro fructooligosaccharide utilization and inhibition of salmonella spp. by selected bacteria.
in vitro experiments were conducted to determine: 1) inhibitory capacities of potential direct-fed microbial bacteria against salmonella serotypes; and 2) the ability of bifidobacterium bifidum, enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus casei, lactococcus lactis, pediococcus sp., and salmonella spp. to grow in media containing fructooligosaccharides (fos-50 or fos pure formulation) as the only carbohydrate source. thirteen bacteria (two strains of bacillus coagulans, bacillus licheniformis, bacillus subtilis, b. bifidum, e. faecium, two strains of lactobacillus acidophilus, l. casei, pediococcus sp., propionibacterium acidopropionici, p. jensenii, and propionibacterium sp.) were tested for inhibition of six salmonella serotypes (s. california, s. enteritidis, s. heidelberg, s. mission, s. senftenberg, and s. typhimurium) using a spot-the-lawn technique. bifidobacterium bifidum, e. faecium, all lactobacilli, and pediococcus sp. clearly inhibited growth of all salmonella serotypes. in the growth experiments, e. faecium, l. lactis, and pediococcus sp. grew in media with either fos-50 or the pure formulation of fos as the sole carbohydrate source. all tested salmonella serotypes utilized fos-50 for growth; however growth varied among the serotypes. in contrast, none of the salmonella serotypes grew in media containing the pure formulation of fos as the only carbohydrate source.
serum cholesterol levels in axenic mice colonized with enterococcus faecium and lactobacillus acidophilus.
hypocholesterolemic effect was shown in axenic, mono, bicolonized and conventional mice: the effect was different depending on probiotic properties of intestinal microorganisms. contamination by enterococcus faecium cx determined the highest effect: haematic cholesterol level decrease was 16.9% in females and 7.8% in males. in mice contaminated by lactobacillus acidophilus n5 the decrease of haematic cholesterol levels was less and not relevant in mice contaminated by conventional microflora. enterococcus faecium cx and lactobacillus acidophilus n5 strains were able to grow in presence of bile salts, to colonize intestinal tract, to survive at gastric conditions and to assimilate cholesterol (e. faecium more than l. acidophilus). the authors consider the possibility to associate probiotic strains with these characteristics for the health of consumers.
