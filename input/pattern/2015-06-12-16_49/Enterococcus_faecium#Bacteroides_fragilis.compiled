TI  - Maternal exposure to fish oil primes offspring to harbor intestinal pathobionts associated with altered immune cell balance.
AB  - Our previous studies revealed that offspring from rat dams fed fish oil (at 8% and 18% energy), developed impaired intestinal barriers sensitizing the colon to exacerbated injury later in life. To discern the mechanism, we hypothesized that in utero exposure to fish oil, rich in n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA), caused abnormal intestinal reparative responses to mucosal injury through differences in intestinal microbiota and the presence of naive immune cells. To identify such mechanisms, gut microbes and naive immune cells were compared between rat pups born to dams fed either n-6 PUFA, n-3 PUFA or breeder chow. Maternal exposure to either of the PUFA rich diets altered the development of the intestinal microbiota with an overall reduction in microbial density. Using qPCR, we found that each type of PUFA differentially altered the major gut phyla; fish oil increased Bacteroidetes and safflower oil increased Firmicutes. Both PUFA diets reduced microbes known to dominate the infant gut like Enterobacteriaceae and Bifidobacteria spp. when compared to the chow group. Uniquely, maternal fish oil diets resulted in offspring showing blooms of opportunistic pathogens like Bilophila wadsworthia, Enterococcus faecium and Bacteroides fragilis in their gut microbiota. As well, fish oil groups showed a reduction in colonic CD8+ T cells, CD4+ Foxp3+ T cells and arginase+ M2 macrophages. In conclusion, fish oil supplementation in pharmacological excess, at 18% by energy as shown in this study, provides an example where excess dosing in utero can prime offspring to harbor intestinal pathobionts and alter immune cell homeostasis.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and its susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents--special references to bacteria isolated between April 2010 and March 2011].
AB  - Bacteria isolated from surgical infections during the period from April 2010 to March 2011 were investigated in a multicenter study in Japan, and the following results were obtained. In this series, 631 strains including 25 strains of Candida spp. were isolated from 170 (81.7%) of 208 patients with surgical infections. Four hundred and twenty two strains were isolated from primary infections, and 184 strains were isolated from surgical site infection. From primary infections, anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria were predominant, followed by aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, while from surgical site infection aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant, followed by anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria. Among aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Enterococcus spp. such as Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, and Enterococcus avium was highest, followed by Streptococcus spp. such as Streptococcus anginosus and Staphylococcus spp. such as Staphylococcus aureus, in this order, from primary infections, while Enterococcus spp. such as E. faecalis and E. faecium was highest, followed by Staphylococcus spp. such as S. aureus from surgical site infection. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in this order, and from surgical site infection, E. coli and R aeruginosa were most predominantly isolated, followed by E. cloacae and K. pneumoniae. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rates of Parvimonas micra, Eggerthella lenta, Streptococcus constellatus, Gemella morbillorum, and Collinsella aerofaciens were the highest from primary infections, and the isolation rate from surgical site infection was generally low. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of Bilophila wadsworthia was the highest from primary infections, followed by, Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides ovatus, and from surgical site infection, B. fragilis was most predominantly isolated, followed by Bacteroides thetaiotaomnicron, in this order. In this series, vancomycin-resistant MRSA (methicillin-resistant S. aureus), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp. and multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa were not observed.
TI  - Use of accuracy profile procedure to validate a real-time PCR method to quantify  bacteria in feces.
AB  - This study describes a novel validation procedure of real-time PCR based on accuracy profile to estimate bacterial concentrations in fecal samples. To assess the performance of the method, measurements of axenic fecal samples spiked with a measured quantity of known bacterial species (Bacteroides fragilis, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Enterococcus faecium, and Escherichia coli) were performed under repeatability and intermediate precision conditions. Data collected were used to compute a tolerance interval that was compared to a defined acceptance interval. It is concluded that the method is valid and relevant for the studied validation range of 8.20-10.24 and 7.43-9.47 log10 CFU/g of feces to ensure proper measurement of B. fragilis and E. coli, respectively. The LOQ is 8.20 and 7.43 log10 CFU/g of feces. In contrast, the method is not valid for the quantification of E. faecium and B. adolescentis, but by applying a correction factor of +0.63 log10 CFU/g, it can be considered valid for E. faecium. This correction is included in the final results. In conclusion, the accuracy profile is a statistical tool that is easy to use and totally adapted to validate real-time PCR.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activities of SMT19969, a new antimicrobial agent, against Clostridium difficile and 350 gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic intestinal flora isolates.
AB  - The comparative in vitro activity of SMT19969, a novel, narrow-spectrum, nonabsorbable agent, was studied against 50 ribotype-defined Clostridium difficile strains, 174 Gram-positive and 136 Gram-negative intestinal anaerobes, and 40 Gram-positive aerobes. SMT19969 was one dilution more active against C. difficile isolates (MIC range, 0.125 to 0.5 mug/ml; MIC90, 0.25 mug/ml), including ribotype 027 strains, than fidaxomicin (range, 0.06 to 1 mug/ml; MIC90, 0.5 mug/ml) and two to six dilutions lower than either vancomycin or metronidazole. SMT19969 and fidaxomicin were generally less active against Gram-negative anaerobes, especially the Bacteroides fragilis group species, than vancomycin and metronidazole, suggesting that SMT19969 has a lesser impact on the normal intestinal microbiota that maintain colonization resistance. SMT19969 showed limited activity against other Gram-positive anaerobes, including Bifidobacteria species, Eggerthella lenta, Finegoldia magna, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, with MIC90s of >512, >512, 64, and 64 mug/ml, respectively. Clostridium species showed various levels of susceptibility, with C. innocuum being susceptible (MIC90, 1 mug/ml) and C. ramosum and C. perfringens being nonsusceptible (MIC90, >512 mug/ml). Activity against Lactobacillus spp. (range, 0.06 to >512 mug/ml; MIC90, >512 mug/ml) was comparable to that of fidaxomicin and varied by species and strain. Gram-positive aerobic cocci (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, E. faecium, and streptococci) showed high SMT19969 MIC90 values (128 to >512 mug/ml).
TI  - [Antimicrobial susceptibility of clinical isolates of aerobic gram-positive cocci and anaerobic bacteria in 2008].
AB  - The activity of antibacterial agents against aerobic Gram-positive cocci (25 genus or species, 1029 strains) and anaerobic bacteria (21 genus or species, 187 strains) isolated from clinical specimens in 2008 at 16 clinical facilities in Japan were studied using either broth microdilution or agar dilution method. The ratio of methicillin-resistant strains among Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis was 59.6% and 81.2%, suggesting that resistant strains were isolated at high frequency. Vancomycin (VCM), linezolid (LZD) and quinupristin/dalfopristin (QPR/DPR) had good antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant S. aureus and methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis, with MIC90s of < or = 2 microg/mL. The ratio of penicillin (PC) intermediate and resistant strains classified by mutations of PC-binding proteins among Streptococcus pneumoniae was 92.0% that was highest among our previous reports. Cefpirome, carbapenems, VCM, teicoplanin (TEIC), LZD and QPR/DPR had MIC90s of < or = 1 microg/mL against PC-intermediate and resistant S. pneumoniae strains. Against all strains of Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium, the MICs of VCM and TEIC were under 2 microg/mL, and no resistant strain was detected, suggesting that these agents had excellent activities against these species. 15.9% of E. faecalis strains and 1.2% of E. faecium strains showed intermediate to LZD. 17.1% of E. faecium strains showed intermediate or resistant to QPR/DPR. Against all strains of Clostridium difficile, the MIC of VCM was under 1 microg/mL, suggesting that VCM had excellent activity. Carbapenems showed good activity against Clostridiales, Bacteroides spp., and Prevotella spp., but one strain of Bacteroides fragilis showed resistant to carbapenems. And so, the susceptibility of this species should be well-focused in the future at detecting continuously.
TI  - Ceftaroline fosamil in the treatment of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia and acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections.
AB  - Ceftaroline fosamil is a cephalosporin antibacterial approved by the US Food and  Drug Administration (FDA) for use in the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) and community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP). After intravenous administration, ceftaroline fosamil is rapidly converted to its bioactive metabolite, ceftaroline. Ceftaroline has broad-spectrum in vitro activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including contemporary resistant Gram-positive phenotypes, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and multidrug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. Because of its unique spectrum of activity, the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) designated ceftaroline as a member of a new subclass of beta-lactam antimicrobials, cephalosporins with anti-MRSA activity. The activity of ceftaroline against S. aureus extends to heteroresistant vancomycin-intermediate, vancomycin-intermediate, vancomycin-resistant and daptomycin-nonsusceptible isolates. Ceftaroline has low minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for all tested species of streptococci, and has potent activity against S. pneumoniae isolates with varying degrees of penicillin resistance. The activity of ceftaroline is limited against Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium and against anaerobes such as Bacteroides fragilis. The in vitro activity of ceftaroline includes many Gram-negative pathogens, but does not extend to bacteria that produce extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, class B metallo-beta-lactamases or AmpC cephalosporinases, or to most nonfermentative Gram-negative bacilli. Ceftaroline fosamil has been studied for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSI) and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in phase III randomized, double-blind, international, multicentre noninferiority clinical trials. Two identical trials (CANVAS 1 and CANVAS 2) compared the efficacy of ceftaroline fosamil with that of vancomycin plus aztreonam in 1378 adults with cSSSI. Results demonstrated that ceftaroline was noninferior to vancomycin plus aztreonam, with 91.6% in the ceftaroline fosamil group (pooled analysis) achieving clinical response compared with 92.7% in the vancomycin plus aztreonam group (difference -1.1%, 95% CI -4.2, 2.0). An additional analysis evaluated clinical cure in a subgroup of patients who met the FDA guidance definition of ABSSSI at treatment day 3. Clinical response, defined as cessation of lesion spread and absence of fever, was 74.0% in the ceftaroline fosamil group compared with 66.2% in the vancomycin plus aztreonam group (treatment difference 7.8%, 95% CI 1.3, 14.0). Clinical efficacy of ceftaroline fosamil in 1240 hospitalized adults with CAP was compared with that of ceftriaxone in two additional phase III trials (FOCUS 1 and FOCUS 2). Of note, because ceftriaxone does not have activity against MRSA, patients with confirmed or suspected MRSA CAP were excluded from the FOCUS trials. Results demonstrated that ceftaroline was noninferior to ceftriaxone, with 84.3% in the ceftaroline fosamil group achieving clinical cure compared with 77.7% in the ceftriaxone group (difference 6.7%, 95% CI 1.6, 11.8). An additional analysis of the trials was conducted in patients with moderate to severe CAP and at least one proven typical bacterial pathogen at baseline (i.e. CABP). Day 4 clinical response rates were 69.5% for ceftaroline and 59.4% for ceftriaxone (difference 10.1%, 95% CI -0.6, 20.6). In the phase III trials, adverse event rates were similar between groups. Overall, ceftaroline is well tolerated, which is consistent with the good safety and tolerability profile of the cephalosporin class. In summary, ceftaroline fosamil is a broad-spectrum parenteral cephalosporin with excellent in vitro activity against resistant Gram-positive pathogens, including MRSA, as well as many common Gram-negative organisms. It is a welcome treatment option for ABSSSI and CABP.
TI  - [Antimicrobial susceptibility of clinical isolates of aerobic Gram-positive cocci and anaerobic bacteria in 2006].
AB  - The activity of antibacterial agents against aerobic Gram-positive cocci (26 species, 1022 strains) and anaerobic bacteria (23 species, 184 strains) isolated from clinical specimens in 2006 at 16 clinical facilities in Japan were studied using either broth microdilution or agar dilution method. The ratio of methicillin-resistant strains among Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis was 53.0% and 65.8%, suggesting that resistant strains were isolated at high frequency. Vancomycin (VCM) and quinupristin/dalfopristin (QPR/DPR) had good antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant S. aureus and methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis, with MIC90s of < or = 2 micrcog/mL. The ratio of penicillin (PC) intermediate and resistant strains classified by mutations of PC-binding proteins among Streptococcus pneumoniae was 87.6%. Ceftriaxone, cefpirome, cefepime, carbapenem antibiotics, VCM, teicoplanin, linezolid(LZD) and QPR/DPR had MIC90s of < or = 1 microg/mL against PC-intermediate and resistant S. pneumoniae strains. Against all strains of Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium, the MICs of VCM and TEIC were under 2 microg/mL, and no resistant strain was detected, suggesting that these agents had excellent activities against these species. 10.9% of E. faecalis strains or 3.5% of E. faecium strains showed intermediate or resistant to LZD. 24.4% of E. faecium strains showed intermediate or resistant to QPR/DPR. Against all strains of Clostridium difficile, the MIC of VCM were under 1 microg/mL, suggesting that VCM had excellent activity against C. difficile. Carbapenems showed good activity against Peptococcaceae, Bacteroides spp., and Prevotella spp. However since several strains of Bacteroides fragilis showed resistant to carbapenems and the susceptibility of this species should be well-focused in the future.
TI  - Susceptibility to tigecycline of isolates from samples collected in hospitalized  patients with secondary peritonitis undergoing surgery.
AB  - Activity of tigecycline against nosocomial secondary peritonitis isolates collected along 18 months in 29 Spanish hospitals was tested by Etest in a central laboratory, considering Food and Drug Administration (FDA)/British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy (BSAC)/European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) breakpoints. A total of 600 facultative/aerobic isolates (392 Gram negative, 208 Gram positive) and 100 anaerobes were tested. None of the 220 Escherichia coli isolates was resistant to tigecycline (MIC(50)/MIC(90) = 0.25/0.5 microg/mL), with 0.5% (FDA breakpoint) and 3.6% (BSAC/EUCAST breakpoint) intermediate strains. All Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing E. coli isolates (15 strains), all Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Klebsiella oxytoca isolates (42 strains) were susceptible to tigecycline. No isolates resistant to tigecycline were found among Streptococcus viridans, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecium, but 18.9% of Enterococcus faecalis strains were intermediate following BSAC/EUCAST breakpoints. All (but 1) isolates of the Bacteroides fragilis group (n = 45) were tigecycline susceptible, as well as Gram-positive anaerobes. Tigecycline offers an adequate activity profile against isolates from secondary peritonitis when tested by Etest regardless of the breakpoints used for categorization.
TI  - Ceftaroline: a novel broad-spectrum cephalosporin with activity against meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Ceftaroline is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin currently under clinical investigation for the treatment of complicated skin and skin-structure infections (cSSSI), including those caused by meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Ceftaroline has the ability to bind to penicillin-binding protein (PBP)2a, an MRSA-specific PBP that has low affinity for most other beta-lactam antibacterials. The high binding affinity of ceftaroline to PBP2a (median inhibitory concentration 0.90 microg/mL) correlates well with its low minimum inhibitory concentration for MRSA. Ceftaroline is active in vitro against Gram-positive cocci, including MRSA, meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis, penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (not E. faecium). The broad-spectrum activity of ceftaroline includes many Gram-negative pathogens but does not extend to extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing or AmpC-derepressed Enterobacteriaceae or most nonfermentative Gram-negative bacilli. Ceftaroline demonstrates limited activity against anaerobes such as Bacteroides fragilis and non-fragilis Bacteroides spp. Limited data show that ceftaroline has a low propensity to select for resistant subpopulations. Ceftaroline fosamil (prodrug) is rapidly converted by plasma phosphatases to active ceftaroline. For multiple intravenous doses of 600 mg given over 1 h every 12 hours for 14 days, the maximum plasma concentration was 19.0 microg/mL and 21.0 microg/mL for first and last dose, respectively. Ceftaroline has a volume of distribution of 0.37 L/kg (28.3 L), low protein binding (<20%) and a serum half-life of 2.6 hours. No drug accumulation occurs with multiple doses and elimination occurs primarily through renal excretion (49.6%). Based on Monte Carlo simulations, dosage adjustment is recommended for patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30-50 mL/min); no adjustment is needed for mild renal impairment. Currently, limited clinical trial data are available for ceftaroline. A phase II study randomized 100 patients with cSSSI to intravenous ceftaroline 600 mg every 12 hours or intravenous vancomycin 1 g every 12 hours with or without intravenous aztreonam 1 g every 8 hours (standard therapy) for 7-14 days. Clinical cure rates were 96.7% for ceftaroline compared with 88.9% for standard therapy. Adverse events were similar between groups and generally mild in nature. In a phase III trial, 702 patients with cSSSI were randomized to ceftaroline 600 mg or vancomycin 1 g plus aztreonam 1 g, each administered intravenously every 12 hours for 5-14 days. Ceftaroline was noninferior to vancomycin plus aztreonam in treating cSSSI caused by both Gram-positive and -negative pathogens. Adverse event rates were similar between groups. Ceftaroline is well tolerated, which is consistent with the good safety and tolerability profile of the cephalosporin class. In summary, ceftaroline is a promising treatment for cSSSI and CAP, and has potential to be used as monotherapy for polymicrobial infections because of its broad-spectrum activity. Further clinical studies are needed to determine the efficacy and safety of ceftaroline, and to define its role in patient care.
TI  - Multiplexed identification of blood-borne bacterial pathogens by use of a novel 16S rRNA gene PCR-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis assay.
AB  - We have developed a novel high-throughput PCR-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis (PCR-LDR-CE) assay for the multiplexed identification of 20 blood-borne pathogens (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Neisseria meningitidis, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacillus anthracis, Yersinia pestis, Francisella tularensis, and Brucella abortus), the last four of which are biothreat agents. The method relies on the amplification of two regions within the bacterial 16S rRNA gene, using universal PCR primers and querying the identity of specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms within the amplified regions in a subsequent LDR. The ligation products vary in color and size and are separated by CE. Each organism generates a specific pattern of ligation products, which can be used to distinguish the pathogens using an automated software program we developed for that purpose. The assay has been verified on 315 clinical isolates and demonstrated a detection sensitivity of 98%. Additionally, 484 seeded blood cultures were tested, with a detection sensitivity of 97.7%. The ability to identify geographically variant strains of the organisms was determined by testing 132 isolates obtained from across the United States. In summary, the PCR-LDR-CE assay can successfully identify, in a multiplexed fashion, a panel of 20 blood-borne pathogens with high sensitivity and specificity.
TI  - DNA microarray for detection of macrolide resistance genes.
AB  - A DNA microarray was developed to detect bacterial genes conferring resistance to macrolides and related antibiotics. A database containing 65 nonredundant genes selected from publicly available DNA sequences was constructed and used to design 100 oligonucleotide probes that could specifically detect and discriminate all 65 genes. Probes were spotted on a glass slide, and the array was reacted with DNA templates extracted from 20 reference strains of eight different bacterial species (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Escherichia coli, and Bacteroides fragilis) known to harbor 29 different macrolide resistance genes. Hybridization results showed that probes reacted with, and only with, the expected DNA templates and allowed discovery of three unexpected genes, including msr(SA) in B. fragilis, an efflux gene that has not yet been described for gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - In vitro activities of tigecycline, ertapenem, isepamicin, and other antimicrobial agents against clinically isolated organisms in Taiwan.
AB  - This study evaluated the in vitro activities of tigecycline, ertapenem, isepamicin, and other comparators against 861 bacterial isolates recovered from patients treated in three major teaching hospitals in 2003. MICs to antimicrobial agents were determined by the agar dilution method. High rates of oxacillin resistance (58%) in Staphylococcus aureus (60 isolates), and vancomycin resistance (21%) and quinupristin-dalfopristin non-susceptibility (39%) in Enterococcus faecium (34 isolates) were found. Carbapenems had excellent in vitro activities (>or=98% susceptibility) against the 419 isolates of Enterobacteriaceae, with the MIC(50) and MIC(90) of imipenem, meropenem, and ertapenem being 0.25 and 4 mg/L, 0.03 and 0.12 mg/L, and 0.03 and 0.5 mg/L, respectively. For, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (74 isolates) and Burkholderia cepacia (21 isolates), meropenem (MIC(90), 0.25, 2, and 4 mg/L, respectively) had better in vitro activities than imipenem (MIC(90), 8, 4, and 32 mg/L, respectively) and ertapenem (MIC(90), 0.5, >32, and 32 mg/L, respectively). Isepamicin had a similar activity with amikacin against all Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, B. cepacia, and Acinetobacter baumannii, except for C. freundii isolates in which isepamicin had an eight-fold activity better than amikacin. Tigecycline had excellent in vitro activities against all isolates tested (MIC(90), <or=1 mg/L) including 14 pandrugresistant A. baumannii isolates (MICs, 1-4 mg/L), except for Proteus mirabilis (59 isolates; MIC(90), 8 mg/L), Bacteroides fragilis (60 isolates; MIC(90), 8 mg/L), P. aeruginosa (MIC(90), 16 mg/L), and B. cepacia (21 isolates; MIC(90), 16 mg/L). Tigecycline, carbapenems, and isepamicin exhibited better or comparable in vitro activities against a wide spectrum of commonly encountered bacteria than other comparator antimicrobials and may represent therapeutic options for infections due to multidrug-resistant pathogens.
TI  - Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of linezolid in obese patients with cellulitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Linezolid is an oxazolidinone antimicrobial with excellent oral bioavailability and tissue penetration and is active against multidrug-resistant skin/soft tissue pathogens. OBJECTIVE: To study the pharmacokinetics and antibacterial activity of linezolid against selective skin/soft tissue pathogens in obese patients. METHODS: We obtained multiple serum samples from 7 obese patients (>50% over their calculated ideal body weight) receiving oral linezolid 600 mg every 12 hours for treatment of cellulitis. Following a minimum of 3 doses, serum concentrations of linezolid were measured in each subject prior to (trough) and 1 and 6 hours after a dose. These samples were then tested against clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (linezolid minimum inhibitory concentrations [MICs] 1.0, 2.0, 4.0 microg/mL) and one strain each of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE) (MIC 2.0 microg/mL), Bacteroides fragilis (MIC 2.0 microg/mL), and Peptostreptococcus magnus (MIC 1.0 microg/mL). Serum inhibitory titers (SITs) and bactericidal titers (SBTs) were measured at each time point, and the median activity for these 7 patients was calculated. RESULTS: Mean linezolid serum concentrations were 4.2, 12.3, and 7.2 microg/mL at these respective time points. Median SITs for 12 hours (100% of the dosing interval) were observed against each organism with the exception of the least susceptible strain of MRSA (MIC 4.0 microg/mL); serum inhibitory activity was observed only at the one-hour time point against this isolate. Furthermore, prolonged (> or =6 h) median SBTs were observed against one isolate of MRSA (MIC 1.0 microg/mL) as well as the strain of VRE and P. magnus. CONCLUSIONS: Serum concentrations of oral linezolid in this patient population were diminished compared with those of healthy volunteers, but still provided prolonged serum inhibitory activity against common pathogens associated with skin/soft tissue infections. One treatment concern would be an obese patient receiving oral linezolid who was infected with a less susceptible (MIC > or =4.0 microg/mL) strain of S. aureus. Bactericidal activity was also observed against selective pathogens.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo activities of novel 2-(thiazol-2-ylthio)-1beta-methylcarbapenems with potent activities against multiresistant gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - SM-197436, SM-232721, and SM-232724 are new 1beta-methylcarbapenems with a unique 4-substituted thiazol-2-ylthio moiety at the C-2 side chain. In agar dilution susceptibility testing these novel carbapenems were active against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) with a MIC(90) of </=4 micro g/ml. Furthermore, SM-232724 showed strong bactericidal activity against MRSA, in contrast to linezolid, which was bacteriostatic up to four times the MIC. SM-232724 showed good therapeutic efficacy comparable to those of vancomycin and linezolid against systemic infections of MRSA in cyclophosphamide-treated mice. The MICs of SM-197436, SM-232721, and SM-232724 for streptococci, including penicillin-intermediate and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae strains, ranged from </=0.063 to 0.5 micro g/ml. These drugs were the most active beta-lactams tested against Enterococcus faecium, and the MIC(90) s for ampicillin-resistant E. faecium ranged between 8 and 16 micro g/ml, which were slightly higher than the value for linezolid. However, time-kill assays revealed the superior bactericidal activity of SM-232724 compared to those of quinupristin-dalfopristin and linezolid against an E. faecium strain with a 4-log reduction in CFU at four times the MIC after 24 h of exposure to antibiotics. In addition, SM-232724 significantly reduced the numbers of bacteria in a murine abscess model with the E. faecium strain: its efficacy was superior to that of linezolid, although the MICs (2 micro g/ml) of these two agents are the same. Among gram-negative bacteria, these three carbapenems were highly active against Haemophilus influenzae (including ampicillin-resistant strains), Moraxella catarrhalis, and Bacteroides fragilis, and showed antibacterial activity equivalent to that of imipenem for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus spp. Thus, these new carbapenems are promising candidates for agents to treat nosocomial bacterial infections by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, especially multiresistant gram-positive cocci, including MRSA and vancomycin-resistant enterococci.
TI  - Antiviral activity of N-benzoylphenylisoserinates of Lactarius sesquiterpenoid alcohols in vitro.
AB  - Cytotoxic, antiviral, antibacterial and antifungal properties of a new, originally synthesised group of compounds: the N-benzoylphenylisoserinates of sesquiterpenoid alcohols - derivatives of taxol and various sesquiterpenes of Lactarius origin were evaluated in vitro. Among 16 compounds tested, 6 decreased HSV-1 titres. Selectivity indices ranged from 13.9 to 31.7. No activity against RNA viruses (parainfluenza 3, Coxsackie B3, vesicular stomatitis virus, and encephalomyocarditis virus), bacteria: Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecium and Bacteroides fragilis and fungal strain of Candida albicans was detected.
TI  - Growth inhibition of intestinal bacteria and mutagenicity of 2-, 3-, 4-aminobiphenyls, benzidine, and biphenyl.
AB  - 2-Aminobiphenyl (2-ABP), 3-aminobiphenyl (3-ABP) and 4-aminobiphenyl (4-ABP), but not benzidine (Bz) and biphenyl (Bp), were found to be inhibitory to the growth of human intestinal bacteria Bifidobacterium infantis ATCC 15697, B. bifidium ATCC 11863, Clostridium perfringens ATCC 13124, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, E. coli ATCC 35218, Enterobacter cloacae ATCC 13047 and Salmonella typhimurium TA98, TA100, YG1041 at 10-200 microg/ml in culture broth. Bacteroides distasonis ATCC 8503, B. fragilis ATCC 25285, B. theataiotaomicron ATCC 29741, C. paraputrificum ATCC 26780, C. clostridiiforme ATCC 25537, Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356 and Enterococcus faecium ATCC 19434 were not inhibited by the above mentioned compounds in concentrations up to 200 microg/ml. The Ames Salmonella/microsome assay was employed to test the mutagenicity of the above-mentioned compounds using strains TA98 and TA100 in the presence and absence of Aroclor 1254-induced rat S9 mix. It was found that 4-ABP was mutagenic to both TA98 and TA100, and Bz was mutagenic to TA98 in the presence of rat S9 mix. 2-Aminobiphenyl, 3-ABP, and Bp were not mutagenic to both strains tested. 2-Aminobiphenyl and 3-ABP are chemical isomers of 4-ABP and are as strong as 4-ABP in inhibiting the growth of intestinal bacteria but not as mutagenic as 4-ABP. Evidence suggested that the mechanism of growth inhibition is not involved with the interaction of DNA that causes mutations, but rather on the electron transport system of these organisms.
TI  - Development of a membrane-array method for the detection of human intestinal bacteria in fecal samples.
AB  - A membrane-array method was developed for the detection of human intestinal bacteria in fecal samples without using the expensive microarray-arrayer and laser-scanner. The 16S rDNA sequences of 20 predominant human intestinal bacterial species were used to design oligonucleotide probes. Three 40-mer oligonucleotides specific for each bacterial species (total 60 probes) were synthesized and applied to nitrocellulose membranes. Digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled 16S rDNAs were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from human fecal samples or pure cultured bacteria using two universal primers, and were hybridized to the membrane-array. Hybridization signals were read by NBT/BCIP color development. The 20 intestinal bacterial species tested were Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, B. vulgatus, B. fragilis, B. distasonis, Clostridium clostridiiforme, C. leptum, Fusobacterium prausnitzii, Peptostreptococcus productus, Ruminococcus obeum, R. bromii, R. callidus, R. albus, Bifidobacterium longum, B. adolescentis, B. infantis, Eubacterium biforme, E. aerofaciens, Lactobacillus acidophilus,Escherichia coli, and Enterococcus faecium. The two universal primers were able to amplify full size 16S rDNA from all of the 20 bacterial species tested. The hybridization results indicated that the membrane-array method is a reliable technique for the detection of predominant human intestinal bacteria in the fecal samples. The result was also confirmed by using specific PCR methods for these bacteria.
TI  - Design and evaluation of oligonucleotide-microarray method for the detection of human intestinal bacteria in fecal samples.
AB  - An oligonucleotide-microarray method was developed for the detection of intestinal bacteria in fecal samples collected from human subjects. The 16S rDNA sequences of 20 predominant human intestinal bacterial species were used to design oligonucleotide probes. Three 40-mer oligonucleotides specific for each bacterial species (total 60 probes) were synthesized and applied to glass slides. Cyanine5 (CY5)-labeled 16S rDNAs were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from human fecal samples or bacterial DNA using two universal primers and were hybridized to the oligo-microarray. The 20 intestinal bacterial species tested were Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides vulgatus, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides distasonis, Clostridium clostridiiforme, Clostridium leptum, Fusobacterium prausnitzii, Peptostreptococcus productus, Ruminococcus obeum, Ruminococcus bromii, Ruminococcus callidus, Ruminococcus albus, Bifidobacterium longum, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Bifidobacterium infantis, Eubacterium biforme, Eubacterium aerofaciens, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Escherichia coli, and Enterococcus faecium. The two universal primers were able to amplify full size 16S rDNA from all of the 20 bacterial species tested. The hybridization results indicated that the oligo-microarray method developed in this study is a reliable method for the detection of predominant human intestinal bacteria in the fecal samples.
TI  - Pharmacodynamic properties of HMR 3004, a novel ketolide, on respiratory pathogens, enterococci and Bacteroides fragilis demonstrated by studies of time kill kinetics and postantibiotic effect.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The pharmacodynamic properties of the novel ketolide (a new class of macrolide) antibiotic, HMR 3004, were investigated by studying time-kill kinetics and postantibiotic effect. METHODS: The time-kill kinetics were studied at two inocula against three strains each of Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium and Bacteroides fragilis. The postantibiotic effects of HMR 3004 were also investigated on these organisms at concentrations equivalent to 1, 4 and 10 x MIC. RESULTS: The time kill-kinetic data demonstrated that HMR 3004 is inoculum dependent and predominantly bacteriostatic being only slowly bactericidal at higher concentrations. HMR 3004 exhibited a significant postantibiotic effect with all strains studied, ranging from 1.9--6.2 h at 10 x MIC. CONCLUSIONS: The bacteriostatic activity and significant postantibiotic effect demonstrated by HMR 3004 are similar to those previously obtained with other macrolides.
TI  - In vivo efficacy of trovafloxacin against Bacteroides fragilis in mixed infection with either Escherichia coli or a vancomycin-resistant strain of Enterococcus faecium in an established-abscess murine model.
AB  - The pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties of trovafloxacin were studied  in a standardized murine model of established subcutaneous abscesses. Daily dosing regimens of 37.5 to 300 mg/kg every 8 h (q8h) or every 24 h (q24h) were started 3 days after inoculation with mixtures containing either Bacteroides fragilis-Escherichia coli-autoclaved cecal contents (ACC) or B. fragilis-vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREF)-ACC. Treatment was continued for 3 or 5 days. The efficacy of treatment was determined by the decrease in abscess bacterial counts and abscess weights, as well as by the reduction in inflammation (biodistribution of (99m)Tc-HYNIC immunoglobulin G) compared to saline-treated controls. Trovafloxacin showed a significant dose-response effect on the bacterial counts, weight, and inflammation of B. fragilis-E. coli abscesses after 3 and/or 5 days of treatment. A maximum 3.4 and 3.1 log(10) reduction in CFU/abscess in the respective B. fragilis and E. coli bacterial counts was attained after 5 days of treatment with daily doses of 300 mg/kg. The peak serum concentration was more predictive for effect than the area under the concentration-time curve. The C(max) was the pharmacodynamic index most predictive for success, and the efficacy of the q24h regimens was significantly better than the q8h regimens. The antibiotic was ineffective against the VREF in mixed infection with B. fragilis, while the killing of the anaerobe in the same combination was significantly less than in the E. coli combination (P < 0.05). We conclude that this is a useful model for studying the activity of antimicrobials for the treatment of small (<1-cm), undrainable, mixed-infection abscesses. In addition, we have shown for the first time that a decrease in bacterial numbers also leads to a reduction in both abscess weight and inflammation.
TI  - In vitro activity of trovafloxacin against Bacteroides fragilis in mixed culture  with either Escherichia coli or a vancomycin- resistant strain of Enterococcus faecium determined by an anaerobic time-kill technique.
AB  - To determine the efficacy of trovafloxacin as a possible treatment for intra-abdominal abscesses, we have developed an anaerobic time-kill technique using different inocula to study the in vitro killing of Bacteroides fragilis in pure culture or in mixed culture with either Escherichia coli or a vancomycin-resistant strain of Enterococcus faecium (VREF). With inocula of 5 x 10(5) CFU/ml and trovafloxacin concentrations of </=2 microg/ml, a maximum observed effect (E(max)) of >/=6.1 (log(10) CFU/ml) was attained with all pure and mixed cultures within 24 h. With inocula of 10(8) CFU/ml, a similar E(max) and a similar concentration to produce 50% of E(max) (EC(50)) for B. fragilis were found in both pure cultures and mixed cultures with E. coli. However, to produce a similar killing of B. fragilis in the mixed cultures with VREF, a 14-fold increase in the concentration of trovafloxacin was required. A vancomycin-susceptible strain of E. faecium and a trovafloxacin-resistant strain of E. coli were also found to confer a similar "protective" effect on B. fragilis against the activity of trovafloxacin. Using inocula of 10(9) CFU/ml, the activity of trovafloxacin was retained for E. coli and B. fragilis and was negligible against VREF. We conclude that this is a useful technique to study the anaerobic killing of mixed cultures in vitro and may be of value in predicting the killing of mixed infections in vivo. The importance of using mixed cultures and not pure cultures is clearly shown by the difference in the killing of B. fragilis in the mixed cultures tested. Trovafloxacin will probably be ineffective in the treatment of infections involving large numbers of enterococci. However, due to its ability to retain activity against large cultures of B. fragilis and E. coli, trovafloxacin could be beneficial in the treatment of intra-abdominal abscesses.
TI  - Bacterial pathogens induce abscess formation by CD4(+) T-cell activation via the  CD28-B7-2 costimulatory pathway.
AB  - Abscesses are a classic host response to infection by many pathogenic bacteria. The immunopathogenesis of this tissue response to infection has not been fully elucidated. Previous studies have suggested that T cells are involved in the pathologic process, but the role of these cells remains unclear. To delineate the mechanism by which T cells mediate abscess formation associated with intra-abdominal sepsis, the role of T-cell activation and the contribution of antigen-presenting cells via CD28-B7 costimulation were investigated. T cells activated in vitro by zwitterionic bacterial polysaccharides (Zps) known to induce abscess formation required CD28-B7 costimulation and, when adoptively transferred to the peritoneal cavity of naive rats, promoted abscess formation. Blockade of T-cell activation via the CD28-B7 pathway in animals with CTLA4Ig prevented abscess formation following challenge with different bacterial pathogens, including Staphylococcus aureus, Bacteroides fragilis, and a combination of Enterococcus faecium and Bacteroides distasonis. In contrast, these animals had an increased abscess rate following in vivo T-cell activation via CD28 signaling. Abscess formation in vivo and T-cell activation in vitro required costimulation by B7-2 but not B7-1. These results demonstrate that abscess formation by pathogenic bacteria is under the control of a common effector mechanism that requires T-cell activation via the CD28-B7-2 pathway.
TI  - Linezolid.
AB  - Linezolid is an oxazolidinone antibacterial agent that acts by inhibiting the initiation of bacterial protein synthesis. Cross-resistance between linezolid and other inhibitors of protein synthesis has not been demonstrated. Linezolid has a wide spectrum of activity against gram-positive organisms including methicillin-resistant staphylococci, penicillin-resistant pneumococci and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium. Anerobes such as Clostridium spp., Peptostreptococcus spp. and Prevotella spp. are also susceptible to linezolid. Linezolid is bacteriostatic against most susceptible organisms but displays bactericidal activity against some strains of pneumococci, Bacteroides fragilis and C. perfringens. In clinical trials involving hospitalised patients with skin/soft tissue infections (predominantly S. aureus), intravenous/oral linezolid (up to 1250 mg mg/day) produced clinical success in >83% of individuals. In patients with community-acquired pneumonia, success rates were >94%. Preliminary clinical data also indicate that twice daily intravenous/oral linezolid 600 mg is as effective as intravenous vancomycin 1 g in the treatment of patients with hospital-acquired pneumonia and in those with infections caused by methicillin-resistant staphylococci. Moreover, linezolid 600 mg twice daily produced >85% clinical/microbiological cure in vancomycin-resistant enterococcal infections. Linezolid is generally well tolerated and gastrointestinal disturbances are the most commonly occurring adverse events. No clinical evidence of adverse reactions as a result of monoamine oxidase inhibition has been reported.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial spectrum of a new broad-spectrum 8-methoxy fluoroquinolone, gatifloxacin.
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial spectrum of gatifloxacin was compared with those of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. Gatifloxacin was two- to four-fold more potent than comparator quinolones against staphylococci, streptococci, pneumococci and enterococci (gatifloxacin MIC90s, < or =1 mg/L, except 4 mg/L against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecium). Gatifloxacin was two-fold less potent than ciprofloxacin, and the same as or two-fold more potent than ofloxacin against Enterobacteriaceae (MIC90s, 0.06-0.5 mg/L against most members of the Enterobacteriaceae and < or =1 mg/L against Proteus/Morganella spp.). Relative to the comparator quinolones, gatifloxacin was two- to four-fold more potent against Providencia spp., and had good potency against Acinetobacter spp. (MIC90s, 0.25-1 mg/L). Gatifloxacin and ofloxacin had similar anti-pseudomonal potency, with corresponding MIC90s of 4, 8 and 0.25 mg/L for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas fluorescens and Pseudomonas stutzeri, while ciprofloxacin had two- to eight-fold more potency. The three quinolones were equipotent against Burkholderia cepacia (MIC90s, 8 mg/L), but gatifloxacin was two-fold more potent against Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (MIC90, 4 mg/L). Gatifloxacin was highly potent (MIC90s, 0.03-0.06 mg/L) against Haemophilus influenzae, Legionella spp., Helicobacter pylori and had at least eight-fold better anti-chlamydial and anti-mycoplasma potency (gatifloxacin MIC90s, 0.13 mg/L). The higher quinolone MICs for ureaplasma (MIC90s, 4-8 mg/L) may be due to the acidic pH of the ureaplasma test medium, which antagonizes quinolones. Like other quinolones, gatifloxacin had poor potency against Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare, though it was eight- to 16-fold more potent against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MIC90, 0.25 mg/L). Of the three quinolones, only gatifloxacin had activity against Bacteroides fragilis and Clostridium difficile. In summary, gatifloxacin is a broad-spectrum 8-methoxy fluoroquinolone that is more potent than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin against Gram-positive bacteria, chlamydia, mycoplasma, mycobacteria and anaerobes.
TI  - The in-vitro activity of HMR 3647, a new ketolide antimicrobial agent.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of HMR 3647, a novel ketolide, was investigated in comparison with those of erythromycin A, roxithromycin, clarithromycin (14-membered ring macrolides), amoxycillin-clavulanate and ciprofloxacin against 719 recent clinical Gram-positive, Gram-negative and anaerobic isolates and type cultures. HMR 3647 generally demonstrated greater activity than the other compounds with MIC90s of < or =0.5 mg/L, except for Staphylococcus epidermidis (MIC90 > 128 mg/L), Haemophilus influenzae (MIC90 = 2 mg/L), Enterococcus faecalis (MIC90 = 2 mg/L), Enterococcus faecium (MIC90 = 1 mg/L) and the anaerobes, Bacteroides fragilis (MIC90 = 2 mg/L) and Clostridium difficile (MIC90 = 1 mg/L). In general, an increase in the size of the inoculum from 10(4) to 10(6) cfu on selected strains had little effect on the MICs of HMR 3647. Additionally, the in-vitro activity of HMR 3647 was not affected by the presence of either 20 or 70% (v/v) human serum. The antichlamydial activity of HMR 3647 was generally greater than that of commonly used antichlamydial antimicrobials.
TI  - Pharmacodynamic properties of HMR 3647, a novel ketolide, on respiratory pathogens, enterococci and Bacteroides fragilis demonstrated by studies of time-kill kinetics and postantibiotic effect.
AB  - The pharmacodynamic properties of a novel ketolide (a new class of macrolide), HMR 3647, were investigated by studying time-kill kinetics and postantibiotic effect (PAE). The time-kill kinetics were studied at two inocula against three strains each of Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium and Bacteroides fragilis. The PAEs of HMR 3647 were also investigated on these organisms at concentrations equivalent to 1, 4 and 10 x MIC. The time-kill kinetic data demonstrated that HMR 3647 is predominantly bacteriostatic and only slowly bactericidal at higher concentrations. HMR 3647 exhibited a significant PAE with all strains studied, ranging from 1.2 h to 8.2 h at 10 x MIC. The bacteriostatic activity and significant PAE demonstrated by HMR 3647 are similar to those previously obtained with other macrolides.
TI  - Antimicrobial characteristics of quinupristin/dalfopristin (Synercid at 30:70 ratio) compared to alternative ratios for in vitro testing.
AB  - Quinupristin/dalfopristin is a new streptogramin combination that occurs at a natural ratio and formulation of 30:70. Rapid metabolism of the dalfopristin component to RP 12536 in vivo puts in question the validity of in vitro test of spectrum with the parent combination. In studies of quinupristin with both dalfopristin and RP 12536, a wide range of ratios (30:70, 50:50, 70:30) were tested by reference MIC and MBC tests. No significant potency differences were observed between combination ratios or metabolic components when testing 256 bacterial strains. Quinupristin/dalfopristin or quinupristin/RP 12536 remained active, by bactericidal action against many staphylococci and Streptococcus ssp. Enterococcus faecium strains were susceptible (MIC90, 2 micrograms/ml; static effect only) to the streptogramin, but E. faecalis, Pasteurella multocida, Pediococcus ssp., Haemophilus influenzae, and Bacteroides fragilis were generally less susceptible (MIC90, > or = 8 micrograms/ml). The log phase inoculum was preferred for MBC and kill-curve tests with this combination. The 30:70 ratio in vitro susceptibility test of quinupristin/dalfopristin as used to date, seems to predict the potency and spectrum of this streptogramin accurately and all clinically important in vivo ratios of the injectable form or its major metabolites. Quinupristin/dalfopristin should be further investigated for clinical use against emerging resistant Gram-positive infections, especially penicillin-resistant streptococci and glycopeptide-resistant E. faecium that exhibit susceptibility in this investigation.
TI  - In vivo activities of U-100592 and U-100766, novel oxazolidinone antimicrobial agents, against experimental bacterial infections.
AB  - The Upjohn oxazolidinones, U-100592 and U-100766, are orally bioavailable synthetic antimicrobial agents with spectra of activity against antibiotic-susceptible and -resistant gram-positive pathogens. In several mouse models of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection, U-100592 and U-100766 yielded oral 50% effective doses (ED50) ranging from 1.9 to 8.0 mg/kg of body weight, which compared favorably with vancomycin subcutaneous ED50 values of 1.1 to 4.4 mg/kg. Similarly, both compounds were active versus a Staphylococcus epidermidis experimental systemic infection. U-100592 and U-100766 effectively cured an Enterococcus faecalis systemic infection, with ED50 values of 1.3 and 10.0 mg/kg, and versus a vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium infection in immunocompromised mice, both drugs effected cures at 12.5 and 24.0 mg/kg. Both compounds were exceptionally active in vivo against penicillin- and cephalosporin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, with ED50 values ranging from 1.2 to 11.7 mg/kg in systemic infection models. In soft tissue infection models with S. aureus and E. faecalis, both compounds exhibited acceptable curative activities in the range of 11.0 to 39.0 mg/kg. U-100766 was also very active versus the Bacteroides fragilis soft tissue infection model (ED50 = 46.3 mg/kg). In combination-therapy studies, both U-100592 and U-100766 were indifferent or additive in vivo against a monomicrobic S. aureus infection in combination with other antibiotics active against gram-positive bacteria and combined as readily as vancomycin with gentamicin in the treatment of a polymicrobic S. aureus-Escherichia coli infection. U-100592 and U-100766 are potent oxazolidinones active against antibiotic-susceptible and -resistant gram-positive pathogens in experimental systemic and soft tissue infections.
TI  - In vitro activities of U-100592 and U-100766, novel oxazolidinone antibacterial agents.
AB  - Oxazolidinones make up a relatively new class of antimicrobial agents which possess a unique mechanism of bacterial protein synthesis inhibition. U-100592 (S)-N-[[3-[3-fluoro-4-[4-(hydroxyacetyl)-1-piperazinyl]- phenyl]-2-oxo-5-oxazolidinyl]methyl]-acetamide and U-100766 (S)-N-[[3-[3-fluoro-4-(4-morpholinyl)phenyl]- 2-oxo-5-oxazolidinyl]methyl]-acetamide are novel oxazolidinone analogs from a directed chemical modification program. MICs were determined for a variety of bacterial clinical isolates; the respective MICs of U-100592 and U-100766 at which 90% of isolates are inhibited were as follows: methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, 4 and 4 micrograms/ml; methicillin-resistant S. aureus, 4 and 4 micrograms/ml; methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus epidermidis, 2 and 2 micrograms/ml; methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis, 1 and 2 micrograms/ml; Enterococcus faecalis, 2 and 4 micrograms/ml; Enterococcus faecium, 2 and 4 micrograms/ml; Streptococcus pyogenes, 1 and 2 micrograms/ml; Streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.50 and 1 microgram/ml; Corynebacterium spp., 0.50 and 0.50 micrograms/ml; Moraxella catarrhalis, 4 and 4 micrograms/ml; Listeria monocytogenes, 8 and 2 micrograms/ml; and Bacteroides fragilis, 16 and 4 micrograms/ml. Most strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and the gram-positive anaerobes were inhibited in the range of 0.50 to 2 micrograms/ml. Enterococcal strains resistant to vancomycin (VanA, VanB, and VanC resistance phenotypes), pneumococcal strains resistant to penicillin, and M. tuberculosis strains resistant to common antitubercular agents (isoniazid, streptomycin, rifampin, ethionamide, and ethambutol) were not cross-resistant to the oxazolidinones. The presence of 10, 20, and 40% pooled human serum did not affect the antibacterial activities of the oxazolidinones. Time-kill studies demonstrated a bacteriostatic effect of the analogs against staphylococci and enterococci but a bactericidal effect against streptococci. The spontaneous mutation frequencies of S. aureus ATCC 29213 were <3.8 x 10(-10) and <8 x 10(-11) for U-100592 and U-100766, respectively. Serial transfer of three staphylococcal and two enterococcal strains on drug gradient plates produced no evidence of rapid resistance development. Thus, these new oxazolidinone analogs demonstrated in vitro antibacterial activities against a variety of clinically important human pathogens.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin. Rationale for clinical use.
AB  - Most Gram-positive organisms are highly susceptible to the streptogramin, quinupristin/dalfopristin (RP 59500; Synercid). Minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of isolates (MIC90) were < or = 1 mg/L for Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, S. haemolyticus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes and Listeria monocytogenes. Importantly, quinupristin/dalfopristin shows similar activity against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains of S. aureus, and streptococci with benzylpenicillin (penicillin G)- or erythromycin-acquired resistance. Enterococci have varying susceptibility to quinupristin /dalfopristin, although most isolates tested are susceptible to the drug, including vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant Enterococcus faecium. E. faecalis are generally the least susceptible. Among the Gram-negative respiratory pathogens Moraxella catarrhalis is susceptible and Haemophilus influenzae is moderately susceptible to quinupristin/ dalfopristin; however, Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. are resistant. The drug is active against anaerobic organisms tested, including Clostridium perfringens, Lactobacillus spp., Bacteroides fragilis and Peptostreptococcus. Synergy has been demonstrated in vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant E. faecium, and methicillin-sensitive and -resistant S. aureus with the combination of vancomycin and quinupristin/ dalfopristin. Quinupristin/dalfopristin shows antibacterial activity in vivo in animal models of infection, including methicillin-sensitive and -resistant S. aureus infection in rabbits, S. aureus and S. pneumoniae in mice, and erythromycin-sensitive and -resistant viridans group streptococci infections in rats. The drug is rapidly bactericidal against Gram-positive organisms (with the exception of enterococci) at concentrations similar to or within 4-fold of the MIC, and it has a long postantibiotic effect both in vitro and in vivo.
TI  - In vitro activity of WY-49605, a penem antimicrobial.
AB  - The in vitro activity of the penem antimicrobial WY-49605 was compared with those of other agents available for oral administration. Based on concentrations inhibiting 90% of isolates (MIC(90)s), the penem inhibited methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (MIC(90) = 0.25 microg/ml), penicillin-susceptible streptococci (MIC(90) < or = 0.12 microg/ml) and several other Gram-positive genera at concentrations comparable or superior to the most active comparison agents. WY-49605 and cefpodoxime were the most active agents against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae. Most strains of Enterococcus faecalis and Bacteroides fragilis were susceptible to the new agent at concentrations < or =4microg/ml, while Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecium, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus were resistant to all agents tested.
TI  - [Nationwide survey on susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents in 1991].
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical isolates to  different antibacterial agents at 123 hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1991. In this study, identifications and susceptibility testings were carried out at each hospital laboratory. The susceptibility testing were performed using the disk dilution method recommended by NCCLS. Staphylococcus aureus and CNS showed high or moderate resistance rates to methicillin (DMPPC). Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Proteus mirabilis were highly susceptible to many agents including beta-lactam antibiotics. Though Enterococcus faecalis was highly susceptible to ampicillin (ABPC), piperacillin (PIPC), imipenem (IPM), sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (ST) compounds, Enterococcus faecium was resistant to almost all antibacterial agents but to ST compounds. High susceptibility rates were observed for strains of Enterobacter cloacae to IPM, gentamicin (GM) and ofloxacin (OFLX) and for strains of Proteus vulgaris to latamoxef (LMOX), IPM, aztreonam (AZT), GM and OFLX. Serratia marcescens and Bacteroides fragilis group were highly susceptible only to IPM. Pseudomonas aeruginosa were sensitive to ceftazidime (CAZ), IPM, amikacin (AMK) and tobramycin (TOB). Pseudomonas cepacia was relatively susceptible only to CAZ. IPM showed strong antibacterial activity to many species except for S. aureus and CNS.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity and beta-lactamase stability of SY5555, a new oral penem antibiotic.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of SY5555, a new oral penem antibiotic, was compared with those of cefaclor, cefixime, and cefteram. SY5555 was more active than the comparison agents against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Morganella morganii, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Clostridium spp., and Bacteroides fragilis. Against Providencia spp., Proteus spp., and Haemophilus influenzae, SY5555 was less active than cefixime or cefteram. SY5555 was inactive against methicillin-resistant S. aureus. Enterococcus faecium, Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Xanthomonas maltophilia, as were the comparison agents. The bactericidal activities of SY5555, cefixime, and cefteram were at or slightly greater than the MICs for clinical isolates of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. SY5555 was not hydrolyzed by various types of beta-lactamases. However, SY5555 and the comparison agents were hydrolyzed by X. maltophilia (L-1) and P. aeruginosa/pMS354 beta-lactamases, two Bush group 3 beta-lactamases, SY5555 showed a high affinity, as did cefixime and cefteram, for cephalosporinases from C. freundii GN7391 and E. cloacae GN7471 strains. These results suggest that SY5555 may be more specific than existing beta-lactam antibiotics.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activities of aspoxicillin of fresh clinical isolates].
AB  - The Antimicrobial activity of aspoxicillin (ASPC) in terms of minimum inhibitory  concentration (MICs) was compared with those of other penicillin antibiotics (PCs) against clinical isolates sent to us from medical institutions throughout Japan in 1988, 1990 and 1992 and strains isolated and identified from samples collected from patients with various infections. 1. The MIC80's of ASPC against Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus spp., Escherichia coli, Bacteroides fragilis group were almost the same as those against these isolates in 1985 to 1986. 2. A trend for increasing susceptibility to PCs including ASPC was observed in the isolates of S. aureus and Haemophilus influenzae. This trend in S. aureus was attributed to the appearance of non beta-lactamase producing strains associated with the development of highly resistant strains among the methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) as well as to a tendency toward yearly decreasing frequency of MRSA. The trend for the increased susceptibility in H. influenzae was related to the decrease in the number of beta-lactamase production strains. 3. The frequency of the strains highly resistant to PCs including ASPC increased. 4. No PCs-resistant strains were observed among the so-called beta-streptococci, while among alpha-streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae there was a trend for decreasing frequency of strains with lower susceptibility to PCs or those with resistant to PCs. These strains may be variants which were also resistant to cephems and had penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). Meanwhile, a high frequency of highly PCs-resistant strains were noted among Enterococcus faecium. In view of the fact that the PCs-resistance of E. faecium is known to be related to PBPs, the pattern of the susceptibility of the recent clinical isolates to beta-lactams is considered to be multimodal.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance patterns in Korea.
AB  - Recent in-vitro test results showed that in Seoul (Korea) aerobic Gram-negative bacilli are often resistant to ampicillin and to the first-generation cephalosporins, but chloramphenicol-resistant Salmonella typhi are extremely rare. Almost all isolates of Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, 49% of Neisseria gonorrhoeae and 31% of Haemophilus influenzae were beta-lactamase producers. Seventhy-two percent of pneumococci were penicillin G resistant and 62% of staphylococci were methicillin resistant. Among the Enterococcus faecium, 59% were resistant to high-level gentamicin, but glycopeptide-resistant isolates were not found. Thirty-eight percent and 5% of Bacteroides fragilis were resistant to clindamycin and cefoxitin, respectively. In conclusion, antimicrobial-resistant bacteria are prevalent in Korea.
TI  - The activity of metal compounds against aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - We evaluated the antimicrobial activity of two metal compounds, JM-1397 (OsO2[xylyl]2) and JM-2469 (AuCl[S2CPEt3]). Both inhibited methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus at concentrations of 0.5-2 micrograms/ml, with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC90) of 1 microgram/ml for JM-1397 and 0.5 microgram/ml for JM-2469. Similar concentrations inhibited methicillin-susceptible and -resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (S. epidermidis, S. haemolyticus, and S. saprophyticus). JM-2469 inhibited group A, B, C, F, and G beta-hemolytic streptococci and viridans group streptococci at 1-8 micrograms/ml (MIC90 4 micrograms/ml) but Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium had MICs of 8-16 micrograms/ml. JM-1397 had MICs for these organisms of greater than 64 micrograms/ml. Bacteroides fragilis, other Bacteroides, and Clostridium species were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.12-4 micrograms/ml (MIC90, 0.5 microgram/ml). MICs of both compounds for Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas spp. were greater than 64 micrograms/ml. These studies show that osmium and gold compounds have potential as topical agents against Gram-positive and anaerobic species.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of ciprofloxacin against fresh clinical isolates from superficial suppurative foci].
AB  - The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 5 drugs (ciprofloxacin (CPFX), and 4 drugs used as standard) were determined to investigate antibacterial potencies of CPFX against bacterial strains isolated in 1989 from superficial suppurative foci. The clinical isolates tested included 375 strains from 11 aerobic bacterial species, and 50 strains from 2 anerobic bacterial genera (group) for a total of 425 isolates. Interpreting MIC level distributions of these drugs as the expression of antibacterial potencies, the results are as follows. 1. When activities of new-quinolone antibiotics were tested, we found that, CPFX expressed far superior antibacterial potency to ofloxacin (OFLX) and norfloxacin (NFLX) against coagulase-negative staphylococci, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Peptostreptococcus spp., although the activity of CPFX against Bacteroides fragilis group was weaker than that of OFLX, and CPFX had similar activity against Staphylococcus aureus to OFLX. 2. In comparison to beta-lactam antibiotics, CPFX was inferior to amoxicillin (AMPC) against E. faecalis and inferior to AMPC and cefaclor (CCL) against Peptostreptococcus spp. Against all other bacterial species, however, CPFX expressed superior antibacterial potency to AMPC and CCL. 3. Scattered findings of low sensitivity or resistance to CPFX were observed among the S. aureus, E. faecalis, E. faecium, P. vulgaris, M. morganii, P. aeruginosa and B. fragilis (group) species, but with an exception of E. faecium, the incidence of resistance strains was low.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents. A study mainly focused on imipenem. Reported by the Research Group for Testing Imipenem Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (IPM) and other antibacterial agents at 64 hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1988. In this study, identification and susceptibility testing were carried out at each laboratory and the tests were performed according to the disk dilution method recommended by NCCLS in which susceptibilities are classified into "S", "MS", "I" and "R". IPM showed markedly high in vitro activities against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Salmonella spp., Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia rettgeri, Providencia stuartii, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, Alcaligenes spp., Peptococcus spp./Peptostreptococcus spp., Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides spp. IPM also had strong activities against Achromobacter xylosoxidans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but less active against Flavobacterium spp., E. faecium, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas cepacia. In a study in which activities of IPM against bacteria isolated from different clinical sources were compared, differences in susceptibilities were observed among S. aureus, CNS, A. calcoaceticus and P. aeruginosa, but such differences were not apparent among S. pneumoniae, E. faecalis, H. influenzae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, C. freundii, S. marcescens or P. mirabilis.
TI  - Biological characterization of a new radioactive labeling reagent for bacterial penicillin-binding proteins.
AB  - Radiolabeled penicillin G is widely used as the imaging agent in penicillin-binding protein (PBP) assays. The disadvantages of most forms of labeled penicillin G are instability on storage and the long exposure times usually required for autoradiography or fluorography of electrophoretic gels. We investigated the utility of radioiodinated penicillin V as an alternative reagent. Radioiodination of p-(trimethylstannyl)penicillin V with [125I]Na, using a modification of the chloramine-T method, is simple, high yielding, and site specific. We demonstrated the general equivalence of commercially obtained [3H]penicillin G and locally synthesized [125I]penicillin V (IPV) in their recognition of bacterial PBPs. Profiles of PBPs in membranes from Bacteroides fragilis, Escherichia coli, Providencia rettgeri, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, and Enterococcus faecium labeled with IPV or [3H]penicillin G were virtually identical. Use of IPV as the imaging agent in competition experiments for determination of the affinities of various beta-lactam antibiotics for the PBPs of E. coli yielded results similar to those obtained in experiments with [3H]penicillin G. Dried electrophoretic gels from typical PBP experiments, using IPV at 37.3 Ci/mmol and 30 micrograms/ml, exposed X-ray film in 8 to 24 h. The stability of IPV on storage at 4 degrees C was inversely proportional to specific activity. At 37.3 Ci/mmol and 60 micrograms/ml, IPV retained useful activity for at least 60 days at 4 degrees C. IPV represents a practical and stable reagent for rapid PBP assays.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. A study mainly focused on ofloxacin (the second report). Reported by the Research Group for Testing ofloxacin Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - Susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (OFLX) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures throughout Japan between April, 1986 and March, 1987. The results were totalized with an emphasis mainly on OFLX and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. In this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. Similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to OFLX included Staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), Entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), Escherichia coli (4,097 strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), Enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), Enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), Citrobacter freundii (406 strains), Proteus mirabilis (613 strains), Morganella morganii (320 strains), Serratia marcescens (869 strains), Haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), Acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and Campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). Neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to OFLX was investigated with this species. As results, OFLX showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, E. aerogenes, C. freundii, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, H. influenzae, A. calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp., and C. jejuni. However, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. The following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: Streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), Streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), Enterococcus faecium (146 strains), Branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), Citrobacter diversus (128 strains), Klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), Proteus vulgaris (438 strains), Serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), Pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), Pseudomonas putida (154 strains), Xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), Vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), Bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),
TI  - Norfloxacin binds to human fecal material.
AB  - Earlier studies have reported very high (120 to 2,700 mg/kg) concentrations of norfloxacin in feces after therapeutic doses. MICs for fecal microorganisms are with few exceptions far below these levels. Nevertheless, clinical investigations show that the main part of the aerobic gram-positive and the anaerobic microflora remains unaffected after norfloxacin administration. In this study, the binding of [14C]norfloxacin to fecal material was analyzed. The binding of a group of nonlabeled quinolones to feces and the interactions between Enterococcus faecium, Bacteroides fragilis, and norfloxacin were also investigated. The results showed that norfloxacin has the ability to bind to feces. The specific binding was reversible, saturated after 90 min of incubation at 37 degrees C, and increased linearly with fecal concentration. Scatchard plots and nonlinear regression computer analyses revealed two different binding classes. The primary specific binding had a dissociation constant (KD) of 1.0 microM and a maximal binding capacity (Bmax) of 0.12 mumol/g of feces. The KD and Bmax of the secondary, more unspecific binding were 450 microM and 11.8 mumol/g of feces, respectively. The binding of unlabeled ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, ofloxacin, pefloxacin, and norfloxacin to feces was comparable to that of [14C]norfloxacin. The results of norfloxacin binding to suspensions of B. fragilis suggested that the main part of the binding is to the bacterial fraction of feces. In the presence of 8.0 g (dry weight) of B. fragilis per liter, the MBC of norfloxacin for E. faecium increased from 8 to 256 micrograms/ml. The finding of the present study indicated that binding of norfloxacin to feces may explain the paradox of high fecal concentrations of norfloxacin versus the actual effect on the normal gastrointestinal microflora.
TI  - Comparative in-vitro activity of erythromycin, vancomycin and pristinamycin.
AB  - We have studied the in-vitro activity of erythromycin, vancomycin and pristinamycin against 1,006 clinical isolates comprising streptococci, staphylococci, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Haemophilus influenzae and anaerobes. In-vitro studies show pristinamycin to inhibit staphylococci and streptococci, including erythromycin highly-resistant organisms, at a concentration of less than or equal to 0.78 mg/l. Although pristinamycin's mean MIC for streptococci is higher than that of erythromycin, pristinamycin is bactericidal, whereas erythromycin is bacteristatic against Streptococcus agalactiae and oral streptococci. Enterococci were less uniformly susceptible to pristinamycin: 58 of the 94 Enterococcus faecalis tested were resistant (MIC greater than or equal to 3.12 mg/l). 14 of the 15 isolates of Enterococcus faecium were inhibited by less than or equal to 1.56 mg/l pristinamycin. Pristinamycin showed poor activity against Haemophilus influenzae (mode MIC 1.56 and MIC90 of 3.12 mg/l) but all except two of the 100 Neisseria gonorrhoeae tested were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.78 mg/l pristinamycin. Pristinamycin inhibited all nine Clostridium spp. at less than or equal to 0.39 mg/l and 38 of 40 strains of anaerobic gram-positive cocci at less than or equal to 0.78 mg/l. It was less effective against the Bacteroides fragilis group: (MIC90 3.12 mg/l). Pristinamycin had poor bactericidal activity against the anaerobes tested.
