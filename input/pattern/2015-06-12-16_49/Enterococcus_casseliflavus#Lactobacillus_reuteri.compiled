TI  - Animal rennets as sources of dairy lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The microbial composition of artisan and industrial animal rennet pastes was studied by using both culture-dependent and -independent approaches. Pyrosequencing targeting the 16S rRNA gene allowed to identify 361 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) to the genus/species level. Among lactic acid bacteria (LAB), Streptococcus thermophilus and some lactobacilli, mainly Lactobacillus crispatus and Lactobacillus reuteri, were the most abundant species, with differences among the samples. Twelve groups of microorganisms were targeted by viable plate counts revealing a dominance of mesophilic cocci. All rennets were able to acidify ultrahigh-temperature-processed (UHT) milk as shown by pH and total titratable acidity (TTA). Presumptive LAB isolated at the highest dilutions of acidified milks were phenotypically characterized, grouped, differentiated at the strain level by randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)-PCR analysis, and subjected to 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Only 18 strains were clearly identified at the species level, as Enterococcus casseliflavus, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus lactis, Lactobacillus delbrueckii, and Streptococcus thermophilus, while the other strains, all belonging to the genus Enterococcus, could not be allotted into any previously described species. The phylogenetic analysis showed that these strains might represent different unknown species. All strains were evaluated for their dairy technological performances. All isolates produced diacetyl, and 10 of them produced a rapid pH drop in milk, but only 3 isolates were also autolytic. This work showed that animal rennet pastes can be sources of LAB, mainly enterococci, that might contribute to the microbial diversity associated with dairy productions.
TI  - Presence of erythromycin and tetracycline resistance genes in lactic acid bacteria from fermented foods of Indian origin.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) resistant to erythromycin were isolated from different food samples on selective media. The isolates were identified as Enterococcus durans, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus lactis, Enterococcus casseliflavus, Lactobacillus salivarius, Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus fermentum, Pediococcus pentosaceus and Leuconostoc mesenteroides. Of the total 60 isolates, 88 % harbored the ermB gene. The efflux gene msrA was identified in E. faecium, E. durans, E. lactis, E. casseliflavus, P. pentosaceus and L. fermentum. Further analysis of the msrA gene by sequencing suggested its homology to msrC. Resistance to tetracycline due to the genes tetM, tetW, tetO, tetK and tetL, alone or in combination, were identified in Lactobacillus species. The tetracycline efflux genes tetK and tetL occurred in P. pentosaceus and Enterococcus species. Since it appeared that LAB had acquired these genes, fermented foods may be a source of antibiotic resistance.
