TI  == effectiveness of the two microorganisms lactobacillus fermentum lf15 and lactobacillus plantarum lp01, formulated in slow-release vaginal tablets, in women affected by bacterial vaginosis: a pilot study.
AB  == background: bacterial vaginosis (bv) is the most common reason for abnormal vaginal discharge in reproductive-age women and one of its most important causative agents is the gram-variable bacterium gardnerella vaginalis. bv is not  accompanied by significant local inflammation, whereas the "fishy odor" test is always positive. in contrast, aerobic vaginitis (av) is predominantly associated  with escherichia coli, but streptococcus agalactiae and staphylococcus aureus are also involved. standard treatment of bv consists of oral or intravaginal antibiotics, although these are unable to spontaneously restore normal flora characterized by a high concentration of lactobacilli. the main limitation is the inability to offer a long-term defensive barrier, thus facilitating relapses and  recurrences. this study was undertaken firstly to assess the ability of selected  lactobacilli to in vitro antagonize g. vaginalis to determine an association with a strain able to inhibit e. coli, thus identifying a possible use in av. the second step of the study was to conduct a human pilot trial in women affected by  bv using an association of the most promising and active bacteria. materials and  methods: for this purpose, neutralized supernatants of individual lactobacilli were tested at percentages ranging from 0.5% to 4% to determine their ability to  hinder the growth of g. vaginalis american type culture collection 10231. the bacterium that was able to exert the strongest inhibition was subsequently tested with lactobacillus plantarum lp01 in a human intervention, placebo-controlled, pilot trial involving 34 female subjects (aged between 18 and 50, mean 34.7+/-8.9, no menopausal women) diagnosed with bv. the 2 microorganisms lactobacillus fermentum lf15 (dsm 26955) and l. plantarum lp01 (lmg p-21021) were delivered to the vagina by means of slow-release vaginal tablets, also containing 50 mg of tara gum. the amount of each strain was 400 million live cells per dose. the women were instructed to apply a vaginal tablet once a day for 7 consecutive  nights, followed by 1 tablet every 3 nights for a further 3-week application (acute phase) and, finally, 1 tablet per week to maintain a long-term vaginal colonization against possible recurrences. a clinical examination was performed and the nugent score was quantified for each patient at enrollment (d0), after 28 days (d28), and at the end of the second month of relapse prevention (d56). a statistical comparison was made between d28, or d56, and d0, and between d56 and  d28 to quantify the efficacy against possible recurrences. results: l. fermentum  lf15 showed the strongest in vitro inhibitory activity towards g. vaginalis american type culture collection (atcc) 10231 after both 24 and 48 hours. in the  human trial, the 2 lactobacilli selected, namely l. fermentum lf15 and l. plantarum lp01, significantly reduced the nugent score below the threshold of 7 after 28 days in 22 patients of 24 in the active group (91.7%, p<0.001). eight women (33.3%) recorded a nugent score between 4 and 6, evidence of an intermediate situation, whereas the remaining 14 (58.3%) showed a score <4, therefore suggesting the restoration of physiological vaginal microbiota. at the  end of the second month, only 4 women registered a nugent score >7, definable as  bv (16.7%, p=0.065 compared with d28). in the placebo group, no significant differences were recorded at any time. conclusions: bv, also known as vaginal bacteriosis is the most common cause of vaginal infection in women of childbearing age. furthermore, bv is often asymptomatic as about 50% of women with this condition have no symptoms at all and the prevalence rate in apparently healthy women is around 10%. this study suggests the ability of the 2 strains l.  fermentum lf15 and l. plantarum lp01 to counteract acute gardnerella infections effectively and significantly improve the related uncomfortable symptoms in a very high percentage of women. this could be partially attributed to the presence of tara gum, which is able to create a mechanical barrier against gardnerella on  the surface of vaginal mucosa as a primary mechanism. furthermore, long-term physiological protection seems to be established, thanks to the integration of the 2 lactobacilli into the vaginal microbiota and to their adhesion to the epithelial cells of the mucosa. in the light of the additional in vitro inhibitory activity against e. coli, their prospective use in av could also prove interesting.

TI  == effects of hormonal contraception on vaginal flora.
AB  == background: the sector of the market that deals with contraception offers a long  list of different contraceptive methods. within the estroprogestinic choice, the  routes of administration are oral, transdermic and vaginal one. even though efficacy is comparable with these methods, secondary and adverse effects are directly involved in the acceptability of the method. study design: this was a prospective comparative study. during 1 year, we enrolled 60 asymptomatic women who voluntarily requested combined oral contraception (coc) or combined contraceptive vaginal ring (ccvr group). after a baseline study of vaginal milieu prior to starting hormonal contraception, we performed a follow-up. for each woman, we examined vaginal ph; quantification of leukocytes, lactobacilli, candida and cocci on saline microscopy fluid; gram stain with nugent score and the presence of vaginal infection [culture for trichomonas vaginalis, albicans and nonalbicans candida, group b streptococcus (gbs)]. results: at the end of follow-up, there was a little change of vaginal milieu in both groups. we noted an increase of lactobacilli in the ccvr users and an increase of gbs in coc users. conclusion: ccvr compared to coc users showed an increase of the number of lactobacilli in vaginal flora. it means that an increase of leukorrhea in that group could be protective in terms of prevention of vaginal imbalance/infection.

TI  == the lower genital tract microbiota in relation to cytokine-, slpi- and endotoxin  levels: application of checkerboard dna-dna hybridization (cdh).
AB  == in the present study the lower genital tract microbiota in asymptomatic fertile women (n=34) was identified and quantified by culturing vaginal secretions. also, vaginal and cervical samples were analyzed by a semiquantitative checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique (cdh) based on genomic probes prepared from 13 bacterial species (bacteroides ureolyticus, escherichia coli, fusobacterium nucleatum, gardnerella vaginalis, mobiluncus curtisii ss curtisii, prevotella bivia, prevotella disiens, prevotella melaninogenica, atopobium vaginae, lactobacillus iners, staphylococcus aureus ss aureus, streptococcus anginosus, and streptococcus agalactiae). the bacterial species found by either culture or cdh were correlated with proinflammatory cytokines (il-1 alpha, il-1 beta, il-6,  il-8), secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (slpi), and endotoxin in the cervicovaginal samples. grading the women into healthy, intermediate, or bacterial vaginosis (bv) as based on gram staining of vaginal smears, the viable  counts of lactobacilli (l. gasseri) and of streptococci-staphylococci combined were highest in the intermediate group. in bv, particularly the high concentrations of actinomyces urogenitalis, atopobium vaginae, and peptoniphilus  harei were noted (>or=10(11) per ml). the total viable counts correlated with both cervical il-1 alpha and il-1 beta. a strong negative correlation was observed between l. iners and total viable counts, g. vaginalis, or cervical il-1 alpha, while it correlated positively with slpi. analysis of vaginal and cervical samples from 26 out of the 34 women by cdh showed that anaerobic bacteria were more frequently detected by cdh compared to culture. by this method, a. vaginae correlated with g. vaginalis, and l. iners with s. aureus. with regard to cytokines, b. ureolyticus correlated with both cervical and vaginal il-1 alpha as well as with cervical il-8, while f. nucleatum, s. agalactiae, s. anginosus, or s. aureus correlated with vaginal il-1 alpha. furthermore, all gram-negative bacteria taken together, as measured by cdh, correlated with vaginal endotoxin and inversely with vaginal slpi. the significance of the results is discussed. in summary, mapping of the identity and quantity of vaginal bacterial species and their association with locally produced host innate immune factors will help in defining various types of abnormal vaginal microbiota, developing new ways of assessing the risk of ascending subclinical infections, and in treating them. cdh appears to be a suitable tool for future analyses of large numbers of clinical samples with an extended number of bacterial probes.

TI  == nucleic acid-based diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis and improved management using probiotic lactobacilli.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis (bv) is a common condition in women that represents an imbalance of the vaginal microflora, lactobacilli depletion, and excess growth of mainly anaerobic gram-negative pathogens. diagnosis is made using a series of tests or a gram stain of a vaginal smear. treatment with antibiotics is quite effective, but recurrences are common. a study of 55 vaginal samples from 11 postmenopausal women showed the presence of bv by the gram stain-based nugent scoring system, and polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis showed that bacteroides or prevotella species were the most common isolates recovered (24 of 25), with escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus agalactiae also found in some samples. in one case, only gardnerella vaginalis was found. these findings illustrate that bv remains common even among otherwise healthy women, but it is not caused solely by either  gardnerella or mobiluncus. use of a femexam system (cooper surgical, shelton, ct), based upon elevated ph and trimethylamine levels, to screen vaginal smears from 59 healthy women showed poor correlation with the gram stain method. a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of these subjects showed that the lactobacilli-dominant microbiota was restored in subjects with bv but not in controls, following 2 months of daily oral intake of lactobacillus rhamnosus gr-1 and lactobacillus fermentum rc-14. these studies show that nucleic acid-based methods are effective at identifying bacteria responsible for bv. if such methods could be used to develop a commercially available, self-use kit, women would be much better placed to take control of their own health, for example, using medicinal food or dietary supplement products such as the clinically proven probiotic strains l. rhamnosus gr-1 and l. fermentum rc-14.

TI  == in vitro antagonistic effect of lactobacillus on organisms associated with bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == objective: to assess antagonistic properties of lactobacillus strains isolated from the vaginas of healthy women as compared to the most common bacterial agents related to vaginosis. study design: antagonistic activity of different lactobacillus strains isolated from the vaginas of healthy women not treated for  infections with an antibiotic for the previous three months was screened using an agar slab method. the activity was tested against test organisms associated with  bacterial vaginosis and/or urinary tract infections: staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, gardnerella vaginalis, peptostreptococcus anaerobius and prevotella bivia. results: many of the 146 lactobacillus strains tested exerted apparent antagonistic activities against gram-positive aerobic cocci and gram-negative rods, such as s aureus and  e coli, and a marked number of lactobacillus strains inhibited facultative bacteria, such as gardnerella vaginalis and the anaerobes p anaerobius and p bivia. only a few lactobacilli were able to inhibit growth of e faecalis and s agalactiae. indicator bacteria growth inhibition probably relies upon several different complementary mechanisms. the specific indicator bacteria species determines which mechanism predominates. conclusion: lactobacillus strains taken  from normal vaginal flora demonstrated antagonistic activity against a variety of bacteria related to vaginal and urinary tract infections. the specific occurrence rates of active lactobacillus strains are different, and this difference is dependent on the indicator bacteria species.

TI  == adherence of human vaginal lactobacilli to vaginal epithelial cells and interaction with uropathogens.
AB  == three strains of lactobacillus, identified as lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus gasseri, and lactobacillus jensenii, were selected from among 70 isolates from the vaginas of healthy premenopausal women for properties relevant  to mucosal colonization or antagonism. all three self-aggregated and adhered to epithelial vaginal cells, displacing well-known vaginal pathogens, such as g. vaginalis, and inhibiting the growth in vitro of escherichia coli and streptococcus agalactiae. the surface components involved in self-aggregation appeared to be proteins for l. gasseri and lipoproteins for l. acidophilus and l. jensenii, as judged by susceptibility to treatment with appropriate degrading enzymes. the factors responsible for adherence to epithelial vaginal cells seemed to be glycoproteins (l. acidophilus and l. gasseri) and carbohydrate (l. jensenii). the receptors of the vaginal cells were glycolipids, which presumably  were the targets of the competition observed between the lactobacilli and the pathogenic microbes.

TI  == epidemiology and outcomes associated with moderate to heavy candida colonization  during pregnancy. vaginal infections and prematurity study group.
AB  == objective: our purpose was to determine the risk factors, physical findings, microflora, and pregnancy outcome among pregnant women with moderate to heavy vaginal growth of candida albicans and other candida species. study design: a multicenter cohort of 13,914 women were enrolled between 23 and 26 weeks' gestation. women completed a questionnaire, underwent a physical examination, and had genital specimens taken for culture. a subset of 1459 women were reexamined during the third trimester. pregnancy outcomes were recorded at delivery. results: the prevalence of moderate to heavy candida colonization at midgestation was 10%. colonized women, 83% of whom carried c. albicans, were more likely to be black or hispanic, unmarried, a previous oral contraceptive user, and to manifest clinical signs indicative of candida carriage. candida colonization was positively associated with trichomonas vaginalis, group b streptococci, and aerobic lactobacillus and was not associated with adverse pregnancy outcome. conclusion: these results suggest that candida colonization is not associated with low birth weight or preterm delivery.

TI  == genetic basis of tetracycline resistance in urogenital bacteria.
AB  == the distributions of the nucleotide sequences related to the tetracycline resistance determinants tet k, tet l, tet m, and tet o were studied by dot blot hybridization with randomly chosen clinical urogenital tract isolates of viridans group streptococci, streptococcus agalactiae, enterococcus faecalis, gardnerella  vaginalis, lactobacillus spp., fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus spp.,  and veillonella parvula. among the peptostreptococcus spp., 79% of the isolates hybridized with one (64%) or more (36%) of the probes for tet k (27%), tet l (30%), tet m (75%) and tet o (13%). of the viridans group streptococci, 82% of the strains hybridized with one (34%) or more (66%) of the four probes. the distribution of the four determinants in this group was as follows: tet k, 36%; tet l, 31%; tet m, 43%; tet o, 61%. twenty-nine percent of the enterococci and forty-six percent of the group b streptococci hybridized with the probes; however, the tet k, tet l, and tet o determinants were found in only a few strains, while the tet m determinant predominated. a total of 29% of the f. nucleatum isolates, 55% of the g. vaginalis isolates, and 26% of the v. parvula isolates hybridized with the tet m determinant. in contrast, 43% of the lactobacillus spp. hybridized with the tet o determinant. the data indicate that  tetracycline resistance determinants are common to many of the microorganisms isolated from the urogenital tract.

TI  == adherence of trichomonas vaginalis to cell culture monolayers.
AB  == the in vitro adherence to wish cells of a pathogenic trichomonas vaginalis strain was studied with a method utilizing thymidine-labeled protozoa. a marked dose-related adherence was observed. glutaraldehyde fixed trichomonads were not adherent. the presence of fetal calf serum during the assay did not influence attachment. concanavalin a inhibited adherence of protozoa. complete or partial inhibition of adherence was achieved by preincubating wish cells with lactobacillus fermentum or streptococcus agalactiae. finally, pretreatment of cells with alpha-estradiol, beta-estradiol, progesterone and estrone influenced attachment of protozoa, whereas estriol was ineffective. these results suggest that adherence of trichomonas vaginalis is dependent on different factors, whose  manipulation may have clinical relevance in preventing recurrence of trichomonad  vaginitis.

TI  == vaginitis: current microbiologic and clinical concepts.
AB  == infectious vaginitis occurs when the normal vaginal flora is disrupted; it may arise when saprophytes overwhelm the host immune response, when pathogenic organisms are introduced into the vagina or when changes in substrate allow an imbalance of microorganisms to develop. examples of these types of vaginitis include the presence of chronic fungal infection in women with an inadequate cellular immune response to the yeast, the introduction of trichomonads into vaginal epithelium that has a sufficient supply of glycogen, and the alteration in bacterial flora, normally dominated by lactobacillus spp., and its metabolites that is characteristic of "nonspecific vaginitis". the authors review microbiologic and clinical aspects of the fungal, protozoal and bacterial infections, including the interactions of bacteria thought to produce nonspecific vaginitis, that are now recognized as causing vaginitis. other causes of vaginitis are also discussed.

TI  == comparison of bacterial and fungal adherence to vaginal exfoliated epithelial cells and human vaginal epithelial tissue culture cells.
AB  == the adherence of four bacterial species and candida albicans to a new in vitro tissue culture model of human vaginal stratified squamous epithelium was investigated and compared with in vitro adherence to vaginal exfoliated cells. gardnerella vaginalis, group b streptococci, lactobacillus sp., and c. albicans adhered well to both exfoliated and tissue culture cells. similarly, a piliated fecal isolate of escherichia coli, but not a nonpiliated vaginal isolate of e. coli, adhered well to both cell types. adherence of the piliated e. coli was markedly inhibited by preincubation of bacteria with d-mannose. no inhibition of  adherence by d-mannose of g. vaginalis, nonpiliated e. coli, and c. albicans was  demonstrated. scanning electron microscopy of tissue cultures showed nonuniform distribution of adherent microorganisms with diminished adherence in areas of active mitosis and proliferation and increased adherence to mature flat cells, often in the process of desquamation.

TI  == adherence of bacteria to vaginal epithelial cells at various times in the menstrual cycle.
AB  == adherence of vaginal isolates of escherichia coli, lactobacillus species, group b streptococci, gardnerella vaginalis and neisseria gonorrhoeae to exfoliated vaginal epithelial cells was studied in 10 healthy, sexually active medical students. studies were done pre- and postmenstrually and at midcycle for two consecutive menstrual cycles. the mean number of adherent bacteria per vaginal epithelial cell (range) was 3.4 (0 to 14) for e. coli, 60.5 (12 to 152) for lactobacillus species, 54.8 (21 to 76) for group b streptococci, 67.4 (15 to 161) for g. vaginalis, and 58.9 (15 to 186) diplococci for n. gonorrhoeae. adherence of g. vaginalis increased with increasing acidity of the test medium (ph 4 to 8). there were no significant differences in adherence to vaginal epithelial cells obtained at the various times in the menstrual cycle for any of the organisms (p  greater than 0.05). the pattern and extent of adherence among the women was similar for each organism. in this in vitro model, adherence characteristics did  not vary with the menstrual cycle.
