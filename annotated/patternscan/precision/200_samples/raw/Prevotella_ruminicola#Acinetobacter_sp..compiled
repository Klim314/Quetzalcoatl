TI  - Detection and identification of rumen bacteria constituting a fibrolytic consortium dominated by Fibrobacter succinogenes.
AB  - A fibrolytic consortium, dominated by the rumen cellulolytic bacterium Fibrobacter succinogenes, was artificially constructed on hay stems to detect and identify rumen bacteria that can potentially interact with F. succinogenes. Consortium-bacterial members were determined by DGGE and sequencing analysis targeted bacterial 16S rDNA. An artificial consortium was formed in a 2-step incubation of hay stems; the first step with group 1, 2 or 3 F. succinogenes strains, the second step with rumen fluid. After consortium formation, morphologically different bacteria were observed in association with F. succinogenes. DGGE exhibited more than 30 bands, the pattern of which depended on the F. succinogenes group. Sequencing suggested that Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, Pseudobutyrivibrio ruminis, Clostridium sp., F. succinogenes group 2, Prevotella ruminicola and unclassified Bacteroides were prominent in the group 1 consortium and that Treponema bryantii, B. fibrisolvens, Acinetobacter sp, and Wolinella succinogenes were prominent in the group 2 consortium. However, in the group 3 consortium, F. succinogenes-like bacteria were microscopically undetectable, whereas cellulolytic Ruminococcus albus and F. succinogenes group 1 were prominent, suggesting that the group 3 cannot be a core member of this consortium. This study is the first attempt to identify bacterial members of a fibrolytic consortium dominated by a specific bacterium.
