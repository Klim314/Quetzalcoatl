TI  == lactic acid microflora of the gut of snail .
AB  == the intestinal lactic acid microflora of the edible snail cornu aspersum was studied by culture-based methods and was phenotypically and molecularly characterized. the antibacterial activity of lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolates  was investigated. snails in different stages of development were collected from farms located in several regions of bulgaria. one hundred twenty-two isolates, belonging to the group of lab, were characterized morphologically and were divided into four groups. representative isolates from each morphological type were subjected to phenotypic characterization and molecular identification. the snail gut lactic acid microflora was composed by enterococcus (17 isolates), lactococcus (12 isolates), leuconostoc (7 isolates), lactobacillus (18 isolates)  and weissella (1 isolate). the species affiliation of lactococcus lactis (12), leuconostoc mesenteroides (4) and lactobacillus plantarum (2) was confirmed by species-specific primers. the lactobacillus isolates were identified by sequence  analysis of 16s rdna as lactobacillus brevis (12), l. plantarum (2), lactobacillus graminis (1) and lactobacillus curvatus (3). the species l. brevis, l. graminis and l. curvatus were found in snails in a phase of hibernation, whereas l. plantarum was identified both in active and hibernation phases. antibacterial activity (bacteriocine-like) was shown only by one strain of l. mesentereoides p4/8 against propionibacterium acnes. the present study showed that the lab are a component of the microbial communities in the snail digestive  system. this is the first report on lactobacillus strains detected in the gut of  c. aspersum.

TI  == construction of a shuttle vector based on the small cryptic plasmid pjy33 from weissella cibaria 33.
AB  == a cryptic plasmid, pjy33, from weissella cibaria 33 was characterized. pjy33 was  2365 bp in size with a gc content of 41.27% and contained two putative open reading frames (orfs). orf1 encoded a putative hypothetical protein of 134 amino  acids. orf2 was 849 bp in size, and its putative translation product exhibited 87% identity with a replication initiation factor from a plasmid from w. cibaria  klc140. a weissella-escherichia coli shuttle vector, pjy33e (6.5 kb, em(r)), was  constructed by ligation of pjy33 with pbluescript ii sk(-) and an erythromycin resistance gene (em(r)). pjy33e replicated in lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc citreum, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus plantarum, and weissella confusa. a  single-stranded dna intermediate was detected from lb. brevis 2.14 harbouring pjy33e, providing evidence for rolling-circle replication of pjy33. most lb. brevis 2.14 cells (85.9%) retained pjy33e after one week of daily culturing in mrs broth without em. an aga gene encoding alpha-galactosidase (alpha-gal) from leuconostoc mesenteroides was successfully expressed in lb. brevis 2.14 using pjy33e, and the highest level of alpha-gal activity (36.13 u/mg protein) was observed when cells were grown on melibiose.

TI  == microbiological and chemical characteristics of taruba, an indigenous beverage produced from solid cassava fermentation.
AB  == the aim of this work was to identify and characterize the microbiota present during fermentation and in the final beverage, taruba, by culture-dependent and -independent methods. in addition, target chemical compounds (carbohydrates, organic acids, and ethanol) were evaluated. lactic acid bacteria (lab) and mesophilic bacteria were the predominant microorganisms. among them, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus brevis, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and bacillus subtilis were frequently isolated and detected by dgge analysis. torulaspora delbrueckii was the dominant yeast species. yeast isolates pichia exigua, candida rugosa, t. delbrueckii, candida tropicalis, pichia kudriavzevii,  wickerhamomyces anomalus, and candida ethanolica and bacteria isolates lb. plantarum, bacillus subtilis, bacillus amyloliquefaciens, bacillus licheniformis, bacillus sp., and chitinophaga terrae showed amylolytic activity. only isolates of p. exigua and t. delbrueckii and all species of the genus bacillus identified  in this work exhibited proteolytic activity. all microbial isolates grew at 38 degrees c, and only the isolates belonging to hanseniaspora uvarum species did not grow at 42 degrees c. these characteristics are important for further development of starter cultures; isolates of t. delbrueckii, p. exigua, and bacillus species identified in this work displayed all of these properties and are potential strains for use as starter culture in cassava fermented food.

TI  == a competitive quantitative polymerase chain reaction method for characterizing the population dynamics during kimchi fermentation.
AB  == the aim of this study was to develop a competitive quantitative-pcr (cq-pcr) method for rapid analysis of the population dynamics of lactic acid bacteria (lab) in kimchi. for this, whole chromosome sequences of leuconostoc mesenteroides, lactobacillus plantarum, and lb. brevis were compared and species-specific pcr primers targeting dextransucrase, 16s rrna, and surface layer protein d (slpd) genes, respectively, were constructed. the tested strains  were quantified both in medium and kimchi by cq-pcr and the results were compared with the data obtained using a conventional plate-counting method. as a result, the three species were successfully detected and quantified by the indicated primer sets. our results show that the cq-pcr method targeting species-specific genes is suitable for rapid estimation of lab population to be used in the food fermentation industry.

TI  == fermented fruits and vegetables of asia: a potential source of probiotics.
AB  == as world population increases, lactic acid fermentation is expected to become an  important role in preserving fresh vegetables, fruits, and other food items for feeding humanity in developing countries. however, several fermented fruits and vegetables products (sauerkraut, kimchi, gundruk, khalpi, sinki, etc.) have a long history in human nutrition from ancient ages and are associated with the several social aspects of different communities. among the food items, fruits and vegetables are easily perishable commodities due to their high water activity and nutritive values. these conditions are more critical in tropical and subtropical  countries which favour the growth of spoilage causing microorganisms. lactic acid fermentation increases shelf life of fruits and vegetables and also enhances several beneficial properties, including nutritive value and flavours, and reduces toxicity. fermented fruits and vegetables can be used as a potential source of probiotics as they harbour several lactic acid bacteria such as lactobacillus plantarum, l. pentosus, l. brevis, l. acidophilus, l. fermentum, leuconostoc fallax, and l. mesenteroides. as a whole, the traditionally fermented fruits and vegetables not only serve as food supplements but also attribute towards health benefits. this review aims to describe some important asian fermented fruits and vegetables and their significance as a potential source of probiotics.

TI  == hydroxycinnamic acids used as external acceptors of electrons: an energetic advantage for strictly heterofermentative lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the metabolism of hydroxycinnamic acids by strictly heterofermentative lactic acid bacteria (19 strains) was investigated as a potential alternative energy route. lactobacillus curvatus pe5 was the most tolerant to hydroxycinnamic acids, followed by strains of weissella spp., lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus fermentum, and leuconostoc mesenteroides, for which the mic values were the same. the highest sensitivity was found for lactobacillus rossiae strains. during growth in mrs broth, lactic acid bacteria reduced caffeic, p-coumaric, and ferulic acids into dihydrocaffeic, phloretic, and dihydroferulic acids, respectively, or decarboxylated hydroxycinnamic acids into the corresponding vinyl derivatives and then reduced the latter compounds to ethyl compounds. reductase activities mainly emerged, and the activities of selected strains were  further investigated in chemically defined basal medium (cdm) under anaerobic conditions. the end products of carbon metabolism were quantified, as were the levels of intracellular atp and the nad(+)/nadh ratio. electron and carbon balances and theoretical atp/glucose yields were also estimated. when cdm was supplemented with hydroxycinnamic acids, the synthesis of ethanol decreased and the concentration of acetic acid increased. the levels of these metabolites reflected on the alcohol dehydrogenase and acetate kinase activities. overall, some biochemical traits distinguished the common metabolism of strictly heterofermentative strains: main reductase activity toward hydroxycinnamic acids, a shift from alcohol dehydrogenase to acetate kinase activities, an increase in the nad(+)/nadh ratio, and the accumulation of supplementary intracellular atp. taken together, the above-described metabolic responses suggest that strictly heterofermentative lactic acid bacteria mainly use hydroxycinnamic acids as external acceptors of electrons.

TI  == use of sourdough fermentation and mixture of wheat, chickpea, lentil and bean flours for enhancing the nutritional, texture and sensory characteristics of white bread.
AB  == this study aimed at investigating the addition of legume (chickpea, lentil and bean) flours to wheat flour bread. type i sourdough containing legumes or wheat-legume flours were prepared and propagated (back slopped) in laboratory, according to traditional protocols that are routinely used for making typical italian breads. based on kinetic of acidification and culture-dependent data, the wheat-legume sourdough was further characterized and selected for bread making. as determined by rapd-pcr and partial sequencing of 16s rdna gene analyses, lactic acid bacteria in wheat-legume sourdough included lactobacillus plantarum,  lactobacillus sanfranciscensis, leuconostoc mesenteroides, lactobacillus fermentum, weissella cibaria, lactobacillus pentosus, lactobacillus coryneformis, lactobacillus rossiae, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus parabuchneri and lactobacillus paraplantarum. two breads containing 15% (w/w) of legume (chickpea, lentil and bean) flours were produced using selected wheat-legume sourdough (wlsb) and traditional wheat sourdough (wsb). compared to wheat yeasted bread (wyb), the level of total free amino acids (faa) was higher in wsb and wlsb. phytase and antioxidant activities were the highest in wlsb. compared to bread wyb, the addition of legume flours decreased the in vitro protein digestibility (ivpd) (wyb versus wsb). however, the dough fermentation with wslb favored an increase of ivpd. according to the levels of carbohydrates, dietary fibers and resistant starch, wsb and wlsb showed lower values of hydrolysis index (hi) compared to wyb. as showed by texture and image analyses and sensory evaluation of breads, a good acceptability was found for wsb and, especially, wlsb breads.

TI  == diversity of the lactic acid bacterium and yeast microbiota in the switch from firm- to liquid-sourdough fermentation.
AB  == four traditional type i sourdoughs were comparatively propagated (28 days) under  firm (dough yield, 160) and liquid (dough yield, 280) conditions to mimic the alternative technology options frequently used for making baked goods. after 28 days of propagation, liquid sourdoughs had the lowest ph and total titratable acidity (tta), the lowest concentrations of lactic and acetic acids and free amino acids, and the most stable density of presumptive lactic acid bacteria. the cell density of yeasts was the highest in liquid sourdoughs. liquid sourdoughs showed simplified microbial diversity and harbored a low number of strains, which were persistent. lactobacillus plantarum dominated firm sourdoughs over time. leuconostoc lactis and lactobacillus brevis dominated only some firm sourdoughs,  and lactobacillus sanfranciscensis persisted for some time only in some firm sourdoughs. leuconostoc citreum persisted in all firm and liquid sourdoughs, and  it was the only species detected in liquid sourdoughs at all times; it was flanked by leuconostoc mesenteroides in some sourdoughs. saccharomyces cerevisiae, candida humilis, saccharomyces servazzii, saccharomyces bayanus-kazachstania sp., and torulaspora delbrueckii were variously identified in firm and liquid sourdoughs. a total of 197 volatile components were identified through purge and trap-/solid-phase microextraction-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (pt-/spme-gc-ms). aldehydes, several alcohols, and some esters were  at the highest levels in liquid sourdoughs. firm sourdoughs mainly contained ethyl acetate, acetic acid, some sulfur compounds, and terpenes. the use of liquid fermentation would change the main microbial and biochemical features of traditional baked goods, which have been manufactured under firm conditions for a long time.

TI  == prevalence of antibiotic resistance in lactic acid bacteria isolated from the faeces of broiler chicken in malaysia.
AB  == background: probiotics are commonly used as feed additive to substitute antibiotic as growth promoter in animal farming. probiotic consists of lactic acid bacteria (lab), which enhance the growth and health of the animal. probiotic also have higher possibility to become pathogenic bacteria that may carry antibiotic resistant gene that can be transmitted to other lab species. the aim of this study was to identify the lab species in the faeces of broiler chicken and to determine the prevalence of antibiotic resistant in lab of broiler chicken. methods: sixty faeces samples were collected from wet markets located in klang valley of malaysia for the isolation of lab using de-mann rogosa sharpe medium. thirteen species of lab were obtained in this study and the identification of lab was performed by using api test kit on the basis of carbohydrate fermentation profile. antibiotic susceptibility assay was then carried out to determine the prevalence of lab antibiotic resistance. results: lactococcus lactis subsp lactis was found in nine out of sixty faecal samples. lactobacillus paracasei was the second common lab species isolated from chicken faecal. no significant difference (p > 0.05) was found between the occurrence of  lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus curvatus, lactobacillus plantarum, leuconostoc lactis mesenteroides subsp mesenteroides/dectranium and pediococcus pentosaceus isolated from 5 different locations. most of the isolated lab was resistant to antibiotic and high variability of the antibiotic resistance was observed among the lab against 15 types of antibiotics. penicillin, amoxicillin,  chloramphenicol, and ampicillin had significant higher (p< 0.05) inhibitory zone  than nalidixic acid, gentamycin, sulphamethoxazole, kanamycin, and streptomycin.  conclusions: many species of lab were isolated from the faecal samples of broiler chicken that resistance to the common antibiotics used in the farm. the development of resistant against antibiotics in lab can be attributed to the long term exposure of antibiotic as growth promoter and therapeutic agents. thus, it is essential to advise farmer the safety measure of antibiotic application in animal farming. additionally, the supplementation of probiotic in animal feeding  also needs more attention and close monitoring.

TI  == optimization of matrix-assisted-laser-desorption-ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry for the identification of bacterial contaminants in beverages.
AB  == the growth of microbial contaminants in industrially produced beverages can cause turbidity, haze and off-flavors resulting in quality loss often rendering the product undrinkable. in this work matrix-assisted-laser-desorption-ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms) based on the generation of peptide mass fingerprints, which form a distinctive protein peak pattern, is presented as a rapid, reliable and powerful  tool for the identification of spoilage bacteria encountered in beverages. lactobacillus brevis, pediococcus claussenii and leuconostoc mesenteroides were used to optimize sample preparation and maldi-tof ms-settings. different sample preparation methods ranging from plain cell smears to more elaborate extraction procedures including mechanical and enzymatical disruption of cells were investigated. the effects of culturing time and the availability of oxygen and nutrients on the acquired protein peak patterns were studied. while cell smears at times hampered the acquisition of spectra for strain l. brevis all other procedures constantly delivered good quality spectra for all three strains. the extraction procedure allowed good reproducibility of spectra with high information content and enabled differentiation on the species level regardless of the culture conditions used. the application of specific culture conditions to microorganisms resulted in minor but stable changes in spectra, which were not sufficient to impair identification of isolates on the species level.

TI  == species diversity, community dynamics, and metabolite kinetics of spontaneous leek fermentations.
AB  == leek (allium ampeloprasum var. porrum) is one of belgium's most important vegetables. all or part of the green leek parts are often left on the fields because of their limited cooking applications compared to the white leek parts. therefore, the possibility to perform leek fermentations in view of product valorization and diversification was investigated. this study deals with the community dynamics, species diversity, and metabolite kinetics of spontaneous leek fermentations, thereby studying the influence of added nacl concentration, harvesting season, and duration of the fermentation. the combination of a culture-dependent and culture-independent approach revealed the prevalence of lactic acid bacteria (lab) from the third day of fermentation onwards, which was  not influenced by the fermentation conditions applied. enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonadaceae, and yeasts disappeared after one week of fermentation. leuconostoc mesenteroides, lactobacillus sakei, and lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus brevis, and lactobacillus parabrevis were the most frequently isolated lab species. both added nacl concentrations were suitable to perform successful fermentations within three weeks. by that time, glucose and fructose,  the main leek carbohydrates, were metabolized into mainly lactic acid, acetic acid, ethanol, and mannitol. a sensory analysis revealed that the fermented white leek parts were generally more appreciated than the fermented green leek parts.

TI  == fast identification of wine related lactic acid bacteria by multiplex pcr.
AB  == the microflora of must and wine consists of yeasts, acetic acid bacteria and lactic acid bacteria (lab). the latter group plays an important role for wine quality. the malolactic fermentation carried out by lab leads to deacidification  and stabilisation of wines. nevertheless, lab are often associated with wine spoilage. they are mainly responsible for the formation of biogenic amines. furthermore, some strains produce exopolysaccharide slimes, acetic acid, diacetyl and other off-flavours. in this context a better monitoring of the vinification process is crucial to improve wine quality. moreover, a lot of biodiversity studies would also profit from a fast and reliable identification method. in this study, we propose a species-specific multiplex pcr system for a rapid and simultaneous detection of 13 lab species, frequently occurring in must or wine: lactobacillus brevis, lb. buchneri, lb. curvatus, lb. hilgardii, lb. plantarum, leuconostoc mesenteroides, oenococcus oeni, pediococcus acidilactici, p. damnosus, p. inopinatus, p. parvulus, p. pentosaceus and weissella paramesenteroides.

TI  == characterization of lactobacillus brevis l62 strain, highly tolerant to copper ions.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) as starter culture in food industry must be suitable for large-scale industrial production and possess the ability to survive in unfavorable processes and storage conditions. approaches taken to address these problems include the selection of stress-resistant strains. in food industry, lab are often exposed to metal ions induced stress. the interactions between lab and  metal ions are very poorly investigated. because of that, the influence of non-toxic, toxic and antioxidant metal ions (zn, cu, and mn) on growth, acid production, metal ions binding capacity of wild and adapted species of leuconostoc mesenteroides l3, lactobacillus brevis l62 and lactobacillus plantarum l73 were investigated. the proteomic approach was applied to clarify how the lab cells, especially the adapted ones, protect themselves and tolerate high concentrations of toxic metal ions. results have shown that zn and mn addition into mrs medium in the investigated concentrations did not have effect on the bacterial growth and acid production, while copper ions were highly toxic, especially in static conditions. leuc. mesenteroides l3 was the most efficient in zn binding processes among the chosen lab species, while l. plantarum l73 accumulated the highest concentration of mn. l. brevis l62 was the most copper resistant species. adaptation had a positive effect on growth and acid production of all species in the presence of copper. however, the adapted species incorporated less metal ions than the wild species. the exception was adapted l.  brevis l62 that accumulated high concentration of copper ions in static conditions. the obtained results showed that l. brevis l62 is highly tolerant to  copper ions, which allows its use as starter culture in fermentative processes in media with high concentration of copper ions.

TI  == bacterial community dynamics, lactic acid bacteria species diversity and metabolite kinetics of traditional romanian vegetable fermentations.
AB  == background: artisanal vegetable fermentations are very popular in eastern european countries. fresh vegetables undergo a spontaneous fermentation in the presence of salt, which is mainly carried out by lactic acid bacteria (lab). results: culture-dependent and culture-independent analyses of end-samples of various spontaneous vegetable fermentations carried out in houses of the chiodju  region (central romania) revealed lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus brevis as the most frequently isolated lab species. leuconostoc mesenteroides and leuconostoc citreum were also found. furthermore, the community dynamics of spontaneous cauliflower and mixed-vegetable (green tomatoes, carrots and cauliflower) fermentations revealed three steps: an initial phase characterised by the presence of enterobacteriaceae and a wide lab species diversity, encompassing weissella species; a second phase from day 3 onwards wherein l. citreum and lb. brevis occurred; and a final phase characterised by the prevalence of lb. brevis and lb. plantarum. metabolite target analysis revealed that glucose and fructose were mostly depleted at the end of fermentation. the main products of carbohydrate metabolism were lactic acid, acetic acid, ethanol and small amounts of mannitol, indicating heterolactate fermentation. conclusion: given their prevalence at the end of vegetable fermentations, lb. brevis and lb.  plantarum appear to be good candidate starter cultures for controlled vegetable fermentation processes.

TI  == effects of bile salt deconjugation by probiotic strains on the survival of antibiotic-resistant foodborne pathogens under simulated gastric conditions.
AB  == this study was designed to evaluate the effects of bile acid deconjugation by probiotic strains on the antibiotic susceptibility of antibiotic-sensitive and multiple antibiotic-resistant salmonella typhimurium and staphylococcus aureus. eight probiotic strains, bifidobacterium longum b6, lactobacillus acidophilus adh, lactobacillus brevis kacc 10553, lactobacillus casei kacc 12413, lactobacillus paracasei atcc 25598, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, leuconostoc mesenteroides kacc 12312, and pediococcus acidilactici kacc 12307, were used to examine bile acid tolerance. the ability to deconjugate bile acids was evaluated  using both thin-layer chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography.  the antibiotic susceptibility testing was carried out to determine the synergistic inhibitory activity of deconjugated bile acids. l. acidophilus, l. brevis, and p. acidilactici showed the most tolerance to the conjugated bile acids. p. acidilactici deconjugated glycocholic acid and glycodeoxycholate from 3.18 and 3.09 mm to the detection limits, respectively. the antibiotic susceptibility of selected foodborne pathogens was increased by increasing the concentration of deconjugated bile acids. the study results are useful for understanding the relationship between bile acid deconjugation by probiotic strains and antibiotic susceptibility in the presence of deconjugated bile acids, and they may be useful for designing new probiotic-antibiotic combination therapy based on bile acid deconjugation.

TI  == phylogenetic analysis of a spontaneous cocoa bean fermentation metagenome reveals new insights into its bacterial and fungal community diversity.
AB  == this is the first report on the phylogenetic analysis of the community diversity  of a single spontaneous cocoa bean box fermentation sample through a metagenomic  approach involving 454 pyrosequencing. several sequence-based and composition-based taxonomic profiling tools were used and evaluated to avoid software-dependent results and their outcome was validated by comparison with previously obtained culture-dependent and culture-independent data. overall, this approach revealed a wider bacterial (mainly gamma-proteobacteria) and fungal diversity than previously found. further, the use of a combination of different classification methods, in a software-independent way, helped to understand the actual composition of the microbial ecosystem under study. in addition, bacteriophage-related sequences were found. the bacterial diversity depended partially on the methods used, as composition-based methods predicted a wider diversity than sequence-based methods, and as classification methods based solely on phylogenetic marker genes predicted a more restricted diversity compared with  methods that took all reads into account. the metagenomic sequencing analysis identified hanseniaspora uvarum, hanseniaspora opuntiae, saccharomyces cerevisiae, lactobacillus fermentum, and acetobacter pasteurianus as the prevailing species. also, the presence of occasional members of the cocoa bean fermentation process was revealed (such as erwinia tasmaniensis, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and oenococcus oeni). furthermore, the sequence reads  associated with viral communities were of a restricted diversity, dominated by myoviridae and siphoviridae, and reflecting lactobacillus as the dominant host. to conclude, an accurate overview of all members of a cocoa bean fermentation process sample was revealed, indicating the superiority of metagenomic sequencing over previously used techniques.

TI  == genotypic and phenotypic characterization of lactic acid bacteria isolated from italian ryegrass silage.
AB  == twenty-three lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from three cultivars (akiaoba, nagahahikari and tachiwase) of italian ryegrass (lolium multiflorum lam.) silage  were precisely characterized by a combination of phenotypic tests, genotypic 16s  ribosomal dna sequencing and rapid pcr-based analyses, focusing on their useful phenotypes for silage preparation as inoculants. we successfully identified both  at the species and subspecies levels: phenotypically novel lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus coryniformis subsp. torquens,  lactobacillus curvatus, lactobacillus plantarum subsp. plantarum, lactobacillus sakei subsp. carnosus, leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. dextranicum and pediococcus parvulus. this is the first report to elucidate the presence of lactobacillus coryniformis ssp. torquens and leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. dextranicum in italian ryegrass silages. physiological and biochemical tests revealed that phenotypic characteristics are different among the different strains of the same species and subspecies, and that the isolates show unique and diverse phenotypes related to fermentation factors, such as available carbohydrates, optimal growth ph and temperature. these results suggest that, for various well-preserved silage preparations, the isolates may be useful in producing novel inoculants corresponding to their optimally climatic and ecological niches.

TI  == combination of culture-dependent and culture-independent molecular methods for the determination of lactic microbiota in sucuk.
AB  == in this study, the culture-dependent and culture-independent molecular methods were used for the identification of lactic acid bacteria (lab) in sucuk a turkish fermented dry sausage. on the one hand, the pcr-dgge method targetting the v1 and v3 regions of 16s dna was applied to dna that was directly extracted from sucuk samples. on the other hand, rep-pcr fingerprinting was performed for the primary  differentiation and grouping of the isolates, and the results were confirmed by sequencing of the 16s rdna and 16s-23s rdna intergenic spacer region. as a result of the pcr-dgge analysis of all the samples, total 8 different lactic acid bacteria were identified, and lactobacillus sakei, lactobacillus curvatus and weissella viridescens were the dominant microbiota among these bacteria. the culture-dependent approach indicated that the majority of the strains belonged to the lactobacillus genera including lb. sakei, lactobacillus plantarum, lb. curvatus, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus farciminis and lactobacillus alimentarius. however, leuconostoc and weisella were also detected as minor genera. again, lactococcus piscium, weissella halotolerans, staphylococcus succinus and the comigrated staphylococcus piscifermentans/staphylococcus condimenti/staphylococcus carnosus group were detected only with the culture-independent method while lb. plantarum, leuconostoc mesenteroides and leuconostoc citreum were identified only by using the culture-dependent method. in the results, it was concluded that the combination of culture-dependent and culture-independent methods was necessary for reliable and detailed investigation of lab communities in fermented food products.

TI  == diversity of lactic acid bacteria associated with traditional fermented dairy products in mongolia.
AB  == spontaneous milk fermentation has a long history in mongolia, and beneficial microorganisms have been handed down from one generation to the next for use in fermented dairy products. the objective of this study was to investigate the diversity of lactic acid bacteria (lab) communities in fermented yak, mare, goat, and cow milk products by analyzing 189 samples collected from 13 different regions in mongolia. the lab counts in these samples varied from 3.41 to 9.03 log cfu/ml. fermented yak and mare milks had almost identical mean numbers of lab, which were significantly higher than those in fermented goat milk but slightly lower than those in fermented cow milk. in total, 668 isolates were obtained from these samples using de man, rogosa, and sharpe agar and m17 agar. each isolate was considered to be presumptive lab based on gram-positive and catalase-negative properties, and was identified at the species level by 16s rrna gene sequencing,  multiplex pcr assay, and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. all isolates from mongolian dairy products were accurately identified as enterococcus faecalis (1 strain), enterococcus durans (3 strains), lactobacillus brevis (3 strains), lactobacillus buchneri (2 strains), lactobacillus casei (16 strains), lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (142 strains), lactobacillus diolivorans (17 strains), lactobacillus fermentum (42 strains), lactobacillus helveticus (183 strains), lactobacillus kefiri (6 strains), lactobacillus plantarum ssp. plantarum (7 strains), lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis (7 strains), leuconostoc lactis (22 strains), leuconostoc mesenteroides (21 strains), streptococcus thermophilus (195 strains), and weissella cibaria (1 strain). the predominant lab were strep. thermophilus and lb. helveticus, which were isolated  from all sampling sites. the results demonstrate that traditional fermented dairy products from different regions of mongolia have complex compositions of lab species. such diversity of lab provides useful information for further studies of probiotic strain selection and starter culture design, with regard to the industrial production of traditional fermented milk.

TI  == a beta-glucosidase from oenococcus oeni atcc baa-1163 with potential for aroma release in wine: cloning and expression in e. coli.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) are responsible for olfactory changes in wine during malolactic fermentation (mlf). a side characteristic of mlf is the release of grape derived aroma compounds from their glycosylated precursors by beta-glycosidase activities of these bacteria. apart from oenococcus oeni, which  is regarded as the most promising species for mlf, glycosidic activities have also been observed in wine related members of the genera lactobacillus and pediococcus. nevertheless, information on the involved enzymes including their potential use in winemaking is limited. in this study we report that beta-glucosidases with similar protein sequences can be identified in the genomes of lactobacillus brevis, o. oeni and leuconostoc mesenteroides. ttg serves as start codon for the glucosidase gene of o. oeni. the beta-glucosidase of o. oeni  atcc baa-1163 was expressed in e. coli and partially characterized. the enzyme displayed characteristics similar to beta-glucosidases isolated from l. brevis and l. mesenteroides. a ph optimum between 5.0 and 5.5, and a k(m) of 0.17 mmol l(-1 )pnp-beta-d-glucopyranoside were determined. a glycosyltransferase activity  was observed in the presence of ethanol. the enzyme from o. oeni was capable to hydrolyze glycosides extracted from muskat wine. this study also contains a report on glycosidase activities of several lab species including oenococcus kitaharae.

TI  == probiotic table olives: microbial populations adhering on olive surface in fermentation sets inoculated with the probiotic strain lactobacillus paracasei impc2.1 in an industrial plant.
AB  == this study reports the dynamics of microbial populations adhering on the surface  of debittered green olives cv. bella di cerignola in fermentation sets inoculated with the probiotic strain lactobacillus paracasei impc2.1 in different brining conditions (4% and 8% (w/v) nacl) at room temperature and 4 degrees c. the probiotic strain successfully colonized the olive surface dominating the natural  lab population and decreasing the ph of brines to <or=5.0 after 30 days until the end of fermentation. the dynamics of microbial populations associated with olive  surface and belonging to the different groups indicated that inoculated olives held at room temperature did not host enterobacteriaceae at the end of fermentation. yeast populations were present in a low number (<or=log(10) 5.7 cfu/g) throughout the process. a considerable genetic diversity of lab species colonizing the olive surface was found mainly in inoculated set brined in 8% nacl, as indicated by the shannon diversity index calculated for each set. generally, strains of lactobacillus coryniformis, l. paracasei, l. plantarum, l.  pentosus, l. rhamnosus, l. brevis, l. mali, l. vaccinostercus, l.casei, leuconostoc mesenteroides, leuc. pseudomesenteroides, lactococcus lactis, weissella paramesenteroides, w. cibaria, enterococcus casseliflavus group and e.  italicus were identified during the whole process. in particular, l. pentosus was the most frequently isolated species and it showed a high strain diversity throughout fermentation in all processes except for the one held at 4 degrees c.  also a notable incidence of leuc. mesenteroides on olives was highlighted in this study during all fermentation. results indicated that the human strain l. paracasei impc2.1 can be considered an example of a strain used in the dual role  of starter and probiotic culture which allowed the control of fermentation processes and the realization of a final probiotic product with functional appeal.

TI  == biodiversity of lactic acid bacteria in french wheat sourdough as determined by molecular characterization using species-specific pcr.
AB  == the lactic acid microflora of nine traditional wheat sourdoughs from the midi-pyrenees area (south western france) was previously isolated and preliminary characterized using conventional morphological and biochemical analysis. however, such phenotypic methods alone are not always reliable and have a low taxonomic resolution for identification of lactic acid bacteria species. in the present study, a total of 290 lab isolates were identified by pcr amplification using different sets of specific primers in order to provide a thorough characterization of the lactic flora from these traditional french sourdoughs. overall, the lab isolates belonged to 6 genera: lactobacillus (39%, 8 species), pediococcus (38%, 1 species), leuconostoc (17%, 2 species), weissella (4%, 2 species), lactococcus (1%, 1 species) and enterococcus (<1%, 1 species) and 15 different species were detected: l. plantarum, l. curvatus, l. paracasei, l. sanfranciscensis, l. pentosus, l. paraplantarum, l. sakei, l. brevis, p. pentosaceus, l. mesenteroides, l. citreum, w. cibaria, w. confusa, l. lactis and  e. hirae. facultative heterofermentative lab represent more than 76% of the total isolates, the main species isolated herein correspond to l. plantarum and p. pentosaceus. obligate heterofermentative lactobacilli (l. sanfranciscencis, l. brevis) represent less than 3% of the total isolates whereas leuconostoc and weissella species represent 21% of the total isolates and have been detected in eight of the nine samples. detection of some lab species was preferentially observed depending on the isolation culture medium. the number of different species within a sourdough varies from 3 to 7 and original associations of hetero- and homofermentative lab species have been revealed. results from this study clearly confirm the diversity encountered in the microbial community of traditional sourdough and highlight the importance of lab cocci in the sourdough  ecosystem, along with lactobacilli.

TI  == molecular screening of wine lactic acid bacteria degrading hydroxycinnamic acids.
AB  == the potential to produce volatile phenols from hydroxycinnamic acids was investigated for lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from spanish grape must and  wine. a pcr assay was developed for the detection of lab that potentially produce volatile phenols. synthetic degenerate oligonucleotides for the specific detection of the pdc gene encoding a phenolic acid decarboxylase were designed. the pdc pcr assay amplifies a 321 bp dna fragment from phenolic acid decarboxylase. the pdc pcr method was applied to 85 strains belonging to the 6 main wine lab species. lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus brevis, and pediococcus pentosaceus strains produce a positive response in the pdc pcr assay, whereas oenococcus oeni, lactobacillus hilgardii, and leuconostoc mesenteroides strains did not produce the expected pcr product. the production of vinyl and ethyl derivatives from hydroxycinnamic acids in culture media was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. a relationship was found between pdc pcr  amplification and volatile phenol production, so that the lab strains that gave a positive pdc pcr response produce volatile phenols, whereas strains that did not  produce a pcr amplicon did not produce volatile phenols. the proposed method could be useful for a preliminary identification of lab strains able to produce volatile phenols in wine.

AB  == the effects of 3 different methods for removing the initial air on the properties of fermented plant beverages produced from phom-nang seaweed (gracilaria fisheri) and wild forest noni (morinda coreia ham.) were investigated. only method m which covered the space above the fermentation liquid with a water filled plastic bag produced no surface film of yeast, had the highest acidity and also antibacterial activity from both plants after 90 days of fermentation. however, the yeast count still exceeded the standard guidelines for plant beverages. the fermented beverage from wild forest noni showed more antibacterial activity against 3 of 4  pathogenic bacteria tested than that from the phomnang seaweed, probably for its  higher levels of acidity and ethanol content. lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from the fermentation samples from days 1-5 using the method m from both fermented plant beverages were leuconostoc mesenteroides supsp. mesenteroides and leu. mesenteroides subsp. dextranicum while presence of lactobacilus plantarum was only recorded at days 4-5 in the wild forest noni beverage. from days 6-14 the isolates were lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus brevis from wild forest noni beverage, whereas only l. brevis was not detected in the seaweed beverage. during days 21-45 both beverages had a similar lab population of l. plantarum and l. brevis while l. coryniformis was only found in the wild forest noni beverage. between days 60-90 in both plant beverages only l. plantarum and lactobacillius sp. were detected.

TI  == biodiversity of the microbial community in a spanish farmhouse cheese as revealed by culture-dependent and culture-independent methods.
AB  == the microbial diversity within alberquilla cheese, made from a spontaneously fermented mixture of raw goats' and sheep's milk in the alpujarra mountains (granada, south-east spain), has been studied by the classical culturing method and also by molecular analysis of community dna. a collection of 206 isolates was obtained from the cheese on different selective/differential media, which were then re-grouped to 52 after randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd)-pcr analyses. isolates on man-rogosa and sharpe-agar (mrs), m17-glucose agar and kenner fecal (kf)-agar medium were identified by specific pcr or 16s rrna gene sequencing and belonged mainly to the lactic-acid bacteria group. the predominant genus was lactobacillus, which accounted for more than 50% of the isolates, the most abundant species being lactobacillus paracasei, followed by considerably less quantities of lb. plantarum and lb. brevis. other lactic-acid bacteria identified were pediococcus urinaequi, leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, leuc. mesenteroides, lactococcus lactis and even the enterococci enterococcus faecium and e. devriesei. cluster analyses of rapd-pcr patterns revealed a high degree of diversity among the lactobacilli. the gram-negative bacterial strains belonged mainly to hafnia alvei species. the microbes occurring in alberquilla cheese were also studied by pcr temporal temperature-gradient gel electrophoresis (ttge) of the 16s rrna v3 region and partial 16s rrna sequencing of the ttge bands. the results showed a major presence of lactic-acid bacteria closely related to lc. lactis, lb. paracasei, lb. plantarum, lb. brevis, lb. acidophilus and enterococcus sp. the non-lactic-acid bacterium detected was identified as escherichia coli. all the enterococcus strains showed great susceptibility to the most clinically relevant antibiotics, harbouring only the virulence gene efaafm.  on the basis of their antimicrobial activity against listeria monocytogenes we chose two strains of ln. mesenteroides that produced mesenterocin b105 and mesenterocin y105, as revealed by pcr techniques.

TI  == functional properties of selected starter cultures for sour maize bread.
AB  == this paper focuses on the functional properties of maize sour-dough microflora selected and tested for their use as starter cultures for sour maize bread. lactic acid bacteria and yeasts isolated from spontaneously fermented maize dough were selected based on dominance during fermentation and presence at the end of fermentation. functional properties examined included acidification, leavening and production of some antimicrobial compounds in the fermenting matrix. the organisms previously identified as lactobacillus plantarum, lb. brevis, lb. fermentum, lb. acidophilus, pediococcus acidilactici, leuconostoc mesenteroides and leuconostoc dextranicum and saccharomyces cerevisiae were used singly and as  mixed cultures in the fermentation (fermentation time: 12h at 28+/-2 degrees c) of maize meal (particle size >0.2mm). the ph fell from an initial value of 5.62-3.05 in maize meals fermented with lb. plantarum; 4.37 in l. dextranicum+s.  cerevisiae compared with the value for the control (no starter) of 4.54. significant differences (p <or =0.05) were observed in values obtained for the functional properties tested when starters were inoculated compared with the control (no starter) except for leavening. bivariate correlations at 0.01 levels  (two-tailed) showed that significant correlations existed among ph and production of antimicrobial compounds in the fermenting meals, the highest correlation being between production of diacetyl and acid (0.694), a positive correlation indicating that production of both antimicrobial compounds increase together with time. antimicrobial activities of the fermented maize dough were confirmed by their abilities to inhibit the growth of salmonella typhi, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus and aspergillus flavus from an initial inoculum concentration of 7 log cfu ml(-1)) for test bacteria and zone of inhibition of up to 1.33 cm for aflatoxigenic a. flavus. the findings of this study form a database for further studies on the development of starter cultures for sour maize bread production as an alternative bread specialty.

TI  == characterization and selection of autochthonous lactic acid bacteria isolated from traditional iberian dry-fermented salchichon and chorizo sausages.
AB  == a total of 192 lactic acid bacteria were isolated from 2 types of naturally fermented dry sausages at 3 different stages of the ripening process in order to  select the most suitable strains as starter cultures in dry-cured sausage manufacture according to their technological characteristics such as glucose fermentation, lactic and acetic acid production, and proteolytic, lipolytic, and  antimicrobial activities. identification of the isolates revealed that 31.2% were pediococcus pentosaceus, 26.9% lactococcus lactis, 18.6% pediococcus acidilactici, 17% lactobacillus brevis, and sporadic isolates of leuconostoc mesenteroides, lactobacillus plantarum, and lactobacillus curvatus. most of the strains did not produce gas from glucose and showed the capacity to produce lactic acid rapidly. some 25% of the strains were able to degrade tributyrin (esterase activity), but none showed lipolytic activity against olive oil and pork fat. only 3 strains of p. acidilactici showed weak proteolytic activity against myofibrillar or sarcoplasmic proteins. also, the same strains showed antimicrobial activity against listeria monocytogenes. nine strains with the best properties were preselected and tested for biogenic amine production. the results showed that two of the strains, identified as p. acidilactici by polymerase chain reaction, had the potential to be further tested as starter cultures in pilot processing of iberian sausages.

AB  == a 4661bp cryptic plasmid, pfmbl1, was isolated from leuconostoc mesenteroides sy2, an isolate from kimchi, and characterized. nucleotide sequence analysis revealed two open reading frames, orf1 and orf2. orf2 was 453bp in size and its translation product had 58% identity with a putative protein possibly involved in the replication of ptxl1, a cryptic plasmid from l. mesenteroides ssp. mesenteroides y110. rna transcript from orf2 was detected but not from orf1 or intergenic region. minimum 3.5kb fragment encompassing orf1 and orf2 was required for the replication of pfmbl1 and employed for the construction of escherichia coli-leuconostoc shuttle vector, psj33e. l. mesenteroides sy1 (another kimchi isolate), leuconostoc ssp., and lactobacillus brevis were successfully transformed with psj33e, and the transformation efficiencies were ranged between  1.1x10(1) and 4x10(5)transformants/microg dna. no single-stranded dna intermediate was detected from l. mesenteroides sy1 cells harboring psj33e, indicating that pfmbl1 probably replicated via theta-type mechanism. psj33e was stably maintained in l. mesenteroides sy1 in the absence of erythromycin (em, 5 microg/ml) and after 1 month of daily subculturing in mrs broth without selective pressure, three percent of cells still retained psj33e.

AB  == non-enterococcal gram-positive bacteria that are intrinsically vancomycin-resistant have been infrequently isolated in association with serious  infections. however, well-documented infections have lately been reported with increasing frequency. because these organisms may be pathogens, we tested the mics of 19 antimicrobial agents by the agar dilution method for predicting susceptibility. the activity of these antimicrobial agents was assessed against 28 strains (lactobacillus rhamnosus, 6; lactobacillus acidophilus, 1; lactobacillus casei, 1; lactobacillus fermentum, 2; lactobacillus brevis, 1; lactobacillus plantarum, 1; weissella confusa, 2; leuconostoc mesenteroides, 7; leuconostoc lactis, 4; pediococcus acidilactici, 2; pediococcus pentosaceus, 1),  isolated from clinical specimens in an argentinian university hospital from 1997  to 2003. the mics of penicillin for 67% of the lactobacillus strains and 100% of  the leuconostoc spp. and pediococcus spp. strains tested were in the 0.25-2 microg/ml range. erythromycin was the most active antimicrobial overall. multiresistance was observed in 2 strains (lactobacillus rhamnosus, 1; lactobacillus plantarum, 1).

TI  == lactobacillus plantarum gene clusters encoding putative cell-surface protein complexes for carbohydrate utilization are conserved in specific gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == background: genomes of gram-positive bacteria encode many putative cell-surface proteins, of which the majority has no known function. from the rapidly increasing number of available genome sequences it has become apparent that many  cell-surface proteins are conserved, and frequently encoded in gene clusters or operons, suggesting common functions, and interactions of multiple components. results: a novel gene cluster encoding exclusively cell-surface proteins was identified, which is conserved in a subgroup of gram-positive bacteria. each gene cluster generally has one copy of four new gene families called csca, cscb, cscc  and cscd. clusters encoding these cell-surface proteins were found only in complete genomes of lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus sakei, enterococcus faecalis, listeria innocua, listeria monocytogenes, lactococcus lactis ssp lactis and bacillus cereus and in incomplete genomes of l. lactis ssp cremoris, lactobacillus casei, enterococcus faecium, pediococcus pentosaceus, lactobacillius brevis, oenococcus oeni, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and bacillus thuringiensis. these genes are neither present in the genomes of streptococci, staphylococci and clostridia, nor in the lactobacillus acidophilus group, suggesting a niche-specific distribution, possibly relating to association with plants. all encoded proteins have a signal peptide for secretion by the sec-dependent pathway, while some have cell-surface anchors, novel wxl domains, and putative domains for sugar binding and degradation. transcriptome analysis in l. plantarum shows that the csca-d genes are co-expressed, supporting their operon organization. many gene clusters are significantly up-regulated in a glucose-grown, ccpa-mutant derivative of l. plantarum, suggesting catabolite control. this is supported by the presence of predicted cre-sites upstream or inside the up-regulated csca-d gene clusters. conclusion: we propose that the csca, cscb, cscc and cscd proteins form cell-surface protein complexes and play a role in carbon source acquisition. primary occurrence in plant-associated gram-positive bacteria suggests a possible role in degradation and utilization of plant oligo- or poly-saccharides.

TI  == characterisation of lab in typical salento pecorino cheese.
AB  == twenty-nine strains of lactic acid bacteria isolated from the typical pecorino cheese of the salento area of italy, were identified and grouped according to their genetic similarity. a preliminary characterisation of the strains was conducted by means of morphological and biochemical analysis, but molecular approaches were necessary for the clear identification of the species. for the species detection, the amplification and sequencing of the 16s rdna gene was employed in addition, restriction analysis of amplified rdna (ardra) and pcr and  aflp fingerprinting enabled inter- and intra-specific variation to be estimated upgma cluster analysis was used to divide the strains into distinct clusters which corresponded with the species delineation obtained by molecular identification. the data obtained show that the community of lactobacilli responsible for the fermentation and aging of pecorino cheese is composed of a limited number of species. the main identified strains were lactobacillus brevis, l. plantarum, l. casei, l. sakei, l. pentosus, l. farciminis and leuconostoc mesenteroides.

TI  == 16s-ardra, a tool for identification of lactic acid bacteria isolated from grape  must and wine.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) are found in a great variety of habitats, including grape must and wines. there is a close relationship between the species of lab which develop during fermentation and the eventual quality of the wine. for these reasons analytical techniques allowing fast and reliable identification of wine lab are needed. in this work a simple and accurate protocol for identifying species of lab isolated from grape must and wine is presented. this protocol is based on the amplification, directly from colony, of 16s rdna and later digestion with one of the following restriction enzymes bfai, msei and alui. a sequential use of the three enzymes is proposed to simplify lab wine identification, first msei, then bfai and finally, if necessary, alui digestion. the technique was able to discriminate 32 of the 36 lab reference species tested and allowed the identification of 342 isolates from musts and wines. the isolates belonged to the species: lactobacillus brevis, l. collinoides, l. coryniformis, l. bilgardii, l.  mali, l. paracasei, leuconostoc mesenteroides, oenococcus oeni, pediococcus parvulus and p. pentosaceus.

TI  == isolation, characterisation and identification of lactic acid bacteria from bushera: a ugandan traditional fermented beverage.
AB  == one hundred and thirteen strains of lactic acid bacteria (lab) were selected from 351 isolates from 15 samples of traditionally fermented household bushera from uganda and also from laboratory-prepared bushera. isolates were phenotypically characterised by their ability to ferment 49 carbohydrates using api 50 chl kits  and additional biochemical tests. coliforms, yeasts and lab were enumerated in bushera. the ph, volatile organic compounds and organic acids were also determined. the lab counts in household bushera varied between 7.1 and 9.4 log cfu ml(-1). the coliform counts varied between < 1 and 5.2 log cfu ml(-1). the ph of bushera ranged from 3.7 to 4.5. ethanol (max, 0.27%) was the major volatile organic compound while lactic acid (max, 0.52%) was identified as the dominant organic acid in household bushera. the initial numbers of lab and coliforms in laboratory-fermented bushera were similar; however, the lab numbers increased faster during the first 24 h. lab counts increased from 5.5 to 9.0 log cfu ml(-1) during the laboratory fermentation. coliform counts increased from 5.9 to 7.8 log cfu ml(-1) at 24 h, but after 48 h, counts were less 4 log cfu ml(-1). yeasts increased from 4.3 to 7.7 log cfu ml(-1) at 48 h, but thereafter decreased slightly. the ph declined from 7.0 to around 4.0. lactic acid and ethanol increased from zero to 0.75% and 0.20%, respectively. lactic acid bacteria isolated from household bushera belonged to lactobacillus, streptococcus and enterococcus genera. tentatively, lactobacillus isolates were identified as lactobacillus plantarum, l. paracasei subsp. paracasei, l. fermentum, l. brevis and l. delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii. streptococcus thermophilus strains were also identified in household bushera. lab isolated from bushera produced in the laboratory belonged to five genera (lactococcus, leuconostoc, lactobacillus, weissella and enterococcus. eight isolates were able to produce acid from starch  and were identified as lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (four strains), leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides (one strain), leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. dextranicum (one strain), weissella confusa (one strain) and l. plantarum (one strain).

TI  == lactic acid fermentation of cassava dough into agbelima.
AB  == the souring of cassava dough during fermentation into the fermented cassava meal, agbelima, was investigated. four different types of traditional inocula were used to ferment the dough and increases in titrable acidity expressed as lactic acid from 0.31-0.38 to 0.78-0.91% (w/w) confirmed the fermentation to be a process of  acidification. the microflora of all inocula and fermenting dough contained high  counts of lactic acid bacteria, 10(8)-10(9) cfu/g in all inocula and 10(7)-10(8), 10(8)-10(9) and 10(9) cfu/g at 0, 24 and 48 h in all fermentations. lactobacillus plantarum was the dominant species of lactic acid bacteria during all types of fermentation accounting for 51% of 171 representative isolates taken from various stages of fermentation. other major lactic acid bacteria found were lactobacillus brevis, 16%, leuconostoc mesenteroides, 15% and some cocci including streptococcus spp. whose numbers decreased with fermentation time. the lactic acid bacteria were responsible for the souring of agbelima through the production of lactic acid. all l. plantarum, l. brevis and l. mesenteroides isolates examined demonstrated linamarase as well as other enzymatic activities but did not possess tissue degrading enzymes like cellulase, pectin esterase and polygalacturonase. the aroma profile of agbelima did not vary with the type of inoculum used and in all samples the build-up of aroma compounds were dominated by a non-identified low molecular weight alcohol, 1-propanol, isoamyl alcohol, ethyl acetate, 3-methyl-1-butanol and acetoin. substantial reductions occurred in the levels of cyanogenic compounds present in cassava during fermentation into agbelima and detoxification was enhanced by the use of inoculum.

AB  == a total of 348 lactic acid bacteria isolated from five batches of naturally fermented dry salami at various stages of ripening were characterised. the majority of the strains were assigned to two main phylogenetic groups of species: (i) the psychrotrophic, formerly called atypical, meat streptobacteria (169 strains) and (ii) a new genus weissella (120), which was recently proposed (collins et al., 1993) to include leuconostoc paramesenteroides and some other closely related species. meat streptobacteria were identified as lactobacillus curvatus (88 strains) and l. sake (76), whereas 5 strains were indistinguishable  and, thus designated l. sake/curvatus. non-psychrotrophic streptobacteria were also isolated and identified as l. plantarum (34 strains), l. farciminis (10), l. coryniformis (1) and l. casei subsp. pseudoplantarum (1). the majority of the weissella strains (86) were leuconostoc-like bacteria; four of them were identified as w. viridescens, 11 belonged to the newly described w. hellenica (collins et al., 1993), another 11 resembled w. paramesenteroides, whereas 60 isolates were not classified to any species. the latter group comprised strains that produced d(l)-lactate. the remaining weissella were gas-forming, arginine-positive rods assigned to w. minor (31) and w. halotolerans (3). other species identified were enterococcus faecium (10), leuconostoc mesenteroides (1), l. brevis (1) and pediococcus sp. (1). the main criteria used to distinguish between above species as well as their distribution on the five salami batches in relation to their succession with time and suitability as starters were discussed.

AB  == the uptake kinetics of sugars present in wheat doughs and alpha-glucosidase as well as beta-fructosidase activities were determined in different strains of yeasts and lactic acid bacteria. these strains were previously selected according to their breadmaking quality. saccharomyces cerevisiae (p6), candida guilliermondii (p40), lactobacillus plantarum (b31 and la18) and l. brevis (b21)  showed good performance, while sacch. fructuum (p43), l. cellobiosus (b37) and enterococcus faecium (b11) yielded bread of lower quality. leuconostoc mesenteroides (b10), when used in combination with other strains led also to high quality starters. all yeast strains used assimilated glucose, fructose and maltose, exhibiting saturable kinetics. lactic acid bacteria showed saturable kinetics only for hexoses, whereas disaccharide uptake was linear. sacch. cerevisiae, leuconostoc mesenteroides, l. brevis and l. plantarum (b31) displayed better sugar uptake properties. for all the strains used alpha-glucosidase and beta-fructosidase activities were detected. the highest specific activities were  found for sacch. cerevisiae, c. guilliermondii and l. plantarum (b31). these results indicate good correlation between the parameters evaluated and the breadmaking potential of the microorganisms.

TI  == occurrence of an inhibitor of lactic acid bacteria in green olives.
AB  == green olives were found to contain an inhibitor(s) of several species of lactic acid bacteria usually associated with the spanish-type brined olive fermentation. the inhibitor was demonstrated by the presence of inhibition zones surrounding tissue which had been cut from frozen olives and implanted in a seeded nutritive  agar medium. relative potencies of aqueous extracts of frozen olives were determined by a paper disc assay method. the mission variety of olive contained the most inhibitor, and the manzanillo and ascolano, about 50 and 40% as much as  the mission variety, respectively. sevillano and barouni varieties contained comparatively little inhibitor. effects of the inhibitor on growth rates of lactic acid bacteria were determined by adding various amounts of a concentrated  aqueous extract of olives to a nutritive broth medium contained in screw-capped tubes. of the four species of lactic acid bacteria tested, leuconostoc mesenteroides was the most sensitive, and lactobacillus plantarum was the least sensitive; pediococcus cerevisiae and lactobacillus brevis were intermediate in sensitivity. extracts possessed a bactericidal property, as evidenced by their effect on l. mesenteroides. sodium chloride, especially at concentrations of about 5% and higher, greatly increased the effectiveness of the inhibitor. the inhibitor was ethyl alcohol-soluble and was stable when heated at 100 c in aqueous solution. potencies of extracts were reduced greatly by adjustment to ph  10, but no appreciable effect was noted by adjustment to ph 0.8.

TI  == pure culture fermentation of green olives.
AB  == the method previously developed by us for the pure-culture fermentation of brined cucumbers and other vegetables has been applied successfully to manzanillo variety olives. field-run grade fruit was processed first by conventional procedures to remove most of the bitterness. then the relative abilities of lactobacillus plantarum, l. brevis, pediococcus cerevisiae, and leuconostoc mesenteroides to become established and produce acid in both heat-shocked (74 c for 3 min) and unheated olives, brined at 4.7 to 5.9% nacl (w/v basis), were evaluated. the heat-shock treatment not only proved effective in ridding the fruit of naturally occurring, interfering, and competitive microbial groups prior to brining and inoculation, but also made the olives highly fermentable with respect to growth and acid production by the introduced culture, particularly l.  plantarum. of the four species used as inocula, l. plantarum was by far the most  vigorous in fermentation ability. it consistently produced the highest levels of  brine acidity (1.0 to 1.2% calculated as lactic acid) and the lowest ph values (3.8 to 3.9) during the fermentation of heat-shocked olives. also, l. plantarum completely dominated fermentations when used in two-species (with p. cerevisiae)  and three-species (with p. cerevisiae and l. brevis) combinations as inocula. in  contrast, when l. plantarum was inoculated into the brines of unheated olives it  failed to become properly established; the same was true for the other species tested, but even to a more pronounced degree. l. brevis was the only species used that failed to develop in brines of both heat-shocked and unheated olives. modification of the curing brine by the addition of lactic acid at the outset, either with or without dextrose, led to a much earlier onset of fermentation with accompanying acid development, as compared to treatments with dextrose alone or nonadditive controls. reasons for the marked improvement of the fermentability of manzanillo olives receiving the prebrining heat-shock treatment are discussed.

TI  == effect of lactic acid bacteria on growth of staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == cultures of lactic acid bacteria, mostly from foods, were tested for their effect on the growth of staphylococcus aureus in trypticase soy broth (bbl). some of the effectors, e.g., streptococcus faecalis, s. faecium, lactobacillus lactis, l. brevis, and leuconostoc mesenteroides, stimulated growth of s. aureus during early hours of growth, especially at higher temperatures of incubation, but most  cultures were inhibitory, and some (s. faecium and l. mesenteroides) were even killing by the time of attainment of the maximal phase of growth of the staphylococcus. low-temperature meat lactobacilli and leuconostoc dextranicum inhibited s. aureus at 10, 15, 20, and 25 c throughout its growth. streptococcus  faecalis var. liquefaciens inhibited at these temperatures and at 30 and 37 c, as well. when the ratio of effectors to staphylococci in the inoculum was 100:1, the three enterococci, the meat lactobacillus, and l. dextranicum prevented the attainment of 5 x 10(6) staphylococci per milliliter at 15 c, and all but the meat lactobacillus did so at 22 c. a ratio of 1:1 accomplished similar results at 15 c, except that s. aureus was only delayed for 12 hr by s. faecalis. a ratio of 1:100 usually was ineffective. in general, the more effector bacteria there were  in the inoculum, the greater was the overall inhibition (or stimulation) of s. aureus. inhibition was most effective at 10 or 15 c, less so at 20 or 25 c, and least at 30 or 37 c, whereas stimulation during early growth was greater at the higher temperatures. results with different strains of the effectors and with two strains of s. aureus were similar, for the most part.
