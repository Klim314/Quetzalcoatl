TI  - Induction of chronic arthritis in rats by cell wall fragments of anaerobic coccoid rods isolated from the faecal flora of patients with Crohn's disease.
AB  - Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are accompanied by seronegative arthritis  in about one fifth of the cases. In the present study, cell wall fragments from major residents such as Eubacterium, Coprococcus and Peptostreptococcus species, isolated from the faecal flora of patients with Crohn's disease, were tested for properties to induce chronic arthritis in Lewis rats. Cell wall fragments from Eubacterium contortum strains Me44 and Me47 were found to induce chronic arthritis; Peptostreptococcus productus strain C 18 cell wall fragments induced acute self-limiting arthritis. Coprococcus comes strain Me46 cell walls, on the other hand, were found to be lethal to the majority of rats inoculated, whereas those which survived did not develop acute or chronic arthritis. The results indicate that intraperitoneal injection of a single dose of cell wall fragments from bacteria that are major residents of the human anaerobic faecal flora can induce chronic inflammatory joint disease in the rat.
TI  - Induction in rats of serum agglutinins to Eubacterium, Peptostreptococcus and Coprococcus species by the faecal flora from patients with Crohn's disease and healthy subjects.
AB  - Sera from patients with Crohn's disease more often than those from other subjects contain agglutinins against anaerobic coccoid rods, identified as Peptostreptococcus productus, Eubacterium contortum (two strains) and Coprococcus comes. The presence of antigens of the four coccoid rods in faeces of patients with Crohn's disease and healthy subjects was investigated by inoculation of rats with faecal suspensions. Antigens of the coccoid rods were detected in faeces from both patients with Crohn's disease and healthy subjects.
