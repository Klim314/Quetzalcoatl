TI  == top 10 plant pathogenic bacteria in molecular plant pathology.
AB  == many plant bacteriologists, if not all, feel that their particular microbe should appear in any list of the most important bacterial plant pathogens. however, to our knowledge, no such list exists. the aim of this review was to survey all bacterial pathologists with an association with the journal molecular plant pathology and ask them to nominate the bacterial pathogens they would place in a  'top 10' based on scientific/economic importance. the survey generated 458 votes  from the international community, and allowed the construction of a top 10 bacterial plant pathogen list. the list includes, in rank order: (1) pseudomonas  syringae pathovars; (2) ralstonia solanacearum; (3) agrobacterium tumefaciens; (4) xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae; (5) xanthomonas campestris pathovars; (6) xanthomonas axonopodis pathovars; (7) erwinia amylovora; (8) xylella fastidiosa;  (9) dickeya (dadantii and solani); (10) pectobacterium carotovorum (and pectobacterium atrosepticum). bacteria garnering honourable mentions for just missing out on the top 10 include clavibacter michiganensis (michiganensis and sepedonicus), pseudomonas savastanoi and candidatus liberibacter asiaticus. this  review article presents a short section on each bacterium in the top 10 list and  its importance, with the intention of initiating discussion and debate amongst the plant bacteriology community, as well as laying down a benchmark. it will be  interesting to see, in future years, how perceptions change and which bacterial pathogens enter and leave the top 10.

TI  == the genome of erwinia tasmaniensis strain et1/99, a non-pathogenic bacterium in the genus erwinia.
AB  == the complete genome of the bacterium erwinia tasmaniensis strain et1/99 consisting of a 3.9 mb circular chromosome and five plasmids was sequenced. strain et1/99 represents an epiphytic plant bacterium related to erwinia amylovora and e. pyrifoliae, which are responsible for the important plant diseases fire blight and asian pear shoot blight, respectively. strain et1/99 is  a non-pathogenic bacterium and is thought to compete with these and other bacteria when occupying the same habitat during initial colonization. genome analysis revealed tools for colonization, cellular communication and defence modulation, as well as genes coding for the synthesis of levan and a not detected capsular exopolysaccharide. strain et1/99 may secrete indole-3-acetic acid to increase availability of nutrients provided on plant surfaces. these nutrients are subsequently accessed and metabolized. secretion systems include the hypersensitive response type iii pathway present in many pathogens. differences or missing parts within the virulence-related factors distinguish strain et1/99 from pathogens such as pectobacterium atrosepticum and the related erwinia spp. strain et1/99 completely lacks the sorbitol operon, which may also affect its inability to invade fire blight host plants. erwinia amylovora in contrast depends for virulence on utilization of sorbitol, the dominant carbohydrate in rosaceous plants. the presence of other virulence-associated factors in strain et1/99 indicates the ancestral genomic background of many plant-associated bacteria.

TI  == phylogenetic position of phytopathogens within the enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == the almost complete 16s rdna sequences of twenty nine plant-associated strains, representing species of the genera erwinia, pantoea and enterobacter were determined and compared with those of other members of the enterobacteriaceae. the species of the genus erwinia may be divided into three phylogenetic groups. cluster i represents the true erwinias and comprises e. amylovora, e. mallotivora, e. persicinus, e. psidii, e. rhapontici and e. tracheiphila. we propose to unite the species of cluster ii, e. carotovora subsp. atroseptica, e.  carotovora subsp. betavasculorum, e. carotovora subsp. carotovora, e. carotovora  subsp. odorifera, e. carotovora subsp. wasabiae, e. cacticida, e. chrysanthemi and e. cypripedii in the genus pectobacterium respectively as p. carotovorum subsp. atrosepticum comb. nov., p. carotovorum subsp. betavasculorum comb. nov.,  p. carotovorum subsp. carotovorum comb. nov., p. carotovorum subsp. odoriferum comb. nov., p. carotovorum subsp. wasabiae comb. nov., p. cacticidum comb. nov.,  p. chrysanthemi and p. cypripedii. the species e. alni, e. nigrifluens, e. paradisiaca, e. quercina, e. rubrifaciens and e. salicis, comprising cluster iii, are being classified into a new genus brenneria gen. nov. respectively as b. alni comb. nov., b. nigrifluens comb. nov., b. paradisiaca comb. nov., b. quercina comb. nov., b. rubrifaciens comb. nov. and b. salicis comb. nov. the species of the genus pantoea, included in this study, form a monophyletic unit (cluster iv), closely related with erwinia, whereas the three phytopathogenic species of the genus enterobacter are scattered among the genera citrobacter and klebsiella.
