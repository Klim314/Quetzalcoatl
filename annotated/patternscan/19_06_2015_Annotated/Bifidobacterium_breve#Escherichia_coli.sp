TI  == preparative scale purification of fucosyl-n-acetylglucosamine disaccharides and their evaluation as potential prebiotics and antiadhesins.
AB  == fucosyl-n-acetylglucosamine disaccharides are important core structures that form part of human mucosal and milk glyco-complexes. we have previously shown that alfb and alfc alpha-l-fucosidases from lactobacillus casei are able to synthesize fucosyl-alpha-1,3--n-acetylglucosamine (fuc-alpha1,3-glcnac) and fucosyl-alpha-1,6-n-acetylglucosamine (fuc-alpha1,6-glcnac), respectively, in transglycosylation reactions. here, these reactions were performed in a semipreparative scale, and the produced disaccharides were purified. the maximum  yields obtained of fuc-alpha1,3-glcnac and fuc-alpha1,6-glcnac were 4.2 and 9.3 g/l, respectively. the purified fucosyl-disaccharides were then analyzed for their prebiotic effect in vitro using strains from the lactobacillus casei/paracasei/rhamnosus group and from bifidobacterium species. the results revealed that 6 out of 11 l. casei strains and 2 out of 6 l. rhamnosus strains tested were able to ferment fuc-alpha1,3-glcnac, and l. casei bl87 and l. rhamnosus bl327 strains were also able to ferment fuc-alpha1,6-glcnac. dna hybridization experiments suggested that the metabolism of fuc-alpha1,3-glcnac in those strains relies in an alpha-l-fucosidase homologous to alfb. bifidobacterium breve and bibidobacterium pseudocatenolatum species also metabolized fuc-alpha1,3-glcnac. notably, l-fucose was excreted from all the lactobacillus and bifidobacterium strains fermenting fucosyl-disaccharides, except from strains l. rhamnosus bl358 and bl377, indicating that in these latest strains, l-fucose was catabolized. the fucosyl-disaccharides were also tested for their inhibitory  potential of pathogen adhesion to human colon adenocarcinoma epithelial (ht29) cell line. enteropathogenic escherichia coli (epec) strains isolated from infantile gastroenteritis were used, and the results showed that both fucosyl-disaccharides inhibited adhesion to different extents of certain epec strains to ht29 cells in tissue culture.

TI  == biotransformation of rutin to isoquercitrin using recombinant alpha-l-rhamnosidase from bifidobacterium breve.
AB  == objectives: to biotransform rutin into isoquercitrin. results: a alpha-l-rhamnosidase from bifidobacterium breve was produced by using escherichia coli bl21 for biotransformation of rutin to isoquercitrin. the enzyme was purified by ni(2+)-nta chromatography to yield a soluble protein with a specific  activity of 56 u protein mg(-1). the maximum enzyme activities were at ph 6.5, 55 degrees c, 20 mm rutin, and 1.2 u enzyme ml(-1). under optimal conditions, the half-life of the enzyme was 96 h. the k m and v max values were 2.2 mm, 56.4 mumol mg(-1) min(-1) and 2.1 mm, 57.5 mumol mg(-1) min(-1) using pnp-rha and rutin as substrates, respectively. the kinetic behavior indicated that the recombinant alpha-l-rhamnosidase has good catalytic performance for producing isoquercitrin. 20 mm rutin was biotransformed into 18.25 and 19.87 mm isoquercitrin after 60 and 240 min. conclusion: the specific biotransformation of rutin to isoquercitrin using recombinant alpha-l-rhamnosidase from b. breve is a  feasible method for use in industrial processes.

TI  == a gntr-type transcriptional repressor controls sialic acid utilization in bifidobacterium breve ucc2003.
AB  == bifidobacterium breve strains are numerically prevalent among the gut microbiota  of healthy, breast-fed infants. the metabolism of sialic acid, a ubiquitous monosaccharide in the infant and adult gut, by b. breve ucc2003 is dependent on a large gene cluster, designated the nan/nag cluster. this study describes the transcriptional regulation of the nan/nag cluster and thus sialic acid metabolism in b. breve ucc2003. insertion mutagenesis and transcriptome analysis revealed that the nan/nag cluster is regulated by a gntr family transcriptional repressor, designated nanr. crude cell extract of escherichia coli ec101 in which the nanr gene had been cloned and overexpressed was shown to bind to two promoter regions  within this cluster, each of which containing an imperfect inverted repeat that is believed to act as the nanr operator sequence. formation of the dna-nanr complex is prevented in the presence of sialic acid, which we had previously shown to induce transcription of this gene cluster.

TI  == two beta-galactosidases from the human isolate bifidobacterium breve dsm 20213: molecular cloning and expression, biochemical characterization and synthesis of galacto-oligosaccharides.
AB  == two beta-galactosidases, beta-gal i and beta-gal ii, from bifidobacterium breve dsm 20213, which was isolated from the intestine of an infant, were overexpressed in escherichia coli with co-expression of the chaperones groel/groes, purified to electrophoretic homogeneity and biochemically characterized. both beta-gal i and  beta-gal ii belong to glycoside hydrolase family 2 and are homodimers with native molecular masses of 220 and 211 kda, respectively. the optimum ph and temperature for hydrolysis of the two substrates o-nitrophenyl-beta-d-galactopyranoside (onpg) and lactose were determined at ph 7.0 and 50 degrees c for beta-gal i, and at ph 6.5 and 55 degrees c for beta-gal ii, respectively. the kcat/km values for  onpg and lactose hydrolysis are 722 and 7.4 mm-1s-1 for beta-gal i, and 543 and 25 mm-1s-1 for beta-gal ii. both beta-gal i and beta-gal ii are only moderately inhibited by their reaction products d-galactose and d-glucose. both enzymes were found to be very well suited for the production of galacto-oligosaccharides with  total gos yields of 33% and 44% of total sugars obtained with beta-gal i and beta-gal ii, respectively. the predominant transgalactosylation products are beta-d-galp-(1-->6)-d-glc (allolactose) and beta-d-galp-(1-->3)-d-lac, accounting together for more than 75% and 65% of the gos formed by transgalactosylation by beta-gal i and beta-gal ii, respectively, indicating that both enzymes have a propensity to synthesize beta-(1-->6) and beta-(1-->3)-linked gos. the resulting  gos mixtures contained relatively high fractions of allolactose, which results from the fact that glucose is a far better acceptor for galactosyl transfer than  galactose and lactose, and intramolecular transgalactosylation contributes significantly to the formation of this disaccharide.

TI  == bifidobacterium breve mcc-117 induces tolerance in porcine intestinal epithelial  cells: study of the mechanisms involved in the immunoregulatory effect.
AB  == bifidobacterium breve mcc-117 is able to significantly reduce the expression of inflammatory cytokines in porcine intestinal epithelial (pie) cells and to improve il-10 levels in cd4(+)cd25(high) foxp3(+) lymphocytes in response to heat-stable enterotoxigenic escherichia coli (etec) pathogen-associated molecular patterns (pamps), while the immunoregulatory effect of b. adolescentis atcc15705  was significantly lower than that observed for the mcc-117 strain. considering the different capacities of the two bifidobacterium strains to activate toll-like receptor (tlr)-2 and their differential immunoregulatory activities in pie and immune cells, we hypothesized that comparative studies with both strains could provide important information regarding the molecular mechanism(s) involved in the anti-inflammatory activity of bifidobacteria. in this work, we demonstrated that the anti-inflammatory effect of b. breve mcc-117 was achieved by a complex interaction of multiple negative regulators of tlrs as well as inhibition of multiple signaling pathways. we showed that b. breve mcc-117 reduced heat-stable  etec pamp-induced nf-kappab, p38 mapk and pi3 k activation and expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in pie cells. in addition, we demonstrated that b. breve mcc-117 may activate tlr2 synergistically and cooperatively with one or more other pattern recognition receptors (prrs), and that interactions may result in a coordinated sum of signals that induce the upregulation of a20, bcl-3, tollip and sigirr. upregulation of these negative regulators could have an important physiological impact on maintaining or reestablishing homeostatic tlr signals in pie cells. therefore, in the present study, we gained insight into the molecular mechanisms involved in the immunoregulatory effect of b. breve mcc-117.

TI  == influence of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis against group b streptococcus on  the early newborn gut composition and evaluation of the anti-streptococcus activity of bifidobacterium strains.
AB  == several factors are known to influence the early colonization of the gut in newborns. among them, the use of antibiotics on the mother during labor, referred to as intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (iap), has scarcely been investigated, although this practice is routinely used in group b streptococcus (gbs)-positive  women. this work is therefore aimed at verifying whether iap can influence the main microbial groups of the newborn gut microbiota at an early stage of microbial establishment. fifty-two newborns were recruited: 26 born by mothers negative to gbs (control group) and 26 by mothers positive to gbs and subjected to iap with ampicillin (iap group). selected microbial groups (lactobacillus spp., bidobacterium spp., bacteroides fragilis, clostridium difficile, and escherichia coli) were quantified with real-time pcr on dna extracted from newborn feces. further analysis was performed within the bidobacterium genus by using dgge after amplification with genus-specific primers. results obtained showed a significant decrease of the bifidobacteria counts after antibiotic treatment of the mother. bifidobacteria were found to be affected by iap not only quantitatively but also qualitatively. in fact, iap determined a decrement in the frequency of bidobacterium breve, bidobacterium bifidum, and bidobacterium dentium with respect to the control group. moreover, this study has preliminarily evaluated that some bifidobacterial strains, previously selected for use in infants, have antibacterial properties against gbs and are therefore potential candidates for being applied as probiotics for the prevention of gbs infections.

TI  == differential induction of antimicrobial regiii by the intestinal microbiota and bifidobacterium breve ncc2950.
AB  == the intestinal microbiota is a key determinant of gut homeostasis, which is achieved, in part, through regulation of antimicrobial peptide secretion. the aim of this study was to determine the efficiency by which members of the intestinal  microbiota induce the antimicrobial peptide regiii and to elucidate the underlying pathways. we showed that germfree mice have low levels of regiii-gamma in their ileum and colon compared to mice with different intestinal microbiota backgrounds. colonization with a microbiota of low diversity (altered schaedler flora) did not induce the expression of regiii-gamma as effectively as a complex  community (specific pathogen free). monocolonization with the probiotic bifidobacterium breve, but not with the nonprobiotic commensal escherichia coli jm83, upregulated regiii-gamma expression. induction of regiii-gamma by b. breve  was abrogated in mice lacking myd88 and ticam1 signaling. both live and heat-inactivated b. breve but not spent culture medium from b. breve induced the  expression of regiii-alpha, the human ortholog and homolog of regiii-gamma, in human colonic epithelial cells (caco-2). taken together, the results suggest that regiii-gamma expression in the intestine correlates with the richness of microbiota composition. also, specific bacteria such as bifidobacterium breve ncc2950 effectively induce regiii production in the intestine via the myd88-ticam1 pathway. treatment with this probiotic may enhance the mucosal barrier and protect the host from infection and inflammation.

TI  == bacterial lysates in food allergy prevention.
AB  == purpose of review: in the concept of food allergy prevention, no successful strategy could be identified until now. although interventional trials using probiotics, prebiotics, hydrolyzed formula and bacterial lysates early in infancy were found to reduce the incidence of atopic dermatitis, no effect on food sensitization and allergy could be shown. recent findings: studies in a farming environment showed that early contact to livestock, bacteria and moulds may upregulate the immune responses regulated via toll-like receptors and thus prevent allergy. there is increasing evidence that the unbalanced composition of  the human microbiome on human skin and mucosal surfaces may be a key player in the development of inflammatory diseases like allergy and asthma. however, during the last 5 years, this concept could not yet be verified in the interventional trials. there are few studies using bacterial lysates, for example, escherichia coli plus enterococcus faecalis in prosymbioflor and heat-killed bifidobacterium  breve and streptococcus thermophilus; however, food allergy prevalence could not  be reduced by these interventions. summary: during the last 5 years, new interventional trials addressed the use of bacterial lysates. there was only an effect on eczema in the prosymbioflor trial, whereas the trial using b. breve and s. thermophilus in a cow's milk formula showed a slight reduction of food sensitization at the age of 12 months. however, these strategies need further investigation and success seems to be restricted to certain subpopulations.

TI  == immunoregulatory effect of bifidobacteria strains in porcine intestinal epithelial cells through modulation of ubiquitin-editing enzyme a20 expression.
AB  == background: we previously showed that evaluation of anti-inflammatory activities  of lactic acid bacteria in porcine intestinal epithelial (pie) cells is useful for selecting potentially immunobiotic strains. objective: the aims of the present study were: i) to select potentially immunomodulatory bifidobacteria that beneficially modulate the toll-like receptor (tlr)-4-triggered inflammatory response in pie cells and; ii) to gain insight into the molecular mechanisms involved in the anti-inflammatory effect of immunobiotics by evaluating the role  of tlr2 and tlr negative regulators in the modulation of proinflammatory cytokine production and activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk) and nuclear  factor-kappab (nf-kappab) pathways in pie cells. results: bifidobacteria longum bb536 and b. breve m-16v strains significantly downregulated levels of interleukin (il)-8, monocyte chemotactic protein (mcp)-1 and il-6 in pie cells challenged with heat-killed enterotoxigenic escherichia coli. moreover, bb536 and m-16v strains attenuated the proinflammatory response by modulating the nf-kappab and mapk pathways. in addition, our findings provide evidence for a key role for  the ubiquitin-editing enzyme a20 in the anti-inflammatory effect of immunobiotic  bifidobacteria in pie cells. conclusions: we show new data regarding the mechanism involved in the anti-inflammatory effect of immunobiotics. several strains with immunoregulatory capabilities used a common mechanism to induce tolerance in pie cells. immunoregulatory strains interacted with tlr2, upregulated the expression of a20 in pie cells, and beneficially modulated the subsequent tlr4 activation by reducing the activation of mapk and nf-kappab pathways and the production of proinflammatory cytokines. we also show that the combination of tlr2 activation and a20 induction can be used as biomarkers to screen and select potential immunoregulatory bifidobacteria strains.

TI  == efficacy of different probiotic combinations on death and necrotizing enterocolitis in a premature rat model.
AB  == objective: the aim of the present study was to investigate the most effective probiotic combinations to prevent death and necrotizing enterocolitis (nec) in a  premature rat model. methods: one hundred fifty-eight premature sprague-dawley premature rats were enrolled. probiotic strains bifidobacterium bifidum, b longum, lactobacillus acidophilus, l plantarum, and b breve were fed as a single  strain or mixture with 2 or 3 strains for a total of 9 study groups; control groups received no exogenous probiotic supplement. fecal samples were collected for 72 hours to detect probiotic strains and pathologic strains by real-time polymerase chain reaction. colony counts of probiotic strains escherichia coli and klebsiella were compared between groups before and after 36 hours of the study period. the incidence of death and nec were compared via fisher exact test  between groups. results: the results demonstrated that l plantarum alone (p = 0.0026) and b bifidum with b longum together (p = 0.0017) were more effective in  reducing nec as compared with the control group. all of the study groups except b breve and b bifidum with b breve definitely prevented death compared with controls. b bifidum and b longum together had significantly lower mortality than  the control group (p < 0.0001). colony counts of e coli and klebsiella in stool samples were significantly decreased in the b bifidum, b longum, and l plantarum  group compared with the other study and control groups after 36 hours. conclusions: administration of a mixture of probiotic strains with b bifidum and  b longum was most effective in preventing death and nec in this animal model, and these observations provide an evidence-based strategy for designing further neonatal clinical trials.

TI  == competitive inhibition of three novel bacteria isolated from faeces of breast milk-fed infants against selected enteropathogens.
AB  == numerous in vitro and in vivo studies conducted using different probiotic micro-organisms have demonstrated their ability to interfere with the growth and  virulence of a variety of enteropathogens. the reported beneficial effects of the use of probiotics to complement antibiotic therapy or prevent diarrhoea or gastrointestinal infection in infants have increased in recent years. in the present study, we demonstrated the capacity of supernatants obtained from three novel probiotics (lactobacillus paracasei cncm i-4034, bifidobacterium breve cncm i-4035 and lactobacillus rhamnosus cncm i-4036) isolated from the faeces of breastfed infants to inhibit the growth of enterotoxigenic and enteropathogenic (epec) bacteria, such as escherichia coli, salmonella and shigella. to assess their potential antimicrobial activity, the 17 and 24 h cell-free supernatants broth concentrates (10x) having 1, 2 or 4 % of the three probiotics were incubated with epec bacteria strains. after 17 h of co-culture, the supernatants  were able to inhibit the growth of e. coli, salmonella and shigella up to 40, 55  and 81 %, respectively. however, the inhibitory capacity of some supernatants was maintained or completely lost when the supernatants (ph 3.0) were neutralised (ph 6.5). overall, these results demonstrated that l. paracasei cncm i-4034, b. breve cncm i-4035 and l. rhamnosus cncm i-4036 produce compounds that exhibited strain-specific inhibition of enterobacteria and have the potential to be used as probiotics in functional foods.

TI  == assessment of the in vitro inhibitory activity of specific probiotic bacteria against different escherichia coli strains.
AB  == background: lactobacilli and bifidobacteria are often associated with health-promoting effects. these live microorganisms, defined as probiotics, are commonly consumed as part of fermented foods, such as yoghurt and fermented milks, or as dietary supplements. escherichia coli is a gram-negative, rod-shaped bacterium commonly found in the lower intestine of warm-blooded organisms. as a part of the normal gut microbiota, this microorganism colonizes the gastrointestinal tract of animals and humans within a few hours after birth. all  e. coli strains can produce a wide variety of biogenic amines responsible for potentially harmful systemic intoxications. enterohemorrhagic e. coli serotype o157:h7 is a pathotype of diarrhoeagenic strains with a large virulence plasmid po157 able to produce 1 or more shiga toxins. methods: the overall aim of this study was to determine the inhibitory effects of different strains of probiotics  on e. coli serotypes, including e. coli o157:h7 (cq9485). in particular, the antagonistic activity of 4 bifidobacterium strains (probiotical spa, italy) and 16 lactic acid bacteria, more specifically 14 lactobacillus spp. and 2 streptococcus spp., was assessed against selected e. coli biotypes (atcc 8739, atcc 10536, atcc 35218, and atcc 25922). the diarrhoeagenic serotype o157:h7 was  also tested. results: the experimental data collected demonstrated an in vitro significant inhibitory effect of 6 lactobacillus strains, namely l. rhamnosus lr04, l. rhamnosus lr06, l. plantarum lp01, l. plantarum lp02, l. pentosus lps01, and l. delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii ldd01, and 2 bifidobacterium strains, b. breve br03 and b. breve b632. the inhibiting extent was slightly different among  these strains, with l. delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii ldd01 showing the highest activity on e. coli o157:h7. conclusions: most of the probiotics studied are able to antagonize the growth of the 5 strains of e. coli tested, including the o157:h7 biotype, well known for their characteristic to produce a wide variety of biogenic amines considered responsible for dangerous systemic intoxications.

TI  == cloning and characterization of ginsenoside ra1-hydrolyzing beta-d-xylosidase from bifidobacterium breve k-110.
AB  == beta-d-xylosidase (e.c. 3.2.1.37) from bifidobacterium breve k-110, which hydrolyzes ginsenoside ra1 to ginsenoside rb2, was cloned and expressed in escherichia coli. the (his6)-tagged recombinant enzyme, designated as xlybk- 110, was efficiently purified using ni(2)(+)-affinity chromatography (109.9-fold, 84%  yield). the molecular mass of xylbk- 100 was found to be 55.7 kda by sds-page. its sequence revealed a 1,347 bp open reading frame (orf) encoding a protein containing 448 amino acids, which showed 82% identity (dna) to the previously reported glycosyl hydrolase family 30 of bifidobacterium adolescentis atcc 15703. the km and vmax values toward p-nitrophenyl-beta-d-xylopyranoside (pnpx) were 1.45mm and 10.75 micromol/min/mg, respectively. this enzyme had ph and temperature optima at 6.0 and 45 degrees c, respectively. xylbk-110 acted to the  greatest extent on xyloglucosyl kakkalide, followed by pnpx and ginsenoside ra1,  but did not act on p-nitrophenyl-alpha-larabinofuranoside, p-nitrophenyl-beta-d-glucopyranoside, or p-nitrophenyl-beta-d-fucopyranoside. in  conclusion, this is the first report on the cloning and expression of beta-dxylosidase- hydrolyzing ginsenoside ra1 and kakkalide from human intestinal microflora.

TI  == overexpression and characterization of a novel transgalactosylic and hydrolytic beta-galactosidase from a human isolate bifidobacterium breve b24.
AB  == after the complete gene of a beta-galactosidase from human isolate bifidobacterium breve b24 was isolated by pcr and overexpressed in e. coli, the recombinant beta-galactosidase was purified to homogeneity and characterized for  the glycoside transferase (gt) and glycoside hydrolase (gh) activities on lactose. one complete orf encoding 691 amino acids (2,076 bp) was the structural  gene, laca (gala) of the beta-gal gene. the recombinant enzyme shown by activity  staining and gel-filtration chromatography was composed of a homodimer of 75 kda  with a total molecular mass of 150 kda. the k(m) value for lactose (95.58 mm) was 52.5-fold higher than the corresponding k(m) values for the synthetic substrate onpg (1.82 mm). this enzyme with the optimum of ph 7.0 and 45 degrees c could synthesize approximately 42.00% of gos from 1m of lactose. about 97.00% of lactose in milk was also quickly hydrolyzed by this enzyme (50 units) at 45 degrees c for 5h to produce 46.30% of glucose, 46.60% of galactose and 7.10% of gos. the results suggest that this recombinant beta-galactosidase derived from a  human isolate b. breve b24 may be suitable for both the hydrolysis and synthesis  of galacto-oligosaccharides (gos) in milk and lactose processing.

TI  == cloning and characterization of alpha-l-arabinofuranosidase and bifunctional alpha-l-arabinopyranosidase/beta-d-galactopyranosidase from bifidobacterium longum h-1.
AB  == aims: this study focused on the cloning, expression and characterization of recombinant alpha-l-arabinosidases from bifidobacterium longum h-1. methods and results: alpha-l-arabinofuranosidase (afub-h1) and bifunctional alpha-l-arabinopyranosidase/beta-d-galactosidase (apy-h1) from b. longum h-1 were identified by southern blotting, and their recombinant enzymes were overexpressed in escherichia coli bl21 (de3). recombinant afub-h1 (rafub-h1) was purified by single-step ni(2+) -affinity column chromatography, whereas recombinant apy-h1 (rapy-h1) was purified by serial q-hp and ni(2+) -affinity column chromatography. enzymatic properties and substrate specificities of the two enzymes were assessed, and their kinetic constants were calculated. according to the results,  rafub-h1 hydrolysed p-nitrophenyl-alpha-l-arabinofuranoside (pnp-alphal-af) and ginsenoside rc, but did not hydrolyse p-nitrophenyl-alpha-l-arabinopyranoside (pnp-alphal-ap). on the other hand, rapy-h1 hydrolysed pnp-alphal-ap, p-nitrophenyl-beta-d-galactopyranoside (pnp-betad-ga) and ginsenoside rb2. conclusions: ginsenoside-metabolizing bifidobacterial rafub-h1 and rapy-h1 were successfully cloned, expressed, and characterized. rafub-h1 specifically recognized the alpha-l-arabinofuranoside, whereas rapy-h1 had dual functions, that is, it could hydrolyse both beta-d-galactopyranoside and alpha-l-arabinopyranoside. significance and impact of the study: these findings suggest that the biochemical properties and substrate specificities of these recombinant enzymes differ from those of previously identified alpha-l-arabinosidases from bifidobacterium breve k-110 and clostridium cellulovorans.

TI  == toll-like receptor-2-activating bifidobacteria strains differentially regulate inflammatory cytokines in the porcine intestinal epithelial cell culture system:  finding new anti-inflammatory immunobiotics.
AB  == a total of 23 strains of bifidobacteria taxonomically belonging to five species were tested for their potent immunomodulatory effect using a combination of two methods: the nf-kappab-reporter assay using a toll-like receptor 2-expressing transfectant (hek(ptlr2) system) and the mitogenic assay using porcine peyer's patches immunocompetent cells. among the four preselected strains from different  immunomodulatory groups, bifidobacterium breve mcc-117 was able to efficiently modulate the inflammatory response triggered by enterotoxigenic escherichia coli  (etec) in a porcine intestinal epithelial (pie) cell line. moreover, using pie cells and swine peyer's patches immunocompetent cell co-culture system, we demonstrated that the immunoregulatory effect of b. breve mcc-117 was related to  the capacity of the strain to influence pie and immune cell interactions, leading to the stimulation of regulatory t cells. the results suggested that bifidobacteria that express high activity in both the hek(ptlr2) and the mitogenic assays may behave like potential anti-inflammatory strains. the combination of the hek(ptlr2) system, the evaluation of mitogenic activity and pie cells will be of value for the development of new immunologically functional  foods and feeds that could prevent inflammatory intestinal disorders. although our findings should be proven in appropriate experiments in vivo, the results of  the present work provide a scientific rationale for the use of b. breve mcc-117 to prevent etec-induced intestinal inflammation.

TI  == the role of hemagglutination and effect of exopolysaccharide production on bifidobacteria adhesion to caco-2 cells in vitro.
AB  == it is believed that an important criterion for a potential probiotic strain is that it is capable of adhering to mucosal surfaces in the human gastrointestinal  tract. the purpose of this study was to investigate a possible relationship between exopolysaccharide production and adhesion to caco-2 cells by bifidobacterium breve a28 and bifidobacterium bifidum a10. in a preselection process, the hemagglutination abilities of these bacteria were determined prior to undertaking adhesion studies. b. breve a28, which produces large amounts of eps (97.00 +/- 2.00 mg/l) and has good hemagglutination abilities (+3) was found  to adhere strongly to caco-2 cells. under gastrointestinal conditions, the high eps producing- b. breve a28 was found to have better viability and adhesion to caco-2 cells than the low eps producing- b. bifidum a10. also, b. breve a28 was found to be more effective at inhibiting escherichia coli atcc 11229 than b. bifidum a10. this investigation showed that high eps production and adhesion ability may be important in the selection of bifidobacteria as probiotic strains.

TI  == the influence of some probiotic supernatants on the growth and virulence features expression of several selected enteroaggregative e. coli clinical strains.
AB  == the purpose of this study was the assessment of the influence of three probiotic  supernatants (bifidobacterium breve atcc 15700, enterococcus faecium atcc 19434,  lactobacillus casei subsp. casei atcc 393) on the growth (quantified by viable cell counts) and virulence features expression (adherence ability to hep-2 cells  and inert substratum- slime test) of several selected eaggec diarrhoeagenic strains as well as the cytotoxicity of the respective supernatants on hep-2 cells. results: our in vitro studies are demonstrating that the selected supernatants, when added simultaneously with the bacterial culture are generally  opposing to the adherence to the cellular substratum by the eaggec strains. when  added after the pre-adherence period, the supernatants did not change the adherence indexes of the eaggec strains, but induced slight changes in the adherence pattern, reducing the frequency and size of bacterial aggregates. only  in few cases, the bacterial growth rate was slightly increased or sustained by the probiotic supernatants, a possible explanation being that we used supernatants obtained from 24 hrs fresh cultures, which are probably still containing some nutrients and probably also other growth factors. conclusion: our results are demonstrating that soluble probiotic metabolites accumulated in culture supernatants may interfere with the first step of adherence and colonization of the cellular and inert substrata by eaggec strains, probablyby the cross-talk between probiotic soluble molecules and quorum-sensing mediators of opportunistic strains; so, direct contact between the probiotic and pathogenic bacteria are not always necessary for the occurrence of a protective effect, that could be partly mediated by the soluble molecules secreted by specific probiotic  strains.

AB  == the growth-inhibiting activities of sinapis alba l. seed-derived materials were examined on the growth of bifidobacterium bifidum, b. breve, b. longum, clostridium difficile, c. perfringens, escherichia coli, lactobacillus acidophilus, and l. casei. the active component of s. alba seeds was purified using silica gel column chromatography and hplc and was identified as phenethyl isothiocyanate by various spectroscopic analyses. the antimicrobial activity of phenethyl isothiocyanate varied according to the dose and bacterial strain tested. phenethyl isothiocyanate strongly inhibited the growth of c. difficile and c. perfringens at 1 mg/disc, and weakly (+) inhibited its growth at 0.1 mg/disc. furthermore, phenethyl isothiocyanate moderately (++) inhibited the growth of e. coli at a dose of 2 mg/disc, but did not inhibit the growth of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. addition of various functional groups to isothiocyanates resulted in selective inhibitory activity against harmful bacteria with low concentrations of aromatic isothiocyanates demonstrating greater inhibitory activity against clostridia and e. coli than aliphatic isothiocyanates. in conclusion, aromatic isothiocyanates containing phenethyl-, benzyl-, and benzoyl-groups might be useful in the development of novel preventive and therapeutic agents against diseases caused by harmful intestinal bacteria.

TI  == bile-inducible efflux transporter from bifidobacterium longum ncc2705, conferring bile resistance.
AB  == bifidobacteria are normal inhabitants of the human gut. some strains of this genus are considered health promoting or probiotic, being included in numerous food products. in order to exert their health benefits, these bacteria must overcome biological barriers, including bile salts, to colonize and survive in specific parts of the intestinal tract. the role of multidrug resistance (mdr) transporters in bile resistance of probiotic bacteria and the effect of bile on probiotic gene expression are not fully understood. in the present study, the effect of subinhibitory concentrations of bile on the expression levels of predicted mdr genes from three different bifidobacterial strains, belonging to bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum, bifidobacterium breve, and bifidobacterium  animalis subsp. lactis, was tested. in this way, two putative mdr genes whose expression was induced by bile, bl0920 from b. longum and its homolog, bbr0838, from b. breve, were identified. the expression of the bl0920 gene in escherichia  coli was shown to confer resistance to bile, likely to be mediated by active efflux from the cells. to the best of our knowledge, this represents the first identified bifidobacterial bile efflux pump whose expression is induced by bile.

TI  == characterization of plasmids from human infant bifidobacterium strains: sequence  analysis and construction of e. coli-bifidobacterium shuttle vectors.
AB  == a survey of infant fecal bifidobacterium isolates for plasmid dna revealed that a significant portion of the strains, 17.6%, carry small plasmids. the majority of  plasmid-harboring strains belonged to the bifidobacterium longum/infantis group.  most of the plasmids could be assigned into two groups based on their sizes and the restriction profiles. three plasmids, pb44 (3.6 kb) from b. longum, pb80 (4.9 kb) from bifidobacterium bifidum, and pb21a (5.2kb) from bifidobacterium breve were sequenced. while the former two plasmids were found to be highly similar to  previously characterized rolling-circle replicating pkj36 and pkj56, respectively, the third plasmid, pb21a, does not share significant nucleotide homology with known plasmids. however, it might be placed into the pcibb1-like group of bifidobacterial rolling-plasmids based on the homology of its rep protein and the overall molecular organization. two sets of escherichia coli-bifidobacterium shuttle vectors constructed based on pb44 and pb80 replicons were capable of transforming b. bifidum and b. breve strains with efficiency up to 3x10(4)cfu/microg dna. additionally, an attempt was made to employ a broad host range conjugation element, rp4, in developing of e. coli-bifidobacterium gene transfer system.

TI  == effects of rosa rugosa petals on intestinal bacteria.
AB  == the effects of pulverized petal of rosa rugosa on the growth of 10 species of intestinal and pathogenic bacteria were investigated. growth of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli was not affected by the addition of the petal in plate cultivation. however, the growth of bacteroides vulgatus, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, and bacillus cereus was completely inhibited by the addition of 0.1, 0.5, 0.1, and 0.05% (w/v) of the petal respectively. in liquid cultivation, the addition of the petal (0.5%) stimulated the growth of bifidobacterium breve and slightly inhibited the growth of lactobacillus salivarius. but the growth of e. coli, s. aureus, b. cereus, and salmonella sp. was inhibited by nearly 50%. hydrolyzable tannins isolated from r. rugosa, rugosin d, and tellimagradin ii showed antibacterial activities against e. coli,  s. aureus, b. cereus, and salmonella sp., but little or no effect against bif. breve and l. salivarius. r. rugosa petal showed selective antibacterial activities against intestinal and pathogenic bacteria, and the selectivity resembled that of prebiotics such as oligosaccharides and dietary fiber. hydrolyzable tannins in r. rugosa, such as rugosin d and tellimagradin ii, must be active constituents.

TI  == surface expression of toll-like receptor 9 is upregulated on intestinal epithelial cells in response to pathogenic bacterial dna.
AB  == colonic epithelial cells are constantly exposed to high levels of bacterial dna in the intestinal lumen and must recognize and respond appropriately to pathogens, while they maintain a tolerance to nonpathogenic commensal bacterial strains. bacterial dna is recognized by toll-like receptor 9 (tlr9). the aim of this study was to investigate tlr9 expression and localization in colonic epithelial cells under basal conditions and in response to bacterial dna. ht-29 cells were exposed to dna from various strains of commensal and pathogenic microbes. tlr9 mrna expression was determined by real-time reverse transcription-pcr, and interleukin-8 (il-8) secretion was measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. localization of tlr9 was determined by flow cytometry in ht-29 cells and by immunofluorescence in ht-29 cells and mouse colonic tissue. immunofluorescence and flow cytometric analyses demonstrated that there was intracellular and surface expression of tlr9 in ht-29 cells under basal conditions. exposure of cells to dna from pathogenic strains of salmonella and escherichia coli resulted in a significant increase in tlr9 mrna expression. salmonella enterica serovar dublin dna increased surface tlr9 protein and il-8 secretion. there was no change in mrna levels or localization of tlr9 in response to bifidobacterium breve. chloroquine did not block il-8 secretion in response to s. enterica serovar dublin dna. tlr9 was expressed on the colonic apical surface  in wild-type mice but not in germfree mice. these results demonstrate that intestinal epithelial cells recognize pathogenic bacterial dna and respond by increasing surface localization and expression of tlr9, suggesting that the epithelial inflammatory response to pathogenic dna is mediated at least in part by increased tlr9 expression.

TI  == a longitudinal study of infant faecal microbiota during weaning.
AB  == for infants, the introduction of food other than breast milk is a high risk period due to diarrheal diseases, and may be corroborated with a shift in the faecal microbiota. this longitudinal study was the first undertaken to understand the effect of the supplementation on the infant's faecal microbiota and particularly the bifidobacteria. eleven infants were enrolled. their faecal microbiota were analysed using temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis  (ttge) with bacterial and bifidobacterial primers. in parallel, bifidobacterial counts were followed using competitive pcr. three periods were distinguished: exclusive breastfeeding (bf period), weaning (i.e. formula-milk addition, w period) and postweaning (i.e. breastfeeding cessation, pw period). the bifidobacterial counts were not modified, reaching 10.5 (log10 cells g(-1) wet weight). in the ttge profiles, the main identified bands corresponded to escherichia coli, ruminococcus sp. and bifidobacterium sp., more precisely bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium infantis and bifidobacterium breve. for both ttge profiles, the analysis of the distance suggested a maturation of the faecal microbiota but no correlation could be established with the diet. despite  a high interindividual variability, composition of the faecal microbiota appeared more homogenous after weaning and this point may be correlated with the cessation of breastfeeding.

TI  == bifidobacterium breve and streptococcus thermophilus secretion products enhance t helper 1 immune response and intestinal barrier in mice.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria or their secretion products can modulate immune responses differently in normal and inflammatory conditions. this comparative study analyzes the effect of oral administration of living lactic acid bacteria, or their conditioned media, on the epithelial and immune functions of colitis-prone  c57bl/6 il-10-deficient mice. mice were untreated (control) or infected with helicobacter hepaticus with or without oral treatment with living bacteria, bifidobacterium breve c50 and streptococcus thermophilus 065 (lb), or their culture-conditioned media (cm). histology, cytokine mrna, electrical resistance,  and barrier capacity of colonic samples as well as cytokine secretion by mesenteric lymph node (mln) cells were studied. helicobacter hepaticus mice developed only mild colitis, which was not modified in lb or cm groups. in the cm (but not the lb) group, the colonic barrier was reinforced as compared to the other groups, as evidenced by decreased horseradish peroxidase (hrp) transcytosis and mannitol fluxes and increased electrical resistance. in mln, the percentage of cd4+ and cd8+ t cells secreting ifngamma was significantly higher in cm (2.06% and 1.98%, respectively) mice than in h. hepaticus (1.1% and 0.47%, p < 0.05) or  control mice. in addition, the nonspecific stimulation of ifngamma, tnfalpha, and il-12 secretion by mln cells was significantly higher in the cm group as compared to the other groups. in the absence of severe colitis, bifidobacterium breve c50- and streptococcus thermophilus 065-conditioned media can reinforce intestinal barrier capacity and stimulate th1 immune response, highlighting the involvement  of lactic acid bacteria-derived components in host defense.

AB  == alpha-d-galactosidase gene (agal) of bifidobacterium breve 203 was cloned into temperature expression vector pbv220 and transformed into e. coli. the recombinant plasmid pbvagal was induced to express with temperature. the specific activities of recombinant enzyme agal in e. coli dh5alpha, e. coli dh10b and e. coli bl21 were 28.08 u/mg, 19.44 u/mg and 13.85 u/mg, respectively. the recombinant plasmid pbvagal is more stable in e. coli bl21. the molecular weight  of agal as determined by sds-page was about 67 kd. the optimum ph of agal was ph  4.0-4.4, and it was stable between ph 3.6 and 6.0 (kept at 4 degrees c overnight). the optimum temperature of agal was 45 degrees c, and it was stable below 40 degrees c (incubated for 30 min). km-values for p-nitrophenyl-alpha-galactopyranoside (pnpgal) and melibiose were calculated with 1.43 mmol/l and 261 mmol/l, respectively. no transgalactosylation activity was found when agal hydrolyzed melibiose or raffinose. the results suggest that agal  is much different from reported alpha-d-galactosidase from bi. breve 203. agal is another kind of alpha-d-galactosidase in the same bifidobacteria strain.

TI  == probiotic bifidobacteria protect mice from lethal infection with shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli o157:h7.
AB  == the anti-infectious activity of probiotic bifidobacteria against shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli (stec) o157:h7 was examined in a fatal mouse stec infection model. stable colonization of the murine intestines was achieved by the oral administration of bifidobacterium breve strain yakult (naturally resistant to streptomycin sulfate) as long as the mice were treated with streptomycin in their drinking water (5 mg/ml). the pathogenicity of stec infection, characterized by marked body weight loss and subsequent death, observed in the infected controls was dramatically inhibited in the b. breve-colonized group. moreover, stx production by stec cells in the intestine was almost completely inhibited in the b. breve-colonized group. a comparison of  anti-stec activity among several bifidobacterium strains with natural resistance  to streptomycin revealed that strains such as bifidobacterium bifidum atcc 15696  and bifidobacterium catenulatum atcc 27539(t) did not confer an anti-infectious activity, despite achieving high population levels similar to those of effective  strains, such as b. breve strain yakult and bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum dsm 20439. the effective strains produced a high concentration of acetic acid (56 mm) and lowered the ph of the intestine (to ph 6.75) compared to the infected control group (acetic acid concentration, 28 mm; ph, 7.15); these effects were thought to be related to the anti-infectious activity of these strains because the combination of a high concentration of acetic acid and a low ph was found to inhibit stx production during stec growth in vitro.

TI  == production and application of new monoclonal antibodies specific for a fecal helicobacter pylori antigen.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to establish monoclonal antibodies that could be used to produce a diagnostic test composed of one kind of monoclonal antibody recognizing a fecal helicobacter pylori antigen. the need to develop such a test  arose from disadvantages of the diagnostic test that uses a polyclonal antibody or plural kinds of monoclonal antibodies, such as the lower specificity for h. pylori antigen and the difficulty of reproduction with consistent quality. mice were immunized with sonicated cells of the coccoid form of h. pylori, and fecal samples from h. pylori-positive subjects were screened by a direct sandwich enzyme immunoassay (eia) for antibody production from 32 hybridoma clones. the three stable clones produced antibodies (21g2, 41a5, and 82b9) that reacted with  the same soluble antigen. gel filtration chromatography showed that the molecular masses of the cellular antigen and the fecal antigen were the same, 260 kda. the  antigen was labile in response to sodium dodecyl sulfate and heat treatments. a single-step direct sandwich eia using a single monoclonal antibody, 21g2, was developed. the eia could detect the antigen in 41 h. pylori clinical isolates and in fecal samples from seven h. pylori-positive subjects. several kinds of helicobacter species (helicobacter felis, helicobacter hepaticus, helicobacter mustelae, and helicobacter cinaedi) except h. pylori, major bacteria in feces (campylobacter jejuni, bacteroides vulgatus, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium infantis, and escherichia coli), and fecal samples from six h. pylori-negative subjects showed negative results. these results indicate that the new monoclonal antibodies and the new specific eia would be useful as a noninvasive method of diagnosis of h. pylori infection.

TI  == ability of lactoferrin to promote the growth of bifidobacterium spp. in vitro is  independent of receptor binding capacity and iron saturation level.
AB  == lactoferrin (lf) is an iron-binding protein which has been shown to inhibit the growth of various bacterial pathogens and promote the growth of anaerobic bacteria of the genus bifidobacterium in vitro. the present study was designed to investigate whether the bifidobacteria growth promotion activity of lf is correlated with either the binding of lf to bifidobacterial cells or the iron saturation of lf. bovine lf (blf) from mature milk increased the growth of b. infantis and b. breve in vitro in a dose-dependent fashion, while much less growth promotion activity was found for b. bifidum. in contrast, human lf (hulf)  from mature milk promoted the growth of b. bifidum and was inactive for b. infantis and b. breve, while blf from colostrum was devoid of bifidobacteria growth promotion activity. changes in the iron content of lf did not alter the bifidobacteria growth promotion activity of either blf or hulf preparations. competitive binding studies with biotinylated milk blf showed that binding of blf was inhibited by unlabelled blf and hulf but not by beta-lactoglobulin, alpha-lactalbumin or transferrin. binding of blf to b. bifidum and b. breve was c. 40-fold higher than binding to escherichia coli. colostrum blf was also found  to bind to b. bifidum and b. breve, despite a lack of in-vitro growth promotion activity. collectively, these results demonstrate that the ability of lf to promote the growth of bifidobacterium spp. in vitro is independent of the iron saturation level for lf and suggest that binding of lf to bifidobacteria cells may be involved but is not sufficient for stimulation of bifidobacterial growth.

AB  == the role of intestinal bacteria in induction and repression of ulcer formation in the ileum of rats treated with one of the nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (nsaids), 5-bromo-2-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-(4-methylsulfonylphenyl) thiophene (bfmet), was examined in this study. bfmet was administered by intragastric gavage once at doses of 500-1,500 mg/kg of body weight to wistar rats treated with and without antibiotics (bacitracin, neomycin, streptomycin), germ-free rats and gnotobiotic rats, and 72 hr later their gastrointestinal tracts were examined for ulcer formation. a single oral administration of bfmet induced ileal ulcers in specific pathogen-free rats. however, the rats given antibiotics to reduce the intestinal bacteria had no ulcers. bfmet-treated germ-free rats and gnotobiotic rats mono-associated with bifidobacterium adolescentis or lactobacillus acidophilus also had no intestinal ulcers. however, the drug induced ileal ulcers in gnotobiotic rats mono-associated with eubacterium limosum or escherichia coli. an overnight culture of b. adolescentis or l. acidophilus or yogurt containing bifidobacterium breve and streptococcus thermophilus, when given as drinking water, inhibited ulcer formation in the ileum of rats treated with bfmet. gram staining of the ileal contents of normal rats revealed that 97.4% of the stained  microorganisms were gram-positive rods and only 1.2% were gram-negative rods. in  the group of rats with ulcers induced by bfmet, the gram-positive rods decreased  by 56.4% and the gram-negative rods including escherichia coli, klebsiella, proteus and bacteroides increased by 37.3%. however, in the group of rats administered the bifidobacterium culture, the lactobacillus culture or yogurt, the percentages of the gram-negative rods were decreased. although lactobacillus  was a major bacterium in the ileum of normal rats, the gram-negative facultatively anaerobic rods e.coli, klebsiella and proteus were increased in the ulcerated ileum of rats treated with bfmet, suggesting that these bacteria are associated with ulcer formation in rats treated with nsaids, and that lactobacillus and bifidobacterium inhibit it by repressing the growth of ulcer-inducing bacteria.

TI  == [effect of biapenem (l-627) on fecal flora in gnotobiotic mice and children].
AB  == biapenem (l-627), a novel injectable carbapenem antibiotic, was studied with regard to its effect on mice inoculated with four types of bacteria and on the intestinal flora of pediatric patients. l-627 was given i.m., 40 mg/kg once daily for 5 consecutive days, to mice inoculated enterically with four types of bacteria (escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, bacteroides fragilis, and bifidobacterium breve). except for a mild decrease in e. coli, there were no major fluctuations in viable bacterial counts in the feces during the treatment.  five children with bacterial infections (3 boys and 2 girls; ages: 1 month to 7 years and 7 months; body weights 4.62-21.8 kg) were given l-627 at 6.0 to 11.7 mg/kg 3 times daily for 7 to 11 days. among aerobes, although enterobacteriaceae  such as e. coli tended to decrease remarkably in all patients, there was no major change in enterococcus. consequently, total aerobe counts did not change significantly in any patient. among anaerobes, bifidobacterium, bacteroides, and  eubacterium, which are the predominant organisms in infants, decreased remarkably in some patients. one of the patients showed a marked decrease in total anaerobe  count associated with a change in fecal characteristics (diarrhea). glucose nonfermenting gram-negative bacilli or fungi did not become predominant organisms in any patient. recovery from these changes in the intestinal flora was noted promptly after terminating l-627 treatment. l-627 was detected in the feces of 4  patients during treatment. the fecal concentration ranged from 0.24 to 2.22 micrograms/g. clostridium difficile was not detected in any patient. although c.  difficile d-1 antigen was observed in 2 patients, it bore no relationship to fecal properties. the results indicated that l-627 had relatively few effects on  the intestinal flora compared to other new beta-lactam antibiotics.

TI  == adhesion of human bifidobacterial strains to cultured human intestinal epithelial cells and inhibition of enteropathogen-cell interactions.
AB  == thirteen human bifidobacterial strains were tested for their abilities to adhere  to human enterocyte-like caco-2 cells in culture. the adhering strains were also  tested for binding to the mucus produced by the human mucus-secreting ht29-mtx cell line in culture. a high level of calcium-independent adherence was observed  for bifidobacterium breve 4, for bifidobacterium infantis 1, and for three fresh  human isolates from adults. as observed by scanning electron microscopy, adhesion occurs to the apical brush border of the enterocytic caco-2 cells and to the mucus secreted by the ht29-mtx mucus-secreting cells. the bacteria interacted with the well-defined apical microvilli of caco-2 cells without cell damage. the  adhesion to caco-2 cells of bifidobacteria did not require calcium and was mediated by a proteinaceous adhesion-promoting factor which was present both in the bacterial whole cells and in the spent supernatant of bifidobacterium culture. this adhesion-promoting factor appeared species specific, as are the adhesion-promoting factors of lactobacilli. we investigated the inhibitory effect of adhering human bifidobacterial strains against intestinal cell monolayer colonization by a variety of diarrheagenic bacteria. b. breve 4, b. infantis 1, and fresh human isolates were shown to inhibit cell association of enterotoxigenic, enteropathogenic, diffusely adhering escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium strains to enterocytic caco-2 cells in a concentration-dependent manner. moreover, b. breve 4 and b. infantis 1 strains inhibited, dose dependently, caco-2 cell invasion by enteropathogenic e. coli, yersinia pseudotuberculosis, and s. typhimurium strains.

TI  == [influence of s-1108 on intestinal bacterial flora].
AB  == the effect of s-1108, a new oral cephem antibiotic, on intestinal bacterial flora was studied in tetra-contaminated mice and pediatric patients. s-1108 in a fine granular form was administered at a dose of 15 mg/kg once a day for 5 consecutive days to mice infected with escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, bacteroides fragilis and bifidobacterium breve. the viable fecal bacterial cell count of each of these 4 species of bacteria was slightly reduced in 5 days after the start of  the drug administration. five boys (weighing 12.0 to 42.0 kg) with bacterial infections were entered into this pediatric study. their ages ranged from 2 years 4 months to 9 years 3 months. s-1108 (fine granules) was administered at a dose of 2.3 to 6.0 mg/kg, 3 times a day for 5 to 11 days. cell counts of primary aerobes, anaerobes and total anaerobic cells decreased markedly in three patients, but in the remaining two patients the total number of aerobic and anaerobic cells did not change appreciably. glucose-nonfermentating gram-negative rods did not become predominant during the period of s-1108 administration. candida became predominant in the three patients in whom the other bacteria had markedly decreased. counts of predominant aerobic and anaerobic bacteria decreased markedly during the regimen in 3 out of 5 cases. s-1006 was detected in stools of the 3 cases at concentrations ranging from 235 to 516 micrograms/g during the administration of s-1108. intestinal bacteria that produce beta-lactamase were not present in the feces of any of the patients. based on these results, s-1108 (fine granules) appears to have relatively little effect on intestinal bacterial flora similarly to other new oral cephems. because of individual differences, however, the drug may be excreted in the feces at high concentrations, and this would result in changes in intestinal bacterial flora. therefore, attention must be given to fecal drug concentrations.

TI  == [the influence of cefdinir on the intestinal bacterial flora].
AB  == the influence of cefdinir (cfdn), a new oral cephalosporin, on the intestinal bacterial flora was studied in tetra-contaminated mice and in pediatric patients. cfdn in fine granules was administered at a dose of 10 mg/kg once a day for 5 consecutive days to mice contaminated with 4 different species of organism: escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, bacteroides fragilis and bifidobacterium breve. no remarkable changes were observed in the fecal viable cell counts except that decreases in e. coli counts were observed on the day 3 to 5 after starting administration. the subjects in pediatric study were 7 children with infections,  3 boys and 4 girls, with their ages from 6 months to 12 years 7 months. their body weights ranged from 5.5 to 29.2 kg. cfdn fine granules was administered at each dose of 3.0 mg/kg to 3.7 mg/kg, 3 times a day for 4 to 14 days. during the administration of cfdn, some variations were observed in the pattern of changes in the fecal bacterial flora between subjects. although enterobacteriaceae and total counts of anaerobes were markedly decreased in 2 cases, total counts of aerobes were unchanged in the 2 cases, whereas main aerobes and anaerobes except  enterococci hardly varied in the other cases. there was no case in which glucose  non-fermenting gram-negative rods and fungi became predominant species continually. although clostridium difficile and c. difficile d-1 antigens were detected in 1 and 4 cases, respectively, no relationship was found between the number of c. difficile and the characteristics of the feces. with regard to the drug sensitivities of bacteria isolated from feces before and after administration of cfdn, higher levels of resistance were found in some bacteria such as enterococcus and bacteroides during or after administration than before administration. cfdn was detected in fecal samples from 2 cases during administration with concentrations ranging between 0.99-254 micrograms/g. high value of cfdn was found in a case with low beta-lactamase activity in feces, in which marked decrease of enterobacteriaceae and total counts of anaerobes was observed. the above results suggest that cfdn is considered to be a drug with relatively small influence on the intestinal bacterial flora. but as high concentrations of drugs were detected in feces under some circumstances, our attention will be required. particular care is also required for the occurrence of diarrhea and microbial replacement during continuous, long-term administration of the drug.

TI  == [the range of antigenic specificity of bifidobacterium peptidoglycan].
AB  == the antigenic relationships of bifidobacterium bifidum 1 peptidoglycans with different strains of this species (lva-3, 791, go-4), bifidobacteria of other species (b. adolescentis go-13, b. breve 79-38, b. lactentis 79-41, b. longum go-3) and bacteria of remote taxonomic groups (streptococcus faecalis 6-3. staphylococcus aureus com 885, s. epidermidis com 2124. lactobacillus plantarum 1, escherichia coli m-17) were studied on the basis of a highly sensitive test system permitting the registration of normal human antibodies to peptidoglycans.  the level of cross reactions with staphylococci and streptococci correspond to intraspecific and antigenic affinity to l. plantarum and e. coli was considerably less pronounced. copying a number of epitopes of bifidobacteria, s. aureus peptidoglycan seems to possess additional antigenic determinants which participate in the formation of immunological responsiveness in man.

TI  == [influence of cefodizime on intestinal bacterial flora].
AB  == effects of cefodizime (cdzm), a new injectable cephem antibiotic, on the intestinal bacterial flora were studied in tetra-contaminated mice and in pediatric patients. cdzm was intramuscularly administered at a dose of 100 mg/kg  once a day for 5 consecutive days to mice contaminated with 4 different species of organisms: escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, bacteroides fragilis and bifidobacterium breve. for 3 species except e. faecalis, bacterial populations in feces were markedly reduced after the start of the treatment. subjects in the pediatric study were 5 children with bacterial infections (4 boys and 1 girl) at  ages from 7 months to 9 years 6 months and with their body weights ranging from 7.6 kg to 51.1 kg. cdzm was intravenously administered at a dose of 9.7 mg/kg to  23.0 mg/kg 4 times a day for 5 to 15 days. although some variations in the fecal  bacterial flora were noticed among these subjects during the treatment, populations of main aerobes and anaerobes such as enterobacteriaceae, enterococcus, bacteroides, bifidobacterium and eubacterium decreased markedly in  most cases. glucose non-fermenting gram-negative rods and fungi tended to increase during or after the administration of cdzm, and they were the most predominant species in some cases. although these changes tended to return to predosing states after the cessation of the treatment with cdzm, attention must be paid to possible occurrences of diarrhea, superinfection or bleeding tendency  when treatment with the drug is continued for long periods of time. fecal concentrations of cdzm considered to be closely related to the changes of the intestinal bacterial flora showed pretty high values in all cases.

AB  == the influence of cefteram pivoxil (cftm-pi), a new oral cephalosporin, on the intestinal bacterial flora was studied in tetra-contaminated mice and in pediatric patients. cftm-pi in fine granular form was administered at a dose of 10 mg/kg once a day for 5 consecutive days to mice contaminated with 4 different  species of organisms: escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, bacteroides fragilis and bifidobacterium breve. no remarkable change was observed in the fecal viable cell count except that slight decrease in e. coli count was observed on days 2 to 5 after starting administration. the subjects in pediatric study were 5 children, 3 boys and 2 girls at ages from 6 months to 10 years 4 months, with infections. their body weights ranged from 3.5 to 28.0 kg. cftm-pi in fine granular form was administered at each dose of 3.0 to 3.8 mg/kg, 3 times daily for 5 to 11 days. during the administration of cftm-pi, there were some variations in the change of the fecal bacterial flora noticed between subjects. although enterobacteriaceae tended to decrease and enterococci tended to increase, other main aerobes and anaerobes were almost unchanged in most cases. there was no case in which glucose non-fermenting gram-negative rods and fungi became predominant. in a 10 years 4 months old boy, the fecal concentration of cftm, the active form of cftm-pi, was 72.20 micrograms/g and a remarkable decrease of total anaerobe count was observed. in feces, cftm-pi and cftm were detected in 4 and 2 cases respectively, and their concentrations were 1.50 approximately 89.65 micrograms/g and 2.25 approximately 72.20 micrograms/g, respectively. beta-lactamase activities in feces were positive in all cases. from the above, cftm-pi is considered to be a drug with relatively less influence on the intestinal bacterial flora. but as high concentrations of drugs were detected in feces under some circumstances, we need to pay attention to fecal drug concentrations.

TI  == [pharmacokinetic and bacteriological studies on sulbactam/ampicillin in the field of pediatrics].
AB  == pharmacokinetic and bacteriological studies were carried out on sulbactam/ampicillin (sbt/abpc) in the field of pediatrics. the results obtained  are summarized as follows: 1. a total of 248 clinical isolates were employed to determine minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) of sbt/abpc against various bacterial species. sbt/abpc showed stronger antibacterial activity against gram-positive organisms than against gram-negative rods. 2. the peak serum level  of abpc was about twice as high as that of sbt, and serum levels of abpc and sbt  declined with time. both drugs showed almost the same trend of changes in concentrations. the half-lives of both drugs were about 1 hour. 3. the urinary recovery rates over 6 hours after administration were 52-80% for abpc and 70-73%  for sbt. 4. the effect of sbt/abpc on coagulation system was examined. no case showed changes in pt, aptt, tt and hpt before and after administration of sbt/abpc. platelet aggregation during administration of sbt/abpc was slightly faster than that before administration, suggesting that sbt/abpc had no effect on platelet aggregation. generally speaking, it seemed that sbt/abpc was a safe antibiotic for bleeding. 5. the effect of sbt/abpc on the intestinal bacterial flora in experimental animals was examined. escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, bacteroides fragilis and bifidobacterium breve were reduced after administration of sbt/abpc, suggesting that the intestinal bacterial flora was affected by the administration of sbt/abpc more greatly than by the administration of abpc alone. in a similar investigation being made with clinical cases, both aerobes and anaerobes showed great changes. concentrations of the drugs in feces increased with increasing dosage, resulting in greater changes of  the intestinal bacterial flora. thus, the total number of aerobes and anaerobes was reduced. no diarrhea was observed in any subjects examined. from the above results, it appeared that sbt/abpc was a safe and useful antibiotic for various bacterial infections in the field of pediatrics.

TI  == [influence of sultamicillin on intestinal bacterial flora].
AB  == effects of sultamicillin (sbtpc) fine granules, a new oral beta-lactam antibiotic, on the intestinal bacterial flora were studied in tetra-contaminated  mice and in pediatric patients. sbtpc was administered at a dose of 100 mg/kg once a day for 5 consecutive days to mice contaminated with 4 different species of organisms: escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, bacteroides fragilis and bifidobacterium breve. in all of the 4 species, bacterial populations in feces were markedly reduced on days 4 to 5 after the start of the treatment. subjects in the pediatric study were 5 children with bacterial infections (4 boys and 1 girl) at ages from 1 year 3 months to 10 years 8 months and with their body weight ranging from 11.8 kg to 35.0 kg. sbtpc fine granule was administered at a  dose of 10 mg/kg 3 to 4 times a day for 4 to 7 days. although there were some variations in the fecal bacterial flora noticed among these subjects during the treatment, populations of main aerobes and anaerobes such as enterobacteriaceae,  enterococcus, bacteroides and bifidobacterium decreased markedly in all cases. these decreases were more pronounced for anaerobes and total numbers of anaerobes were markedly reduced in all cases. glucose non-fermenting gram-negative rods and fungi tended to increase with administration of sbtpc fine granule. although these changes tended to return to pre-dosing state after the cessation of the treatment with sbtpc fine granule, attention must be paid to possible occurrences of diarrhea, superinfection or bleeding tendency when treatment with the drug is  continued for a long period of time. fecal concentrations of both ampicillin and  sulbactam during sbtpc fine granule treatment showed relatively high values except 1 sample with a high beta-lactamase activity in feces. these high concentrations suggest the possibility of biliary excretion of absorbed drugs and the possibility of hydrolysis of sbtpc in the intestine due to high ph. fecal concentrations of the drug also appeared to be closely related to beta-lactamase  activity in feces.

TI  == the intestinal microflora of infants: composition of fecal flora in breast-fed and bottle-fed infants.
AB  == the fecal flora of 35 breast-fed and 35 bottle-fed babies was determined. bifidobacteria were the predominant fecal bacteria in both groups. conversely, the counts of most of the other bacteria, such as bacteroides, eubacteria, peptococci, veillonella, clostridia, enterobacteria, streptococci, and bacilli in the bottle-fed group were significantly higher than those in the breast-fed group. the frequencies of occurrence of lecithinase positive clostridia, clostridia-others, pseudomonas and bacilli in the bottle-fed group were significantly higher than those in the breast-fed group. twenty-one genera and 103 species or biovars of microorganisms were isolated from the feces of the breast-fed group and 20 genera and 97 species or biovars from the bottle-fed group. the organism that showed the highest number and the highest frequency of occurrence in both groups was bifidobacterium breve. bifidobacterium infantis, which was formerly the most prevalent bifidobacterium species in baby feces, was  never isolated in this study. further, the counts and incidences of clostridium paraputrificum, c. perfringens, and bacillus subtilis, the counts of c. clostridiiforme, bacteroides vulgatus, veillonella parvula, lactobacillus acidophilus, escherichia coli, streptococcus bovis, s. faecalis, and s. faecium and the incidences of c. difficile, c. tertium, and pseudomonas aeruginosa in the bottle-fed infants were significantly higher than those in the breast-fed infants.
