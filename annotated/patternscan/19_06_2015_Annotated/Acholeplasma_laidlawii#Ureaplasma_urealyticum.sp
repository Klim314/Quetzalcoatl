TI  == simultaneous detection and identification of common cell culture contaminant and  pathogenic mollicutes strains by reverse line blot hybridization.
AB  == we have developed a reverse line blot (rlb) hybridization assay to detect and identify the commonest mollicutes causing cell line contamination (mycoplasma arginini, mycoplasma fermentans, mycoplasma hyorhinis, mycoplasma orale, and acholeplasma laidlawii) and human infection (mycoplasma pneumoniae, mycoplasma hominis, mycoplasma genitalium, ureaplasma parvum, and ureaplasma urealyticum). we developed a nested pcr assay with "universal" primers targeting the mollicute  16s-23s rrna intergenic spacer region. amplified biotin-labeled pcr products were hybridized to membrane-bound species-specific oligonucleotide probes. the assay correctly identified reference strains of 10 mollicute species. cell cultures submitted for detection of mollicute contamination, clinical specimens, and clinical isolates were initially tested by pcr assay targeting a presumed mollicute-specific sequence of the 16s rrna gene. any that were positive were assessed by the rlb assay, with species-specific pcr assay as the reference method. initially, 100 clinical and 88 of 92 cell culture specimens gave concordant results, including 18 in which two or more mollicute species were detected by both methods. pcr and sequencing of the 16s-23s rrna intergenic spacer region and subsequent retesting by species-specific pcr assay of the four  cell culture specimens for which results were initially discrepant confirmed the  original rlb results. sequencing of amplicons from 12 cell culture specimens that were positive in the 16s rrna pcr assay but negative by both the rlb and species-specific pcr assays failed to identify any mollicute species. the rlb hybridization assay is sensitive and specific and able to rapidly detect and identify mollicute species from clinical and cell line specimens.

TI  == effect of some psychotropic drugs and a barbiturate on mycoplasmas.
AB  == the inhibitory effect of selected membrane stabilisers on mycoplasma pneumoniae,  m. hominis and ureaplasma urealyticum was investigated in vitro. the phenothiazine chlorpromazine (cpz) and the barbiturate thiopental (leopental(r))  as well as the stereo-isomeric thioxanthene derivatives; cis(z)-clopenthixol (zu-clopenthixol(r))/ trans (e)-clopenthixol and cis (z)-chlorprothixen (truxal(r))/trans(e)-chlorprothixen, all have antimycoplasmal effect in the range 3.9-312 mg/l, measured as growth inhibition. it was also demonstrated that the enzymatic functions of the different mycoplasma strains, such as breakdown of glucose, arginine and urea, were abolished by concentrations of cpz that were sufficiently low to allow multiplication of the organisms. a similar effect was obtained with leopental(r) although the mycoplasmas were generally only half as sensitive to this drug. also m. gallisepticum and acholeplasma laidlawii were inhibited by cpz and thiopental. the four thioxanthenes were all inhibitory to mycoplasmal growth and the effect was independent of their stereo-isomeric configuration. the clopenthixol stereoisomers, but not the chlorprothixene isomers, inhibited colour change at concentrations lower than those which inhibited growth. while enzyme activity may continue for some time in vitro when  classic antibiotics have inhibited mycoplasmal growth, the reverse effect was observed with phenothiazines and thioxanthenes. the membrane stabilisers may be useful tools in the investigation of microbiological activity on the mycoplasma membrane. from these drugs, new 'antibiotics' might be developed with another action than that of the known antimycoplasmal drugs.

TI  == evidence that mycoplasmas, gram-negative bacteria, and certain gram-positive bacteria share a similar protein antigen.
AB  == it was demonstrated that mycoplasmas, gram-negative bacteria, and certain gram-positive bacteria share a similar protein antigen with a molecular weight ranging from 42,000 to 48,000. western blotting (immunoblotting) with an antibody specific to a 43-kda membrane protein of mycoplasma fermentans showed the existence of this protein antigen in all mycoplasma spp. tested (14 species), acholeplasma laidlawii (1 strain), and gram-negative bacteria (8 species) but only in staphylococcus aureus of four gram-positive species tested. neither ureaplasma urealyticum nor mammalian cell cultures showed any cross-reactions with this antibody. these proteins were found in both cytoplasmic and membrane fractions of mycoplasma cells but were not exposed on the surface of mycoplasmal  or bacterial cells.

TI  == comparison of glycoproteins from ten human mycoplasma species.
AB  == multiple bands of glycoprotein, rare in procaryotes, were detected in ten human mycoplasma species by staining with periodic acid-schiff (pas) reagent after sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page). a major contaminant formed in hayflick medium (h medium), corresponding to an apparent molecular weight of about 80 kd, was eliminated by using the organisms grown in pplo broth supplemented with pplo serum fraction (p medium), except that m. genitalium and m. pneumoniae were grown in h medium as monolayers on the glass surface. the comparison of glycoproteins among ten human mycoplasma species indicated that their profiles were shown to be species-specific. however, those of m. buccale and m. faucium were very similar, and m. pneumoniae and m. genitalium seemed to be related.

TI  == pulse-field electrophoresis indicates full-length mycoplasma chromosomes range widely in size.
AB  == full-size linear chromosomes were prepared from mycoplasmas by using gamma-irradiation to introduce one (on average) double-strand break in their circular chromosomes. chromosome sizes were estimated by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) from the mobilities of these full-length molecules relative to dna size references. sizes estimated for ureaplasma urealyticum t960  and 16 mycoplasma species ranged from 684 kbp (m. hominis) to 1315 kbp (m. iowae). using this sample, we found no correlation between the mobility of the full-size linear chromosomes and their g + c content. sizes for a. laidlawii and  a. hippikon were within the range expected from renaturation kinetics. pfge size  estimates are in good agreement with sizes determined by other methods, including electron microscopy, an ordered clone library, and summation of restriction fragments. our estimates also agree with those from renaturation kinetics for both the largest and some of the smallest chromosomes, but in the intermediate size range, renaturation kinetics consistently provides lower values than pfge or electron microscopy. our pfge estimates show that mycoplasma chromosomes span a continual range of sizes, with several intermediate values falling between the previously recognized large and small chromosome size clusters.

TI  == human ureaplasmas show diverse genome sizes by pulsed-field electrophoresis.
AB  == contour clamped homogeneous field (chef) agarose gel electrophoresis (age), ramped to give linear separation of dna molecules of 600-1600 kilobase pairs (kbp), was used to determine mobilities for full-sized genomic dna of the serotype standard strains of the human genital mollicutes, ureaplasma urealyticum relative to yeast chromosomal dna markers. indicated genome sizes (in kbp) were 760 for the four biotype 1 strains and 840-1140 for eleven biotype 2 strains. other estimates were: 720 for mycoplasma hominis, 1070 for mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, 890 for mycoplasma flocculare, 1180 and 1350 for mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides y and gc1176-2, respectively, and 1650 and 1580 for acholeplasma laidlawii b and pg 8, respectively. these data supplement previous evidence from chef age that the genomes of the mycoplasmataceae are diverse in size with some larger than previously estimated from dna renaturation kinetics.

TI  == development and application of monoclonal antibodies for the detection of cell infecting mycoplasmas.
AB  == two hybridoma cell lines producing monoclonal antibodies (mabs) to mycoplasmas were established by fusion of mouse myeloma and spleen cells obtained from mice immunized with whole cell mycoplasma pneumoniae antigens. the mabs designated as  myc-4 and myc-9 bound to a single m. pneumoniae protein band with approximate molecular weights of 150,000. in dot-eia both mabs reacted with ten mycoplasma spp., two serovars of ureaplasma urealyticum and acholeplasma laidlawii. the mabs have great potential to be used as an antibody probe for the rapid screening of cell cultures and hybridomas for mycoplasmal contamination.

TI  == virus-like infectious agent (vlia) is a novel pathogenic mycoplasma: mycoplasma incognitus.
AB  == the newly recognized pathogenic virus-like infectious agent (vlia), originally reported in patients with aids but also known to be pathogenic in previously healthy non-aids patients and in non-human primates, was cultured in cell-free conditions using a modified sp-4 medium and classified as a member of the order mycoplasmatales, class mollicutes. the infectious microorganism is tentatively referred to as mycoplasma incognitus. m. incognitus has the unique biochemical properties of utilizing glucose both aerobically and anaerobically, as well as having the ability to metabolize arginine. among all known human mycoplasmas, these specific biochemical characteristics were found previously only in a rarely isolated species, m. fermentans. in comparison with m. fermentans, m. incognitus  appears to be even more fastidious in cultivation requirements and fails to grow  in all tested mycoplasma media other than modified sp-4 medium. in addition, m. incognitus grows much more slowly, has a smaller spherical particle size and occasional filamentous morphology, and forms only irregular and very small colonies with diffuse edges on agar plates. antigenic analysis using polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies and dna analysis of sequence homology and restriction enzyme mappings in m. incognitus, m. orale, m. hyorhinis, m. hominis, m. pneumoniae, m. fermentans, m. arginini, m. genitalium, m. salivarium, ureaplasma  urealyticum, and acholeplasma laidlawii revealed that m. incognitus is distinct from other mycoplasmas, but is most closely related to m. fermentans.

TI  == inactivation of the vascular permeability-increasing activity of bradykinin by mycoplasmas.
AB  == mycoplasma pneumoniae, m. genitalium, m. fermentans, m. hominis, m. salivarium, m. orale, ureaplasma urealyticum and acholeplasma laidlawii inactivated the vascular permeability-increasing activity of bradykinin when the mixture of bradykinin and mycoplasma cells was injected after incubation at 37 degrees c for 1 h. cell components responsible for inactivation of the activity of bradykinin were found to be arginine-specific aminopeptidase and carboxypeptidase.

TI  == mollicutes dna polymerases: characterization of a single enzyme from mycoplasma mycoides and ureaplasma urealyticum and of three enzymes from acholeplasma laidlawii.
AB  == the dna polymerase activity of different members of mollicutes was studied. a single dna polymerase was found in mycoplasma mycoides and ureaplasma urealyticum, type species of the genera mycoplasma and ureaplasma, and was compared with the previously described mycoplasma orale enzyme. most of their properties were comparable; an immunological relationship was demonstrated between m. orale and m. mycoides enzymes by immunoblotting. in contrast to these  results, three different dna polymerases were purified in acholeplasma laidlawii, type species of the genus acholeplasma which, in this aspect, resembles the genus spiroplasma. a 3'-5' exonuclease activity was found in the different purified preparations. in m. mycoides, m. orale and one of the three a. laidlawii preparations, the 3'-5' exonuclease could be separated from the dna polymerase by non-denaturing page. the presence of a single dna polymerase seems to be a typical feature of the mycoplasmataceae, which include the genera mycoplasma and  ureaplasma, in contrast to the occurrence of three enzymes within the acholeplasmataceae and spiroplasmataceae. these results are in agreement with the phylogenetic tree of mollicutes proposed from their 5 s and 16 s rrna sequence comparisons, in which the evolution of acholeplasma and spiroplasma branches led, by genome reductions, to mycoplasma and ureaplasma species.

TI  == anti-mycoplasmal activity of a new macrolide: miocamycin.
AB  == the object of this study was the evaluation of the activity of miocamycin and other macrolides (erythromycin and josamycin) against 61 ureaplasma urealyticum,  1 acholeplasma laidlawii and 21 aerobe mycoplasmas (m. pneumoniae, m. hominis, m. gallisepticum, m. mycoides) and anaerobe mycoplasmas (m. morale and m. salivarium) both clinically isolated and standard reference strains. the minimum  inhibitory concentrations (mic) values for miocamycin ranged between 0.00625 mg/l and 0.4 mg/l (ureaplasmas) and between 0.001 mg/l and 0.0625 mg/l (mycoplasmas, except m. hominis with 0.025 mg/l to 0.25 mg/l). for erythromycin, the mic values ranged between 0.19 mg/l up to 500 mg/l (ureaplasmas) and between 0.001 mg/l to 0.0625 mg/l (mycoplasmas, except m. hominis with 100 mg/l to 1000 mg/l). mic values for josamycin ranged between 0.03125 mg/l and 0.5 mg/l (m. pneumoniae only). the sub-mic treatment (carried out on human pathogenic mycoplasmas only) evidenced growth curve modifications and a decrease of the o2 uptake directly correlated to the drug concentrations.

TI  == ultrastructural changes in mollicutes induced by the peptide antibiotic herbicolin a.
AB  == electron microscopy of negatively stained mycoplasma, ureaplasma, and acholeplasma cells showed ultrastructural changes after 10 min of treatment of the organisms with the peptide antibiotic herbicolin a in concentrations ranging  from 10 micrograms/ml for mycoplasma capricolum to 600 micrograms/ml for ureaplasma urealyticum. the morphological changes were shown to be reversible at  low concentrations of the antibiotic but irreversible at high concentrations.

TI  == construction of the mycoplasma evolutionary tree from 5s rrna sequence data.
AB  == the 5s rrna sequences of eubacteria and mycoplasmas have been analyzed and a phylogenetic tree constructed. we determined the sequences of 5s rrna from clostridium innocuum, acholeplasma laidlawii, acholeplasma modicum, anaeroplasma  bactoclasticum, anaeroplasma abactoclasticum, ureaplasma urealyticum, mycoplasma  mycoides mycoides, mycoplasma pneumoniae, and mycoplasma gallisepticum. analysis  of these and published sequences shows that mycoplasmas form a coherent phylogenetic group that, with c. innocuum, arose as a branch of the low g+c gram-positive tree, near the lactobacilli and streptococci. the initial event in  mycoplasma phylogeny was formation of the acholeplasma branch; hence, loss of cell wall probably occurred at the time of genome reduction to approximately to 1000 mda. a subsequent branch produced the spiroplasma. this branch appears to have been the origin of sterol-requiring mycoplasmas. during development of the spiroplasma branch there were several independent genome reductions, each to approximately 500 mda, resulting in mycoplasma and ureaplasma species. mycoplasmas, particularly species with the smallest genomes, have high mutation rates, suggesting that they are in a state of rapid evolution.

TI  == effects of manganese on the growth and morphology of ureaplasma urealyticum.
AB  == all of the 14 serotype standard strains of ureaplasma urealyticum were inhibited  to varying degrees by manganese. a 1 mm concentration of this cation either stopped growth or reduced the rate of growth in liquid medium. the presence of manganese also altered colonial morphology and cellular ultrastructure. inhibition was dose dependent and strain specific. this differential response allowed the serotype strains to be divided into two broad biotypes. for the first biotype (serotypes 1, 3, 6, and 14), inhibition of growth in broth was temporary. for the second biotype (serotypes 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12), inhibition was permanent. serotype 13 gave an intermediate response and was not classified.  the effect of manganese could be at least partially blocked by magnesium but not  by calcium, cobalt, copper, iron, potassium, sodium, or zinc. the concentration of magnesium yielding the maximum blocking effect was directly related to manganese sensitivity. wild-type isolates of ureaplasma and mycoplasma hominis also showed a differential response to manganese. laboratory-adapted strains representing species of the genus mycoplasma (m. hominis, m. fermentans, and m. pneumoniae) were inhibited by 5 but not by 1 mm manganese. the latter concentration inhibited the growth of acholeplasma laidlawii and staphylococcus aureus, and 5 mm manganese had no effect on escherichia coli.

TI  == immunoglobulin a protease activity of ureaplasma urealyticum.
AB  == all of 14 serotype standards and 34 of 35 wild-type strains of ureaplasma urealyticum isolated from humans demonstrated an immunoglobulin a (iga) protease  activity. this activity degraded radiolabeled human iga including iga1 but not igg or azocasein. the iga fragments were detected by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by radioautography, and they had molecular weights of about 110,000 and 50,000. the iga protease activity persisted in 25 mm edta but was sensitive to trypsin; it was presumed to be protein. this is the fourth microbial genus and the first myocoplasma species in  which an iga protease activity has been identified. such activity was absent in mycoplasma pneumoniae, mycoplasma hominis, and acholeplasma laidlawii.

TI  == colony morphology, ultrastructure and morphogenesis in mycoplasma hominis, acholeplasma laidlawii and ureaplasma urealyticum.
AB  == colonies of mycoplasma hominis, acholeplasma laidlawii (three strains) and ureaplasma urealyticum were examined by light and electron microscopy and their characteristic morphology, ultrastructure and morphogenesis are described. mycoplasma hominis and a. laidlawii, pg8 and oral strains, developed typical 'fried-egg' colonies which were remarkably heterogeneous in size. the colonies of a. laidlawii strain nctc 10116 were more homogeneous and grew mainly on the surface of the agar showing a fine granular appearance. ureaplasma urealyticum produced smaller, granular colonies which grew deeply embedded in the agar and generally without much surface growth. the cellular ultrastructure in these colonies was also examined. the results indicate that several aspects of colony morphogenesis and ultrastructure varied for each of the three species examined.

TI  == effect of ammonium ion concentration and osmotic pressure on growth of ureaplasma urealyticum (t-strain mycoplasma).
AB  == the effect of ammonium ion concentration and osmotic pressure on growth of ureaplasma urealyticum type viii was determined by using a well-buffered broth medium containing 10 mm urea. the addition of nh4cl to the medium at concentrations up to 10 mm did not affect growth; however, addition of larger quantities progressively decreased both the specific growth rate (mu) and the maximum yield of the culture, with concentrations of 80 mm completely inhibiting  growth. addition of either 150 mm kcl or nacl to the medium did not inhibit growth, indicating that the growth-inhibitory effect was specific to nh4+ and was neither a result of increased cl- concentration nor increased osmotic pressure. concentrations of nh4cl as high as 100 mm did not affect growth of either acholeplasma laidlawii or mycoplasma hominis. u. urealyticum was more sensitive to osmotic pressure: osmotic pressures of 710 to 780 mosmol/kg (with kcl, nacl, or sucrose) resulted in both a substantially lower growth rate and a 5- to 10-fold lower peak yield of organisms. both a laidlawii and m. hominis were less  sensitive to increased osmotic pressure.

TI  == localization of enzymes in ureaplasma urealyticum (t-strain mycoplasma).
AB  == ureaplasma urealyticum cells were lysed by osmotic shock or by digitonin. the membrane fraction contained four to ten times as much protein as the cytoplasmic  fraction. these values are in large excess of those reported for classical mycoplasmas, suggesting that the ureaplasma membrane fraction was heavily contaminated with proteins derived from the growth medium. the u. urealyticum urease activity was localized in the cytoplasmic fraction, whereas the adenosine  triphosphatase activity was localized in the membrane fraction. significant urease activity could be detected also in nonviable cells. urea, at concentrations above 0.25 m, was mycoplasmastatic to acholeplasma laidlawii, mycoplasma hominis, and u. urealyticum, so that the ureaplasma urease did not afford preferential protection against urea toxicity. the intracellular localization of the urease would be expected to release ammonia from urea in the  cytoplasm. the ammonia will take up protons to become ammonium ions. it can be hypothesized that the intracellular nh4+ plays a role in proton elimination or acid-base balance, which might be coupled to an energy producing ion gradient and/or transport mechanisms.

TI  == isoelectric focusing of mycoplasma proteins.
AB  == polyacrylamide gel isoelectric focusing (pagif) in thin layer was used to resolve proteins of mycoplasma spp., acholeplasma spp., and eight strains of ureaplasma urealyticum (t-strain). a mixture of urea, triton x-100, and dithioerythritol was used to solubilize sonically disrupted cells. pagif was performed in the range of ph 3 to 10. protein patterns were carefully compared, demonstrating resolved and  distinguishable species-specific protein bands. the eight serotypes of u. urealyticum (t-strain) gave identical protein patterns in the ph 3 to 10 range. the characteristic "fingerprints" of a species appeared to correlate with the biochemical nature and not the habitat in each case. arginine-hydrolyzing species seemed to show more diverse focusing than those that ferment glucose, or prefer an acid environment. characterization and identification of highly resolved species-specific proteins, ease of performance, and reproducibility of this method suggest that pagif might be employed as a taxonomic aid.
