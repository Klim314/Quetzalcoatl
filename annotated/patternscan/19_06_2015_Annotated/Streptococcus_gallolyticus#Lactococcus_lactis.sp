TI  == comparative genomics of the dairy isolate streptococcus macedonicus aca-dc 198 against related members of the streptococcus bovis/streptococcus equinus complex.
AB  == background: within the genus streptococcus, only streptococcus thermophilus is used as a starter culture in food fermentations. streptococcus macedonicus though, which belongs to the streptococcus bovis/streptococcus equinus complex (sbsec), is also frequently isolated from fermented foods mainly of dairy origin. members of the sbsec have been implicated in human endocarditis and colon cancer. here we compare the genome sequence of the dairy isolate s. macedonicus aca-dc 198 to the other sbsec genomes in order to assess in silico its potential adaptation to milk and its pathogenicity status. results: despite the fact that the sbsec species were found tightly related based on whole genome phylogeny of streptococci, two distinct patterns of evolution were identified among them. streptococcus macedonicus, streptococcus infantarius cj18 and streptococcus pasteurianus atcc 43144 seem to have undergone reductive evolution resulting in significantly diminished genome sizes and increased percentages of potential pseudogenes when compared to streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus. in addition, the three species seem to have lost genes for catabolizing complex plant carbohydrates and for detoxifying toxic substances previously linked to the ability of s. gallolyticus to survive in the rumen. analysis of the s. macedonicus genome revealed features that could support adaptation to milk, including an extra gene cluster for lactose and galactose metabolism, a proteolytic system for casein hydrolysis, auxotrophy for several vitamins, an increased ability to resist bacteriophages and horizontal gene transfer events with the dairy lactococcus lactis and s. thermophilus as potential donors. in addition, s. macedonicus lacks several pathogenicity-related genes found in s. gallolyticus. for example, s. macedonicus has retained only one (i.e. the pil3) of the three pilus gene clusters which may mediate the binding of s. gallolyticus to the extracellular matrix. unexpectedly, similar findings were obtained not only for the dairy s. infantarius cj18, but also for the blood isolate s. pasteurianus atcc 43144. conclusions: our whole genome analyses suggest traits of adaptation of s. macedonicus to the nutrient-rich dairy environment. during this  process the bacterium gained genes presumably important for this new ecological niche. finally, s. macedonicus carries a reduced number of putative sbsec virulence factors, which suggests a diminished pathogenic potential.

TI  == the dominant microbial community associated with fermentation of obushera (sorghum and millet beverages) determined by culture-dependent and culture-independent methods.
AB  == obushera includes four fermented cereal beverages from uganda namely: obutoko, enturire, ekitiribita and obuteire, whose microbial diversity has not hitherto been fully investigated. knowledge of the microbial diversity and dynamics in these products is crucial for understanding their safety and development of appropriate starter cultures for controlled industrial processing. culture-dependent and culture-independent techniques including denaturating gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) and mixed dna sequencing of polymerase chain  reaction (pcr) amplified ribosomal rna genes were used to study the bacteria and  yeast diversity of obushera. the ph dropped from 6.0-4.6 to 3.5-4.0 within 1-2 days for obutoko, enturire and obuteire whereas that of ekitiribita decreased to  4.4 after 4 days. counts of lactic acid bacteria (lab) increased from 5.0 to 11.0 log cfug(-1) and yeasts increased from 3.4 to 7.1 log cfug(-1) while coliform counts decreased from 2.0 to <1 log cfug(-1) during four days of fermentation. lab and yeast isolates were identified by rrna gene sequence analysis. lab isolates included: enterococcus spp., lactobacillus (lb.) plantarum, lb. fermentum, lb. delbrueckii, lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc lactis, streptococcus (s.) infantarius subsp. infantarius, pediococcus pentosaceus and weisella (w.) confusa. dgge indicated predominance of s. gallolyticus, s. infantarius subsp. infantarius, lb. fermentum, lb. delbrueckii, w. confusa, lb. reuteri, fructobacillus spp., l. lactis and l. lactis. yeast isolates included clavispora  lusitaniae, cyberlindnera fabianii, issatchenkia orientalis and saccharomyces cerevisiae. dgge indicated predominance of s. cerevisiae in obutoko, enturire and obuteire and also detected pichia spp. and i. orientalis in obutoko. obushera produced in the laboratory was initially dominated by enterobacteriaceae and later by lactococcus spp. enterobacteriaceae and bacillus spp. were also detected in ekitiribita. development of starters for obushera may require combinations of  lab and s. cerevisiae for obutoko, enturire and obuteire and lab for ekitiribita.

TI  == molecular characterization of a streptococcus gallolyticus genomic island encoding a pilus involved in endocarditis.
AB  == background: streptococcus gallolyticus is a causative agent of infective endocarditis associated with colon cancer. genome sequence of strain ucn34 revealed the existence of 3 pilus loci (pil1, pil2, and pil3). pili are long filamentous structures playing a key role as adhesive organelles in many pathogens. the pil1 locus encodes 2 lpxtg proteins (gallo2178 and gallo2179) and  1 sortase c (gallo2177). gallo2179 displaying a functional collagen-binding domain was referred to as the adhesin, whereas gallo2178 was designated as the major pilin. methods: s. gallolyticus ucn34, pil1(+) and pil1(-), expressing various levels of pil1, and recombinant lactococcus lactis strains, constitutively expressing pil1, were studied. polyclonal antibodies raised against the putative pilin subunits gallo2178 and gallo2179 were used in immunoblotting and immunogold electron microscopy. the role of pil1 was tested in a rat model of endocarditis. results: we showed that the pil1 locus (gallo2179-78-77) forms an operon differentially expressed among s. gallolyticus  strains. short pilus appendages were identified both on the surface of s. gallolyticus ucn34 and recombinant l. lactis-expressing pil1. we demonstrated that pil1 pilus is involved in binding to collagen, biofilm formation, and virulence in experimental endocarditis. conclusions: this study identifies pil1 as the first virulence factor characterized in s. gallolyticus.

TI  == reidentification of streptococcus bovis isolates causing bacteremia according to  the new taxonomy criteria: still an issue?
AB  == all streptococcus bovis blood culture isolates recovered from january 2003 to january 2010 (n = 52) at the hospital universitario ramon y cajal were reidentified on the basis of their genetic traits using new taxonomic criteria. initial identification was performed by the semiautomatic wider system (fco. soria-melguizo, spain) and the api 20 strep system (biomerieux, france). all isolates were reidentified by pcr amplification and sequencing of both the 16s rrna and soda genes and by mass spectrometry using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms; bruker, germany). results of 16s rrna/soda gene sequencing were as follows: streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus, 14/14 (number of isolates identified by 16s rrna/number of isolates identified by soda gene sequencing); streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus, 24/24; streptococcus spp., 7/0; streptococcus infantarius subsp. infantarius, 0/2; streptococcus lutetiensis, 0/5; leuconostoc  mesenteroides, 4/0; and lactococcus lactis, 3/3. maldi-tof ms identified 27 s. gallolyticus isolates but not at the subspecies level, 4 l. mesenteroides isolates, 3 l. lactis isolates, and 6 s. lutetiensis isolates, whereas 12 isolates rendered a nonreliable identification result. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis grouped all s. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus isolates into 3 major clusters clearly different from those of the s. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus isolates, which, in turn, exhibited no clonal relationship. the percentages of resistance to the tested antimicrobials were 38% for erythromycin, 23% for fosfomycin, 10% for levofloxacin, 6% for tetracycline, and 4% for co-trimoxazole. the most frequent underlying diseases were hepatobiliary disorders (53%), endocarditis (17%), and malignancies (12%). we conclude that sequencing of the soda gene was the most discriminatory method and that s. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus appears to have a higher genetic diversity than  s. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus.

TI  == analysis of bacterial communities of traditional fermented west african cereal foods using culture independent methods.
AB  == in this study, the microbial composition of kunu-zaki and ogi, two popular foods  in nigeria produced after natural, uncontrolled fermentation of cereals, was assessed by culture-independent molecular profiling methods. in particular, pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and construction of 16s rrna gene clone libraries revealed the presence of diverse bacterial communities. dna sequencing of the highly variable v3 region of the 16s rrna genes obtained from pcr-dgge fingerprints identified species related to weissella confusa, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus amylolyticus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, bacillus spp. and lactococcus lactis spp lactis from food samples obtained from northern and southern geographical locations. a more comprehensive analysis of 272 full-length 16s rrna gene inserts revealed that 70% of them were assigned to the lactobacillaceae family and 19% to the streptococcaceae family. interestingly, sequences associated with a particular food type were also identified. for example, l. plantarum, l. pantheris and l. vaccinostercus were found in ogi but not in kunu-zaki while w. confusa, streptococcus lutetiensis and streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus were  found in kunu-zaki but not in ogi. phylotypes corresponding to potentially pathogenic bacteria, such as clostridium perfringens and bacillus cereus were also detected highlighting the need for controlled fermentation processes.
