TI  - Antibacterial activity of selected medicinal plants against multiple antibiotic resistant uropathogens: a study from Kolli Hills, Tamil Nadu, India.
AB  - The increasing incidence of antibiotic resistance among bacterial pathogens necessitates medicinal plants as an alternate therapy in restricting the resistant infectious organisms. In this primitive study, the antibiotic resistance of organisms isolated from urinary tract infected patients was evaluated using the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) method and Multiple Antibiotic Resistance (MAR) index values, and the MAR values was also calculated for plant extracts. The 10 common medicinal plants collected from Kolli hills, Namakkal, south India were extracted using the chloroform, methanol, acetone, ethanol and saponification procedure. The efficacy of the extracts on the uropathogens was tested by agar disc diffusion method in order to analyse the inhibitory activity of plant extract on the organisms. Azadiracta indica A. Juss., Tinospora cordifolia (Wild.) and Euphorbia hirta Linn. exhibited high inhibitory activity against most of the 11 tested organisms followed by Cassia javanica Linn. and Phyllanthus niruri Linn. The maximum zone size of 46.3 mm was exhibited by methanol extract of P. niruri Linn. against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Asparagus racemosus Willd. and Eupatorium triplinerve Vahl had the least activity against resistant pathogens. Saponified lipids of most of the plants exhibited maximum antibacterial activity. Among the tested organisms, P. aeruginosa and Staphylococcus epidermidis were the most susceptible and Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloaceae, Citrobacter koseri, and Citrobacter freundii were the least inhibited by most of the extracts of medicinal plants. It is concluded that revised antibiotic policies and more importantly the development of herbal medicine as an alternative may be incorporated in urological practice.
TI  - [Clinical results of resection arthroplasty for infected shoulder arthroplasty].
AB  - PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: Infection is a rare complication of shoulder arthroplasty.  Various therapeutic solutions have been proposed: antibiotics alone, one-stage or two-stage reimplantation, surgical or arthroscopic cleaning without prosthesis removal, scapulohumeral arthrodesis or simple arthroscopic resection. We evaluated the mid-term clinical outcome after resection arthroplasty for the treatment of infected shoulder arthroplasty. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The series included ten infected arthroplasties in ten patients. Mean duration of implantation was two years seven months (range nine months to five years). Bacteriological diagnosis was established from intraoperative articular samples or systematic samples taken during surgical revision procedures: meti-S Staphylococcus aureus strains (n=4), coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (n=5 including three S. epidermidis) Streptococcus mitis (n=1) and Citrobacter koseri (n=1). The mean Constant score before revision was 58 (range 23-77). Subjective patient satisfaction before surgical revision was rated good in six cases, fair in one and poor in three. Surgery associated removal of the implant, complete resection of the cement, resection of the fistular tracts, wide debridement of infected tissues and total synovectomy. RESULTS: Patients were seen at an average follow-up of three years eight months. The objective functional outcome measured with the Constant score was only fair, 28 points (range 20.6-36), and corresponded to a loss of 29 points compared with the preoperative score. This was explained mainly by lower scores for joint motion, function and muscle force but with persistently satisfactory scores for pain. All patients remained pain-free (daytime and nighttime). Patient satisfaction was rated good for two, fair for five and mediocre for three. Clinical and biological proof of eradicated infection was obtained in all patients. DISCUSSION: Infection remains a serious devastating problem for shoulder arthroplasty with an important functional impact. Resection only has a modest clinical effect. Precise identification of the causal germ with institution of adapted antibiotic therapy is required for eradication of the infection. Early diagnosis is probably the most important parameter affecting clinical outcome and surgical options. Functional results after resection arthroplasty are modest. This procedure should be reserved for patients with reduced functional demands. Improved management of the infectious load and reduction of diagnostic delay should help improve functional outcome and favor use of stow-stage procedures for reinsertion.
TI  - FT-IR microspectroscopy for early identification of some clinically relevant pathogens.
AB  - AIMS: To investigate the potentials and limitations of Fourier transform-infrared (FT-IR) microspectroscopy as a tool to identify, at the level of microcolonies, pathogenic bacteria frequently isolated in the clinical environment. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 1570 FT-IR spectra from 164 gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria isolated from patients were recorded from 6 to 10-h old microcolonies of 50-150 microm size. A classification of 100% was obtained for the most frequent gram-positive bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, and Enterococcus faecium at the species level. An average accuracy of about 80% was reached with Gram negative bacteria from the Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonaceae families; Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella spp., and Citrobacter koseri; and Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli. Results were comparable with FT-IR measurements on dried suspensions from 18-h cultures. CONCLUSIONS: Early identification of young microcolonies is feasible with FT-IR microscopy with a very high accuracy for gram-positive bacteria. Some improvement in the transfer of microcolonies is necessary to increase the accuracy for gram-negative bacteria. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Combination of FT-IR microscopy and multivariate data analysis could be a complementary, rapid, and reliable tool for screening and discriminating, at species and subspecies level, micro-organisms of clinical, food-borne, or environmental origins.
