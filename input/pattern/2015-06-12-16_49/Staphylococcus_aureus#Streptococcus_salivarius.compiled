TI  - Infectious Keratitis Following Corneal Crosslinking: A Systematic Review of Reported Cases: Management, Visual Outcome, and Treatment Proposed.
AB  - Abstract Aim: To describe the infectious complications and the group of pathogens involved in the infection following corneal crosslinking, the visual outcome, and the treatment proposed. Methods: A Medline (National Library of Medicine, Bethesda, MD, USA) search from October 2000 to October 2013 was performed to identify all articles describing infectious keratitis following corneal crosslinking treatment. Nineteen articles were selected. Ten articles reported infectious complications of corneal crosslinking treatment were included. Nine articles were excluded, because seven described sterile keratitis, one article was in German, and one reported general complication without describing the infection complication. Results: A total number of infections reported included 10 eyes. The infectious keratitis was associated with bacteria in five eyes (50%): gram-positive bacteria in three eyes (30%) (staphylococcus epidermidis, S. aureus and streptococcus salivarius plus S. oralis, respectively) and gram-negative bacteria in two eyes (20%) (E. coli; P. aeruginosa); there was herpes virus in two eyes, fungus in two eyes (Fusarium and Microsporidia) (20%), and Acanthamoeba in one eye (10%). Conclusions: Only 10 cases of infectious keratitis following corneal crosslinking are published. The most virulent pathogens were Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acanthamoeba. Less virulent organisms were Escherichia coli and S. epidermidis. Two cases of herpes keratitis were described, suggesting the possibility of systemic antiviral prophylaxis before corneal crosslinking treatment. The most common risk factor of infections identified was postoperative incorrect patient behavior.
TI  - Treatment of atopic dermatitis eczema with a high concentration of Lactobacillus  salivarius LS01 associated with an innovative gelling complex: a pilot study on adults.
AB  - GOALS: To evaluate the efficacy of a highly concentrated Lactobacillus salivarius preparation containing a gelling complex formed by Streptococcus thermophilus ST10 and tara gum in the treatment of atopic dermatitis (AD). BACKGROUND: Previous studies have demonstrated an improvement in AD symptoms after administration of the probiotic strain L. salivarius LS01. S. thermophilus ST10 and tara gum create a gelling complex that adheres to intestinal mucus and improves barrier function. STUDY: A prospective, controlled pilot trial was carried out to evaluate how the association of S. thermophilus ST10 and tara gum could improve the activity of L. salivarius LS01 administered at high doses to adults with AD. Twenty-five patients were included into the study: 13 were treated for 1 month with the active formulation, whereas 12 represented the placebo group. Scoring Atopic Dermatitis index was determined before and at the end of probiotic administration. Fecal samples were also collected to evaluate changes in bacterial counts of Staphylococcus aureus and clostridia. RESULTS: A significant improvement in SCORAD index was observed in the probiotic group after 1 month of treatment, whereas no significant changes occurred in placebo patients. A slight decrease in fecal S. aureus count was observed in probiotic-treated patients. CONCLUSIONS: Data obtained in this study suggest a potential role for L. salivarius LS01 in the treatment of AD. The addition of tara gum and S. thermophilus ST10 seems to improve the overall efficacy of the probiotic strain, in particular shortening the time required for the onset of the positive effects. Further studies to investigate the activity of this preparation are advisable.
TI  - Nanoscopic vibrations of bacteria with different cell-wall properties adhering to surfaces under flow and static conditions.
AB  - Bacteria adhering to surfaces demonstrate random, nanoscopic vibrations around their equilibrium positions. This paper compares vibrational amplitudes of bacteria adhering to glass. Spring constants of the bond are derived from vibrational amplitudes and related to the electrophoretic softness of the cell surfaces and dissipation shifts measured upon bacterial adhesion in a quartz-crystal-microbalance (QCM-D). Experiments were conducted with six bacterial strains with pairwise differences in cell surface characteristics. Vibrational amplitudes were highest in low ionic strength suspensions. Under fluid flow, vibrational amplitudes were lower in the direction of flow than perpendicular to it because stretching of cell surface polymers in the direction of flow causes stiffening of the polyelectrolyte network surrounding a bacterium. Under static conditions (0.57 mM), vibrational amplitudes of fibrillated Streptococcus salivarius HB7 (145 nm) were higher than that of a bald mutant HB-C12 (76 nm). Amplitudes of moderately extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) producing Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC35983 (47 nm) were more than twice the amplitudes of strongly EPS producing S. epidermidis ATCC35984 (21 nm). No differences were found between Staphylococcus aureus strains differing in membrane cross-linking. High vibrational amplitudes corresponded with low dissipation shifts in QCM-D. In streptococci, the polyelectrolyte network surrounding a bacterium is formed by fibrillar surface appendages and spring constants derived from vibrational amplitudes decreased with increasing fibrillar density. In staphylococci, EPS constitutes the main network component, and larger amounts of EPS yielded higher spring constants. Spring constants increased with increasing ionic strength and strains with smaller electrophoretically derived bacterial cell surface softnesses possessed the highest spring constants.
TI  - Using color histograms and SPA-LDA to classify bacteria.
AB  - In this work, a new approach is proposed to verify the differentiating characteristics of five bacteria (Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus oralis, and Staphylococcus aureus) by using digital images obtained with a simple webcam and variable selection by the Successive Projections Algorithm associated with Linear Discriminant Analysis (SPA-LDA). In this sense, color histograms in the red-green-blue (RGB), hue-saturation-value (HSV), and grayscale channels and their combinations were used as input data, and statistically evaluated by using different multivariate classifiers (Soft Independent Modeling by Class Analogy (SIMCA), Principal Component Analysis-Linear Discriminant Analysis (PCA-LDA), Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) and Successive Projections Algorithm-Linear Discriminant Analysis (SPA-LDA)). The bacteria strains were cultivated in a nutritive blood agar base layer for 24 h by following the Brazilian Pharmacopoeia, maintaining the status of cell growth and the nature of nutrient solutions under the same conditions. The best result in classification was obtained by using RGB and SPA-LDA, which reached 94 and 100 % of classification accuracy in the training and test sets, respectively. This result is extremely positive from the viewpoint of routine clinical analyses, because it avoids bacterial identification based on phenotypic identification of the causative organism using Gram staining, culture, and biochemical proofs. Therefore, the proposed method presents inherent advantages, promoting a simpler, faster, and low-cost alternative for bacterial identification.
TI  - Open-label study to evaluate the pharmacodynamics, clinical efficacy, and safety  of meropenem for adult bacterial meningitis in Japan.
AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy, safety, and concentration of meropenem in cerebrospinal fluid when meropenem (2 g every 8 h) was administered to Japanese adult patients with bacterial meningitis. Five Japanese patients (mean age 60.6 years [range 35-71]) were enrolled. Infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae (three patients), Streptococcus salivarius (one patient), and Staphylococcus aureus (one patient) was confirmed by cerebrospinal fluid culture. Meropenem (2 g every 8 h) was administered to all five patients. Treatment duration ranged from 14 to 28 days (mean 22.6 days). All the patients were successfully treated. The concentration of meropenem in cerebrospinal fluid ranged from 0.27 to 6.40 mug/ml up to 8.47 h and was over 1 mug/ml 3 h after starting meropenem infusion. In each patient, the present study confirmed for the first time that the concentration of meropenem in cerebrospinal fluid exceeded the minimal inhibitory concentration for these pathogens. Eleven clinical and laboratory adverse events considered to be related to meropenem were observed in all patients, but no serious adverse event and no discontinuance of treatment due to adverse events occurred. Thus meropenem appeared to be a well-tolerated and effective agent for Japanese adult patients with bacterial meningitis. 2 g every 8 h of meropenem was delivered to CSF and its concentration was exceed in MICs for the detected pathogens.
TI  - Molecular detection of bacteria associated to dental caries in 4-12-year-old Tunisian children.
AB  - The occurrence of several microbial species in the oral cavity of 4-12-year-old Tunisian children was investigated. Samples were taken from 158 children (81 caries actives and 77 caries free). Genomic DNA was extracted and analyzed for the presence of 17 microbial species using a polymerase chain reaction assay. All samples were positive for at least one of the target microbial strains. Streptococcus mutans was the most prevalent species (76.5%) detected in genomic DNA collected from carious lesions. Other prevalent species were Candida spp (63%), Streptococcus salivarius (59%) and Streptococcus oralis (42%). The frequency of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Lactobacillus casei-group in caries lesions was 29.5%, 34.5% and 22% respectively. Pathogenic bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus was found in 28.5% of carious lesion samples compared to 15.5% in the control. Frequency of Porphyromonas endodontali, Actinomyces radicidentis and Treponema denticola recovery did not differ significantly between origins of samples. PCR analysis of genomic DNA detect various oral bacteria that differ between caries actives and caries-free children. In addition, the association of same aciduric bacteria (S. mutans, S. salivarius, L. acidophilus) and caries formation was noticed.
TI  - Poultry farm hygiene: microbiological quality assessment of drinking water used in layer chickens managed under the battery cage and deep litter systems at three poultry farms in southwestern Nigeria.
AB  - Water troughs from deep litter and caged chicken water troughs (drinkers) fixed to each of the different 3-tier cages containing layer chickens in Farms A, B and C were subjected to a 7-day study which involved the monitoring of poultry farm hygiene. Drinkers were washed before filling with water on Day 1. For Days 3, 5 and 7 water was served without prior washing. The occurrence and characterization of the bacteria isolates were investigated and data obtained were analyzed and compared. For the bacterial count on Day 1, for layer chickens on cage system, no significant differences (p > 0.05) among the farms and between the farms tier interactions. On Day 3, no significant difference (p > 0.05) among the parameters. On Day 5, there was significant difference (p<0.05) among the farms and on Day 7, there was high significant difference (p < 0.01) among the farms. On Days 5 and 7, there were no significant differences (p>0.05) among the tiers nor between the interactions of the farms and tiers. The bacterial count in water troughs of layer chickens in deep litter system, on Day 1, had no significant differences (p > 0.05) between the farms, water troughs and their interactions. On Day 3, no significant difference (p > 0.05) among the parameters. On Days 5 and 7, there were significant difference (p<0.05) and a high significant difference (p < 0.01) between the farms respectively. On Days 5 and 7, no significant differences between the water troughs and between the interaction of the farms and the water troughs. Farm A isolates contained Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus vulgaris, Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermis, Klebsiella sp., Salmonella sp., Bacillus subtilis, Lactobacillus salivarius and Corynebacterium sp. Farm B had Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermis, Bacillus subtilis, Corynebacterium sp., Escherichia coli, Streptococcus faecalis and Klebsiella sp. while for Farm C, apart from the prevalent bacteria isolates obtained in Farms A and B, additional 2 bacterial isolates, Lactobacillus salivarius and Pseudomonas aeuriginosa were found. In conclusion, water troughs when cleaned on daily basis carry minimum bacterial load. Those left for 3, 5 and 7 days uncleaned had progressively high bacterial loads, suggesting that the flock of birds and the consumers of the eggs and meat from the chickens are at risk of bacterial infection unless strict farm hygiene is ensured through regular monitoring.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo effects of beneficial vaginal lactobacilli on pathogens responsible for urogenital tract infections.
AB  - The aim of this work was to evaluate the effects of beneficial human vaginal lactobacilli (Lb) on urogenital pathogens through in vitro and in vivo experiments. Co-aggregative and antimicrobial properties between five vaginal Lb strains and urogenital pathogens or potential pathogens (Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans strains) were assayed. Also, associative cultures of Lb strains and S. agalactiae were performed and bacterial growth, pH, lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) were determined at different times. Based on the results obtained, the in vivo studies were assayed in mice with Lactobacillus gasseri CRL 1509 or Lactobacillus salivarius CRL 1328 inoculated intravaginally (i.v.) and then challenged i.v. with S. agalactiae. Results were analysed by ANOVA (repeated measures and general linear models). Most of the Lb strains increased the percentage of aggregation of S. agalactiae strains. Only one strain (Lactobacillus reuteri CRL 1324) positively affected the aggregation of S. aureus and none increased the aggregation of C. albicans. The inhibition of the growth of S. agalactiae strains by production of organic acids by lactobacilli was evidenced. The Lb-S. agalactiae co-cultures showed a significant inhibition of the pathogen after 4 h and 8 h of incubation. Parallel increases in lactic acid and H2O2 levels were observed. However, in the experimental murine model, no significant differences were obtained in the number of streptococci recovered from the vaginal tract of control mice and those inoculated with Lb. In conclusion, vaginal Lb exhibited in vitro co-aggregative and antimicrobial effects on S. agalactiae strains, suggesting that they could be promising candidates for protection against S. agalactiae challenge. However, as these effects were not evidenced in the murine model used, further animal studies under different experimental conditions should be conducted to evaluate the preventive effect of Lb against challenge with S. agalactiae.
TI  - Radiography-based score indicative for the pathogenicity of bacteria in odontogenic infections.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop a new radiography-based score to assess the potential of bacteria to cause odontogenic infections derived from the occurrence of bacteria at small or large radiographical lesions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The patients analyzed were a sub-population from a large randomized clinical trial comparing moxifloxacin and clindamycin in the treatment of inflammatory infiltrates and odontogenic abscesses. Routine radiographs were used to analyze the area of the periapical radiolucent lesions. Lesions were stratified by their radiographically measured area as large (>9 mm(2)) or small (</=9 mm(2)). A risk ratio was calculated for each species from the frequency of their occurrence in large vs in small lesions. RESULTS: Fifty-one patients, 19 with abscesses and 32 with infiltrates, were evaluated. Overall, the radiographical lesion areas ranged from 0.4-46.2 mm(2) (median = 9 mm(2)). An increased risk (risk ratio >1) to occur at large abscess lesions was observed for Prevotella (P.) oralis, P. buccae, P. oris, P. intermedia, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Streptococcus (Strep.) anginosus group. An increased risk to occur at large infiltrate lesions was found for Strep. salivarius, Strep. parasanguis, Strep. anginosus group, Capnocytophaga spp., Neisseria (N.) sicca, Neisseria spp., Staphylococcus (Staph.) aureus, P. intermedia, P. buccae, Prevotella spp. and P. melaninogenica. CONCLUSIONS: The radiography-based score suggests that certain Prevotella spp., F. nucleatum and Strep. anginosus groups play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of odontogenic abscesses, and that various streptococci, Neisseria spp., Capnocytophaga spp., Staph. aureus and Prevotella spp. are involved in the pathogenesis of odontogenic infiltrates.
TI  - [Evaluation of biocidal properties of silver nanoparticles against cariogenic bacteria].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Antimicrobial properties of silver nanoparticles (SNP's) have been  recentl well evaluated, and now are being considered as excellent candidates for therapeutic purposes. It is confirmed, that various solutions of colloidal SNP's possess significant antibacterial properties against such species as: Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa even at low concentrations, although there have been so far only a few researches evaluating antimicrobial activity of SNP's against cariogenic bacteria: Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius and Streptococcus mitis responsible for initiation of dental carries. Tooth decay is infectious disease an worldwide, which may occur in patients of every age. Nanotechnology creates a new approach of designing of medical devices preventing or reducing bacterial colonization. METHODS: Colloidal silver solution (CSS) of concentration 350 ppm was used in this research. Nanoparticles size, shape and solution stability were evaluated. 16 strains of cariogenic bacteria, 4 isolates of each species: S. mutans, S. salivarius, S. sanguinis and S, mitis were obtained from plaque swabs of 7 patients treated for dental carries at Department of Conservative Dentistry, Medical University of Warsaw. MIC and MBC values for CSS's were evaluated. RESULTS: CSS used in this research is of good stability. No agglomeration or coalescence was observed during 24 hours of experiment. Silver nanoparticles were of round shape and had mean size of 67 nm. MIC values were: 12-25 ppm for S. salivarius, 25 ppm for S. sanguinis, 50-100 ppm for S. mitis and 50 ppm for S. mutans, while MBC values after 1 hour of bacterial contact with nanoparticles were 200-350 ppm for all cariogenic bacterial species. After 24 hours of contact MBC values were: 25-50 ppm for S. salivarius and S. sanguinis, 100-200 ppm for S. mitis and 200 ppmfor S. mutans. CONCLUSIONS: Antimicrobial properties of CSS depend on nanoparticles concentration and interaction time with bacteria. The susceptibility of cariogenic oral streptococci to silver nanoparticles is diversified. Sufficient concentration which inhibited all cariogenic bacteria in our research was 200 ppm after long (24 hours) period of silver nanoparticles interaction with bacteria.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of the risk of inducing bacterial resistance to disinfection  treatment with photolysis of hydrogen peroxide.
AB  - The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the risk of inducing bacterial resistance to disinfection treatment with photolysis of H2O2 and comparing this with existing antibacterial agents. We tested seven antibacterial agents, including amoxicillin, cefepime hydrochloride, erythromycin, ofloxacin, clindamycin hydrochloride, ciprofloxacin hydrochloride, and minocycline hydrochloride, as positive controls for validation of the assay protocol. For all of the agents tested, at least one of the four bacterial species (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, and Streptococcus salivarius) was resistant to these agents by repeated exposure to subinhibitory concentrations of the agents up to 10 times. In contrast, antibacterial activity against any of the bacterial species tested (S. aureus, E. faecalis, E. coli, S. salivarius, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus mutans, and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans) was not affected by repeated exposure to the disinfection treatment up to 40 times. This finding suggested that the risk of inducing bacterial resistance by disinfection treatment was low. The active ingredient of this disinfection treatment is hydroxyl radicals generated by photolysis of H2O2. Therefore, hydroxyl radicals interact with several cell structures and different metabolic pathways in microbial cells, probably resulting in a lack of development of bacterial resistance. In conclusion, disinfection treatment with photolysis of H2O2 appears to be a potential alternative for existing antimicrobial agents in terms of a low risk of inducing bacterial resistance.
TI  - Postantibiotic effect of disinfection treatment by photolysis of hydrogen peroxide.
AB  - The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the postantibiotic effect (PAE)  of the disinfection treatment by photolysis of H2O2. Postantibiotic effect was induced in Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus salivarius by exposing the bacteria to H2O2 at concentrations of 250-1000 mmol/l, laser irradiation at a wavelength of 405 nm, and the combination of both (photolysis of H2O2) for 10-30 seconds. The photolysis of H2O2 induced significantly longer PAE than other treatments. The PAE was augmented dependently on not only the concentration of H2O2 but the laser irradiation time. Electron spin resonance analysis showed that the hydroxyl radical was also generated dependently on both the concentration of H2O2 and the laser irradiation time, suggesting that the hydroxyl radicals contribute to the PAE. These results suggest that the disinfection treatment by photolysis of H2O2 induces PAE in S. aureus and S. salivarius even though they were treated for only 10-30 seconds.
TI  - Evaluation of the nanosphere verigene gram-positive blood culture assay with the  VersaTREK blood culture system and assessment of possible impact on selected patients.
AB  - The Verigene Gram-positive blood culture (BC-GP) assay (Nanosphere, Northbrook, IL) is a molecular method for the rapid identification of Gram-positive organisms and resistance markers directly from blood culture bottles. A total of 148 VersaTREK REDOX 1 40-ml aerobic bottles demonstrating Gram-positive bacteria were tested. Results were compared with those from conventional biochemical and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) identifications. We obtained isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (24), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) (14), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) (17), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus epidermidis (MSSE) (9), other coagulase-negative staphylococci (19), Streptococcus salivarius (5), Streptococcus parasanguinis (2), Streptococcus sanguinis (1), Streptococcus cristatus (1), the Streptococcus bovis group (5), Streptococcus agalactiae (9), the Streptococcus anginosus group (1), Streptococcus pneumoniae (6), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE FCM) (16), vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis (3), Aerococcus viridans (2), Bacillus (6), Corynebacterium (8), Lactobacillus (2), Micrococcus (2), Neisseria mucosa (1), Escherichia coli (3), Candida tropicalis (1), Propionibacterium (1), and Rothia (1). Overall agreement with the culture results was 95%. A total of 137 of 138 (99%) monomicrobial cultures were concordant. We tested 9 polymicrobial samples and found 33% agreement. A chart review of 31 patients with MRSA, MSSA, or VRE demonstrated that the Nanosphere BC-GP assay might have led to more appropriate antibiotic selection for these patients an average of 42 h earlier. Additionally, contact isolation could have been initiated an average of 37 h earlier for patients with MRSA or VRE. The BC-GP assay may have a positive impact on patient care, health care costs, and antibiotic stewardship.
TI  - Antibacterial Effect of Juglans Regia Bark against Oral Pathologic Bacteria.
AB  - Background. In this study antimicrobial effect of ethanolic and aqueous extracts  of Juglans regia bark in Iran was evaluated on four different oral bacteria, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus sanguis, and Staphylococcus aureus. Methods. Aqueous and ethanol extracts of Juglans regia bark were prepared by using disk diffusion technique and Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) methods. Tetracycline 30 mu g and Erythromycin 15 mu g were used as positive control and water as negative control in disk diffusion and MIC methods. Data were analyzed by ANOVA test. Results. The results showed that S. sanguis and S. mutans were the most sensitive and the most resistant bacteria against ethanolic and aqueous extracts, respectively. Ethanolic extract had significant antibacterial effect against all tested bacteria. Aqueous extract did not show antibacterial effect on S. mutans, in contrast to ethanolic extract. Aqueous extract had significantly antibacterial effect against Staphylococcus aureus, S. salivarius, and S. sanguis compared to control (P < 0.0001), but it did not show effect on S. mutans when compared with Erythromycin. According to the obtained MIC values, ethanol extract of Juglans regia bark had the lowest rate. Conclusion. The results may provide the basis for using natural antimicrobial substance for oral hygiene prophylaxis purposes.
TI  - Physicochemical and biological evaluation of poly(ethylene glycol) methacrylate grafted onto poly(dimethyl siloxane) surfaces for prosthetic devices.
AB  - Poly(dimethyl siloxane) (PDMS) was surface-polymerized with poly(ethylene glycol)methacrylate (PEGMA) by surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization (SI-ATRP) in aqueous media at room temperature. Modification of the PDMS surface followed a three-step procedure: (i) PDMS surface hydroxylation by UV/ozone exposure, immediately followed by (ii) covalent attachment of the initiator, 1-trichlorosilyl-2-(chloromethylphenyl)ethane, onto the hydroxylated PDMS, via chemical vapor deposition; finally (iii) PDMS surface-polymerization of PEGMA by ATRP. Modified PDMS was characterized by water contact angle measurement, SEM, FTIR-ATR, and XPS. Results showed that modified surfaces had a hydrophilic character, given the water contact angles around 60 degrees ; FTIR-ATR and XPS analysis confirmed the presence of polymerized PEGMA on the surface of PDMS and the adhesion of Staphylococcus aureus GB 2/1 and Streptococcus salivarius GB 24/9 onto the modified surfaces was inhibited 94% and 81%, respectively. Finally, the modified PDMS showed no evidence of cytotoxic effects in in vitro assays using human skin fibroblasts.
TI  - Endocarditis in adults with bacterial meningitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Endocarditis may precede or complicate bacterial meningitis, but the  incidence and impact of endocarditis in bacterial meningitis are unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS: We assessed the incidence and clinical characteristics of patients with meningitis and endocarditis from a nationwide cohort study of adults with community-acquired bacterial meningitis in the Netherlands from 2006 to 2012. Endocarditis was identified in 24 of 1025 episodes (2%) of bacterial meningitis. Cultures yielded Streptococcus pneumoniae in 13 patients, Staphylococcus aureus in 8 patients, and Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus salivarius in 1 patient each. Clues leading to the diagnosis of endocarditis were cardiac murmurs, persistent or recurrent fever, a history of heart valve disease, and S aureus as the causative pathogen of bacterial meningitis. Treatment consisted of prolonged antibiotic therapy in all patients and surgical valve replacement in 10 patients (42%). Two patients were treated with oral anticoagulants, and both developed life-threatening intracerebral hemorrhage. Systemic (70%) and neurological (54%) complications occurred frequently, leading to a high proportion of patients with unfavorable outcome (63%). Seven of 24 patients (29%) with meningitis and endocarditis died. CONCLUSIONS: Endocarditis is an uncommon coexisting condition in bacterial meningitis but is associated with a high rate of unfavorable outcome.
TI  - Reactive oxygen species and the bacteriostatic and bactericidal effects of isoconazole nitrate.
AB  - Bacterial superinfections often occur in dermatomycoses, resulting in greatly inflamed or eczematous skin. The objective of this study was to evaluate the antibacterial efficacy of isoconazole nitrate (ISN), a broad-spectrum antimicrobial imidazole, commonly used to treat dermatomycoses. Several gram-positive bacteria minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for ISN (ISN solution or ISN-containing creams: Travogen or corticosteroid-containing Travocort) and ampicillin were obtained using the broth-dilution method. Speed of onset of the bactericidal effect was determined with bacterial killing curves. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) were visualised by staining cells with singlet oxygen detector stain. Compared with ampicillin MICs, ISN MICs for Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus haemolyticus and Staphylococcus hominis were lower and ISN MICs for Corynebacterium tuberculostearicum and Streptococcus salivarius were similar. Incubation with ISN led to a 50% kill rate for Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant strains (MRSA). Post-ISN incubation, 36% (30 min) and 90% (60 min) of S. aureus cells were positive for ROS. Isoconazole nitrate has a broad bacteriostatic and bactericidal action, also against a MRSA strain that was not reduced by the corticosteroid in the Travocort cream. Data suggest that the antibacterial effect of ISN may be ROS dependent. An antifungal agent with robust antibacterial activity can provide a therapeutic advantage in treating dermatomycoses with suspected bacterial superinfections.
TI  - Microbial contamination associated with consumption and the growth in plastic bottled beverage.
AB  - Plastic bottles enable the storage of unfinished beverages, and most of microbial contamination has occurred in the unfinished beverage that was left. Therefore, we investigated microorganisms in various beverages contaminated by pouring and drinking directly by mouth from the bottle, and analyzed the growth of microorganisms in the beverages at room temperature. In the pouring test, microbial growth was detected in 60 of 320 samples, and 13 bacterial strains, 49 mold strains, and 8 yeast strains were isolated. Molds including Cladosporium spp., Tramets spp., Bjerkandera spp., and Penicillium spp. accounted for the majority of isolated microorganisms. In the drinking test, microbial growth was detected in 181 of 352 samples, and 225 bacterial strains, 27 mold strains and 77 yeast strains were isolated. Bacteria including Streptococcus spp. such as S. salivarius and Staphylococcus spp. such as S. aureus accounted for the majority of isolated microorganisms. Enterotoxin-producing S. aureus and Bacillus cereus were also isolated. The pH of the beverage influenced the growth of bacteria. The Brix values of the beverage did not correlate with the growth of microorganisms. These results revealed that various microorganisms including foodborne pathogens were able to grow in numerous types of beverages and that the storage of unfinished beverage in inappropriate condition, such as the storage at room temperature led microorganism to grow easily in beverage. Therefore, it is necessary to consume beverages as soon as possible after opening the bottle.
TI  - In-vitro activity of saponins of bauhinia purpurea, madhuca longifolia, celastrus paniculatus and semecarpus anacardium on selected oral pathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Dental caries, periodontitis and other mucosal diseases are caused by  a complex community of microorganisms. This study aimed to investigate the antimicrobial properties of saponins of four important oil yielding medicinal plant extracts on selected oral pathogens that are involved in such diseases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Saponins were extracted from Bauhinia purpurea, Madhuca longifolia, Celastrus paniculatus and Semecarpus anacardium and purified. Antimicrobial properties of these saponins against Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus salivarius, Staphylococcus aureus and Lactobacillus acidophilus were determined using well diffusion method. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined as the lowest concentration of saponins inhibiting bacterial growth after 14 h of incubation at 37 degrees C. The bactericidal activity was evaluated using the viable cell count method. RESULTS: The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of Madhuca longifolia saponin on Streptococcus mutans MTCC 890, Streptococcus mitis and Staphylococcus aureus was 18.3 +/- 0.15/34.4 +/- 0.24 mug/ml, 19.0 +/- 0.05/32.2 +/- 0.0 mug/ml and 21.2 +/- 0.35/39.0 +/- 0.30 mug/ml, respectively and Bauhinia purpurea saponin on Streptococcus mutans MTCC 890, Staphylococcus aureus and Lactobacillus acidophilus was 26.4 +/- 0.20/43.0 +/- 0.40 mug/ml, 29.0 +/- 0.30/39.6 +/- 0.12 mug/ml and 20.2 +/- 0.05/36.8 +/- 0.23 mug/ml, respectively. CONCLUSION: The strong antimicrobial activity of Madhuca longifolia and Bauhinia purpurea may be due to the presence of complex triterpenoid saponins, oleanane type triterpenoid glycosides or atypical pentacyclic triterpenoid saponin. Hence, these extracted saponins may be used in food and oral products to prevent and control oral diseases.
TI  - Inhibition of Candida albicans yeast-hyphal transition and biofilm formation by Solidago virgaurea water extracts.
AB  - Xerostomia is a decrease of saliva secretion, which can unbalance the oral microflora, mainly to the benefit of Candida albicans. The aim of the present study was to find a plant extract that could create an unfavourable environment for Candida, and would, therefore, be appropriate for use in a dry-mouth daily-care mouthwash. Water extract from the herbaceous plant Solidago virgaurea (Goldenrod) was selected due to its saponin content (plant detergents). Saponin concentrations reached 0.7 and 0.95 mg ml(-1) in S. virgaurea subsp. virgaurea and S. virgaurea subsp. alpestris extracts, respectively. C. albicans was grown in liquid medium and cells were counted by microscopic examination after 0, 4 and 24 h of incubation. Solidago extracts did not inhibit the growth of C. albicans (four strains), Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius or Enterococcus faecalis. When inocula were incubated with Solidago extract for 4 and 24 h, we observed a decrease in Candida yeast-hyphal transition. Candida biofilms were then prepared in microtitre plates and treated with plant extracts at 0 h, to estimate biofilm formation, or at 18 h to estimate the effect of the saponin on pre-formed biofilms. Biofilm formation and pre-formed biofilms were both strongly inhibited. In conclusion, the S. virgaurea extract was efficient against two key virulence factors of C. albicans: the yeast-hyphal transition phase and biofilm formation.
TI  - Antibacterial and antifungal activities of punica granatum peel extracts against  oral pathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Punica granatum has been used for many years in folk medicine due to several purposes. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of methanolic extract of Punica granatum peel (MEPGP) against Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus sanguinis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Actynomyces viscosus, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Candida albicans. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this in vitro study, the mentioned oral organisms were cultured in blood agar and mueller-hinton media and then paper disks containing MEPGP at concentrations of 4 mg/ml, 8 mg/ml and 12 mg/ml were inserted on medias. The antimicrobial activity was evaluated by agar disk diffusion method. The effects of three different concentrations of MEPGP against microorganisms were compared using one-way ANOVA and Tukey tests. RESULTS: All concentrations of MEPGP had antibacterial activity against S. aureus and S. epidermidis. Only at concentration of 8 mg/ml and 12 mg/ml MEPGP was effective against L. acidophilus, S. mutans and S. salivarius. Furthermore; no concentrations of MEPGP inhibited A. viscosus and C. albicans. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that MEPGP might be used as an antibacterial agent in controlling oral infections.
TI  - Evaluating the In-vitro Antibacterial Effect of Iranian Propolis on Oral Microorganisms.
AB  - Propolis has traditionally been used in curing infections and healing wounds and  burns. Current researches have shown that propolis has antibacterial, antifungal and antiviral actions however, the pharmacological activity of propolis is highly variable depending on its geographic origin. There have been few studies on the effects of Iranian propolis on the oral microorganisms. In this in-vitro study, the antimicrobial activity of the ethanolic and water extracts of the Iranian propolis (10%, w/v) from north-east area of Tehran was evaluated. Susceptibility of the oral strains tested (Streptococcus mutans ATCC 35668; Streptococcus salivarius ATCC 9222; Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923; Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 9854 and Lactobacillus casei ATCC 39392) was evaluated using the agar diffusion method at a concentration of 20 mg/mL of propolis and the zones of growth inhibition were measured. Antibacterial activity was determined by using minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) at different concentrations of propolis. The ethanolic extract showed bacteriostatic and bactericidal activity against all the strains, with MIC and MBC ranges of 250-500 microg/mL. The MIC concentration of the water extract was 500 microg/mL against S. mutans and E. faecalis. The water extract showed bactericidal activity only against S. mutans (20 mg/mL). These results indicate that the ethanolic extract is probably more useful in the control of oral biofilms and subsequent dental caries development. However, to determine the consequence of the ethanolic extract of Iranian propolis on the oral mucosa, in-vivo studies of its possible effects are needed.
TI  - Ozone in dentistry: microbiological effects of gas action depending on the method and the time of application using the ozonytron device. Experimental study.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Bactericidal, virucidal, and fungicidal activity of ozone is generally known and has been exploited for years in industry and medicine. Ozone therapy became an inherent element of the treatment of infection in such fields as surgery, dermatology, cosmetics, and dentistry. Ozone is a gas, so it penetrates very well even into such tissues and spaces that are not easily accessible. Thanks to the property of deep penetration and long ozone presence in tissues after treatment, a long-lasting bactericidal effect is achieved. The action of oxygen radicals is, however, not neutral for the human organism, therefore the use of an appropriate procedure and therapy algorithms is essential. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We decided to confirm the effect of antibacterial activity of ozone applied by means of the Ozonytron device (made by Biozonix) on model strains of Streptococcus salivarius, pneumonia, pyogenes, and agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus and epidermidis, using two application patterns developed by us. RESULTS: We found a statistically significant difference in the size of zones of inhibited bacterial growth on all media depending on the time of action of ozone. In the present paper, the bactericidal activity of ozone in relation to bacterial strains that are most frequently isolated from the oral cavity was confirmed. What is more, two models of application of the gas on the infected medium were compared. CONCLUSION: Research on the use of ozone in combatting bacteria typical for dental diseases has shown that the gas has an oxidizing effect on these bacteria and is bactericidal.
TI  - Screening of Quercus infectoria gall extracts as anti-bacterial agents against dental pathogens.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: A number of bacteria have now become antibiotic-resistant. This increases the importance of ayurvedic drugs. We report, here, the activity of different extracts (petroleum ether, chloroform, methanol and water) of Quercus infectoria galls against dental pathogens -- Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, Staphylococcus aureus, Lactobacillus acidophilus (designated) and Streptococcus sanguis (isolated). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The cup-plate method was used in anti-bacterial activity of the extracts at concentration of 200 mg/ml against dental pathogens. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of most effective extracts against the most susceptible bacteria were determined using a two-fold serial micro dilution method. RESULTS: Methanolic extract showed maximum anti-bacterial activity against all the bacteria. The most susceptible bacteria were S. sanguis followed by S. aureus, S. mutans, S. salivarius and L. acidophilus. The MIC values showed that methanolic extract was more effective than water extract. CONCLUSION: The plant has the potential to generate herbal metabolites. The crude extracts demonstrating anti-dental caries activity could result in the discovery of new chemical classes of antibiotics. These chemical classes of antibiotics could serve as selective agents for the maintenance of human health and provide bio-chemical tools for the study of infectious diseases.
TI  - Rhodomyrtone: a new candidate as natural antibacterial drug from Rhodomyrtus tomentosa.
AB  - Rhodomyrtone [6,8-dihydroxy-2,2,4,4-tetramethyl-7-(3-methyl-1-oxobutyl)-9-(2-methylpropyl)-4,9 -dihydro-1H-xanthene-1,3(2H)-di-one] from Rhodomyrtus tomentosa (Aiton) Hassk. displayed significant antibacterial activities against gram-positive bacteria including Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus salivarius. Especially noteworthy was the activity against MRSA with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and a minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) ranging from 0.39 to 0.78 microg/ml. As shown for S. pyogenes, no surviving cells were detected within 5 and 6h after treatment with the compound at 8MBC and 4MBC concentrations, respectively. Rhodomyrtone displays no bacteriolytic activity, as determined by measurement of the optical density at 620 nm. A rhodomyrtone killing test with S. mutans using phase contrast microscopy showed that this compound caused a few morphological changes as the treated cells were slightly changed in color and bigger than the control when they were killed. Taken together, the results support the view that rhodomyrtone has a strong bactericidal activity on gram-positive bacteria, including major pathogens.
TI  - Streptococci and lactococci synthesize large amounts of HPr(Ser-P)(His~P).
AB  - HPr is a protein of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase transport system (PTS). In gram-positive bacteria, HPr can be phosphorylated on Ser-46 by the kinase/phosphorylase HprK/P and on His-15 by phospho-enzyme I (EI~P) of the PTS. In vitro studies with purified HPrs from Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus salivarius have indicated that the phosphorylation of one residue impedes the phosphorylation of the other. However, a recent study showed that while the rate of Streptococcus salivarius HPr phosphorylation by EI~P is reduced at acidic pH, the phosphorylation of HPr(Ser-P) by EI~P, generating HPr(Ser-P)(His~P), is stimulated. This suggests that HPr(Ser-P)(His~P) synthesis may occur in acidogenic bacteria unable to maintain their intracellular pH near neutrality. Consistent with this hypothesis, significant amounts of HPr(Ser-P)(His~P) have been detected in some streptococci. The present study was aimed at determining whether the capacity to synthesize HPr(Ser-P)(His~P) is common to streptococcal species, as well as to lactococci, which are also unable to maintain their intracellular pH near neutrality in response to a decrease in extracellular pH. Our results indicated that unlike Staphylococcus aureus, B. subtilis, and E. faecalis, all the streptococcal and lactococcal species tested were able to synthesize large amounts of HPr(Ser-P)(His~P) during growth. We also showed that Streptococcus salivarius IIABLMan, a protein involved in sugar transport by the PTS, could be efficiently phosphorylated by HPr(Ser-P)(His~P).
TI  - A quantitative approach to the effectiveness of ozone against microbiota organisms colonizing toothbrushes.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Toothbrushes are rapidly contaminated with different microorganisms,  which colonize the oral cavity and interdental spaces. This can represent a possible cause of infection or reinfection. In this study, the ozone experimental effect upon toothbrushes microflora was estimated microbiologically before and after saturation with ozone gas. METHODS: Fifty used toothbrushes coming from children and adults were entered our study. Microorganisms were enumerated and identified. Bristles from each brush were soaked in ozone saturated PBS solution for 5, 10, 15, 20 and 30 min and the total microbial population was reassessed. RESULTS: Counts of microorganisms isolated per brush varied between 10(2) and 10(7) CFU. Candida albicans was present in used toothbrushes. No obligate anaerobes were isolated. Members of Streptococcaceae family were regularly found (65.2%) belonging to the following species: Streptococcus pyogenes, S. mutans, S. mitis, S. oralis, S. sobrinus, S. viridans, S. salivarius, S. sanguis, Aerococcus viridans. A. viridans and S. mutans were more frequently isolated on children toothbrushes while Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis were found on adults brushes. Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas sp. and Enterococcus sp., were also recovered. We found that the ozone treatment decreased gradually the microbial load. However, a bacterial re-growth was effective following short ozonation period. Decontamination was complete after an extended exposure to ozone for 30 min. CONCLUSIONS: Ozone application was found to remove the toothbrushes bristles microbiota following conventional brushing. Maximum decontamination efficacy of ozone treatment was observed after 30 min while exposure for short time periods seems to be inefficient which probably reflect the low dose of ozone used in this study.
TI  - Purification of bacteriocin LS1 produced by human oral isolate Lactobacillus salivarius BGHO1.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Lactobacillus salivarius BGHO1, a human oral isolate with antagonistic activity against growth of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Micrococcus flavus, and Salmonella enteritidis, probably produces more than one proteinaceous antimicrobial substance. The objective of this study was the purification of a bacteriocin, named LS1, produced by L. salivarius BGHO1. METHODS: A simple and fast procedure for bacteriocin purification was developed, consisting of reverse-phase chromatography of the ammonium sulfate precipitate of cell-free culture supernatant by fast protein liquid chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography, followed by tricine sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), with the subsequent extraction of bacteriocin from the gel. RESULTS: The supernatant of L. salivarius BGHO1 culture retained its antimicrobial activity after boiling in a water bath for 15 min. Its antimicrobial activity was also maintained even after treatment for 20 min at 121 degrees C in an autoclave. Bacteriocin LS1 was purified to homogeneity. The molecular mass of bacteriocin LS1 was estimated to be approximately 10 kDa, based on tricine SDS-PAGE. During purification, another compound with antimicrobial activity, produced by L. salivarius BGHO1, was detected. The molecular mass of this compound was estimated to be approximately 5 kDa, based on tricine SDS-PAGE. CONCLUSION: Our results imply that LS1 is most probably a new bacteriocin, different from previously described bacteriocins produced by L. salivarius strains. The purification of bacteriocin LS1 enabled the further characterization of LS1 on both the molecular and genetic levels.
TI  - Characterization of mucosal biofilms on human adenoid tissues.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To demonstrate the presence of mucosal biofilm in adenoid tissue using double staining for visualization of both the bacterial matrix and the bacterial cells. To identify bacterial species present on the surface of the studied adenoids. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective study. METHODS: A total of 39 specimens of adenoidectomy were removed from children with chronic and/or recurrent otitis media. The specimens were prepared for light microscopy using Gram staining, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Double staining was performed with CLSM to visualize both the bacteria and the glycocalyx matrix. Nine adenoids on which bacterial biofilms were visualized with CLSM were used for identification of bacterial species by 16S-DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and homology analysis. RESULTS: Of the 39 adenoids investigated, 22 (54%) showed evidence of mucosal biofilms. Gram staining, SEM and CLSM showed the presence of bacterial cells, organized in bacterial microcolonies. CLSM with double staining demonstrated mucosal biofilms by showing the presence of both bacteria and the glycocalyx. The use of 16S-DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and subsequent sequence analyses identified the presence of Corynebacterium argentoratense, Streptococcus salivarius, Micrococcus luteus, and Staphylococcus aureus. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that adenoid tissue in children with chronic or/and recurrent otitis media contains mucosal biofilms in 54% of the cases. The existence of living bacteria has been demonstrated. Further studies are required to describe the panel of bacteria that can be harbored in the biofilms present in adenoids and the mechanisms involved in the physiopathology of otitis prone children.
TI  - Synthesis and characterization of surface-grafted polyacrylamide brushes and their inhibition of microbial adhesion.
AB  - A method is presented to prevent microbial adhesion to solid surfaces exploiting  the unique properties of polymer brushes. Polyacrylamide (PAAm) brushes were grown from silicon wafers by atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) using a three-step reaction procedure consisting of immobilization of a coupling agent gamma-aminopropyltriethoxysilane, anchoring of an ATRP initiator 4-(chloromethyl)benzoyl chloride, and controlled radical polymerization of acrylamide. The surfaces were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, ellipsometry, and contact-angle measurements. The calculated grafting density pointed to the presence of a dense and homogeneous polymer brush. Initial deposition rates, adhesion after 4 h, and detachment of two bacterial strains (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 12600 and Streptococcus salivarius GB 24/9) and one yeast strain (Candida albicans GB 1/2) to both PAAm-coated and untreated silicon surfaces were investigated in a parallel plate flow chamber. A high reduction (70-92%) in microbial adhesion to the surface-grafted PAAm brush was observed, as compared with untreated silicon surfaces. Application of the proposed grafting method to silicone rubbers may offer great potential to prevent biomaterials-centered infection of implants.
TI  - Molecular and biochemical characterizations of human oral lactobacilli as putative probiotic candidates.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The objective of this study was to characterize the lactobacilli from the human oral cavity as a potential source of probiotic strains. METHODS: Samples were collected from four different locations within the oral cavity: surface of healthy tooth, oral mucous membrane, surface of tooth decay and deep tooth decay. On the basis of morphological and biochemical properties eight categories were formed and 26 isolates were selected for further characterization. The isolates were determined as Lactobacillus sp. using primers specific for 16S rDNA. Sequencing of 16S rDNA genes and repetitive sequence-based polymerase chain reactions were used for determination to species and subspecies levels. RESULTS: Predominant species were Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus salivarius and Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei, while Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus cellobiosus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis and Lactobacillus gasseri were also present. The isolates Lactobacillus salivarius BGHO1, Lactobacillus fermentum BGHO36 and BGHO64, Lactobacillus gasseri BGHO89 and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis BGHO99 exhibited antagonistic action on the growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Micrococcus flavus, Salmonella enteritidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus mutans, but not on growth of Candida albicans. Moreover, the isolates L. salivarius BGHO1 and L. gasseri BGHO89 were tolerant to low pH and high concentration of bile salts. CONCLUSION: Taken together, these findings imply that L. salivarius BGHO1 and L. gasseri BGHO89 might be subjects for additional investigation as potential probiotic strains.
TI  - Interference in adhesion of bacteria and yeasts isolated from explanted voice prostheses to silicone rubber by rhamnolipid biosurfactants.
AB  - AIMS: The effects and extent of adhesion of four different bacterial and two yeast strains isolated from explanted voice prostheses to silicone rubber with and without an adsorbed rhamnolipid biosurfactant layer obtained from Pseudomonasaeruginosa DS10-129 was studied. METHODS AND RESULTS: The ability of rhamnolipid biosurfactant to inhibit adhesion of micro-organisms to silicone rubber was investigated in a parallel-plate flow chamber. The anti-adhesive activity of the biosurfactant at different concentrations was significant against all the strains and depended on the micro-organism tested. The results showed an effective reduction in the initial deposition rates, and the number of bacterial cells adhering after 4 h, for all micro-organisms tested at the 4 g l(-1) undiluted rhamnolipid solution. Maximum initial reduction of adhesion rate (an average of 66%) occurred for Streptococcus salivarius GB 24/9 and Candida tropicalis GB 9/9. The number of cells adhering after 4 h on silicone rubber conditioned with biosurfactant was reduced to 48% for Staphylococcus epidermidis GB 9/6, Strep. salivarius GB 24/9, Staphylococcus aureus GB 2/1 and C. tropicalis GB 9/9 in comparison to controls. Perfusing the flow chamber with biosurfactant containing solution followed by the passage of a liquid-air interface, to investigate detachment of micro-organisms adhering to silicone rubber, produced high detachment (96%) of adhered cells for all micro-organisms studied, except for Staph. aureus GB 2/1 (67%). SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: It is concluded that biosurfactant represent suitable compounds that should be considered in developing future strategies to prevent the microbial colonization of silicone rubber voice prostheses.
TI  - Cell adsorption and selective desorption for separation of microbial cells by using chitosan-immobilized silica.
AB  - Cell adsorption and selective desorption for separation of microbial cells were conducted by using chitosan-immobilized silica (CIS). When chitosan was immobilized onto silica surfaces with glutaraldehyde, bacterial cells adsorbed well and retained viability. Testing of the adsorption and desorption ability of CIS using various microbes such as Escherichia coli, Aeromonas hydrophila, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Lactobacillus casei, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Streptococcus salivarius, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Saccharomyces ludwigii, and Schizosaccharomyces pombe revealed that most microbes could be adsorbed and selectively desorbed under different conditions. In particular, recovery was improved when L-cysteine was added. A mixture of two bacterial strains adsorbed onto CIS could also be successfully separated by use of specific solutions for each strain. Most of the desorbed cells were alive. Thus, quantitative and selective fractionation of cells is readily achievable by employing chitosan, a known antibacterial material.
TI  - In vitro activity of daptomycin against clinical isolates of Gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - We determined the activity of daptomycin, a recently FDA-approved antimicrobial agent, against clinical isolates of Gram-positive bacteria, including viridans group streptococci (16 Streptococcus mitis species group, 12 S. mutans species group, 9 S. anginosus species group, 8 S. sanguinis species group, 5 S. salivarius species group) from patients with infective endocarditis, 32 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, 32 high-level penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, 38 vancomycin-resistant enterococci (including 1 linezolid-resistant isolate), and the following unusual Gram-positive bacteria: 3 Listeria monocytogenes, 4 Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, 9 Corynebacterium species, 10 Abiotrophia/Granulicatella species, 2 Rothia (Stomatococcus) mucilaginosus, and 4 Gemella morbillorum. Daptomycin minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)(90) values for the viridans group streptococci, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae, and Enterococcus species were 0.5, 0.5, < or =0.125, and 4 microg/ml, respectively. The daptomycin MIC range for the unusual Gram-positive bacteria was < or =0.125-2 microg/ml. We conclude that daptomycin has in vitro activity against viridans group streptococci associated with endocarditis as well as against several types of unusual Gram-positive bacteria that can cause endocarditis.
TI  - Study of viridans streptococci and Staphylococcus species in cleft lip and palate patients before and after surgery.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of surgery on types and colony count of Streptococcus and Staphylococcus species in cleft lip and palate (CLP) patients. DESIGN: Saliva samples were collected after the morning meal by placing a sterile cotton swab in the vestibule of the oral cavity from cleft lip and palate patients immediately preoperative and 12 weeks postoperative. Normal children were examined as a control group. Samples were cultured; Staphylococcus and Streptococcus isolates were identified and quantified. PATIENTS: Fifteen cleft lip and palate patients and 22 normal children, aged 3 to 39 months were examined. RESULTS: Streptococcus mitis biovar 1, Streptococcus salivarius and Streptococcus oralis of the viridans group of streptococci were the most commonly found in normal children, as well as in cleft lip and palate children. In the cleft lip and palate group, mean streptococcal count was 32.41 (29.80) and 46.46 (42.80) in the pre- and postoperative periods, respectively; in the normal group, the count was 20.93 (27.93) and 49.92 (34.72) at 0 week and 12 weeks, respectively. Staphylococcus aureus was the most common Staphylococcus species found in CLP patients, representing 47.4% postoperatively. In the cleft lip and palate children, mean staphylococcal count was 5.34 (8.13) and 0.56 (0.92) in the pre- and postoperative periods, respectively; in normal children, the count was 0.82 (1.98) and 0.60 (2.55) at 0 and 12 weeks, respectively. The differences were statistically significant only for the staphylococcal count between pre- and postoperative periods in children with cleft lip and palate as tested by analysis of variance (p < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Cleft lip and palate patients had more colonization by S. aureus compared with normal children, and the colony count decreased significantly following surgical repair of the cleft lip and palate.
TI  - Bacterial populations on silicone hydrogel and hydrogel contact lenses after swimming in a chlorinated pool.
AB  - PURPOSE: A number of reports have indicated an association between swimming with  contact lenses and subsequent eye infection. This study tests whether a hydrophilic contact lens worn while swimming accumulates bacteria present in the water. It was of interest to determine whether lens type (silicone hydrogel vs. hydrogel) affected the result. METHODS: Fifteen healthy noncontact lens wearers swam for 30 minutes with a silicone hydrogel lens (PureVision, Bausch & Lomb, Rochester, NY) on one eye and a hydrogel lens (Acuvue 2, Vistakon Inc., Jacksonville, FL) on the other. Lenses were removed aseptically and placed in sterile vials 10 minutes after the subjects left the water. Microbial growth was enumerated for total numbers of colonies and categorized by species present. Numbers of colonies were compared between the two lens groups and with a water sample taken from the pool at the time of the experiment. Eight of the subjects returned on a different day and wore new lenses for 50 minutes in normal room conditions. RESULTS: Two lenses were lost while swimming. Twenty-seven of the remaining 28 lenses worn while swimming showed colonization, principally with Staphylococcus epidermidis, which was also by far the most common species identified from the water itself. Small numbers of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus salivarius were also present in the water and on the lenses. Numbers of colonies varied among subjects (range, 0 to 230), but no differences were observed between the two lens groups. Lenses removed after 30 minutes of wear without swimming were mostly sterile, with 3 of 16 lenses showing just two colonies each. CONCLUSION: It appears that wearing a hydrophilic lens while swimming allows accumulation of microbial organisms on or in the lens, regardless of lens material. Swimmers should be advised to wear tight-fitting goggles if lenses are worn while swimming, and thorough disinfection of the lenses before overnight wear seems prudent.
TI  - Screening of lactic-acid bacteria from South African barley beer for the production of bacteriocin-like compounds.
AB  - Strains of Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei (strain ST11BR), L. pentosus  (strain ST151BR), L. plantarum (strain ST13BR), and Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (strain ST34BR) producing bacteriocin-like peptides were isolated from barley beer produced in the Western, Northern and Eastern provinces of South Africa. The peptides (bacST11BR, bacST151BR, bacST13BR and bacST34BR) lost their activity after treatment with proteinase K, a proteinase, papain, chymotrypsin, trypsin, pepsin and pronase, but not when they were treated with alpha-amylase, suggesting that the peptides are not glycosylated. The peptides inhibited the growth of Lactobacillus casei, L. sakei, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis, but not Enterobacter cloacae, Lactobacillus bulgaricus subsp. delbrueckii, L. plantarum, L. salivarius, Listeria innocua, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus uberis, S. agalactiae, S. caprinus and S. pneumoniae. Peptides bacST11BR and bacST13BR differed from the other 2 peptides by failing to kill Klebsiella pneumoniae and one of the E. coli strains. Peptides were stable after 2 h of incubation at pH 2.0-12.0, and after 90 min at 100 degrees C. When autoclaved (121 degrees C, 20 min), only bacST13BR lost its activity. The bacteriocin-like peptides were produced at a growth temperature of 30 degrees C, but not at 37 degrees C.
TI  - Biosurfactant from Lactococcus lactis 53 inhibits microbial adhesion on silicone  rubber.
AB  - The ability of biosurfactant obtained from the probiotic bacterium Lactococcus lactis 53 to inhibit adhesion of four bacterial and two yeast strains isolated from explanted voice prostheses to silicone rubber with and without an adsorbed biosurfactant layer was investigated in a parallel-plate flow chamber. The microbial cell surfaces and the silicone rubber with and without an adsorbed biosurfactant layer were characterized using contact-angle measurements. Water contact angles indicated that the silicone-rubber surface with adsorbed biosurfactant was more hydrophilic (48 degrees) than bare silicone rubber (109 degrees). The results showed that the biosurfactant was effective in decreasing the initial deposition rates of Staphylococcus epidermidis GB 9/6 from 2,100 to 220 microorganisms cm(-2) s(-1), Streptococcus salivarius GB 24/9 from 1560 to 137 microorganisms cm(-2) s(-1), and Staphylococcus aureus GB 2/1 from 1255 to 135 microorganisms cm(-2) s(-1), allowing for a 90% reduction of the deposition rates. The deposition rates of Rothia dentocariosa GBJ 52/2B, Candida albicans GBJ 13/4A, and Candida tropicalis GB 9/9 were far less reduced in the presence of the biosurfactant as compared with the other strains. This study constitutes a step ahead in developing strategies to prevent microbial colonization of silicone-rubber voice prostheses.
TI  - [Streptococcus salivarius meningitis after spinal anesthesia].
AB  - Streptococcus salivarius is a usual commensal of skin, gastrointestinal tract, genitourinary tract, oral cavity and paranasal sinuses. Although it is usually considered to have low virulence, S. salivarius may cause life-threatening infections, particularly endocarditis. On the other hand, bacterial meningitis after spinal anesthesia is very rare, there being some reported cases caused by S. salivarius, S. mitis, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis. We report a 57 year old man who developed meningitis symptoms within 10 h of an uncomplicated inguinal herniorrhaphy performed during spinal anesthesia. Cerebrospinal cultures grew S. salivarius sensitive to penicillin. The patient was successfully treated with penicillin G and left the hospital without sequelae. In the literature, bacterial meningitis due to S. salivarius is rarely reported. Of the 28 cases, 18 occurred after lumbar puncture for diagnostic or for spinal anesthesia, 5 occurred following a bacteriemia for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy or intestinal neoplasia, and the other 5 in patients who had dural defects. We discuss the possible etiological causes of the meningitis due to S. salivarius cases reports. The early recognition of this entity and the aseptic precautions likely to reduce the incidence of infectious complications after lumbar puncture are stressed.
TI  - [Nosocomial infections in a general surgical ward].
AB  - According to the National Nosocomial Infection Surveillance system we analysed the post-surgical nosocomial infections in a surgery ward of Perugia University. Between May 2000 and April 2001, 677 patients were enrolled mean age 51.5 years: 355 (52%) male, 462 (68%) ASA score 1, "clean" surgery in 355 cases (52%), cephazolin prophylaxis in 256 (38%); 11 (2%) patients deceased perioperatively. A total of 37 nosocomial infections, in 33 patients, were detected: 18 pneumonia (48.6%), 10 surgical site infections (27%) with 18 isolated: 12 gram-negative (E. coli 3, Acinetobacter baumannii 2, Providencia stuartii 2, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 2, Achromobacter spp. 1, Citrobacter freundii 1, Morganella morgani 1) and 6 gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus meticillin resistant 3, Enterococcus faecalis 2, Streptococcus salivarius 1); 7 sepsis (19%) due to 7 gram-positive (S. aureus meticillin resistant 4, S. aureus meticillin susceptible 1, Staphylococcus coagulase negative 1, Clostridium spp 1), 2 urinary tract infections (5.4%). Patients without infections and with nosocomial infections spent in hospital 6.3 and 16.6 days respectively. We can image that in one year 53 surgical procedure were lost, with a lost gain of 79.500-291.500 euro/year.
TI  - Viridans streptococcus bacteremia in children on chemotherapy for cancer: an underestimated problem.
AB  - The authors discuss the morbidity associated with viridans streptococcus bacteremia, and its implications on the choice of antibiotics used as prophylaxis and treatment. They retrospectively studied the case notes of 38 children who were being treated for various malignant conditions in their unit and developed 40 episodes of bacteremia with viridans streptococci between October 1995 and January 1999. Viridans streptococci were the third commonest blood culture isolate during this period, after coagulase-negative staphylococci and Staphylococcus aureus. The majority of the isolates were Streptococcus mitis (55%). Others were S. sanguis (25%), S. oralis (12.5%), S. salivarius (5%), and S. acidominimus (2.5%). Twenty-five percent of the patients had been treated with regimens that included cytosine arabinoside, 60% were receiving prophylactic co-trimoxazole, and 87.5% were neutropenic. Thirty percent of patients had abnormal chest X-rays, and 15% were hypotensive; 2 patients required admission to the intensive care unit. Initial antibiotic therapy was changed because of failure of clinical response in 60% of cases, despite the infecting organism being sensitive in vitro. This study confirms the importance of viridans streptococci as a cause of bacteremia in pediatric hematology and oncology patients, leading to significant morbidity. Further work is required to establish the optimal treatment for viridans streptococcus bacteremia.
TI  - Inhibition of adhesion of yeasts and bacteria by poly(ethylene oxide)-brushes on  glass in a parallel plate flow chamber.
AB  - Poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO)-brushes are generally recognized as protein-repellent  surfaces, and although a role in discouraging microbial adhesion has been established for some strains and species, no study exists on the effects of PEO-brushes on a large variety of bacterial and yeast strains. In this paper, a PEO-brush has been covalently attached to glass and silica by reaction in a polymer melt. Subsequently, the presence of a PEO-brush was demonstrated using contact angle measurements, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and ellipsometry. For five bacterial (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus salivarius, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and two yeast strains (Candida albicans and Candida tropicalis), adhesion to PEO-brushes was compared with adhesion to bare glass in a parallel plate flow chamber. The initial deposition rates of Sta. epidermidis, Sta. aureus and Str. salivarius to glass were relatively high, between 2400 and 2600 cm(-2) s(-1), while E. coli and P. aeruginosa deposited much more slowly. The initial deposition rates of the yeasts to glass were 144 and 444 cm(-2) s(-1) for C. albicans GB 1/2 and C. tropicalis GB 9/9, respectively. Coating of the glass surface with a PEO-brush yielded more than 98 % reduction in bacterial adhesion, although for the more hydrophobic P. aeruginosa a smaller reduction was observed. For both yeast species adhesion suppression was less effective than for the bacteria and here too the more hydrophobic C. tropicalis showed less reduction than the more hydrophilic C. albicans. The PEO-brush had a thickness of 22 nm in water, as inferred from ellipsometry. Assuming that on bare glass the adhered micro-organisms are positioned only a few nanometers away from the surface and that the brush keeps them at a distance of 22 nm, it is calculated that the brush yields a sevenfold attenuation of the Lifshitz-Van der Waals attraction to the surface between the micro-organisms and the surface. Decreased Lifshitz-van der Waals attraction may be responsible for the suppression of the microbial adhesion observed.
TI  - Palmitoleic acid isomer (C16:1delta6) in human skin sebum is effective against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The percent lipid composition of pooled human sebum analyzed by thin-layer chromatography was: ceramides (13%), fatty acid (47%), cholesterol (7%), cholesterol esters (2%), squalene (11%), triglycerides (3%), and wax esters (17%). Total sebum lipids (2- 4 mg/ml), sonicated into bacterial culture medium, caused 4- to 5-fold log reduction in growth of gram-positive bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus salivarius and the anaerobe Fusobacterium nucleatum, but was ineffective against most gram-negative bacteria. Fractionation of the sebum lipids showed that both saturated and unsaturated fatty acids contained the bulk of the antimicrobial activity. Lauric acid (C12:0) was the most active saturated fatty acid. The unsaturated fatty acid, palmitoleic acid (C16:1delta6, cPA) was both the most predominant monoene and the most active antimicrobial fatty acid. Purified cPA (>99%) yielded typical minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of 10-20 microg/ml against gram-positive bacteria. Organically synthesized cPA isomer gave MIC values comparable to the natural material. Both natural and synthetic cPA were found to be the most active sebum lipid fraction in blocking the adherence of a pathogenic strain of Candida albicans to porcine stratum corneum. Ethanol in combination with cPA exerts a synergistic bactericidal activity against gram-negative pathogenic bacteria, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Propionibacterium acnes, Escherichia coli, and several methacillin-resistant strains of S. aureus. Palmitoleic acid may be useful in topical formulations for treatment of secondary gram-positive bacterial infections, as a gram-positive bacteria antimicrobial in wound dressings, and as a natural gram-positive antimicrobial preservative in skin and hair care products.
TI  - Identification and screening for antimicrobial activity against Clostridium difficile of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus species isolated from healthy infant faeces.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity against Clostridium difficile of 109 lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from 32 healthy Korean infants was measured. The ability to show similar activity against Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Staphylococcus aureus was also looked for. Twelve of the 109 LAB showed activity against C. difficile and 19 strains were active against E. coli O157:H7, but none against S. aureus. Four strains had antimicrobial activity against both C. difficile and E. coli O157:H7. Of the 12 strains that had activity against C. difficile, four strains were excluded as Streptococcus species, while the other eight were identified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays using group-specific primers designed from the nucleotide sequences of the 16S rDNA and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions of the Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus species. Based on the sequencing results, the eight strains screened were identified as Bifidobacterium infantis and Lactobacillus salivarius.
TI  - Factors affecting the antibacterial effects of Nd:YAG laser in vivo.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: One of the main advantages of laser surgery is it's bactericidal effect which reduces the risk of postoperative infections. Several study designs have been set to investigate this effect. Aim of this study was to research if the bactericidal effect of laser tool was affected from several factors in vitro studies. STUDY DESIGN/MATERIALS AND METHODS: To determinate and investigate the bactericidal effect of laser in an original model, alpha-hemolytic streptococcus, Bacterioides fragilis, Neisseria, Streptococcus salivarius, Staphylococcus aureus, and Candida albicans were prepared in 10(4), 10(6) and 10(8) inoculum and placed in Mueller-Hinton Broth which have five different proportions of sheep blood. Samples which exposed with various energy levels of Nd:YAG laser were spread on agar plates, and at the end of an incubation time the colonization counted comparatively. The lowest energy level without colonization was accepted as minimal bactericidal energy level. RESULTS: Highest minimum bactericidal energy level is used for alpha-hemolytic streptococcus and lowest values for neisseria. Bactericidal effect decreased on suspensions, of which population of microorganisms are high and hemoglobin concentration was high in the broth. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the Nd:YAG laser has a higher bactericidal effect when sheep blood is added to the media. Factors like population and type of bacteria in the irradiated suspension affect minimum bactericidal energy level.
TI  - Inhibition by yeast killer toxin-like antibodies of oral Streptococci adhesion to tooth surfaces in an ex vivo model.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Monoclonal (KTmAb) and recombinant (KTscFv) anti-idiotypic antibodies, representing the internal image of a yeast killer toxin, proved to be microbicidal in vitro against important eukaryotic and prokaryotic pathogens such as Candida albicans, Pneumocystis carinii, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Staphylococcus aureus, S. haemolyticus, Enterococcus faecalis, E. faecium, and Streptococcus pneumoniae, including multidrug-resistant strains. KTmAb and KTscFv exerted a strong therapeutic effect in well-established animal models of candidiasis and pneumocystosis. Streptococcus mutans is the most important etiologic agent of dental caries that might result from the metabolic end products of dental plaque. Effective strategies to reduce the disease potential of dental plaque have considered the possibility of using antibiotics or antibodies against oral streptococci in general and S. mutans in particular. In this study, the activity of KTmAb and KTscFv against S. mutans and the inhibition and reduction by KTmAb of dental colonization by S. mutans and other oral streptococci in an ex vivo model of human teeth were investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: KTscFv and KTmAb were used in a conventional colony forming unit (CFU) assay against a serotype C strain of S. mutans, and other oral streptococci (S. intermedius, S. mitis, S. oralis, S. salivarius). An ex vivo model of human teeth submerged in saliva was used to establish KTmAb potential of inhibiting or reducing the adhesion to dental surfaces by S. mutans and other oral streptococci. RESULTS: KTmAb and KTscFv kill in vitro S. mutans and other oral streptococci. KTmAb inhibit colonization of dental surfaces by S. mutans and oral streptococci in the ex vivo model. CONCLUSIONS: Killer antibodies with antibiotic activity or their engineered derivatives may have a potential in the prevention of dental caries in vivo.
TI  - Effect of medium composition on the susceptibility of oral streptococci to mercuric chloride.
AB  - Although there is considerable interest in identifying mercury-resistant bacteria, no standardized assay exists for this purpose. In this study, the effect of the composition of the medium on the susceptibility of oral streptococci to HgCl(2) was investigated. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of HgCl(2) for 52 streptococcal strains and the reproducibility of MIC values for Hg-sensitive and Hg-resistant strains was determined with 11 different media. Addition of blood increased the MIC values, and some media (tryptone soya agar, with or without blood) could not discriminate between Hg-sensitive and Hg-resistant strains. The proportion of streptococci that appeared to be resistant to Hg was very high (>70%) on some media (mitis-salivarius, tryptone soya, Columbia), but not on others (Mueller-Hinton, Brain Heart Infusion, Isosensitest). The MICs of the control strains varied considerably on different testing occasions for tryptone soya agar (with and without blood), Isosensitest agar, and Columbia agar (with blood). Mueller-Hinton (without blood) appeared to be the most suitable medium for isolating Hg-resistant oral streptococci.
TI  - Behavior of Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus in yogurt fermented  with a bacteriocin-producing thermophilic starter.
AB  - Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus B producing a bacteriocin active against Listeria monocytogenes ATCC 7644 and Staphylococcus aureus SAD 30 was isolated from bakery yeast. The bacteriocin was partially purified by an adsorption/desorption technique, and its spectrum of action was compared to that of a neutralized cell-free supernatant (CFS). Although the CFS inhibited a number of gram-positive and -negative bacteria of health and spoilage significance, the spectrum of action of the partially purified bacteriocin was limited to gram-positive bacteria. L. monocytogenes was the most sensitive to both preparations. The bacteriocin-producing streptococcal strain was used in combination with a Bac- Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus CY strain isolated from commercial yogurt to assess the effectiveness of the resulting thermophilic starter in controlling L. monocytogenes and S. aureus in yogurt during fermentation and storage at refrigeration (ca. 7 degrees C) or abuse (ca. 22 degrees C) temperature. Yogurt samples were contaminated with L. monocytogenes or S. aureus to the approximate levels of 10(3) and 10(6) CFU/ml of milk, respectively. The results showed that in situ bacteriocin production was more active against L. monocytogenes than against S. aureus in vitro and in contaminated samples. While L. monocytogenes leveled off below the detectable limit in a 1-ml sample of yogurt within 24 h of processing, S. aureus survived in Bac+ and Bac- samples during 10 days of storage at room temperature (ca. 22 degrees C). Use of a Bac+ starter resulted in a 5-day extension of the shelf life.
TI  - Three cases of bacterial meningitis after spinal and epidural anesthesia.
AB  - During a 3-year period, three cases of bacterial meningitis developing after spinal or epidural anesthesia were observed at one hospital in Germany. The causative organisms were Streptococcus salivarius (2 cases) and Staphylococcus aureus (1 case). In the first two cases, contamination of the needle by oropharyngeal flora of the anesthesiological team was likely but remained unproven. In the third case, a nasal swab obtained from the operating anesthesiologist yielded a Staphylococcus aureus strain whose genotypic profile was identical to that of the patient's strain. Infection control procedures for spinal anesthesia are discussed.
TI  - [Effect of bioceramics on biological activity of microorganisms].
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Biomaterials that come into contact with microorganisms in the middle ear or paranasal sinuses should be tested before clinical application. Thus, it is necessary to test the influence exerted on bacterial growth by biomaterials used as bone substitutes in head and neck surgery before implantation. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this study, Bioverit, Al2O3 ceramic, and glass carbon were subjected to contamination with typical microorganisms in the middle ear and paranasal sinuses such as Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and salivarius, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis and Candida albicans. RESULTS: In the suspension test, all gram-negative species were inhibited, but gram-positive microorganisms and Candida albicans were not affected. The Al2O3 ceramic showed the largest inhibition effect while growth inhibition of glass carbon was low. Streptococcus pneumoniae and salivarius can use glass carbon as a nutrient. In contrast, Bioverit and Al2O3 ceramic could not improve the growth of all tested microorganisms. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, we think that Bioverit is suitable for implantation in bacterially contaminated regions of the head and neck, whereas glass carbon is unsuitable for this application in reconstructive surgery.
TI  - Lactic acid bacteria from healthy oral cavity of Thai volunteers: inhibition of oral pathogens.
AB  - The aims of the present study were to screen and characterize the antimicrobial lactic acid bacteria which were isolated from healthy oral cavities of Thai volunteers, and to characterize their inhibiting substances. Among 3790 isolates (suspected to be lactic acid bacteria) from 130 volunteers, five showed an appreciable effect against Sarcina lutea ATCC 9341, Bacillus cereus ATCC 11778, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, Streptococcus mutans DTMU 1, Strep. salivarius DTMU 1, Strep. sanguis DTMU 1, Candida albicans ATCC 13803 and C. albicans DTMU 2, as well as the oral pathogens. These antimicrobial isolates included L17 and N14 which showed the antibacterial activity, D14 which showed the anticandidal activity, and D6 and N8 which showed both the antibacterial and anticandidal activities. The isolates were later found to be facultative anaerobic, Gram-positive, non-spore-forming, non-capsule-forming and catalase-negative bacilli. They could utilize casein but could not hydrolyse starch, and they produced hydrogen peroxide and bacteriocins. Their antimicrobial potentials were found to be affected by pH, catalase, proteolytic enzymes and temperature. The activity was partially inactivated after catalase treatment, significantly declined at pH > or =9.0 or after trypsin and pepsin treatments, and also reduced after heating at > or =100 degrees C. However, the antimicrobial activity of these five isolates was somewhat resistant to heat. When the isolates were tested for their antimicrobial sensitivity, they were shown to be sensitive to a number of antimicrobial agents. The final identification revealed that D6, D14 and N14 were Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei, and L17 and N8 were Lact. rhamnosus.
TI  - Behavior of enterotoxigenic strains of Staphylococcus aureus in milk fermented with a yogurt starter culture.
AB  - The ability of a yogurt starter culture formed by Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp bulgaricus to inhibit the growth of four enterotoxin type A and B producers Staphylococcus aureus strains (ATCC 6538, S6, FRI-100 and a strain isolated from milk) during fermentation of milk and subsequent storage was investigated. Sterile skim milk was inoculated with about 10(6) CFU/ml of S. aureus and with about 10(6) CFU of starter culture, and incubated at 42 degrees C during 8 h, followed by refrigeration at 4 degrees C. Samples were taken every 2 h during fermentation and every 2 days during storage. Viable count of lactic acid bacteria and S. aureus as well as pH, acidity, thermostable deoxyribonuclease (TNase) and staphylococcal enterotoxin A (SEA) production were evaluated. Behavior of four strains was similar; S. aureus survived the 8 h fermentation with LAB, and its population began to decrease from the first day of storage, being completely inhibited at 9-10 days. TNase and SEA production were positive in all samples taken along the study. It was demonstrated that enterotoxigenic strains of S. aureus were able to survive the fermentation of milk with a yogurt starter culture and they were inhibited after several days during storage of the fermented product, contrary to the general belief which considered it very difficult due to the low pH. Even though S. aureus was inhibited, TNase and SEA were demonstrable along the storage. Therefore, fermented milks may play an important role in the transmission of this organism.
TI  - IB-367, a protegrin peptide with in vitro and in vivo activities against the microflora associated with oral mucositis.
AB  - Although the microflora associated with oral mucositis initiated by cytotoxic therapy is not well characterized, several studies suggest that reduction of the microbial load in the oral cavity has some clinical benefit. The MICs of IB-367, a synthetic protegrin analog, ranged from 0.13 to 64 microgram/ml for gram-positive bacteria (Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus salivarius, and Staphylococcus aureus) and from 0.06 to 8 microgram/ml for gram-negative species (Klebsiella, Escherichia, and Pseudomonas). IB-367 exhibited rapid, microbicidal activity against both log- and stationary-phase cultures of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. At concentrations near the MICs for these two organisms (4 and 2 microgram/ml, respectively), IB-367 reduced viability by more than 3 logs in less than 16 min. Similarly, IB-367 effected a 4-log reduction of the endogenous microflora in pooled human saliva within 2 min at 250 microgram/ml, a concentration readily attained by local delivery. After nine serial transfers at 0.5x the MIC, the MIC of IB-367 for MRSA and P. aeruginosa increased only two to four times. In a phase I clinical study with healthy volunteers, IB-367 was well tolerated, with no detectable systemic absorption. One hour after treatment with 9 mg of IB-367, the prevalence of gram-negative bacteria and yeast was reduced, and the density of the predominant gram-positive oral flora was decreased 1,000 times. IB-367's properties (speed of killing, breadth of spectrum, and lack of resistance) make the compound a strong candidate for the prophylaxis of oral mucositis. Phase II clinical trials with IB-367 are under way for this indication in immunocompromised subjects.
TI  - Increased interleukin-6, interferon-gamma and tumour necrosis factor-alpha production by tonsillar mononuclear cells stimulated with alpha-streptococci in patients with pustulosis palmaris et plantaris.
AB  - In vitro cytokine production by tonsillar mononuclear cells under culture conditions with or without lyophilized streptococcal antigens was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Under culture conditions without any stimulus, a certain amount of interferon (IFN)-gamma, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and interleukin (IL)-6, was detected in the supernatant culture fluids from all 29 donors tested and just detectable levels of IL-1alpha and IL-2 were identified in 5 of 12 donors tested; but IL-4 and IL-5 were not detected in any supernatants from 21 donors tested. In 16 patients with pustulosis palmaris et plantaris (PPP), all three alpha-streptococcal antigens from Streptococcus, (S.) sanguis, S. salivarius and S. mitis induced production of IL-6. IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha by tonsillar mononuclear cells at a significant level. However, no significant induction of such cytokines by alpha-streptococcal stimulus was seen in 13 donors without PPP. No significant difference in cytokine production by tonsillar mononuclear cells was seen between the PPP and non-PPP subjects, when stimulated with S. pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus Cowan I and pokeweed mitogen. In the experiments using tonsillar cell subsets, the cytokine inductions by alpha-streptococcal stimulus were found in monocyte-depleted cells as well as in purified T-cells. but not in B-cells. These data suggest that IL-6, IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha may play an important role in immunological reactions in the tonsils and that a hyper-immune response to some of alpha-streptococcal antigens through increased production of such cytokines by tonsillar mononuclear cells, to which T-cells mainly contribute, may play a key role in the pathogenesis of PPP.
TI  - Antimicrobial effects of various endodontic irrigants on selected microorganisms.
AB  - AIM: This study was undertaken to determine the antimicrobial effect of various endodontic irrigants against six selected microorganisms. METHODOLOGY: Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus salivarius, Str. pyogenes, Escherichia coli and Candida albicans were included in the study. Pre-sterilized Whatman paper discs, 6 mm in diameter and soaked with the test solution, were prepared and placed onto the previously seeded agar Petri plates. Each plate was incubated aerobically. A zone of inhibition was recorded for each plate and the results were analysed statistically. RESULTS: 5.25% NaOCl was effective against all test microorganisms with a substantial zone of inhibition. Saline was always ineffective. Decreased concentration of NaOCl significantly reduced its antimicrobial effect. Cresophene showed a significantly larger (P < 0.05) average zone of inhibition compared to the other experimental irrigants. Alcohol had smaller but not significantly different zones of inhibition than chlorhexidine. CONCLUSIONS: 5.25% NaOCl was superior in its antimicrobial abilities compared with other irrigants used. A reduced concentration of NaOCl (0.5%) resulted in significantly decreased antimicrobial effects. When compared with 21% alcohol, 0.5% NaOCl and 2% chlorhexidine, paramonochlorophenol (cresophene) showed a greater antimicrobial effect.
TI  - CtsR, a novel regulator of stress and heat shock response, controls clp and molecular chaperone gene expression in gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - clpP and clpC of Bacillus subtillis encode subunits of the Clp ATP-dependent protease and are required for stress survival, including growth at high temperature. They play essential roles in stationary phase adaptive responses such as the competence and sporulation developmental pathways, and belong to the so-called class III group of heat shock genes, whose mode of regulation is unknown and whose expression is induced by heat shock or general stress conditions. The product of ctsR, the first gene of the clpC operon, has now been shown to act as a repressor of both clpP and clpC, as well as clpE, which encodes a novel member of the Hsp100 Clp ATPase family. The CtsR protein was purified and shown to bind specifically to the promoter regions of all three clp genes. Random mutagenesis, DNasel footprinting and DNA sequence deletions and comparisons were used to define a consensus CtsR recognition sequence as a directly repeated heptad upstream from the three clp genes. This target sequence was also found upstream from clp and other heat shock genes of several Gram-positive bacteria, including Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus salivarius, S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, S. thermophilus, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Leuconostoc oenos, Lactobacillus sake, Lactococcus lactis and Clostridium acetobutylicum. CtsR homologues were also identified in several of these bacteria, indicating that heat shock regulation by CtsR is highly conserved in Gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Purification and properties of a bacteriocin of Staphylococcus epidermidis isolated from dental plaque.
AB  - An extracellular bacteriocin of Staphylococcus epidermidis isolated from dental plaque was purified and characterized. Its molecular mass was 3500 Da and pI was 10.5. This bacteriocin inhibited the growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus salivarius, and Streptococcus mitis, but Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis and other oral indigenous bacterial species examined were not inhibited. The mode of inhibition was found to be bacteriostatic.
TI  - [Aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora in chronic sinusitis in adults].
AB  - The aim of the study was to analyse microbiologically samples obtained from 30 patients aged from 21 to 73 years treated for chronic sinusitis. Aerobic bacteria only were isolated in 16 patients (53%), and anaerobic organisms only in 5 patients (17%). Mixed aerobic and anaerobic isolates were recovered from 9 patients (30%). The isolated aerobic bacteria were as follows: streptococci from the species Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus group C, Streptococcus sanguis, Staphylococcus aureus, Gram-negative rods from the genus Haemophilus and rods from the Enterobacteriaceae family, and strains of Moraxella catarrhalis. The isolated anaerobic microorganisms Gram-negative rods from the genus Prevotella, Bacteroides, Fusobacterium, Gram-positive cocci from the genus Peptostreptococcus. Other organisms from the genus Vailonella, Eubacterium and Actinomyces were isolated less frequently. In 15 patients only one isolate was recovered, in 15 patients isolated bacteria were mixed with other microorganisms.
TI  - [Serologic study in patients with streptococcal infective endocarditis].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Infective endocarditis is a systemic disease in which there are a continuously antigenic stimulation of immunologic system. Streptococcus is still the most frequent cause of infective endocarditis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We investigated the presence of antibody (AB), total and IgM by indirect immune fluorescence technique, in four groups of population: streptococcal infective endocarditis (SIE), streptococcal bacteraemia (SB), Staphylococcus aureus endocarditis, and healthy people. Antigens used were: 1) their own strain isolated from the blood of patients with SIE and SB inverted question markhomologous AB inverted question mark, and; 2) seven species of Streptococcus: Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus bovis, Streptococcus sanguis I, Streptococcus sanguis II, nutritional dependent streptococci and Enterococcus faecalis (heterologous AB). RESULTS: Homologous antibodies: titers > or = 1/512 were found in all patients with SIE and only in 2 with SB (sensitivity 100% and specificity 93%). IgM titer (threshold 1/32) was positive only in patients with SIE (sensitivity 75,5% and specificity 100%). The fall of the AB titer was continuous and slow, despite the good clinical evolution of patients. (AB titers were > or = 1/512 and IgM > or = 1/64 in 30% of patients 1 year later). Heterologous AB: in spite of statistically significant difference found in SIE versus the other groups, sensitivity of this test (threshold 1/256) is low, confidence interval include expected random value (50%), specificity is 88%. CONCLUSIONS: The utility of homologous AB for diagnosing infective endocarditis is demonstrated. On the contrary for heterologous AB, antigenic common fractions must be found in the different species.
TI  - The effect of areca nut on salivary and selected oral microorganisms.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the effect on the growth of salivary and selected oral microorganisms of areca nut, aqueous extracts of the nut, its major alkaloid arecoline and the components tannic acid and catechin of its tannin fraction. The antibacterial properties of the above were tested on Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, Candida albicans and Fusobacterium nucleatum and, as a control, Staphylococcus aureus. This was followed by investigating its effect on salivary organisms cultured from the saliva after chewing boiled areca nut. Extracts inhibited the growth of the selected organisms in a concentration dependent manner, baked and boiled nuts being significantly more potent than raw nut. Growth of C. albicans was the least affected by the nut extracts. Tannic acid was strongly antibacterial but not catechin or arecoline. No antibacterial effect could be demonstrated on salivary organisms after chewing the nut for 5 minutes but exposure of saliva to the cud for 1 hour caused a significant depression of bacterial growth. It is concluded that the hydrolysable tannins in the tannin fraction, which include tannic acid, are responsible for the antibacterial properties of the nut and that prolonged intraoral exposure to the nut can suppress bacteria in the mouth.
TI  - Salivacin 140, a novel bacteriocin from Lactobacillus salivarius subsp. salicinius T140 active against pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - Fifteen of 353 environmental isolates of lactic acid bacteria consistently showed activity against Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus mutans, Actinomyces viscosus, and/or Propionibacterium acnes. Strain T140, isolated from the surface of Japanese pampas grass leaves and identified as Lactobacillus salivarius subsp. salicinius, also had activity against several Lactobacillus species, Staphylococcus aureus and Yersinia enterocolitica. Since the antagonistic factor(s) produced by T140 was sensitive to a proteolytic enzyme, it was concluded that a bacteriocin (named salivacin 140) was involved in the inhibition activity. Strain T140 required a high initial pH (7.5-8.5) in agar plates for bacteriocin production.
TI  - Inducer expulsion and the occurrence of an HPr(Ser-P)-activated sugar-phosphate phosphatase in Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - Inducer expulsion, a phenomenon in which rapidly metabolizable sugars cause cytoplasmic dephosphorylation and efflux of pre-accumulated sugar-phosphates (sugar-P), has been documented for Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus bovis, and Lactococcus lactis, but not for other Gram-positive bacteria. Using intact cells and membrane vesicles, we show that Enterococcus faecalis exhibits both inducer exclusion and inducer expulsion, and that the latter phenomenon is dependent on the metabolite-activated ATP-dependent HPr(Ser) kinase that phosphorylates Ser-46 in HPr of the phosphotransferase system. A small, heat-stable, membrane-associated, HPr(Ser-P)-activated sugar-P phosphatase (Pase II), previously identified only in Lc. lactis, is shown to be present in extracts of Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus pyogenes but not in those of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, or Bacillis subtilis, organisms that do not exhibit the inducer expulsion phenomenon. Further, Lactobacillus brevis, an organism that exhibits inducer expulsion by a different mechanism, also apparently lacks Pase II. The results reveal that Pase II is present in those organisms that exhibit the coupled sugar-P hydrolysis/expulsion mechanism but not those that lack this mechanism. They provide correlative evidence that Pase II initiates inducer expulsion in species of enterococci, streptococci and lactococci.
TI  - Antibacterial effects of some root end filling materials.
AB  - In addition to having good sealing ability, root end filling materials should "ideally" have some antibacterial activity to prevent bacterial growth. This investigation compared the antibacterial effects of amalgam, zinc oxide-eugenol, Super EBA and a mineral trioxide aggregate on nine facultative bacteria Streptococcus fecalis, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, Lactobacillus species, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacillus subtilis, and Escherichia coli B and seven strict anaerobic bacteria, Prevotella (Bacteroides) buccae, Bacteroides fragilis, Prevotella (Bacteroides) intermedia, Prevotella (Bacteroides) melaninogenica, Fusobacterium necrophorum, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius. After growing these bacteria on solid media, freshly mixed and 24-h set test materials were placed on the surface of these inoculated media and incubated in the appropriate atmosphere for 24 to 48 h at 37 degrees C. Impregnated discs with the Super EBA liquid were used as positive controls. The antibacterial effects of each material were measured in millimeters and the data were analyzed using one-way and two-way analysis of variance and Scheffe tests to determine the statistical differences between the antibacterial effects of the test materials. Impregnated discs with Super EBA liquid caused varying degrees of growth inhibition for both facultative and strict anaerobic bacteria. Both types of amalgam had no antibacterial effect against any of the bacteria tested in this study. Mineral trioxide aggregate had an antibacterial effect on some of the facultative bacteria and no effect on any of the strict anaerobic bacteria. Zinc oxide-eugenol and Super EBA pastes had some antibacterial effects on both types of bacteria tested.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Distribution of proteins similar to IIIManH and IIIManL of the Streptococcus salivarius phosphoenolpyruvate:mannose-glucose phosphotransferase system among oral and nonoral bacteria.
AB  - In Streptococcus salivarius, the phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP):mannose-glucose phosphotransferase system, which concomitantly transports and phosphorylates mannose, glucose, fructose, and 2-deoxyglucose, is composed of the general energy-coupling proteins EI and HPr, the specific membrane-bound IIIMan, and two forms of a protein called IIIMan, with molecular weights of 38,900 (IIIManH) and 35,200 (IIIManL), that are found in the cytoplasm as well as associated with the membrane. Several lines of evidence suggest that IIIManH and/or IIIManL are involved in the control of sugar metabolism. To determine whether other bacteria possess these proteins, we tested for their presence in 28 oral streptococcus strains, 3 nonoral streptococcus strains, 2 lactococcus strains, 2 enterococcus strains, 2 bacillus strains, 1 lactobacillus strain, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli. Three approaches were used to determine whether the IIIMan proteins were present in these bacteria: (i) Western blot (immunoblot) analysis of cytoplasmic and membrane proteins, using anti-IIIManH and anti-IIIManH rabbit polyclonal antibodies; (ii) analysis of PEP-dependent phosphoproteins by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; and (iii) inhibition by anti-IIIMan antibodies of the PEP-dependent phosphorylation of 2-deoxyglucose (a mannose analog) by crude cellular extracts. Only the species S. salivarius and Streptococcus vestibularis possessed the two forms of IIIMan. Fifteen other streptococcal species possessed one protein with a molecular weight between 35,200 and 38,900 that cross-reacted with both antibodies. In the case of 9 species, a protein possessing the same electrophoretic mobility was phosphorylated at the expense of PEP. No such phosphoprotein, however, could be detected in the other six species. A III(Man)-like protein with a molecular weight of 35,500 was also detected in Lactobacillus casei by Western blot experiments as well as by PEP-dependent phosphoprotein analysis, and a protein with a molecular weight of 38,900 that cross-reacted with anti-III(Man) antibodies was detected in Lactococcus lactis. In several cases, the involvement of these putative III(Man) proteins in the PEP-dependent phosphorylation of 2-deoxyglucose was substantiated by the inhibition of phosphorylation activity of anti-III(Man) antibodies. No proteins cross-reacting with anti-III(Man) antibodies were detected in enterococci, bacilli, and E. coli. In S. aureus, a membrane protein with a molecular weight of 50,000 reacted strongly with the antibodies. This protein, however, was not phosphorylated at the expense of PEP.
TI  - Microorganisms on toothbrushes at day-care centers.
AB  - The microflora on 44 toothbrushes at 4 day-care centers in the city of Goteborg have been investigated as a presumptive risk factor for transmission of microorganisms by children. Non-supervised toothbrushing without the use of toothpaste was performed at the day-care centers twice a day. Streptococci, predominantly S. salivarius, S. sanguis, and S. mitis, were the most frequently recorded group of microorganisms and generally constituted the greatest part of the flora (on average, 50%). Beta-hemolytic streptococci were not found in any sample. Haemophilus species were noted in 82% of the samples. H. parainfluenzae being the most frequent, and H. influenzae being identified in only one sample. Anaerobes constituted on average a third of the microflora. Staphylococci were identified in 86% of the samples, S. epidermidis dominating. Fungi including molds were found in 50% of the samples, and from one day-care center large numbers of enteric organisms were identified. Thus this study shows that unsupervised toothbrushing at day-care centers can be questioned, more from a general hygienic point of view than from the risk of transmitting serious pathogens.
TI  - Low surface tension calcium hydroxide solution is an effective antiseptic.
AB  - The antimicrobial effects of a saturated calcium hydroxide solution, and in combination with 10% and 20% detergent, were evaluated on Streptococcus faecalis, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, Neisseria sp., diphtheroid, Staphylococcus aureus, Lactobacillus sp., Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacillus subtilis and Candida albicans. The saturated calcium hydroxide solution was effective against only four of the 11 microorganisms studied over a 60-min exposure time. The calcium hydroxide solutions containing detergent killed all 11 test organisms over a 30-min exposure time. This difference was statistically significant (P < 0.01). No statistically significant difference in antimicrobial action was found between the 10% and 20% detergent calcium hydroxide solutions (P > 0.01). However, the low surface tension (46.5 x 10(-3) Nm-1) and high pH (10.8) of the calcium hydroxide solution with 20% detergent establish it as the more effective solution.
TI  - Evaluation of bacterial interference and beta-lactamase production in management  of experimental infection with group A beta-hemolytic streptococci.
AB  - The in vivo effects of penicillin and cefprozil therapy on the interaction between organisms commonly recovered from inflamed tonsils were studied by using a subcutaneous abscess model in mice. These organisms were group A beta-hemolytic streptococci (GABHS), Streptococcus salivarius (which is capable of interfering with GABHS), and Staphylococcus aureus. In mice infected with GABHS and S. salivarius alone or in combination, penicillin eliminated both organisms and cefprozil eliminated GABHS and S. aureus but not S. salivarius. Penicillin did not, however, reduce the number of GABHS or S. salivarius in the presence of S. aureus. The present study demonstrated the ability of beta-lactamase-producing S. aureus to protect GABHS from penicillin. However, no such protection was present following the administration of cefprozil. Furthermore, the preservation of S. salivarius that interferes with GABHS growth may provide protection from reinfection with GABHS. This study supports and provides an explanation for the increased efficacies of cephalosporins administered orally over that of penicillin when treating patients with acute GABHS pharyngitis or tonsillitis.
TI  - Role of serum antibodies to streptococci in patients with IgA nephropathy.
AB  - Serum antibodies to whole cells of streptococci and serum immune complexes were investigated in patients with IgA nephropathy accompanied by tonsillitis and in healthy adult controls by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Serum IgA levels to Streptococcus salivarius, S. sanguis I and S. pneumoniae were higher in patients with IgA nephropathy than in healthy controls. The levels of IgG to S. pyogenes T12, S. gordonii and S. sanguis II in patients with IgA nephropathy were also higher than in healthy controls. Serum immune complexes of IgG and IgA were higher in patients with IgA nephropathy than in healthy controls. Serum levels of IgA to some strains of streptococci tended to correlate with the level of IgA immune complex in both patients and healthy controls. These results suggest that antibodies to some strains of streptococci play a role in the pathogenesis of IgA nephropathy.
TI  - [The effect of biomaterials and other industrial materials on the growth of several aerobic bacterial species in vitro].
AB  - The article deals with interactions between bio-vitro-materials and bacteria species in vitro. The growth of S. aureus, Sc. salivarius, E. coli and Ps. aeruginosa in a salt solution with and without addition of biomaterials was examined until the day 60 in a static culture. By counting the cfu/ml and determination the relative change of germ capacity the results were compared. The data of such series obtained with working materials of similar chemical composition were collected and evaluated. We found, that Ps. aeruginosa was promoted in growth by all materials, especially those, which contained carbon. The same can be said about the last materials and E. coli. In contrast as well Ca- and P-containing as--free biomaterials reduced the numbers of germs. Changes of multiplying of S. aureus and Sc. salivarius seldom were observed. It ist apparent, that the biomaterials tested are not indifferent against a few germs, which may cause infections, but they promote the growth of a few species in vitro. This may favour an infection, if such materials should be implanted. It is proposed to test biomaterials microbiologically before clinical application. Materials with indifferent behavior or low anti-microbiological effect have to be favoured.
TI  - Oral ofloxacin therapy for lower respiratory tract infection.
AB  - We made an open, noncomparative evaluation of ofloxacin, 400 mg orally bid for 10 days, in 98 subjects with community-acquired pneumonia or pathogen-confirmed bronchitis. Thirty-nine (40%) of the subjects were treated in the hospital and 59 (60%) were treated as outpatients. The mean age of those treated was 56.2 years; 73 (74%) of the subjects either were more than 60 years old or had a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or both. There were 95 organisms initially isolated in sputum, aspirate, or lavage fluid; all were susceptible to ofloxacin, and none acquired resistance during therapy. Haemophilus influenzae was the most common pathogen (19 isolates), followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae (18) and Staphylococcus aureus (10). Clinical responses included cure in 70 patients (71%), improvement in 26 (27%), and failure in two (2%). After 10 days of therapy, pathogens persisted in two cases; in one case, Streptococcus salivarius was isolated, though it remained susceptible to ofloxacin, and in the other, Klebsiella pneumoniae was accompanied by superinfection due to a resistant strain of Serratia marcescens. We included in this study three confirmed cases of atypical pneumonia successfully treated with ofloxacin, two of them due to Mycoplasma pneumonia and one to Legionella pneumophila. Ofloxacin was well tolerated. Our data indicate that ofloxacin is effective and safe as specific and empiric treatment for many lower respiratory tract infections.
TI  - Applications of BLIS typing to studies of the survival on surfaces of salivary streptococci and staphylococci.
AB  - A typing scheme based on detection of the production of bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances (BLIS) was a useful tool in a series of epidemiological studies of the spread and survival on surfaces of salivary streptococci and staphylococci. The organisms survived for longer periods on glass, plastic, stainless steel and latex surfaces than on unpainted wood or paper. The presence of saliva as a suspending medium prolonged the viability of Staphylococcus aureus C55 and Streptococcus pyogenes FF22 but not of Strep. salivarius Min 5. Young children were shown to carry Strep. salivarius of identical BLIS-types on their fingers and in their saliva. BLIS typing of Strep. salivarius strains obtained from telephone mouthpieces and from the tongue-sealed flap of envelopes was used as a method of tracing the human source of the salivary deposits.
TI  - [Maternal morbidity after abdominal cesarean section in relation to bacterial amniotic fluid colonization and premature rupture of fetal membranes].
AB  - At the time of Caesarean section, amniotic fluid was collected transabdominally from 1025 patients. In 990 patients cultures were performed on the amniotic fluid. The incidence of Caesarean section of all patients was 16.1%, the perinatal mortality in all patients 0.61%, in cases of Caesarean section 1.93%. The influence of bacterial colonisation in the amniotic cavity was analyzed with respect to premature ruptured membranes and frequency of vaginal examinations on the maternal post-operative morbidity (wound-seroma and abscess 2.4%, febrile morbidity 17%, urinary tract infection 19%). Bacterial contamination was present in 33.3% of the amniotic fluid or uterine cavity, after ruptured membranes in 44.3%, without ruptured membranes in 23.35%. There is a significant influence of the positive cultured amniotic fluid on the wound healing and on the febrile morbidity, while the urinary tract infection has been not influenced. The bacterial contamination of the amniotic fluid is correlated to the frequency of vaginal examination and the presence of ruptured membranes. The following microbiologic isolates were found in the amniotic fluids: Staphylococcus epidermidis 36.38%, Streptococcus B 12.23%, Streptococcus D 10.3%, Escherichia coli 8.42%, Staphylococcus aureus 7.88%, Peptococci 3.26%, Streptococcus salivarius 2.99%, Bacteroides 2.4%. According to these data, patients with ruptured membranes of an interval of more than 12 hrs and with more than 7 vaginal examinations could be selected for antibiotic prophylaxis to achieve a reduction in febrile morbidity and in wound infection.
TI  - A IIIman protein is involved in the transport of glucose, mannose and fructose by oral streptococci.
AB  - We show in this article that the transport of glucose, mannose and fructose by the phosphoenolpyruvate: mannose phosphotransferase system of oral streptococci requires the participation of a protein component that we have called IIIman. This protein was purified from Streptococcus salivarius by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, DEAE-TSK, hydroxyapatite, and Dyematrex Green A. The purified protein migrated as a 38,900 molecular weight protein on a sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel. However, electrophoretic analysis of phosphoproteins and Western blot experiments indicated the presence in membrane-free cellular extracts of S. salivarius of 2 different forms of IIIman having molecular weights of 38,900 and 35,200. The presence of the high-molecular-weight form of IIIman was observed by immunodiffusion, Western blot and phosphorylation by [32]PEP in S. salivarius, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, and Streptococcus lactis but not in Streptococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis and Lactobacillus casei. Antibodies directed against the IIIman of S. salivarius did not react with the IIIman of Escherichia coli.
TI  - Properties of a phosphocarrier protein (HPr) extracted from intact cells of Streptococcus sanguis.
AB  - Cells of Streptococcus sanguis strain Challis were incubated with sodium lauroylsarcosinate to extract surface proteins. A polypeptide of apparent molecular mass 16 kDa comprising about 12% of the extract was purified using anion-exchange chromatography. The polypeptide was shown to be a phosphocarrier protein (HPr) that could also be found in the soluble (cytoplasmic) fraction from cells broken by homogenization with glass beads. In vivo labelling of S. sanguis cells with 32Pi showed that the polypeptide carried a heat- and acid-stable phosphorylation and that during sucrose starvation the HPr became dephosphorylated. Antiserum raised to the S. sanguis HPr reacted on Western blots with HPrs from all oral streptococci tested, together with strains of S. pyogenes and S. salivarius, but not with HPrs from S. faecalis or S. bovis, nor with proteins from Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Actinomyces viscosus and various lactobacilli. The S. sanguis HPr had a high content of alanine (17.2%) and was similar in overall amino acid composition to the HPrs from S. mutans an S. salivarius. The N-terminal residues (to 37) of the S. sanguis HPr showed strong sequence identity (82%) with the N-terminal sequence of S. faecalis HPr. It is suggested that HPr in S. sanguis is associated closely with the cytoplasmic membrane. Non-disruptive methods of removing cell-surface proteins from streptococci effect release of HPr and possibly other cytoplasmic components.
TI  - [An in vitro evaluation of the antimicrobial effect of auxiliary agents in the instrumentation of root canals].
AB  - An in vitro evaluation of the antimicrobial effect of some substances employed during the instrumentation phase in endodontics, was performed. Agents subjected to study were: AMOSAN, RC-PREP and LARGAL ULTRA. The last two possess chelating properties. Microorganisms used were: Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus salivarius, Streptococcus salivarius, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus faecalis and Candida albicans. Evaluations were performed after 24 and 48 hours, and did not reveal any bacterial growth in any of the cultures.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of teicoplanin in an in-vitro two-compartment kinetic model.
AB  - The bactericidal activity of teicoplanin was studied in a model system in which antibiotic concentration is continuously varied. A two-compartment open model was used to reproduce, in vitro serum pharmacokinetics of teicoplanin in humans during 24 h after iv administration. Staphylococcal and streptococcal strains of various species were tested. Teicoplanin showed rapid killing of Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staph. hominis. All strains of Staph. epidermidis were rapidly killed in spite of the high MIC values (4-16 mg/l). The killing effect against Staph. haemolyticus was less rapid and marked than against Staph. epidermidis, with strain to strain variation. A 99.9% kill was achieved for most strains within 22 h, but with other isolates regrowth occurred which was due to the presence of highly resistant cells in the original population. Other staphylococci (Staph. aureus, Staph. saprophyticus) and Streptococcus pyogenes, Str. bovis and Str. salivarius were reduced by 99.9% within 22 h. Bactericidal activity against other streptococci (Str. mutans, Str. agalactiae, Str. faecalis, Str. faecium) was less marked; against Str. sanguis teicoplanin was bacteriostatic.
TI  - Treatment of bone, joint, and soft-tissue infections with oral ciprofloxacin.
AB  - We treated 52 patients with orally administered ciprofloxacin. In this study of 34 men and 18 women who completed therapy and who could be evaluated, there were 29 patients with nonhematogenous osteomyelitis, 20 patients with skin or soft-tissue infections, and 3 patients with joint infections. During the study, 92 isolates of pathogenic facultative aerobic bacteria, including 37 members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, 30 Staphylococcus aureus isolates, and 21 Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates, were recovered, and 88 (96%) of the isolates were found to be susceptible to ciprofloxacin. Of the 29 patients with osteomyelitis, 14 have not experienced relapse after a follow-up of at least 1 year. Overall, 61% of infections were resolved, as judged by both clinical and microbiological criteria, during therapy. One patient developed Streptococcus salivarius sepsis during ciprofloxacin therapy, and one patient developed a rash which required discontinuation of ciprofloxacin. Otherwise, there were no serious reactions or complications.
TI  - Coagglutination reactions between Candida albicans and oral bacteria.
AB  - An agglutination assay for detecting intermicrobial adherence between the cells of Candida albicans and various oral bacteria is described. Strains of Streptococcus sanguis, S. salivarius, S. mutans, S. mitis, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Actinomyces viscosus all coagglutinated with C. albicans. No interaction could be demonstrated between the cells of Bacteroides melaninogenicus and those of C. albicans. Preliminary investigations of these interactions suggest that binding of F. nucleatum and A. viscosus to C. albicans is mediated by bacterial proteins, possibly lectins. Other mechanisms must account for the binding of oral streptococci to C. albicans. The possible implications of these findings in relation to oral mucosal colonisation and oral candidal clearance are discussed.
TI  - Comparative adhesion of seven species of streptococci isolated from the blood of  patients with sub-acute bacterial endocarditis to fibrin-platelet clots in vitro.
AB  - The adhesion to fibrin-platelet clots in vitro of 21 strains of streptococci isolated from the blood of patients with sub-acute bacterial endocarditis (SABE) was measured. The species, in order of greatest adhesion, were Streptococcus faecalis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus milleri, Streptococcus sanguis, dextran-positive Streptococcus mitior, dextran-negative Streptococcus mitior and Streptococcus salivarius. Individual strains within species, however, cannot be assumed to be representative of their species and may exhibit unusually high or low adhesion. Adhesion depended upon both bacterial concentration and period of contact. There was no simple relationship between ability to adhere and liability to cause endocarditis. Formation of dextran did not increase adhesion. The streptococci were more adhesive than strains of Escherichia coli and Neisseria sicca and less adhesive than strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes.
TI  - Phosphoenolpyruvate-sugar phosphotransferase transport system of Streptococcus mutans: purification of HPr and enzyme I and determination of their intracellular concentrations by rocket immunoelectrophoresis.
AB  - Enzyme I and HPr, the general proteins of the phosphoenolpyruvate-sugar phosphotransferase system, play a pivotal role in the control of sugar utilization in gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. To determine whether growth conditions could modify the rate of biosynthesis of these proteins in Streptococcus mutans, we first purified to homogeneity enzyme I and HPr from S. mutans ATCC 27352. Using specific antibodies obtained against these proteins, we determined by rocket electrophoresis the intracellular levels of enzyme I and HPr in cells of S. mutans 27352 grown under various batch culture conditions and in a number of glucose-grown cells of other strains of S. mutans. HPr was purified by the procedure reported by Gauthier et al. (L. Gauthier, D. Mayrand, and C. Vadeboncoeur, J. Bacteriol. 160:755-763, 1984) and displayed a single band with a molecular weight of 6,650 when analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-urea gel electrophoresis. Enzyme I was purified by DEAE-cellulose chromatography, affinity chromatography on an anti-Streptococcus salivarius column, and preparative electrophoresis. The protein migrated as a single band in native and denaturating gel electrophoresis. The subunit molecular weight of enzyme I determined by electrophoresis under denaturating conditions was 68,000. In gel filtration chromatography at 4 degrees C, the enzyme migrated as a 135,000- to 160,000-molecular-weight species, suggesting that enzyme I is a dimer. In double immunodiffusion experiments, antibodies against HPr reacted with several oral streptococci, Streptococcus lactis, Streptococcus faecium, and Lactobacillus casei, but not with Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli. Antibodies against enzyme I of S. mutans 27352 cross-reacted with enzyme I from all the other oral streptococci tested. No cross-reaction was observed with other gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. The levels of enzyme I and HPr determined by rocket electrophoresis in S. mutans 27352 varied at the most by twofold, depending on the growth conditions. Glucose-grown cells of other S. mutans strains contained levels of enzyme I and HPr which were similar to those found in S. mutans 27352.
TI  - Assessment of head-space gas-liquid chromatography for the rapid detection of growth in blood cultures.
AB  - Blood for transfusion was inoculated with between 10(0) and 10(2) colony-forming  units (CFU) per ml of each of 59 microbial isolates and added to cooked meat broth. At intervals up to 72 h incubation, the cultures were examined by conventional visual inspection and automated head-space gas-liquid chromatography (HS-GLC). Forty-six isolates including all those examined of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, S. faecalis, S. milleri, S. mitior, S. mitis, S. salivarius, S. sanguis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Serratia sp., Enterobacter cloacae, Bacterioides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, Candida albicans, C. krusei and Torulopsis glabrata, and three isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis, were detected by HS-GLC. HS-GLC failed to detect the growth of eleven isolates including all those of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. Haemophilus influenzae, Corynebacterium sp. and two isolates of S. epidermidis. The growth of all 59 isolates were detected by visual inspection. No significant difference was found between HS-GLC analysis and visual inspection in the speed of detection of bacterial isolates. All the yeast isolates were detected by HS-GLC after 24 h incubation, indicating that it may be possible to detect fungemias earlier by HS-GLC analysis than by other methods.
TI  - Isolation of a novel protein involved in the transport of fructose by an inducible phosphoenolpyruvate fructose phosphotransferase system in Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Fructose transport in Streptococcus mutans LG-1 is mediated by at least two distinct phosphoenolpyruvate fructose phosphotransferase systems. One system is constitutive and consists of membrane components enzyme II as well as enzyme I and heat-stable protein. The other system is inducible and requires, in addition to enzyme I and heat-stable protein, a soluble substrate-specific protein for catalytic activity. This protein factor, designated IIIfru, was purified by DEAE-cellulose chromatography, hydroxylapatite chromatography, molecular sieving on Sephadex G-75, and preparative electrophoresis. The purified preparation showed only one protein band, with a molecular weight of 12,600, on sodium dodecyl sulfate-urea-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, on gel electrophoresis with the discontinuous buffer Tris-glycine, and after electrofocusing in gel (pI congruent to 3.7). The molecular weight of the native protein determined by gel filtration at 4 degrees C was 51,000. Immunodiffusion experiments performed with immunoglobulins prepared against the purified IIIfru from S. mutans LG-1 suggested that other S. mutans strains possessed a IIIfru. No precipitin bands, however, were detected with extracts from S. salivarius, S. sanguis, S. lactis, S. faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Lactobacillus casei, and Escherichia coli.
TI  - Lactose transport in Streptococcus mutans: isolation and characterization of factor IIIlac, a specific protein component of the phosphoenolpyruvate-lactose phosphotransferase system.
AB  - The transport of lactose in Streptococcus mutans is mediated via an inducible phosphoenolpyruvate-lactose phosphotransferase system. This system requires for catalytic activity a membrane fraction (enzyme II), two general proteins called enzyme I and HPr, and a soluble specific protein termed factor IIIlac. This protein factor was purified from S. mutans ATCC 27352 by chromatographies on DEAE-cellulose, hydroxylapatite, Ultrogel AcA 34, and phosphocellulose. The purified protein migrated as a single band with a molecular weight of 10,000 on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate and urea. The molecular weight calculated from the amino acid composition was 10,541. Gel filtration of the native protein gave a molecular weight of 41,500. Its isoelectric point was ca. 4.70. A specific antiserum was prepared against purified factor IIIlac. Immunodiffusion experiments revealed that only cellular extracts from lactose-grown cells contained factor IIIlac. A cross-reaction was observed with all of the S. mutans strains tested as well as with Streptococcus sanguis 10556, Streptococcus lactis 11454, and Staphylococcus aureus 6538. No precipitin band was observed with extracts of Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus faecalis, Lactobacillus casei, and Bacillus subtilis.
TI  - The oral ecology of patients with severe Sjogren's syndrome.
AB  - An investigation of the commensal microflora, salivary flow rate, pH, and the degree of atrophy of the oral mucosa in ten patients with severe Sjogren's syndrome and ten control subjects, revealed a number of differences. The numbers of Streptococcus salivarius, Neisseria pharyngis, Veillonella species and Micrococcus mucilagenosus isolated from patients with Sjogren's syndrome were significantly reduced, while the numbers of Candida spp. and Staphylococcus aureus were significantly increased when compared with control subjects. In addition the salivary pH of the Sjogren's group was significantly reduced and the degree of mucosal atrophy increased compared with controls.
TI  - Purification of proteins similar to HPr and enzyme I from the oral bacterium Streptococcus salivarius. Biochemical and immunochemical properties.
AB  - The phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS) is made of several  proteins. Two of them are designated general proteins because they are required for the transport and phosphorylation of all sugars of the PTS. These two proteins are found in the soluble fraction of cellular extracts and are termed HPr and enzyme I (EI). We reported in this work the purification and the characterization of these two proteins from Streptococcus salivarius ATCC 25975. HPr was purified by DEAE-cellulose chromatography, molecular sieving on Ultrogel AcA44, and carboxymethylcellulose chromatography. Sodium dodecyl sulfate electrophoresis in the presence of urea revealed a single band with a molecular weight of 6700. The protein contained no tryptophan and had a pI of 4.8. The purification scheme of EI was as follows: DEAE-cellulose chromatography, hydroxylapatite chromatography, DEAE-Sephadex A-50 chromatography, preparative electrophoresis, and molecular sieving on Ultrogel AcA34. The five-step purification for EI produced a 199-fold purified preparation with a specific activity of 530 mumol of HPr phosphorylated per minute per milligram of protein at 37 degrees C. The fraction obtained after filtration on Ultrogel AcA34 gave one band (68 000) on sodium dodecyl sulfate - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The molecular weight of the native enzyme determined by gel filtration at 4 degrees C was 135 000, suggesting that it was a dimer. Enzyme I had a pI of 4.2, a pH optimum of 6.7, a Km for HPr of about 27 microM, a Km for phosphoenolpyruvate of 0.48 mM, and kinetics that were consistent with a Ping-Pong mechanism. Evidence had been obtained which indicated that S. salivarius enzyme I was antigenically very similar to enzyme I from various strains of Streptococcus mutans, but not to the enzyme from Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, and Escherichia coli.
TI  - Production, purification, and properties of a bacteriocin from Staphylococcus aureus isolated from saliva.
AB  - Staphylococci from samples of human saliva were isolated on staphylococcal-selective agar plates. These strains were tested for the inhibition of the growth of Staphylococcus aureus FDA209P. The frequency of inhibitory strains among all of the staphylococcal isolates was 5.2%. Strain IYS2, which formed the biggest inhibitory zone against the growth of the indicator strain, was used as the producer of bacteriocin. IYS2 was identified to be S. aureus, based on its biological properties. The bacteriocin was purified by sequential procedures, including ammonium sulfate precipitation, fractionation with ethanol, ion-exchange chromatography, and gel filtration. Its molecular weight was determined to be 5,000. The isoelectric point was 10.0. In amino acid composition, lysine, histidine, aspartic acid, valine, and phenylalanine were predominant. The bacteriocin was heat stable but inactivated by proteases or peptidase. The bacteriocin had a bactericidal effect on susceptible cells. An analysis of the inhibitory spectrum among typical oral indigenous bacteria showed that Streptococcus salivarius, Propionibacterium acnes, Corynebacterium parvulum, and Actinomyces israelii were susceptible to the bacteriocin. Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mitis, Actinomyces viscosus, Actinomyces naeslundii, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Bacterionema matruchotii, and Bacteroides melaninogenicus were resistant. The majority of S. aureus tested were susceptible, and all Staphylococcus epidermidis strains tested were resistant.
TI  - Predominant cultivable microflora of plaque on removable dentures in patients with healthy oral mucosa.
AB  - Plaque from the fitting surface of upper full dentures in eight patients with healthy palatal mucosa was studied. To characterize the predominant cultivable flora, 916 isolates (100-128 from each sample) were subcultured from anaerobic roll-tubes. Streptococci constituted 0-81 per cent (median, 41 per cent) of the isolates with varying proportions of Streptococcus milleri, Streptoccus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus mitior and Streptococcus sanguis. Staphylococcus aureus made up 0-13 per cent (median, 6 per cent). Gram-positive rods constituted 1-74 per cent (median, 33 per cent). Among these, Actinomyces israelii, Actinomyces naeslundii, Actinomyces viscosus and Actinomyces odontolyticus were the most common species, whereas lactobacilli were isolated only from two samples, constituting 21 and 48 per cent. Among Gram-negative bacteria, only Veillonella parvula was common, constituting 3-20 per cent (median, 10 per cent). Gram-negative rods were isolated only from three samples in small proportions making up 0-6 per cent (median, 0 per cent) of the flora. Forty-seven isolates (5 per cent) were lost. Cultures for yeasts on Sabouraud agar were positive for five samples and the yeast counts corresponded to 0-0.45 per cent (median, 0.002 per cent) of the total viable counts. The microflora of denture plaque is highly variable and is to a large extent similar to that of some forms of dental plaque.
TI  - Examination of Streptococcus mutans for immunoglobulin G Fc reactivity.
AB  - Representative strains of oral streptococci were tested for Fc immunoglobulin G (IgG) reactivity by two different techniques, agglutination of rabbit-IgG sensitized sheep erythrocytes and uptake of human and rabbit 125I-radiolabeled IgG. None of the S. mutans serotypes a through e reacted with the Fc region of either human or rabbit IgG. Additionally, other streptococci such as S. sanguis, S. salivarius, S. faecalis, and S. mitis failed to show appreciable Fc reactivity as assayed by these techniques. The group A, C, and G streptococci, previously shown to possess Fc reactivity, proved to be reactive in these experiments, as did a protein A-containing strain of Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - The development of the bacterial flora in normal neonates.
AB  - The development of the bacterial flora of neonates during the first week of life  was studied in 23 babies. Specimens of meconium or faeces were collected and swabs taken from the umbilicus and mouth on days, 1, 2, 3 and 6. The bacteria present were isolated on a variety of plain and selective media. The predominant faecal organisms by the end of the first week were anaerobes. Bifidobacteria were isolated from all the neonates and bacteroides and clostridia were isolated from 78.3%. Bifidobacteria and bacteroides were present in large numbers; other species were isolated in smaller numbers. Enterococci were isolated from all neonates, enterobacteria from 82.6%, anaerobic cocci from 52.2%, and streptococci and staphylococci from 34.8% each. Staphylococcus aureus was the predominant species isolated from the umbilicus; it was isolated from 21.7% of neonates on the first day rising to 87.0% by the sixth day and represented 49% of isolates from this site. S. albus, streptococci, enterococci and Escherichia coli were each isolated from a few neonates. Viridans streptococci (31.4% of isolates) and Streptococcus salivarius (25.1%) were the commonest species recovered from the mouth. They were present from 8 h after birth; S. albus and Neisseria spp. were isolated later on the first day, and anaerobic species of Veillonella and Bifidobacterium appeared on the second day.
TI  - Binding of streptococcal antigens to muscle tissue in vitro.
AB  - Antigens extracted from cells of Streptococcus pyogenes T6 and Streptococcus mutans strains AHT, BHT, 10449, OMZ175, and K1R adsorbed to the sarcolemmal sheath of cardiac muscle cells in vitro. Similar preparations from S. salivarius, S. sanguis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Lactobacillus casei had weak or negligible tissue-binding activity. Tissue-bound bacterial antigens were detected with homologous rabbit antisera with both indirect immunofluorescence tests and an indirect radioimmunoassay. Serological cross-reactivity was observed between the tissue-binding factors of S. pyogenes and S. mutans cells but not between the bacteria and muscle tissue. In a comparative study of extraction procedures, the greatest yield of tissue-binding factors was obtained from group A streptococci by cell disruption in buffer at 4 degrees C. Hot aqueous phenol and hot water extracts were inactive. Antibodies specific for the tissue-binding factor(s) were readily adsorbed from rabbit anti-S. pyogenes serum by a preparation of isolated cytoplasmic membranes but not by a suspension of cell wall fragments. The heart-binding component of S. pyogenes cell extracts was inactivated by protease digestion and heat treatment and to a lesser extent by periodic acid oxidation. The capacity of heart cell components to adsorb streptococcal antigens was reduced by protease treatment but not by the action of neuraminidase, hyaluronidase, organic solvents, or detergents.
TI  - New method for the isolation of Streptococcus mutans and its differentiation from other oral streptococci.
AB  - A new, improved agar medium for the isolation of Streptococcus mutans, the etiological agent of dental caries, was developed. In contrast to mitis-salivarius agar, this medium not only recovers a greater number of S. mutans strains from most oral specimens but, because of its mannitol and sorbitol content, it also facilitates the differentiation of S. mutans from other oral streptococci, e.g., S. salivarius, S. mitis, and S. sanguis, which do not grow or produce scanty growth only after 10 days of incubation. The medium is easy to prepare because of its simple and unique composition, is characterized by the presence of an acid indicator, and can be utilized under aerobic and anaerobic conditions as well. The medium cannot be used to distinguish among the eight serotypes, a to g and SL-1, of S. mutans. Mannitol-utilizing bacteria such as streptococci (e.g., S. faecalis) and other microorganisms (e.g., Staphylococcus aureus) are able to grow on this medium and can be distinguished from S. mutans by their unique colony morphology.
TI  - Arthritogenicity in rats of cell walls from several streptococci staphylococci and two other bacteria.
AB  - Bacterial cell walls from Str. bovis, Str. lactis, Str. mutans, Str. thermophilus, Str. salivarius, and Str. pyogenes were able to produce polyarthritis in rats but Str. faecalis cell walls were nonarthritogenic. S. aureus cell walls produced extremely severe disease. It was also shown that cell walls from S. epidermidis, B. megaterium, and M. lysodeikticus were nonarthritogenic. A close correlation was observed between development of arthritis and the delayed hypersensitivity to bacterial peptidoglycans but not with the PPD hypersensitivity. It was suggested that the adjuvanticity of bacterial cell walls is needed to induce the disease and that arthritogenicity requires a specific antigen in addition to the presence of an adjuvant-inducing agent.
TI  - [Nasopharyngeal microorganisms--antagonists of meningococci].
AB  - A study was made of the species composition of symbiotic microbial flora of the nasopharynx in healthy persons and meningococcus carriers, inhibiting in vitro the growth of the test strains of miningococci. Saprophytic streptococci and particularly Str. salivarius served as the principal and the most active antagonists of meningococci in both groups of the persons examined. Comparison of the inhibitory activity of antagonists in the groups examined revealed no significant differences. However, there were seen differences in the quantitative composition of the isolated antagonists: saprophytic streptococci, particularly Str. salivarius were isolated in great amounts, and more frequently from healthy individuals, and nondifferentiated Gram positive cocci of conditionally distinguished group--from carriers. Taking into consideration the high inhibitory activity of Str. salivarius it is supposed that it can be used as an indicator of the state of insensitiveness of the human organism to the meningococcus infection.
TI  - Immunoadjuvant activities of cell walls and their water-soluble fractions prepared from various gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The cell walls from all 21 species of gram-positive bacteria examined, except lysozyme-susceptible Micrococcus lysodeikticus (NCTC 2665) and lysozyme-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (ATCC 155), were found to be definitely adjuvant-active in both stimulation of increased serum antibody levels and induction of delayed-type hypersensitivity to ovalbumin when administered to guinea-pigs as water-in-oil emulsions. Using various cell wall lytic enzymes, the immunoadjuvant principles were solubilized with full retention of the adjuvant activities from walls of Staphylococcus aureus (Copenhagen), Streptococcus pyogens (group A, type 6; S43/100), Streptococcus salivarius (IFO 3350), Streptococcus faecalis (IFO 12580), Streptococcus mutans (BHT), Lactobacillus plantarum (ATCC 8014), Bacillus megaterium (IFO 12068), Corynebacterium diphtheriae (Park-Williams No. 8), Mycobacterium smegmatis, and Actinomyces viscous (ATCC 15987). Evidence was obtained that the non-peptidoglycan portion of the cell walls is not essential for manifestation of immunoadjuvancy.
TI  - Fine structure and distribution of extracellular polymer surrounding selected aerobic bacteria.
AB  - The structure and distribution of extracellular polymer surrounding Bacillus circulans, Diplococcus (Streptococcus) pneumoniae, Streptococcus salivarius, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Herella vaginacola (Acinetobacter calcoaceticus), and Agrobacterium tumefaciens were studied by electron microscopy. A modified ruthenium red staining procedure was used to examine the fine structure of capsule and slime. Freeze-etching and critical-point drying were used to examine the quantity of unaltered exocellular material. Comparative data demonstrate that fibrillar extracellular polymer surrounding B. circulans, D. pneumoniae, and K. pneumoniae is capsule (cell wall attached) which is characteristic of the producing organism. Capsular polymer generally appeared fibrillar, although globular polymer consisted of capsular subunits bound to S. salivarius and H. vaginacola. Exocellular slime was present about S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, and A. tumefaciens.
TI  - Serum Bacteriostasis of Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Serum bacteriostasis of Staphylococcus aureus was characterized quantitatively and quantitatively. Bacteriostasis was proportional to the concentration of serum. Reproducibility was good; freezing and thawing did not materially affect the end point. Four of six different strains, including the propagating S. aureus strain for phage 73 which does not produce coagulase, were susceptible to serum bacteriostasis in similar titers; two were not susceptible at all. All six strains were effective inhibitors of bacteriostasis. Active and inactive coagulase were also inhibitors. In contrast to sensitive S. aureus, S. epidermidis and Streptococcus salivarius were not uniformly susceptible to bacteriostasis by different serums. Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella montevideo, S. zymogenes, and Diplococcus pneumoniae were not susceptible. Among gram-positive bacteria, only D. pneumoniae inhibited S. aureus bacteriostasis. Agglutinins of S. aureus and nonspecific substances such as lysozyme, beta-lysin, C-reactive protein, and transferrin were not responsible for S. aureus serum bacteriostasis. After diethylaminoethyl column fractionation of serum, the bacteriostatic principle was eluted in proximity to blood group antibody; immunoglobulins A, G, and M appeared to be present in bacteriostatic fractions. It is suggested that S. aureus bacteriostasis by serum is due to natural antibody and that inhibitory reactions with pneumococci and coagulase are due to common antigens.
