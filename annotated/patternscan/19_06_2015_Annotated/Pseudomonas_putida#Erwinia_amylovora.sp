TI  == bacterial species specificity in prou osmoinducibility and nptii and lacz expression.
AB  == reporter gene-based transcriptional fusions are increasingly being used to address questions in microbial ecology, with constitutively expressed fusions enabling microbe tracking and inducible fusions reporting the presence of environmental signals. to more readily apply this technology to a variety of bacterial species, we examined species specificity in the expression of three promoters of interest. a comparison of two potentially constitutive promoters, each fused to the reporter gene gfp, showed that the nptii promoter (p(nptii)) was expressed in a broader range of species (100% of 11 tested) than the lacz promoter (p(lacz)) (75% of 11 tested), and thus has broader applicability for marking bacteria than p(lacz). for the species that expressed p(lacz), however,p(lacz) was expressed 3-fold more than p(nptii), on average. the escherichia coli prou promoter, which is induced by low water potential in e. coli, salmonella typhimurium, pantoea agglomerans, and pseudomonas syringae, was  shown to be similarly responsive to water potential in strains of clavibacter michiganensis, enterobacter aerogenes, pseudomonas fluorescens, pseudomonas putida, and sinorhizobium meliloti, as well as mildly osmoresponsive in agrobacterium tumefaciens, supporting its broad use as a reporter of water potential. surprisingly, this promoter was not regulated by water potential in strains of staphylococcus aureus and erwinia amylovora, illustrating heretofore unrecognized species specificity in prou inducibility, as well as potential limitations in the species that can serve as bioreporters of water potential.

TI  == the gut of the soil microarthropod folsomia candida (collembola) is a frequently  changeable but selective habitat and a vector for microorganisms.
AB  == interaction potentials between soil microarthropods and microorganisms were investigated with folsomia candida (insecta, collembola) in microcosm laboratory  experiments. microscopic analysis revealed that the volumes of the simple, rod-shaped guts of adult specimens varied with their feeding activity, from 0.7 to 11.2 nl. a dense layer of bacterial cells, associated with the peritrophic membrane, was detected in the midgut by scanning electron microscopy. depending on the molting stage, which occurred at intervals of approximately 4 days, numbers of heterotrophic, aerobic gut bacteria changed from 4.9 x 10(2) to 2.3 x  10(6) cfu per specimen. a total of 11 different taxonomic bacterial groups and the filamentous fungus acremonium charticola were isolated from the guts of five  f. candida specimens. the most abundant isolate was related to erwinia amylovora  (96.2% dna sequence similarity to its 16s rrna gene). f. candida preferred to feed on pseudomonas putida and three indigenous gut isolates rather than eight different type culture strains. when luciferase reporter gene-tagged bacterial strains were pulse fed to f. candida, gut isolates were continuously shed for 8 days to several weeks but escherichia coli hb101 was shed for only 1 day. ratios  of ingested to released bacterial cells demonstrated that populations of nonindigenous gut bacteria like sinorhizobium meliloti l33 and e. coli hb101 were reduced by more than 4 orders of magnitude but that the population of gut isolate alcaligenes faecalis hr4 was reduced only 500-fold. this work demonstrates that f. candida represents a frequently changeable but selective habitat for bacteria  in terrestrial environments and that microarthropods have to be considered factors that modify soil microbial communities.
