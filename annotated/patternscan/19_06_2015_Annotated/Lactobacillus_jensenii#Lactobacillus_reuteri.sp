TI  == identification of culturable vaginal lactobacillus species among reproductive age women in mysore, india.
AB  == a healthy vaginal environment is predominated by certain lactobacillus species, which lead to the prevention of infections of the reproductive tract. this study  examined the characteristics of cultivable lactobacillus species between healthy  women and women with bacterial vaginosis (bv). between november 2011 and sept 2013, 139 women attending a women's clinic in mysore, india were diagnosed for bv in a cross-sectional study. bv was diagnosed using amsel's criteria: homogeneous  vaginal discharge, vaginal ph > 4.5, production of amines, and presence of 'clue' cells. those with three or more of the characteristics were considered to have bv. vaginal swabs were then cultured in rogosa agar, de man-rogosa-sharpe broth.  gram-positive lactobacilli generating 600- 800bp amplicon by16 srna were further  characterized by sequencing. cultivable vaginal samples were obtained from 132 (94.9%) women. according to amsel criteria, 83(62.1%) women were healthy and 49(37.1%) women had bv. eleven different lactobacillus species were isolated from 47 women. the common lactobacilli species found in this sample included l. crispatus (39.6%), l. gasseri (45.8%), and l. jensenii (14.6%). lactobacilli were isolated from 39 healthy and 8 women with bv. l. gasseri was cultured from 18.8%  of healthy and 6.1% of women with bv. the presence of l. reuteri was significantly associated with normal vaginal microbiota (p-value = 0.026). these  results further our understanding of vaginal lactobacilli colonisation and richness in this particular population. our findings showed lactobacilli species  present in healthy vagina of women in india do not differ from those reported from other countries.

TI  == characterization of culturable vaginal lactobacillus species among women with and without bacterial vaginosis from the united states and india: a cross-sectional study.
AB  == lactobacillus species play an integral part in the health of the vaginal microbiota. we compared vaginal lactobacillus species in women from india and the usa with and without bacterial vaginosis (bv). between july 2009 and november 2010, a cross-sectional study was conducted among 40 women attending a women's health clinic in mysore, india, and a sexually transmitted diseases clinic in san francisco, usa. women were diagnosed with bv using amsel's criteria and the nugent score. lactobacillus 16s rdna was sequenced to speciate the cultured isolates. ten indian and 10 us women without bv were compared with an equal number of women with bv. lactobacilli were isolated from all healthy women, but from only 10% of indian and 50% of us women with bv. 16s rdna from 164 lactobacillus colonies was sequenced from healthy women (126 colonies) and women  with bv (38 colonies). seven cultivable lactobacillus species were isolated from  11 indian women and nine species from 15 us women. the majority of lactobacillus  species among indian women were l. crispatus (25.0%), l. jensenii (25.0%) and l.  reuteri (16.7%). among us women, l. crispatus (32.0%), l. jensenii (20.0%) and l. coleohominis (12.0%) predominated. l. jensenii and l. crispatus dominated the vaginal flora of healthy indian and us women. indian women appeared to have a higher percentage of obligate heterofermentative species, suggesting the need for a larger degree of metabolic flexibility and a more challenging vaginal environment.

TI  == lactobacillus species isolated from vaginal secretions of healthy and bacterial vaginosis-intermediate mexican women: a prospective study.
AB  == background: lactobacillus jensenii, l. iners, l. crispatus and l. gasseri are the most frequently occurring lactobacilli in the vagina. however, the native species vary widely according to the studied population. the present study was performed  to genetically determine the identity of lactobacillus strains present in the vaginal discharge of healthy and bacterial vaginosis (bv) intermediate mexican women. methods: in a prospective study, 31 strains preliminarily identified as lactobacillus species were isolated from 21 samples collected from 105 non-pregnant mexican women. the samples were classified into groups according to  the nugent score criteria proposed for detection of bv: normal (n), intermediate  (i) and bacterial vaginosis (bv). we examined the isolates using culture-based methods as well as molecular analysis of the v1-v3 regions of the 16s rrna gene.  enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (eric) sequence analysis was performed to reject clones. results: clinical isolates (25/31) were classified into four groups based on sequencing and analysis of the 16s rrna gene: l. acidophilus (14/25), l. reuteri (6/25), l. casei (4/25) and l. buchneri (1/25). the remaining six isolates were presumptively identified as enterococcus species. within the l. acidophilus group, l. gasseri was the most frequently isolated species, followed by l. jensenii and l. crispatus. l. fermentum, l. rhamnosus and l. brevis were also isolated, and were placed in the l. reuteri, l. casei and l.  buchneri groups, respectively. eric profile analysis showed intraspecific variability amongst the l. gasseri and l. fermentum species. conclusions: these findings agree with previous studies showing that l. crispatus, l. gasseri and l. jensenii are consistently present in the healthy vaginal ecosystem. additional species or phylotypes were detected in the vaginal microbiota of the non-pregnant mexican (hispanic-mestizo) population, and thus, these results further our understanding of vaginal lactobacilli colonisation and richness in this particular population.

TI  == adhesion forces and coaggregation between vaginal staphylococci and lactobacilli.
AB  == urogenital infections are the most common ailments afflicting women. they are treated with dated antimicrobials whose efficacy is diminishing. the process of infection involves pathogen adhesion and displacement of indigenous lactobacillus crispatus and lactobacillus jensenii. an alternative therapeutic approach to antimicrobial therapy is to reestablish lactobacilli in this microbiome through probiotic administration. we hypothesized that lactobacilli displaying strong adhesion forces with pathogens would facilitate coaggregation between the two strains, ultimately explaining the elimination of pathogens seen in vivo. using atomic force microscopy, we found that adhesion forces between lactobacilli and three virulent toxic shock syndrome toxin 1-producing staphylococcus aureus strains, were significantly stronger (2.2-6.4 nn) than between staphylococcal pairs (2.2-3.4 nn), especially for the probiotic lactobacillus reuteri rc-14 (4.0-6.4 nn) after 120 s of bond-strengthening. moreover, stronger adhesion forces resulted in significantly larger coaggregates. adhesion between the bacteria occurred instantly upon contact and matured within one to two minutes, demonstrating the potential for rapid anti-pathogen effects using a probiotic. coaggregation is one of the recognized mechanisms through which lactobacilli can  exert their probiotic effects to create a hostile micro-environment around a pathogen. with antimicrobial options fading, it therewith becomes increasingly important to identify lactobacilli that bind strongly with pathogens.

TI  == qualitative and semiquantitative analysis of lactobacillus species in the vaginas of healthy fertile and postmenopausal chinese women.
AB  == the present study aimed to investigate the prevalence and quantity of lactobacillus species in the vaginas of healthy chinese women. vaginal samples from 92 fertile and 22 postmenopausal healthy chinese women were analysed using a 16s rrna gene clone library and species-specific pcr followed by sequencing and real-time pcr. a total of 13 different lactobacillus species were detected. species-specific pcr showed that 3% of the fertile women were colonized by one species of lactobacillus and 97% were colonized by two or more species. among the postmenopausal women, 91% were colonized by one species of lactobacillus and 9% were colonized by two species. in the fertile women, l. iners (82.61%), l. crispatus (70.65%) and l. gasseri (67.39%) were more prevalent than l. jensenii (40.22%), l. acidophilus (39.13%), l. brevis (23.91%), l. plantarum (5.43%), l. johnsonii (3.26%), l. fermentum (2.17%), l. salivarius (2.17%), l. rhamnosus (1.09%), l. reuteri (1.09%) and l. paracasei (1.09%); l. delbrueckii was not detected. in the postmenopausal women, l. fermentum, l. rhamnosus, l. reuteri and l. delbrueckii were not detected, and the other 10 species were detected in just  a few samples. the prevalence of these species according to the clone library differed from the prevalence indicated by the species-specific pcr. according to  the semiquantitative analysis, the total lactobacillus dna concentrations were higher in fertile women than in postmenopausal women. sixty-one per cent of the fertile women were predominantly colonized by l. iners, 35% by l. crispatus, and  2% by l. gasseri. associations between pairs of lactobacillus species in fertile  women were significant (p<0.05) between the following pairs: l. iners and l. gasseri, l. iners and l. jensenii, l. iners and l. acidophilus, l. gasseri and l. acidophilus, and l. gasseri and l. jensenii. in conclusion, this study provided detailed information on lactobacillus species colonizing the vaginas of healthy chinese fertile and postmenopausal women. the study also showed that the diversity of lactobacillus species in fertile women was higher than in postmenopausal women. according to our study, different techniques, such as species-specific pcr and comparison against a 16s rrna gene clone library, resulted in different findings regarding species prevalence. these findings highlight the importance of standardization of techniques used for evaluation of  bacterial communities. according to our findings regarding species associations,  l. iners and l. gasseri may have influences on colonization and proliferation of  other vaginal lactobacillus species.

TI  == lactobacillus species shift in distal esophagus of high-fat-diet-fed rats.
AB  == aim: to analyze the microbiota shift in the distal esophagus of sprague-dawley rats fed a high-fat diet. methods: twenty sprague-dawley rats were divided into high-fat diet and normal control groups of 10 rats each. the composition of microbiota in the mucosa from the distal esophagus was analyzed based on selective culture. a variety of lactobacillus species were identified by molecular biological techniques. bacterial dna from lactobacillus colonies was extracted, and 16s rdna was amplified by pcr using bacterial universal primers. the amplified 16s rdna products were separated by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). every single band was purified from the gel and sent to be sequenced. results: based on mucosal bacterial culturing in the distal esophagus, staphylococcus aureus was absent, and total anaerobes and lactobacillus species were decreased significantly in the high-fat diet group compared with the normal control group (p < 0.01). detailed dgge analysis on the  composition of lactobacillus species in the distal esophagus revealed that lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus gasseri (l. gasseri) and lactobacillus reuteri (l. reuteri) comprised the lactobacillus species in the high-fat diet group, while the composition of lactobacillus species in the normal control group consisted of l. gasseri, lactobacillus jensenii and l. reuteri. conclusion: high-fat diet led to a mucosal microflora shift in the distal esophagus in rats,  especially the composition of lactobacillus species.

TI  == an in vitro study on bacterial growth interactions and intestinal epithelial cell adhesion characteristics of probiotic combinations.
AB  == the aims of this study were to examine long-term growth interactions of five probiotic strains (lactobacillus casei 01, lactobacillus plantarum ha8, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactobacillus reuteri atcc 55730 and bifidobacterium  lactis bb12) either alone or in combination with propionibacterium jensenii 702 in a co-culture system and to determine their adhesion ability to human colon adenocarcinoma cell line caco-2. growth patterns of probiotic lactobacillus strains were not considerably affected by the presence of p. jensenii 702, whereas lactobacilli exerted a strong antagonistic action against p. jensenii 702. in the co-culture of bif. lactis bb12 and p. jensenii 702, a significant synergistic influence on growth of both bacteria was observed (p < 0.05). the results of adhesion assay showed that when probiotic strains were tested in combination, there was evidence of an associated effect on percentage adherence.  however, in most cases these differences were not statistically significant (p <  0.05). adhesion percentage of lb. casei 01 and lb. rhamnosus gg both decreased significantly in the presence of p. jensenii 702 compared to their adhesion levels when alone (p < 0.05). these results show that the survival and percentage adhesion of some probiotic strains may be influenced by the presence of other strains and this should be considered when formulating in the probiotic products.

TI  == changes in the predominant human lactobacillus flora during in vitro fertilisation.
AB  == background: signature matching of nucleotide sequences in the v1 and v3 regions 16s rrna genes using pyrosequencing technology is a powerful tool for typing vaginal lactobacilli to the species level and has been used for investigating the vaginal microbial niche. methods: this study has characterized the normal cultivable vaginal lactobacillus flora at varying estradiol levels in plasma; the study comprised 17 patients undergoing ovarian stimulation for in vitro fertilization (ivf) treatment. the vaginal status of each participant was initially assessed as normal according to amsel and nugent criteria. results: l.  crispatus, l. gasseri and/or l. jensenii were present in 10 of the patients throughout the study period, and little variation among these three species was encountered in individual patients. the flora of three women was dominated by l.  delbrueckii, l. rhamnosus or l. vaginalis. one woman exhibited a dominance of l.  iners. the flora of the remaining three women were initially dominated by l. rhamnosus or l. reuteri, but as their estrogen levels rose, their flora composition altered, to become dominated by one of the three species most common  in a normal, healthy vagina. conclusion: signature matching of nucleotide sequences in the v1 and v3 regions of 16s rrna genes is a discriminative tool for the study of vaginal lactobacilli and can be used to track the lactobacillus flora under a variety of physiological conditions.

TI  == the effect of probiotics and organic acids on shiga-toxin 2 gene expression in enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli o157:h7.
AB  == probiotics are known to have an inhibitory effect against the growth of various foodborne pathogens, however, the specific role of probiotics in shiga-toxin-producing escherichia coli (stec) virulence gene expression has not been well defined. shiga toxins are members of a family of highly potent bacterial toxins and are the main virulence marker for stec. shiga toxins inhibit protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells and play a role in hemorrhagic colitis and  hemolytic uremic syndrome. stec possesses shiga toxin 1 (stx1) and shiga toxin 2  (stx2), both of which have a and b subunits. although stec containing both stx1 and stx2 has been isolated from patients with hemorrhagic colitis, stx2 is more frequently associated with human disease complications. thus, the effect of lactobacillus, pediococcus, and bifidobacterium strains on stx2a expression levels in stec was investigated. lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria were isolated from farm animals, dairy, and human sources and included l. rhamnosus gg, l. curvatus, l. plantarum, l. jensenii, l. acidophilus, l. casei, l. reuteri, p. acidilactici, p. cerevisiae, p. pentosaceus, b. thermophilum, b. boum, b. suis and b. animalis. e. coli o157:h7 (edl 933) was coincubated with sub-lethal concentrations of each probiotic strain. following rna extraction and cdna synthesis, relative stx2a mrna levels were determined according to a comparative  critical threshold (ct) real-time pcr. data were normalized to the endogenous control glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh) and the level of stx2a expression between treated and untreated stec was compared. observed for all probiotic strains tested, stx2a was down-regulated, when compared to the control  culture. probiotic production of organic acids, as demonstrated by a decrease in  ph, influenced stx2a gene expression.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of intraurethrally administered probiotic lactobacillus casei in a murine model of escherichia coli urinary tract infection.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of the intraurethrally administered probiotic lactobacillus casei strain shirota against escherichia coli in a murine urinary tract infection (uti) model was examined. uti was induced by intraurethral administration of escherichia coli strain hu-1 (a clinical isolate from a uti patient, positive for type 1 and p fimbriae), at a dose of 1 x 10(6) to 2 x 10(6) cfu in 20 microl of saline, into a c3h/hen mouse bladder which had been traumatized with 0.1 n hcl followed immediately by neutralization with 0.1 n naoh 24 h before the challenge infection. chronic infection with the pathogen at 10(6) cfu in the urinary tract (bladder and kidneys) was maintained for more than 3 weeks after the challenge, and the number of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and myeloperoxidase activity in the urine were markedly elevated during the infection period. a single administration of l. casei shirota at a dose of 10(8) cfu 24 h before the challenge infection dramatically inhibited e. coli growth and inflammatory responses in the urinary tract. multiple daily treatments with l. casei shirota during the postinfection period also showed antimicrobial activity  in this uti model. a heat-killed preparation of l. casei shirota exerted significant antimicrobial effects not only with a single pretreatment (100 microg/mouse) but also with multiple daily treatments during the postinfection period. the other lactobacillus strains tested, i.e., l. fermentum atcc 14931(t), l. jensenii atcc 25258(t), l. plantarum atcc 14917(t), and l. reuteri jcm 1112(t), had no significant antimicrobial activity. taken together, these results suggest that the probiotic l. casei strain shirota is a potent therapeutic agent  for uti.

TI  == rapid identification of 11 human intestinal lactobacillus species by multiplex pcr assays using group- and species-specific primers derived from the 16s-23s rrna intergenic spacer region and its flanking 23s rrna.
AB  == rapid and reliable two-step multiplex polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assays were established to identify human intestinal lactobacilli; a multiplex pcr was used for grouping of lactobacilli with a mixture of group-specific primers followed by four multiplex pcr assays with four sorts of species-specific primer mixtures for identification at the species level. primers used were designed from nucleotide sequences of the 16s-23s rrna intergenic spacer region and its flanking 23s rrna  gene of members of the genus lactobacillus which are commonly isolated from human stool specimens: lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus delbrueckii (ssp. bulgaricus and ssp. lactis), lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus jensenii, lactobacillus paracasei (ssp. paracasei and ssp. tolerans), lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus rhamnosus and lactobacillus salivarius (ssp. salicinius and ssp. salivarius). the established two-step multiplex pcr assays were applied  to the identification of 84 lactobacillus strains isolated from human stool specimens and the pcr results were consistent with the results from the dna-dna hybridization assay. these results suggest that the multiplex pcr system established in this study is a simple, rapid and reliable method for the identification of common lactobacillus isolates from human stool samples.

TI  == the identification of vaginal lactobacillus species and the demographic and microbiologic characteristics of women colonized by these species.
AB  == lactobacillus acidophilus has been reported to be the predominant vaginal species. vaginal lactobacilli isolated from 215 sexually active women were identified using whole-chromosomal dna probes to 20 american type culture collection lactobacillus strains. most women were colonized by l. crispatus (32%), followed by l. jensenii (23%), a previously undescribed species designated l. 1086v (15%), l. gasseri (5%), l. fermentum (0.3%), l. oris (0.3%), l. reuteri  (0.3%), l. ruminis (0.3%), and l. vaginalis (0.3%). h2o2 was produced by 95% of l. crispatus and 94% of l. jensenii isolates, compared with only 9% of l. 1086v.  colonization by l. crispatus or l. jensenii was positively associated with being  white (p<.001), age >/=20 years (p=.05), barrier contraceptive usage (p=.008), and lower frequency of bacterial vaginosis (p<.001) and gonorrhea (p=.03). l. crispatus and l. jensenii, not l. acidophilus, are the most common species of vaginal lactobacilli.

TI  == electrophoretic pattern of peptidoglycan hydrolases, a new tool for bacterial species identification: application to 10 lactobacillus species.
AB  == lactobacilli have been used as industrial starters for a long time, but in many cases their phenotypic identification is still neither easy nor reliable. previously we observed that the cell wall peptidoglycan hydrolases of lactobacillus helveticus were highly conserved enzymes; the aim of the present work was to determine whether peptidoglycan hydrolase patterns obtained by renaturing sds-page could be of interest in the identification of lactobacilli species. for that purpose, the peptidoglycan hydrolase patterns of 94 strains of  lactobacilli belonging to 10 different species were determined; most of the species studied are used either in dairy, meat, bakery or vegetable fermentations: l. helveticus, l. acidophilus, l. delbrueckii, l. brevis, l. fermentum, l. jensenii, l. plantarum, l. sake, l. curvatus and l. reuteri. within a species, the strains exhibited highly similar patterns: the apparent molecular  weights of the lytic bands were identical, with only slight variations of intensity. moreover, each species, including phylogenetically close species such  as l. sake and l. curvatus, or l. acidophilus and l. helveticus, gave a different pattern. interestingly, the closer the species were phylogenetically, the more related were their patterns. the sensitivity of the method was checked using various quantities of l. acidophilus cells: a peptidoglycan hydrolase extract of  5 x 10(6) cells was sufficient to obtain an informative pattern, as was a single  colony. finally, the method was also successfully applied to distinguish two carnobacterium species. in conclusion, the electrophoretic pattern of peptidoglycan hydrolases is proposed as a new tool for lactobacilli identification: it is rapid, sensitive and effective even for phylogenetically close species. furthermore, this work provides the first evidence of the potential overall taxonomic value of bacterial peptidoglycan hydrolases.

TI  == [a microflora study of the gastrointestinal tract of mink housed within and outside of the area of the chernobyl atomic electric power station].
AB  == quantitative differences in the content of lactic acid bacteria isolated from the content of the stomach, small and large intestine have been established when studying microflora of the gastrointestinal tract of minks kept in the 30-kilometer zone of the chernobyl npp (experimental animals) and at the cherkassy fur farm (control animals). obligate heterofermentative species of lactic acid bacteria related to lactobacillus fermentum and l. reuteri prevailed  in the stomach of experimental minks. species composition of lactic acid bacteria isolated from the stomach of the cherkassy minks is characterized by the availability of both obligate and facultative heterofermentative species of bacteria--l. bavaricus, l. coryniformis, l. reuteri and of obligate homofermentative bacteria--l. salivarius and l. jensenii. in limiting dilutions (10(-9)-10(-10)) of the content of small intestine of the control minks one could find bacteria of l. coryniformis species and representatives of obligate heterofermentative bacteria--l. confusus and l. fermentum that is 1-2 orders higher then in the experimental minks. both lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria (the latter up to 10(+9) cells/g of the content) were isolated from the lower departments of small and large intestine of the chernobyl and cherkassy minks. among the species of lactic acid bacteria isolated from the experimental animals homofermentative species (l. acidophilus, l. sharpeae) and,  heterofermentative (l. confusus, l. fermentum) in the control were found.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == systematics of the lactobacillus population on rat intestinal mucosa with special reference to lactobacillus reuteri.
AB  == the systematics of the lactobacillus population of the intestines of 88 different rats was studied; 80 rats had been fed on fermented oat-meal soup (molin et al. 1992). one-hundred-twenty-two lactobacillus strains from the intestinal mucosa were phenotypically classified together with twenty-eight reference strains of lactobacillus and leuconostoc, using 49 unit characters. data were examined using jaccard coefficient, and unweighted pair group algorithm with arithmetic averages. two major and eleven minor clusters were defined at the 76% sj-similarity level: cluster 1 included thirty isolates which could not be identified further, but had resemblance to the type strains of l. jensenii, l. gasseri, l. crispatus, and to some extent to l. acidophilus. cluster 12 including fifty-four intestinal isolates was identified as l. reuteri; and so was cluster 13 (five isolates). isolates of the major clusters were found in all parts of the intestines. the genomic homogeneity of the l. reuteri isolates was scrutinized by endonuclease restriction analysis of the chromosomal dna, and the isolates could  be divided into six genomic strains.

TI  == production of succinic acid from citric acid and related acids by lactobacillus strains.
AB  == a number of lactobacillus strains produced succinic acid in de man-rogosa-sharpe  broth to various extents. among 86 fresh isolates from fermented cane molasses in thailand, 30 strains (35%) produced succinic acid; namely, 23 of 39 lactobacillus reuteri strains, 6 of 18 l. cellobiosus strains, and 1 of 6 unidentified strains. all of 10 l. casei subsp. casei strains, 5 l. casei subsp. rhamnosus strains, 6 l. mali strains, and 2 l. buchneri strains did not produce succinic acid. among 58 known strains including 48 type strains of different lactobacillus species, the strains of l. acidophilus, l. crispatus, l. jensenii, and l. parvus produced  succinic acid to the same extent as the most active fresh isolates, and those of  l. alimentarius, l. collinoides, l. farciminis, l. fructivorans (1 of 2 strains tested), l. malefermentans, and l. reuteri were also positive, to lesser extents. diammonium citrate in de man-rogosa-sharpe broth was determined as a precursor of the succinic acid produced. production rates were about 70% on a molar basis with two fresh strains tested. succinic acid was also produced from fumaric and malic  acids but not from dl-isocitric, alpha-ketoglutaric, and pyruvic acids. the present study is considered to provide the first evidence on the production of succinic acid, an important flavoring substance in dairy products and fermented beverages, from citrate by lactobacilli.
