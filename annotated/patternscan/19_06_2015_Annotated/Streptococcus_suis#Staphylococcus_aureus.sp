TI  == potential probiotic attributes of a new strain of bacillus coagulans cgmcc 9951 isolated from healthy piglet feces.
AB  == a new strain of bacillus coagulans cgmcc 9551, which has a broad range of antibacterial activities against six main pathogenic bacteria including escherichia coli o8, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar enteritidis, streptococcus suis, listeria monocytogenes and pasteurella multocida, was isolated from healthy piglet feces. in adhesion assay, the isolate exhibited a stronger adhesion to pig intestinal mucus than that of b. subtilis jt143 and l. acidophilus ly24 respectively isolated from bioplus((r))2b and florafit((r)) probiotics (p < 0.05). the adhesion activity reached 44.5 +/- 3.2,  48.9 +/- 2.6, 42.6 +/- 3.3 and 37.6 +/- 2.4 % to jejunum, ileum, transverse colon and sigmoid colon, separately. the survival rate of b. coagulans cgmcc 9551 was reduced by only 20 % at 4 h exposure under 0.9 % w/v bile salt. the strain was fully resistant to ph 2 for 2 h with 90.1 +/- 3.5 % survival and susceptible to 15 antibiotics commonly used in veterinary medicine. additionally, the bacteria showed amylase, protease and cellulase activities. the safety assessment demonstrated the lack of toxicity potential in b. coagulans cgmcc 9551 by ligated rabbit ileal loop assay, acute and subchronic toxicity test. these results implied that that the new strain of b. coagulans cgmcc 9951 isolated from healthy piglet feces has promising probiotic characteristics and offers desirable opportunities for its successful commercialization as one excellent candidate probiotic.

TI  == cloning, expression, and purification of a new antibacterial substance gene from  larvae of musca domestica (diptera: muscidae).
AB  == musca domestica l. (diptera: muscidae), the housefly, exhibits unique immune defenses and can produce antibacterial substances upon stimulation with bacteria. on the basis of the cdna library constructed using the suppression subtractive hybridization method, a 1188-bp antibacterial substance gene, which we named as566, was amplified by rapid amplification of cdna ends from m. domestica larva  stimulated with salmonella pullorum (enterobacteriaceae: salmonella). in this study, the full-length as566 gene was cloned and inserted into a his-tagged escherichia coli (enterobacteriaceae: escherichia) prokaryotic expression system  to enable production of the recombinant protein. the recombinant as566 protein was purified in denatured form from inclusion bodies and renatured to obtain functionally active as566 protein. the bacteriostatic activity of the recombinant purified as566 protein was assessed using the oxford plate assay system and the results indicated that as566 had antibacterial activity against six bacteria, including an e. coli clinical isolate, s. pullorum, streptococcus bovis (streptococcaceae: streptococcus), streptococcus suis, and staphylococcus aureus  (staphylococcaceae: staphylococcus) in vitro. the antibacterial activity of as566 toward gram- bacteria was two times greater than that against gram+ bacteria. the sequencing results and blast analysis showed that the antibacterial substance gene as566 was not homologous to any other antibacterial substance genes in genbank. the antibacterial mechanisms of the newly discovered as566 protein warrant further study.

TI  == suicin 90-1330 from a nonvirulent strain of streptococcus suis: a nisin-related lantibiotic active on gram-positive swine pathogens.
AB  == streptococcus suis serotype 2 is known to cause severe infections (meningitis, endocarditis, and septicemia) in pigs and is considered an emerging zoonotic agent. antibiotics have long been used in the swine industry for disease treatment/prevention and growth promoters. this pattern of utilization resulted in the spread of antibiotic resistance in s. suis worldwide. interestingly, pigs  may harbor s. suis in their tonsils without developing diseases, while north american strains belonging to the sequence type 28 (st28) are nonvirulent in animal models. consequently, the aim of this study was to purify and characterize a bacteriocin produced by a nonvirulent strain of s. suis serotype 2, with a view to a potential therapeutic and preventive application. s. suis 90-1330 belonging  to st28 and previously shown to be nonvirulent in an animal model exhibited antibacterial activity toward all s. suis pathogenic isolates tested. the bacteriocin produced by this strain was purified to homogeneity by cationic exchange and reversed-phase fast protein liquid chromatography. given its properties (molecular mass of <4 kda, heat, ph and protease stability, and the presence of modified amino acids), the bacteriocin, named suicin 90-1330, belongs to the lantibiotic class. using a dna-binding fluorophore, the bacteriocin was found to possess a membrane permeabilization activity. when tested on other swine pathogens, the suicin showed activity against staphylococcus hyicus and staphylococcus aureus, whereas it was inactive against all gram-negative bacteria tested. amino acid sequencing of the purified bacteriocin showed homology (90.9%  identity) with nisin u produced by streptococcus uberis. the putative gene cluster involved in suicin production was amplified by pcr and sequence analysis  revealed the presence of 11 open reading frames, including the structural gene and those required for the modification of amino acids, export, regulation, and immunity. further studies will evaluate the ability of suicin 90-1330 or the producing strain to prevent experimental s. suis infections in pigs.

TI  == impact of antibiotic use in the swine industry.
AB  == antibiotic resistance in bacteria associated with pigs not only affects pig production but also has an impact on human health through the transfer of resistant organisms and associated genes via the food chain. this can compromise  treatment of human infections. in the past most attention was paid to glycopeptide and streptogramin resistance in enterococci, fluoroquinolone resistance in campylobacter and multi-drug resistance in escherichia coli and salmonella. while these are still important the focus has shifted to esbl producing organisms selected by the use of ceftiofur and cefquinome in pigs. in addition livestock-associated methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa)  suddenly emerged in 2007. we also need to consider multi-resistant strains of streptococcus suis. environmental contamination arising from piggery wastewater and spreading of manure slurry on pastures is also a growing problem.

TI  == scabies mites alter the skin microbiome and promote growth of opportunistic pathogens in a porcine model.
AB  == background: the resident skin microbiota plays an important role in restricting pathogenic bacteria, thereby protecting the host. scabies mites (sarcoptes scabiei) are thought to promote bacterial infections by breaching the skin barrier and excreting molecules that inhibit host innate immune responses. epidemiological studies in humans confirm increased incidence of impetigo, generally caused by staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes, secondary to the epidermal infestation with the parasitic mite. it is therefore possible that mite infestation could alter the healthy skin microbiota making way for the  opportunistic pathogens. a longitudinal study to test this hypothesis in humans is near impossible due to ethical reasons. in a porcine model we generated scabies infestations closely resembling the disease manifestation in humans and investigated the scabies associated changes in the skin microbiota over the course of a mite infestation. methodology/principal findings: in a 21 week trial, skin scrapings were collected from pigs infected with s. scabies var. suis and scabies-free control animals. a total of 96 skin scrapings were collected before, during infection and after acaricide treatment, and analyzed by bacterial 16s rdna tag-encoded flx-titanium amplicon pyrosequencing. we found significant changes in the epidermal microbiota, in particular a dramatic increase in staphylococcus correlating with the onset of mite infestation in animals challenged with scabies mites. this increase persisted beyond treatment from mite infection and healing of skin. furthermore, the staphylococci population shifted  from the commensal s. hominis on the healthy skin prior to scabies mite challenge to s. chromogenes, which is increasingly recognized as being pathogenic, coinciding with scabies infection in pigs. in contrast, all animals in the scabies-free cohort remained relatively free of staphylococcus throughout the trial. conclusions/significance: this is the first experimental in vivo evidence  supporting previous assumptions that establishment of pathogens follow scabies infection. our findings provide an explanation for a biologically important aspect of the disease pathogenesis. the methods developed from this pig trial will serve as a guide to analyze human clinical samples. studies building on this will offer implications for development of novel intervention strategies against  the mites and the secondary infections.

TI  == colloidal gold-based immunochromatographic strip test compromising optimised combinations of anti-s. suis capsular polysaccharide polyclonal antibodies for detection of streptococcus suis.
AB  == a rapid diagnosis kit that detects streptococcus suis (s. suis) antigens from urine with an immunochromatographic stripe (ics) test was developed in this study. the ics test was produced using colloidal gold coated with polyclonal antibodies (pabs) against s. suis. the pabs were developed from rabbits immunised with s. suis serotype 2 capsular polysaccharides (cps). development of the pabs was investigated to establish their binding to cps and to determine the maximum sensitivity of two combination antibodies for the ics test. the results of the ics optimisation revealed that the combinations of pab c-n1 and pab c-n2 had the  highest sensitivity to cps. the minimum limitation of ics sensitivity indicated 1.0 x 10(4) colony forming units (cfu) and a cps concentration of 0.05 microg. the assay time for detection of s. suis antigens is less than 15 min, which is suitable for rapid detection. a cross-reactive test was also conducted, and it detected no other bacteria (streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus agalactiae, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and klebsiella pneumoniae). the cross-reactivity of other serotypes in s. suis was also investigated, and tests for serotypes of 1, 1/2, 3, 4, 5, 6,  7, 8, 9, 14, and 16 were positive. this study presents the first report of a development of an ics that enables the quantitative detection of streptococcal antigens. the s. suis ics provides several advantages over other methods, including the speed and simplicity of use.

TI  == high-level expression, purification and characterisation of porcine beta-defensin 2 in pichia pastoris and its potential as a cost-efficient growth promoter in porcine feed.
AB  == porcine beta-defensin 2 (pbd2), a recently discovered porcine defensin that is produced by the intestine, exerts antimicrobial activities and innate immune effects that are linked to intestinal diseases in pigs. here, we report a codon-optimised protein corresponding to mature pbd2 cdna that was expressed and  purified in pichia pastoris yeast. the highest amount of secreted protein (3,694.0 mg/l) was reached 144 h into a 150-h induction during high-density cultivation. precipitation followed by gel exclusion chromatography yielded 383.7 mg/l purified recombinant pbd2 (rpbd2) with a purity of ~93.7 %. two recombinant  proteins of 5,458.5 and 5,258.4 da were detected in the mass spectrum due to variation in the amino-terminus. the rpbd2 exhibited high antimicrobial activity  against a broad range of pig pathogenic bacteria (minimal inhibitory concentration [mic] 32-128 mug/ml); the highest activity was observed against salmonella choleraesuis, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus suis (mic 32-64  mug/ml). however, rpbd2 also inhibited the growth of probiotics such as lactobacillus plantarum, bacillus subtilis and saccharomyces cerevisiae, but at lower efficacies than the pathogens. purified or unpurified rpbd2 also maintained high activity over a wide range of ph values (2.0-10.0), a high thermal stability at 100 degrees c for 40 min and significant resistance to papain, pepsin and trypsin. in addition, the activity of rpbd2 towards s. aureus was unaffected by 10 mm dithiothreitol (dtt) and 20 % dimethyl sulphoxide (dmso). our results suggest that pbd2 could be produced efficiently in large quantities in p. pastoris and be a substitute for traditional antibiotics for growth promotion in  the porcine industry.

TI  == identification of the novel lincosamide resistance gene lnu(e) truncated by isenfa5-cfr-isenfa5 insertion in streptococcus suis: de novo synthesis and confirmation of functional activity in staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == the novel lincosamide resistance gene lnu(e), truncated by insertion of an isenfa5-cfr-isenfa5 segment, was identified in streptococcus suis. the gene lnu(e) encodes a 173-amino-acid protein with </=69.4% identity to other lincosamide nucleotidyltransferases. the lnu(e) gene and its promoter region were de novo synthesized, and staphylococcus aureus rn4220 carrying a shuttle vector with the cloned lnu(e) gene showed a 16-fold increase in the lincomycin mic. mass spectrometry experiments demonstrated that lnu(e) catalyzed the nucleotidylation  of lincomycin.

TI  == novel bacteriophage lysin with broad lytic activity protects against mixed infection by streptococcus pyogenes and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and streptococcus pyogenes (group a streptococcus [gras]) cause serious and sometimes fatal human diseases.  they are among the many gram-positive pathogens for which resistance to leading antibiotics has emerged. as a result, alternative therapies need to be developed  to combat these pathogens. we have identified a novel bacteriophage lysin (plyss2), derived from a streptococcus suis phage, with broad lytic activity against mrsa, vancomycin-intermediate s. aureus (visa), streptococcus suis, listeria, staphylococcus simulans, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus equi, streptococcus agalactiae (group b streptococcus [gbs]), s. pyogenes, streptococcus sanguinis, group g streptococci (ggs), group e streptococci (ges),  and streptococcus pneumoniae. plyss2 has an n-terminal cysteine-histidine aminopeptidase (chap) catalytic domain and a c-terminal sh3b binding domain. it is stable at 50 degrees c for 30 min, 37 degrees c for >24 h, 4 degrees c for 15  days, and -80 degrees c for >7 months; it maintained full activity after 10 freeze-thaw cycles. plyss2 at 128 mug/ml in vitro reduced mrsa and s. pyogenes growth by 5 logs and 3 logs within 1 h, respectively, and exhibited a mic of 16 mug/ml for mrsa. a single, 2-mg dose of plyss2 protected 92% (22/24) of the mice  in a bacteremia model of mixed mrsa and s. pyogenes infection. serially increasing exposure of mrsa and s. pyogenes to plyss2 or mupirocin resulted in no observed resistance to plyss2 and resistance to mupirocin. to date, no other lysin has shown such notable broad lytic activity, stability, and efficacy against multiple, leading, human bacterial pathogens; as such, plyss2 has all the characteristics to be an effective therapeutic.

TI  == zinc as an agent for the prevention of biofilm formation by pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == aims: biofilm formation is important for the persistence of bacteria in hostile environments. bacteria in a biofilm are usually more resistant to antibiotics and disinfectants than planktonic bacteria. our laboratory previously reported that low concentrations of zinc inhibit biofilm formation of actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae. the aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of zinc on growth and biofilm formation of other bacterial swine pathogens. methods and results: to determine the effect of zinc on biofilm formation, biofilms were grown with or without zinc in 96-well plates and stained with crystal violet. at  micromolar concentrations (0-250 mu mol l(-1)), zinc weakly inhibited bacterial growth and it effectively blocked biofilm formation by a. pleuropneumoniae, salmonella typhymurium and haemophilus parasuis in a dose-dependent manner. additionally, biofilm formation of escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus suis was slightly inhibited by zinc. however, zinc did not disperse preformed biofilms. to determine whether zinc inhibits biofilm formation when poly-n-acetylglucosamine (pga) is present, pga was detected with the lectin wheat germ agglutinin. only a. pleuropneumoniae and staph. aureus biofilms were found to contain pga. conclusion: zinc used at nonbactericidal concentrations can inhibit biofilm formation by several gram-negative and gram-positive bacterial swine pathogens. significance and impact of study: the antibiofilm activity of zinc could provide a tool to fight biofilms, and the nonspecific inhibitory effect may well extend to other important human and animal bacterial pathogens.

TI  == identification of a novel collagen type capital i, ukrainian-binding protein from streptococcus suis serotype 2.
AB  == streptococcus suis, a major pathogen of pigs, is an emerging zoonotic agent that  causes meningitis and septic shock. cbp40 is a putative virulent gene that has been identified using suppression subtractive hybridization performed on the virulent s. suis serotype 2 strain ha9801 and the avirulent s. suis serotype 2 strain t15. based on predicted protein features showing a shared conserved domain with the collagen-binding protein cna of staphylococcus aureus, cbp40 is likely to function as a direct mediator of collagen adhesion. here, the cbp40 gene was cloned and the recombinant protein purified. western blotting using swine convalescent sera confirmed its role as an immunogenic protein. collagen binding  activity could be detected by western affinity blot and elisa. conversely, deletion of the cbp40 gene reduced bacterial adhesion to hep-2 cells, capacity for biofilm formation, and virulence in a zebrafish infection model. the response of the bend.3 cell line to infection with the s. suis serotype 2 strain zy05719 and the cbp40-knockout strain was evaluated using gene expression arrays. the differentially expressed genes were involved in inflammatory and immune responses, leukocyte adhesion and heterophilic cell adhesion. collectively, these data suggest that cbp40 plays an important role as an extracellular matrix adhesion protein that interacts with host cells during infection.

TI  == bacteraemias in tropical australia: changing trends over a 10-year period.
AB  == bacteraemia is an important cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. this is the largest reported study of bacteraemias in australia. the presence of organisms endemic to the tropical region and the changing trends described have significant implications for empirical antibiotic therapy. this retrospective study examined 8976 blood cultures from townsville hospital, a regional australian hospital located in the tropics over a 10-year period. the rate of bacteraemic episodes during the study period was 10.12 per 1000 admissions. intravenous devices (18.7%), immunosuppressive therapy (16.1%), and urinary tract infections (16.1%) were important sources for bacteraemia. the most common organisms were staphylococcus aureus (20.9%) and escherichia. coli (15.6%). a significant reduction was observed in s. aureus susceptibility to clindamycin (p  < 0.05) and in e. coli susceptibility to gentamicin. organisms isolated that were of relevance to the tropics of australia included burkholderia pseudomallei, group a streptococcus, and brucella suis.

TI  == development of a single-tube loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay for detection of four pathogens of bacterial meningitis.
AB  == several loop-mediated isothermal amplification (lamp) assays have been developed  to detect common causative pathogens of bacterial meningitis (bm). however, no lamp assay is reported to detect streptococcus agalactiae and streptococcus suis, which are also among common pathogens of bm. moreover, it is laborious and expensive by performing multiple reactions for each sample to detect bacterial pathogen. thus, we aimed to design and develop a single-tube lamp assay capable of detecting multiple bacterial species, based on the nucleotide sequences of the 16s rrna genes of the bacteria. the nucleotide sequences of the 16s rrna genes of main pathogens involved in bm were aligned to identify conserved regions, which were further used to design broad range specific lamp assay primers. we successfully designed a set of broad range specific lamp assay primers for simultaneous detection of four species including staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. suis and s. agalactiae. the broad range lamp assay was highly specific without cross-reactivity with other bacteria including haemophilus influenzae, neisseria meningitidis and escherichia coli. the sensitivity of our lamp assay was 100-1000 times higher compared with the conventional pcr assay. the bacterial species could be identified after digestion of the lamp products with restriction endonuclease ddei and haeiii.

TI  == future challenges in the elimination of bacterial meningitis.
AB  == despite the widespread implementation of several effective vaccines over the past few decades, bacterial meningitis caused by streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria meningitidis and group b streptococcus (gbs) still results  in unacceptably high levels of human mortality and morbidity. a residual disease  burden due to bacterial meningitis is also apparent due to a number of persistent or emerging pathogens, including mycobacterium tuberculosis, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella spp. and streptococcus suis. here, we review the current status of bacterial meningitis caused by these pathogens, highlighting how past and present vaccination programs have attempted to counter  these pathogens. we discuss how improved pathogen surveillance, implementation of current vaccines, and development of novel vaccines may be expected to further reduce bacterial meningitis and related diseases in the future.

TI  == combined antibacterial activity of phage lytic proteins holin and lysin from streptococcus suis bacteriophage smp.
AB  == development of novel antibacterial agents is required to control infection with multidrug-resistant streptococcus suis. holsmp and lysmp, the holin and lysin of  s. suis serotype 2 bacteriophage, named smp, are responsible for lysis of host cells and release of progeny phage. holsmp and lysmp expressed in escherichia coli bl21(de3) exerted efficient activity at 37 degrees c, ph 5.2, with addition  of 0.8 % beta-mercaptoethanol. lytic spectra of purified holsmp, lysmp or holsmp  + lysmp mixture were investigated. holsmp, exhibiting a narrow lytic spectrum, was effective against staphylococcus aureus and bacillus subtilis, which were insensitive to lysmp. moreover, holsmp was identified as a promising antibacterial agent which was able to extend the spectrum of lysmp. the data suggest that combined use of holin and lysin could be a candidate strategy for resolution of drug resistance.

TI  == microbiological identification and analysis of swine tonsils collected from carcasses at slaughter.
AB  == the primary objective of this 7-month study was to determine the prevalence of porcine pathogens of the tonsil of the soft palate of swine at slaughter. additional objectives were to determine if sampling the carcasses of normal or abnormal hogs provided different microbiological profiles and if the slaughter plant provides a feasible sampling frame and environment for detecting and monitoring important pathogens in tonsils that have health implications for both  swine and humans. a total of 395 samples were collected from 264 farms. of these, 180 tonsils were collected from normal carcasses and 215 tonsils were collected from carcasses that were diverted to the hold rail. laboratory testing included bacteriological culture and identification as well as real time-polymerase chain  reaction (pcr) testing for porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (pprsv) and immunohistochemistry (ihc) for porcine circovirus-2 (pcv-2). the most commonly isolated bacteria included: streptococcus suis (53.7%), arcanobacterium  pyogenes (29.9%), pasteurella multocida (27.3%), and streptococcus porcinus (19.5%). virus screening revealed evidence of prrsv and pcv-2 in 22.0% and 11.9%  of the samples, respectively. salmonella typhimurium and yersinia enterocolitica  were isolated in 0.5% and 1.8% of the samples, respectively. tonsils collected from the hold rail were more likely to be positive for staphylococcus hyicus [odds ratio (or) = 7.51, confidence interval (ci) = 2.89 to 19.54], streptococcus porcinus (or = 9.93, ci = 4.27 to 23.10), and streptococcus suis (or = 2.16, ci = 1.45 to 3.24). tonsils collected from abnormal carcasses were less likely to be positive for staphylococcus aureus (or = 0.05, ci = 0.005 to 0.482).

AB  == recombinant plectasin, the first fungus defensin, was expressed in pichia pastoris and purified, and its physical, chemical and antimicrobial characteristics were studied. following a 120 h induction of recombinant yeast, the amount of total secreted protein reached 748.63 mug/ml. the percentage of recombinant plectasin was estimated to be 71.79% of the total protein. after purification with a sephadex g-25 column and rp-hplc, the identity of plectasin was verified by maldi-tof ms. plectasin exhibited strong antimicrobial activity against the gram-positive bacteria staphyloccocusaureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, and streptococcus suis. at a concentration of 2560 mug/ml, this peptide showed approximately equal activity against s. aureus, s. epidermidis, s. suis, and s. pneumoniae, when compared to 320 mug/ml vancomycin, 640 mug/ml penicillin, 320 mug/ml vancomycin and 160 mug/ml vancomycin, respectively. in addition, plectasin showed anti-s. aureus activity over a wide ph range of 2.0 and 10.0, a high thermal stability at 100 degrees c for 1h and remarkable resistance to papain and pepsin. the expression and characterization of recombinant plectasin in p. pastoris has potential to treat streptococcus and staphyloccocus infections when most traditional antibiotics show no effect on them. our results indicate that plectasin can be produced in large quantities, and that it has pharmaceutical importance for the prevention and clinical treatment of staphyloccocus and streptococcus infections.

TI  == plasma concentrations resulting from florfenicol preparations given to pigs in their drinking water.
AB  == florfenicol administered through the drinking water has been recommended as a metaphylactic antibacterial drug to control outbreaks of respiratory diseases in  pigs caused by strains of actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae and pasteurella multocida, yet it is difficult to pinpoint in practice when the drug is given metaphylactically or therapeutically. further, pigs are likely to reject florfenicol-medicated water, and plasma concentrations of the drug are likely to  be marginal for diseases caused by escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and staphylococcus aureus. the reported minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) values for these organisms show a breakpoint of 2 to 3 mug/ml. an experiment was conducted during september and october 2009. one hundred twenty healthy crossbred pigs (landrace-yorkshire), weighing 23 +/- 6.2 kg, were used in this trial. they  were randomly assigned to 5 groups, with 3 replicates of 8 animals/group. two commercial preparations of florfenicol were administered through the drinking water at 2 concentrations (0.01 and 0.015%). water intake was measured before and after medication, and plasma concentrations of florfenicol were determined by hplc. considerable rejection of florfenicol-medicated water was observed. however, plasma florfenicol concentrations were of a range sufficient for a methaphylaxis approach to preventing disease by bacteria, with mic breakpoints of </= 0.25 mug/ml. decreased efficacy as a metaphylactic medication should be expected for bacteria with mic >0.25 mug/ml, considering the reported existence of bacteria resistant to florfenicol and the natural resistance of streptococcus  suis or e. coli to this drug.

TI  == microbial communities in the tonsils of healthy pigs.
AB  == the tonsils of mammals such as humans and pigs are colonized with an extensive microbiota and are frequently the site for asymptomatic carriage of bacterial pathogens. the goal of this study was to determine the composition of the microbial community of the tonsils in healthy pigs. tonsils were collected from eight pigs from two different healthy herds. samples of the tonsils from each pig were used for culture dependent and culture independent identification of the microbial community. aerobic cultivation identified pasteurella multocida, actinobacillus spp., staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus suis, streptococcus dysgalactiae, and escherichia coli from >/= 50% of the pigs in both herds. for culture independent studies, microbial community members were identified by 16s rrna sequences using the ribosomal database project pipeline programs developed at michigan state university. dominant genera identified by 16s rrna analysis in pigs from both herds included actinobacillus,  haemophilus, pasteurella, porphyromonas, fusobacterium, bacteroides, and prevotella. these genera were detected in nearly every pig regardless of herd. in contrast, there was an asymmetric distribution of minor genera between the two herds, suggesting herd-specific differences in the microbial communities. in addition, we demonstrated primer bias between two frequently used forward primers when targeting the tonsillar community. our results suggest that the major bacterial community members found in porcine tonsils are the same regardless of herd, while the minor species are unique to each herd. this is the first analysis using 16s rrna sequence libraries of the composition of microbial communities in  the porcine upper respiratory tract.

TI  == uncovering newly emerging variants of streptococcus suis, an important zoonotic agent.
AB  == streptococcus suis is recognized as a major swine pathogen and an emerging zoonotic agent. two large-scale outbreaks of severe s. suis epidemics occurred in china in 1998 and 2005 that posed serious concerns to public health and challenged the conventional conception that opportunistic infections of s. suis serotype 2 (ss2) in humans were only sporadic cases. an extensive, collaborative  study on chinese ss2 variants, which exhibit strong invasiveness and high pathogenicity, has resulted in the description of a new disease form of streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (stss) and a putative pathogenicity island (termed 89k). the abbreviation of stss is used for the severe disease caused by both staphylococci and streptococci. the main virulence factors involved in stss  caused by either staphylococcus aureus or streptococcus pyogenes consist of so-called superantigens or molecules that trigger a nonspecific, uncontrolled activation of t cells and massive cytokine release. however, although a collection of new virulence factors have been described, no superantigen candidates have been found for ss2 strains, implying that a different mechanism could be involved in the stss form caused by ss2 variants.

TI  == purified recombinant phage lysin lysmp: an extensive spectrum of lytic activity for swine streptococci.
AB  == bacteriophage lysin has attracted considerable attentions as possible antimicrobial agents for solution of antibiotic resistance. smp was a streptococcus suis serotype 2 bacteriophage isolated from nasal swabs of healthy  bama minipigs. the putative smp bacteriophage lysin, designated lysmp, was recombinantly expressed in escherichia coli bl21, and chromatographically purified. treated with 0.8% of beta-mercaptoethanol, lysmp exhibited an extensive lysin spectrum than those of whole phage against bacteria investigated. s. suis serotype 2, s. suis serotype 7 and s. suis serotype 9 strains were recovered from diseased pigs between 1998 and 2005 in china. fifteen of seventeen strains of s.  suis serotype 2 could be lysed, as well as s. suis serotype 7 and 9, streptococcus equi ssp. zooepidemicus and staphylococcus aureus. but e. coli and  salmonella enterica were not affected. purified lysmp showed high degrading efficiency against pmsf or lysozyme treated cells comparing to pbs washed cells.  optimum ph and temperature conditions for the lysin were investigated by turbidity reduction assay. the lysin exerted efficient lysis activity at 37 degrees c, ph 5.2. the turbidity of bacterium investigated was observed to decrease by 1.2-68% in 30 min. result indicated that putative lysmp could be a candidate antimicrobial agent in controlling s. suis infection.

TI  == the involvement of sortase a in high virulence of stss-causing streptococcus suis serotype 2.
AB  == sortase a (srta), originally identified as a transpeptidase in staphylococcus aureus, plays key roles in full virulence of pathogenic bacteria. in silico genome-wide search suggested a srta homologue from 05zyh33, a chinese human isolate of streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (stss)-causing streptococcus suis serotype 2 (s. suis 2, ss2). an isogenic srta mutant (deltasrta) of 05zyh33 strain was obtained by homologous recombination. immunofluorescence analysis revealed that two known virulence-associated surface proteins featuring leu-pro-x-thr-gly motif, muramidase-released protein and surface antigen one, were absent in the deltasrta. piglet infection experiments showed that deletion of srta attenuated the full virulence of 05zyh33 strain, and impaired its colonizing potential in specific organs. furthermore, the deltasrta displayed significant reduction in adherence to human cells (hep-2 and human umbilical vein endothelial cells). collectively, we concluded that srta was involved in the virulence manifestation of stss-causing ss2.

TI  == additions of killed whole cell bacteria preparations to freund complete adjuvant  alter laying hen antibody response to soluble protein antigen.
AB  == passive transfer of antibodies from hen to egg has value to both the producer of  commercial polyclonal egg antibody and the producer of hatching eggs. water-in-oil emulsions are commonly amended with immune stimulants such as mycobacteria (e.g., freund complete adjuvant; fca) to increase antibody production to soluble protein antigens (spa). recent discoveries of the mechanisms by which microbial products act as adjuvants led us to hypothesize that additions of killed whole cell bacteria (bacterins) to fca could improve antibody responses to spa. all injections used in each experiment were water-in-oil emulsions (50:50) containing 3 mg/ml of phospholipase a(2) (pla(2))  immunogen. additionally, all primary control and treatment injections contained heat-killed mycobacterium butyricum immunogens from fca. in addition to pla(2) and fca, primary treatment injections contained various microbial bacterin immunogens. hence, the experimental treatment of all experiments was addition of  a commercial source of microbial bacterin to fca for the primary injection only.  booster injections were the same as the primary control injections except freund  incomplete adjuvant replaced fca. anti-body titers to pla(2) in yolk were determined by elisa. bacterins tested as additives to fca were escherichia coli,  staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus suis, and corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis. escherichia coli bacterin added to fca decreased egg yolk antibody titer to spa by 23% in hens of different ages and strains (p < 0.0001).  in a second experiment, a 51% decrease in antibody production associated with e.  coli bacterin was sustained for several weeks after the primary immunization (p = 0.003). staphylococcus aureus or streptococcus suis combined with fca increased egg yolk antibody 62 and 51%, respectively (p < 0.05), and corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis had no effect. in conclusion, the addition of bacterin to fca  can influence hen antibody response to spa as measured in egg yolks. it is hypothesized that the difference in antibody production may be related to the composition of various pathogen associated molecular patterns in the primary injection.

TI  == evaluation of pyelonephritis in culled indoor and outdoor high parity sows.
AB  == the present trial was conducted in hungary in neighboring large indoor and outdoor pig production units, belonging to the same breeding company. rejected kidneys from 201 (out of 241; 83.4%) outdoor, and 191 (out of 512, 37.3%) indoor  high parity sows, with previous history of recidiving postparturient fever and excessive postparturient vulvovaginal discharge were gross pathologically bacteriologically, and histologically evaluated. all rejected kidneys revealed chronic pyelonephritis. in outdoor sows escherichia (e.) coli and actinobaculum (a.) suis were cultured from all kidneys. besides e. coli and a. suis, clostridium spp., arcanobacterium pyogenes, gram-positive streptococci (enterococci, streptococcus faecalis), staphylococci (staphylococcus (s.) albus,  s. epidermis, s. aureus), erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, and klebsiella spp. were  concurrently found in 131 (64.7%) kidneys; pseudomonas aeruginosa, citrobacter, pasteurella multocida, proteus spp. were concurrently found beside e. coli and a. suis in 71 (35.3%) kidneys. in indoor sows e. coli and a. suis were cultured from all kidneys as well. pseudomonas aeruginosa, citrobacter, pasteurella multocida,  proteus spp. were found beside e. coli and a. suis in 21 (11%) kidneys. however only 6 sows (3.1%) revealed the concurrent presence of clostridium spp., arcanobacterium pyogenes, gram-positive streptococci (enterococci, streptococcus  faecalis), staphylococci (s. albus, s. epidermis, s. aureus), erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, and klebsiella spp. implications: in eastern european climate, more high parity outdoor sows with recidiving postparturient fever and vulvovaginal discharge have pyelonephritis and higher diversity of pathogenic bacteria in the renal pelvis compared with indoor sows.

TI  == reporter metabolite analysis of transcriptional profiles of a staphylococcus aureus strain with normal phenotype and its isogenic hemb mutant displaying the small-colony-variant phenotype.
AB  == in this study, full-genome dna microarrays based on the sequence of staphylococcus aureus n315 were used to compare the transcriptome of a clinical s. aureus strain with a normal phenotype to that of its isogenic mutant with a stable small-colony-variant (scv) phenotype (hemb::ermb). in addition to standard statistical analyses, systems biology advances were applied to identify reporter  metabolites and to achieve a more detailed survey of genome-wide expression differences between the hemb mutant and its parental strain. genes of enzymes involved in glycolytic and fermentative pathways were found to be up-regulated in the hemb mutant. furthermore, our analyses allowed identification of additional differences between the normal-phenotype s. aureus and the scv, most of which were related to metabolism. profound differences were identified especially in purine biosynthesis as well as in arginine and proline metabolism. of particular  interest, a hypothetical gene of the crp/fnr family (sa2424) that is part of the  arginine-deiminase (ad) pathway, whose homologue in streptococcus suis is assumed to be involved in intracellular persistence, showed significantly increased transcription in the hemb mutant. the hemb mutant potentially uses the up-regulated ad pathway to produce atp or (through ammonia production) to counteract the acidic environment that prevails intracellularly. moreover, genes  involved in capsular polysaccharide and cell wall synthesis were found to be significantly up-regulated in the hemb mutant and therefore potentially responsible for the changed cell morphology of scvs. in conclusion, the identified differences may be responsible for the scv phenotype and its association with chronic and persistent infections.

TI  == surface plasmon resonance biosensors for detection of pathogenic microorganisms:  strategies to secure food and environmental safety.
AB  == this review describes the exploitation of exclusively optical surface plasmon resonance (spr) biosensors for the direct and indirect detection of pathogenic microorganisms in food chains and the environment. direct detection is, in most cases, facilitated by the use of defined monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies raised against (a part of) the target pathogenic microorganisms. the antibodies were immobilized to a solid phase of the sensor to capture the microbe from the sample. alternatively, antibodies were used in an inhibition-like assay involving incubation with the target organism prior to analysis of nonbound antibodies. the free immunoglobins were screened on a sensor surface coated with either purified  antigens or with fc or fab binding antibodies. discussed examples of these approaches are the determination of escherichia coli o1 57:h7, salmonella spp., and listeria monocytogenes. another direct detection strategy involved spr analysis of polymerase chain reaction products of shiga toxin-2 genes reporting the presence of e. coli o157:h7 in human stool. metabolic products have been exploited as biomarkers for the presence of a microbial agent, such as enterotoxin b and a virulence factor for the occurrence of staphylococcus aureus  and streptococcus suis, respectively. indirect detection, on the other hand, is performed by analysis of a humoral immune response of the infected animal or human. by immobilization of specific antigenic structures, infections with herpes simplex and human immunodeficiency viruses, salmonella and treponema pallidum bacteria, and schistosoma spp. parasites were revealed using human, avian, and porcine sera and avian eggs. bound antibodies were easily isotyped using an spr biosensor to reveal the infection history of the individual. discussed studies show the recent recognition of the suitability of this type of instrument for (rapid) detection of health-threatening microbes to food and environmental microbial safety.

TI  == pulmonary infections in swine induce altered porcine surfactant protein d expression and localization to dendritic cells in bronchial-associated lymphoid tissue.
AB  == surfactant protein d (sp-d) is a pattern-recognition molecule of the innate immune system that recognizes various microbial surface-specific carbohydrate and lipid patterns. in vitro data has suggested that this binding may lead to increased microbial association with macrophages and dendritic cells. the aim of  the present in vivo study was to study the expression of porcine sp-d (psp-d) in  the lung during different pulmonary bacterial infections, and the effect of the routes of infection on this expression was elucidated. furthermore, the aim was to study the in vivo spatial relationship among psp-d, pathogens, phagocytic cells and dendritic cells. lung tissue was collected from experimental and natural bronchopneumonias caused by actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae or staphylococcus aureus, and from embolic and diffuse interstitial pneumonia, caused by staph. aureus or arcanobacterium pyogenes and streptococcus suis serotype 2, respectively. by comparing normal and diseased lung tissue from the same lungs, increased diffuse psp-d immunoreactivity was seen in the surfactant in both acute and chronic bronchopneumonias, while such increased expression of psp-d was generally not present in the interstitial pneumonias. co-localization of psp-d, alveolar macrophages and bacteria was demonstrated, and psp-d showed a  patchy distribution on the membranes of alveolar macrophages. sp-d immunoreactivity was intracellular in dendritic cells. the dendritic cells were identified by their morphology, the absence of macrophage marker immunoreactivity and the presence of dendritic cell marker immunoreactivity. increased expression  of psp-d in the surfactant coincided with presence of psp-d-positive dendritic cells in bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (balt), indicating a possible transport of psp-d through the specialized m cells overlying (balt). in conclusion, we have shown that psp-d expression in the lung surfactant is induced by bacterial infection by an aerogenous route rather than by a haematogenous route, and that the protein interacts specifically with alveolar macrophages and  with dendritic cells in microbial-induced balt. the function of the interaction between psp-d and dendritic cells in balt remain unclear, but psp-d could represent a link between the innate and adaptive immune system, facilitating the  bacterial antigen presentation by dendritic cells in balt.

TI  == generation of transposon insertion mutant libraries for gram-positive bacteria by electroporation of phage mu dna transposition complexes.
AB  == transposon mutagenesis is a powerful technique for generating collections of insertion mutants for genetic studies. this paper describes how phage mu dna transposition complexes, transpososomes, can be exploited for gene delivery to efficiently introduce selectable markers to genomes of gram-positive bacteria. mu transpososomes were assembled in vitro with custom-designed mini-mu transposons,  concentrated, and electroporated into cells of three gram-positive bacterial species: staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus suis. within cells, the complexes reproduced an authentic dna transposition reaction and integrated the delivered transposons into the bacterial genomes, yielding single-copy insertions. the integration efficiency among different species and strains of gram-positive bacteria ranged from 1x10(1) to 2x10(4) c.f.u. (mug introduced transposon dna)(-1). the strategy should be applicable to a variety of other gram-positive species after initial optimization of certain key factors affecting transposon delivery, such as the preparation method of competent cells  and physical parameters of electroporation. this study extends the scope of the mu transpososome delivery-based genomic dna integration strategy to gram-positive bacteria. thus, a straightforward generation of sizeable mutant banks is feasible for these bacteria, potentiating several types of genomic-level approaches for studies of a variety of important bacterial processes, such as pathogenicity.

AB  == by alkylation of hexamethylenetetramine with halogenated derivatives of ketones,  ethers, esters or amides of acids, alkyl- and aralkyl halides the corresponding n-monoalkylated compounds of hexamethylenetetramine were obtained. the quaternization of pyridine nitrogen in 5,6-benzoquinoline, 8-hydroxyquinoline, quinoline, 1,10-phenanthroline molecules with alkyl- or aralkylhalides was carried out. the susceptibility of gram-positive (streptococcus agalactiae and staphylococcus aureus) and gram-negative (e. coli, salmonella cholerae suis, salmonella enteridis gartneri) microorganisms to synthesized quaternary ammonium  salts by disc difussion method has been detected. the bacteriostatic action of 0.5-1% solutions of all compounds was assessed in comparison with benzalkonium chloride. it was shown, that the most effectiveness against all strains is possessed by quaternary hexamethylenetetramine ammonium salts, and especially salts, containing 1-propynyl- or hydroxycarbamoylmethyl radicals. the action of these two compounds against salmonella and streptococcus was stronger than the action of benzalkonium chloride. susceptibility of pseudomonas aeruginosa to these compounds were detected. it was shown, that 1% solutions of chlorides of n-(1-propynyl) hexamethylenetetramonium and n-(hydroxycarbamoylmethyl) hexamethylenetetrammonium demonstrate the same bacteriostatic action against p. aeruginosa as well as benzalkonium chloride.

TI  == biofilm bacteria: formation and comparative susceptibility to antibiotics.
AB  == the calgary biofilm device (cbd) was used to form bacterial biofilms of selected  veterinary gram-negative and gram-positive pathogenic bacteria from cattle, sheep, pigs, chicken, and turkeys. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum biofilm eradication concentration (mbec) of ampicillin, ceftiofur, cloxacillin, oxytetracycline, penicillin g, streptomycin, tetracycline, enrofloxacin, erythromycin, gentamicin, tilmicosin, and trimethoprim-sulfadoxine  for gram-positive and -negative bacteria were determined. bacterial biofilms were readily formed on the cbd under selected conditions. the biofilms consisted of micro-colonies encased in extracellular polysaccharide material. biofilms composed of arcanobacterium (actinomyces) pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus hyicus, streptococcus agalactiae, corynebacterium renale, or corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis were not killed by the antibiotics tested but  as planktonic bacteria they were sensitive at low concentrations. biofilm and planktonic streptococcus dysgalactiae and streptococcus suis were sensitive to penicillin, ceftiofur, cloxacillin, ampicillin, and oxytetracycline. planktonic escherichia coli were sensitive to enrofloxacin, gentamicin, oxytetracycline and  trimethoprim/ sulfadoxine. enrofloxacin and gentamicin were the most effective antibiotics against e. coli growing as a biofilm. salmonella spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates growing as planktonic populations were sensitive to enrofloxacin, gentamicin, ampicillin, oxytetracycline, and trimethoprim/sulfadoxine, but as a biofilm, these bacteria were only sensitive to enrofloxacin. planktonic and biofilm pasteurella multocida and mannheimia haemolytica had similar antibiotic sensitivity profiles and were sensitive to most of the antibiotics tested. the cbd provides a valuable new technology that can be used to select antibiotics that are able to kill bacteria growing as biofilms.

TI  == characterization of streptococcus suis genes encoding proteins homologous to sortase of gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == many surface proteins which are covalently linked to the cell wall of gram-positive bacteria have a consensus c-terminal motif, leu-pro-x-thr-gly (lpxtg). this sequence is cleaved, and the processed protein is attached to an amino group of a cross-bridge in the peptidoglycan by a specific enzyme called sortase. using the type strain of streptococcus suis, nctc 10234, we found five genes encoding proteins that were homologous to sortases of other bacteria and determined the nucleotide sequences of the genetic regions. one gene, designated  srta, was linked to gyra, as were the sortase and sortase-like genes of other streptococci. three genes, designated srtb, srtc, and srtd, were tandemly clustered in a different location, where there were three segments of directly repeated sequences of approximately 110 bp in close vicinity. the remaining gene, designated srte, was located separately on the chromosome with a pseudogene which may encode a transposase. the deduced amino acid sequences of the five srt proteins showed 18 to 31% identity with the sortases of streptococcus gordonii and staphylococcus aureus, except that srta of s. suis had 65% identity with that of s. gordonii. isogenic mutants deficient for srta, srtbcd, or srte were generated by allelic exchanges. the protein fraction which was released from partially purified cell walls by digestion with n-acetylmuramidase was profiled by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. more than 15 of the protein spots were missing in the profile of the srta mutant compared with that of the parent strain, and this phenotype was completely complemented by srta cloned from s. suis. four genes encoding proteins corresponding to such spots were identified and sequenced. the deduced translational products of the four genes possessed the lpxtg motif in their c-terminal regions. on the other hand, the protein spots that were missing in the srta mutant appeared in the profiles of the srtbcd and srte mutants. these results provide evidence that the cell wall sorting system involving srta is also present in s. suis.

TI  == development of a brucella suis specific hybridisation probe and pcr which distinguishes b. suis from brucella abortus.
AB  == a genomic library was prepared from brucella suis dna (mboi digested) and cloned  into the bamhi site of puc18. colony hybridisation using a probe prepared from purified b. suis dna labelled with alpha 32p was carried out to identify colonies of interest. about 20 colonies, which gave an intense signal upon hybridisation with whole b. suis genomic dna as a probe, were selected. because of the high degree of dna homology between b. suis and brucella abortus, a short probe was chosen as it would more likely give species specificity. of seven fragments selected to probe whole b. suis, b. abortus, and yersinia enterocolitica dna, one was found to hybridise with b. suis only. the probe was sequenced in two directions and sense and anti sense primers of 25bp in length were chosen to yield a product of 421bp. after optimisation of the pcr, a product of 420bp was obtained with b. suis template dna and two bands of 420 and 650bp were detected with b. abortus template dna. this is the first reported pcr of the brucella genome where a single pair of primers will discriminate between b. suis and b. abortus. no band was observed when the two primers were used to amplify e. coli,  y. enterocolitica, enterobacter cloacae, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus uberis, corynebacterium bovis, or serratia marcescens template dna.

TI  == species selectivity of new siderophore-drug conjugates that use specific iron uptake for entry into bacteria.
AB  == siderophores selectively bind ferric iron and are involved in receptor-specific iron transport into bacteria. several types of siderophores were synthesized, and growth-promoting or inhibitory activities when they were conjugated to carbacephalosporin, erythromycylamine, or nalidixic acid were investigated. overall, 11 types of siderophores and 21 drug conjugates were tested against seven different bacterial species: escherichia coli, bordetella bronchiseptica, pasteurella multocida, pasteurella haemolytica, streptococcus suis, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis. in some species, the inhibitory activities of the drug conjugates were associated with the ability of  the bacteria to use the siderophore portion of the molecules for growth promotion in disc diffusion tests (0.04 mumol of conjugate or siderophore per disc). e. coli used catechol-based siderophore portions as well as hydroxamate-based tri-delta-oh-n-oh-delta-n-acetyl-l-ornithine ferric iron ligands for growth under iron-restricted conditions achieved by supplemental ethylenediamine di (o-hydroxyphenylacetic acid) (100 micrograms/ml) and was sensitive to carbacephalosporin conjugated to these siderophore types (up to a 34-mm-diameter  inhibition zone). b. bronchiseptica used desferrioxamine b and an isocyanurate-based or trihydroxamate in addition to catechol-based siderophore portions for promotion but was not inhibited by beta-lactam conjugates partly because of the presence of beta-lactamase. p. multocida and p. haemolytica did not use any of the synthetic siderophores for growth promotion, and the inhibitory activities of some conjugates seemed partly linked to their ability to withhold iron from these bacteria, since individual siderophore portions showed some antibacterial effects. individual siderophores did not promote s. suis growth in restrictive conditions, but the type of ferric iron ligands attached to beta-lactams affected inhibitory activities. the antibacterial activities of the  intracellular-acting agents erythromycylamine and nalidixic acid were reduced or  lost, even against s. aureus and s. epidermidis, when the agents were conjugated  to siderophores. conjugate-resistant e. coli mutants showed the absence of some iron-regulated outer membrane proteins in gel electrophoresis profiles and in specific phage or colicin sensitivity tests, implying that the drugs used outer membrane receptors of ferric complexes to get into cells.

AB  == a novel antimicrobial agent from staphylococcus aureus ksi1829, designated bac1829, was purified by sequential steps of ammonium sulfate precipitation, sephadex g-50 gel filtration chromatography, and hydrophobic interaction chromatography. purified bac1829 has a molecular mass of 6,418 +/- 2 da. the peptide in heat stable, since full biological activity is retained after heating  at 95 degrees c for 15 min, and it is destroyed by digestion with proteases. amino acid sequence analysis revealed a high concentration of ala and gly residues, which respectively comprised 24 and 19% of the total amino acid content. additionally, high levels of hydrophobic amino acids were present, accounting for the hydrophobic nature of bac1829. purified bac1829 killed exponentially growing corynebacterium renale in a dose-dependent manner by a bactericidal mode of action. a partial inhibitory spectrum analysis revealed that the following organisms were sensitive to the inhibitory activity of bac1829: s.  aureus rn4220, streptococcus suis, corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis, c. renale, corynebacterium diptheriae, haemophilus parasuis, bordetella pertussis, bordetella bronchoseptica, moraxella bovis, and pasteurella multocida.

TI  == enhancement of host resistance to bacterial infections in normal and immunosuppressed mice with actinobacillus suis.
AB  == a single intraperitoneal (ip) inoculation of heat-killed actinobacillus suis atcc 15,557 (as 15,557) into normal and immunosuppressed (dexamethasone-treated) mice  led to remarkable nonspecific resistance to ip challenge with lethal doses of opportunistic pathogens such as pseudomonas aeruginosa, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and candida albicans. the duration of this enhanced protective action and the minimal effective dose, in normal mice, induced by as 15,557 were superior to those induced by other bacterial immunostimulants such as heat-killed lavtobacillus casei yit 9018 (lc 9018) and penicillin-treated streptococcus pyogenes, su (ok-432). in immunosuppressed mice; the reduced in vivo killing activity of peritoneal exudate cells (pecs) against p. aeruginosa infection was markedly augmented by ip injection of as 15,557. the degree of pec  augmentation induced by as 15,557 was higher than that induced by lc 9018 or by ok-432. the toxicity and histopathological changes associated with as 15557 were  very low, as compared with those by produced by lc 9018 and ok-432. the results suggest that as 15,557, which showed a strong resistance-enhancing capacity against opportunistic bacterial infections, may be a useful bacterial immunostimulant.

TI  == detection of immunoglobulin-g-binding proteins in streptococcus suis.
AB  == this study was undertaken to search for the presence of immunoglobulin g (igg)-binding proteins in streptococcus suis, an important swine pathogen. whole  bacterial cells were incubated with human or pig igg conjugated to gold particles and examined by transmission electron microscopy. cells of some s. suis strains were labelled as were cells of the positive control strain, staphylococcus aureus cowan i. binding of pig and human igg to five different bacterial species of group d streptococci, to reference strains representing the 29 capsular types of  s. suis, and to 12 s. suis capsular type 2 strains was then examined using western blotting. all strains interacted with pig and human igg, although the binding profiles were slightly different. a 52 kda protein was observed in all capsular types of s. suis. this protein, absent in other group d streptococcal species, was observed in all capsular type 2 isolates originating from diseased or clinically healthy pigs, and was shown to bind human igg-fc fragments. the igg-binding activity was also observed in the culture supernatant and was sensitive to proteolysis.

TI  == use of polyvalent coagglutination reagents for serotyping of streptococcus suis.
AB  == polyvalent coagglutination reagents (prs) have been evaluated for the serotyping  of streptococcus suis. monovalent antisera produced against 28 s. suis reference  strains have been grouped to obtain five different pools. a total of 249 field isolates previously identified and belonging to different serotypes were tested with prs prepared by two different procedures: (i) monovalent coagglutination reagents were individually prepared and mixed in equal proportions, and (ii) antisera were mixed in equal proportions before the addition of the staphylococcus aureus suspension. only antisera tested by a tube agglutination test with 2-mercaptoethanol and presenting titers of 1:32 or higher were used. results obtained with prs prepared by both procedures were similar, and there was a very good correlation between the capsular type of the isolate and the reaction obtained with prs. thus, from a practical viewpoint, it is suggested that prs be  prepared by the first procedure. to isolates, were tested in parallel with both the prs and the monovalent coagglutination reagents over a 1-year period. ninety-nine percent of the typeable and all of the untypeable isolates were correctly identified. serotyping with prs is suggested to be a very useful and reliable screening procedure, particularly when a large number of s. suis isolates have to be serotyped. in addition, the choice of antisera to be included in a given pool is facultative and should be oriented to the needs of a region or a country.

TI  == cloning and nucleotide sequence of the gene encoding the 136-kilodalton surface protein (muramidase-released protein) of streptococcus suis type 2.
AB  == we cloned and sequenced the gene encoding the muramidase-released protein (mrp) of a pathogenic streptococcus suis type 2 strain to determine whether its amino acid sequence resembles that of proteins with known functions and to determine its function in virulence. the complete nucleotide sequence composing the gene and the regions flanking it was determined. the deduced amino acid sequence revealed the presence of a signal peptide at the n terminus and a cell envelope anchor at the c terminus, both of which resembled similar regions in several other surface proteins from gram-positive bacteria. the processed form of mrp has a length of 1,209 amino acids and a calculated molecular weight of 131,094. a highly repetitive region preceded the envelope anchor. the repeated units were preceded by a proline-rich stretch of amino acids (26 of 86). no overall homologies were observed between the amino acid sequence of mrp and protein sequences in the embl data bank. a particular region within the amino acid sequence, however, showed some similarity with the fibronectin-binding protein of staphylococcus aureus. binding of mrp to human fibronectin, however, could not be confirmed.

TI  == kill kinetics of the cephalosporin antibiotics cephalexin and cefuroxime against  bacteria of veterinary importance.
AB  == kill kinetic studies for two cephalosporin antibiotics, cephalexin and cefuroxime were carried out against veterinary strains of escherichia coli, pasteurella multocida, streptococcus suis, erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae and a laboratory culture of staphylococcus aureus. in more than 90 per cent of cases a kill of more than 99 per cent was achieved within four hours of antibiotic treatment at concentrations of 2 or 4 micrograms/ml. although cefuroxime was effective at lower concentrations than cephalexin the rates of kill of the two antibiotics were comparable. the results are discussed in relation to in vivo dosage regimens.
