in vitro bactericidal effects of 625, 525, and 425 nm wavelength (red, green, and blue) light-emitting diode irradiation.
objective: the purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship of 625, 525, and 425 nm wavelengths, providing average power output and effects on three common pathogenic bacteria. background data: ultraviolet (uv) light kills bacteria, but the bactericidal effects of uv may not be unique, as 425 nm produces a similar effect. the bactericidal effects of light-emitting diode (led) wavelengths such as 625 and 525 nm have not been described. before conducting clinical trials, the appropriate wavelength with reasonable dose and exposure time should be established. materials and methods: the bactericidal effects of 625, 525, and 425 nm wavelength led irradiation were investigated in vitro for the anaerobic bacterium porphyromonas gingivalis and two aerobes (staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli dh5alpha). average power output was 6 mw/cm(2) for 1 h. the bacteria were exposed to led irradiation for 1, 2, 4, and 8 h (21.6, 43.2, 86.4, and 172.8 j/cm(2), respectively). led irradiation was performed during growth on agar and in broth. control bacteria were incubated without led irradiation. bacterial growth was expressed in colony-forming units (cfu) and at an optical density at 600 nm in agar and broth. results: the bactericidal effect of led phototherapy depended upon wavelength, power density, bacterial viable number, and bacteria species. the bactericidal effect of 425 and 525 nm irradiation varied depending upon the bacterial inoculation, compared with unirradiated samples and samples irradiated with red light. especially, p. gingivalis and e. coli dh5alpha were killed by 425 nm, and s. aureus growth was inhibited by 525 nm. however, the wavelength of 625 nm was not bactericidal for p. gingivalis, e. coli dh5alpha, or s. aureus. conclusions: irradiation at 625 nm light was not bactericidal to s. aureus, e. coli, and p. gingivalis, whereas wavelengths of 425 and 525 nm had bactericidal effects. s. aureus was also killed at 525 nm.
endotoxin tolerance induced by lipopolysaccharides derived from porphyromonas gingivalis and escherichia coli: alternations in toll-like receptor 2 and 4 signaling pathway.
periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease induced by bacteria. exposure of  the host to periodontal pathogens and their virulence factors induces a hyporesponsive state to subsequent challenge, which is termed endotoxin tolerance. in this experiment, we studied the cytokine production in thp-1 cells upon single or repeated porphyromonas gingivalis (p. gingivalis) lipopolysaccharide (lps) or escherichia coli (e. coli) lps stimulation by elisa. in addition, the protein expression profiles of toll-like receptor 2 (tlr2), tlr4, il-1 receptor-associated kinase 4 (irak4) and irak-m and the gene expression changes of toll-interacting protein (tollip) and suppressor of cytokine-signaling-1 (socs1) were explored to identify possible mechanisms for changes in cytokine secretion. after repeated stimulation with p. gingivalis lps or e. coli lps, secretions of tnf-alpha and il-1beta were decreased significantly compared with those following single challenge, while the levels of il-10 were increased (p < 0.05). only comparable levels of il-8 were confirmed in p. gingivalis lps-tolerized cells (p > 0.05). in addition, severe downregulation of tlr2 was detected in thp-1 cells retreated with p. gingivalis lps, and the reduction of tlr4 expression was observed in cells restimulated with e. coli lps (p < 0.05). precondition with p. gingivalis lps or e. coli lps also led to an enhancement of irak-m and socs1, while maintaining the expressions of irak4 and tollip. this pattern of cytokine production indicates the different effects of endotoxin tolerance triggered by p. gingivalis lps and e. coli lps, which might contribute to limiting inflammatory damage. moreover, tlr2, tlr4, irak-m, and socs1 might play important roles in developing tolerance.
[cloning of the glyceraldehydes 3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene of porphyromonas gingivalis and its expression in e. coli].
objective: to clone the glyceraldehydes 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh) gene of porphyromonas gingivalis (p. gingivalis) and to induce its fusion expression in e. coli. methods: gapdh was obtained by pcr and was inserted into cloning vector pmd-18-t to construct clone recon. double enzymes digest the recon pmd18-t-gapdh and the prokaryotic expression vector pet-32a and then connect to get the expressing recon pet-32a-gapdh. the recombinant expression plasmid which had been confirmed by enzymes digestion was transformed to e. coli competent cells bl21 and induced the expression of gapdh with isopropyl beta-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (iptg) of different density. results: dna sequencing showed that the fragment was 99.802% the same to the sequence published in ncbi. under the best density, iptg could be highly expressed. conclusion: the gapdh had been successfully cloned and expressed in e. coli which gets ready for the following experiment to study the immunity of gapdh and the homologues antibody preparation.
transcriptional regulation of bone sialoprotein gene by porphyromonas gingivalis  lipopolysaccharide.
lipopolysaccharide (lps) is a major mediator of inflammatory response. periodontopathic bacterium porphyromonas gingivalis lps has quite different character from escherichia coli lps. e. coli lps is agonist for toll-like receptor 4 (tlr4), whereas p. gingivalis lps worked as antagonist for tlr4. bone sialoprotein (bsp) is an early marker of osteoblast differentiation. to investigate the effects of p. gingivalis lps on bsp transcription, we used rat osteoblast-like ros17/2.8 cells. bsp mrna levels were decreased by 0.1 microg/ml and increased by 0.01 microg/ml p. gingivalis lps at 12 h. results of luciferase assays showed that 0.1 microg/ml decreased and 0.01 microg/ml p. gingivalis lps increased bsp transcription in -116 to +60 bsp construct. the effects of p. gingivalis lps were abrogated by double mutations in camp response element (cre) and fgf2 response element (fre). tyrosine kinase inhibitor herbimycin a, erk1/2 inhibitor and antioxidant n-acetylcystein inhibited effects of p. gingivalis lps. protein kinase a inhibitor and pi3-kinase/akt inhibitor only abolished the effect of 0.01 microg/ml p. gingivalis lps. furthermore, 0.1 microg/ml lps decreased the cre- and fre-protein complexes formation, whereas 0.01 microg/ml p. gingivalis lps increased the nuclear protein binding to cre and fre. chip assays revealed increased binding of creb1, jund, fra2, runx2, dlx5, and smad1 to a chromatin fragment containing the cre and fre by 0.01 microg/ml p. gingivalis lps. these studies therefore indicated that 0.1 microg/ml suppressed, and 0.01 microg/ml p. gingivalis lps increased bsp gene transcription mediated through cre and fre elements in the rat bsp gene promoter.
[cloning of the fima gene of porphyromonas gingivalis and its expression and purification in escherichia coli].
objective; to clone the fima gene of porphyromonas gingivalis (p. gingivalis) and detect its expression in escherichia coli (e. coli). methods: the fima gene was obtained by pcr from the genome of p. gingivalis to construct a prokaryotic expression plasmid pt-bad/fima. pt-bad/fima was transformed into e. coli bl21 (de3) competent cells and the recombination protein was characterized by means of matrix assisted laser desorption ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof-ms) analysis. the bound protein was eluted with different concentrations of imidazole (250, 200, 150, 100, 50 micromol x l(-1)) respectively. results: dna sequencing showed that the fragment was 99.9% consistent with that of the published. after induction with l-arabinose, a new 3.8 x 10(4) protein appeared on sds-page gel. the protein was further identified by maldi-tof-ms. purity of 95% of the target protein was purified by ni-nta purification system after eluted with 100 micromol x l(-1) imidazole. conclusion: the fima gene of p. gingivalis was cloned successfully and its protein was expressed correctly in e. coli. a high purity of protein fima was obtained and it could be applied for follow-up researches.
neutralization of toxic haem by porphyromonas gingivalis haemoglobin receptor.
free haem is known to be toxic to organs, tissues and cells. it enhances permeability by binding to a cell membrane, which leads to cell death, and damages lipids, proteins and dna through the generation of reactive oxygen species. lysine- and arginine-specific gingipains (kgp and rgpa/b) are major proteinases that play an important role in the pathogenicity of a black-pigmented periodontopathogen named porphyromonas gingivalis. one of the adhesin domains of gingipain, hbr could bind haem as an iron nutrient source for p. gingivalis. using erythrocyte and its membrane as a model, results from the present study demonstrate that recombinant hbr expressed in escherichia coli could inhibit haem-induced haemolysis, probably through removing haem from the haem-membrane complex and lowering free haem toxicity by mediating dimerization of haem molecules. the ability to protect a cell membrane from haem toxicity is a new function for hbr.
[characterization and antibacterial effect of ag-nha-ntio2/polyamide 66 nanocomposite membrane on oral bacteria].
objective: undried silver-hydroxyapatite-titania (ag-nha-ntio2) nanoparticles slurry was used to make membrane with polyamide 66 (pa66) by co-polymerization method. the purpose of this study is to test the physical and chemical characteristics and antibacterial ability. methods: the morphology, chemical components and structures of the membrane were characterized by atomic absorption spectrometer (aas), x-ray diffraction (xrd), scanning electron microscope (sem) and energy-dispersive x-ray analysis (edx). staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus), escherichia coli (e. coli), porphyromonas gingivalis (p. gingivalis), fusobacterium nucleatum (f. nucleatum) and streptococcus mutans (s. mutans) were utilized to test the antibacterial effect. results: xrd results demonstrated that the membrane have characteristic diffraction peaks of pure hydroxyapatite (ha). a homogeneous distribution of the ca, p, ti and ag element in the membrane was confirmed by edx. both surface and section showed porous structure which was confirmed by sem and the average hole size was 20-30 microm. the bacteria assay reflected to the antibacterial effect, 50.10% of s. aureus and 56.31% of e. coli were killed. however, 91.84% of p. gingivalis, 90.64% of f. nucleatum and 90.49% of s. mutans were killed and pictures of sem showed obviously fewer cells on the surface. conclusion: the nanocomposite membrane could be one of the bioactive materials with antibacterial properties for oral guided bone regeneration technique.
[cloning of the rgpacd gene of porphyromonas gingivalis and its expression in e.  coli].
objective: to clone the catalytic domain gene sequence of rgpacd of porphyromonas gingivalis (p. gingivalis) and to induce its fusion expression in e. coli. methods: the desired dna fragment rgpacd was obtained by pcr and was separately sequenced and identified by inserting into inter-vector pmd18-t vector. the correctly fragment was linked with and cloned into a prokaryotic expression vector pet-15b. the recombinant expression plasmid which had been confirmed by enzymes digestion was transformed to e. coli competent cells bl21 (de3) and expression of fusion protein was induced by iptg. results: a 1 476 bp specific fragment was obtained and dna sequencing showed that the fragment was consistent with those of the published. after induction with iptg, a fusion protein of 5 x 10(4) was visualized on sds-page gel. conclusion: the protein of rgpacd will be obtained for further study and its protein was correctly expressed in e. coli bl21 cells.
antagonistic lipopolysaccharides block e. coli lipopolysaccharide function at human tlr4 via interaction with the human md-2 lipopolysaccharide binding site.
lipopolysaccharides containing underacylated lipid a structures exhibit reduced abilities to activate the human (h) toll-like receptor 4 (tlr4) signalling pathway and function as potent antagonists against lipopolysaccharides bearing canonical lipid a structures. expression of underacylated lipopolysaccharides has emerged as a novel mechanism utilized by microbial pathogens to modulate host innate immune responses. notably, antagonistic lipopolysaccharides are prime therapeutic candidates for combating gram negative bacterial sepsis. penta-acylated msbb and tetra-acylated porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharides functionally antagonize hexa-acylated escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide-dependent activation of htlr4 through the coreceptor, hmd-2. here, the molecular mechanism by which these antagonistic lipopolysaccharides act at hmd-2 is examined. we present evidence that both msbb and p. gingivalis lipopolysaccharides are capable of direct binding to hmd-2. these antagonistic lipopolysaccharides can utilize at least two distinct mechanisms to block e. coli lipopolysaccharide-dependent activation of htlr4. the main mechanism consists of direct competition between the antagonistic lipopolysaccharides and e. coli lipopolysaccharide for the same binding site on hmd-2, while the secondary mechanism involves the ability of antagonistic lipopolysaccharide-hmd-2 complexes to inhibit e. coli lipopolysaccharide-hmd-2 complexes function at htlr4. it is also shown that both htlr4 and hmd-2 contribute to the species-specific recognition of msbb and p. gingivalis lipopolysaccharides as antagonists at the htlr4 complex.
hierarchical gene expression profiles of huvec stimulated by different lipid a structures obtained from porphyromonas gingivalis and escherichia coli.
the ability of lipid a structural variants to elicit unique endothelial cell gene expression was examined by measuring global gene expression profiles in human umbilical cord vein endothelial cells (huvec) using affymetrix full genome chips. two lipid a structural variants obtained from porphyromonas gingivalis designated pglps(1435/1449) and pglps(1690) as well as lps obtained from escherichia coli wild type and an e. coli msbb mutant (missing myristic acid in the lipid a) were examined. each of these lipid a structures has been shown to interact with tlr4; however, pglps(1435/1449) and e. coli msbb lps have been shown to be tlr4 antagonists while pglps(1690) and wild-type e. coli lps are tlr4 agonists. it was found that pglps(1435/1449) and pglps(1690) as well as e. coli msbb lps activated a subset of those genes significantly transcribed in response to e. coli wild-type lps. furthermore, the subset of genes expressed in response to the different lipid a structural forms were those most significantly activated by wild-type e. coli lps demonstrating a hierarchy in tlr4-dependent endothelial cell gene activation. a unique gene expression profile for the weak tlr4 agonist pglps(1690) was observed and represents a tlr4 hierarchy in endothelial cell gene activation.
cutting edge: asc mediates the induction of multiple cytokines by porphyromonas gingivalis via caspase-1-dependent and -independent pathways.
porphyromonas gingivalis (pg) is a major etiologic agent for chronic periodontitis. tissue destruction by pg results partly from induction of host inflammatory responses through tlr2 signaling. this work examines the role of apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase-recruitment domain (asc), an adaptor molecule important for tlr-mediated caspase-1 activation. results demonstrate that asc levels are stable upon infection of human thp1 monocytic cells with pg but decrease after cytokine induction. using short hairpin rna, we demonstrate an essential role for asc in induction of il-1beta by tlr2, 4, and 5 agonists, live escherichia coli, and pg. induction of il-6, il-8, il-10, and tnf also requires asc, but this induction is not inhibited by il-1 receptor antagonist or caspase-1 inhibitor. similar results in u937 indicate broad applicability of these findings. pg-infected asc knockdown thp1 cells exhibit reduced transcript levels and nf-kappab activation. these results suggest a role for asc in cytokine induction by pg involving both caspase-1-dependent and -independent mechanisms.
pivotal advance: vasoactive intestinal peptide inhibits up-regulation of human monocyte tlr2 and tlr4 by lps and differentiation of monocytes to macrophages.
vasoactive intestinal peptide (vip) is an immunoregulatory peptide, which inhibits lps-induced cytokine secretion in myeloid cells and has beneficial effects in animal models of inflammatory diseases. we show for the first time that vip decreases lps-induced up-regulation of tlr2 and tlr4 by human monocytic thp1 cells and peripheral blood monocytes (pbm). vip inhibited up-regulation of tlr4 expression in thp1 cells in response to lps from escherichia coli or the periodontal pathogen porphyromonas gingivalis within 6 h poststimulation but had less of an effect on tlr2. after 24 h, p. gingivalis lps-stimulated monocytic thp1 cells to differentiate into macrophages, which predominantly expressed tlr2, and e. coli lps-stimulated thp1 differentiation to predominantly tlr4-expressing macrophages. vip decreased monocyte differentiation to macrophages induced by lps from either species and also reduced overall tlr2 and tlr4 expression in these cells. vip had a similar effect on human pbm. the transcription factor pu.1 regulates tlr expression and has a central role in myeloid cell differentiation. vip inhibited the nuclear translocation of pu.1 in lps-stimulated thp-1 monocytes. vip also inhibited the expression of the m-csf receptor, which is regulated by pu.1. in summary, vip inhibited lps-induced differentiation of monocytes with a concomitant reduction in tlr2 and tlr4 expression. although there was differential induction of tlr expression by lps from p. gingivalis and e. coli, vip inhibited the action of both of these lps types on monocytes. the mechanism of action of vip on monocyte differentiation may be via inhibition of the transcription factor pu.1.
effect of muc7 peptides on the growth of bacteria and on streptococcus mutans biofilm.
objectives: to investigate the susceptibility of selected bacteria as well as streptococcus mutans biofilm to muc7 peptides and compare the activities with those of other known antimicrobial peptides. methods: mic and mbc of peptides for s. mutans, escherichia coli, streptococcus gordonii, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa were determined using the microdilution method. for s. mutans, the effects of the peptides on the kinetics of growth inhibition, time-killing, and on biofilm formation and reduction were also examined. for biofilm studies, polystyrene microtitre plates, calgary biofilm device (cbd) and hydroxylapatite (ha) discs, along with crystal violet and alamar blue dyes, and/or em observations, were employed. results: s. mutans was the most susceptible to all peptides tested (mics of 9.4-25.0 microm), compared with the other species (mics of 3.1->100 microm). muc7 peptides (except muc7-12-mer-l4) exerted 2-fold higher activity against s. mutans than hsn5-12-mer and magainin-ii, and faster killing of s. mutans than hsn5-12-mer. the muc7 peptides also had an effect on s. mutans biofilm. on the polystyrene plates, they suppressed the biofilm formation, with mbic(50) of 6.25-12.5 microm, and reduced the 1 day developed biofilm in a batch culture, with mbrc(50) of 25-50 microm. on the cbd pegs, the viabilities of the biofilm were suppressed by >95% in the presence of muc7 peptides at 4x mic (50 microm). one day developed biofilm viabilities were inhibited by 49-75%. on ha, the formation of biofilm (as observed by em) was also considerably reduced. conclusions: muc7 peptides present somewhat preferential antimicrobial activity against s. mutans. they also have an effect on in vitro formation and reduction of the preformed s. mutans biofilm.
sensitization of human aortic endothelial cells to lipopolysaccharide via regulation of toll-like receptor 4 by bacterial fimbria-dependent invasion.
toll-like receptors (tlrs) are differentially up-regulated in response to microbial infection and chronic inflammatory diseases such as atherosclerosis. epidemiological data support the idea that periodontal disease may be a risk factor for acceleration of atherosclerosis. porphyromonas gingivalis, the etiological agent of periodontal disease, invades endothelium, has been detected in human atheromatous tissue, and accelerates atheroma formation in apolipoprotein e-/- mice with concurrent induction of tlrs in the aorta. as endothelial cells can present antigen via tlrs and play an important role in the development of atherosclerosis, we examined tlr expression in human aortic endothelial cells (haec) cultured with wild-type p. gingivalis, a fimbria-deficient mutant, and purified antigens. we observed increased tlr expression in haec infected with wild-type p. gingivalis by fluorescence-activated cell sorter, but not with noninvasive, fimbria-deficient mutant or purified p. gingivalis antigens. following a wild-type p. gingivalis challenge, functional tlr2 and tlr4 activation was assessed by subsequent stimulation with tlr agonists staphylococcus aureus lipoteichoic acid (slta; tlr2 ligand) and escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (lps; tlr4 ligand). unchallenged haec failed to elicit monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (mcp-1) in response to lps or slta but did so when cultured with wild-type p. gingivalis. p. gingivalis-induced tlr2 and -4 expression on haec functionally reacted to slta and e. coli lps as measured by a further increase in mcp-1 production. furthermore, mcp-1 expression elicited by e. coli lps was inhibitable with tlr4-specific antibody and polymyxin b. these results indicate that invasive p. gingivalis stimulates tlr expression on the surface of endothelium and these primed cells respond to defined tlr-specific ligands.
lactoferrampin: a novel antimicrobial peptide in the n1-domain of bovine lactoferrin.
the antimicrobial activity of bovine lactoferrin is attributed to lactoferricin,  situated in the n1-domain. based on common features of antimicrobial peptides, a second putative antimicrobial domain was identified in the n1-domain of lactoferrin, designated lactoferrampin. this novel peptide exhibited candidacidal activity, which was substantially higher than the activity of lactoferrin. furthermore, lactoferrampin was active against bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, but not against the fermenting bacteria actinomyces naeslundii, porphyromonas gingivalis, streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sanguis. notably, lactoferrampin is located in the n1-domain in close proximity to lactoferricin, which plays a crucial role in membrane-mediated activities of lactoferrin.
expression of cd73/ecto-5'-nucleotidase on human gingival fibroblasts and contribution to the inhibition of interleukin-1alpha-induced granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor production.
background and objectives: cd73/5'-nucleotidase (5'-nt) is an ectoenzyme that participates in immune/inflammatory reactions. we examined the possible expression of cd73/5'-nt on human gingival fibroblasts (hgf), which are important to the immune/inflammatory system in periodontal tissue. methods and results: we demonstrated that cd73/5'-nt was expressed on hgf by flow cytometry. we found that pre-treatment of hgf with 5'-amp induced marked inhibition of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (gm-csf) production from hgf upon stimulation with interleukin-1alpha (il-1alpha) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). a specific inhibitor of 5'-nt, adenosine 5'-[alpha,beta-methylene] diphosphate blocked the inhibition of gm-csf production, suggesting that adenosine converted from 5'-amp acts on the inhibitory effects. the gm-csf inhibition suggested that a3 receptor might be involved. the rank order of agonists was found to be (n6-benzyl-5'-n-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine) a3 receptor agonist > or = (2-chloroadenosine) non-selective agonist > (cgs-21680) a2a receptor agonist > adenosine > or = (n6-cyclohexyladenosine) a1 agonist. further support for the main role of a3 receptor was the binding a3 antagonist [9-chloro-2-(2-furanyl)-5-([phenylacetyl]amino)[1,2,4]-triazolo[1,5-c]quinazdine] reversed the effect of adenosine, but no significant reverse was observed by a1 (1,3-dipropyl-8-cyclopentylxanthine), a2 [3,7-dimethyl-1-(2-propargyl)xanthine], a2a[8-(3-chlorostyryl)caffeine], and a2b (alloxazine) antagonists. the cd73/5'-nt expression was increased upon stimulation with gamma-interferon, but not other stimulants such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha, il-4, lipopolysaccharide from porphyromonas gingivalis and escherichia coli, and fimbriae from p. gingivalis, and this increase was correlated with the enhanced gm-csf inhibition by 5'-amp but not adenosine. conclusions: these findings suggested that cd73/5'-nt on hgf exerts an anti-inflammatory effects in periodontal disease by conversion from 5'-amp to adenosine.
porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide antagonizes escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide at toll-like receptor 4 in human endothelial cells.
e. coli lipopolysaccharide (lps) induces cytokine and adhesion molecule expression via the toll-like receptor 4 (tlr4) signaling complex in human endothelial cells. in the present study, we investigated the mechanism by which porphyromonas gingivalis lps antagonizes e. coli lps-dependent activation of human endothelial cells. p. gingivalis lps at 1 micro g/ml inhibited both e. coli lps (10 ng/ml) and mycobacterium tuberculosis heat shock protein (hsp) 60.1 (10 micro g/ml) stimulation of e-selectin mrna expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (huvec) without inhibiting interleukin-1 beta (il-1beta) stimulation. p. gingivalis lps (1 micro g/ml) also blocked both e. coli lps-dependent and m. tuberculosis hsp60.1-dependent but not il-1beta-dependent activation of nf-kappab in human microvascular endothelial (hmec-1) cells, consistent with antagonism occurring upstream from the tlr/il-1 receptor adaptor protein, myd88. surprisingly, p. gingivalis lps weakly but significantly activated nf-kappab in hmec-1 cells in the absence of e. coli lps, and the p. gingivalis lps-dependent agonism was blocked by transient expression of a dominant negative murine tlr4. pretreatment of huvecs with p. gingivalis lps did not influence the ability of e. coli lps to stimulate e-selectin mrna expression. taken together, these data provide the first evidence that p. gingivalis lps-dependent antagonism of e. coli lps in human endothelial cells likely involves the ability of p. gingivalis lps to directly compete with e. coli lps at the tlr4 signaling complex.
the photobleaching of disulfonated aluminium phthalocyanine in microbial systems.
front-face illumination spectroscopic techniques were used to study photobleaching of disulfonated aluminium phthalocyanine (alpcs2) in the bacteria and yeast cells escherichia coil, porphyromonas gingivalis (gram-negative bacteria), streptococcus mutans (a gram-positive bacterium), and the yeast candida albicans. the photobleaching of alpcs2 with the microbes studied is complex, involving reactive species generated by type i and type ii processes with the rate dependent on the relative contributions of the different photobleaching mechanisms. the average rate of photobleaching of the alpcs2 monomer in the presence of both e. coli and c. albicans increases as the fluence of the illumination source decreases. the effects of oxygen and sensitiser concentration on the rate of alpcs2 photobleaching in these systems are also investigated.
cd14-mediated induction of interleukin-8 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 by a heat-resistant constituent of porphyromonas gingivalis in endothelial cells.
viable and inactivated porphyromonas gingivalis dose-dependently induced interleukin-8 (il-8) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (mcp-1) secretion in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (huvecs). the inactivated p. gingivalis, in comparison with viable bacteria, tended to enhance the production of both chemokines more strongly. the production of mcp-1 protein began increasing immediately after stimulation by p. gingivalis, and there was a nearly linear increase from 0 to 8 h of incubation, whereas il-8 production showed a linear increase between 4 and 12 h of incubation. the il-8 and mcp-1 mrna expressions in huvecs as determined by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) or quantikine mrna colorimetric quantification kits were found to be enhanced by p. gingivalis. furthermore, the time courses of il-8 and mcp-1 mrna expressions were in accordance with those of protein production. addition of polymyxin b or boiling did not weaken the stimulatory effect of p. gingivalis, which inhibited the effect of escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (e. coli lps) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha), respectively. in contrast, the induction of il-8 and mcp-1 by p. gingivalis was significantly reduced by anti-cd14 antibody. our results suggest that some heat-stable component of p. gingivalis, including lps, may be responsible for the induction of il-8 and mcp-1 in huvecs by a cd14-dependent mechanism. these effects might be involved in the accumulation and activation of neutrophils and monocytes at an early stage of the periodontal pathogenesis.
cloning and expression of a porphyromonas gingivalis gene for protoporphyrinogen  oxidase by complementation of a hemg mutant of escherichia coli.
porphyromonas gingivalis, a bacterium implicated in periodontal pathogenesis, has a growth requirement for iron protoporphyrin ix. by complementation with a p. gingivalis 381 chromosomal dna library, we were able to isolate a clone that enhanced the poor growth of a hemg mutant of escherichia coli. the dna sequence analysis of this clone revealed three open reading frames (orfs). orf3 encoded a protein of 466 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 51 695 da. the deduced amino acid sequence of the orf3 gene had significant similarity to sequences of protoporphyrinogen oxidase (ppo) from myxococcus xanthus (30% identical residues). when the orf3 gene was overexpressed in e. coli, the extract had much higher ppo activity than a control extract, and this activity was inhibited by acifluorfen, a specific inhibitor of ppo. thus, orf3 was named pghemg. furthermore, several porphyrin-related genes, including hemd, hemn and hemh, were identified in the data bases on the websites available on-line. we postulated that a porphyrin biosynthetic pathway to heme from preuroporphyrin may be conserved in p. gingivalis.
3-chloro-dl-alanine resistance by l-methionine-alpha-deamino-gamma-mercaptomethane-lyase activity.
the antibacterial agent 3-chloro-dl-alanine (3ca) is an inhibitor of peptidoglycan synthesis. fusobacterium nucleatum and porphyromonas gingivalis, the bacteria responsible for oral malodor, are shown to be resistant to 1 mm 3ca, whereas streptococcus mutans and escherichia coli are sensitive to this antibacterial agent at the same concentration. we isolated the 3ca resistance gene from f. nucleatum and showed that the gene encodes an l-methionine-alpha-deamino-gamma-mercaptomethane-lyase that catalyzes the alpha,gamma-elimination of l-methionine to produce methyl mercaptan. the enzyme also exhibits 3ca chloride-lyase (deaminating) activity. this antibacterial agent is expected to be useful for specific selection of malodorous oral bacteria producing high amounts of methyl mercaptan.
characterization of the porphyromonas gingivalis ftsz containing a novel gtpase activity.
the ftsz protein is a gtpase that is essential for cell division. we have cloned, sequenced, and expressed the ftsz (pgftsz) gene from the porphyromonas gingivalis, an oral, anaerobic, rod-shaped bacterium implicated in progressive periodontal disease. the pgftsz gene consisted of 1374 bp and coded for an acidic protein with a calculated molecular mass of 50,253 da. the deduced amino acid sequence exhibited a significant homology with e. coli ftsz (54% identical residues). like other prokaryotic ftszs, pgftsz possessed the clear motifs for gtp binding (gggtgtg) and hydrolysis (nldfadv). when pgftsz was overexpressed in e. coli, cell division was inhibited. recombinant pgftsz was purified to homogeneity and characterized. the purified pgftsz exhibited gtpase activity even in the absence of mg2+, and completely retained its activity with edta. furthermore, na+ and k+ ions inhibited its gtpase activity in a dose-dependent manner. these results suggest that pgftsz contains an atypical gtpase activity that has not been previously described.
modulation of chronic enteric infection by distant oral infection.
this investigation determined the effects of a distant oral infection (porphyromonas gingivalis) on a concurrent local enteric infection (echerichia coli). a modified murine subcutaneous tissue chamber model was used. subcutaneously implanted chambers with different microbial makeups were monitored for sloughing and their contents assayed for prostaglandin e2. bilaterally implanted chamber experiments revealed that a distant "chronic" (immunization with heat-killed organism, followed by live challenge) p. gingivalis infection offered protection against a local chronic e. coli infection, as evidenced by delaying the time for 50% of the chambers to reject from day 19 to day 25 and a statistically significant prostaglandin e2 decrease from 529.4 +/- 176.6 ng/ml to 191.5 +/- 100.9 ng/ml (p < 0.01) (mann-whitney test). an acute (live challenge only) distant p. gingivalis infection or immunization with the heat-killed organism alone had no effect on "chronic" e. coli infection in this model. these data suggest that the presence of low-grade chronic oral infection may modify the responses to other infectious challenges.
effects of porphyromonas gingivalis and escherichia coli lipopolysaccharides on mononuclear phagocytes.
the mononuclear phagocyte plays an important role in the regulation of microbe-induced inflammation, in part through its ability to secrete mediators, particularly cytokines, in response to microorganisms and their products. to evaluate the effects of the microbial flora associated with chronic adult periodontitis on cytokine induction, lipopolysaccharide (lps) from the periodontopathogen porphyromonas gingivalis was used to stimulate naive and phorbol ester-primed u937 monocytic cells, as well as elutriated human peripheral blood monocytes. we assessed the effect of this lps, in comparison to that of lps from escherichia coli, on cell proliferation, cytokine induction, and surface expression of the lps receptor cd14. p. gingivalis lps stimulated proliferation of u937 cells at concentrations of greater than 1 ng/ml, while e. coli lps inhibited proliferation. phorbol myristic acid (pma)-treated u937 cells and elutriated monocytes responded to e. coli lps activation by producing tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha) mrna and protein; however, p. gingivalis lps induced greater numbers of tnf-alpha mrna-positive cells and higher (p < 0.05) levels of protein than did e. coli lps. both cell types expressed interleukin-1 beta (il-1beta) mrna and protein in response to either lps treatment. compared with e. coli lps, p. gingivalis lps induced significantly (p < 0.05) higher numbers of il-1 mrna-positive u937 cells and elutriated monocytes, as well as production of significantly more (p < 0.05) il-1 protein by the monocytes. the pma-treated u937 cells and the monocytes produced high levels of il-1 receptor antagonist mrna and protein which were only marginally affected by the lps preparations. while e. coli lps induced expression of cd 14 on the surface of pma-primed u937 cells and monocytes, p. gingivalis lps exhibited a significantly (p < 0.05) greater ability to enhance receptor levels. our results indicate that p. gingivalis lps can activate the mononuclear phagocyte for proliferation, cytokine production, and cd14 expression, providing evidence for the potential of this bacterial component to act as a critical regulatory factor in the chronic inflammatory response associated with periodontitis.
extracts of prevotella intermedia and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans inhibit alkaline phosphatase activity in osteoblastic cells in vitro.
in order to study the effects of sonicated extracts from prevotella intermedia, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and other oral-related bacteria, as well as escherichia coli on bone formation, clone mc3t3-e1 cells, which have retained osteoblastic activity, were cultured with various bacterial extracts. the addition of the sonicated extracts from prevotella intermedia and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans decreased the alkaline phosphatase activity in a dose-dependent fashion over the concentration range of 1-1000 ng ml-1 compared with the control. by contrast, the sonicated extracts from other oral bacteria including porphyromonas gingivalis, capnocytophaga ochracea, streptococcus milleri and streptococcus sanguis, and escherichia coli did not decrease the alkaline phosphatase activity even in the presence of 100 ng ml-1 protein. the addition of prevotella intermedia and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans extracts that had been treated with heat and trypsin to the cell cultures also inhibited alkaline phosphatase activity in the cells, suggesting that inhibitory factors are not proteinaceous. polymyxin b did not change the alkaline phosphatase activity in the cells treated with the extracts from prevotella intermedia and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, suggesting that the inhibitory activity of the extracts is not lipopolysaccharide. the inhibitory effect of both extracts was observed in the molecular mass over 290 kda eluted from sephadex g-200 column. the inhibitory substances of prevotella intermedia were partially purified and showed broad band with estimated molecular weight of 170-190 kda by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. these results indicate that prevotella intermedia and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans may play an important role in inhibiting bone formation as well as in stimulating bone resorption.
host responses induced by co-infection with porphyromonas gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans in a murine model.
in this study, evidence is presented that mixed infection with the periodontal pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans results in a synergistic effect in their pathogenicity and in their ability to induce humoral and cellular host responses. balb/c mice were injected subcutaneously on the back with p. gingivalis atcc 53977, a. actinomycetemocomitans 75 or a mixture of both bacteria. samples of blood and fluid from abscesses formed at the site of injection (first degree) or distant from the injection site were collected for microbiologic analysis. serum and spleens were obtained for evaluation of humoral and cellular responses to p. gingivalis and a actinomycetemocomitans. mice injected with a. actinomycetemcomitans had first-degree lesions only, whereas mice injected with p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans had lesions at first- and second-degree sites from which both bacterial species were isolated. a serum anti-p. gingivalis response was induced in p. gingivalis-injected mice, which was higher in mice injected with p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans. this pattern was not seen in the anti-a, actinomycetemcomitans response. lymphoproliferative responses to phytohemagglutinin, escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide and p. gingivalis of spleen cells from infected mice were decreased, especially following co-infection. furthermore, co-infection of mice resulted in the greatest decrease in the number of cd5+, especially cd4+ lymphocytes.
effects of lipopolysaccharides on human dental pulp cells.
human dental pulp cells were treated with 1, 10, and 100 micrograms/ml of lipopolysaccharide (lps). the effects of treatment were examined by measurement of the dna content, protein content, and alkaline phosphatase activity of the cells. lps samples were purified from porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, and fusobacterium nucleatum isolated from root canals, and escherichia coli 0111:b4 lps was used as a positive control. at a concentration of 1 microgram/ml, none of the lpss caused any change in the production of dna or protein, whereas the amount of dna was increased at 10 micrograms/ml and inhibited at 100 micrograms/ml. protein synthesis was decreased by lpss at both 10 and 100 micrograms/ml. alkaline phosphatase activity was not changed at any concentration of lps tested.
smokeless tobacco effects on monocyte secretion of pge2 and il-1 beta.
the use of smokeless tobacco (st) products is associated with mucosal lesions, gingival recession, and attachment loss at the site of tobacco placement. monocytes/macrophages are primary producers of pge2 and il-1 beta, inflammatory mediators which are thought to play a role in the destruction of the periodontium. the purpose of this study was to determine the effect of st alone and in combination with a major stimulator of inflammation, bacterial lipopolysaccharide (lps), on monocyte secretion of these mediators. peripheral blood monocytes (pbm) were isolated by counterflow centrifugal elutriation from 15 healthy donors who were non-st users. pbm were incubated for 24 hours in rpmi 1640 containing various concentrations of st (0%, 0.005%, 0.01%, 1%) with or without 10 micrograms/ml lps (porphyromonas gingivalis lps or escherichia coli lps). of the st preparations, only 1% st resulted in pbm mediator secretion (7.7 +/- 2.0 ng/ml for pge2 and 1.3 +/- 0.2 ng/ml for il-1 beta) above that of control (unstimulated) cultures. furthermore, the combination of 1% st and lps resulted in a potentiation of pge2 release (5-fold for e. coli lps + 1% st and 10-fold for p. gingivalis lps + 1% st; p < 0.0001, one-way anova) relative to the lps preparations alone. in contrast, pbm il-1 beta release decreased more than 2-fold upon e. coli lps and 1% st exposure, relative to treatment with e. coli lps alone (p < 0.0001, one-way anova).(abstract truncated at 250 words)
