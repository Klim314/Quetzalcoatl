TI  == viral vector effects on exoenzyme c3 transferase-mediated actin disruption and on outflow facility.
AB  == purpose: purified clostridium botulinum exoenzyme c3 transferase (c3) effects on  the actin cytoskeleton in human trabecular meshwork cells (htm) and on the outflow facility response in monkey organ-cultured anterior segments (mocas) were determined in the presence or absence of viral vectors. methods: human adenovirus type 5 (adv) and feline immunodeficiency virus (fiv) vectors were produced using  kits. cell soluble purified c3 (c3cs) was purchased commercially. recombinant c3  (c3rec) cdna was overexpressed in escherichia coli and purified. the htm cells were incubated with up to 10 mug/ml c3cs or with 5 mug of c3rec and/or viral vector (multiplicity of infection [moi] = 25). cells then were fixed and stained  for actin. outflow facility in mocas was measured at baseline, 4 hours, 24 hours, and 3 to 4 days following bolus injection of adv (1.6 x 107 transducing units) and/or 2.5 mug c3rec. results: the htm cells treated for 4 hours with c3cs (all doses) or for 24 hours with c3rec developed a rounded morphology and lost stress  fibers. cells transduced with vectors alone showed no changes at any time point.  cells exposed to c3rec and cotransduced with either viral vector showed significant disruption of the actin cytoskeleton within 4 hours after exposure, which persisted at 24 hours. in mocas, the adv vector alone had no effect on outflow facility, but enhanced the response to c3rec at 4 hours. conclusions: coadministration of viral vectors enhances the ability of c3 transferase to disrupt actin stress fiber formation in htm cells and increase outflow facility in mocas. viral vectors potentially could be used to increase the bioavailability of proteins for cells that are difficult to transfect.

TI  == microbiological and physicochemical analysis of yatei (tetragonisca angustula) honey for assessing quality standards and commercialization.
AB  == due to the interest in the production and trading of yatei (tetragonisca angustula) honey in the province of misiones, argentina, in this work we assessed microbiological and physicochemical parameters in order to contribute to the elaboration of standards for quality control and promote commercialization. results showed that yatei honey samples had significantly different microbiological and physicochemical characteristics in comparison to established  quality standards for apis mellifera honey. thus, we observed that values for ph  (3.72), glucose (19.01 g/100g) and fructose (23.74 g/100g) were lower than a. mellifera quality standards, while acidity (79.42 meq/kg), moisture (24%), and mould and yeast count (my) (3.02 log cfu/g) were higher. the acid content was correlated with glucose (r2=0.75) and fructose (r2=0.68) content, and also with mould and yeast counts (r2=0.45) to a lesser extent. the incidence of microorganisms in yatei honey samples reached 42.85% and 39% for clostridium sulfite-reducers and bacillus spp., respectively. no c. botulinum or b. cereus cells were detected. enterococcus spp. and staphylococcus spp. incidence was similar (ca. 7.14%), whereas escherichia coli and salmonella spp. were not detected. we conclude that the microbiological and physicochemical properties of  yatei honey are different from those of a. mellifera honey; hence, different quality standards could be implemented to promote its commercialization.

TI  == gorilla gorilla gorilla gut: a potential reservoir of pathogenic bacteria as revealed using culturomics and molecular tools.
AB  == wild apes are considered to be the most serious reservoir and source of zoonoses. however, little data are available about the gut microbiota and pathogenic bacteria in gorillas. for this propose, a total of 48 fecal samples obtained from 21 gorilla gorilla gorilla individuals (as revealed via microsatellite analysis)  were screened for human bacterial pathogens using culturomics and molecular techniques. by applying culturomics to one index gorilla and using specific media supplemented by plants, we tested 12,800 colonies and identified 147 different bacterial species, including 5 new species. many opportunistic pathogens were isolated, including 8 frequently associated with human diseases; mycobacterium bolletii, proteus mirabilis, acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus and clostridium botulinum. the genus treponema accounted for 27.4% of the total reads identified  at the genus level via 454 pyrosequencing. using specific real-time pcr on 48 gorilla fecal samples, in addition to classical human pathogens, we also observed the fastidious bacteria bartonella spp. borrelia spp., coxiella burnetii and tropheryma whipplei in the gorilla population. we estimated that the prevalence of these pathogens vary between 4.76% and 85.7%. therefore, gorillas share many bacterial pathogens with humans suggesting that they could be a reservoir for their emergence.

TI  == holotoxin activity of botulinum neurotoxin subtype a4 originating from a nontoxigenic clostridium botulinum expression system.
AB  == clostridium botulinum subtype a4 neurotoxin (bont/a4) is naturally expressed in the dual-toxin-producing c. botulinum strain 657ba at 100x lower titers than bont/b. in this study, we describe purification of recombinant bont/a4 (rbont/a4) expressed in a nonsporulating and nontoxigenic c. botulinum expression host strain. the rbont/a4 copurified with nontoxic toxin complex components provided in trans by the expression host and was proteolytically cleaved to the active dichain form. activity of the recombinant bont/a4 in mice and in human neuronal cells was about 1,000-fold lower than that of bont/a1, and the recombinant bont/a4 was effectively neutralized by botulism heptavalent antitoxin. a previous report using recombinant truncated bont/a4 light chain (lc) expressed in escherichia coli has indicated reduced stability and activity of bont/a4 lc compared to bont/a1 lc, which was surmounted by introduction of a single-amino-acid substitution, i264r. in order to determine whether this mutation would also affect the holotoxin activity of bont/a4, a recombinant full-length bont/a4 carrying this mutation as well as a second mutation predicted to increase solubility (l260f) was produced in the clostridial expression system. comparative analyses of the in vitro, cellular, and in vivo activities of rbont/a4 and rbont/a4-l260f i264r showed 1,000-fold-lower activity than bont/a1 in both the mutated and nonmutated bont/a4. this indicates that these mutations do not alter the activity of bont/a4 holotoxin. in summary, a recombinant bont from a dual-toxin-producing strain was expressed and purified in an endogenous clostridial expression system, allowing analysis of this toxin.

TI  == production of recombinant botulism antigens: a review of expression systems.
AB  == botulism is a paralytic disease caused by intoxication with neurotoxins produced  by clostridium botulinum. despite their similar mechanism of action, the botulinum neurotoxins (bont) are classified in eight serotypes (a to h). as to veterinary medicine, the impact of this disease is essentially economic, since different species of production animals can be affected, especially by bont/c and d. in human health, botulism is feared in a possible biological warfare, what would involve mainly the bont/a, b, e and f. in both cases, the most effective way to deal with botulism is through prevention, which involves vaccination. however, the current vaccines against this disease have several drawbacks on their process of production and, besides this, can be dangerous to producers since it requires certain level of biosafety. this way, recombinant vaccines have been shown to be a great alternative for the development of vaccines against both animal and human botulism. all bonts have a 50-kda light chain (lc) and a 100-kda heavy chain (hc). the latter one presents two domains of 50 kda, called the n-terminal (hn) and c-terminal (hc) halves. among these regions, the hc alone seem to confer the proper immune response against intoxication. since innumerous  studies describe the expression of these distinct regions using different systems, strategies, and protocols, it is difficult to define the best option for a viable vaccine production. thereby, the present review describes the problematic of botulism and discusses the main advances for the viable production of vaccines for both human and veterinary medicine using recombinant antigens.

TI  == neuroprotective effects of c3 exoenzyme in excitotoxic retinopathy.
AB  == the purpose of this study is to evaluate the neuroprotective effects of c3 exoenzyme (c3) on n-methyl-d-aspartate (nmda)-induced retinopathy in rats. c3 was expressed in escherichia. coli and purified by affinity chromatography. immunofluorescence was performed in nih 3t3 cells treated with c3 to verify the cellular uptake of the protein. nmda was injected intravitreally into rat eyes with or without c3. at various time points after injection, eyes were enucleated. hematoxylin/eosin staining was performed on retina cross-sections for morphological analysis. survival and apoptosis of cells in the ganglion cell layer (gcl) were assessed by cresyl violet staining and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dutp nick end labeling (tunel) on retina flat-mounts. rhoa levels in  retina cells were evaluated by western blot to detect c3 uptake in vivo. the cellular uptake of c3 was verified by immunofluorescence. damage including a decrease in inner plexiform layer (ipl) thickness and reduction of cell density in the gcl, corresponding to apoptosis of neurons, was induced by intravitreal injection of nmda. protection against this damage was observed following co-injection of c3 and nmda. rhoa adp-ribosylation induced by c3 was confirmed by western blot. our results suggest that c3 exerts neuroprotective effects against  excitotoxic damage induced by nmda.

TI  == eutrophication and bacterial pathogens as risk factors for avian botulism outbreaks in wetlands receiving effluents from urban wastewater treatment plants.
AB  == due to the scarcity of water resources in the "mancha humeda" biosphere reserve,  the use of treated wastewater has been proposed as a solution for the conservation of natural threatened floodplain wetlands. in addition, wastewater treatment plants of many villages pour their effluent into nearby natural lakes.  we hypothesized that certain avian pathogens present in wastewater may cause avian mortalities which would trigger avian botulism outbreaks. with the aim of testing our hypothesis, 24 locations distributed in three wetlands, two that receive wastewater effluents and one serving as a control, were monitored during  a year. sediment, water, water bird feces, and invertebrates were collected for the detection of putative avian pathogenic escherichia coli (apec), salmonella spp., clostridium perfringens type a, and clostridium botulinum type c/d. also, water and sediment physicochemical properties were determined. overall, apec, c.  perfringens, and c. botulinum were significantly more prevalent in samples belonging to the wetlands which receive wastewater. the occurrence of a botulism  outbreak in one of the studied wetlands coincided with high water temperatures and sediment 5-day biochemical oxygen demand (bod5), a decrease in water redox potential, chlorophyll a, and sulfate levels, and an increase in water inorganic  carbon levels. the presence of c. botulinum in bird feces before the onset of the outbreak indicates that carrier birds exist and highlights the risk of botulinum  toxin production in their carcasses if they die by other causes such as bacterial diseases, which are more probable in wastewater wetlands.

AB  == studies on outbreaks or incidences of infectious diseases and food poisonings are the starting points in research. analyses of the outbreaks will provide the mechanism by which the illnesses occur and the establishment of countermeasure. we report here some sensational outbreaks which recently occurred in japan: 1) enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli (ehec) o157 outbreaks by pickled chinese cabbage in hokkaido, 2) ehec o157/o111 outbreaks by raw beef in toyama prefecture, 3) parasitic food poisoning due to raw olive flounder consumption in  the western japan, and 4) botulism due to the consumption of vacuum packed food in tottori prefecture.

TI  == crystallization and preliminary x-ray analysis of a novel haemagglutinin component of the toxin complex of serotype c clostridium botulinum.
AB  == the botulinum toxin complex, the causative agent of botulism, passes through the  intestinal wall via sugar-chain-dependent cell binding of a haemagglutinin of 33  kda molecular weight (ha-33). the amino-acid sequence of the c-terminal half of ha-33 of the serotype c strain yoichi (c-yoichi) shares only 46% identity with those of the major serotype c strains. additionally, c-yoichi ha-33 exhibits a unique sugar-binding specificity. in the present work, c-yoichi ha-33 was expressed in escherichia coli and crystallized. diffraction data were collected at a resolution of 2.2 a. the crystals belonged to space group r3. the complete detailed protein structure will yield insight into how the unique ha-33 protein recognizes sugar moieties.

TI  == food-borne pathogens of animal origin-diagnosis, prevention, control and their zoonotic significance: a review.
AB  == the term food borne diseases or food-borne illnesses or more commonly food poisoning are used to denote gastrointestinal complications that occur following  recent consumption of a particular food or drink. millions of people suffer worldwide every year and the situation is quiet grave in developing nations creating social and economic strain. the food borne pathogens include various bacteria viz., salmonella, campylobacter, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, yersinia enterocolitica, staphylococcus, arcobacter, clostridium perfringens, cl. botulinum and bacillus cereus and helminths viz., taenia. they also include protozoa viz., trichinella, sarcocystis, toxoplasma gondii and cryptosporidium parvum. the zoonotic potential and the ability to elaborate toxins by many of the microbes causing fatal intoxication are sufficient to understand the seriousness of the situation. the viral agents being host specific their transmission to humans through food of animal origin is not yet confirmed although these animal viruses are similar to that of viruses infecting human. food-borne bacteria; protozoa and helminthes have complex distribution pattern in the environment and inside the host system. this along with complexity of the maintenance chain and life cycle (of parasites) has made it difficult for epidemiologist and diagnostician to undertake any immediate safety measures against them. serological and molecular diagnostic tests viz. elisa, latex agglutination test, lateral flow assays, immunomagnetic separation assays, molecular assays viz. polymerase chain reaction (pcr), multiplex pcr, immuno-pcr, realtime pcr, random amplified polymorphic dna (rapd)-pcr, dna microarrays and probes are widely used. along with these lamp assays, capillary electrophoresis-single strand confirmation polymorphism (ce-sscp); flow cytometry, fish, biosensors, direct epifluorescent filter technique, nanotechnology based methods and sophisticated tools (ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging and chlonangio-pancreatography) have aided in the diagnosis greatly. most of the food-borne illnesses are self-limiting but in many instances antibiotics are recommended. with the increased drug resistance however use of chicken immunoglobulin, bacteriophage therapy, probiotics and herbs are gaining much importance these days. adoption of proper prevention and control measures (including cooking procedures; hygiene, strict adherence to haccp principles, public awareness and disease surveillance and monitoring) are the need of hour. all these have been discussed vividly in this review to help epidemiologists, diagnosticians, clinicians and above all common people so as to enable them avoid negligence regarding such serious issue.

TI  == high level expression, purification and immunogenicity analysis of a protective recombinant protein against botulinum neurotoxin type e.
AB  == botulinum neurotoxin type e heavy chain consists of two domains: n-terminal half  as a translocation domain and c-terminal half (hcc) as a binding domain. in this  research a synthetic gene fragment encoding the binding domain of botulinum neurotoxin type e (bont/e-hcc) was highly expressed in escherichia coli by pgex4t-1 vector. after purification, the recombinant bont/e-hcc was evaluated by  sds-page and western blot (immunoblot) analysis. average yields obtained in this  research were 3.7 mg recombinant bont/e-hcc per liter of bacterial culture. the recombinant protein was injected in mice for study of its protection ability against botulinum neurotoxin type e challenges. the challenge studies showed that, vaccinated mice were fully protected against 10(4) x minimum lethal dose of botulinum neurotoxin type e.

TI  == purification, crystallization and preliminary x-ray analysis of an ha17-ha70 (ha2-ha3) complex from clostridium botulinum type c progenitor toxin.
AB  == the haemagglutinin (ha) complex of clostridium botulinum type c toxin is composed of three types of subcomponents: ha33, ha17 and ha70 (also known as ha1, ha2 and  ha3, respectively). here, a 260 kda ha17-ha70 complex was crystallized. his-tagged ha17 and maltose-binding-protein-tagged ha70 were expressed in escherichia coli and their complex was affinity-purified using a combination of amylose resin chromatography and nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose chromatography. diffraction data were collected to 8.0 a resolution and the crystal belonged to the tetragonal space group p4(1)2(1)2. the molecular-replacement solution indicated that one molecule of ha17 was bound to each ha70 monomer.

TI  == inhibitions of the translocation pore of clostridium botulinum c2 toxin by tailored azolopyridinium salts protects human cells from intoxication.
AB  == c2 toxin from clostridium botulinum represents the prototype of clostridial binary actin adp-ribosylating toxins which destroy the actin-cytoskeleton of mammalian cells and cause severe enteric diseases in humans and animals. after receptor-mediated endocytosis of the c2 toxin complex, the binding/translocation  component c2iia forms a heptameric transmembrane pore in membranes of acidified endosomal vesicles. the separate adp-ribosyltransferase component c2i translocates through this c2iia-pore from the endosomal lumen into the cytosol. here we demonstrate that positively charged heterocyclic azolopyridinium salts which were developed as pore blockers for the anthrax toxins, efficiently protect cultured mammalian cells from intoxication with c2 toxin. the inhibitors had no effects on enzyme activity of c2i or receptor binding of c2 toxin but inhibited the ph-dependent membrane translocation of c2i in living cells, most likely by blocking the c2iia-translocation pores. in vitro, the substances blocked c2iia-pores in black lipid bilayer membranes when applied to the cis-side of the  membrane which corresponds to the endosomal lumen of cells. thus, heterocyclic azolopyridinium salts could represent lead compounds for development of novel therapeutics against binary clostridial toxins.

TI  == vaccination of cattle with a recombinant bivalent toxoid against botulism serotypes c and d.
AB  == cattle botulism is a fatal intoxication caused by botulinum neurotoxins (bonts) produced by clostridium botulinum serotypes c and d resulting in economic losses. vaccination is the most effective way to control botulism. however, the commercially available vaccines are difficult and hazardous to produce. neutralizing antibodies against the c-terminal fragment of the bont heavy chain (hc) are known to protect against lethal doses of bonts. we report the vaccination of cattle with a previously tested recombinant chimera consisting of  escherichia coli heat-labile enterotoxin b subunit and the hc of bonts c and d. vaccinated animals produced neutralizing antibodies against serotypes c and d averaging 5+/-0 and 6.14+/-1.06iu/ml, respectively. for bont d, the titers were greater than those measured for the commercial vaccine, which induced titers of 5+/-0 and 2.85+/-1.35 against the respective serotypes, suggesting that this chimera is effective against cattle botulism.

TI  == production and evaluation of a recombinant chimeric vaccine against clostridium botulinum neurotoxin types c and d.
AB  == bovine botulism is a fatal disease that is caused by botulinum neurotoxins (bonts) produced by clostridium botulinum serotypes c and d and that causes great economic losses, with nearly 100% lethality during outbreaks. it has also been considered a potential source of human food-borne illness in many countries. vaccination has been reported to be the most effective way to control bovine botulism. however, the commercially available toxoid-based vaccines are difficult and hazardous to produce. neutralizing antibodies targeted against the c-terminal fragment of the bont heavy chain (hc) are known to confer efficient protection against lethal doses of bonts. in this study, a novel recombinant chimera, consisting of escherichia coli heat-labile enterotoxin b subunit (ltb), a strong  adjuvant of the humoral immune response, fused to the hc of bont serotypes c and  d, was produced in e. coli. mice vaccinated with the chimera containing ltb and an equivalent molar ratio of the chimera without ltb plus aluminum hydroxide (al(oh)3) developed 2 iu/ml of antitoxins for both serotypes. guinea pigs immunized with the recombinant chimera with ltb plus al(oh)3 developed a protective immune response against both bont/c (5 iu/ml) and bont/d (10 iu/ml), as determined by a mouse neutralization bioassay with pooled sera. the results achieved with guinea pig sera fulfilled the requirements of commercial vaccines for prevention of botulism, as determined by the brazilian ministry of agriculture, livestock and food, supply. the presence of ltb was essential for the development of a strong humoral immune response, as it acted in synergism with al(oh)3. thus, the vaccine described in this study is a strong candidate for the control of botulism in cattle.

TI  == pathoscope: species identification and strain attribution with unassembled sequencing data.
AB  == emerging next-generation sequencing technologies have revolutionized the collection of genomic data for applications in bioforensics, biosurveillance, and for use in clinical settings. however, to make the most of these new data, new methodology needs to be developed that can accommodate large volumes of genetic data in a computationally efficient manner. we present a statistical framework to analyze raw next-generation sequence reads from purified or mixed environmental or targeted infected tissue samples for rapid species identification and strain attribution against a robust database of known biological agents. our method, pathoscope, capitalizes on a bayesian statistical framework that accommodates information on sequence quality, mapping quality, and provides posterior probabilities of matches to a known database of target genomes. importantly, our  approach also incorporates the possibility that multiple species can be present in the sample and considers cases when the sample species/strain is not in the reference database. furthermore, our approach can accurately discriminate between very closely related strains of the same species with very little coverage of the genome and without the need for multiple alignment steps, extensive homology searches, or genome assembly--which are time-consuming and labor-intensive steps. we demonstrate the utility of our approach on genomic data from purified and in silico "environmental" samples from known bacterial agents impacting human health for accuracy assessment and comparison with other approaches.

TI  == enhancing the protective immune response against botulism.
AB  == the need for a vaccine against botulism has increased since the discontinuation of the pentavalent (abcde) botulinum toxoid vaccine by the centers for disease control and prevention. the botulinum toxins (bonts) are the primary virulence factors and vaccine components against botulism. bonts comprise three domains which are involved in catalysis (lc), translocation (hct), and host receptor binding (hcr). recombinant hcr subunits have been used to develop the next generation of bont vaccines. using structural studies and the known entry properties of bont/a, an hcr subunit vaccine against bont/a that contained the point mutation w1266a within the ganglioside binding pocket was designed. hcr/a(w1266a) did not enter primary neurons, and the crystal structure of hcr/a(w1266a) was virtually identical to that of wild-type hcr/a. using a mouse model, experiments were performed using a high-dose vaccine and a low-dose vaccine. at a high vaccine dose, hcr/a and hcr/a(w1266a) elicited a protective immune response to bont/a challenge. at the low-dose vaccination, hcr/a(w1266a) was a more protective vaccine than hcr/a. alpha-hcr igg titers correlated with protection from bont challenge, although titers to block hcr/a entry were greater in serum in hcr/a-vaccinated mice than in hcr/a(w1266a)-vaccinated mice. this study shows that removal of receptor binding capacity enhances potency of the subunit hcr vaccine. vaccines that lack receptor binding capacity have the added  property of limited off-target toxicity.

TI  == detailed analysis of metagenome datasets obtained from biogas-producing microbial communities residing in biogas reactors does not indicate the presence of putative pathogenic microorganisms.
AB  == background: in recent years biogas plants in germany have been supposed to be involved in amplification and dissemination of pathogenic bacteria causing severe infections in humans and animals. in particular, biogas plants are discussed to contribute to the spreading of escherichia coli infections in humans or chronic botulism in cattle caused by clostridium botulinum. metagenome datasets of microbial communities from an agricultural biogas plant as well as from anaerobic lab-scale digesters operating at different temperatures and conditions were analyzed for the presence of putative pathogenic bacteria and virulence determinants by various bioinformatic approaches. results: all datasets featured  a low abundance of reads that were taxonomically assigned to the genus escherichia or further selected genera comprising pathogenic species. higher numbers of reads were taxonomically assigned to the genus clostridium. however, only very few sequences were predicted to originate from pathogenic clostridial species. moreover, mapping of metagenome reads to complete genome sequences of selected pathogenic bacteria revealed that not the pathogenic species itself, but only species that are more or less related to pathogenic ones are present in the  fermentation samples analyzed. likewise, known virulence determinants could hardly be detected. only a marginal number of reads showed similarity to sequences described in the microbial virulence database mvirdb such as those encoding protein toxins, virulence proteins or antibiotic resistance determinants. conclusions: findings of this first study of metagenomic sequence reads of biogas producing microbial communities suggest that the risk of dissemination of pathogenic bacteria by application of digestates from biogas fermentations as fertilizers is low, because obtained results do not indicate the presence of putative pathogenic microorganisms in the samples analyzed.

TI  == a recombinant fusion toxin based on enzymatic inactive c3bot1 selectively targets macrophages.
AB  == background: the c3bot1 protein (~23 kda) from clostridium botulinum adp-ribosylates and thereby inactivates rho. c3bot1 is selectively taken up into  the cytosol of monocytes/macrophages but not of other cell types such as epithelial cells or fibroblasts. most likely, the internalization occurs by a specific endocytotic pathway via acidified endosomes. methodology/principal findings: here, we tested whether enzymatic inactive c3bot1e174q serves as a macrophage-selective transport system for delivery of enzymatic active proteins into the cytosol of such cells. having confirmed that c3bot1e174q does not induce macrophage activation, we used the actin adp-ribosylating c2i ( approximately 50  kda) from clostridium botulinum as a reporter enzyme for c3bot1e174q-mediated delivery into macrophages. the recombinant c3bot1e174q-c2i fusion toxin was cloned and expressed as gst-protein in escherichia coli. purified c3bot1e174q-c2i was recognized by antibodies against c2i and c3bot and showed c2i-specific enzyme activity in vitro. when applied to cultured cells c3bot1e174q-c2i adp-ribosylated actin in the cytosol of macrophages including j774a.1 and raw264.7 cell lines as  well as primary cultured human macrophages but not of epithelial cells. together  with confocal fluorescence microscopy experiments, the biochemical data indicate  the selective uptake of a recombinant c3-fusion toxin into the cytosol of macrophages. conclusions/significance: in summary, we demonstrated that c3bot1e174q can be used as a delivery system for fast, selective and specific transport of enzymes into the cytosol of living macrophages. therefore, c3-based  fusion toxins can represent valuable molecular tools in experimental macrophage pharmacology and cell biology as well as attractive candidates to develop new therapeutic approaches against macrophage-associated diseases.

TI  == cbra is a flavin adenine dinucleotide protein that modifies the escherichia coli  outer membrane and confers specific resistance to colicin m.
AB  == colicin m (cma) is a protein toxin produced by escherichia coli that kills sensitive e. coli cells by inhibiting murein biosynthesis in the periplasm. recombinant plasmids carrying cbra (formerly yids) strongly increased resistance  of cells to cma, whereas deletion of cbra increased cma sensitivity. transcription of cbra is positively controlled by the two-component crebc system. a deltacreb mutant was highly cma sensitive because little cbra was synthesized.  treatment of cbra-overproducing cells by osmotic shock failed to render cells cma sensitive because the cells were resistant to osmotic shock. in a natural environment with a growth-limiting nutrient supply, cells producing cbra defend themselves against colicin m synthesized by competing cells. isolated cbra is a protein with noncovalently bound flavin adenine dinucleotide. sequence comparison and structure prediction assign the closest relative of cbra with a known crystal structure as digeranylgeranyl-glycerophospholipid reductase of thermoplasma acidophilum. cbra is found in escherichia coli, citrobacter, and salmonella bongori but not in other enterobacteria. the next homologs with the highest identity (over 50%) are found in the anaerobic clostridium botulinum group 1 and  a few other firmicutes.

TI  == carbohydrate recognition mechanism of ha70 from clostridium botulinum deduced from x-ray structures in complexes with sialylated oligosaccharides.
AB  == clostridium botulinum produces the botulinum neurotoxin, forming a large complex  as progenitor toxins in association with non-toxic non-hemagglutinin and/or several different hemagglutinin (ha) subcomponents, ha33, ha17 and ha70, which bind to carbohydrate of glycoproteins from epithelial cells in the infection process. to elucidate the carbohydrate recognition mechanism of ha70, x-ray structures of ha70 from type c toxin (ha70/c) in complexes with sialylated oligosaccharides were determined, and a binding assay by the glycoconjugate microarray was performed. these results suggested that ha70/c can recognize both  alpha2-3- and alpha2-6-sialylated oligosaccharides, and that it has a higher affinity for alpha2-3-sialylated oligosaccharides.

AB  == the most effective protection against toxin is inducing protective immune response through vaccination that will produce neutralizing antibodies. antibodies will bind to and clear toxin from the circulation before it can enter  nerve cells and block neurotransmission and can also be used for development of detection system. in the present study we constructed a deletion mutant of the binding domain (1098-1296) to produce smallest toxin fragment as vaccine candidate against bont/a. the bont/a-hcc protein was highly expressed in escherichia coli sg13009 and found to form inclusion bodies. the purified inclusion bodies were solubilized in 6 m guanidine-hcl containing 10 mm beta-mercaptoethanol and 20 mm imidazole and the rbont/a-hcc was purified and refolded in a single step on ni2+ affinity column. the purified protein was approximately 98 % pure as assessed by sds-polyacrylamide gel with the yield of 8 mg/l and showed binding to polysialoganglioside (gt1b). the rbont/a-hcc at dose of 40 mug/mouse generated high igg antibody titre with predominance of igg1 subtype, but failed to protect animals against bont/a challenge. antibody titre in serum was determined by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay and specific binding to rbont/a-hcc was demonstrated by surface plasmon resonance (spr), with a dissociation constant of 0.8 pm.

TI  == crystallization and preliminary x-ray analysis of the clostridium botulinum type  d nontoxic nonhaemagglutinin.
AB  == clostridium botulinum produces botulinum neurotoxin (bont) as a large toxin complex assembled with nontoxic nonhaemagglutinin (ntnha) and/or haemagglutinin components. complex formation with ntnha is considered to be critical in eliciting food poisoning because the complex shields the bont from the harsh conditions in the digestive tract. in the present study, ntnha was expressed in escherichia coli and crystallized. diffraction data were collected to 3.9 a resolution. the crystal belonged to the trigonal space group p321 or p3(1)21/p3(2)21, with unit-cell parameters a = b = 147.85, c = 229.74 a. the structure of ntnha will provide insight into the assembly mechanism that produces the unique bont-ntnha complex.

TI  == inhibition of bacterial carbonic anhydrases and zinc proteases: from orphan targets to innovative new antibiotic drugs.
AB  == zinc-containing enzymes, such as carbonic anhydrases (cas) and metalloproteases (mps) play critical functions in bacteria, being involved in various steps of their life cycle, which are important for survival, colonization, acquisition of  nutrients for growth and proliferation, facilitation of dissemination, invasion and pathogenicity. the development of resistance to many classes of clinically used antibiotics emphasizes the need of new antibacterial drug targets to be explored. there is a wealth of data regarding bacterial cas and zinc mps present  in many pathogenic species, such as neisseria spp., helycobacter pylori escherichia coli, mycobacterium tuberculosis, brucella spp., streptococcus pneumoniae, salmonella enterica, haemophilus influenzae, listeria spp, vibrio spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, legionella pneumophila, streptomyces spp., clostridium spp., enterococcus spp., etc. some of these enzymes have been cloned, purified and characterized by crystallographic techniques. however, for the moment, few potent and specific inhibitors for bacterial mps have been reported except for clostridium histolyticum collagenase, botulinum and tetanus neurotoxin and anthrax lethal factor, which will be reviewed in this article. bacteria encode alpha-,beta-, and/or gamma-ca families, but up to now only the first two classes have been investigated in some detail in different species. the alpha-cas from neisseria spp. and h. pylori as well as the beta-class enzymes from e. coli, h. pylori, m. tuberculosis, brucella spp., s. pneumoniae, s. enterica and h. influenzae have been cloned and characterized. the catalytic/inhibition mechanisms of these cas are well understood as x-ray crystal structures are available for some of them, but no adducts of these enzymes with inhibitors have  been characterized so far. in vitro and in vivo studies with various classes of inhibitors, such as anions, sulfonamides and sulfamates have been reported. only  for neisseria spp., h. pylori, b. suis and s. pneumoniae cas it has been possible to evidence inhibition of bacterial growth in vivo. thus, bacterial cas and mps represent at this moment very promising targets for obtaining antibacterials devoid of the resistance problems of the clinically used such agents but further  studies are needed to validate these and other less investigated enzymes as novel drug targets.

TI  == [the new microbiological hazards in food].
AB  == this paper describes the new microbiological hazards in food. for protecting human health, nowadays food safety authorities face with many challenges, that years ago were largely unheard. in 2011 verocytotoxigenic escherichia coli o104:h4 has been isolated in germany. strain came from fenugreek sprouts originated from egypt. it was characterized by unique features such as presence of enteroaggregative escherichia coli genes (aata, aggr, aap, agga, aggc) and resistance to most antibiotics. in poland only three cases of disease caused by o104:h4 strain have been reported. another emergence pathogen in poland is yersinia enterocolitica 08, biotype 1b. it is the most pathogenic bioserotype recently isolated in the usa only. food-borne is commonly associated with raw or  undercooked pork. the source of yersinia spp. may be also milk and water. the presence ofbotulinum neurotoxins in food is not new, but still an important issue because of their high toxicity to human. botulinum neurotoxins are high-molecular thermolabile proteins produced by clostridium botulinum and some strains of clostridium butyricum and clostridium baratii. based on their antigenic properties, botulin neurotoxins are divided into seven types a-g, however only types a, b, e and f are toxic to humans and some animals. increasing risk associated with food results from antimicrobial resistance eg. extended spectrum  beta-lactamases (esbls) producing bacteria, particularly enterobacteriaceae. until recently strains esbl+ were isolated in hospitals, however during last years they have been isolated from healthy humans, animals and food of animal origin. increasingly common microbiological hazard in food is methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa). although prevalence of this pathogen in food is not high, the thread comes from difficulties of treating of infections caused by mrsa. the occurrence of food-borne in humans may also be associated with presence of viruses in food and water. the carrier of viruses may be equipment in food plant, production line, packaging and man. most food-borne are caused by noroviruses, rotaviruses, hepatitis a virus and hepatitis e virus.  an increased number of food-borne viral outbreaks are recorded in several countries. reasons for this include the improved diagnostic methods that have enhanced detection of some virus groups, and the increased marketing of fresh and frozen foods that has led to a worldwide availability of high risk food. viruses  may contaminate food either through contamination at source, principally through  sewage pollution of the environment, or in association with food

TI  == epitope characterization of sero-specific monoclonal antibody to clostridium botulinum neurotoxin type a.
AB  == botulinum neurotoxins (bonts) are extremely potent toxins that can contaminate foods and are a public health concern. anti-bont antibodies have been described that are capable of detecting bonts; however there still exists a need for accurate and sensitive detection capabilities for bonts. herein, we describe the  characterization of a panel of eight monoclonal antibodies (mabs) generated to the non-toxic receptor-binding domain of bont/a (h(c)50/a) developed using a high-throughput screening approach. in two independent hybridoma fusions, two groups of four igg mabs were developed against recombinant h(c)50/a. of these eight, only a single mab, f90g5-3, bound to the whole bont/a protein and was characterized further. the f90g5-3 mab slightly prolonged time to death in an in  vivo mouse bioassay and was mapped by pepscan to a peptide epitope in the n-terminal subdomain of h(c)50/a (h(cn)25/a) comprising amino acid residues (985)wtlqdtqeikqrvvf(999), an epitope that is highly immunoreactive in humans. furthermore, we demonstrate that f90g5-3 binds bont/a with nanomolar efficiency.  together, our results indicate that f90g5-3 is of potential value as a diagnostic immunoreagent for bont/a capture assay development and bio-forensic analysis.

TI  == using temperature and time criteria to control the effectiveness of continuous thermal sanitation of piggery effluent in terms of set microbial indicators.
AB  == aim: to determine the minimal conditions (temperature-time), necessary to achieve set sanitation targets for selected microbial indicators during the continuous thermal treatment of pig slurry. methods and results: the effectiveness of thermal treatment between 55 and 96 degrees c was studied using escherichia coli, enterococci, sulfite-reducing clostridia (src), mesophilic culturable bacteria (mcb), f+-specific and somatic phages. identification of src and mcb was performed using 16s rrna gene analysis. ten minutes at 70 degrees c or 1 h at 60  degrees c was sufficient to reduce the vegetative bacteria by 4-5 log(10), but it had little effect on somatic phages nor on spore formers, dominated by clostridium sp. at 96 degrees c, somatic phages were still detected, but there was a reduction of 3.1 log(10) for src and of 1.4 log(10) for mcb. at 96 degrees  c, clostridium botulinum was identified among the thermotolerant mcb. conclusion: only those hygienic risks relating to mesophilic vegetative bacteria can be totally eliminated from pig slurry treated at 60 degrees c (60 min) or 70 degrees c (<10 min). significance and impact of the study: hygiene standards based on the removal of the indicators e. coli and enterococci can easily be met by treatment  as low as 60 degrees c (enabling, a low-cost treatment using heat recovery). however, even at 96 degrees c, certain pathogens may persist.

TI  == high level expression of recombinant bont/a-hc by high cell density cultivation of escherichia coli.
AB  == the carboxylic domain of the clostridium botulinum neurotoxin heavy chain (bont/a-hc), which has been reported as a vaccine candidate, contains the principle protective antigenic determinants. in this study, the high level expression of the bont/a-hc was achieved by high cell density cultivation of recombinant escherichia coli in a 2-l batch stirred-tank bioreactor. in order to  maximize protein expression, post-induction time and iptg inducer concentration were optimized by the taguchi statistical design method. results showed that the  middle of the logarithmic phase and an iptg concentration of 1 mm presented the optimum conditions for the maximum expression of bont/a-hc. high cell density cultivation was subsequently carried out as an effective strategy for the high level expression of recombinant bont/a-hc. consequently, soluble bont/a-hc was produced at the maximum level of 486 mg l(-1), at 3 h post-induction, which was approximately 9.3 and 7.8 times higher than the levels produced by the shake flask and batch culturing methods, respectively.

TI  == development of immunodetection system for botulinum neurotoxin type b using synthetic gene based recombinant protein.
AB  == background & objectives: botulinum neurotoxins (a-g) are among most poisonous substances in the world, produced by obligate anaerobic bacteria clostridium botulinum. among the seven serotypes a, b, e and f are of human importance. in india, the prevalence of c. botulinum as well as botulism outbreaks have been reported. due to its extreme toxicity it has been classified in the category a of biological warfare agent. so far, there is no commercial detection system available in india to detect botulism. the present study aims to develop an immuno detection system for botulinum neurotoxin serotype b using synthetic gene  approach. methods: the truncated fragment of the botulinum neurotoxin type b from amino acid 1-450 was synthesized using pcr overlap primers; the constructed gene  was cloned in the pqe30ua vector and transformed to escherichia coli sg 13009. the recombinant protein expression was optimized using various concentration of isopropylthiogalactoside (iptg) induction, further the expression was confirmed by western blot analysis using anti-his antibody. recombinant protein was purified under denatured condition using ni-nta affinity chromatography. antibody was generated against the recombinant protein using alum adjuvant in balb/c mice  and tested for cross reactivity with other serotypes of c. botulinum as well as closely related clostridia. an elisa test was developed for the detection of botulinum neurotoxin and the minimum detection limit was also estimated. results: the recombinant protein was expressed at maximum yield at 4.3 h of post-induction with 0.5 mm iptg concentration. the recombinant protein was purified using ni-nta affinity chromatography up to the homogeneity level. the polyclonal antibodies were raised in mice with a titre of 1:2,048,000. the developed antibody was highly specific with a sensitivity of detecting approximately 15 ng/ml of recombinant protein and not showing any cross-reactivity with other serotypes. interpretation & conclusions: there is no commercial immunodetection system available in india to detect botulism. the developed detection system is highly specific. it will be useful for growing food industry to detect botulinum neurotoxin in food samples as well as in clinical samples.

TI  == inhibition of escherichia coli o157:h7 and clostridium sporogenes in spinach packaged in modified atmospheres after treatment combined with chlorine and lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == implementation of modified atmospheric packaging (map) into retail produce is a less commonly practiced method due to differences among commodities and the potential growth of anaerobes. pathogens including escherichia coli o157:h7 have  been responsible for spinach outbreaks across the united states. in this study, hurdles, including those currently used with produce safety, such as map and chlorine, were combined with lactic acid bacteria (lab) to inhibit pathogens. spinach was coinoculated with e. coli o157:h7 and clostridium sporogenes, a surrogate for c. botulinum, and treated with water or a hurdle that included water, chlorine, and lab. spinach from treatments were packaged in air (traditional), oxygen (80% o(2), 20% co(2)), or nitrogen (80% n(2), 20% co(2)) and stored in a retail display case for 9 d at 4 to 7 degrees c. the hurdle inhibited e. coli o157:h7 and c. sporogenes compared to controls with reductions  of 1.43 and 1.10 log (p < 0.05), respectively. the nitrogen atmosphere was outperformed by air and oxygen in the reduction of e. coli o157:h7 (p < 0.05) with a decrease of 0.26 and 0.15 logs. there were no significant differences among the 3 atmospheres on c. sporogenes survival. relative to these hurdles, we  also chose to evaluate the potential benefits of lab in pathogen control. the survival of lab in interventions demonstrates implementation of lab into produce  could control pathogens, without damaging produce or altering organoleptic properties. practical application: the goal of our work was to identify methods that could reduce food-borne pathogens in packaged spinach products. using current industry techniques in combination with unique methods, such as the use of beneficial bacteria, our research identified whether harmful microorganisms could be eliminated. our data demonstrate that specific packaging conditions with beneficial bacteria can help eliminate or reduce the survival of e. coli o157:h7  and c. sporogenes (a model for c. botulinum) in produce.

TI  == inhibitory spectra and modes of antimicrobial action of gallotannins from mango kernels (mangifera indica l.).
AB  == this study investigated the antimicrobial activities and modes of action of penta-, hexa-, hepta-, octa-, nona-, and deca-o-galloylglucose (gallotannins) isolated from mango kernels. the mics and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) against food-borne bacteria and fungi were determined using a critical dilution assay. gram-positive bacteria were generally more susceptible to gallotannins than were gram-negative bacteria. the mics of gallotannins against bacillus subtilis, bacillus cereus, clostridium botulinum, campylobacter jejuni,  listeria monocytogenes, and staphylococcus aureus were 0.2 g liter(-1) or less; enterotoxigenic escherichia coli and salmonella enterica were inhibited by 0.5 to 1 g liter(-1), and lactic acid bacteria were resistant. the use of lipopolysaccharide mutants of s. enterica indicated that the outer membrane confers resistance toward gallotannins. supplementation of lb medium with iron eliminated the inhibitory activity of gallotannins against staphylococcus aureus, and siderophore-deficient mutants of s. enterica were less resistant toward gallotannins than was the wild-type strain. hepta-o-galloylglucose sensitized lactobacillus plantarum tmw1.460 to hop extract, indicating inactivation of hop resistance mechanisms, e.g., the multidrug resistance (mdr) transporter hora. carbohydrate metabolism of lactococcus lactis mg1363, a conditionally respiring organism, was influenced by hepta-o-galloylglucose when grown under aerobic conditions and in the presence of heme but not under anaerobic conditions, indicating that gallotannins influence the respiratory chain. in conclusion, the  inhibitory activities of gallotannins are attributable to their strong affinity for iron and likely additionally relate to the inactivation of membrane-bound proteins.

TI  == internalization of biotinylated compounds into cancer cells is promoted by a molecular trojan horse based upon core streptavidin and clostridial c2 toxin.
AB  == the c2 toxin produced by clostridium botulinum is a binary ab-type exotoxin composed of the enzyme subunit c2i and the binding/translocation moiety c2ii. after proteolytic activation, c2iia mediates the subsequent internalization of c2i into the cytosol of mammalian target cells. the n-terminal domain of c2i (c2in) is necessary for c2iia-dependent uptake, but lacks the enzyme domain that  is responsible for cytotoxicity. in the present study, we generated a delivery system building on c2in and a truncated core streptavidin (stv13) with enhanced solubility for the c2iia-dependent internalization of biotinylated cargo molecules into mammalian cells. c2in-stv13 fusion protein expressed in escherichia coli was obtained in high yields and purity. the affinity-purified protein formed tetramers and a defined higher order species in solution as shown  by gel filtration and retained its biotin-binding properties, however with an obvious reduction in affinity. uptake of c2in-stv13 into the cytosol of hela and  other cancer cell lines was observed by immunoblot analysis, which was corroborated by confocal microscopy. in addition, the fusion protein was not cytotoxic and did not inhibit cell proliferation as determined by mts assay. finally, we demonstrated the c2in-stv13/c2iia-mediated uptake of biocytin-alexa 488 as cargo into hela cells, underscoring the functionality of the generated transport system.

TI  == differential role of rho gtpases in intestinal epithelial barrier regulation in vitro.
AB  == maintenance of intestinal epithelial barrier functions is crucial to prevent systemic contamination by microbes that penetrate from the gut lumen. gtpases of  the rho-family such as rhoa, rac1, and cdc42 are known to be critically involved  in the regulation of intestinal epithelial barrier functions. however, it is still unclear whether inactivation or activation of these gtpases exerts barrier  protection or not. we tested the effects of rho gtpase activities on intestinal epithelial barrier functions by using the bacterial toxins cytotoxic necrotizing  factor 1 (cnf-1), toxin b, c3 transferase (c3 tf), and lethal toxin (lt) in an in vitro model of the intestinal epithelial barrier. incubation of cell monolayers with cnf-1 for 3 h induced exclusive activation of rhoa whereas rac1 and cdc42 activities were unchanged. as revealed by fitc-dextran flux and measurements of transepithelial electrical resistance (ter) intestinal epithelial permeability was significantly increased under these conditions. inhibition of rho kinase via  y27632 blocked barrier destabilization of cnf-1 after 3 h. in contrast, after 24  h of incubation with cnf-1 only rac1 and cdc42 but not rhoa were activated which  resulted in intestinal epithelial barrier stabilization. toxin b to inactivate rhoa, rac1, and cdc42 as well as rac1 inhibitor lt increased intestinal epithelial permeability. similar effects were observed after inhibition of rhoa/rho kinase signaling by c3 tf or y27632. taken together, these data demonstrate that both activation and inactivation of rhoa signaling increased paracellular permeability whereas activation of rac1 and cdc42 correlated with stabilized barrier functions.

TI  == detection of botulinum neurotoxin serotype b at sub mouse ld(50) levels by a sandwich immunoassay and its application to toxin detection in milk.
AB  == background: botulinum neurotoxin (bont), the causative agent of botulism, a serious neuroparylatic disease, is produced by the anaerobic bacterium clostridium botulinum and consists of a family of seven serotypes (a-h). we previously reported production of high-affinity monoclonal antibodies to bont serotype a. methods and findings: recombinant peptide fragments of the light chain, the transmembrane and receptor-binding domains of the heavy chain of botulinum neurotoxin type b (bont/b) were expressed in escherichia coli as gst-fusion proteins and purified. these proteins were used to immunize balb/cj mice for the generation of monoclonal antibodies (mabs). antibody-producing hybridomas were detected using either a direct binding elisa binding to plate-immobilized bont/b, or with a capture-capture elisa whereby the capacity of the antibody to capture bont/b from solution was tested. a total of five mabs were selected, two of which bound the toxin light chain and three bound the receptor-binding domain of bont/b heavy chain. mab mcs6-27 was identified via capture-capture elisa and was the only mab able to bind bont/b in solution under  physiological conditions. mabs f24-1, f26-16, f27-33 and f29-40 were identified via direct binding elisa, and were able to capture bont/b in solution only in the presence of 0.5-0.9 mm sodium dodecyl sulphate (sds). mab mcs6-27 and an anti-bont/b polyclonal antibody were incorporated into a sandwich elisa that did  not require sds. conclusions: we report here the generation of monoclonal antibodies to serotype b and the subsequent development of a sensitive sandwich immunoassay. this immunoassay has a detection limit of 100 fg bont/b, fifty times more sensitive than the mouse bioassay detection limit of 5 pg bont/b. additionally, this assay detected as little as 39 pg/ml of toxin in skim, 2% and  whole milk.

TI  == rapid affinity immunochromatography column-based tests for sensitive detection of clostridium botulinum neurotoxins and escherichia coli o157.
AB  == existing methods for detection of food-borne pathogens and their toxins are frequently time-consuming, require specialized equipment, and involve lengthy culture procedures and/or animal testing and are thus unsuitable for a rapid response to an emergency public health situation. a series of simple and rapid affinity immunochromatography column (aicc) assays were developed to detect clostridium botulinum neurotoxin types a, b, e, and f and escherichia coli o157 in food matrices. specifically, for milk, grape juice with peach juice, and bottled water, the detection limit for the botulinum neurotoxin type a complex was 0.5 ng. use of this method with a 10-ml sample would therefore result in a detection limit of 50 pg ml(-l). thus, this assay is approximately 2 orders of magnitude more sensitive than a comparable lateral-flow assay. for botulinum neurotoxin complex types b, e, and f, the minimum detection limit was 5 ng to 50  ng. sensitive detection of e. coli o157 was achieved, and the detection limit was 500 cells. the aicc test was also shown to be specific, rapid, and user friendly. this test takes only 15 to 30 min to complete without any specialized equipment and thus is suitable for use in the field. it has the potential to replace existing methods for presumptive detection of botulinum neurotoxin types a, b, e, and f and e. coli o157 in contaminated matrices without a requirement for preenrichment.

AB  == vacuum-packaged cooked poultry meat was treated at a range of pressures (400-600  mpa) and hold times (1, 2 and 10 min), followed by storage at 4 degrees , 8 degrees or 12 degrees c for up to 35 days. weissella viridescens was found to be  the dominant microorganism in the pressure-treated meat, constituting 100% of the microflora identified at 500 and 600 mpa. none of the pressure-treated samples had obvious signs of spoilage during the 35 day storage period, even when the weissella count was >7 log(10) cfu/g. studies on a typical w. viridescens isolate showed it to be relatively pressure-resistant in poultry meat, with <1 log reduction in numbers after a treatment of 2 min at 600 mpa. agar diffusion assays showed that the isolate also caused the inhibition of a number of gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens, including strains of clostridium botulinum, listeria monocytogenes, bacillus cereus and escherichia coli. the selection of a pressure-resistant organism, such as this weissella sp. could be advantageous in  extending the shelf-life, and also microbiological safety, of the cooked meat, as it could give protection in addition to the pressure treatment itself.

TI  == genetically engineered clostridial c2 toxin as a novel delivery system for living mammalian cells.
AB  == the c2 toxin of clostridium botulinum is a binary bacterial protein toxin, comprising the enzyme component c2i and the separate binding/translocation component c2iia. c2iia mediates the transport of c2i into the host cell cytosol.  the n-terminal domain of c2i (c2in) is enzymatically inactive but essential for c2iia-mediated internalization of c2i. here, we exploit the c2iia/c2in system to  generate a recombinant c2in-streptavidin fusion protein allowing for the delivery of biotinylated molecules into the cytosol of mammalian cells. c2in-streptavidin  overproduced in e. coli was affinity-purified and capable of binding biotinylated proteins in a concentration-dependent manner. real-time surface plasmon resonance confirmed the biotin-mediated interaction yielding a k(d)-value of approximately  0.75 mum. internalization of c2in-streptavidin into the cytosol of epithelial cells and macrophages was demonstrated by immunoblot analysis and confirmed by confocal microscopy. cell viability studies showed no cytotoxic effects of the novel transporter. furthermore, vero cells treated with biotin-fluorescein or biocytin-alexa488 as model cargo displayed a specific c2in-streptavidin/c2iia-dependent uptake, providing proof-of-principle for the functionality of this novel delivery system.

TI  == etfa catalyses the formation of dipicolinic acid in clostridium perfringens.
AB  == dipicolinic acid (dpa) is a major component of bacterial endospores, comprising 5-15% of the spore dry weight, and is important for spore stability and resistance properties. the biosynthetic precursor to dpa, dihydro-dipicolinic acid (dhdpa), is produced by dhdpa synthase within the lysine biosynthesis pathway. in bacillus subtilis, and most other bacilli and clostridia, dhdpa is oxidized to dpa by the products of the spovf operon. analysis of the genomes of the clostridia in cluster i, including the pathogens clostridium perfringens, clostridium botulinum and clostridium tetani, has shown that no spovf orthologues exist in these organisms. dpa synthase was purified from extracts of sporulating  c. perfringens cells. peptide sequencing identified an electron transfer flavoprotein, etfa, in this purified protein fraction. a c. perfringens strain with etfa inactivated is blocked in late stage sporulation and produces < or = 11% of wild-type dpa levels. c. perfringens etfa was expressed in and purified from escherichia coli, and this protein catalysed dpa formation in vitro. the sequential production of dhdpa and dpa in c. perfringens appears to be catalysed  by dhdpa synthase followed by etfa. genome sequence data and the taxonomy of spore-forming species suggest that this may be the ancestral mechanism for dpa synthesis.

AB  == botulinum neurotoxin serotype a (bont/a) is an extremely potent bacterial protein toxin. the hc fragment of bont/a (ahc) was shown to be non-toxic, antigenic, and  capable of eliciting a protective immunity in animals challenged with homologous  bont. in this study, we synthesized ahc gene by using t4 dna ligase and pcr. the  ahc was expressed at a high level in escherichia coli successfully. because of using the trx co-expression strain, the expressed ahc is in a soluble and active  form. the yield of the purified ahc was about 70mg/l, and its purity was up to 90% through one-step affinity chromatography. the ahc was positively identified by the antibodies raised against bont/a using immunological-dot-blot and western  blot assays. ahc was shown to bind with gangliosides and elicit immunity against  bont/a, indicating that the expressed and purified ahc protein retains a functionally active conformation. furthermore, the purified ahc has a strong immunogenicity and can be used as a potential subunit candidate vaccine for botulinum toxin serotype a.

TI  == expression of the clostridium botulinum a2 neurotoxin gene cluster proteins and characterization of the a2 complex.
AB  == clostridium botulinum subtype a2 possesses a botulinum neurotoxin type a (bont/a) gene cluster consisting of an orfx cluster containing open reading frames (orfs)  of unknown functions. to better understand the association between the bont/a2 complex proteins, first, the orfx cluster proteins (orfx1, orfx3, p47, and the middle part of ntnh) from c. botulinum a2 strain kyoto f and ntnh of a1 strain atcc 3502 were expressed by using either an escherichia coli or a c. botulinum expression system. polyclonal antibodies against individual orfx cluster proteins were prepared by immunizing a rabbit and mice against the expressed proteins. antibodies were then utilized as probes to determine which of the a2 orfx cluster genes were expressed in the native a2 culture. n-terminal protein sequencing was  also employed to specifically detect orfx2. results showed that all of the neurotoxin cluster proteins, except orfx1, were expressed in the a2 culture. a bont/a2 toxin complex (tc) was purified which showed that c. botulinum a2 formed  a medium-size (300-kda) tc composed of bont/a2 and ntnh without any of the other  orfx cluster proteins. ntnh subtype-specific immunoreactivity was also discovered, allowing for the differentiation of subtypes based on cluster proteins associated with bont.

TI  == cloning, high level expression and immunogenicity of 1163-1256 residues of c-terminal heavy chain of c. botulinum neurotoxin type e.
AB  == botulinum neurotoxins (bonts) inhibit neurotransmitter release from peripheral cholinergic synapses. bonts consist of a toxifying light chain and a heavy chain  (hc) linked through a disulfide bond. in the present study we explored the immunogenicity and protective capability of the most effective part corresponding to 1163-1256 residues of botulinum type e neurotoxin hc gene. dna encoding the 93 c-terminal amino acid of hc residues was synthesized with optimal codon usage for expression. these dna fragments were ligated into a plivselect vector and subcloned into expression vector pet32a. recombinant plasmids were then transformed into escherichia coli strain bl21 de3. the recombinant protein was purified by nickel affinity gel column chromatography. the hc1163-1256 was identified by antibodies raised against bont/e. hc1163-1256 was shown to bind with synaptotagmin and gangliosides, indicating that the expressed and purified hc1163-1256 protein retains a functionally active conformation. the immunization  with recombinant protein induced a protection level in mice. the immunization with 2mug of the recombinant protein induced a significant protection level in mice. in conclusion, availability of the recombinant protein provides an effective system to study the biochemical and physical interactions involved during bont binding to nerve cells and protection against its toxicity.

TI  == exploring historical canadian foodborne outbreak data sets for human illness attribution.
AB  == human illness attribution has been recently recognized as an important tool to better inform food safety decisions. analysis of outbreak data sets has been used for that purpose. this study was conducted to explore the usefulness of three comprehensive canadian foodborne outbreak data sets covering 30 years for estimating food attribution in cases of gastrointestinal illness, providing canadian food attribution estimates from a historical perspective. information concerning the microbiological etiology and food vehicles recorded for each outbreak was standardized between the data sets. the agent-food vehicle combinations were described and analyzed for changes over time by using multiple  correspondence analysis. overall, 6,908 foodborne outbreaks were available for three decades (1976 through 2005), but the agent and the food vehicle were identified in only 2,107 of these outbreaks. differences between the data sets were found in the distribution of the cause, the vehicle, and the location or size of the outbreaks. multiple correspondence analysis revealed an association between clostridium botulinum and wild meat and between c. botulinum and seafood. this analysis also highlighted changes in food attribution over time and generated the most up-to-date food attribution values for salmonellosis (29% of cases associated with produce, 15% with poultry, and 15% with meat other than poultry, pork, and beef), campylobacteriosis (56% of cases associated with poultry and 22% with dairy products other than fluid milk), and escherichia coli  infection (37% of cases associated with beef, 23% with cooked multi-ingredient dishes, and 11% with meat other than beef, poultry, and pork). because of the inherent limitations of this approach, only the main findings should be considered for policy making. the use of other human illness attribution approaches may provide further clarification.

TI  == evidence-based semiquantitative methodology for prioritization of foodborne zoonoses.
AB  == objectives: to prioritize an extended list of food- and water-borne zoonoses to allow food safety authorities to focus on the most relevant hazards in the food chain. methods: an evidence-based semiquantitative methodology was developed. scores were given by 35 scientific experts in the field of animal and public health, food, and clinical microbiology and epidemiology to 51 zoonotic agents according to five criteria related to public health (severity and occurrence in humans), animal health (severity of disease coupled with economic consequences and occurrence in animals), and food (occurrence in food). the scoring procedure  was standardized and evidence-based as experts were provided, for each zoonotic agent, a same set of up-to-date help information data related to the five criteria. independently, the relative importance of the five criteria was weighted by seven food chain risk managers. the zoonotic agents were ranked based on overall weighted scores and were grouped in four statistically different levels of importance. results: the following foodborne zoonotic pathogens were classified as "most important": salmonella spp., campylobacter spp., listeria monocytogenes, and verocytotoxigenic escherichia coli. a second group of "significant importance" included toxoplasma gondii, the agent of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, clostridium botulinum, staphylococcus aureus, cryptosporidium parvum, mycobacterium bovis, echinococcus granulosus, streptococcus spp., echinococcus multilocularis, yersinia enterocolitica, mycobacterium avium, fasciola hepatica, giardia intestinalis, and rotavirus. conclusions: this methodology allowed to rank 51 zoonotic agents with objectivity and taking account of a combined input from risk assessors and risk managers. applications: these results support food safety policy makers to establish the multiannual monitoring program of foodborne zoonoses. they also enable to identify knowledge gaps on specific zoonotic agents and to formulate key research questions. principally, this method of prioritization is of general interest as it can be applied for any other ranking exercise and in any country.

TI  == foodborne and indicator bacteria in farmed molluscan shellfish before and after depuration.
AB  == galicia's coast (northwestern spain) is a major producer of bivalve molluscs. over an 18-month period, the presence of salmonella, aeromonas, plesiomonas shigelloides, vibrio parahaemolyticus, and clostridium botulinum was determined by pcr methods in mussels (22 batches) and infaunal bivalves (31 batches of clams and cockles) before and after depuration. all batches were harvested from galician class b harvesting areas where bivalve molluscs must not exceed 4,600 escherichia coli per 100 g of flesh and liquor in 90% of the samples. virulence-associated genes of salmonella (inva), aeromonas (aera, hlya, alt, ast, and laf), p. shigelloides (huga), v. parahaemolyticus (tdh and trh), and c. botulinum (bont) were not detected. the pr72h chromosomal dna fragment, which is  conservative in v. parahaemolyticus strains, was detected in five (4.7%) samples. a number of 192 suspect isolates did not fit the description of clinical aeromonas phenospecies, pathogenic vibrio spp., or p. shigelloides. the effectiveness of commercial depuration in reducing bacterial indicators was also  examined. e. coli was reduced to < or = 230/100 g of flesh and liquor in 90.9% of mussel lots but in only 70.9% of infaunal bivalve lots. for total coliform elimination, mussels were also more effective. total counts significantly (p < 0.005) correlated with numbers of pseudomonas, aeromonas, and vibrio. our data indicate that salmonella and pathogenic bacteria indigenous to estuarine environments do not appear to be significant hazards in galician molluscan shellfish. a reason for concern, however, is that clearance of e. coli to acceptable levels was not always achieved especially in infaunal bivalves.

TI  == surveillance for foodborne disease outbreaks - united states, 2006.
AB  == foodborne illnesses are a major health burden in the united states. most of these illnesses are preventable, and analysis of outbreaks helps identify control measures. although most cases are sporadic, investigation of the portion that occur as part of recognized outbreaks can provide insights into the pathogens, food vehicles, and food-handling practices associated with foodborne infections.  cdc collects data on foodborne disease outbreaks (fbdos) from all states and territories through the foodborne disease outbreak surveillance system (fbdss). this report summarizes epidemiologic data on fbdos reported during 2006 (the most recent year for which data have been analyzed). a total of 1,270 fbdos were reported, resulting in 27,634 cases and 11 deaths. among the 624 fbdos with a confirmed etiology, norovirus was the most common cause, accounting for 54% of outbreaks and 11,879 cases, followed by salmonella (18% of outbreaks and 3,252 cases). among the 11 reported deaths, 10 were attributed to bacterial etiologies  (six escherichia coli o157:h7, two listeria monocytogenes, one salmonella serotype enteritidis, and one clostridium botulinum), and one was attributed to a chemical (mushroom toxin). among outbreaks caused by a single food vehicle, the most common food commodities to which outbreak-related cases were attributed were poultry (21%), leafy vegetables (17%), and fruits/nuts (16%). public health professionals can use this information to 1) target control strategies for specific pathogens in particular foods along the farm-to-table continuum and 2) support good food-handling practices among restaurant workers and the public.

AB  == clostridium botulinum produces botulinum neurotoxin (bont) as a large toxin complex associated with nontoxic-nonhemagglutinin (ntnha) and/or hemagglutinin components. in the present study, high-level expression of full-length (1197 amino acids) rntnha from c. botulinum serotype d strain 4947 (d-4947) was achieved in an escherichia coli system. spontaneous nicking of the rntnha at a specific site was observed during long-term incubation in the presence of protease inhibitors; this was also observed in natural ntnha. the rntnha assembled with isolated d-4947 bont with molar ratio 1:1 to form a toxin complex. the reconstituted toxin complex exhibited dramatic resistance to proteolysis by pepsin or trypsin at high concentrations, despite the fact that the isolated bont and rntnha proteins were both easily degraded. we provide definitive evidence that ntnha plays a crucial role in protecting bont, which is an oral toxin, from  digestion by proteases common in the stomach and intestine.

TI  == production of serotype c specific and serotype c/d generic monoclonal antibodies  using recombinant h(c) and h(n) fragments from clostridium botulinum neurotoxin types c(1) and d.
AB  == sequence variability of clostridium botulinum serotypes c and d is particularly complex. some serotype c and d strains have unique gene structures that encode mosaic isoforms of botulinum neurotoxin (bont) containing components of both bont type c(1) (bont/c(1)) and bont type d (bont/d). such sequence variability and the potential for cross neutralisation must be taken into consideration when developing serotype c and d detection and identification assays. three fusion proteins containing either a fragment from the carboxyl-terminal domain of the heavy chain (h(c)) of bont/c(1) (strain 573), a fragment from the h(c) of bont/d  (strain bvd/-3) or a fragment from the amino-terminal domain of the heavy chain (h(n)) of bont/c(1) (strain 573) were expressed in escherichia coli, and administered as immunogens to mice. monoclonal antibodies (mabs) against the recombinant bont fragments were prepared by three fusions. mabs recognising native bont/c(1) and bont/d were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). nine monoclonal antibodies (mabs) were produced, six of which recognised a bont fragment that is highly conserved across all serotype c and d producing strains. we conclude that these mabs and this approach to mab production may facilitate the development of immunological diagnostic techniques that are not constrained by the existence of mosaic isoforms for the detection and identification of serotypes c and d.

TI  == extracting survival parameters from isothermal, isobaric, and "iso-concentration" inactivation experiments by the "3 end points method".
AB  == theoretically, if an organism's resistance can be characterized by 3 survival parameters, they can be found by solving 3 simultaneous equations that relate the final survival ratio to the lethal agent's intensity. (for 2 resistance parameters, 2 equations will suffice.) in practice, the inevitable experimental scatter would distort the results of such a calculation or render the method unworkable. averaging the results obtained with more than 3 final survival ratio  triplet combinations, determined in four or more treatments, can remove this impediment. this can be confirmed by the ability of a kinetic inactivation model  derived from the averaged parameters to predict survival patterns under conditions not employed in their determination, as demonstrated with published isothermal survival data of clostridium botulinum spores, isobaric data of escherichia coli under hpp, and pseudomonas exposed to hydrogen peroxide. both the method and the underlying assumption that the inactivation followed a weibull-log logistic (well) kinetics were confirmed in this way, indicating that  when an appropriate survival model is available, it is possible to predict the entire inactivation curves from several experimental final survival ratios alone. where applicable, the method could simplify the experimental procedure and lower  the cost of microbial resistance determinations. in principle, the methodology can be extended to deteriorative chemical reactions if they too can be characterized by 2 or 3 kinetic parameters.

TI  == rhoa gtpase and f-actin dynamically regulate the permeability of cx43-made channels in rat cardiac myocytes.
AB  == gap junctions are clusters of transmembrane channels allowing a passive diffusion of ions and small molecules between adjacent cells. connexin43, the main channel-forming protein expressed in ventricular myocytes, can associate with zonula occludens-1, a scaffolding protein linked to the actin cytoskeleton and to signal transduction molecules. the possible influence of rho gtpases, major regulators of cellular junctions and of the actin cytoskeleton, in the modulation of gap junctional intercellular communication (gjic) was examined. the activation of rhoa by cytoxic necrotizing factor 1 markedly enhanced gjic, whereas its specific inhibition by the clostridium botulinum c3 exoenzyme significantly reduced it. rhoa activity affects gjic without major cellular redistribution of junctional plaques or changes in the cx43 phosphorylation pattern. as these gtpases frequently act via the cortical cytoskeleton, the importance of f-actin in the modulation of gjic was investigated by means of agents interfering with actin polymerization. cytoskeleton stabilization by phalloidin slowed down the kinetics of channel rundown in the absence of atp, whereas its disruption by cytochalasin d rapidly and markedly reduced gjic despite atp presence. cytoskeleton stabilization by phalloidin markedly reduced the consequences of rhoa activation or inactivation. this mechanism appears to be the first described capable to both up- or down-regulate gjic through rhoa activation or, conversely, inhibition. the inhibition of rho downstream kinase effectors had no effect on gjic. the present results provide further insight into the gating and regulation  of junctional channels and identify a new downstream target for the small g-protein rhoa.

AB  == recombinant whole heavy chains (h, 100 kda) and their n-terminal (hn, 50 kda) and c-terminal (hc, 50 kda) half fragments of clostridium botulinum type c and d neurotoxins were expressed as glutathione s-transferase (gst) fusion proteins in  escherichia coli. gst eliminated-preparations of h (10 microg), hn (5 microg), hc (5 microg), or a mixture of hn (5 microg) and hc (5 microg) of types c and d were mixed with an equal volume of adjuvant, and then were twice injected into mice subcutaneously. after immunization, the mice were challenged with up to 10(6) the minimum lethal doses (mld)/0.5 ml of c or d toxin, the type of which was same as  that of the immunogens. all of the mice immunized with antigens except for hn survived against 10(5) to 10(6) mld/0.5 ml of the toxins, but the mice immunized  with hn were killed by 100 mld/0.5 ml. the mice immunized with a mixture of c-hc  and d-hc, each 5 microg, also showed a high level of resistance against both c and d toxins. antibody levels immunized with gst fused-or gst eliminatedpreparation were quite similar. these results indicate that recombinant gst-fused hc can be used as a safe and effective vaccine for type c and d botulism in animals. it also became clear that one time inoculation with a large  amount of c-hc or d-hc, 100 microg, is useful for vaccine trials in mice.

TI  == cloning, expression, purification, and characterization of biologically active recombinant hemagglutinin-33, type a botulinum neurotoxin associated protein.
AB  == botulinum neurotoxin type a, the most toxic substance known to mankind, is produced by clostridiurn botulinum type a as a complex with a group of neurotoxin-associated proteins (naps) through polycistronic expression of a clustered group of genes. hemagglutinin-33 (hn-33) is a 33 kda subcomponent of naps, which is resistant to protease digestion, a feature likely to be involved in the protection of the botulinum neurotoxin from proteolysis. in order to fully understand the function of hn-33, large amounts of hn-33 will be needed without dealing with biosafety risks to grow large cultures of c. botulinum. there are difficulties to clone the genes with the high a + t contents produced by c. botulinum. we report here for the first time using the gateway technology to clone functional hn-33 that has been expressed in e. coli. the yield of the recombinant hn-33 was about 12 mg per liter of e. coli culture. the recombinant hn-33 folds well in aqueous solution as shown with circular dichroism spectra, resists temperature-denaturation, is totally resistant to trypsin proteolysis despite the presence of cleavage sites on the molecular surface, and maintains its biological activities comparable to the native hn-33 hemagglutination.

TI  == unique substrate recognition by botulinum neurotoxins serotypes a and e.
AB  == botulinum neurotoxins (bonts) are zinc proteases that cleave snare proteins to elicit flaccid paralysis by inhibiting the fusion of neurotransmitter-carrying vesicles to the plasma membrane of peripheral neurons. there are seven serotypes  of bont, termed a-g. bont serotype a and serotype e cleave snap25 at residues 197-198 and 180-181, respectively. unlike other zinc proteases, the bonts recognize extended regions of snap25 for cleavage. the basis for this extended substrate recognition and specificity is unclear. saturation mutagenesis and deletion mapping identified residues 156-202 of snap25 as the optimal cleavage domain for bont/a, whereas the optimal cleavage domain for bont/e was shorter, comprising residues 167-186 of snap25. two sub-sites were resolved within each optimal cleavage domain, which included a recognition or active site (as) domain  that contained the site of cleavage and a binding (b) domain, which contributed to substrate affinity. within the as domains, the p1', p3, and p5 sites of snap25 contributed to scissile bond cleavage by lc/a, whereas the p1' and p2 sites of snap25 contributed to scissile bond cleavage by lc/e. these studies provide insight into the development of strategies for small molecule inhibitors of the bonts.

AB  == a clostridium sp. isolated from intestine of decaying fish exhibited 99% sequence identity with c. tetani at 16s rrna level. it produced a neurotoxin that was neutralized by botulinum antitoxin (a+b+e) as well as tetanus antitoxin. the gene fragments for light chain, c-terminal and n-terminal regions of the heavy chain of the toxin were amplified using three reported primer sets for tetanus neurotoxin (tent). the neurotoxin gene fragments were cloned in escherichia coli  and sequenced. the sequences obtained exhibited approximately 98, 99 and 98% sequence identity with reported gene sequences of tent/lc, tent/hc and tent/hn, respectively. the phylogenetic interrelationship between the neurotoxin gene of clostridium sp. with previously reported gene sequences of clostridium botulinum  a to g and c. tetani was examined by analysis of differences in the nucleotide sequences. six amino acids were substituted at four different positions in the light chain of neurotoxin from the isolate when compared with the reported closest sequence of tent. of these, four were located in the beta15 motif at a solvent inaccessible, buried region of the protein molecule. one of these substitutions were on the solvent accessible surface residue of alpha1 motif, previously shown to have strong sequence conservation. a substitution of two amino acids observed in n-terminal region of heavy chain were buried residues, located in the beta21 and beta37 motifs showing variability in other related sequences. the c-terminal region responsible for binding to receptor was conserved, showing no changes in the amino acid sequence.

TI  == fluorescent assay of cell-permeable c3 transferase activity.
AB  == c3 transferase has been extensively used in the investigation of rho signaling. it acts as a rho antagonist by covalently attaching an adp-ribose group to rhoa,  b, and c proteins. cell-permeable c3 fusion proteins have been developed so that  lower doses of c3 can be used. we describe a simple and fast fluorescence-based assay to evaluate the enzymatic activity of cell-permeable c3 proteins purified from escherichia coli. the assay measures glycohydrolase (gh) activity of c3 that cleaves nad+ into adp-ribose and nicotinamide. results from the gh activity correlate with other tests carried out in tissue culture cells such as neurite outgrowth or adp ribosylation of rhoa. this method provides reliable measurements of the activity of permeable c3 proteins or other c3-related proteins.

TI  == exchange of glutamine-217 to glutamate of clostridium limosum exoenzyme c3 turns  the asparagine-specific adp-ribosyltransferase into an arginine-modifying enzyme.
AB  == c3-like adp-ribosyltransferaseses are produced by clostridium species, bacillus cereus, and various staphylococcus aureus strains. the exoenzymes modify the low-molecular-mass gtpases rhoa, b, and c. in structural studies of c3-like exoenzymes, an artt-motif (adp-ribosylating turn-turn motif) was identified that  appears to be involved in substrate specificity and recognition (han, s., arvai,  a. s., clancy, s. b., tainer, j. a. (2001) j. mol. biol. 305, 95-107). exchange of gln217, which is a key residue of the artt-motif, to glu in c3 from clostridium limosum results in inhibition of adp-ribosyltransferase activity toward rhoa. the mutant protein is still capable of nad-binding and possesses nad+ glycohydrolase activity. whereas recombinant wild-type c3 modifies rho proteins specifically at an asparagine residue (asn41), gln217glu-c3 is capable of adp-ribosylation of poly-arginine but not poly-asparagine. soybean trypsin inhibitor, a model substrate for many arginine-specific adp-ribosyltransferases,  is modified by the gln217glu-c3 transferase. also in c3 adp-ribosyltransferases from clostridium botulinum and b. cereus, the exchange of the equivalent gln residue to glu blocked asparagine modification of rhoa but elicited arginine-specific adp-ribosylation. moreover, the gln217glu-c3lim transferase was able to adp-ribosylate recombinant wild-type c3lim at arg86, resulting in decrease in adp-ribosyltransferase activity of the wild-type enzyme. the data indicate that the exchange of one amino acid residue in the artt-motif turns the  asparagine-modifying adp-ribosyltransferases of the c3 family into arginine-adp-ribosylating transferases.

AB  == clostridium botulinum neurotoxins (bonts) are the most toxic proteins for humans. the current clostridial-derived vaccines against bont intoxication have limitations including production and accessibility. conditions were established to express the soluble receptor binding domain (heavy-chain receptor [hcr]) of bont serotypes a and e in escherichia coli. sera isolated from mice and rabbits immunized with recombinant hcr/a1 (rhcr/a1) from the classical type a-hall strain (atcc 3502) (bont/a1) and rhcr/e from bont serotype e beluga (bont/e(b)) neutralized the homologous serotype of bont but displayed differences in cross-recognition and cross-protection. enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and western blotting showed that alpha-rhcr/a1 recognized epitopes within the c terminus of the hcr/a and hcr/e, while alpha-rhcr/e recognized epitopes within the n terminus or interface between the n and c termini of the hcr proteins. alpha-rhcr/e(b) sera possessed detectable neutralizing capacity for bont/a1, while alpha-rhcr/a1 did not neutralize bont/e. rhcr/a was an effective immunogen  against bont/a1 and the kyoto f infant strain (bont/a2), but not bont serotype e  alaska (bont/e(a)), while rhcr/e(b) neutralized bont/e(a), and under hyperimmunization conditions protected against bont/a1 and bont/a2. the protection elicited by rhcr/a1 to bont/a1 and bont/a2 and by rhcr/e(b) to bont/e(a) indicate that immunization with receptor binding domains elicit protection within sub-serotypes of bont. the protection elicited by hyperimmunization with rhcr/e against bont/a suggests the presence of common neutralizing epitopes between the serotypes e and a. these results show that a receptor binding domain subunit vaccine protects against serotype variants of bonts.

TI  == efficient production of clostridium botulinum exotoxin c3 in bacteria: a screening method to optimize production yields.
AB  == clostridium botulinum exoenzyme c3 is responsible for the inactivation of members of the rho gtpase family that are implicated in actin-cytoskeleton reorganization. this property has been extensively used in the field to investigate the functionality of the rho gtpases. however, systematic analysis of rho gtpase functions requires large amounts of such inhibitors and consequently an optimization of the production yield of these proteins. bacterial production of soluble proteins often requires a refolding step that noticeably affects the production yields and necessitates additional experiments to verify functional activity. this is particularly true for tat-c3, the production yields of which are generally low. in this report, we describe a rapid and efficient method for the production of soluble c3 exoenzyme developed by screening a collection of bacterial strains. the recombinant c3 protein was fused to the tat protein-transduction domain from hiv, to allow protein delivery into cells, and to a hexahistidine tag, that permitted purification by nickel affinity chromatography. we have demonstrated the production of large amounts of soluble and functional protein using the bacterial strain ad494 (de3)plyss. this rapid and efficient method for the production of soluble c3 exoenzyme could also be useful for the production of other proteins with solubility problems.

TI  == cnf and dnt.
AB  == the actin cytoskeleton of mammalian cells is involved in many processes that affect the growth and colonization of bacteria, such as migration of immune cells, phagocytosis by macrophages, secretion of cytokines, maintenance of epithelial barrier functions and others. with respect to these functions, it is not surprising that many bacterial protein toxins, which are important virulence  factors and causative agents of human and/or animal diseases, target the actin cytoskeleton of the host. some toxins target actin directly, such as the c2 toxin produced by clostridium botulinum. moreover, bacterial toxins target the cytoskeleton indirectly by modifying actin regulators such as the low-molecular-mass guanosine triphosphate (gtp)-binding proteins of the rho family. remarkably, toxins affect these gtpases in a bidirectional manner. some toxins inhibit and some activate the gtpases. here we review the rho-activating toxins cnf1 and cnf2 (cytotoxic necrotizing factors) from escherichia coli, the yersinia cnf(y) and the dermonecrotic toxin (dnt) from bordetella species. we describe and compare their uptake into mammalian cells, mode of action, structure-function relationship, substrate specificity and role in diseases.

TI  == phages and the evolution of bacterial pathogens: from genomic rearrangements to lysogenic conversion.
AB  == comparative genomics demonstrated that the chromosomes from bacteria and their viruses (bacteriophages) are coevolving. this process is most evident for bacterial pathogens where the majority contain prophages or phage remnants integrated into the bacterial dna. many prophages from bacterial pathogens encode virulence factors. two situations can be distinguished: vibrio cholerae, shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli, corynebacterium diphtheriae, and clostridium botulinum depend on a specific prophage-encoded toxin for causing a specific disease, whereas staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium harbor a multitude of prophages and each phage-encoded virulence or fitness factor makes an incremental contribution to the fitness of the lysogen. these prophages behave like "swarms" of related prophages. prophage diversification seems to be fueled by the frequent transfer of phage material by recombination with superinfecting phages, resident prophages, or occasional acquisition of other mobile dna elements or bacterial chromosomal genes. prophages also contribute to the diversification of the bacterial genome architecture. in many cases, they actually represent a large fraction of the strain-specific dna sequences. in addition, they can serve as anchoring points for genome inversions. the current review presents the available genomics and biological data on prophages from bacterial pathogens in an evolutionary framework.

TI  == the c-terminus of botulinum neurotoxin type a light chain contributes to solubility, catalysis, and stability.
AB  == botulinum neurotoxin type a (bont/a) is the etiological agent responsible for botulism, a disease characterized by peripheral neuromuscular blockade. bont/a is produced by clostridium botulinum as a single chain protein that is activated by  proteolytic cleavage to form a 50 kda light chain (lc, 448 amino acids) and a disulfide bond-linked 100 kda heavy chain (hc, 847 amino acids). whilst hc comprises the receptor binding and translocation domains, lc is a zn2+-endopeptidase that cleaves at a single glutaminyl-arginine bond corresponding to residues 197 and 198 at the c-terminus of snap25. cleavage of snap25 uncouples the neural exocytosis docking/fusion machinery. lc/a (lc 1-448)  and several c-terminal deletion proteins of lc/a were engineered and expressed as his-tagged fusion proteins in escherichia coli. lc 1-448 was purified, but precipitated upon storage. approximately 40% of lc 1-448 was a covalent dimer due to the formation of inter-chain disulfide bond formation at cys430. conversion of cys430 to ser abolished dimer formation of lc 1-448, but did not improve solubility. three c-terminal deletion peptides were engineered; lc 1-425 and lc 1-418 were expressed and could be purified as soluble and stable proteins, whilst lc 1-398 was soluble, but not stable to storage. kinetic studies showed that lc 1-448 and lc 1-425 efficiently cleaved gst-snap25 and the fluorescent substrate snaptide, while lc 1-418 catalyzed the cleavage of both the snap25 and the fluorescent substrate snaptide with a similar km, but at a 10-fold slower kcat. thus, regions within the c-terminus of lc/a contribute to solubility, stability,  and catalysis.

(his(6))-bont/b hc tbd was highly expressed in escherichia coli bl21-codonplus (de3)-ril and isolated from the e. coli inclusion bodies. after solubilizing the purified inclusion bodies with 6m guanidine-hcl in the presence of 10mm beta-mercaptoethanol, the protein was purified and refolded in a single step on ni(2+) affinity column by removing  beta-mercaptoethanol first, followed by the removal of urea. the purified protein was determined to be 98% pure as assessed by sds-polyacrylamide gel. (his(6))-bont/b hc tbd retained binding to synaptotagmin ii, the receptor of bont/b, which was confirmed by immunological dot blot assay, also to ganglioside, which was investigated using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

TI  == bactericidal effects of konjac fluid on several food-poisoning bacteria.
AB  == in this study, the bactericidal effects of japanese alkaline foods on food-poisoning bacteria were evaluated. konjac is an alkaline food soaked in calcinated calcium (the ph of konjac fluid ranges from 11.42 to 12.53). konjac fluids completely inactivated escherichia coli, enterohemorrhagic e. coli o157:h7 and e. coil o26:h9, salmonella enteritidis, vibrio parahemolyticus. and staphylococcus aureus. the initial level of 6 log cfu/ml dramatically decreased after incubation with konjac fluid, and no viable gram-negative bacterium cells could be detected within 1 to 2 days and no viable s. aureus cells could be detected within 3 to 5 days. on the other hand, treatment with konjac fluid was also effective in reducing levels of spore-forming bacteria (bacillus subtilis, bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens, and clostridium botulinum type e and type a). at least a 4-log reduction of spore-forming bacteria was obtained in konjac fluid within 7 to 14 days. vegetative cells were more susceptible to konjac fluid than spores were. when the initial cell count was 6 log cfu/ml, a few surviving spores remained for 60 to 90 days, but no spores could be detected  after 120 days. when the initial count of spore-forming bacteria was 3 to 4 log cfu/ml, the cells considered vegetative were completely inactivated within i to 3 days. repeated treatment with konjac fluid caused complete inactivation of spores in less than 1 to 3 days. our studies indicate that konjac fluid, which has a long history of use in food, will control food-poisoning bacterial contamination  during the production or preservation of konjac and other foods and has a preventive effect on bacteria that can cause severe disease at uniquely low levels.

TI  == mechanism of c2-toxin inhibition by fluphenazine and related compounds: investigation of their binding kinetics to the c2ii-channel using the current noise analysis.
AB  == the binding component c2ii of the binary actin adp-ribosylating c2-toxin from clostridium botulinum is essential for intoxication of target cells. activation by a protease leads to channel formation and this is presumably required for the  transport of the toxic c2i component into cells. the c2ii-channel is cation selective and contains a binding site for fluphenazine and structurally related compounds. ion transport through c2ii and in vivo intoxication is blocked when the sites are occupied by the ligands. c2ii was reconstituted into artificial lipid bilayer membranes and formed ion permeable channels. the binding constant of chloroquine, primaquine, quinacrine, chloropromazine and fluphenazine to the c2ii-channel was determined using titration experiments, which resulted in its block. the ligand-induced current noise of the c2ii-channels was investigated using fast fourier transformation. the noise of the open channels had a rather small spectral density, which was a function of the inverse frequency up to about 100 hz. upon addition of ligands to the aqueous phase the current through c2ii decreased in a dose-dependent manner. simultaneously, the spectral density of the current noise increased drastically and its frequency dependence was of lorentzian type, which was caused by the on and off-reactions of the ligand-mediated channel block. the ligand-induced current noise of c2ii was used  for the evaluation of the binding kinetics for different ligands to the channel.  the on-rate constant of ligand binding was between 10(7) and 10(9) m(-1) s(-1) and was dependent on the ionic strength of the aqueous phase. the off-rate varied between about 10 s(-1) and 3900 s(-1) and depended on the structure of the ligand. the role of structural requirements for the effective block of c2ii by the different ligands is discussed.

TI  == enteric illness in ontario, canada, from 1997 to 2001.
AB  == enteric illness is a common problem worldwide. in ontario (population of 11.4 million, 2001 census of canada), laboratory-confirmed cases of "reportable" enteric diseases are reported to local health units. public health staff members  investigate these illnesses and subsequently report details to the ministry of health and long-term care through an electronic reporting system. from 1997 to 2001, 44,451 sporadic cases of illness attributable to eight enteric pathogens (campylobacter, salmonella, verotoxin-producing escherichia coli, yersinia, shigella, hepatitis a, listeria, and clostridium botulinum) were reported. this number was less than the 56,690 cases reported from 1992 to 1996. campylobacter accounted for the highest annual average incidence rate at 42.3 cases per 100,000 persons, with salmonella following at 22.6, verotoxin-producing e. coli at 3.7, yersinia at 3.0, shigella at 2.7, hepatitis a at 2.3, and listeria at 0.3. the 4  months from june to september accounted for almost half (46.5%) of all cases. for 74.0% of the outbreaks associated with these eight enteric pathogens, foodborne contamination was identified as the mode of transmission. poultry and other meat  items accounted for 68.4% of the food items when food was identified as the vehicle. admittedly, the "foods" and "modes of transmission" identified may have  been subject to investigator bias based on previous knowledge. the most common risk setting, which was reported in approximately half of the cases, was private  homes; travel-associated illness and restaurants were the second and third most frequently reported risk settings at 24.6 and 14.1%, respectively. findings from  this study suggest that public health efforts should be directed toward safe food handling in the home during the summer months.

AB  == we report novel findings of significant amounts of 60- and 10-kda proteins on sds-page in a culture supernatant of the clostridium botulinum type d strain 4947 (d-4947). the n-terminal amino acid sequences of the purified proteins were closely related to those of other bacterial groel and groes proteins, and both positively cross-reacted with escherichia coli groel and groes antibodies. native groel homologue as an oligomeric complex is a weak atpase whose activity is inhibited by the presence of groes homologue. the 2634-bp groesl operon of d-4947 was isolated by pcr and sequenced. the sequence included two complete open reading frames (282 and 1629 bp), which were homologous to the groes and groel gene family of bacterial proteins. southern and northern blot analyses indicate that the groesl operon is encoded on the genomic dna of d-4947 as a single copy,  and not on that of its specific toxin-converting phage.

TI  == channel formation by the binding component of clostridium botulinum c2 toxin: glutamate 307 of c2ii affects channel properties in vitro and ph-dependent c2i translocation in vivo.
AB  == the binding component (c2ii) of the binary clostridium botulinum c2 toxin mediates transport of the actin adp-ribosylating enzyme component (c2i) into the  cytosol of target cells. c2ii (80 kda) is activated by trypsin cleavage, and proteolytically activated c2ii (60 kda) oligomerizes to heptamers in solution. activated c2ii forms channels in lipid bilayer membranes which are highly cation  selective and voltage-gated. a role for this channel in c2i translocation across  the cell membrane into the cytosol is discussed. amino acid residues 303-331 of c2ii contain a conserved pattern of alternating hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues, which likely facilitates membrane insertion and channel formation by creating two antiparallel beta-strands. some of the residues are in strategic positions within the putative c2ii channel, in particular, glutamate 307 (e307) localized in its center and glycine 316 (g316) localized on the trans side of the membrane. here, single-lysine substitutions of these amino acids and the double mutant e307k/g316k of c2ii were analyzed in vivo and in artificial lipid bilayer  experiments. the ph dependence of c2i transport across cellular membranes was altered, and a ph of <or=5.2 was needed for c2i translocation into target cells;  otherwise, no change in c2ii-promoted entry of c2i into vero cells was observed.  the channel properties of c2ii were substantially changed by the mutations, as evidenced by reduced cation selectivity. interestingly, the voltage dependence of wild-type c2ii was completely lost for the e307k mutant, which means that e307 is responsible for voltage gating. chloroquine blocked the e307k mutant channel and  intoxication of vero cells by mutant c2ii and c2i, indicating that chloroquine binding does not involve e307. overall, the voltage gating and cation selectivity of the c2ii channel do not play an important role in translocation of c2i into the cytosol.

TI  == purification and characterization of brochocin a and brochocin b(10-43), a functional fragment generated by heterologous expression in carnobacterium piscicola.
AB  == brochothrix campestris atcc 43754 produces a heat-stable, two-component, nonlantibiotic, class iib bacteriocin, brochocin c (brcc), that is active against a broad range of gram-positive bacteria, including spores of clostridium botulinum. an improved purification method was developed for brcc, in which n-butanol and chloroform extraction are used. mass spectral characterization of the two components, brochocin a (brca) and brochocin b (brcb), showed that both components are excreted into the medium by b. campestris as mature peptides consisting of 59 and 43 amino acids, respectively. separate expression clones of  brca and brcb were constructed previously in carnobacterium piscicola lv17c, but  the products were not chemically characterized. purification by the new protocol  showed that brca is expressed as the mature 59-amino-acid peptide but that brcb is produced by c. piscicola as a fragment, brcb(10-43), which is cleaved at an internal gly-gly site. this fragment is not antimicrobial by itself, but in combination with brca it displays the full activity of the brcc complex. circular dichroism measurements revealed a high beta-sheet content in the secondary structure of both brca and brcb(10-43), as well as in a 1:1 brca-brcb(10-43) mixture. separate expression clones of brca and brcb were also constructed in escherichia coli, but these clones only produced multiple fragments of the desired peptides with little or no activity.

TI  == sequence of the gene for clostridium botulinum type b neurotoxin associated with  infant botulism, expression of the c-terminal half of heavy chain and its binding activity.
AB  == previously, we demonstrated that the neurotoxin of strain 111 (111/nt) associated with type b infant botulism showed antigenic and biological properties different  from that (okra/nt) produced by a foodborne botulism-related strain, okra. in this study, the neurotoxin genes of 111/nt and okra/nt were amplified and the sequences determined. the nucleotide sequences of the genes for both neurotoxins  possessed an open reading frame of 3873 bp that encoded 1291 amino acids. the identities of nucleotide sequences and amino acid sequences were 97.6% and 95.7%, respectively. the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions was 0.47. the amino acid substitutions between 111/nt and okra/nt occurred mainly in the domain of the c-terminal half of heavy chain (h(c)) responsible for binding to its receptor complex of protein and ganglioside. to characterize the binding capability of the h(c), recombinant genes for the h(c) and two hybrid h(c) in which one half of okra/nt was replaced by the homologous half of 111/nt were constructed and expressed in escherichia coli. the binding activity of the recombinant h(c) of 111/nt to the protein receptor synaptotagmin ii, in the presence of ganglioside gt1b, was 4.2-fold less than okra/nt, consistent with the corresponding two nts. the use of hybrid h(c) revealed that mutation of 23 residues in carboxy terminal half of h(c) (1029-1291) of okra/nt could be attributed to the lower binding activity of 111/nt and thus the differences in binding affinity between the two bont/b.

TI  == mucosal immunisation with clostridium botulinum type c 16 s toxoid and its non-toxic component.
AB  == clostridium botulinum types c and d produce a 16 s (500 kda) toxin that is formed by conjugation of neurotoxin with a non-toxic component (nontox). the amino acid  sequences of type c and d nontox components are almost identical. in a previous report it was proposed that nontox is necessary for the effective absorption of the toxin from the small intestine. this suggested the hypothesis that mucosal immunity against nontox in the small intestine might prevent the absorption of both c- and d-16 s toxins. the nontox was purified from a mutant strain, (c)-n71, that does not produce neurotoxin. this nontox or detoxified c-16 s toxin were mixed with adjuvant (a mutant form of heat-labile toxin of escherichia coli), and inoculated into mice via the nasal or oral route, or both. the mice inoculated nasally four times with nontox or toxoid produced high levels of antibodies (including iga) against the immunogens, both in intestinal fluids and sera. when  these nontox-immunised mice were challenged orally with 2 and 20 oral minimum lethal doses (mld) of c- or d-16 s toxins, the same results were obtained with both c and d; the mice survived after challenge with 2 mld of either c or d but were killed by 20 mld of either toxin although the time to death was significantly longer than in the control non-immunised mice. these results indicate that the local anti-nontox antibodies reduce absorption of both c- and d-16 s toxins from the small intestine. the c-16 s toxoid-immunised mice showed similar behaviour with type d toxin challenge, probably due to the same mechanism, but were protected against 20 mld of c-16 s toxin.

TI  == clostridium perfringens iota toxin. mapping of the ia domain involved in docking  with ib and cellular internalization.
AB  == clostridium perfringens iota toxin consists of two unlinked proteins. the binding component (ib) is required to internalize into cells an enzymatic component (ia)  that adp-ribosylates g-actin. to characterize the ia domain that interacts with ib, fusion proteins were constructed between the c. botulinum c3 enzyme, which adp-ribosylates rho, and various truncated versions of ia. these chimeric molecules retained the wild type adp-ribosyltransferase activity specific for rho and were recognized by antibodies against c3 enzyme and ia. internalization of each chimera into vero cells was assessed by measuring the disorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and intracellular adp-ribosylation of rho. fusion proteins containing c3 linked to the c terminus of ia were transported most efficiently into cells like wild type ia in an ib-dependent manner that was blocked by bafilomycin a1. the minimal ia fragment that promoted translocation of ia-c3 chimeras into cells consisted of 128 central residues (129-257). these findings revealed that iota toxin is a suitable system for mediating the entry of heterologous proteins such as c3 into cells.

TI  == leukotriene d(4) induces stress-fibre formation in intestinal epithelial cells via activation of rhoa and pkcdelta.
AB  == the intestinal epithelial barrier, which is regulated by the actin cytoskeleton,  exhibits permeability changes during inflammation. here we show that activation of the cyslt(1) receptor by the inflammatory mediator leukotriene d(4) (ltd(4)) causes a rapid increase in stress-fibre formation in intestinal epithelial cells. this effect was mimicked by cytotoxic necrotising factor-1 (cnf-1)-induced activation of rhoa, overexpression of constitutively active rhoa (l63-rhoa) and phorbol-ester-induced activation of protein kinase c (pkc). in accordance, inhibition of rhoa, by c3 exoenzyme or by dominant-negative rhoa (n19-rhoa), as well as gf109203x-induced inhibition of pkc, suppressed the ltd(4)-induced stress-fibre formation. introduction of the dominant-negative regulatory domain of pkcdelta, but not the corresponding structures from pkcalpha, betaii or epsilon, blocked the ltd(4)-induced stress-fibre formation. evaluating the relationship between pkcdelta and rhoa in ltd(4)-induced stress-fibre formation,  we found that c3 exoenzyme inhibited the rapid ltd(4)-elicited translocation of pkcdelta to the plasma membrane. furthermore, cnf-1-induced stress-fibre formation was blocked by gf109203x and by overexpression of the regulatory domain of pkc-delta, whereas pkc-induced stress-fibre production was not affected by n19-rhoa. we conclude that pkc-delta is located downstream of rhoa and that active rhoa and pkcdelta are both necessary for ltd(4)-induced stress-fibre formation.

TI  == expression and purification of catalytically active, non-toxic endopeptidase derivatives of clostridium botulinum toxin type a.
AB  == clostridium botulinum neurotoxin type a is a potently toxic protein of 150 kda with specific endopeptidase activity for the snare protein snap-25. proteolytic cleavage of bont/a with trypsin leads to removal of the c-terminal domain responsible for neuronal cell binding. removal of this domain result in a catalytically active, non-cell-binding derivative termed lh(n)/a. we have developed a purification scheme to prepare lh(n)/a essentially free of contaminating bont/a. lh(n)/a prepared by this scheme retains full enzymatic activity, is stable in solution, and is of low toxicity as demonstrated in a mouse toxicity assay. in addition, lh(n)/a has minimal effect on release of neurotransmitter from a primary cell culture model. both the mouse bioassay and in vitro release assay suggest bont/a is present at less than 1 in 10(6) molecules of lh(n)/a. this represents a significant improvement on previously reported figures for lh(n)/a, and also the light chain domain, previously purified from bont/a. to complement the preparation of lh(n)/a from holotoxin, dna encoding lh(n)/a has been introduced into escherichia coli to facilitate expression of recombinant product. expression and purification parameters have been developed to enable isolation of soluble, stable endopeptidase with a toxicity profile enhanced on that of lh(n)/a purified from bont/a. the recombinant-derived material has been used to prepare antisera that neutralise a  bont/a challenge. the production of essentially bont/a-free lh(n)/a by two different methods and the possibilities for exploitation are discussed.

TI  == characterization of the enzymatic component of the adp-ribosyltransferase toxin cdta from clostridium difficile.
AB  == certain strains of clostridium difficile produce the adp-ribosyltransferase cdt,  which is a binary actin adp-ribosylating toxin. the toxin consists of the binding component cdtb, which mediates receptor binding and cellular uptake, and the enzyme component cdta. here we studied the enzyme component (cdta) of the toxin using the binding component of clostridium perfringens iota toxin (ib), which is  interchangeable with cdtb as a transport component. ib was used because cdtb was  not expressed as a recombinant protein in escherichia coli. similar to iota toxin, cdta adp-ribosylates nonmuscle and skeletal muscle actin. the n-terminal part of cdta (cdta1-240) competes with full-length cdta for binding to the iota toxin binding component. the c-terminal part (cdta244-263) harbors the enzyme activity but was much less active than the full-length cdta. changes of glu428 and glu430 to glutamine, ser388 to alanine, and arg345 to lysine blocked adp-ribosyltransferase activity. comparison of cdta with c. perfringens iota toxin and clostridium botulinum c2 toxin revealed full enzyme activity of the fragment ia208-413 but loss of activity of several n-terminally deleted c2i proteins including c2i103-431, c2i190-431, and c2i30-431. the data indicate that  cdta belongs to the iota toxin subfamily of binary actin adp-ribosylating toxins  with respect to interaction with the binding component and substrate specificity. it shares typical conserved amino acid residues with iota toxin and c2 toxin that are suggested to be involved in nad-binding and/or catalytic activity. the enzyme components of cdt, iota toxin, and c2 toxin differ with respect to the minimal structural requirement for full enzyme activity.

AB  == the partial sequences (1465 bp) of the 16s rdna of clostridium novyi types a, b and c and clostridium haemolyticum were determined. c. novyi types a, b and c and c. haemolyticum clustered with clostridium botulinum types c and d. moreover, the 16s rdna sequences of c. novyi type b strains and c. haemolyticum strains were completely identical; they differed by 1 bp (level of similarity > 99.9%) from that of c. novyi type c, they were 98.7% homologous to that of c. novyi type a (relative positions 28-1520 of the escherichia coli 16s rdna sequence) and they exhibited a higher similarity to the 16s rdna sequence of c. botulinum types d and c than to that of c. novyi type a. these results suggest that c. novyi types  b and c and c. haemolyticum may be one independent species generated from the same phylogenetic origin.

AB  == native clostridium botulinum gene coding for type a neurotoxin has been used to construct recombinant derivatives coding separately for l and h polypeptide chains of the toxin. the gene derivatives have been cloned into an expression vector pet28b in e. coli bl21 (de3) cells. the recombinant l and h proteins seem  to be the major individual proteins after iptg induction of the recombinant cells. each of the proteins has been accumulated only in inclusion bodies. the recombinant l chain (but not h chain) has been successfully resolubilized. each of the proteins contains six his residues on the n terminus which allows purification on ni-agarose columns with high yield. no toxic effect has been observed for both l and h chains after injection of 10 micrograms of recombinant  preparations purified from inclusion bodies. moreover, the injection resulted in  an increase in the titer of specific antibodies which protected mice from 1 dlm of type a native botulinum neurotoxin. hence, the recombinant neurotoxin protein  derivatives which are present in e. coli inclusion bodies can be a source of material for producing diagnostic and therapeutic sera against type a botulinum neurotoxin.

TI  == small gtpase rho regulates thrombin-induced platelet aggregation.
AB  == platelets play essential roles in hemostasis and thrombosis by aggregating with each other. however, the molecular mechanism governing platelet aggregation is not yet fully understood. here, we established an assay system using platelets permeabilized with streptolysin-o to analyze mechanism of the thrombin-induced aggregation, focusing upon a controversial issue in the field whether small gtpase rho regulates the aggregation. incubation of the permeabilized platelets with rho gdp-dissociation inhibitor, an inhibitory regulator for rho family gtpases, extracted rho family proteins extensively from the plasma and intracellular membranes, and inhibited the thrombin-induced aggregation. incubation of the permeabilized platelets with botulinum exoenzyme c3, which specifically inhibits rho function by adp-ribosylating it, abolished the thrombin-induced aggregation. thus, rho is involved in thrombin-induced aggregation of platelets.

TI  == the c terminus of component c2ii of clostridium botulinum c2 toxin is essential for receptor binding.
AB  == the binary clostridium botulinum c2 toxin consists of two separate proteins, the  binding component c2ii (80.5 kda) and the actin-adp-ribosylating enzyme component c2i (49.4 kda). for its cytotoxic action, c2ii binds to a cell membrane receptor  and induces cell entry of c2i via receptor-mediated endocytosis. here we studied  the structure-function relationship of c2ii by constructing truncated c2ii proteins and producing polyclonal antisera against selective regions of c2ii. an  antibody raised against the c terminus (amino acids 592 to 721) of c2ii inhibited binding of c2ii to cells. the antibody prevented pore formation by c2ii oligomers in artificial membranes but did not influence the properties of existing channels. to further define the region responsible for receptor binding, we constructed proteins with deletions in c2ii; specifically, they lacked amino acid residues 592 to 721 and the 7 c-terminal amino acid residues. the truncated proteins still formed sodium dodecyl sulfate-stable oligomers but were unable to  bind to cells. our data indicate that the c terminus of c2ii mediates binding of  the protein to cells and that the 7 c-terminal amino acids are structurally important for receptor binding.

TI  == tyrosine phosphorylation of the vascular endothelial-growth-factor receptor-2 (vegfr-2) is modulated by rho proteins.
AB  == the effects of rho-specific modifying toxins on the tyrosine phosphorylation of endothelial cell proteins were investigated. incubation of the cells with the rho-activating toxin cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1 (cnf1) induced a marked increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of a number of signalling intermediates  of the vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf)-mediated cascade, including focal adhesion kinase, paxillin, phospholipase cgamma1 and a shc-associated protein of 195 kda. both cnf1- and vegf-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of these proteins were significantly reduced by prior incubation with c3 transferase, a known inhibitor of rhoa function, suggesting a rho-dependent mechanism. the stimulation of endothelial cells with cnf1 resulted in a marked increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of the vegf receptor (vegfr)-2, which was correlated with a stimulation of its kinase activity and with its association with downstream tyrosine phosphorylated proteins. the stimulatory effect of cnf1  was specific for vegfr-2 since the phosphotyrosine content of vegfr-1 was not affected by the toxin. transient overexpression of a dominant-active rhoa mutant  also induced an increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of the vegfr-2, whereas  overexpression of a dominant-inactive form of the protein was without effect. taken together, these results indicate that rho proteins may play an important role in angiogenesis by modulating the tyrosine phosphorylation levels of vegfr-2.

TI  == a rho-related gtpase is involved in ca(2+)-dependent neurotransmitter exocytosis.
AB  == rho, rac, and cdc42 monomeric gtpases are well known regulators of the actin cytoskeleton and phosphoinositide metabolism and have been implicated in hormone  secretion in endocrine cells. here, we examine their possible implication in ca(2+)-dependent exocytosis of neurotransmitters. using subcellular fractionation procedures, we found that rhoa, rhob, rac1, and cdc42 are present in rat brain synaptosomes; however, only rac1 was associated with highly purified synaptic vesicles. to determine the synaptic function of these gtpases, toxins that impair rho-related proteins were microinjected into aplysia neurons. we used lethal toxin from clostridium sordellii, which inactivates rac; toxin b from clostridium difficile, which inactivates rho, rac, and cdc42; and c3 exoenzyme from clostridium botulinum and cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1 from escherichia coli, which mainly affect rho. analysis of the toxin effects on evoked acetylcholine release revealed that a member of the rho family, most likely rac1, was implicated in the control of neurotransmitter release. strikingly, blockage of acetylcholine release by lethal toxin and toxin b could be completely removed in  <1 s by high frequency stimulation of nerve terminals. further characterization of the inhibitory action produced by lethal toxin suggests that rac1 protein regulates a late step in ca(2+)-dependent neuroexocytosis.

TI  == bacterial toxins inhibiting or activating small gtp-binding proteins.
AB  == amino acids located on the switch 1 or switch 2 domains of small gtpases of the ras and rho family are targets of several bacterial toxins. exoenzyme c3 from clostridium botulinum adp-ribosylates specifically rho at r43 and prevents the recruitment of rho on the cell membrane. this blocks the downstream effects of the rho gtpase. however, exoenzyme c3 is not a toxin, and chimeric proteins fusing c3 with the b moiety of either diphtheria toxin or pseudomonas aeruginosa  exotoxin a have been produced to intoxicate cells with low concentration of c3. c. difficile toxin b modifies by glucosylation rho on t37 and rac and cdc42 on t35. glucosylation of rho, rac, and cdc42 blocks the binding of these gtpases on  their downstream effectors. c. sordellii lethal toxin modifies ras, rap, and rac  on t35 by glucosylation. cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1 (cnf1), from uropathogenic escherichia coli strains, deamidates q63 of rho into e63, thereby blocking the intrinsic or gap-mediated gtpase of rho. this allows permanent activation of rho. thus, rho gtpases are targets for three different toxin activities. molecular mechanisms of these toxins are discussed.

AB  == clostridium botulinum exoenzyme c3 inactivates the small gtpase rho by adp-ribosylation. we used a c3 fusion toxin (c2in-c3) with high cell accessibility to study the kinetics of rho inactivation by adp-ribosylation. in primary cultures of rat astroglial cells and chinese hamster ovary cells, c2in-c3 induced the complete adp-ribosylation of rhoa and concomitantly the disassembly of stress fibers within 3 h. removal of c2in-c3 from the medium caused the recovery of stress fibers and normal cell morphology within 4 h. the regeneration was preceded by the appearance of non-adp-ribosylated rhoa. recovery of cell morphology was blocked by the proteasome inhibitor lactacystin and by the translation inhibitors cycloheximide and puromycin, indicating that intracellular degradation of the c3 fusion toxin and the neosynthesis of rho were required for  reversal of cell morphology. escherichia coli cytotoxic necrotizing factor cnf1,  which activates rho by deamidation of gln(63), caused reconstitution of stress fibers and cell morphology in c2in-c3-treated cells within 30-60 min. the effect  of cnf1 was independent of rhoa neosynthesis and occurred in the presence of completely adp-ribosylated rhoa. the data show three novel findings; 1) the cytopathic effects of adp-ribosylation of rho are rapidly reversed by neosynthesis of rho, 2) cnf1-induced deamidation activates adp-ribosylated rho, and 3) inhibition of rho activation but not inhibition of rho-effector interaction is a major mechanism underlying inhibition of cellular functions of rho by adp-ribosylation.

AB  == the mechanism by which platelet-derived growth factor (pdgf) regulates vascular smooth muscle cell (smc) dna synthesis is unknown, but may involve isoprenoid intermediates of the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway. inhibition of isoprenoid synthesis with the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coa reductase inhibitor, simvastatin (sim, 1-10 microm), inhibited pdgf-induced smc dna synthesis by >95%, retinoblastoma gene product hyperphosphorylation by 90%, and cyclin-dependent kinases (cdk)-2, -4, and -6 activity by 80 +/- 5, 50 +/- 3, and 48 +/- 3%, respectively. this correlated with a 20-fold increase in p27(kip1) without changes in p16, p21(waf1), or p53 levels compared with pdgf alone. since ras and  rho require isoprenoid modification for membrane localization and are implicated  in cell cycle regulation, we investigated the effects of sim on ras and rho. up-regulation of p27(kip1) and inhibition of rho but not ras membrane translocation by sim were reversed by geranylgeranylpyrophosphate, but not farnesylpyrophosphate. indeed, inhibition of rho by clostridium botulinum c3 transferase or overexpression of dominant-negative n19rhoa mutant increased p27(kip1) and inhibited retinoblastoma hyperphosphorylation. in contrast, activation of rho by escherichia coli cytotoxic necrotizing factor-1 decreased p27(kip1) and increased smc dna synthesis. these findings indicate that the down-regulation of p27(kip1) by rho gtpase mediates pdgf-induced smc dna synthesis and suggest a novel direct effect of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coa reductase inhibitors on the vascular wall.

TI  == effects of cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1 and lethal toxin on actin cytoskeleton  and ve-cadherin localization in human endothelial cell monolayers.
AB  == integrity of the vascular endothelium is largely dependent on endothelial cell shape and establishment of intercellular junctions. certain pathogenic bacterial  toxins alter the cytoskeletal architecture of intoxicated cells by modulating the gtpase activity of p21 rho family proteins. in the present study we have analyzed the effect of rho-directed toxins on the actin cytoskeleton and monolayer integrity of endothelial cells. we report here that escherichia coli cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1 (cnf1) activates rho in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (huvec). in confluent monolayers, cnf1 treatment induces prominent stress fiber formation without significantly modifying peripheral localization of ve-cadherin, a specific marker of vascular endothelial cell adherens junctions. further, rho activation with cnf1 blocks thrombin-induced redistribution of ve-cadherin staining and gap formation in huvec monolayers. inhibition of rho by  prolonged treatment of cells with c3 exoenzyme (clostridium botulinum) eliminates actin stress fibers without disrupting the continuity of ve-cadherin staining, indicating that rho-dependent stress fibers are not required for maintaining this adhesion receptor at sites of intercellular contact. lethal toxin (clostridium sordellii), an inhibitor of rac as well as ras and rap, potently disrupts the actin microfilament system and monolayer integrity in huvec cultures.

AB  == the mechanism by which 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (hmg)-coa reductase inhibitors  increase endothelial nitric oxide synthase (enos) expression is unknown. to determine whether changes in isoprenoid synthesis affects enos expression, human  endothelial cells were treated with the hmg-coa reductase inhibitor, mevastatin (1-10 microm), in the presence of l-mevalonate (200 microm), geranylgeranylpyrophosphate (ggpp, 1-10 microm), farnesylpyrophosphate (fpp, 5-10 microm), or low density lipoprotein (ldl, 1 mg/ml). mevastatin increased enos mrna and protein levels by 305 +/- 15% and 180 +/- 11%, respectively. co-treatment with l-mevalonate or ggpp, but not fpp or ldl, reversed mevastatin's effects. because rho gtpases undergo geranylgeranyl modification, we investigated whether rho regulates enos expression. immunoblot analyses and [35s]gtpgammas-binding assays revealed that mevastatin inhibited rho membrane translocation and gtp binding activity by 60 +/- 5% and 78 +/- 6%, both of which  were reversed by co-treatment with ggpp but not fpp. furthermore, inhibition of rho by clostridium botulinum c3 transferase (50 microg/ml) or by overexpression of a dominant-negative n19rhoa mutant increased enos expression. in contrast, activation of rho by escherichia coli cytotoxic necrotizing factor-1 (200 ng/ml)  decreased enos expression. these findings indicate that rho negatively regulates  enos expression and that hmg-coa reductase inhibitors up-regulate enos expression by blocking rho geranylgeranylation, which is necessary for its membrane-associated activity.

TI  == regulation of the actin cytoskeleton by thrombin in human endothelial cells: role of rho proteins in endothelial barrier function.
AB  == endothelial barrier function is regulated at the cellular level by cytoskeletal-dependent anchoring and retracting forces. in the present study we have examined the signal transduction pathways underlying agonist-stimulated reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. receptor activation by thrombin, or the thrombin receptor (proteinase-activated receptor 1) agonist peptide, leads to an early increase in  stress fiber formation followed by cortical actin accumulation and cell rounding. selective inhibition of thrombin-stimulated signaling systems, including gi/o (pertussis toxin sensitive), p42/p44, and p38 map kinase cascades, src family kinases, pi-3 kinase, or s6 kinase pathways had no effect on the thrombin response. in contrast, staurosporine and kt5926, an inhibitor of myosin light chain kinase, effectively blocked thrombin-induced cell rounding and retraction.  the contribution of rho to these effects was analyzed by using bacterial toxins that either activate or inhibit the gtpase. escherichia coli cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1, an activator of rho, induced the appearance of dense actin  cables across cells without perturbing monolayer integrity. accordingly, lysophosphatidic acid, an activator of rho-dependent stress fiber formation in fibroblasts, led to reorganization of polymerized actin into stress fibers but failed to induce cell rounding. inhibition of rho with clostridium botulinum exoenzyme c3 fused to the b fragment of diphtheria toxin caused loss of stress fibers with only partial attenuation of thrombin-induced cell rounding. the implication of rac and cdc42 was analyzed in transient transfection experiments using either constitutively active (v12) or dominant-interfering (n17) mutants. expression of racv12 mimicked the effect of thrombin on cell rounding, and racn17 blocked the response to thrombin, whereas cdc42 mutants were without effect. these observations suggest that rho is involved in the maintenance of endothelial barrier function and rac participates in cytoskeletal remodeling by thrombin in human umbilical vein endothelial cells.

AB  == up-regulation of the camp pathway by forskolin or alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone induces melanocyte and melanoma cell differentiation characterized by stimulation of melanin synthesis and dendrite development. here we show that forskolin-induced dendricity is associated to a disassembly of actin stress fibers. since rho controls actin organization, we studied the role of this guanosine triphosphate (gtp)-binding protein in camp-induced dendrite formation.  clostridium botulinum c3 exotransferase, which inhibits rho, mimicked the effect  of forskolin in promoting dendricity and stress fiber disruption, while the escherichia coli toxin cytotoxic necrotizing factor-1 (cnf-1), which activates rho and the expression of a constitutively active rho mutant, blocked forskolin-induced dendrite outgrowth. in addition, overexpression of a constitutively active form of the rho target p160 rho-kinase (p160(rock)) prevented the dendritogenic effects of camp. our results suggest that inhibition  of rho and of its target p160(rock) are required events for camp-induced dendrite outgrowth in b16 cells. furthermore, we present evidence that rho is involved in  the regulation of melanogenesis. indeed, rho inactivation enhanced the camp stimulation of tyrosinase gene transcription and protein expression, while rho constitutive activation impaired these camp-induced effects. this reveals that, in addition to controlling dendricity, rho also participates in the regulation of melanin synthesis by camp.

AB  == novel type lectins were found in the phylum annelida, i.e. in the earthworm, tubifex, leech, and lugworm. the lectins (29-31 kda) were extracted from the worms without the use of detergent and purified by affinity chromatography on asialofetuin-agarose. on the basis of the partial primary structures of the earthworm lumbricus terrestris 29-kda lectin (ew29), degenerate primers were synthesized for use in the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. an amplified 155-base pair fragment was used to screen a cdna library. four types of full-length clones were obtained, all of which encoded 260 amino acids, but which were found to differ at 29 nucleotide positions. since three of them resulted in  non-silent substitutions, ew29 mrna was considered to be a mixture of at least three distinct polynucleotides encoding the following proteins: ala44-gln197-ile213 (clone 5), gly44-gln197-val213 (clone 7), and ala44-his197-ile213 (clones 8 and 9; different at the nucleotide level, but encoding an identical polypeptide). genomic polymerase chain reaction using dna from a single worm revealed that the single worm already had four sets of cdnas.  the ew29 protein showed two features. first, the lectin was composed of two homologous domains (14,500 da) showing 27% identity with each other. when each of the domains was separately expressed in escherichia coli, the c-terminal domain was found to bind to asialofetuin-agarose as strongly as the whole protein, whereas the n-terminal domain did not bind and only retardation was observed. ew29 was found to exist as a monomer under non-denaturing conditions. it had significant hemagglutinating activity, which was inhibited by a wide range of galactose-containing saccharides. second, ew29 contained multiple short conserved motifs, "gly-x-x-x-gln-x-trp." similar motifs have been found in many carbohydrate-recognizing proteins from an extensive variety of organisms, e.g. plant lectin ricin b-chain and clostridium botulinum 33-kda hemagglutinin. therefore, these carbohydrate-recognition proteins appear to form a protein superfamily.

AB  == in the past decade, outbreaks of human illness associated with the consumption of raw vegetables and fruits (or unpasteurized products produced from them) have increased in the united states. changes in agronomic, harvesting, distribution, processing, and consumption patterns and practices have undoubtedly contributed to this increase. pathogens such as listeria monocytogenes, clostridium botulinum, and bacillus cereus are naturally present in some soil, and their presence on fresh produce is not rare. salmonella, escherichia coli o157:h7, campylobacter jejuni, vibrio cholerae, parasites, and viruses are more likely to  contaminate fresh produce through vehicles such as raw or improperly composted manure, irrigation water containing untreated sewage, or contaminated wash water. contact with mammals, reptiles, fowl, insects, and unpasteurized products of animal origin offers another avenue through which pathogens can access produce. surfaces, including human hands, which come in contact with whole or cut produce  represent potential points of contamination throughout the total system of growing, harvesting, packing, processing, shipping, and preparing produce for consumption. treatment of produce with chlorinated water reduces populations of pathogenic and other microorganisms on fresh produce but cannot eliminate them. reduction of risk for human illness associated with raw produce can be better achieved through controlling points of potential contamination in the field; during harvesting; during processing or distribution; or in retail markets, food-service facilities, or the home.

TI  == recombinant snap-25 is an effective substrate for clostridium botulinum type a toxin endopeptidase activity in vitro.
AB  == bacterial neurotoxins are now being used routinely for the treatment of neuromuscular conditions. alternative assays to replace or to complement in vivo  bioassay methods for assessment of the safety and potency of these botulinum neurotoxin-based therapeutic products are urgently needed. advances made in understanding the mode of action of clostridial neurotoxins have provided the basis for the development of alternative mechanism-based assay methods. thus, the identification of snap-25 (synaptosomal-associated protein of molecular mass 25 kda) as the intracellular protein target which is selectively cleaved during poisoning by botulinum neurotoxin type a (bont/a) has enabled the development of  a functional in vitro assay for this toxin. using recombinant dna methods, a segment of snap-25 (aa residues 134-206) spanning the toxin cleavage site was prepared as a fusion protein to the maltose-binding protein in escherichia coli.  the fusion protein was purified by affinity chromatography and the fragment isolated after cleavage with factor xa. targeted antibodies specific for the n and c termini of snap-25, as well as the toxin cleavage site, were prepared and used in an immunoassay to demonstrate bont/a endopeptidase activity towards recombinant snap-25 substrates. the reaction required low concentrations of reducing agents which were inhibitory at higher concentrations as were metal chelators and some inhibitors of metallopeptidases. the endopeptidase assay has proved to be more sensitive than the mouse bioassay for detection of toxin in therapeutic preparations. a good correlation with results obtained in the in vivo bioassay (r = 0.95, n = 23) was demonstrated. the endopeptidase assay described here may provide a suitable replacement assay for the estimation of the potency of type a toxin in therapeutic preparations.

TI  == role of rho protein in lovastatin-induced breakdown of actin cytoskeleton.
AB  == the rho gtpases are involved in actin cytoskeleton organization and signal transduction. they need polyisoprenylation for membrane association and activation. lovastatin, a hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme a inhibitor, prevents isoprene synthesis and thereby lipid modification of the rho protein carboxy terminus. because lovastatin causes rounding up of cultured cells, we investigated whether the compound acts on the actin cytoskeleton through rho proteins. lovastatin treatment decreased f-actin content in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. g-actin content remained unchanged. in lovastatin-treated nih 3t3 cells, the amount of rho protein which was adp-ribosylated by clostridium botulinum exoenzyme c3 decreased in membranes and  increased in the cytosol fraction. cycloheximide prevented lovastatin-induced rounding up of cells. however, after microinjection or direct application of exoenzyme c3, cells treated with cycloheximide and lovastatin rounded up again. on the contrary, lovastatin-treated, round swiss 3t3 cells reverted to a flat morphology when microinjected with dominant active rhoa (val14rhoa). escherichia  coli cytotoxic necrotizing factor (cnf1) which activates rho proteins caused flattening of round, lovastatin-treated nih 3t3 cells. these results suggest that lovastatin affects the actin cytoskeleton through inactivation of rho proteins.

TI  == induction of an immune response by oral administration of recombinant botulinum toxin.
AB  == a gene encoding the full-size botulinum neurotoxin serotype c was reconstructed in vector pqe-30 and expressed at high levels in escherichia coli. three amino acid mutations (h229-->g, e230-->t, and h233-->n) were generated in the zinc-binding motif, resulting in complete detoxification of the modified recombinant holotoxin. the pcr-amplified wild-type light chain of botulinum neurotoxin serotype c was also expressed in e. coli and used as a control in all  experiments. modified recombinant holotoxin and light chain contained a histidine affinity tag at the amino terminus, which was used for detection and purification. recombinant proteins were purified on nickel affinity resin and analyzed by western blotting with the anti-histidine tag and anti-neurotoxin c antibodies. the results indicated that the 150-kda molecule of modified recombinant holotoxin and the 50-kda recombinant light chain were synthesized without degradation; however, e. coli did not provide for efficient nicking of modified recombinant toxin. modified recombinant holotoxin was not toxic to mice, had no effect on nerve-evoked muscle twitch in vitro, and was not able to cleave  syntaxin in crude synaptosome preparations. the recombinant light chain was also  nontoxic in vivo, had no effect on evoked muscle twitch, but was able to cleave syntaxin. modified recombinant neurotoxin and light chain were administered to animals either orally or subcutaneously. both oral administration and subcutaneous administration of modified recombinant neurotoxin evoked high levels of serum antibodies and protective immunity. oral administration of recombinant light chain evoked no systemic response, whereas subcutaneous administration evoked antibody production and immunity.

TI  == cleavage of the synaptobrevin/vesicle-associated membrane protein (vamp) of the mouse brain by the recombinant light chain of clostridium botulinum type b toxin.
AB  == the light chain of clostridium botulinum type b toxin was expressed in escherichia coli using the expression vector pet-3a containing phage t7 promoter. the expressed protein was then purified by deae-cellulose and phosphocellulose chromatography and the proteolytic activity of the purified light chain was studied. the purified recombinant light chain cleaved synaptobrevin when mixed with the mouse brain microsome and the proteolytic activity of the light chain was inhibited if a metal chelating agent such as edta or 2,2'-dipyridyl was added. the recombinant light chain cleaved synaptobrevin more effectively than the native type b toxin. when the native toxin was trypinized and was reduced with dtt, its proteolytic activity was similar to that of the recombinant light chain.

TI  == cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1 from escherichia coli and dermonecrotic toxin from bordetella bronchiseptica induce p21(rho)-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase and paxillin in swiss 3t3 cells.
AB  == treatment of swiss 3t3 cells with cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1 (cnf1) from escherichia coli and dermonecrotic toxin (dnt) from bordetella bronchiseptica, which directly target and activate p21(rho), stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation  of focal adhesion kinase (p125(fak)) and paxillin. tyrosine phosphorylation induced by cnf1 and dnt occurred after a pronounced lag period (2 h), and was blocked by either lysosomotrophic agents or incubation at 22 degrees c. cnf1 and  dnt stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of p125(fak) and paxillin, actin stress fiber formation, and focal adhesion assembly with similar kinetics. cytochalasin  d and high concentrations of platelet-derived growth factor disrupted the actin cytoskeleton and completely inhibited cnf1 and dnt induced tyrosine phosphorylation. microinjection of clostridium botulinum c3 exoenzyme which adp-ribosylates and inactivates p21(rho) function, prevented tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion proteins in response to either cnf1 or dnt. in  addition, our results demonstrated that cnf1 and dnt do not induce protein kinase c activation, inositol phosphate formation, and ca2+ mobilization. moreover, cnf1 and dnt stimulated dna synthesis without activation of p42(mapk) and p44(mapk) providing additional evidence for a novel p21(rho)-dependent signaling pathway that leads to entry into the s phase of the cell cycle in swiss 3t3.

TI  == mapping of protective and cross-reactive domains of the type a neurotoxin of clostridium botulinum.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to identify the location of domains within the serotype a neurotoxin of clostridium botulinum (bont/a) that conferred protection against botulism. the bont/a gene was subcloned into a series of 10 overlapping fragments that were expressed in escherichia coli. the expressed proteins were partially purified and used to immunize mice. the resulting antisera were screened by immunoblotting analysis for the presence of bont/a-specific antibody. all fragments, except one, elicited antibody that recognized bont/a in an immunoblot. serological screening identified several fragment-specific cross-reactive epitopes that were shared by heterologous serotypes of bont. most  of these epitopes immunoreactive by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, but not by immunoblot. only two fragments were shown to confer protection against bont/a intoxication. both of these proteins were derived from segments of the heavy chain and encoded amino acid residues h455-661 and h1150-1289 of bont/a.

TI  == surveillance for foodborne-disease outbreaks--united states, 1988-1992.
AB  == problem/condition: since 1973, cdc has maintained a collaborative surveillance program for collection and periodic reporting of data concerning the occurrence and causes of foodborne-disease outbreaks (fbdos). reporting period covered: this summary reviews data from january 1988 through december 1992. description of system: the surveillance system reviews data concerning fbdos--defined as the occurrence of two or more cases of a similar illness resulting from the ingestion of a common food. before 1992, only one case of intoxication by chemical, marine  toxin, or clostridium botulinum toxin as a result of the ingestion of food was required to constitute an fbdo. since 1992, two or more cases have been required. state and local public health departments have primary responsibility for the identifying and investigating fbdos. state and territorial health departments report these outbreaks to cdc on a standard form. results: during 1988-1992, a total of 2,423 outbreaks of foodborne disease were reported (451 in 1988, 505 in  1989, 532 in 1990, 528 in 1991, and 407 in 1992). these outbreaks caused a reported 77,373 persons to become ill. among outbreaks for which the etiology was determined, bacterial pathogens caused the largest percentage of outbreaks (79%)  and the largest percentage of cases (90%). salmonella serotype enteritidis accounted for the largest number of outbreaks, cases, and deaths; most of these outbreaks were attributed to eating undercooked, infected eggs. chemical agents caused 14% of outbreaks and 2% of cases; parasites, 2% of outbreaks and 1% of cases; and viruses, 4% of outbreaks and 6% of cases. interpretation: the number of fbdos reported per year did not change substantially during the first 4 years  but declined in 1992 as a result of the revised definition of an outbreak. during this reporting period, s. enteritidis continued to be a major cause of morbidity  and mortality. in addition, multistate outbreaks caused by contaminated produce and outbreaks caused by escherichia coli o157:h7 became more prominent. actions taken: state and local public health departments investigate fbdos. at the regional and national level, surveillance data provide an indication of the etiologic agents, vehicles of transmission, and contributing factors associated with fbdos and help direct public health actions.

TI  == evidence that arg-295, glu-378, and glu-380 are active-site residues of the adp-ribosyltransferase activity of iota toxin.
AB  == the active site of the enzymatic component (ia) of the clostridium perfringens iota toxin has been studied by site-directed mutagenesis. sequence alignment showed that ia and c3 enzymes display a segment in their c-terminal part which is homologous to that forming the active domain of pertussis toxin, cholera toxin, and escherichia coli thermolabile toxins. this structure consists of a beta-strand and an alpha-helix which forms the nad-binding cavity and which is flanked by two catalytic spatially conserved residues involved in catalysis [domenighini et al. (1994) mol. microbiol. 14, 41-50]. substitutions (arg-295-lys, glu-378-ala, glu-380-asp, and glu-380-ala) induced a drastic decrease in adp-ribosylation and cytotoxic activities, while substitution of the  adjacent arg (arg-296-lys) only partially affected the enzymatic activity and cytotoxicity. these results indicate that arg-295, glu-378 and glu-380 of ia are  involved in the adp-ribosylation activity which is essential for the morphological changes of cells treated with iota toxin.

TI  == inhibition of nad+ glycohydrolase and adp-ribosyl cyclase activities of leukocyte cell surface antigen cd38 by gangliosides.
AB  == we have recently reported that gangliosides act as inhibitors of adp-ribosyltransferases and nad+ glycohydrolases (nadase) of pertussis toxin and  the c3 exoenzyme from clostridium botulinum (hara-yokoyama, m., hirabayashi, y.,  irie, f., syuto, b., moriishi, k., sugiya, h., and furuyama, s. (1995) j. biol. chem. 270, 8115-8121). here, we investigated the effect of gangliosides on the enzymatic activity of leukocyte cell surface antigen cd38, which is identified as an ecto-nadase (kontani, k., nishina, h., ohoka, y., takahashi, k., and katada, t. (1993) j. biol. chem. 268, 16895-16898). gangliosides gm1a and gq1balpha inhibited the nadase activity in the immunoprecipitate of anti-cd38 antibody from the membrane extract of retinoic acid-treated human leukemic hl-60 cells. gangliosides also inhibited the nadase activity of the extracellular domain of cd38 antigen that was deprived of the transmembrane domain and was expressed in escherichia coli as a fusion protein with maltose-binding protein (mbp-cd38). the order of the inhibitory effect of purified ganglioside species on the nadase activity on mbp-cd38 was as follows: gq1balpha > gt1b, gq1b > gd1a, gd1b, gm1a, gm1b, gd3, gm3. gq1balpha inhibited the nadase of mbp-cd38 in a noncompetitive manner versus nad+ with a ki value of about 0.3 microm. neither ceramide nor the  oligosaccharide moiety of gq1balpha had an effect on the nadase activity. gq1balpha, gt1b, and gq1b also efficiently inhibited the adp-ribosyl cyclase activity of mbp-cd38. at present, gangliosides are the only endogenous species that can block the enzymatic activity of cd38 antigen. the present results suggest a potential role of gangliosides as inhibitors of the ecto-nadases.

AB  == clostridium limosum adp-ribosyltransferase modifies low molecular mass gtp-binding proteins of the rho subtype family. here we cloned and sequenced the  gene of the transferase and expressed it in escherichia coli. the gene encodes a  protein of 250 amino acids (m(r) = 27,840), with a putative signal peptide of 45  amino acids, that shows about 60-65% identity with c3 transferases from clostridium botulinum. the mature c. limosum transferase was expressed as a maltose-binding fusion protein in e. coli and purified to apparent homogeneity. to study the functional role of glu174 of c. limosum transferase, which was recently photoaffinity-labeled with [carbonyl-14c]nad [jung, m., et al. (1993) j. biol. chem. 268, 23215-23218], two mutants e174d and e174q were constructed by a  polymerase chain reaction-based system. the e174d and e174q mutants showed a dramatic decrease in kcat, but no major changes in km,nad. furthermore, replacement of glu174 by aspartic acid and glutamine largely reduced and completely blocked uv-induced incorporation of [carbonyl-14c]nad into the transferase. the data indicate that glu174 is an active site residue of c. limosum transferase.

TI  == synergistic activation of rat brain phospholipase d by adp-ribosylation factor and rhoa p21, and its inhibition by clostridium botulinum c3 exoenzyme.
AB  == an activator of rat brain phospholipase d (pld) that is distinct from the already identified pld activator, adp-ribosylation factor (arf), was partially purified from bovine brain cytosol by a series of chromatographic steps. the partially purified preparation contained a 22-kda substrate for clostridium botulinum c3 exoenzyme adp-ribosyltransferase, which strongly reacted with anti-rhoa p21 antibody, but not with anti-rac1 p21 or anti-cdc42hs p21 antibody. treatment of the partially purified pld-activating factor with both c3 exoenzyme and nad significantly inhibited the pld-stimulating activity. these results suggest that  rhoa p21 is, at least in part, responsible for the pld-stimulating activity in the preparation. recombinant isoprenylated rhoa p21 expressed in and purified from sf9 cells activated rat brain pld in a concentration- and gtp gamma s (guanosine 5'-o-(3-thiotriphosphate))-dependent manner. in contrast, recombinant  non-isoprenylated rhoa p21 (fused to glutathione s-transferase) expressed in escherichia coli failed to activate the pld. this difference cannot be explained  by a lower affinity of non-isoprenylated rhoa p21 for gtp gamma s, as the rates of [35s]gtp gamma s binding were very similar for both recombinant preparations and the gtp gamma s-bound form of non-isoprenylated rhoa p21 did not induce pld activation. interestingly, recombinant isoprenylated rhoa p21 and arf synergistically activated rat brain pld; a similar pattern was seen with the partially purified pld-activating factor. the synergistic activation was inhibited by c3 exoenzyme-catalyzed adp-ribosylation of recombinant isoprenylated rhoa p21 in a nad-dependent manner. inhibition correlated with the extent of adp-ribosylation. these findings suggest that rhoa p21 regulates rat brain pld in concert with arf, and that isoprenylation of rhoa p21 is essential for pld regulation in vitro.

TI  == detection of arginine-adp-ribosylated protein using recombinant adp-ribosylarginine hydrolase.
AB  == we made use of adp-ribosylarginine hydrolase to detect arginine-adp- ribosylated  proteins. the hydrolase was expressed in escherichia coli as a protein fused with glutathione s-transferase (gst). the fusion protein gst-adp-ribosylarginine hydrolase catalyzed the hydrolysis of alpha-adp-ribosylarginine to produce adp-ribose and arginine. casein adp-ribosylated with [32p]nad and chicken heterophil arginine-specific adp-ribosyltransferase served as a substrate for the recombinant adp-ribosylarginine hydrolase and the released adp-ribose was determined. protein adp-ribosylated by cholera toxin could serve as substrate of  the hydrolase but protein adp-ribosylated by pertussis toxin, diphtheria toxin, or c(3) enzyme of clostridium botulinum could not. the hydrolase did not release  the radioactivity incorporated into isolated rat liver nuclei incubated with [(32)p]nad or in bovine brain cytosol incubated with [(32)p]adp-ribose. in homogenate of mouse heart which contained arginine-specific adp-ribosyltransferase, labeling of a 55-kda protein by incubation with [(32)p]nad was removed by adp-ribosylarginine hydrolase treatment; hence, the specific hydrolysis of adp-ribose-arginine bond by gst-adp-ribosylarginine hydrolase can be used to detect the arginine-adp-ribosylated proteins in crude preparations. arginine--adp-ribosylated proteins in crude preparations. arginine-adp-ribosylated proteins in mouse spleen lymphocytes were identified using this method.

TI  == escherichia coli cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1: evidence for induction of actin  assembly by constitutive activation of the p21 rho gtpase.
AB  == cytotoxic necrotizing factor type 1 (cnf1) induces in hep-2 cells an increase in  f-actin structures, which was detectable by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis 24 h after addition of this factor to the culture medium. increase in f-actin was correlated with the augmentation of both the cell volume and the total cell actin content. actin assembly-disassembly is controlled by small gtp-binding proteins of the rho family, which have been reported recently to be modified by cnf1 treatment. clostridium difficile toxin b and clostridium botulinum exoenzyme c3, both known to act on the rho gtpase, were used as biological tools to study the effect of cnf1 on this protein. cnf1 incubated before, during, or after exposure to the chimeric toxin c3b (which is the product of a genetic fusion between the dna coding for c3 and the one coding for the b fragment of diphtheria toxin) protected hep-2 cells from the disruption of f-actin structures caused by inactivation of the rho gtpase through its adp-ribosylation. on the other hand, c. difficile toxin b cytopathic effect was not observed upon preincubation of cells with cnf1. toxins acting through a rho-independent mechanism, such as cytochalasin d and clostridium spiroforme iota-like toxin, could not be modified in their cellular activities by cnf1 treatment. all of our results suggest that cnf1 modifies the rho molecule, thus probably protecting this gtpase from further bacterial toxin modification.

TI  == a chimeric toxin to study the role of the 21 kda gtp binding protein rho in the control of actin microfilament assembly.
AB  == we have developed a new tool for studying the role of rho in actin stress fibre formation. clostridium botulinum exoenzyme c3 which affects actin microfilament assembly by adp-ribosylation of p21 rho was genetically fused in various ways to  diphtheria toxin (dt). the resulting chimeric toxins were tested on vero cells. chimeras of c3 and both the a and b fragments of diphtheria toxin had reduced cell binding activities but were apparently able to penetrate into vero cells by  the same mechanism as dt. upon exposure to low ph, dc3b, a fusion protein of c3 and dt b fragment, had a high affinity for the dt receptor, but was apparently not able to translocate to the cytosol upon acidification. in spite of this, addition of picomolar concentrations of dc3b to the growth medium caused disruption of the cell microfilament system associated with vinculin and blocked  cell growth efficiently, indicating that the c3 part of dc3b reached the cytosol, albeit by a different mechanism than that of whole diphtheria toxin. the chimeric dc3b toxin was also applied to vero cells infected by listeria monocytogenes, a pathogenic bacterium that uses an unknown mechanism of actin polymerization to move rapidly in the cytosol. dc3b inhibited the bacterially induced microfilament assembly indicating that l. monocytogenes utilizes a cellular rho dependent mechanism in this process.

AB  == the large-subunit ribosomal ribonucleic acid (23s rrna) genes of non-proteolytic  (group ii) strains of clostridium botulinum toxin types b, e and f were amplified using the polymerase chain reaction (pcr), and cloned in escherichia coli. sequence determination showed that the 23s rrna genes were 2910 nucleotides in length, and comparative analysis revealed approximately 99.5% sequence similarity. the 23s rrna gene sequence of a strain phenotypically resembling non-proteolytic c. botulinum, except in not producing botulinal neurotoxin, was also determined and displayed 99.5% sequence similarity with those from toxigenic strains. a diagnostic sequence within the 23s rrna characteristic for non-proteolytic c. botulinum was identified and used for the design of an oligonucleotide probe. molecular hybridizations with pcr-amplified rdna targets provided a precise and reliable method of identifying non-proteolytic (or group ii) c. botulinum and closely related non-toxigenic strains.

TI  == susceptibility to infection in relation to sids.
AB  == because there is little evidence that invasive bacterial diseases contribute to cot deaths, most studies on infectious causes of sids have focused on viruses or  toxin producing bacteria. although epidemiological studies found marginally significant associations between influenza virus and sids, respiratory syncytial  virus (rsv) was isolated from 90% of older infants with sids. there are conflicting reports that some toxigenic bacteria (clostridium botulinum, clostridium difficle, enterotoxigenic escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus) might be implicated in cot deaths. s aureus are common micro-organisms and their  toxins are very powerful. as the pyrogenic toxic shock syndrome toxin of s aureus can kill a previously healthy adult, it might easily kill a small infant. based on our studies on susceptibility of infants to other infections, we suggest the following might be factors leading to colonisation of infants by toxin producing  s aureus: the lewis blood group antigen appears to act as a receptor for some micro-organisms. epithelial cells expressing high concentrations of lewis bound appreciably more toxin producing s aureus than cells expressing low concentrations of the antigen. lewis is expressed in secretions of nearly 90% of  infants aged 3 months, the peak age for sids. rsv infects about 50% of infants by the first year of life and it is often isolated from infants with sids. studies in our laboratory indicate that rsv infected hep-2 cells bind more toxin producing s aureus than uninfected controls.

TI  == the complete amino acid sequence of the clostridium botulinum type d neurotoxin,  deduced by nucleotide sequence analysis of the encoding phage d-16 phi genome.
AB  == the complete nucleotide sequence of clostridium botulinum type d strain cb16 neurotoxin was determined and the deduced amino acid sequence is reported here for the first time. the structure and function of botulinum type d neurotoxin is  discussed from a molecular biological viewpoint. dna was extracted from toxin-converting phage d-16 phi of c. botulinum type d strain cb16, and a fragment (about 10 kbp) coding for the neurotoxin was cloned into escherichia coli using lambda gt11. a 21-mer oligonucleotide which corresponds to phe7 to val13 of the partial amino acid sequence near the n-terminus of the type d neurotoxin was synthesized and used as a probe to identify the gene encoding type d neurotoxin. the nucleotide sequence contained a single open reading frame coding for 1,275 amino acids (molecular weight of 146,785) and the deduced amino  acid sequence corresponded exactly to the partial amino acid sequences determined by direct microsequencing of the neurotoxin fragments. in the dichain molecule of the neurotoxin, thr2 and asn443 formed the n-termini of the light chain (m.w. 50,410) and heavy chain (m.w. 96,394) respectively, and these two chains were linked with a disulfide bond between cys437 on the light chain and cys450 on the  heavy chain. the nucleotide sequence of the d-cb16 neurotoxin differed from that  previously reported for type d neurotoxin by three nucleotides.

TI  == posttranslational isoprenylation of rho protein is a prerequisite for its interaction with mastoparan and other amphiphilic agents.
AB  == the amphiphilic agents melittin, compound 48/80 and mastoparan inhibit adp-ribosylation of porcine brain rho protein by clostridium botulinum exoenzyme  c3. however, adp-ribosylation of recombinant rhoa expressed in e.coli was not inhibited by these agents. accordingly, steady state gtp hydrolysis by recombinant rhoa was not stimulated by mastoparan, whereas gtp hydrolysis by porcine brain rho was stimulated 2.5-fold in the presence of this wasp venom. after microinjection of recombinant rhoa into xenopus laevis oocytes the inhibitory effect of mastoparan on c3 adp-ribosylation was restored. the data suggest that the amphiphilic agents tested are only active at the posttranslationally processed form of rho and that they exert their effects via the c-terminal end.

TI  == rac1, a low-molecular-mass gtp-binding-protein with high intrinsic gtpase activity and distinct biochemical properties.
AB  == rac1, a member of the family of low-molecular-mass gtp-binding proteins, functions in phagocytic leukocytes as a component necessary for activation of the respiratory burst. to characterize the biochemical properties of rac1, the protein was expressed as a fusion protein in escherichia coli and purified to greater than 99% homogeneity by affinity chromatography. rac1 protein bound maximally bound and hydrolyzed gtp under low free-mg2+ concentrations. under those conditions, (45 nm free mg2+), purified rac1 exhibited a steady-state gtpase activity of 18 nmol.min-1.mg protein-1 (turnover number approximately 0.39 min-1 at 37 degrees c), which is 40-fold higher than h-ras. the high intrinsic gtpase activity of rac1 under low free mg2+ was mainly due to an increased kcat,  the rate constant for hydrolysis of bound gtp, which was 0.29 min-1 for rac1 vs 0.007 min-1 for h-ras (at 20 degrees c). rac1 also released bound gdp faster than h-ras (koff.gdp = 1.02 min-1 for rac1 vs 0.33 min-1 for h-ras at 20 degrees c). in contrast, rac1 released bound guanosine 5'-[gamma-thio]triphosphate (gtp[s]) at a slower rate than h-ras (koff.gtp[s] approximately 0.04 min-1 for rac1 vs 0.31 min-1 for h-ras at 20 degrees c). rac1 was a very good substrate for in vitro geranylgeranylation (c20) but not for farnesylation (c15), whereas the converse is true for h-ras. surprisingly, rac1 was a very poor substrate for in vitro adp-ribosylation by the c3 component of clostridium botulinum toxin compared to rhoa. as a further characterization of rac1, a mutant was made in which the thr115 was replaced by asparagine. this protein (referred to as [thr115----asn]rac1) contains the consensus amino acids of all four gtp-binding domains of h-ras. the koff.gdp of [thr115----asn]rac1 was reduced to that of h-ras, but [thr115----asn]rac1 exhibited essentially identical kcat (0.13 min-1 at 20 degrees c) and koff-gtp[s] (0.03 min-1 at 20 degrees c) values as the wild-type protein. thus, the region(s) in rac1 which control the dissociation of  gtp[s] (and presumably gtp) do not entirely coincide with those controlling gdp dissociation. biochemical analysis of [thr115----asn]rac1 also suggests that the  region responsible for the increased kcat of rac1 is not within the consensus amino acids of the four guanine-nucleotide-binding domains.

TI  == clostridium botulinum c3 adp-ribosyltransferase gene. cloning, sequencing, and expression of a functional protein in escherichia coli.
AB  == c3 adp-ribosyltransferase is an exoenzyme produced by certain strains of clostridium botulinum types c and d, which specifically adp-ribosylates rho and rac proteins in eukaryotic cells. the enzyme was purified from a culture filtrate of c. botulinum type c strain 003-9, and the amino acid sequence from the amino-terminal ser to asn192 was determined by edman degradation. using a set of  degenerate primers based on the sequence, we amplified a part of the gene for this enzyme by polymerase chain reaction. a 2.1-kilobase pair hincii fragment of  c. botulinum dna containing the whole structural gene was then identified by southern analysis with the polymerase chain reaction product as a probe, and the  complete nucleotide structure of the gene together with flanking regions was determined by cloning and dna sequencing the hincii fragment. the gene encodes a  protein of 244 amino acids with a mr of 27,362 which begins with a putative signal peptide of 40 amino acids. escherichia coli carrying this gene produced the active enzyme, and about 60% of it was found in the culture medium. immunoblot analysis with antiserum against the enzyme revealed the presence of two immunoreactive proteins of 27 and 23 kda in the cytoplasmic/membrane fraction and only the 23-kda protein in the periplasm and the medium, suggesting that the  enzyme expressed is processed in the e. coli, exported into the periplasm and released into the culture medium.

TI  == characterization of the c3 gene of clostridium botulinum types c and d and its expression in escherichia coli.
AB  == clostridium botulinum type c and d strains produce exoenzyme c3, which adp-ribosylates the rho protein, a 21-kda regulatory gtp-binding protein. in a previous work, we demonstrated that the c3 gene is encoded by bacteriophages c and d of c. botulinum by using dna-dna hybridizations with oligonucleotides deduced from the c3 protein n-terminal sequence. the c3 coding gene was cloned and sequenced, but its upstream dna region could not be studied because of its instability in escherichia coli. in this work, the upstream dna region of the c3  gene was directly amplified by the polymerase chain reaction and sequenced. the c3 gene encodes a polypeptide of 251 amino acids (27,823 da) consisting of a 40-amino-acid signal peptide and a mature protein of 211 amino acids (23,546 da). the c3 mature protein was expressed in e. coli under the control of the trc promoter. the recombinant polypeptide obtained was recognized by c3 antibodies and adp-ribosylated the rho protein. the c3 gene nucleotide sequence is identical on c and d phage dnas. at the amino acid sequence level, no similarity was found  among c3, other adp-ribosylating toxins, or tetanus or botulinal a, c1, and d neurotoxins.

AB  == the psam2 element of streptomyces ambofaciens integrates site-specifically in the genome of different streptomyces species by recombination between a 58 bp sequence common to the plasmid (attp) and the chromosome (attb). southern hybridization analysis showed that sequences similar to the psam2 attb site were  found in other actinomycetes (mycobacterium, nocardia, micromonospora) as well as unrelated bacteria (bacillus circulans, escherichia coli, clostridium botulinum,  bordetella pertussis, and legionella pneumophila). hybridizing fragments from b.  circulans and mycobacterium tuberculosis were cloned and sequenced. comparison of these sequences with the sequence of the integration zone of s. ambofaciens revealed a conserved region of 76 bp which overlapped with the attb site. this conserved sequence was similar to the salmonella typhimurium and e. coli trna(pro1) genes as well as a number of eucaryotic trna genes and had a proline-trna-like cloverleaf structure. furthermore, the streptomyces lividans attb site of the streptomyces glaucescens element pij408 was also found to overlap a potential trna gene (trna(thr)). we note here that these two putative trna genes as well as those which overlap the attb site of the elements slp1 of streptomyces coelicolor and pmea100 of nocardia mediterranei all contain the site where integrative recombination takes place. these presumptive actinomycete trna  genes lack the 3' terminal cca sequence found in most procaryotic trna genes.

TI  == the complete sequence of botulinum neurotoxin type a and comparison with other clostridial neurotoxins.
AB  == the seven serologically different botulinum neurotoxins are highly potent protein toxins that inhibit neurotransmitter release from peripheral cholinergic synapses. the activated toxins consist of the toxifying a-subunits (mr approximately 50,000) linked by a disulfide bond to the receptor-binding bc-subunits (mr approximately 100,000). we have established the complete sequence of botulinum neurotoxin type a (bont/a; 1,296 amino acid residues, mr = 149,425)  and a partial sequence of botulinum neurotoxin type e (273 amino acid residues) as deduced from the corresponding nucleotide sequences of the chromosomally located structural genes. the promoter of the bont/a gene is inactive in escherichia coli. primer extension experiments indicated that initiation of transcription of the bont/a gene occurred 118 nucleotides upstream from the atg codon. a comparison of the protein sequence revealed an overall identity of 33.8% to that of tetanus toxin. no significant similarity to other known proteins including adp-ribosylating toxins could be detected. three of the six histidine residues of the a-subunit of bont/a were found in the peptide sequence h223elihxxh230 within a domain of predicted alpha-helical secondary structure. this motif is also found in similar positions of the a-subunits of tetanus toxin  and bont/e.

TI  == tetanus toxin: primary structure, expression in e. coli, and homology with botulinum toxins.
AB  == a pool of synthetic oligonucleotides was used to identify the gene encoding tetanus toxin on a 75-kbp plasmid from a toxigenic non-sporulating strain of clostridium tetani. the nucleotide sequence contained a single open reading frame coding for 1315 amino acids corresponding to a polypeptide with a mol. wt of 150,700. in the mature toxin molecule, proline (2) and serine (458) formed the n  termini of the 52,288 mol. wt light chain and the 98,300 mol. wt heavy chain, respectively. cysteine (467) was involved in the disulfide linkage between the two subchains. the amino acid sequences of the tetanus toxin revealed striking homologies with the partial amino acid sequences of botulinum toxins a, b, and e, indicating that the neurotoxins from c. tetani and c. botulinum are derived from  a common ancestral gene. overlapping peptides together covering the entire tetanus toxin molecule were synthesized in escherichia coli and identified by monoclonal antibodies. the promoter of the toxin gene was localized in a region extending 322 bp upstream from the atg codon and was shown to be functional in e. coli.

TI  == [recent advances in the molecular mechanism of action of bacterial toxins, in particular of diphtheria, cholera, coli, botulinum and shigella toxins as well as tetanospasmin and the toxins of staphylococcus aureus].
AB  == great progress was achieved in the clarification of the molecular structure and the mechanism of action of the toxins of pathogenic forms of bacteria. proportions of toxins of corynebacterium diphtheriae and of pseudomonas aeruginosa transfer from the nad and adp-ribose protein to an amino acid of the elongation factor 2. thus the protein synthesis is much inhibited. the cholera toxin and the l-toxin from escherichia coli have a similar structure. they transfer an adp-ribose portion from nad to the gtp-protein of the adenylate cyclase complex, by which means the gtpase activity is reduced. the increase of the camp content leads to an increase of the permeability of the cells of the intestinal epithelium. the tetanospasmin decreases the production of the inhibitingly acting neurotransmitters ( glycin ) from intermediate neurons and thus evokes spasms. the botulinum toxin inhibits the release of acetylcholine from the motor end-plates and leads to paralyses. staphylococcus aureus and clostridium perfringens form among others cytolysins which are injurious to membranes.
