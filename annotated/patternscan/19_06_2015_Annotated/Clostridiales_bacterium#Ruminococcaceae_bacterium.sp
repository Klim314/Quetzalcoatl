TI  == gut microbiota: its role in hepatic encephalopathy.
AB  == ammonia, a key factor in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy (he), is predominantly derived from urea breakdown by urease producing large intestinal bacteria and from small intestine and kidneys, where the enzyme glutaminases releases ammonia from circulating glutamine. non-culture techniques like pyrosequencing of bacterial 16s ribosomal ribonucleic acid are used to characterize fecal microbiota. fecal microbiota in patients with cirrhosis have been shown to alter with increasing child-turcotte-pugh (ctp) and model for end stage liver disease (meld) scores, and with development of covert or overt he. cirrhosis dysbiosis ratio (cdr), the ratio of autochthonous/good bacteria (e.g. lachnospiraceae, ruminococcaceae and clostridiales) to non-autochthonous/pathogenic bacteria (e.g. enterobacteriaceae and streptococcaceae), is significantly higher in controls and patients with compensated cirrhosis than patients with decompensated cirrhosis. although their  stool microbiota do not differ, sigmoid colonic mucosal microbiota in liver cirrhosis patients with and without he, are different. linkage of pathogenic colonic mucosal bacteria with poor cognition and inflammation suggests that important processes at the mucosal interface, such as bacterial translocation and immune dysfunction, are involved in the pathogenesis of he. fecal microbiome composition does not change significantly when he is treated with lactulose or when he recurs after lactulose withdrawal. despite improving cognition and endotoxemia as well as shifting positive correlation of pathogenic bacteria with  metabolites, linked to ammonia, aromatic amino acids and oxidative stress, to a negative correlation, rifaximin changes gut microbiome composition only modestly. these observations suggest that the beneficial effects of lactulose and rifaximin could be associated with a change in microbial metabolic function as well as an improvement in dysbiosis.

TI  == essential oils affect populations of some rumen bacteria in vitro as revealed by  microarray (rumenbactarray) analysis.
AB  == in a previous study origanum oil (oro), garlic oil (gao), and peppermint oil (peo) were shown to effectively lower methane production, decrease abundance of methanogens, and change abundances of several bacterial populations important to  feed digestion in vitro. in this study, the impact of these essential oils (eos,  at 0.50 g/l) on the rumen bacterial community composition and population was further examined using the recently developed rumenbactarray. species richness (expressed as number of operational taxonomic units, otus) in the phylum firmicutes, especially those in the class clostridia, was decreased by oro and gao, but increased by peo, while that in the phylum bacteroidetes was increased by oro and peo. species richness in the genus butyrivibrio was lowered by all the eos. increases of bacteroidetes otus mainly resulted from increases of prevotella otus. overall, 67 individual otus showed significant differences (p </= 0.05) in  relative abundance across the eo treatments. the predominant otus affected by eos were diverse, including those related to syntrophococcus sucromutans, succiniclasticum ruminis, and lachnobacterium bovis, and those classified to prevotella, clostridium, roseburia, pseudobutyrivibrio, lachnospiraceae, ruminococcaceae, prevotellaceae, bacteroidales, and clostridiales. in total, 60 otus were found significantly (p </= 0.05) correlated with feed degradability, ammonia concentration, and molar percentage of volatile fatty acids. taken together, this study demonstrated extensive impact of eos on rumen bacterial communities in an eo type-dependent manner, especially those in the predominant families prevotellaceae, lachnospiraceae, and ruminococcaceae. the information from this study may aid in understanding the effect of eos on feed digestion and  fermentation by rumen bacteria.

TI  == high-grain feeding causes strong shifts in ruminal epithelial bacterial community and expression of toll-like receptor genes in goats.
AB  == high-grain (hg) feeding used in intensive goat production can affect the physiology of the rumen wall, but the changes induced in the epimural bacterial community and host toll-like receptors (tlrs) are not well understood. in this study, 10 male goats were randomly allocated to two groups and fed either a hay diet (0% grain; n = 5) or an hg diet (65% grain; n = 5). the changes in the ruminal epithelial bacterial community and expression of tlrs during long-term (7 weeks) hg feeding were determined using pyrosequencing and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. principal coordinate analysis and analysis of molecular variance (amova) results showed that hg feeding caused a strong shift in bacterial composition and structure. at the genus level, our data revealed that it increased the relative abundance of taxa butyrivibrio, unclassified clostridiales, mogibacterium, unclassified anaerolineaceae, and succiniclasticum, and decreased the proportion of unclassified ruminococcaceae, unclassified rikenellaceae, unclassified erysipelotrichaceae, howardella, and unclassified neisseriaceae. the hg-fed goats also exhibited upregulation of the relative mrna  expression of tlr2, tlr3, and tlr5 in the rumen epithelium (p < 0.05). correlation analysis revealed that the increase in tlr expression was associated  with changes in the relative abundance of ruminal epithelial bacteria. this study provides a first insight into the adaptive response of ruminal epithelial bacterial populations to hg feeding in goats and shows that these changes were associated with alterations in tlr expression. these findings provide new insight into understanding of host-microbial relationships in ruminants.

TI  == the gut microbiota of colombians differs from that of americans, europeans and asians.
AB  == background: the composition of the gut microbiota has recently been associated with health and disease, particularly with obesity. some studies suggested a higher proportion of firmicutes and a lower proportion of bacteroidetes in obese  compared to lean people; others found discordant patterns. most studies, however, focused on americans or europeans, giving a limited picture of the gut microbiome. to determine the generality of previous observations and expand our knowledge of the human gut microbiota, it is important to replicate studies in overlooked populations. thus, we describe here, for the first time, the gut microbiota of colombian adults via the pyrosequencing of the 16s ribosomal dna (rdna), comparing it with results obtained in americans, europeans, japanese and  south koreans, and testing the generality of previous observations concerning changes in firmicutes and bacteroidetes with increasing body mass index (bmi). results: we found that the composition of the gut microbiota of colombians was significantly different from that of americans, europeans and asians. the geographic origin of the population explained more variance in the composition of this bacterial community than bmi or gender. concerning changes in firmicutes and bacteroidetes with obesity, in colombians we found a tendency in firmicutes to diminish with increasing bmi, whereas no change was observed in bacteroidetes. a  similar result was found in americans. a more detailed inspection of the colombian dataset revealed that five fiber-degrading bacteria, including akkermansia, dialister, oscillospira, ruminococcaceae and clostridiales, became less abundant in obese subjects. conclusion: we contributed data from unstudied colombians that showed that the geographic origin of the studied population had a greater impact on the composition of the gut microbiota than bmi or gender. any strategy aiming to modulate or control obesity via manipulation of this bacterial community should consider this effect.

TI  == mageeibacillus indolicus gen. nov., sp. nov.: a novel bacterium isolated from the female genital tract.
AB  == three isolates of a bacterium recovered from human endometrium using conventional culture methods were characterized biochemically and subjected to 16s rrna gene sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. isolates were non-motile, obligately anaerobic, non-spore forming, asaccharolytic, non-cellulolytic, indole positive,  gram positive rods. cell wall fatty acid profiling revealed c14:0, c16:0, c18:2 omega6, 9c, c18:1 omega9c and c18:0 to be the major fatty acid composition. the dna mol % g+c was determined to be 44.2%. 16s rrna gene sequence analysis revealed only 91% sequence similarity with the closest cultivated bacterial isolate, saccharofermentans acetigenes. based on genotypic and phenotypic data, all three isolates are considered to be members of the same species and data suggest it represents a novel genus and species in the order clostridiales with an association with clostridium rrna cluster iii within the family ruminococcaceae. we propose the name, mageeibacillus indolicus gen. nov., sp. nov. the type strain is baa-2120(t) and ccug 59143(t).

TI  == two necrotic enteritis predisposing factors, dietary fishmeal and eimeria infection, induce large changes in the caecal microbiota of broiler chickens.
AB  == it is widely established that a high-protein fishmeal supplemented starter diet and eimeria infection can predispose birds to the development of clinical necrotic enteritis symptoms following clostridium perfringens infection. however, it has not been clearly established what changes these treatments cause to predispose birds to succumb to necrotic enteritis. we analysed caecal microbiota  of 4 groups of broilers (n=12) using deep pyrosequencing of 16s rdna amplicons: (1) control chicks fed a control diet, (2) eimeria infected chicks fed control diet, (3) chicks fed fishmeal supplemented diet and lastly (4) both fishmeal fed  and eimeria infected chicks. we found that the high-protein fishmeal diet had a strong effect on the intestinal microbiota similar to the previously reported effect of c. perfringens infection. we noted major changes in the prevalence of various lactobacilli while the total culturable lactobacillus counts remained stable. the ruminococcaceae, lachnospiraceae, unknown clostridiales and lactobacillaceae families were most affected by fishmeal with increases in a number of operational taxonomic units (otus) that had previously been linked to crohn's disease and reductions in otus known to be butyrate producers. eimeria induced very different changes in microbiota; ruminococcaceae groups were reduced in number and three unknown clostridium species were increased in abundance. additionally, eimeria did not significantly influence changes in ph, formic, propionic or isobutyric acid while fishmeal induced dramatic changes in all these measures. both fishmeal feeding and eimeria infection induced significant changes in the gut microbiota; these changes may play an important role in predisposing birds to necrotic enteritis.

TI  == shedding light on the microbial community of the macropod foregut using 454-amplicon pyrosequencing.
AB  == twenty macropods from five locations in queensland, australia, grazing on a variety of native pastures were surveyed and the bacterial community of the foregut was examined using 454-amplicon pyrosequencing. specifically, the v3/v4 region of 16s rrna gene was examined. a total of 5040 otus were identified in the data set (post filtering). thirty-two otus were identified as 'shared' otus (i.e. present in all samples) belonging to either firmicutes or bacteroidetes (clostridiales/bacteroidales). these phyla predominated the general microbial community in all macropods. genera represented within the shared otus included: unclassified ruminococcaceae, unclassified lachnospiraceae, unclassified clostridiales, peptococcus sp. coprococcus spp., streptococcus spp., blautia sp., ruminoccocus sp., eubacterium sp., dorea sp., oscillospira sp. and butyrivibrio sp. the composition of the bacterial community of the foregut samples of each the host species (macropus rufus, macropus giganteus and macropus robustus) was significantly different allowing differentiation between the host species based on alpha and beta diversity measures. specifically, eleven dominant otus that separated the three host species were identified and classified as: unclassified  ruminococcaceae, unclassified bacteroidales, prevotella spp. and a syntrophococcus sucromutans. putative reductive acetogens and fibrolytic bacteria were also identified in samples. future work will investigate the presence and role of fibrolytics and acetogens in these ecosystems. ideally, the isolation and characterization of these organisms will be used for enhanced feed efficiency in  cattle, methane mitigation and potentially for other industries such as the biofuel industry.

TI  == sewage reflects the distribution of human faecal lachnospiraceae.
AB  == faecal pollution contains a rich and diverse community of bacteria derived from animals and humans, many of which might serve as alternatives to the traditional  enterococci and escherichia coli faecal indicators. we used massively parallel sequencing (mps) of the 16s rrna gene to characterize microbial communities from  wastewater treatment plant (wwtp) influent sewage from 12 cities geographically distributed across the usa. we examined members of the clostridiales, which included the families clostridiaceae, lachnospiraceae and ruminococcaceae for their potential as sewage indicators. lachnospiraceae was one of the most abundant groups of faecal bacteria in sewage, and several lachnospiraceae high-abundance sewage pyrotags occurred in at least 46 of 48 human faecal samples. clone libraries targeting clostridium coccoides (c. coccoides) in sewage samples demonstrated that lachnospiraceae-annotated v6 pyrotags encompassed the previously reported c. coccoides group. we used oligotyping to profile the genus  blautia within lachnospiraceae and found oligotypes comprised of 24 entropy components that showed patterns of host specificity. these findings suggest that  indicators based on blautia might have the capacity to discriminate between different faecal pollution sources. development of source-specific alternative indicators would enhance water quality assessments, which leads to improved ecosystem health and reduced human health risk due to waterborne disease.

TI  == high-throughput dna sequence analysis reveals stable engraftment of gut microbiota following transplantation of previously frozen fecal bacteria.
AB  == fecal microbiota transplantation (fmt) is becoming a more widely used technology  for treatment of recurrent clostridum difficile infection (cdi). while previous treatments used fresh fecal slurries as a source of microbiota for fmt, we recently reported the successful use of standardized, partially purified and frozen fecal microbiota to treat cdi. here we report that high-throughput 16s rrna gene sequencing showed stable engraftment of gut microbiota following fmt using frozen fecal bacteria from a healthy donor. similar bacterial taxa were found in post-transplantation samples obtained from the recipients and donor samples, but the relative abundance varied considerably between patients and time points. post fmt samples from patients showed an increase in the abundance of firmicutes and bacteroidetes, representing 75-80% of the total sequence reads. proteobacteria and actinobacteria were less abundant (< 5%) than that found in patients prior to fmt. post fmt samples from two patients were very similar to donor samples, with the bacteroidetes phylum represented by a great abundance of  members of the families bacteroidaceae, rikenellaceae and porphyromonadaceae, and were largely comprised of bacteroides, alistipes and parabacteroides genera. members of the phylum firmicutes were represented by ruminococcaceae, lachnospiraceae, verrucomicrobiaceae and unclassified clostridiales and members of the firmicutes. one patient subsequently received antibiotics for an unrelated infection, resulting in an increase in the number of intestinal proteobacteria, primarily enterobacteriaceae. our results demonstrate that frozen fecal microbiota from a healthy donor can be used to effectively treat recurrent cdi resulting in restoration of the structure of gut microbiota and clearing of clostridum difficile.

TI  == fecal microbial determinants of fecal and systemic estrogens and estrogen metabolites: a cross-sectional study.
AB  == background: high systemic estrogen levels contribute to breast cancer risk for postmenopausal women, whereas low levels contribute to osteoporosis risk. except  for obesity, determinants of non-ovarian systemic estrogen levels are undefined.  we sought to identify members and functions of the intestinal microbial community associated with estrogen levels via enterohepatic recirculation. methods: fifty-one epidemiologists at the national institutes of health, including 25 men, 7 postmenopausal women, and 19 premenopausal women, provided urine and aliquots of feces, using methods proven to yield accurate and reproducible results. estradiol, estrone, 13 estrogen metabolites (em), and their sum (total estrogens) were quantified in urine and feces by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. in feces, beta-glucuronidase and beta-glucosidase activities were determined by realtime kinetics, and microbiome diversity and taxonomy were estimated by pyrosequencing 16s rrna amplicons. pearson correlations were computed for each loge estrogen level, loge enzymatic activity level, and microbiome alpha diversity estimate. for the 55 taxa with mean relative abundance of at least 0.1%, ordinal levels were created [zero, low (below median of detected sequences), high] and compared to loge estrogens, beta-glucuronidase and beta-glucosidase enzymatic activity levels by linear regression. significance was based on two-sided tests with alpha=0.05. results: in men and postmenopausal women, levels of total urinary estrogens (as well as most individual em) were very strongly and directly associated with all measures of fecal microbiome richness and alpha diversity (r>/=0.50, p</=0.003). these non-ovarian systemic estrogens also were strongly and significantly associated with fecal clostridia taxa, including non-clostridiales and three genera in the ruminococcaceae family  (r=0.57-0.70, p=0.03-0.002). estrone, but not other em, in urine correlated significantly with functional activity of fecal beta-glucuronidase (r=0.36, p=0.04). in contrast, fecal beta-glucuronidase correlated inversely with fecal total estrogens, both conjugated and deconjugated (r</=-0.47, p</=0.01). premenopausal female estrogen levels, which were collected across menstrual cycles and thus highly variable, were completely unrelated to fecal microbiome and enzyme parameters (p>/=0.6). conclusions: intestinal microbial richness and functions, including but not limited to beta-glucuronidase, influence levels of non-ovarian estrogens via enterohepatic circulation. thus, the gut microbial community likely affects the risk for estrogen-related conditions in older adults. understanding how clostridia taxa relate to systemic estrogens may identify targets for interventions.

TI  == pyrosequencing of 16s rrna genes in fecal samples reveals high diversity of hindgut microflora in horses and potential links to chronic laminitis.
AB  == background: the nutrition and health of horses is closely tied to their gastrointestinal microflora. gut bacteria break down plant structural carbohydrates and produce volatile fatty acids, which are a major source of energy for horses. bacterial communities are also essential for maintaining gut homeostasis and have been hypothesized to contribute to various diseases including laminitis. we performed pyrosequencing of 16s rrna bacterial genes isolated from fecal material to characterize hindgut bacterial communities in healthy horses and those with chronic laminitis. results: fecal samples were collected from 10 normal horses and 8 horses with chronic laminitis. genomic dna  was extracted and the v4-v5 segment of the 16s rrna gene was pcr amplified and sequenced on the 454 platform generating a mean of 2,425 reads per sample after quality trimming. the bacterial communities were dominated by firmicutes (69.21%  control, 56.72% laminitis) and verrucomicrobia (18.13% control, 27.63% laminitis), followed by bacteroidetes, proteobacteria, and spirochaetes. we observed more otus per individual in the laminitis group than the control group (419.6 and 355.2, respectively, p = 0.019) along with a difference in the abundance of two unassigned clostridiales genera (p = 0.03 and p = 0.01). the most abundant bacteria were streptococcus spp., clostridium spp., and treponema spp.; along with unassigned genera from subdivision 5 of verrucomicrobia, ruminococcaceae, and clostridiaceae, which together constituted ~ 80% of all otus. there was a high level of individual variation across all taxonomic ranks.  conclusions: our exploration of the equine fecal microflora revealed higher bacterial diversity in horses with chronic laminitis and identification of two clostridiales genera that differed in abundance from control horses. there was large individual variation in bacterial communities that was not explained in our study. the core hindgut microflora was dominated by streptococcus spp., several cellulytic genera, and a large proportion of uncharacterized otus that warrant further investigation regarding their function. our data provide a foundation for future investigations of hindgut bacterial factors that may influence the development and progression of chronic laminitis.

TI  == populations of select cultured and uncultured bacteria in the rumen of sheep and  the effect of diets and ruminal fractions.
AB  == the objective of this study was to assess the importance of select cultured and uncultured bacteria in the rumen by quantifying their populations and the effect  of diets and ruminal fractions. full-length 16s rrna gene (rrs) sequences were recovered from rumen samples using specific primers designed from partial sequences recovered previously. five uncultured bacterial operational taxonomic units (otus) were quantified using specific quantitative pcr (qpcr) in fractionated ruminal samples from sheep fed either hay alone or hay plus corn. species fibrobacter succinogenes, ruminococcus albus, r. flavefaciens, ruminobacter amylophilus, selenomonas ruminantium, and mitsuokella multacida and  genera butyrivibrio and prevotella were also quantified as comparison. the full-length rrs sequence improved taxonomic assignments of partial rrs sequences. genus prevotella had the greatest abundance. of the three major cultured cellulolytic species, r. flavefaciens was most abundant, followed by r. albus and f. succinogenes. the five uncultured bacterial otus, classified to genus acetivibrio, genus allobaculum, family ruminococcaceae, order clostridiales, or class clostridia, had abundance comparable to that of the above species of genera except prevotella. corn supplementation and fractions affected distribution of the rumen bacteria, but to a limited extent. when compared to the qpcr data, sequence frequencies in the rrs clone libraries tended to overestimate the abundance of the bacteria represented. this study showed that abundance and population dynamics of uncultured bacteria can be quantified by specific qpcr, which complements the results of rrs clone libraries. this study also revealed that some uncultured bacteria might be as important as some of the well-characterized bacteria in the rumen. the approach used should be applicable  to assess the abundance and potential importance of uncultured bacteria in other  environments.

TI  == identification and characterization of potential performance-related gut microbiotas in broiler chickens across various feeding trials.
AB  == three broiler feeding trials were investigated in order to identify gut bacteria  consistently linked with improvements in bird performance as measured by feed efficiency. trials were done in various geographic locations and varied in diet composition, broiler breed, and bird age. gut microbial communities were investigated using microbial profiling. eight common performance-linked operational taxonomic units (otus) were identified within both the ilea (180, 492, and 564-566) and ceca (140-142, 218-220, 284-286, 312, and 482) across trials. otu 564-566 was associated with lower performance, while otus 140-142, 482, and 492 were associated with improved performance. targeted cloning and sequencing of these eight otus revealed that they represented 26 bacterial species or phylotypes which clustered phylogenetically into seven groups related  to lactobacillus spp., ruminococcaceae, clostridiales, gammaproteobacteria, bacteroidales, clostridiales/lachnospiraceae, and unclassified bacteria/clostridia. where bacteria were identifiable to the phylum level, they belonged predominantly to the firmicutes, with bacteroidetes and proteobacteria also identified. some of the potential performance-related phylotypes showed high sequence identity with classified bacteria (lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus aviarius, lactobacillus crispatus, faecalibacterium prausnitzii, escherichia coli, gallibacterium anatis, clostridium lactatifermentans, ruminococcus torques, bacteroides vulgatus, and alistipes finegoldii). the 16s rrna gene sequence information generated will allow quantitative assays to be developed which will enable elucidations of which of these phylotypes are truly performance related. this information could be used to monitor strategies to improve feed efficiency and feed formulation for optimal gut health.

TI  == influence of antimicrobial feed additives on broiler commensal posthatch gut microbiota development and performance.
AB  == the effects of avilamycin, zinc bacitracin, and flavophospholipol on broiler gut  microbial community colonization and bird performance in the first 17 days posthatch were investigated. significant differences in gut microbiota associated with gut section, dietary treatment, and age were identified by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (t-rflp), although no performance-related differences between dietary treatments were detected. similar age-related shifts in the gut microbiota were identified regardless of diet but varied between the ilea and ceca. interbird variabilities in ileal bacterial communities were reduced (3 to 7 days posthatch) in chicks fed with feed containing antimicrobial agents. avilamycin and flavophospholipol had the most consistent effect on gut microbial communities. operational taxonomic units (otu) linked to changes in gut microbiota in birds on antimicrobial-supplemented diets  were characterized and identified. some otus could be identified to the species level; however, the majority could be only tentatively classified to the genus, family, order, or domain level. otus 140 to 146 (lachnospiraceae), otu 186/188 (lactobacillus johnsonii), otu 220 (lachnospiraceae), otus 284 to 288 (unclassified bacterial spp. or ruminococcaceae), otu 296/298 (unclassified bacterium or clostridiales), and otu 480/482 (oxalobacteraceae) were less prevalent in the guts of chicks fed antimicrobial-supplemented diets. otu 178/180 (lactobacillus crispatus), otu 152 (lactobacillus reuteri or unclassified clostridiales), otu 198/200 (subdoligranulum spp.), and otu 490/492 (unclassified bacterium or enterobacteriaceae) were less prevalent in the gut of chicks raised  on the antimicrobial-free diet. the identification of key bacterial species influenced by antimicrobial-supplemented feed immediately posthatch may assist in the formulation of diets that facilitate beneficial gut microbial colonization and, hence, the development of alternatives to current antimicrobial agents in feed for sustainable poultry production.

TI  == as yet uncultured bacteria phylogenetically classified as prevotella, lachnospiraceae incertae sedis and unclassified bacteroidales, clostridiales and  ruminococcaceae may play a predominant role in ruminal biohydrogenation.
AB  == microbial biohydrogenation of dietary poly-unsaturated fatty acids (pufa) to saturated fatty acids (sfa) in the rumen results in the high ratio of sfa/pufa in ruminant products, such as meat and milk. in vitro, butyrivibrio proteoclasticus-related bacteria extensively biohydrogenate pufa to sfa, yet their contribution in the rumen has not been confirmed. the aim of this study was to evaluate the role of butyrivibrio proteoclasticus group bacteria in ruminal biohydrogenation and to assess the possible role of other bacteria. fish oil at 0%, 1.5% and 3% dry matter intake was fed to eight holstein x friesian steers, in order to elicit changes in the extent of pufa biohydrogenation. fatty acid and b. proteoclasticus group 16s rrna concentrations in rumen digesta were determined. correlation between digesta 18:0 concentration and b. proteoclasticus group 16s rrna concentration was low. terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) coupled with multivariate statistics revealed that many terminal restriction fragments (t-rfs) and dgge bands were linked to cis-9, trans-11 conjugated linoleic acid (cla), 18:1 trans-11 and 18:0 ruminal concentrations. mica t-rf predictive identification software showed that these linked t-rfs were likely to originate from as yet uncultured bacteria classified as prevotella, lachnospiraceae incertae sedis, and unclassified bacteroidales, clostridiales and ruminococcaceae. sequencing of linked dgge bands also revealed that as yet uncultured bacteria classified as prevotella, anaerovoax (member of the lachnospiraceae incertae sedis family), and unclassified clostridiales and ruminococcaceae may play a role in biohydrogenation.

TI  == phylogenetic analysis of 16s rrna gene sequences reveals distal gut bacterial diversity in wild wolves (canis lupus).
AB  == the aim of this study was to describe the microbial communities in the distal gut of wild wolves (canis lupus). fecal samples were collected from three healthy unrelated adult wolves captured at the nearby of dalai lake nature reserve in inner mongolia of china. the diversity of fecal bacteria was investigated by constructing pcr-amplified 16s rrna gene clone libraries using the universal bacterial primers 27 f and 1493 r. a total of 307 non-chimeric near-full-length 16s rrna gene sequences were analyzed and 65 non-redundant bacteria phylotypes (operational taxonomical units, otus) were identified. seventeen otus (26%) showed less than 98% sequence similarity to 16s rrna gene sequences were reported previously. five different bacterial phyla were identified, with the majority of  otus being classified within the phylum firmicutes (60%), followed by bacteroidetes (16.9%), proteobacteria (9.2%), fusobacteria (9.2%) and actinobacteria (4.6%). the majority of clones fell within the order clostridiales (53.8% of otus). it was predominantly affiliated with five families: lachnospiraceae was the most diverse bacterial family in this order, followed by  ruminococcaceae, clostridiaceae, peptococcaceae and peptostreptococcaceae.
