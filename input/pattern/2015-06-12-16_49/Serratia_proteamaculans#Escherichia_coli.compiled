TI  - Serendipitous crystallization and structure determination of cyanase (CynS) from  Serratia proteamaculans.
AB  - Cyanate hydratase (CynS) catalyzes the decomposition of cyanate and bicarbonate into ammonia and carbon dioxide. Here, the serendipitous crystallization of CynS from Serratia proteamaculans (SpCynS) is reported. SpCynS was crystallized as an impurity and its identity was determined using mass-spectrometric analysis. The crystals belonged to space group P1 and diffracted to 2.1 A resolution. The overall structure of SpCynS is very similar to a previously determined structure of CynS from Escherichia coli. Density for a ligand bound to the SpCynS active site was observed, but could not be unambiguously identified. Additionally, glycerol molecules bound at the entry to the active site of the enzyme indicate conserved residues that might be important for the trafficking of substrates and products.
TI  - Virulence factors contributing to invasive activities of Serratia grimesii and Serratia proteamaculans.
AB  - Previously, we have shown that facultative pathogens Serratia grimesii and Serratia proteamaculans are capable to invade eukaryotic cells provided that they synthesize intracellular metalloprotease grimelysin or protealysin, respectively (Bozhokina et al. in Cell Biol Int 35(2):111-118, 2011). Noninvasive Escherichia coli transformed with grimelysin or protealysin gene became invasive, indicating that the protease is a virulence factor. Here we elucidated involvement of other virulence factors in the invasion of S. grimesii and S. proteamaculans. Under similar experimental conditions, the amount of S. proteamaculans internalized within human carcinoma HeLa cells was fivefold higher than that of S. grimesii. In accord with this, in S. proteamaculans, high activities of pore-forming hemolysin ShlA and extracellular metalloprotease serralysin were detected. In S. grimesii, activity of toxin ShlA was not detected, and the serralysin activity of the bacterial growth medium was very low. We also show that iron depletion strongly enhanced invasive activity of S. proteamaculans, increasing activities of hemolysin ShlA and serralysin, but did not affect S. grimesii properties. These results show that the invasive activity of S. proteamaculans is maintained, along with protealysin, by hemolysin and serralysin. On the other hand, grimelysin is so far the only known invasion factor of S. grimesii.
TI  - The role of the chi1 gene from the endophytic bacteria Serratia proteamaculans 336x in the biological control of wheat take-all.
AB  - Take-all, a disease caused by the fungus Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici, is the most important root disease of wheat and causes severe yield losses worldwide. Using microorganisms as biological agents to control the disease is important because no resistant cultivars or effective chemical fungicides are available. In this study, we tested the biological control capability of a chitinase produced by the endophytic bacterium Serratia proteamaculans 336x against wheat take-all. The chitinase gene chi1 of S. proteamaculans 336x was cloned and heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli. The recombinant protein exhibited chitinase activity and in vitro antifungal activity against G. graminis var. tritici. With in-frame deletion of the chi1 gene by homologous recombination, the chi1-deleted mutant was devoid of chitinase activity and the biocontrol efficacy was reduced by 42.5%. The complementation of the Deltachi1 mutant strain by the chi1 gene resulted in the partial restoration of the chitinase activity and biocontrol efficacy. These results support a role for the Chi1 protein in the biocontrol process of S. proteamaculans 336x against wheat take-all.
TI  - Discovery of a bifunctional acyltransferase responsible for ornithine lipid synthesis in Serratia proteamaculans.
AB  - Ornithine lipids (OLs) are phosphorus-free membrane lipids that can be formed by  many bacteria but that are absent from archaea and eukaryotes. A function for OLs in stress conditions and in host-bacteria interactions has been shown in some bacteria. Some bacterial species have been described that can form OLs, but lack the known genes (olsBA) involved in its biosynthesis, which implied the existence of a second pathway. Here we describe the bifunctional protein OlsF from Serratia proteamaculans involved in OL formation. Expression of OlsF and its homologue from Flavobacterium johnsoniae in Escherichia coli causes OL formation. Deletion of OlsF in S. proteamaculans caused the absence of OL formation. Homologues of OlsF are widely distributed among gamma-, delta- and epsilon-Proteobacteria and in the Cytophaga-Flavobacterium-Bacteroidetes group of bacteria, including several well-studied pathogens for which the presence of OLs has not been suspected, such as for example Vibrio cholerae and Klebsiella pneumonia. Using genomic data, we predict that about 50% of bacterial species can form OLs.
TI  - Cloning, sequencing, expression, and characterization of thermostability of oligopeptidase B from Serratia proteamaculans, a novel psychrophilic protease.
AB  - Protease from Serratia proteamaculans (PSP) is the first known psychrophilic oligopeptidase B. The gene of S. proteamaculans 94 oligopeptidase B was cloned, sequenced and expressed in Escherichia coli. The unfolding of PSP molecule following heat treatment at 37 degrees C by measuring fluorescence spectra was examined in parallel with the residual activity determination. The effect of PSP thermostabilization by glycerol at 37-50 degrees capital ES, Cyrillic was revealed. Calcium ions and buffer solution of low molarity cause the opposite effect - the acceleration of PSP inactivation at 37 degrees C. The thermal stability of PSP molecule in the presence of 0-100mM CaCl2 was also investigated by means of high-sensitivity differential scanning calorimetry. The artificial reconstruction of the natural complex PSP-chaperonin from S. small er, Cyrillicroteamaculans was carried out: the stable complex (1:1) of chaperonin E. small es, Cyrillicoli GroEL with active recombinant enzyme PSP was obtained. It was shown that complex formation with chaperonin promotes PSP thermostability at 37 degrees C.
TI  - Andrimid production at low temperature by a psychrotolerant Serratia proteamaculans strain.
AB  - Andrimid, a known non-ribosomal pseudo-peptide antibiotic, was isolated from a psychrotolerant Serratia proteamaculans strain. The antibiotic peptide was produced at low temperature (8 degrees C) in a 7.5 l BIOFLO 101 bioreactor under batch culture mode. Andrimid activity from S. proteamaculans culture was only detected at 25 degrees C and below and potent antibacterial activity was revealed against both, pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacteria. Minimal inhibitory concentration values determined by microdilution experiments varied in the range between 0.01 and 0.78 mug/ml. Antimicrobial purification and structure elucidation were carried out by LC-MS/MS and (1)H/(1)(3)C NMR approaches. The effects on the ultrastructure of sensitive Escherichia coli 35,218 cells were observed by transmission electron microscopy at different inhibition stages. This work demonstrated the significance of bioprospection from cold environments through the screening of microorganisms with ability to produce cold-active biomolecules of biotechnological interest. S. proteamaculans 136 was revealed as a novel microbial source for andrimid production at low temperatures, showing biotechnological potential to be applied in cryopreservation, food or cosmetic industries against pathogenic bacteria.
TI  - Antibacterial effects of silver nanoparticles on gram-negative bacteria: influence on the growth and biofilms formation, mechanisms of action.
AB  - Antibacterial action of silver nanoparticles (AgNP) on Gram-negative bacteria (planctonic cells and biofilms) is reported in this study. AgNP of 8.3 nm in diameter stabilized by hydrolyzed casein peptides strongly inhibited biofilms formation of Escherichia coli AB1157, Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 and Serratia proteamaculans 94 in concentrations of 4-5 mug/ml, 10 mug/ml and 10-20 mug/ml, respectively. The viability of E. coli AB1157 cells in biofilms was considerably reduced by AgNP concentrations above 100 to -150 mug/ml. E. coli strains with mutations in genes responsible for the repair of DNA containing oxidative lesions (mutY, mutS, mutM, mutT, nth) were less resistant to AgNP than wild type strains. This suggests that these genes may be involved in the repair of DNA damage caused by AgNP. E. coli mutants deficient in excision repair, SOS-response and in the synthesis of global regulators RpoS, CRP protein and Lon protease present similar resistance to AgNP as wild type cells. LuxI/LuxR Quorum Sensing systems did not participate in the control of sensitivity to AgNP of Pseudomonas and Serratia. E. coli mutant strains deficient in OmpF or OmpC porins were 4-8 times more resistant to AgNP as compared to the wild type strain. This suggests that porins have an important function related AgNP antibacterial effects.
TI  - Multiple chitinases of an endophytic Serratia proteamaculans 568 generate chitin  oligomers.
AB  - Serratia proteamaculans 568 genome revealed the presence of four family 18 chitinases (Sp ChiA, Sp ChiB, Sp ChiC, and Sp ChiD). Heterologous expression and characterization of Sp ChiA, Sp ChiB, and Sp ChiC showed that these enzymes were optimally active at pH 6.0-7.0, and 40 degrees C. The three Sp chitinases displayed highest activity/binding to beta-chitin and showed broad range of substrate specificities, and released dimer as major end product from oligomeric and polymeric substrates. Longer incubation was required for hydrolysis of trimer for the three Sp chitinases. The three Sp chitinases released up to tetramers from colloidal chitin substrate. Sp ChiA and Sp ChiB were processive chitinases, while Sp ChiC was a non-processive chitinase. Based on the known structures of ChiA and ChiB from S. marcescens, 3D models of Sp ChiA and Sp ChiB were generated.
TI  - Filamentous actin is a substrate for protealysin, a metalloprotease of invasive Serratia proteamaculans.
AB  - Homologous bacterial metalloproteases ECP32/grimelysin from Serratia grimesii and protealysin from Serratia proteamaculans are involved in the invasion of the nonpathogenic bacteria in eukaryotic cells and are suggested to translocate into the cytoplasm [Bozhokina ES et al. (2011) Cell Biol Int35, 111-118]. The proteases have been characterized as actin-hydrolyzing enzymes with a narrow specificity toward intact cell proteins. However, cleavage of filamentous actin (F-actin) (i.e. the main actin species in the cell) and the properties of the cleaved F-actin have not been investigated previously. In the present study, we revealed the presence of protealysin in the cytoplasm of 3T3-SV40 cells infected with S. proteamaculans or recombinant Escherichia coli expressing the protealysin gene. We also show for the first time that purified protealysin and the lysates of the recombinant E. coli producing protealysin cleave 20-40% of F-actin. Cleavage limited predominantly to the bond Gly42-Val43 efficiently increases the steady-state ATPase activity (dynamics) of F-actin. abolishes this effect and promotes the nucleation of protealysin-cleaved Mg-globular-actin even in the absence of 0.1 m KCl, most likely as a result of the stabilization of lateral intermonomer contacts of actin subunits. The results obtained in the present study suggest that F-actin can be a target for protealysin upon its translocation into the host cell.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence of the Serratia entomophila plasmid pADAP and the Serratia proteamaculans pU143 plasmid virulence associated region.
AB  - Some strains of Serratia entomophila and S. proteamaculans cause amber disease of the New Zealand grass grub Costelytra zealandica (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae), an important pasture pest in New Zealand. The disease determinants of S. entomophila, are encoded on a 153,404-bp plasmid, termed pADAP for amber disease associated plasmid. The S. proteamaculans strain 143 (Sp143) exhibits an unusual pathotype, where only 60-70% of C. zealandica larvae infected with the bacterium succumb to disease. DNA sequence analysis of the Sp143 pU143 virulence associated region identified high DNA similarity to the pADAP sep virulence associated region, with DNA sequence variation in the sepA gene and the variable region of the sepC component. No pADAP anti-feeding prophage orthologue was detected in the Sp143 genome. The region of pADAP replication was cloned and found to replicate in S. entomophila but not in Escherichia coli. DNA sequence analysis of the plasmid pSG348 repA gene from the French isolate of Serratia grimesii, identified 93% DNA identity to the pADAP repA gene. A comparison of the pU143 virulence associated region with the completed pADAP nucleotide sequence is given.
TI  - Bacterial invasion of eukaryotic cells can be mediated by actin-hydrolysing metalloproteases grimelysin and protealysin.
AB  - Earlier, we have shown that spontaneously isolated non-pathogenic bacteria Serratia grimesii and Serratia proteamaculans invade eukaryotic cells, provided that they synthesize thermolysin-like metalloproteases ECP32/grimelysin or protealysin characterized by high specificity towards actin. To address the question of whether the proteases are active players in entry of these bacteria into host cells, in this work, human larynx carcinoma Hep-2 cells were infected with recombinant Escherichia coli expressing grimelysin or protealysin. Using confocal and electron microscopy, we have found that the recombinant bacteria, whose extracts limitedly cleaved actin, were internalized within the eukaryotic cells residing both in vacuoles and free in cytoplasm. The E. coli-carrying plasmids without inserts of grimelysin or protealysin gene did not enter Hep-2 cells. Moreover, internalization of non-invasive E. coli was not observed in the presence of protealysin introduced into the culture medium. These results are consistent with the direct participation of ECP32/grimelysin and protealysin in entry of bacteria into the host cells. We assume that ECP32/grimelysin and protealysin mediate invasion being injected into the eukaryotic cell and that the high specificity of the enzyme towards actin may be a factor contributed to the bacteria internalization.
TI  - [Antibacterial effects of silver ions: effect on gram-negative bacteria growth and biofilm formation].
AB  - Minimal inhibiting AgNO3 concentration (MICs) in the gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli K12, Serratia proteamaculans 94, and Serratia liquefaciens MG1 were found to be on the average within the range of 0.075-0.3 microg/ml, and for Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 and P. chlororaphis 449, 0.15-0.3 microg/ml. Biofilm formation in Escherichia coli AB1157 and S. Proteamaculans 94 was completely inhibited at an AgNO3 concentration of 0.3 microg/ml, and in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1, at 0.6 microg/mlAgNO3. Mutations in E. coli genes encoding for global regulators of gene expression, such as sigma S and sigma N subunits of RNA polymerase, catabolite repression protein CRP, and Lon protease, had no marked effect on the sensitivity of cells to silver. The wild-type E. coli strains and strains deficient in excision repair (uvrA, uvrB), SOS-repair or recombination (recA, lexA, recBC, recF mutants) did not differ in their silver sensitivity. This suggests that the sensitivity of bacteria to silver does not correlate with DNA lesions that could be repaired by these repair and recombination systems. E. coli mutant strains deficient in porins OmpF or OmpC, were 3-4-fold more resistant to silver ions as compared with the wild-type strain. Experiments with pME6863 plasmid harboring the gene of N-acyl-homoserine lactonase AiiA demonstrated that Quorum Sensing regulation (QS) did not participate in the control of S. proteamaculans 94 and P. chlororaphis 449 silver sensitivity. The same conclusion was drawn from the comparison of AgNO3 MICs for the S. liquefaciens wild-type strain and a mutant strain deficient in QS.
TI  - Oligopeptidase B from Serratia proteamaculans. I. Determination of primary structure, isolation, and purification of wild-type and recombinant enzyme variants.
AB  - A novel trypsin-like protease (PSP) from the psychrotolerant gram-negative microorganism Serratia proteamaculans was purified by ion-exchange chromatography on Q-Sepharose and affinity chromatography on immobilized basic pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI-Sepharose). PSP formed a tight complex with GroEL chaperonin. A method for dissociating the GroEL-PSP complex was developed. Electrophoretically homogeneous PSP had molecular mass of 78 kDa; the N-terminal amino acid sequence 1-10 was determined, and mass-spectral analysis of PSP tryptic peptides was carried out. The enzyme was found to be the previously unknown oligopeptidase B (OpdB). The S. proteamaculans 94 OpdB gene was sequenced and the producer strain Escherichia coli BL-21(DE3) pOpdB No. 22 was constructed. The yield of expressed His(6)-PSP was 1.5 mg/g biomass.
TI  - Probing for actinase activity of protealysin.
AB  - The ability of protealysin, a thermolysin-like metallopeptidase from Serratia proteamaculans 94, to cleave actin and matrix metalloprotease MMP2 is reported. In globular actin, protealysin and S. proteamaculans 94 cell extracts are shown to hydrolyze the Gly42-Val43 peptide bond within the DNase-binding loop and the Gly63-Ile64 and Thr66-Ile67 peptide bonds within the nucleotide cleft of the molecule. At enzyme/substrate mass ratio of 1 : 50 and below, a 36 kDa-fragment produced by the cleavage between Gly42 and Val43 was virtually resistant to further breakdown. Judging from the results of zymography, protealysin transforms proMMP2 into a 66 kDa polypeptide characteristic of mature MMP2, indicating that protealysin can activate MMP2. Upon incubation of S. proteamaculans 94 with human larynx carcinoma Hep-2 cells intracellular bacteria were detected in about 10% of Hep-2 cells, this being the first evidence for invasion of eukaryotic cells with bacteria of this species. Thus, S. proteamaculans 94 turned out to be one more bacterial strain in which synthesis of actin-specific metalloprotease is coupled with bacterial invasion. These results are consistent with the idea of the actinase activity of bacterial metalloproteases being a factor that may promote bacterial invasion of eukaryotic cells.
TI  - Gene cloning, expression, and characterization of a new carboxylesterase from Serratia sp. SES-01: comparison with Escherichia coli BioHe enzyme.
AB  - The carboxylesterase-encoding gene (bioHs) of a newly isolated strain, Serratia sp. SES-01, was cloned from the genomic DNA library by detecting formation of transparent halo around the colony on LB-tributyrin agar plates. The amino acid sequence of BioHs was highly similar to the members of the BioH enzyme family involved in the biotin biosynthetic pathway; it showed the highest similarity (91%) with that of Serratia proteamaculans. To compare BioHs with other BioH enzymes, the relatively well-known bioHe gene of E. coli was cloned with PCR. After we achieved high-level expression of soluble BioHs and BioHe through the exploration of different culture conditions, the purified BioHs and BioHe enzymes were characterized in terms of specificity, activity, and stability. BioHe was generally more robust to a change in temperature and pH and an addition of organic solvents than BioHs. The two enzymes exhibited a strong preference for carboxylesterase rather than for thioesterase and were optimal at relatively low temperatures (20-40 degrees ) and alkaline pHs (7.5-9.0). The results in this study strongly suggested that both the BioHs and BioHe enzymes would be potential candidates for use as a carboxylesterase in many industrial applications.
TI  - Escherichia coli can produce recombinant chitinase in the soil to control the pathogenesis by Fusarium oxysporum without colonization.
AB  - Fusarium wilt of cucumbers was effectively controlled by Escherichia coli expressing an endochitinase gene (chiA), and the rate was as effective (60.0%) as the wildtype strain S. proteamaculans 3095 (55.0%) where the gene was cloned. However, live cells of soil inoculated E. coli host harboring the chiA gene did not proliferate but declined 100-fold from 108 CFU during the first week and showed less than 10 cells after day 14, suggesting that E. coli was able to express and produce the chitinase enzyme to the soil even as the population was gradually decreasing. Because the majority of the strains was alive for only a short period of time and the Fusarium-affected seedlings showed symptoms of wilting within 7-10 days, it seems that the pathogen control was decided early after the introduction of the biocontrol agent, eliminating the survival of the antagonist. These results indicated that soil inoculated E. coli could sufficiently express and produce the recombinant protein to control the pathogen, and root or soil colonization of the antagonist might not be a significant factor in determining the efficacy of biological control.
TI  - Induced expression of the Serratia entomophila Sep proteins shows activity towards the larvae of the New Zealand grass grub Costelytra zealandica.
AB  - Serratia entomophila and Serratia proteamaculans cause amber disease of the grass grub Costelytra zealandica (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae). Three genes required for virulence, sepABC, are located on a large plasmid, pADAP. The translated products of the sep genes are members of the toxin complex (Tc) family of insecticidal toxins that reside in the genomes of some Enterobacteriaceae. Each of the sep genes was placed either singly or as various combinations under the control of an inducible arabinose promoter, allowing their inductive expression. Western Immunoblot confirmed that each of the Sep proteins migrated at their predicted size on sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel. Bioassays of sonicated filtrates derived from the various arabinose-induced para-SEP constructs showed that only when sepA, sepB and sepC were coexpressed were amber disease symptoms observed in grass grub larvae. Fourteen days after ingestion of the Sep protein filtrate, approximately 64% of the larvae reverted from a diseased to a healthy phenotype. Redosing the revertents with a fresh Sep protein filtrate reinitiated the amber pathotype, indicating that the Sep proteins are needed to be continuously present to exert an effect.
TI  - Biotransformation of adenine and cytokinins by the rhizobacterium Serratia proteamaculans.
AB  - Approximately 60,000 microorganisms from Saskatchewan soil were screened for growth on the cytokinin N6-benzyladenine (BA) as C source. A single isolate, identified as Serratia proteamaculans, grew well on BA. The culture filtrates from S. proteamaculans were screened using reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) for the presence of secondary metabolites. The analysis revealed a major metabolite and its chemical structure was deduced as 8-hydroxy-N6-benzyladenine (8-OHBA). Subsequently, the S. proteamaculans isolate was also found to metabolize N6-(2-isopentenyl)adenine and adenine through oxidation of C-8 of the purine ring. A clone of the S. proteamaculans xanthine dehydrogenase (Xdh, EC 1.1.1.204) encoding genes was isolated in Escherichia coli. This E. coli isolate metabolized BA to 8-OHBA. Similar to other bacterial Xdh, the S. proteamaculans enzyme was composed of two subunits. The derived amino acid sequences of these Xdh subunits were most similar (XdhA, 60%; XdhB, 72%) to those of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Cloning, sequencing, expression, and characterization of protealysin, a novel neutral proteinase from Serratia proteamaculans representing a new group of thermolysin-like proteases with short N-terminal region of precursor.
AB  - The gene of Serratia proteamaculans proteinase, protealysin, was cloned, sequenced, and expressed in Escherichia coli. The gene encoded a precursor of 341 amino acids (AAs) with a significant homology to thermolysin-like proteinases (TLPs). The molecular weight of the purified mature active recombinant protein was 32 kDa, the N-terminal amino acid sequence was AKTSTGGEVI. The optimum pH for azocasein hydrolysis by protealysin was seven and it was completely inhibited by o-phenanthroline. The enzyme hydrolyzed 3-(2-furyl)acryloyl-glycyl-L-leucine amide, the standard substrate for TLPs, with k(cat)/K(m) ratio of (2.52 +/- 0.02) x 10(2) M(-1) s(-1). Protealysin maturation removes 50 AA from the N-terminus of the precursor. The removed region had no similarity with the preprosequence of thermolysin (232 AA) but was homologous to some other TLPs. These proteins shared a conserved 7-AA motif near the initial methionine. Such motif was also found in some nonproteolytic putative proteins; two of them were eukaryotic.
TI  - Cloning Serratia entomophila antifeeding genes--a putative defective prophage active against the grass grub Costelytra zealandica.
AB  - Serratia entomophila and Serratia proteamaculans (Enterobacteriaceae) cause amber disease in the grass grub Costelytra zealandica (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae), an important pasture pest in New Zealand. Larval disease symptoms include cessation of feeding, clearance of the gut, amber coloration, and eventual death. A 155-kb plasmid, pADAP, carries the genes sepA, sepB, and sepC, which are essential for production of amber disease symptoms. Transposon insertions in any of the sep genes in pADAP abolish gut clearance but not cessation of feeding, indicating the presence of an antifeeding gene(s) elsewhere on pADAP. Based on deletion analysis of pADAP and subsequent sequence data, a 47-kb clone was constructed, which when placed in either an Escherichia coli or a Serratia background exerted strong antifeeding activity and often led to rapid death of the infected grass grub larvae. Sequence data show that the antifeeding component is part of a large gene cluster that may form a defective prophage and that six potential members of this prophage are present in Photorhabdus luminescens subsp. laumondii TTO1, a species which also has sep gene homologues.
TI  - Peripheral sequences of the Serratia entomophila pADAP virulence-associated region.
AB  - Some strains of the Enterobacteriaceae Serratia entomophila and Serratia proteamaculans cause amber disease in the grass grub, Costelytra zealandica (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae), an important pasture pest in New Zealand. The genes responsible for this disease reside on a large, 155-kb plasmid designated amber disease-associated plasmid (pADAP). Herein, we report the DNA sequencing of approximately 50 kb upstream and 10 kb downstream of the virulence-encoding region. Based on similarity with proteins in the current databases, and potential ribosome-binding sites, 63 potential ORFs were determined. Eleven of these ORFs belong to a type IV pilus cluster (pilL-V) and a further eight have similarities to the translated products of the plasmid transfer traH-N genes of the plasmid R64. In addition, a degenerate 785-nt direct repeat flanks a 44.7-kb region with the potential to encode three Bacillus subtilis Yee-type proteins, a fimbrial gene cluster, the sep virulence-associated genes and several remnant IS elements.
TI  - Methods for detecting acylated homoserine lactones produced by Gram-negative bacteria and their application in studies of AHL-production kinetics.
AB  - In the process of evaluating the role of acylated homoserine lactones (AHLs) in food-spoiling Gram-negative bacteria, we have combined a range of bacterial AHL monitor systems to determine the AHL-profile and the kinetics of AHL-production. AHL production from 148 strains of Enterobacteriaceae isolated from foods was tested using Escherichia coli pSB403 (LuxR), Agrobacterium tumefaciens A136 (TraR) and both induction and inhibition of Chromobacterium violaceum CV026 (CviR). All strains except one was found to produce AHL(s). In no case could a single monitor system identify more than 64% of the Enterobacteriaceae as AHL-producers, showing that the simultaneous use of monitor strains is required in the process of screening bacterial populations for AHL-production. AHLs from 20 selected strains were profiled by thin layer chromatography. Most strains produced more than one AHL with 3-N-oxo-hexanoyl homoserine lactone being the most prominent. It was found that the simultaneous use of monitor strains in the top-layer was necessary for the detection of (presumably) all the AHLs. An agar well-diffusion assay based on A. tumefaciens pDZLR4 was used for quantifying AHLs from bacterial supernatants and enabled an assessment of the kinetics of AHL-production of 3 strains (Serratia proteamaculans strain B5a, Erwinia carotovora ATCC 39048 and V. fischeri strain MJ-1). As expected, the production of AHL (OHHL) and luminescence in Vibrio fischeri strain MJ-1 increased faster than growth indicating up-regulation of the AHL regulated phenotype and auto-induction of AHL production. In contrast, production kinetics of AHL (OHHL) in the two Enterobacteriaceae indicated lack of auto-induction.
TI  - Plasmid-located pathogenicity determinants of Serratia entomophila, the causal agent of amber disease of grass grub, show similarity to the insecticidal toxins of Photorhabdus luminescens.
AB  - Serratia entomophila and Serratia proteamaculans cause amber disease in the grass grub Costelytra zealandica (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae), an important pasture pest in New Zealand. Larval disease symptoms include cessation of feeding, clearance of the gut, amber coloration, and eventual death. A 115-kb plasmid, pADAP, identified in S. entomophila is required for disease causation and, when introduced into Escherichia coli, enables that organism to cause amber disease. A 23-kb fragment of pADAP that conferred disease-causing ability on E. coli and a pADAP-cured strain of S. entomophila was isolated. Using insertion mutagenesis, the pathogenicity determinants were mapped to a 17-kb region of the clone. Sequence analysis of the 17-kb region showed that the predicted products of three of the open reading frames (sepA, sepB, and sepC) showed significant sequence similarity to components of the insecticidal toxin produced by the bacterium Photorhabdus luminescens. Transposon insertions in sepA, sepB, or sepC completely abolished both gut clearance and cessation of feeding on the 23-kb clone; when recombined back into pADAP, they abolished gut clearance but not cessation of feeding. These results suggest that SepA, SepB, and SepC together are sufficient for amber disease causation by S. entomophila and that another locus also able to exert a cessation-of-feeding effect is encoded elsewhere on pADAP.
TI  - Hemolysin as a marker for Serratia.
AB  - All Serratia marcescens strains (total of 33) of different sources were hemolytic including clinical strains previously classified as being nonhemolytic. DNA fragments of the two hemolysin genes hybridized with the chromosomal DNA of S. marcescens, S. liquefaciens, S. kiliensis, S. grimesii, S. proteamaculans, S. plymutica, S. rubridaea which were also hemolytic. The restriction pattern of the hemolysin locus differed in each strain. S. ficaria and S. marinorubra expressed a different hemolysin which was much smaller than the S. marcescens hemolysin since it diffused through dialysis membranes. The DNA of the latter strains did not hybridize with the S. marcescens hemolysin DNA probes. Some S. marcescens strains, S. kiliensis and S. liquefaciens also expressed in addition the small hemolysin. No hybridization was found with DNA of Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella arerogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Shigella dysenteriae, Yersinia enterocolitica, Yersinia pseudotuberculosus, Listeria sp., Aeromonas sp., Legionella sp. and a Meninococcus sp., indicating that the hemolysin DNA probes are specific for Serratia, or that the hemolysin genes occur rarely in genera other than Serratia.
