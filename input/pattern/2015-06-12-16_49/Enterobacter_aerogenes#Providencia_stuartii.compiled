TI  - Molecular epidemiology of KPC-2-producing Enterobacteriaceae (non-Klebsiella pneumoniae) isolated from Brazil.
AB  - In Brazil, since 2009, there has been an ever increasing widespread of the blaKPC-2 gene, mainly in Klebsiella pneumoniae. This study aims to assess the molecular epidemiology and genetic background of this gene in Enterobacteriaceae (non-K. pneumoniae) species from 9 Brazilian states between 2009 and 2011. Three hundred eighty-seven isolates were analyzed exhibiting nonsusceptibility to carbapenems, in which the blaKPC-2 gene was detected in 21.4%. By disk diffusion and E-test, these isolates exhibited high rates of resistance to most of the antimicrobials tested, including tigecycline (45.6% nonsusceptible) and polymyxin B (16.5%), the most resistant species being Enterobacter aerogenes and Enterobacter cloacae. We found great clonal diversity and a variety of blaKPC-2-carrying plasmids, all of them exhibiting a partial Tn4401 structure. Therefore, this study demonstrates the dissemination of KPC-2 in 9 Enterobacteriaceae species, including species that were not previously described such as Pantoea agglomerans and Providencia stuartii.
TI  - Infection due to colistin-resistant Enterobacteriacae in critically-ill patients.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: This study was conducted in response to the rising incidence of drug resistance observed in the intensive care unit (ICU) of King Fahad Medical City. METHODOLOGY: A retrospective observational study was conducted in the ICU of King Fahad Medical City between October 2003 and April 2012. Data were collected using a structured data sheet. RESULTS: Nine episodes of infection with colistin-resistant Enterobacteriacae were recorded in seven patients. Five were females with an average age of 59.75 years. All patients had multiple co-morbidities; five had diabetes mellitus. In five of the episodes, Klebsiella pneumoniae was responsible, Serratia marcescens was reported in two, while Enterobacter aerogenes and Providencia stuartii were responsible for one episode of infection each. Prior colistin use was documented in all but one patient. Colistin resistance was defined by a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of > 4 microg/mL according to the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) clinical breakpoint for Enterobacteriacae. Various antibiotics were used to treat the patients, with mortality reported in two. CONCLUSION: Infection due to colistin-resistant Enterobacteriacae is a rising challenge in Saudi Arabia; colistin use is thought to be associated with these infections. This calls for a stricter antimicrobial stewardship program and improved infection control measures to curb the rising trend of antibiotic resistance.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Schinus lentiscifolius (Anacardiaceae).
AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Schinus lentiscifolius Marchand (syn. Schinus weinmannifolius Engl) is a plant native to Rio Grande do Sul (Southern Brazil) and has been used in Brazilian traditional medicine as antiseptic and antimicrobial for the treatment of many different health problems as well as to treat leucorrhea and to assist in ulcer and wound healing. Although it is a plant widely used by the population, there are no studies proving this popular use. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The crude aqueous extract, the crude neutral methanol extract, fractions prepared from this extract (n-hexane, ethyl acetate, and n-butanol), pure compounds isolated from these fractions, and derivatives were investigated in vitro for antimicrobial activities against five Gram positive bacteria: Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Streptococcus pyogenes, three Gram negative bacteria: Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Shigella sonnei, and four yeasts: Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The isolated compound moronic acid, which is the most active, was tested against a range of other bacteria such as two Gram positive bacteria, namely, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus spp, and six Gram negative bacteria, namely, Burkholderia cepacia, Providencia stuartii, Morganella morganii, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Proteus mirabilis. RESULTS: The leaf aqueous extract (decoction) of Schinus lentiscifolius showed a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, ranging from 125 to 250 mug/ml (MIC) against the tested bacteria and fungi. The n-hexane extract, despite being very little active against bacteria, showed an excellent antifungal activity, especially against Candida albicans (MIC=25 mug/ml), Candida tropicalis (MIC=15.5 mug/ml), and Cryptococcus neoformans, (MIC=15.5 mug/ml). From the acetate fraction (the most active against bacteria), compounds 1-6 were isolated: nonadecanol (1), moronic acid (2), gallic acid methyl ester (3), gallic acid (4), quercetin (5) and quercitrin (6). The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of moronic acid between 1.5 and 3 mug/ml against most of the tested bacteria shows that it is one of the metabolites responsible for the antibacterial activity of Schinus lentiscifolius. CONCLUSION: The antimicrobial activity and some constituents of Schinus lentiscifolius are reported for the first time. The results of the present study provide scientific basis for the popular use of Schinus lentiscifolius for a number of different health problems.
TI  - Metallo-beta-lactamases among Enterobacteriaceae from routine samples in an Italian tertiary-care hospital and long-term care facilities during 2008.
AB  - The emergence of metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae is a serious public health concern. Producers have been repeatedly isolated from patients and long-term care facility (LTCF) residents around Bolzano, and we sought to assess their prevalence and clinical impact. All routine Enterobacteriaceae isolates from a Bolzano tertiary-care hospital and associated long-term care facilities in 2008 (n = 5500) were screened for MBLs, with case details reviewed for the source patients. In total, 36 producers were obtained from 29 patients, comprising 14 Escherichia coli, six Klebsiella pneumoniae, four Klebsiella oxytoca, four Citrobacter freundii, two Enterobacter cloacae and two Morganella morganii, as well as single Citrobacter amalonaticus, Enterobacter aerogenes, Providencia stuartii and Proteus mirabilis isolates. All were PCR-positive for bla(VIM) and 25 were PCR-positive for qnrS; 19 non-K. pneumoniae had bla(SHV) and one had bla(CTX-M-group1); 13 were from 12 LTCF residents and 23 were from 17 acute-care patients. All these patients had serious underlying diseases with prolonged hospitalization or LTCF stay; only seven had infections due to the MBL producers, comprising four urinary tract infections, two catheter-related bloodstream infections and one patient with both a surgical site infection and pneumonia. Five patients had more than one MBL-producing organism. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis identified a cluster of six related E. coli, whereas pairs of K. pneumoniae and C. freundii isolates had >85% profile similarity. Transformants prepared from two isolates were shown to be PCR-positive for bla(VIM), qnrS and bla(SHV); their plasmids gave similar restriction fragment length polymorphism patterns, and bla(VIM-1), qnrS1 and bla(SHV-12) were detected by sequencing.
TI  - Novel CTX-M {beta}-lactamase genotype distribution and spread into multiple species of Enterobacteriaceae in Changsha, Southern China.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to undertake a survey of the occurrence of  CTX-M and SHV extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) genotypes in Enterobacteriaceae from Hunan Province, China. METHODS: Clinical isolates (425) from three major hospitals in Changsha, Hunan Province, were collected between October 2004 and July 2005, and their antimicrobial susceptibilities of the genotype of bla(CTX-M) and bla(SHV) were determined. Random amplified polymorphic DNA was used to characterize the clonality of all of the isolates. RESULTS: The overall rate of ESBL-positive isolates was 33.4% (142/425). The dominant ESBLs were CTX-M types, and were found in 109/142 (76.8%) isolates comprising seven different genera/species, namely Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Citrobacter freundii, Proteus vulgaris and Providencia stuartii. The most common bla(CTX-M) genotypes were bla(CTX-M-14) (47.7%), bla(CTX-M-3) (29.4%) and bla(CTX-M-15) (17.4%). A novel gene derived from bla(CTX-M-15), bla(CTX-M-82) (Ala-40-->Pro), was identified. CONCLUSIONS: The dominant ESBL genotype in Hunan Province was bla(CTX-M). The high prevalence (17.4%) of bla(CTX-M-15) has not previously been reported from China. Our results identify that an epidemic of bla(CTX-M) in Changsha, Hunan Province, has evolved with the appearance and spread of bla(CTX-M-15) against the dominant genotypes bla(CTX-M-14) and bla(CTX-M-3.) The worldwide dominance of bla(CTX-M-15) could be poised to spread to China, displacing the current prevailing genotypes.
TI  - Acid phosphatase/phosphotransferases from enteric bacteria.
AB  - We have investigated the enzymatic phosphorylation of nucleosides and found that  Morganella morganii phoC acid phosphatase exhibits regioselective pyrophosphate (PP(i))-nucleoside phosphotransferase activity. In this study, we isolated genes encoding an acid phosphatase with regioselective phosphotransferase activity (AP/PTase) from Providencia stuartii, Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia blattae and Klebsiella planticola, and compared the primary structures and enzymatic characteristics of these enzymes with those of AP/PTase (PhoC acid phosphatase) from M. morganii. The enzymes were highly homologous in primary structure with M. morganii AP/PTase, and are classified as class A1 acid phosphatases. The synthesis of inosine-5'-monophosphate (5'-IMP) by E. coli overproducing each acid phosphatase was investigated. The P. stuartii enzyme, which is most closely related to the M. morganii enzyme, exhibited high 5'-IMP productivity, similar to the M. morganii enzyme. The 5'-IMP productivities of the E. aerogenes, E. blattae and K. planticola enzymes were inferior to those of the former two enzymes. This result underlines the importance of lower K(m) values for efficient nucleotide production. As these enzymes exhibited a very high degree of homology at the amino acid sequence level, it is likely that local sequence differences in the binding pocket are responsible for the differences in the nucleoside-PP(i) phosphotransferase reaction.
TI  - Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae in community and private health care centers.
AB  - In 1999, 39 of 2,599 isolates of the family Enterobacteriaceae (1.5%) collected by eight private laboratories in the Aquitaine region in France produced an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL). Among these were 19 Enterobacter aerogenes isolates; 8 Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates; 6 Escherichia coli isolates; 3 Proteus mirabilis isolates; and 1 isolate each of Serratia marcescens, Morganella morganii, and Providencia stuartii. ESBL producers were isolated from 38 patients, including 33 residents of 11 clinics or nursing homes and 5 ambulatory patients. Seven different ESBLs were characterized. These mainly consisted of TEM-24 (25 isolates) and TEM-21 (9 isolates), but TEM-15 (2 isolates) and TEM-3, TEM-19, SHV-4, and CTX-M-1 (1 isolate each) were also characterized. Seven strains showed the coexistence of different TEM- and/or SHV-encoding genes, including a new SHV-1 variant, SHV-44, defined by the substitution R205L previously reported for SHV-3 in association with S238G. The epidemiology of the ESBL producers was investigated by random amplification of polymorphic DNA, typing by enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus PCR, analysis of resistance cotransferred with the ESBL, and analysis of the restriction profiles of the ESBL-encoding plasmids. Of the TEM-24-expressing strains, 18 were E. aerogenes isolates, including 9 from the same clinic, that were representatives of the epidemic clone disseminating in France. Of the TEM-21-producing strains that belonged to different species of the family Enterobacteriaceae (E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and P. mirabilis), 8 were isolated in the same nursing home. Outbreaks due to strain and/or plasmid dissemination in these clinic and nursing home were demonstrated. The presence of ESBL producers in five ambulatory patients probably resulted from nosocomial acquisition. Our data highlight the serious need to monitor patients for ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae in general practice.
TI  - [Yearly changes in antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates between 1996 and 2001--II. Gram-negative bacteria].
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2001 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems and carbapenems. A total of 3,245 strains in 32 species of Gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from January to December, and consisted of Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, Citrobacter koseri, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabillis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia spp. (P. alcalifaciens, P. rettgeri, P. stuartii), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas putida, Burkholderia cepacia, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Haemophilus influenzae, Acinetobactor baumannii, Acinetobactor lwoffii, Bacteroides fragilis group (B. fragilis, B. vulgatus, B. distasonis, B. ovatus, B. thetaiotaomicron), and Prevotella spp. (P. melaninogenica, P. intermedia, P. bivia, P. oralis, P. denticola). CZOP possessed stable antibacterial activities against M. (B.) catarrhalis, E. coli, C. freundii, C. koseri, K. pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, E. aerogenes, E. cloacae, S. marcescens, P. mirabilis, P. vulgaris, M. morganii, Providencia spp., P. aeruginosa, and A. lwoffii throughout 6 years. The MIC90 of CZOP against those strains were consistent with those obtained from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. On the other hand, the MIC90 of CZOP against H. influenzae yearly obviously increased with approximately 64-time difference during the study period. The MIC90 of cefpirome, cefepime, and flomoxef against H. influenzae also yearly tended to rise. The present results demonstrated that CZOP had maintained the antibacterial activity against almost Gram-negative strains tested. However, the decrease in antibacterial activities of CZOP against B. cepacia, and H. influenzae was suggested.
TI  - Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in enterobacteriaceae in Buenos Aires, Argentina, public hospitals.
AB  - Resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins is often associated with plasmid encoded extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL). In order to evaluate the prevalence and diversity of ESBLs in enterobacteria in our city, a 1-month-period survey was carried out from April to May 2000. Extended-spectrum-cephalosporin-resistant strains, isolated from inpatient clinical specimens other than stools, were collected among 17 participating hospitals. From a total of 427 enterobacterial strains that were collected during this period, 39 were extended-spectrum cephalosporin resistant. The National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards' Screening and Confirmatory Tests for ESBL production were performed using cefotaxime and ceftazidime; cefepime and cefepime-clavulanic acid-containing disks were included. beta-Lactamases were characterized by isoelectric focusing and PCR amplification using specific primers. Three different ESBLs were detected: SHV-related (4 isolates), PER-2-type (9 isolates), and CTX-M-2-related (26 isolates). Sequencing of the corresponding genes confirmed CTX-M-2 in 19 of 21 and CTX-M-31 (an allelic variant) in the remaining 2 of 21. CTX-M-2 (or its variant) was detected in all Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, and Providencia stuartii strains, while PER-2 was detected in Enterobacter cloacae, E. aerogenes, and Klebsiella pneumoniae; SHV-related ESBL were found only in K. pneumoniae. These results clearly show that CTX-M-2 is the most prevalent ESBL produced by enterobacterial species isolated from public hospitals in Buenos Aires.
TI  - Characterization of clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae from Italy by the BD  Phoenix extended-spectrum beta-lactamase detection method.
AB  - Production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) is an important mechanism of beta-lactam resistance in Enterobacteriaceae: Identification of ESBLs based on phenotypic tests is the strategy most commonly used in clinical microbiology laboratories. The Phoenix ESBL test (BD Diagnostic Systems, Sparks, Md.) is a recently developed automated system for detection of ESBL-producing gram-negative bacteria. An algorithm based on phenotypic responses to a panel of cephalosporins (ceftazidime plus clavulanic acid, ceftazidime, cefotaxime plus clavulanic acid, cefpodoxime, and ceftriaxone plus clavulanic acid) was used to test 510 clinical isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia stuartii, Morganella morganii, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter freundii, and Citrobacter koseri. Of these isolates, 319 were identified as ESBL producers, and the remaining 191 were identified as non-ESBL producers based on the results of current phenotypic tests. Combined use of isoelectric focusing, PCR, and/or DNA sequencing demonstrated that 288 isolates possessed bla(TEM-1)- and/or bla(SHV-1)-derived genes, and 28 had a bla(CTX-M) gene. Among the 191 non-ESBL-producing isolates, 77 isolates produced an AmpC-type enzyme, 110 isolates possessed TEM-1, TEM-2, or SHV-1 beta-lactamases, and the remaining four isolates (all K. oxytoca strains) hyperproduced K1 chromosomal beta-lactamase. The Phoenix ESBL test system gave positive results for all the 319 ESBL-producing isolates and also for two of the four K1-hyperproducing isolates of K. oxytoca. Compared with the phenotypic tests and molecular analyses, the Phoenix system displayed 100% sensitivity and 98.9% specificity. These findings suggest that the Phoenix ESBL test can be a rapid and reliable method for laboratory detection of ESBL resistance in gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - [Yearly changes in antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates between 1996 and 2000--II. Gram-negative bacteria].
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2000 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, and carbapenems. Thirty-two species 2,697 strains of Gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from January to December, and consisted of Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis (n = 125), Escherichia coli (n = 250), Citrobacter freundii (n = 153), Citrobacter koseri (n = 97), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 150), Klebsiella oxytoca (n = 100), Enterobacter aerogenes (n = 50), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 125), Serratia marcescens (n = 153), Proteus mirabillis (n = 103), Proteus vulgaris (n = 77), Morganella morganii (n = 141), Providencia spp. (P. alcalifaciens, P. rettgeri, P. stuartii; n = 154), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 211), Pseudomonas putida (n = 49), Burkholderia cepacia (n = 102), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 101), Haemophilus influenzae (n = 210), Acinetobactor baumannii (n = 63), Acinetobactor Iwoffii (n = 30), Bacteroides fragilis group (B. fragilis, B. vulgatus, B. distasonis, B. ovatus, B. thetaiotaomicron; n = 129), and Prevotella spp. (P. melaninogenica, P. intermedia, P. bivia, P. oralis, P. denticola; n = 124). CZOP possessed stable antibacterial activities against M. (B.) catarrhalis, E. coli, C. freundii, C. koseri, K. pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, E. aerogenes, E. cloacae, S. marcescens, P. mirabilis, P. vulgaris, M. morganii, Providencia spp., P. aeruginosa, and A. lowffii throughout 5 years. The MIC90 of CZOP against those strains were consistent with those obtained from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. On the other hand, the MIC90 of CZOP against H. influenzae yearly obviously increased with approximately 65-time difference during study period. The MIC90 of cefpirome, cefepime, and flomoxef against H. influenzae also yearly tended to rise. The present results demonstrated that CZOP had maintained the antibacterial activity against almost Gram-negative strains tested. However, the decrease in the antibacterial activity of CZOP against H. influenzae was suggested.
TI  - Prevalence of extended spectrum beta-lactamases among Enterobacteriaceae: an Italian survey.
AB  - The prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) production by consecutive non-repeated isolates of Enterobacteriaceae was determined over a 6-month period. A total of 8015 strains were isolated from ten Italian laboratories and 509 (6.3%) of these were designated ESBL producers from the results of a double-disk synergy test. Escherichia coli was the most isolated microrganism, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis. Providencia stuartii (28.1%) was the most frequently isolated ESBL producer, followed by K. pneumoniae and Enterobacter aerogenes (20.5%). However, amongst all ESBL producers, K. pneumoniae (38.2%) was the most represented followed by P. mirabilis (25.7%). All the strains positive to DD tests were confirmed for the carriage of TEM and SHV genes using colony-blot hybridisation (CH). A total of 447 strains (88.0%) were CH-positive, of which 42.3% hybridised with the TEM-type probe, 30.1% with the SHV-type probe and 15.6% with both probes. In conclusion, our findings indicate that 6.3% of all Enterobacteriaceae tested produced ESBLs, 42.3% of which were TEM-derived enzymes. More than 20% of P. stuartii, K. pneumoniae and E. aerogenes harbour these enzymes. The double-disk test seems to be a useful test to identify ESBL producing strains.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin in a North American surveillance study.
AB  - The in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, was compared to three marketed fluoroquinolones; ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin against over 4,000 recent clinical isolates covering 29 species isolated in the United States and Canada between 1997-1999. Based on MIC(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent fluoroquinolone tested against a majority of Gram-positive isolates: Streptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin resistant S. pneumoniae, macrolide resistant S. pneumoniae, ciprofloxacin non-susceptible (MIC > or = 4 microg/mL) S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, viridans streptococci, Enterococcus faecalis, methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. hemolyticus, and S. saprophyticus. Against Enterobacteriaceae and aerobic non-Enterobacteriaceae Gram-negatives, gemifloxacin was usually comparable to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and more potent than ofloxacin for the following species: Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Morganella morganii, Proteus mirabilis, P. vulgaris, Providencia stuartii, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter lwoffii, A. baumannii, Burkholderia cepacia, Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Gemifloxacin was generally 16-64 fold more potent than the other fluoroquinolones tested against Gram-positive organisms and retains excellent activity comparable with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin against a majority of Gram-negative pathogens.
TI  - gyrA mutations associated with fluoroquinolone resistance in eight species of Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - Fluoroquinolone resistance (FQ-R) in clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae species has been reported with increasing frequency in recent years. Two mechanisms of FQ-R have been identified in gram-negative organisms: mutations in DNA gyrase and reduced intracellular drug accumulation. A single point mutation in gyrA has been shown to reduce susceptibility to fluoroquinolones. To determine the extent of gyrA mutations associated with FQ-R in enteric bacteria, one set of oligonucleotide primers was selected from conserved sequences in the flanking regions of the quinolone resistance-determining regions (QRDR) of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. This set of primers was used to amplify and sequence the QRDRs from 8 Enterobacteriaceae type strains and 60 fluoroquinolone-resistant clinical isolates of Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Providencia stuartii, and Serratia marcescens. Although similarity of the nucleotide sequences of seven species ranged from 80.8 to 93.3%, when compared with that of E. coli, the amino acid sequences of the gyrA QRDR were highly conserved. Conservative amino acid substitutions were detected in the QRDRs of the susceptible type strains of C. freundii, E. aerogenes, K. oxytoca (Ser-83 to Thr), and P. stuartii (Asp-87 to Glu). Strains with ciprofloxacin MICs of >2 microg/ml expressed amino acid substitutions primarily at the Gly-81, Ser-83, or Asp-87 position. Fluoroquinolone MICs varied significantly for strains exhibiting identical gyrA mutations, indicating that alterations outside gyrA contribute to resistance. The type and position of amino acid alterations also differed among these six genera. High-level FQ-R frequently was associated with single gyrA mutations in all species of Enterobacteriaceae in this study except E. coli.
TI  - Susceptibility of bacterial isolates to beta-lactam antibiotics from U.S. clinical trials over a 5-year period.
AB  - Results are reported for agar dilution susceptibility testing of 3,075 isolates of aerobic bacteria collected from >200 U.S. institutions, located in 30 different states. These isolates were collected from 1987 through 1991 from patients who participated in cefepime clinical trials. Cefepime susceptibility was compared with ceftazidime, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, cefoperazone, and imipenem. To avoid duplication of strains, only initial isolates were included. Cefepime minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC90) values for Enterobacteriaceae were < or = 0.5 microg/mL, except for two species, Citrobacter freundii and Providencia stuartii, with MIC90 values of 2 and 1, respectively. The MIC90 values of the other cephalosporins were higher, especially for Enterobacter aerogenes and C. freundii. The MIC90 values of cefepime for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (4 microg/mL) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8 microg/mL) were similar to those of cefotaxime for S. aureus (4 microg/mL), and to ceftazidime for P. aeruginosa (8 microg/mL). Streptococcus pneumoniae was similar in susceptibility to cefotaxime at 0.06 microg/mL. The activity of cefepime against a diverse group of gram-positive and gram-negative (1987-1991) bacteria isolates demonstrates the excellent activity of cefepime compared to third-generation cephalosporins and imipenem, particularly among C. freundii and E. aerogenes isolates, which were often resistant to other cephalosporins.
TI  - [Antibacterial activities of sisomicin against fresh clinical isolates].
AB  - To investigate antibacterial activities of sisomicin (SISO), MICs of SISO as well as other aminoglycosides (AGs) were determined against many clinical isolates which were obtained in 1991. Results are summarized below: 1. No SISO-resistant strains were observed among isolates of Escherichia coli, Citrobacter diversus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis and Morganella morganii. 2. In comparison with the results of our previous study against isolates obtained in 1986, the rate of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was higher, and SISO-resistant strains were observed at a high rate among the MRSA. Also, SISO-resistant strains of Serratia marcescens increased. However, the rate of SISO-resistant strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa decreased, and among Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae and Proteus vulgaris, SISO-resistant strains did not increase over the years. 3. MICs of SISO against Providencia rettgeri and Providencia stuartii were high, suggesting that antibacterial activities of SISO was weak against genus Providencia. 4. For comparison, according to MICs of ofloxacin and imipenem, new quinolone-resistant strains were observed at a high rate among various organisms, and carbapenem-resistant strains were observed at a high rate among S. marcescens and P. aeruginosa. 5. SISO is still one of the useful AGs in the 1990's since it maintains its strong antibacterial activities against most clinical isolates obtained in recent years and its potential as a combination drug with beta-lactams is being reported.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents. A study mainly focused on imipenem. Reported by the Research Group for Testing Imipenem Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (IPM) and other antibacterial agents at 64 hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1988. In this study, identification and susceptibility testing were carried out at each laboratory and the tests were performed according to the disk dilution method recommended by NCCLS in which susceptibilities are classified into "S", "MS", "I" and "R". IPM showed markedly high in vitro activities against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Salmonella spp., Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia rettgeri, Providencia stuartii, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, Alcaligenes spp., Peptococcus spp./Peptostreptococcus spp., Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides spp. IPM also had strong activities against Achromobacter xylosoxidans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but less active against Flavobacterium spp., E. faecium, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas cepacia. In a study in which activities of IPM against bacteria isolated from different clinical sources were compared, differences in susceptibilities were observed among S. aureus, CNS, A. calcoaceticus and P. aeruginosa, but such differences were not apparent among S. pneumoniae, E. faecalis, H. influenzae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, C. freundii, S. marcescens or P. mirabilis.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents. A study mainly focused on imipenem. Research Group for Testing Imipenem Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - We investigated susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (IPM) and other antimicrobial agents at 459 hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1988. In this study, identification and susceptibility testing were performed at each hospital laboratory and the tests were carried out according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc technique in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, + and -. IPM had significantly high activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Salmonella spp., Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia rettgeri, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Moraxella catarrhalis, Alcaligenes spp., Peptococcus spp./Peptostreptococcus spp., Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides spp. and should slightly lower activities on coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), Enterococcus faecalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus vulgaris, Providencia stuartii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa than on the above mentioned bacteria. In a comparative study on activities of IPM against bacteria from different clinical sources, no remarkable differences were found due to different sources among S. pneumoniae, E. faecalis, H. influenzae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, C. freundii, P. mirabilis or A. calcoaceticus, whereas slight differences were found among Staphylococcus aureus, CNS, S. marcescens and P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of imipenem against 1386 clinical isolates.
AB  - 1386 isolates from clinical specimens were tested against imipenem by disc agar diffusion. The bacteria used in this study consisted of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. agglomerans, E. cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, K. ozanae, Proteus mirabilis, P. vulgaris, Providencia stuartii, P. rettgeri, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Citrobacter diversus, C. freundii, Morganella morganii, Serratia liquefaciens, S. marcescens, Hafnia alvei, Aeromonas hydrophila, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. cepacia, P. maltophila, P. fluorescens, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, S. saprophyticus, pneumococcus, Lancefield group A, B and D streptococci, viridans streptococci, diphtheroids and Bacillus species. In vitro activity of imipenem was compared with the following antibiotics: ampicillin, amikacin, carbenicillin, cefoperazone, cefoxitin, cephalothin, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, colistin, erythromycin, gentamicin, methicillin, penicillin, tetracycline, tobramycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and vancomycin. Of the 819 strains of Enterobacteriaceae tested, 99.5% were susceptible to imipenem. Ninety-seven percent strains of P. aeruginosa were also susceptible to imipenem. All the 161 isolates of S. aureus and 116 of the 117 isolates of enterococci exhibited in vitro susceptibility to this antibiotic. All gram positive bacteria tested were inhibited by imipenem except 28% isolates of S. epidermidis and 5% isolates of S. agalactiae.
TI  - In vitro activity of aztreonam against gram negative bacteria from clinical specimens and its comparison with other commonly used antibiotics.
AB  - A total of 755 gram negative bacteria isolated from clinical specimens were tested against aztreonam by the disc agar diffusion test. The strains of bacteria used in this study consisted of Escherichia coli (314), Enterobacter aerogenes (30), E. agglomerans (7), E. cloacae, (39), Citrobacter diversus (9), C. freundii (13), Hafnia alvei (3), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (10), Klebsiella oxytoca (6), K. ozaenae (5), K. pneumoniae (107), Morganella morganii (3), Moraxella sp. (10), Pasteurella multocida (1), Proteus mirabilis (66), P. vulgaris (4), Providencia rettgeri (12), P. stuartii (5), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (85), P. fluorescens (2), P. maltophila (7), Salmonella sp. (1) and Serratia marcescens (17). In vitro activity against aztreonam was compared with amikacin, ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalosporin, cefoxitin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, nitrofurantoin, piperacillin, tetracycline, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim and tobramycin. Over 99% of E. coli and Enterobacter species were susceptible to aztreonam. All the 118 strains of Klebsiella, 87 strains of Proteus-Providencia and 17 strains of S. marcescens were also susceptible. Aztreonam also showed good activity against P. aeruginosa, inhibiting 90% of the 85 isolates tested.
TI  - Inducible type I beta-lactamases of gram-negative bacteria and resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  - Mutants, showing either constitutive (depressed) or non-inducible expression of chromosomally-mediated Type I beta-lactamase were obtained from clinical isolates of Enterobacter cloacae, Ent. aerogenes, Citrobacter freundii, Providencia stuartii, Morganella morganii, Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The wild-type and mutant strains were compared for susceptibility to a range of beta-lactam antibiotics. Derepression of beta-lactamase synthesis generally, but not always, resulted in a marked reduction in susceptibility to the agents tested, including the '3rd generation' cephalosporins. In many cases, the observed resistance would preclude, or severely compromise, the therapeutic efficacy of the drugs. In this context, depressed mutants of Enterobacter spp., Citro. freundii and Ps. aeruginosa could be of primary concern although those of Ser. marcescens, Prov. stuartii and Morg. morganii often exhibited equally high resistance levels to older beta-lactams. Comparison of the susceptibilities of the non-inducible mutants with that of their inducible parents suggested variation in the beta-lactamase inductive potency of different compounds in different organisms. For example, cefoxitin was a powerful inducer in Ent. cloacae, Citro. freundii and one strain of Ps. aeruginosa; similarly cefazolin and cefuroxime were good beta-lactamase inducers in Ser. marcescens and Morg. morganii. Aminothiazolyl-oxime cephalosporins and ureido-penicillins were generally poor inducers. From such comparisons, the contribution of inducible Type I beta-lactamase to resistance phenotype could be ascertained.
TI  - In vitro studies on the antibacterial activities of YM-13115, a new broad-spectrum cephalosporin.
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activities of YM-13115, a new parenteral cephalosporin, were compared with those of ceftazidime, cefoperazone, and cefsulodin. The compound was highly active against the common members of the Enterobacteriaceae and 2 to 256 times more active than cefoperazone. YM-13115 was as active as ceftazidime against Citrobacter freundii, Proteus vulgaris, and Morganella morganii and two to four times more active than ceftazidime against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia rettgeri, and Providencia stuartii. The activity of YM-13115 against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (with MICs of 0.78 and 3.13 micrograms/ml for 50 and 90% of the isolates, respectively) was ca. 2 times that of ceftazidime, 4 times that of cefsulodin, and 16 times that of cefoperazone. Against Haemophilus influenzae YM-13115 was more active than ceftazidime. YM-13115 was less active than ceftazidime, cefoperazone, and cefsulodin against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. The concentrations of YM-13115 required to inhibit the growth of 90% of the isolates of Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae were 0.78 and 1.56 microgram/ml, respectively, but concentrations above 100 micrograms/ml were required to inhibit Streptococcus faecalis. YM-13115 was not hydrolyzed by the common plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases. YM-13115 is extremely active against P. aeruginosa and members of the Enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of FR 17027, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  - FR 17027, a new orally absorbed cephalosporin ester, inhibited group A and B streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae at less than or equal to 0.1 micrograms/ml, which is similar to the inhibition concentration of amoxicillin and cefaclor, and was more active than cephalexin. It was less active (MIC, 25 micrograms/ml) against staphylococci than was cephalexin, and it did not inhibit Streptococcus faecalis or Listeria monocytogenes. FR 17027 inhibited beta-lactamase-producing isolates of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Branhamella catarrhalis at less than 0.1 micrograms/ml and was more active than cefaclor or cephalexin against these bacteria. FR 17027 inhibited Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella oxytoca, Providencia stuartii, Providencia rettgeri, and Citrobacter diversus at less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, including isolated resistant to amoxicillin, cephalexin, and cefaclor, but it was less active than ceftizoxime. Some strains of Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter agglomerans, Citrobacter freundii, and Enterobacter aerogenes were resistant (MIC, greater than 25 micrograms/ml). FR 17027 did not inhibit Pseudomonas aeruginosa, other Pseudomonas species, Acinetobacter species, or Bacteroides species. Activity was minimally affected by growth conditions. FR 17027 was not hydrolyzed by the common beta-lactamases present in many of the pathogens causing respiratory and urinary tract infections in outpatients.
TI  - [Interest of gamma-glutamyltransferase in "Enterobacteriaceae" (author's transl)].
AB  - Gamma-Glutamyltransferase (gammaGT) could be detected in 86,6% of 3,027 strains of Enterobacteriaceae, by the use of gamma-L-glutamin-p-nitranilide acid for substrate. The following species produced gamma GT: Citrobacter freundii, Levinea malonatica, L. amalonatica, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, K. ozaenae, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. cloacae, E. agglomerans, E. gergoviae, K. ozaenae, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. cloacae, E. agglomerans, E. gergoviae, Hafnia alvei, Erwinia carotovora, Serratia marcescens, S. liquefaciens, S. plymuthica, S. marinorubra, S. odorifera, S. ficaria, Proteus vulgaris, P. mirabilis, P. morganii, P. rettgeri, Providencia alcalifaciens, P. stuartii, Yersinia enterocolitica and Y. pseudotuberculosis. Most strains of Escherichia coli and Alkalescens Dispar group are gamma GT+. The following species did not produce gammaGT: Shigella sonnei, Edwardsiella tarda, Klebsiella rhinoscleromatis and Yersinia pestis. Within the Salmonella, most strains of subgenus I, II and IV, and diphasic strains of subgenus III (S. arizonae) produced gamma GT, whereas monophasic strains of subgenus III did not produce gammaGT. Salmonella enteritidis (gammaGT+) and S. dublin (gammaGT-) can readily be distinguished. This test (gammaGT) could also serve as a biochemical marker for S. typhi-murium strains. Shigella dysenteriae serotypes 3 to 9 were gammaGT+ whereas other serotypes were gammaGT-. Within S. flexneri serotype 6, varieties Boyd 88 and Newcastle were found gammaGT+; and varieties Sussex and Manchester were gammaGT-. The use of gammaGT test as an epidemiological marker for other Shigella serotypes is suggested.
TI  - Intracellular crystalline deposits by bacteria grown in urine from a stone former.
AB  - Several species of bacteria were found to form an intracellular crystalline material when grown in urine obtained from a subject with a history of infrequent renal calculi formation. The following species: Proteus mirabilis, Proteus rettgeri, Providencia stuartii, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, and Candida albicans formed crystals of hydroxyapatite. Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus vulgaris produced crystals of calcite -II. Several of these bacteria have been isolated from the kidneys of patients with renal caculi indicationg that microorganisms may be involved in the nucleation process during calculogenesis.
TI  - Formation of crystalline deposits by several genera of the family Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - Several species of bacteria from the family Enterobacteriaceae formed crystalline materials containing calcium when grown in a defined culture medium. Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus vulgaris, Citrobacter freundii, and C. intermedius produced calcium pyrophosphate crystals. Edwardsiella tarda and Escherichia coli formed calcite III crystals, whereas Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Providencia stuartii, and Serratia marcescens produced hydroxyapatite crystals. Several of these bacteria have been isolated from the kidneys of patients with kidney stones, indicating that microorganisms may be involved in the enucleation process of kidney stone formation.
TI  - Use of bile-esculin agar for rapid differentiation of Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - Bile-esculin agar has been used for several years for the presumptive identification of group D streptococci. All members of the Enterobacteriaceae family will also grow on this medium, but only certain ones can hydrolyze esculin to 6,7-dihydroxycoumarin, which reacts with iron to produce a characteristic blackening of the medium. One thousand and six cultures from clinical specimens representing 20 genera were isolated and identified. Heavy inocula from fresh pure culture isolates on heart infusion agar were placed on bile-esculin agar slants and incubated at 35 C. The slants were examined at 4 h and again at 18 h for esculin hydrolysis. Shigella, Salmonella, Arizona, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus morganii, Providencia alcalifaciens, and Providencia stuartii all produced negative results. Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, and Serratia rubidaea produced a positive reaction in 4 h. The other remaining eight genera exhibited varying results. The use of this medium in conjunction with triple sugar iron-lysine iron agar has been of great value in differentiating the Klebsiella-Enterobacter-Serratia group from other Enterobacteriaceae.
