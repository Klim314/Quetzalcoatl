TI  == mitracarpus frigidus aerial parts exhibited potent antimicrobial, antileishmanial, and antioxidant effects.
AB  == the crude extract and the hexane, ch(2)cl(2), etoac, n-buoh, and hydromethanolic  fractions of the aerial parts of mitracarpus frigidus were evaluated against promastigote forms of two species of leishmania (l. chagasi and l. amazonensis),  11 strains of bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella enterica sorovar tythimurium, shigella sonnei, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, micrococcus luteus, enterococcus faecalis, enterobacter cloacae, streptococcus pyogenes and bacillus cereus) and two yeasts (candida albicans and  cryptococcus neoformans). the antioxidant activity (dpph radical scavenging activity and reducing power), cytotoxicity against mammalian cells, and the contents of phenolics and flavonoids were determined. phytochemical analysis of the major groups of phytoconstituents is also reported. all samples showed antioxidant activity which was positively correlated to the content of phenolic compounds. s. sonnei, b. cereus and c. neoformans were susceptible to all extracts tested, except for the n-buoh and hydromethanolic fractions, which demonstrated no antimicrobial activity. the lowest mic was recorded for the ch(2)cl(2) fraction against c. neoformans (mic of 10 microg/ml), followed by b. cereus, s. sonnei, and e. cloacae (mic of 20, 39 and 39 microg/ml, respectively). the ch(2)cl(2) fraction was the most effective against l. chagasi (ic(50) of 6.7  microg/ml), and the hydromethanolic fraction exhibited the best activity against  l. amazonensis (ic(50) of 9 microg/ml). a cytotoxic effect on mammalian cells was observed only for the crude extract and ch(2)cl(2) fraction at the concentrations of 130 and 31 microg/ml, respectively. these results suggest that m. frigidus has interesting antimicrobial, antileishmanial and antioxidant activities.

TI  == antibacterial activity of thymus daenensis methanolic extract.
AB  == medicinal plants are potential of antimicrobial compounds. the present study deals with the antibacterial activity of methanolic extract of thymus daenensis.  aerial parts of the plant were collected from alvand mountainside (hamadan, iran) in may 2005, air-dried and extracted by methanol. the dried extract was redissolved in methanol to make a 100 mg/ml solution and then filtered. antibacterial activity of the extract was evaluated against various gram-positive and gram-negatives bacteria using disk diffusion technique. blank paper disks were loaded with 40 microl of the methanol solution and then dried up. the impregnated disks were placed on mueller-hinton agar inoculated with bacterial suspension equal to 0.5 mcfarland. the extract inhibited the growth gram-positive bacteria, i.e., staphylococcus aureus, micrococcus luteus, entrococcus faecalis,  streptococcus pyogenes, but it showed no activity against gram-negative bacteria. the most significant effect was seen against s.aureus including mrsa, which are important nosocomial pathogens. mic90 of the extract was determined against gram-positive bacteria (3.12 mg/ml) and 11 mrsa strain (1.56 mg/ml).

TI  == production of the lantibiotic salivaricin a and its variants by oral streptococci and use of a specific induction assay to detect their presence in human saliva.
AB  == salivaricin a (sala), the first streptococcus salivarius lantibiotic to be characterized, appears to be inhibitory to most streptococcus pyogenes strains. a variant of the sala structural gene (sala1) is present in more than 90% of s. pyogenes strains, but only strains of m serotype 4 and t pattern 4 produce the biologically active peptide. the present study identifies four additional variants (sala2 to sala5) of the sala structural gene and demonstrates that each  of the corresponding inhibitory peptides (sala2 to sala5) is produced in vitro. these variants appear to be similar to sala and sala1 in their inhibitory activity against micrococcus luteus and in their ability to act as inducers of sala production. it had previously been shown that s. pyogenes strain sf370 had a deletion (of approximately 2.5 kb) in the salm and salt genes of the sala1 locus. in the present study, several additional characteristic deletions within the sala1 loci were identified. s. pyogenes strains of the same m serotype all share  the same sala1 locus structure. since s. salivarius is a predominant member of the normal oral flora of healthy humans, strains producing anti-s. pyogenes lantibiotics, such as sala, may have excellent potential for use as oral probiotics. in the present study, we have used a highly specific sala induction system to directly detect the presence of sala in the saliva of humans who either naturally harbor populations of sala-producing s. salivarius or who have been colonized with the sala2-producing probiotic s. salivarius k12.

TI  == correlation of the antibacterial activities of cationic peptide antibiotics and cationic steroid antibiotics.
AB  == the antibacterial activities of cationic steroid antibiotics and cationic peptide antibiotics have been compared. depolarization of bacterial membranes, activation of bacterial stress-related gene promoters, and changes in bacterial morphologies caused by these antibiotics suggest that cationic steroid and peptide antibiotics share mechanistic aspects. modified cationic steroid antibiotics display improved selectivity for prokaryotic cells over eukaryotic cells presumably due to increased charge recognition.

TI  == serum concentrations and ex vivo inhibitory/bactericidal activity of clindamycin  after administration of two oral dosages.
AB  == two dosages of clindamycin, 300 and 600 mg, were given orally to 10 patients each. the patients were admitted for minor elective surgery. their mean age was 39.3 years; mean weight was 67.5 kg. none of them had taken antibiotics for at least 1 month. after administration of a single dose, blood samples were obtained at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 h after dosing. drug levels were determined by the bioassay method using micrococcus luteus as test organism. serum inhibitory and bactericidal activities against five isolates each of staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes were determined by the microdilution method according to the national committee for clinical laboratory  standards guidelines. the mean peak serum level was 3.4 mg/l for the 300-mg dose  and 4.8 mg/l for the 600-mg dose. the mean reciprocal peak inhibitory titers for  the 300-/600-mg doses were 13.7/23.8 and 15.2/34.7 against s. aureus and s. pyogenes, respectively. most serum samples did not show bactericidal activity against s. aureus.

TI  == interactions of human mannose-binding protein with lipoteichoic acids.
AB  == we explored the interaction of human recombinant mannose-binding protein and lipoteichoic acids (ltas) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. the best ligand was micrococcus luteus lipomannan, followed by enterococcus spp. lta containing mono-, di-, and oligoglucosyl substituents. ltas lacking terminal sugars (those of streptococcus pyogenes and staphylococcus aureus) or containing galactosyl substituents (those of listeria spp. and lactococcus spp.) were poor ligands. these results are consistent with known structural requirements for binding through the mannose-binding protein carbohydrate recognition domain.

TI  == tissue distribution of antibiotics in the intervertebral disc.
AB  == study design: this study analyzed the distribution of antibiotics within the intervertebral disc of rabbits. specimens were tested with specific antibodies against antibiotics using an immunofluorescent technique. objectives: the results were correlated to provide a rationale for perioperative prophylaxis of infection. summary of background data: several groups of investigators and the recent data from our laboratory showed quantitative changes in penetration of antibiotics into intervertebral disc. no previous study has assessed antibiotic distribution in anulus fibrosus and nucleus pulposus. methods: discs were obtained from rabbits after intravenous injection of penicillin or gentamicin. antibiotics were localized in tissue sections using specific antibodies with a immunofluorescent method. results: penicillin (negatively charged) and gentamicin (positively charged) penetrated the neutrally charged anulus fibrosus, but penicillin had less ability than gentamicin to penetrate into the negatively charged nucleus pulposus. conclusion: our data suggest that penetration and distribution of antibiotics into avascular intervertebral disc is significantly influenced by the charge of antibiotics.

TI  == characterization of microbial flora of leprous ulcers infested with maggots.
AB  == swabs from 64 maggot infested leprosy ulcers before and after treatment for maggots and 100 non-infested leprosy ulcers were studied for the bacterial flora. from maggot infested ulcers (before treatment), the cultures usually showed mixed growth. among the gram positive isolates, staphylococcus aureus (37%), s. albus (18%) and streptococcus pyogenes (36%) were frequently isolated. gram negative bacteria isolated were proteus spp. (21%) and escherichia coli (7%). anaerobic bacteria isolated were micrococcus (3%) and bacteroides (4%). after treatment of  maggot infested ulcers, s. aureus (36%) continued to be isolated with almost the  same frequency. the isolates of other gram negative organisms were slightly reduced. among the gram negatives the proteus spp. (10%) were also less in number. in few cases neisseria (3%) was found. anaerobic isolates were m. luteus  (2%) and b. necrophorus (3%). from the cases without maggot infestation, a single organism was isolated from 16 cases and 84 mixed cultures were obtained. isolates included the aerobic gram positives s. aureus (46%), s. albus (21%) and s. pyogenes (38%), and the gram negative proteus spp. (19%) and e. coli (7%). the anaerobic isolate was m. luteus (3%). from this study no apparent association between the type of bacterial flora and maggot infestation could be observed.

TI  == macrophage response to bacteria: induction of marked secretory and cellular activities by lipoteichoic acids.
AB  == lipoteichoic acids (ltas) from various bacterial species, including staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, and listeria monocytogenes, were examined for the ability  to induce secretory and cellular responses in a pure population of bone marrow-derived mononuclear phagocytes. some of the highly purified ltas, in particular ltas from bacillus subtilis, s. pyogenes, e. faecalis, and enterococcus hirae, were able to affect each of the macrophage parameters measured, i.e., reductive capacity, secretion of tumor necrosis factor and nitrite, and tumoricidal activity. as after stimulation with whole organisms or other bacterial products, secretion of tumor necrosis factor induced by these ltas reached its maximum within the first few hours of the interaction, while secretion of nitrite and tumoricidal activity required 24 to 36 h for full expression. other purified ltas, i.e., ltas from streptococcus sanguis, s. pneumoniae, and l. monocytogenes, as well as lipomannan from micrococcus luteus affected only some of these parameters, while native lta from s. aureus was inactive. there was no obvious correlation between biological activity and chain  length, kind of glycosyl substituents, glycolipid structures, or fatty acid composition of ltas. deacylation of ltas resulted in a complete loss of activity, and deacylated ltas did not impair the activity of their acylated counterparts, suggesting that acyl chains may be essential for binding of lta to the cell surface. the results demonstrate that some lta species are potent inducers of macrophage secretory and cellular activities.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of sphingosines.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of stratum corneum lipids was examined by screening in vitro various representative phospholipids and sphingolipids. of mixed galacto-cerebrosides; phosphatidic acid; phosphatidic acid-monomethylester-dioleoyl; phosphatidylethanolamine; phosphatidylethanolamine-beta-oleoyl-gamma-palmitoyl; phosphatidylcholine; d-sphingosine; d,l-sphinganine; 4-d-hydroxysphinganine; oleoyl-sphingosine; n,n-dimethylsphingosine; and stearylamine, only the sphingosines and, to a lesser extent, stearylamine were clearly and profoundly effective against staphylococcus aureus (4-log reduction at 6.25 micrograms/ml [20 microm]; 2-log reduction at 0.78 mu/ml [2.5 microm]). the sphingosines were similarly active against streptococcus pyogenes, micrococcus luteus, propionibacterium acnes, brevibacterium epidermidis, and candida albicans, moderately active against pseudomonas aeruginosa, and ineffective against escherichia coli and serratia marcescens. both erythro- and threo-isomers were effective. optimal inhibition was at 60 min incubation at 37 degrees c and at ph 6.5. antimicrobial activity, which was ca++ dependent, was confirmed in vivo by topical application and microbial challenge. because free sphingosines are available in the stratum corneum and other epidermal layers, these lipids may contribute to the cutaneous  antimicrobial barrier.

TI  == inverse correlation in nutritionally variant streptococci between the production  of bacteriolytic activity and sensitivity to a streptococcus pyogenes bacteriocinlike inhibitory substance.
AB  == nineteen strains of nutritionally variant streptococci (nvs) were tested for bacteriolytic activity and for their production of and sensitivity to streptococcal bacteriocinlike inhibitory substances (blis). none appeared to produce blis. an inverse relationship was found between the sensitivity to blis and the production of bacteriolytic activity against micrococcus luteus. all but  one of the 14 streptococcus defectivus isolates were sensitive to the blis of s.  pyogenes p5, and these isolates were nonlytic. the five s. adjacens isolates were not sensitive to any blis tested, and all of these isolates displayed bacteriolytic activity. sensitivity to the blis of s. agalactiae p3 separated the nonlytic s. defectivus strains into two categories.

TI  == [studies of antigens related to metabolic and growth inhibitions of staphylococcus aureus l-form].
AB  == metabolic and growth inhibiting activities in immunoglobulin (of anti-s. aureus l-form serum and anti-s. aureus coccal form serum) could be absorbed by cell membranes of s. aureus l-form and its coccal form, respectively. these activities could not be absorbed by cell membrane of micrococcus luteus, streptococcus pyogenes or actinomyces viscosus. these findings suggested the existence of species-specific antigens of cell membrane. the membrane antigens of l-form related to the metabolic and growth inhibiting activities were stable to trypsin, heating and periodate, and were not solubilized by trypsin. a large part of the antigen in a typsin-insoluble membrane precipitate of l-form could be extracted by acetone and the subsequent use of chloroform-methanol (2: 1). a fractionation  study of chloroform-methanol extract by using silicic acid calum indicated that more than two components were involved in metabolic and growth inhibiting activities.

TI  == detection of bacterial cell wall hydrolases after denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
AB  == cell walls from various gram-positive bacteria were incorporated at a concentration of 0.2% (w/v) into polyacrylamide gels as a substrate for detection of cell wall hydrolases. bacterial extracts from crude cell wall preparations were denatured with sodium dodecyl sulfate and 2-mercaptoethanol and subjected to denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in gels containing bacterial cell walls. after renaturation in the presence of purified and buffered 1% (v/v) triton x-100, cell wall hydrolases were visualized as clear lytic zones against the opaque cell wall background. one to fifteen bands with lytic activity could be detected, depending on bacterial extracts and on the nature of the cell walls  incorporated into gels. crude cell wall extracts were the best source of cell wall hydrolases from various gram-positive bacteria such as clostridium perfringens (15 bands), micrococcus luteus (1 band), bacillus megaterium (4 bands), bacillus sp. (6 bands), b. cereus (3 bands), b. subtilis (7 bands), staphylococcus aureus (13 bands), streptococcus faecalis (3 bands), and strep. pyogenes (5 bands). molecular masses of cell wall hydrolases ranged from 17 to 114.6 kda. lytic activities against cell walls of corynebacterium sepedonicum (clavibacter michiganense pv. sepedonicum) could be shown with the cell wall extracts of strep. pyogenes (45.7 kda), strep. faecalis (67 kda), b. megaterium (67 kda), and staph. aureus (67 kda).

TI  == [antibacterial spectrum of lisosubtilin g10x].
AB  == data on the antibacterial spectrum of lysosubtilin g10x, a preparation of lytic enzymes from bacillus subtilis sk-52 are presented. lysosubtilin was active against grampositive and gramnegative pathogenic bacteria. when it was used as a  substrate of live lyophilized microbial cells the highest lysis levels were observed in b. brevis, b. cereus, b. pumilis, b. subtilis and s. faecalis. preincubation of the substrate in acid media mainly increased the levels of the lysis by enzyme preparation. sometimes the increase was very high (b. sphaericus, b. subtilis 720, e. coli k12 and mre-600). such a preincubation provided cell lysis in some strains not liable to the effect of lysosubtilin (b. cereus 1312, c. renale, m. luteus, s. aureus kp, 800, 805 and 126001, s. pyogenes 291). an increase in the lysosubtilin concentration in the reaction mixture in the majority of the cases did not provide favourable results. however, some strains resistant to the preparation at a concentration of 1000 units/ml were lysed with  its 10 times higher doses. an increase in the lysis level was also achieved with  increasing the time of the incubation with the enzyme preparation. proceeding from the preparation antibacterial spectrum it is possible to recommend it for treatment of diseases in agricultural animals. its use in veterinary was a success.

TI  == [effect of metabolites on the human plasma concentration as total activity after  oral administration of rokitamycin. comparison of three different bioassay methods].
AB  == three different bioassay methods for rokitamycin (tms-19-q) were compared to each other in vitro and in vivo. method i was a paper disc method using micrococcus luteus atcc 9341 as the test organism in nutrient agar (ph 8.0), method ii was a  paper disc method using streptococcus pyogenes cook in brain heart infusion agar  (ph 7.4) and method iii was an agar well method using m. luteus atcc 9341 in the  agar medium provided in the minimum requirements for antibiotic products of japan (ph 6.5). ratios of relative potency of tms-19-q and its metabolites calculated from standard curves in human plasma using these bioassay methods, were 1.00:1.13:3.34:0.96 (tms-19-q:10"-oh-tms-19-q:lm a7:lm v) in method i, 1.00:1.58:0.40 (tms-19-q:lm a7:lm v) in method ii and 1.00:0.51:0.86:0.114 (tms-19-q:10"-oh-tms-19-q:lm a7:lm v) in method iii. the relative potency obtained from method i, generally used for macrolide antibiotics, greatly contradicted mic values of tms-19-q and its metabolites against clinically isolated 190 strains of staphylococcus aureus. on the other hand, the relative potency obtained from method iii reflected closely mic values of tms-19-q and its metabolites. therefore, method iii should be the most suitable bioassay method to measure the plasma concentration of tms-19-q. plasma concentrations measured by these 3 different methods were compared to each other in vivo, after oral administration of tms-19-q at a dose of 1,200 mg to each of fasted healthy volunteers. values obtained from method i were about 4.3 times higher than those  method iii.(abstract truncated at 250 words)
