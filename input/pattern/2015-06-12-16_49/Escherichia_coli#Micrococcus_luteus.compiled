TI  - Critical roles of sea cucumber C-type lectin in non-self recognition and bacterial clearance.
AB  - C-type lectin is one important pattern recognition receptor (PRR) that plays crucial roles in multiple immune responses. A C-type lectin from sea cucumber Apostichopus japonicus (AjCTL-1) was characterized in the present study. The amino acid sequence of AjCTL-1 shared high similarities with other C-type lectins from invertebrates and vertebrates. The C-type lectin domain (CTLD) of AjCTL-1 contained a Ca2+-binding site 2 and four conserved cysteine residues. AjCTL-1 mRNA expression patterns in tissues and after bacterial challenge were then analyzed. Quantitative PCR revealed that AjCTL-1 mRNA was widely expressed in the tested tissues of healthy sea cucumber. The highest expression level occurred in gonad followed by body wall, coelomocytes, tentacle, intestinum and longitudinal muscle, and the lowest expression level was in respiratory tree. AjCTL-1 mRNA expression in coelomocytes was significantly induced by gram-negative Listonella anguillarum and gram-positive Micrococcus luteus, with different up-regulation patterns post-challenge. Recombinant AjCTL-1 exhibited the ability to bind peptidoglycan directly, agglutinate M. luteus, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli, in a Ca2+-dependant manner, and enhance the phagocytosis of coelomocytes against E. coli in vitro. The results indicated that AjCTL-1 could act as a PRR in A. japonicas and had critical roles in non-self recognition and bacterial clearance against invading microbes.
TI  - Antimicrobial, antitumor and brine shrimp lethality assay of Ranunculus arvensis  L. extracts.
AB  - To investigate the antitumor activity, brine shrimp lethality assay, antibacterial and antifungal activity of Methanol Extract (ME), Water Extract (WE), Acetone Extract (AE), Chloroform Extract (CE), Methanol-Water Extract (MWE), Methanol-Acetone Extract (MAE), Methanol-Chloroform Extract (MCE) of Ranunculus arvensis (L.). Antitumor activity was evaluated with Agrobacterium tumefaciens (At10) induced potato disc assay. Cytotoxicity was evaluated with brine shrimp lethality assay. Antibacterial activity was evaluated with six bacterial strains including Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Bordetella bronchiseptica, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Micrococcus luteus and Streptococcus anginosus and antifungal screening was done against five fungal strains including Aspergillus niger, A. flavus, A. fumigates, Fusarium solani and Mucor species by using disc diffusion method. Best antitumor activity was obtained with ME and WE, having highest IC50 values 20.27 +/- 1.62 and 93.01 +/- 1.33mug/disc. Brine shrimp lethality assay showed LC50 values of AE, MAE and ME were obtained as 384.66 +/- 9.42mug/ml, 724.11 +/- 8.01mug/ml and 978.7 +/-8.01 mug/ml respectively. WE of R. arvensis revealed weak antimicrobial result against the tested microorganisms. On the other hand, the antifungal activity of the plant extracts was found to be insignificant. These findings demonstrate that extracts of R. arvensis possesses significant antitumor activity. Further extensive study is necessary to assess the therapeutic potential of the plant.
TI  - A novel integrin function in innate immunity from Chinese mitten crab (Eriocheir  sinensis).
AB  - Integrins belong to a superfamily of conserved alpha beta heterodimeric cell surface receptors that have critical function in cell migration, differentiation, and survival. In this study, an integrin called EsIntegrin was identified from Chinese mitten crab Eriocheir sinensis. EsIntegrin cDNA is 4415 bp long with a 2457 bp open reading frame that encodes an 818 amino acid protein. EsIntegrin contains a signal peptide, an integrin beta subunit (N-terminal portion of extracellular region) INB domain, an epidermal growth factor (hEGF) domain, an integrin B tail domain, a transmembrane region, and an integrin b cyt domain. EsIntegrin was mainly expressed in hemocytes and the heart, with a relatively lower expression level in gills, nerves, intestine, hepatopancreas, muscles, and eyestalk. When healthy crabs were challenged with LPS, PGN, Staphyloccocus aureus, or Vibrio parahaemolyticus, EsIntegrin expression level was upregulated significantly. Recombinant EsIntegrin has agglutination activity to Gram-positive (e.g., S. aureus and Bacillus subtilis) and Gram-negative bacteria (e.g., V. parahaemolyticus and Aeromonas hydrophila) in the presence of calcium. Furthermore, rEsIntegrin could not only bind to various bacteria such as S. aureus, Micrococcus luteus, B. subtilis, Bacillus megaterium, Bacillus thuringiensis, V. parahaemolyticus, Vibrio anguillarum, A. hydrophila, Vibrio natriegens, and Escherichia coli, but this compound also helped crabs in clearing virulent Gram-negative bacterium, V. parahaemolyticus, in vivo. These data suggested that EsIntegrin might function as cellular receptor that is involved in anti-bacterial immunity from E. sinensis.
TI  - Identification and antimicrobial activity detection of lactic Acid bacteria isolated from corn stover silage.
AB  - A total of 59 lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains were isolated from corn stover silage. According to phenotypic and chemotaxonomic characteristics, 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) sequences and recA gene polymerase chain reaction amplification, these LAB isolates were identified as five species: Lactobacillus (L.) plantarum subsp. plantarum, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Enterococcus mundtii, Weissella cibaria and Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, respectively. Those strains were also screened for antimicrobial activity using a dual-culture agar plate assay. Based on excluding the effects of organic acids and hydrogen peroxide, two L. plantarum subsp. plantarum strains ZZU 203 and 204, which strongly inhibited Salmonella enterica ATCC 43971(T), Micrococcus luteus ATCC 4698(T) and Escherichia coli ATCC 11775(T) were selected for further research on sensitivity of the antimicrobial substance to heat, pH and protease. Cell-free culture supernatants of the two strains exhibited strong heat stability (60 min at 100 degrees C), but the antimicrobial activity was eliminated after treatment at 121 degrees C for 15 min. The antimicrobial substance remained active under acidic condition (pH 2.0 to 6.0), but became inactive under neutral and alkaline condition (pH 7.0 to 9.0). In addition, the antimicrobial activities of these two strains decreased remarkably after digestion by protease K. These results preliminarily suggest that the desirable antimicrobial activity of strains ZZU 203 and 204 is the result of the production of a bacteriocin-like substance, and these two strains with antimicrobial activity could be used as silage additives to inhibit proliferation of unwanted microorganism during ensiling and preserve nutrients of silage. The nature of the antimicrobial substances is being investigated in our laboratory.
TI  - Development of an orthogonal fatty acid biosynthesis system in E. coli for oleochemical production.
AB  - Here we report recombinant expression and activity of several type I fatty acid synthases that can function in parallel with the native Escherichia coli fatty acid synthase. Corynebacterium glutamicum FAS1A was the most active in E. coli and this fatty acid synthase was leveraged to produce oleochemicals including fatty alcohols and methyl ketones. Coexpression of FAS1A with the ACP/CoA-reductase Maqu2220 from Marinobacter aquaeolei shifted the chain length distribution of fatty alcohols produced. Coexpression of FAS1A with FadM, FadB, and an acyl-CoA-oxidase from Micrococcus luteus resulted in the production of methyl ketones, although at a lower level than cells using the native FAS. This work, to our knowledge, is the first example of in vivo function of a heterologous fatty acid synthase in E. coli. Using FAS1 enzymes for oleochemical production have several potential advantages, and further optimization of this system could lead to strains with more efficient conversion to desired products. Finally, functional expression of these large enzyme complexes in E. coli will enable their study without culturing the native organisms.
TI  - Functional gene-based discovery of phenazines from the actinobacteria associated  with marine sponges in the South China Sea.
AB  - Phenazines represent a large group of nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compounds  produced by the diverse group of bacteria including actinobacteria. In this study, a total of 197 actinobacterial strains were isolated from seven different marine sponge species in the South China Sea using five different culture media. Eighty-seven morphologically different actinobacterial strains were selected and grouped into 13 genera, including Actinoalloteichus, Kocuria, Micrococcus, Micromonospora, Mycobacterium, Nocardiopsis, Prauserella, Rhodococcus, Saccharopolyspora, Salinispora, Serinicoccus, and Streptomyces by the phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA gene. Based on the screening of phzE genes, ten strains, including five Streptomyces, two Nocardiopsis, one Salinispora, one Micrococcus, and one Serinicoccus were found to be potential for phenazine production. The level of phzE gene expression was highly expressed in Nocardiopsis sp. 13-33-15, 13-12-13, and Serinicoccus sp. 13-12-4 on the fifth day of fermentation. Finally, 1,6-dihydroxy phenazine (1) from Nocardiopsis sp. 13-33-15 and 13-12-13, and 1,6-dimethoxy phenazine (2) from Nocardiopsis sp. 13-33-15 were isolated and identified successfully based on ESI-MS and NMR analysis. The compounds 1 and 2 showed antibacterial activity against Bacillus mycoides SJ14, Staphylococcus aureus SJ51, Escherichia coli SJ42, and Micrococcus luteus SJ47. This study suggests that the integrated approach of gene screening and chemical analysis is an effective strategy to find the target compounds and lays the basis for the production of phenazine from the sponge-associated actinobacteria.
TI  - Peroxiredoxin 1 protects the pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum from oxidative stress  induced by Micrococcus luteus infection.
AB  - Reactive oxygen species (ROSs) are generated in organisms in response to infections caused by invading microbes. However, excessive ROSs will inflict oxidative damage on the host. Peroxiredoxins (Prxs) are antioxidative enzymes that may eliminate ROSs efficiently. In this study, ApPrx1 from the pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum was cloned, and its function was investigated in vitro and in vivo. In the presence of DTT, recombinant ApPrx1 protein from Escherichia coli showed antioxidative activity by eliminating H2O2 effectively. The H2O2 levels were significantly higher in Micrococcus luteus-infected aphids than in uninfected aphids, and ApPrx1 expression was remarkably up-regulated when the aphids were infected with M. luteus or injected with H2O2. When ApPrx1 expression was reduced by dsRNA injection, the survival of the aphids decreased significantly after M. luteus infection. Knockdown of ApPrx1 decreased M. luteus loads inside the aphids 48h post-infection. While under infection conditions, the H2O2 levels were much higher in ApPrx1 knockdown aphids than in dsGFP-injected aphids, indicating that the decreased survival of the aphids was caused by increased oxidative stress. Taken together, our results reveal that ApPrx1 plays a protective role in oxidative stress caused by bacterial infection.
TI  - The extract of Hypericum ascyron L. induces bacterial cell death through apoptosis pathway.
AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Hypericum ascyron L. (H. ascyron L.) has been used as a traditional medicine for the treatment of wounds, swelling, headache, nausea, stomach ache, abscesses, dysentery and chronic bronchitis. Pharmacological studies are necessary to provide a scientific basis to substantiate their traditional use. In this study, antimicrobial effect and its mechanism of the H. ascyron L. extract was investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Antimicrobial activity of the H. ascyron L. extract was evaluated by the 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay (MTT). To confirm the antimicrobial mechanism of H. ascyron L. extract on bacterial cells, Annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) double staining, TUNEL, and DNA laddering analysis were performed. RESULTS: Antibacterial effects of the H. ascyron L. extract were tested on Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumonia, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Micrococcus luteus, and the results showed that the sensitive bacteria of H. ascyron L. extract mainly included E. coli, S. aureus and M. luteus, especially M. luteus. The MBC value of H. ascyron L. extract on M. luteus was equal to the MIC (20mg/mL). H. ascyron L. extract could induce cells death of M. luteus through apoptosis pathway. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides scientific support for some of the traditional uses and the pharmacological activities of H. ascyron L. Our data provide a rational base for the folkloric use of H. ascyron L.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of selected medicinal plants from lower Himalayas.
AB  - The present studies cover antibacterial activity of the crude methanolic extracts of 11 medicinal plants viz. Adhatoda vasica, Bauhenia variegate, Bombax ceiba, Carrisa opaca, Caryopteris grata, Debregeasia salicifolia, Lantana camara, Melia azedarach, Phyllanthus emblica, Pinus roxburghii and Olea ferruginea collected from lower Himalayas against two Gram positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Micrococcus luteus) and two Gram negative (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aureginosa) bacterial strains. The extracts were applied at four different concentrations (120 mg/mL, 90mg/mL, 60mg/mL and 30mg/mL) in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) by using agar well diffusion method. Antibacterial activities against Staphylococcus aureus and Micrococcus luteus were observed formethanolic extracts of all the above mentioned plants. Greater antibacterial activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was only exhibited by Phyllanthus emblica, Pinus roxburghii, Debregeasia salicifolia and Lantana camara. Escherichia coli was highly resistant to all the plant extracts at all concentrations. It is inferred that methanolic crude extracts of the above mentioned plantsexhibitantibacterial activities against pathogenic bacteria, which proved the ethnobotanical importance of the selected plants that indigenous people use for cure against various diseases.
TI  - Serpin-15 from Bombyx mori inhibits prophenoloxidase activation and expression of antimicrobial peptides.
AB  - Serine protease inhibitors (SPIs) play a key role in physiological responses by controlling protease activities. In this study, we studied the biochemical functions of serpin-15, an SPI, from Bombyx mori (Bmserpin-15). Recombinant Bmserpin-15 was expressed in Escherichia coli cells and used to raise rabbit anti-Bmserpin-15 polyclonal antibodies. Bmserpin-15 mRNA and protein expression was detected in all tested tissues, particularly in the fat body and silk gland. After challenge with four different microorganisms (Escherichia coli, Beauveria bassiana, Micrococcus luteus and B. mori nuclear polyhedrosis virus), the expressions of Bmserpin-15 mRNA and protein were induced significantly, particularly by B. bassiana and M. luteus. Recombinant Bmserpin-15 inhibited prophenoloxidase activation, but did not affect phenoloxidase activity, in B. mori hemolymph. Injection of recombinant Bmserpin-15 into B. mori larvae reduced significantly the transcript levels of antimicrobial peptides in fat body. Our results suggested that Bmserpin-15 plays an important role in the innate immunity of B. mori.
TI  - One-pot multi-component synthesis of 1,4-dihydropyridines using Zn(2+) @KSF and evaluating their antibacterial and antioxidant activities.
AB  - New 5-aryl-10-(4-(4-methoxyphenyl)thiazole-2-yl)-9,10-dihydropyrido[2,3-d:5,6-d']dipy rimidinone-2,4,6,8-(1H,3H,5H,7H)-tetraones 6a-d were synthesized through one-pot four-component reaction of aldehydes, barbituric acid, and thiazole using Zn(2+) @KSF under reflux condition. The key features of this reaction are: incorporating four heterocyclic rings, using a heterogeneous and efficient catalyst, high yield, and easy-to-setup reaction. The structure of the products was confirmed by FT-IR, (1)H NMR, and (13)C NMR spectra. The antibacterial activities of compounds 6a-d were screened against Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus bacterial strains using the zone inhibition method. Also, the 2,2-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activities of compounds 6a-d were evaluated. All compounds showed good antioxidant capacity in comparison to ascorbic acid. The IC50 values of the antioxidant activity were calculated. The proposed mechanism for antioxidant activity is discussed.
TI  - Myceligenerans cantabricum sp. nov., a barotolerant actinobacterium isolated from a deep cold-water coral.
AB  - An actinobacterium strain (M-201(T)) was isolated from a deep-sea scleractinian coral (Fam. Caryophillidae) collected at 1500 m depth in the Aviles Canyon in the Cantabrian Sea, Asturias, Spain. Strain M-201(T) grew at pH 6.0-9.0 (optimum pH 7.0), between 4 and 37 degrees C (optimum 28 degrees C) and at salinities of 0.5-10.5 % (w/v) NaCl (optimum 0.5-3.0 %). The peptidoglycan contained the amino acids Lys, Ala, Thr, Glu and one unknown amino acid component, and belonged to type A4alpha, and the cell-wall sugars are glucose, mannose and galactose. The polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol, an unknown phosphoglycolipid and seven unknown glycolipids. The predominant menaquinones were MK-9(H4) and MK-9(H6). Major cellular fatty acids were anteiso-C15 : 0, iso-C15 : 0 and anteiso-C17 : 0. The genomic DNA G+C content was 72.4 mol%. The chemotaxonomic properties supported the affiliation of strain M-201(T) to the genus Myceligenerans . Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that the organism was most closely related to Myceligenerans crystallogenes CD12E2-27(T) (98.2 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity). However, it had a relatively low DNA-DNA relatedness value with the above strain (48 %). The isolate showed antibiotic activity against Escherichia coli , Micrococcus luteus ATCC 14452 and Saccharomyces cerevisiae var. carlsbergensis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of antibiotic production in the genus Myceligenerans . The differences in phenotypic, metabolic, ecological and phylogenetic characteristics justify the proposal of a novel species of the genus Myceligenerans , Myceligenerans cantabricum sp. nov., with M-201(T) ( = CECT 8512(T) = DSM 28392(T)) as the type strain.
TI  - Antimicrobial peptides expressed in medicinal maggots of the blow fly Lucilia sericata show combinatorial activity against bacteria.
AB  - The larvae of the common green bottle fly (Lucilia sericata) produce antibacterial secretions that have a therapeutic effect on chronic and nonhealing wounds. Recent developments in insect biotechnology have made it possible to use these larvae as a source of novel anti-infectives. Here, we report the application of next-generation RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) to characterize the transcriptomes of the larval glands, crop, and gut, which contribute to the synthesis of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and proteins secreted into wounds. Our data confirm that L. sericata larvae have adapted in order to colonize microbially contaminated habitats, such as carrion and necrotic wounds, and are protected against infection by a diverse spectrum of AMPs. L. sericata AMPs include not only lucifensin and lucimycin but also novel attacins, cecropins, diptericins, proline-rich peptides, and sarcotoxins. We identified 47 genes encoding putative AMPs and produced 23 as synthetic analogs, among which some displayed activities against a broad spectrum of microbial pathogens, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus vulgaris, and Enterococcus faecalis. Against Escherichia coli (Gram negative) and Micrococcus luteus (Gram positive), we found mostly additive effects but also synergistic activity when selected AMPs were tested in combination. The AMPs that are easy to synthesize are currently being produced in bulk to allow their evaluation as novel anti-infectives that can be formulated in hydrogels to produce therapeutic wound dressings and adhesive bandages.
TI  - Enzyme fusion for whole-cell biotransformation of long-chain sec-alcohols into esters.
AB  - Enzyme fusion was investigated as a strategy to improve productivity of a two-step whole-cell biocatalysis. The biotransformation of long-chain sec-alcohols into esters by an alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenases (BVMOs) was used as the model reaction. The recombinant Escherichia coli, expressing the fusion enzymes between the ADH of Micrococcus luteus NCTC2665 and the BVMO of Pseudomonas putida KT2440 or Rhodococcus jostii RHA1, showed significantly greater bioconversion activity with long-chain sec-alcohols (e.g., 12-hydroxyoctadec-9-enoic acid (1a), 13-hydroxyoctadec-9-enoic acid (2a), 14-hydroxyicos-11-enoic acid (4a)) when compared to the recombinant E. coli expressing the ADH and BVMOs independently. For instance, activity of the recombinant E. coli expressing the ADH-Gly-BVMO, in which glycine-rich peptide was used as the linker, with 1a was increased up to 22 mumol g dry cells-1 min-1. This value is over 40 % greater than the recombinant E. coli expressing the ADH and BVMO independently. The substantial improvement appeared to be driven by an increase in the functional expression of the BVMOs and/or an increase in mass transport efficiency by localizing two active sites in close proximity.
TI  - Prenylated benzophenones from Triadenum japonicum.
AB  - Six new prenylated benzophenones, (-)-nemorosonol (1) and trijapins A-E (2-6), were isolated from the aerial parts of Triadenum japonicum. (-)-Nemorosonol (1) and trijapins A-C (2-4) have a common tricyclo[4.3.1.0(3,7)]decane skeleton, while 1 is an enantiomer of (+)-nemorosonol previously isolated from Clusia nemorosa. The absolute configuration of (-)-nemorosonol (1) was assigned by ECD spectroscopy. Trijapins A-C (2-4) are analogues of 1 possessing an additional tetrahydrofuran ring. Trijapins D (5) and E (6) are prenylated benzophenones with a 1,2-dioxane moiety and a hydroperoxy group, respectively. (-)-Nemorosonol (1) exhibited antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli (MIC, 8 mug/mL), Staphylococcus aureus (MIC, 16 mug/mL), Bacillus subtilis (MIC, 16 mug/mL), Micrococcus luteus (MIC, 32 mug/mL), Aspergillus niger (IC50, 16 mug/mL), Trichophyton mentagrophytes (IC50, 8 mug/mL), and Candida albicans (IC50, 32 mug/mL), while trijapin D (5) showed antimicrobial activity against C. albicans (IC50, 8 mug/mL).
TI  - Functional implications of the peptidoglycan recognition proteins in the immunity of the yellow fever mosquito, Aedes aegypti.
AB  - Peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRPs) play essential roles in the immune systems of insects and higher animals against certain pathogens, including bacteria. In insects, most studies on the functions of PGRPs have been performed in Drosophila, with only limited studies in mosquitoes, which are important disease vectors. In the present study, we analysed the PGRP sequences of the yellow fever mosquito, Aedes aegypti, acquired from two genome databases, and identified a total of seven PGRP genes; namely, PGRP-S1, -SC2, -LA, -LB, -LC, -LD and -LE. Bacterial injection using the Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli and the Gram-positive bacteria Micrococcus luteus showed that three PGRPs responded directly to both bacterial stimuli. Subsequently, the transcriptional expression of six of these PGRPs was knocked down using double-stranded RNA-injection-based RNA interference (RNAi). RNAi of the PGRPs resulted in different impacts on the immune responses of Ae. aegypti to the two bacteria, as evidenced by the changes in mosquito survival rates after bacterial challenges as well as the differential regulation of several antimicrobial peptides and a number of other genes involved in mosquito immune pathways. Our data suggest that PGRP-LC is a significant factor in mediating immune responses to both E. coli and M. luteus, and the other PGRPs play only minor roles against these two bacteria, with PGRP-SC2 and -LB also serving as potential negative regulators for certain immune pathway(s) in Ae. aegypti.
TI  - Different forms of apolipophorin III in Galleria mellonella larvae challenged with bacteria and fungi.
AB  - Apolipophorin III (apoLp-III), a lipid-binding protein and an insect homolog of human apolipoprotein E, plays an important role in lipid transport and immune response in insects. In the present study, we have demonstrated a correlation in time between changes in the apoLp-III abundance occurring in the hemolymph, hemocytes, and fat body after immunization of Galleria mellonella larvae with Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli, Gram-positive bacteria Micrococcus luteus, yeast Candida albicans, and a filamentous fungus Fusarium oxysporum. Using two-dimensional electrophoresis (IEF/SDS-PAGE) and immunoblotting with anti-apoLp-III antibodies, the profile of apoLp-III forms in G. mellonella larvae challenged with the bacteria and fungi has been analyzed. Besides the major apoLp-III protein (pI=6.5), one and three additional apoLp-III forms differing in the pI value have been detected, respectively, in the hemolymph, hemocytes, and fat body of non-immunized insects. Also, evidence has been provided that particular apoLp-III-derived polypeptides appear after the immune challenge and are present mainly in the hemolymph and hemocytes. The time of their appearance and persistence in the hemolymph was dependent on the pathogen used. At least two of the apoLp-III forms detected in hemolymph bound to the microbial cell surface. The increasing number of hemolymph apoLp-III polypeptides and differences in their profiles observed in time after the challenge with different immunogens confirmed the important role of apoLp-III in discriminating between pathogens by the insect defense system and in antibacterial as well as antifungal immune response.
TI  - Expression levels of chaperones influence biotransformation activity of recombinant Escherichia coli expressing Micrococcus luteus alcohol dehydrogenase and Pseudomonas putida Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenase.
AB  - We demonstrated for the first time that the archaeal chaperones (i.e., gamma-prefoldin and thermosome) can stabilize enzyme activity in vivo. Ricinoleic acid biotransformation activity of recombinant Escherichia coli expressing Micrococcus luteus alcohol dehydrogenase and the Pseudomonas putida KT2440 Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenase improved significantly with co-expression of gamma-prefoldin or recombinant themosome originating from the deep-sea hyperthermophile archaea Methanocaldococcus jannaschii. Furthermore, the degree of enhanced activity was dependent on the expression levels of the chaperones. For example, whole-cell biotransformation activity was highest at 12 micromol/g dry cells/min when gamma-prefoldin expression level was approximately 46% of the theoretical maximum. This value was approximately two-fold greater than that in E. coli, where the gamma-prefoldin expression level was zero or set to the theoretical maximum. Therefore, it was assumed that the expression levels of chaperones must be optimized to achieve maximum biotransformation activity in whole-cell biocatalysts.
TI  - Improved antimicrobial activities of synthetic-hybrid bacteriocins designed from  enterocin E50-52 and pediocin PA-1.
AB  - Two hybrid bacteriocins, enterocin E50-52/pediocin PA-1 (EP) and pediocin PA-1/enterocin E50-52 (PE), were designed by combining the N terminus of enterocin E50-52 and the C terminus of pediocin PA-1 and by combining the C terminus of pediocin PA-1 and the N terminus of enterocin E50-52, respectively. Both hybrid bacteriocins showed reduced MICs compared to those of their natural counterparts. The MICs of hybrid PE and EP were 64- and 32-fold lower, respectively, than the MIC of pediocin PA-1 and 8- and 4-fold lower, respectively, than the MIC of enterocin E50-52. In this study, the effect of hybrid as well as wild-type (WT) bacteriocins on the transmembrane electrical potential (DeltaPsi) and their ability to induce the efflux of intracellular ATP were investigated. Enterocin E50-52, pediocin PA-1, and hybrid bacteriocin PE were able to dissipate DeltaPsi, but EP was unable to deplete this component. Both hybrid bacteriocins caused a loss of the intracellular concentration of ATP. EP, however, caused a faster efflux than PE and enterocin E50-52. Enterocin E50-52 and hybrids PE and EP were active against the Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria tested, such as Micrococcus luteus, Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis 20E1090, and Escherichia coli O157:H7. The hybrid bacteriocins designed and described herein are antimicrobial peptides with MICs lower those of their natural counterparts. Both hybrid peptides induce the loss of intracellular ATP and are capable of inhibiting Gram-negative bacteria, and PE dissipates the electrical potential. In this study, the MIC of hybrid bacteriocin PE decreased 64-fold compared to the MIC of its natural peptide counterpart, pediocin PA-1. Inhibition of Gram-negative pathogens confers an additional advantage for the application of these peptides in therapeutics.
TI  - Isolation and identification of symbiotic bacteria from the skin, mouth, and rectum of wild and captive tree shrews.
AB  - Endosymbionts influence many aspects of their hosts' health conditions, including physiology, development, immunity, metabolism, etc. Tree shrews (Tupaia belangeri chinensis) have attracted increasing attention in modeling human diseases and therapeutic responses due to their close relationship with primates. To clarify the situation of symbiotic bacteria from their body surface, oral cavity, and anus, 12 wild and 12 the third generation of captive tree shrews were examined. Based on morphological and cultural characteristics, physiological and biochemical tests, as well as the 16S rDNA full sequence analysis, 12 bacteria strains were isolated and identified from the wild tree shrews: body surface: Bacillus subtilis (detection rate 42%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (25%), Staphlococcus aureus (33%), S. Epidermidis (75%), Micrococcus luteus (25%), Kurthia gibsonii (17%); oral cavity: Neisseria mucosa (58%), Streptococcus pneumonia (17%); anus: Enterococcus faecalis (17%), Lactococus lactis (33%), Escherichia coli (92%), Salmonella typhosa (17%); whereas, four were indentified from the third generation captive tree shrews: body surface: S. epidermidis (75%); oral cavity: N.mucosa (67%); anus: L. lactis (33%), E. coli (100%). These results indicate that S. epidermidis, N. mucosa, L. lactis and E. coli were major bacteria in tree shrews, whereas, S. aureus, M. luteus, K. gibsonii, E. faecalis and S. typhosa were species-specific flora. This study facilitates the future use of tree shrews as a standard experimental animal and improves our understanding of the relationship between endosymbionts and their hosts.
TI  - Synthesis, characterization and biological activity of new mixed ligand complexes of Zn(II) naproxen with nitrogen based ligands.
AB  - A series of novel Zn(II) complexes [Zn2(nap)4] (1), [Zn(nap)21,10-phen](2), [Zn(nap)22,9-dmphen] (3), [Zn(nap)2(2-ampy)2] (4), [Zn(nap)2(imid)2] (5), [Zn(nap)2(1,2-dmimid)2] (6) (nap = naproxen, 1,10-phen = 1,10-phenanthroline, 2,9-dmphen = 2,9-dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroline, 2-ampy = 2-aminopyridine, imid = imidazole, 1,2-dmimid = 1,2-dimethyl imidazole) were synthesized and characterized using IR, UV-Vis, (1)H NMR, (13)C{(1)H} NMR spectroscopy. The crystal structure of complex 3 was determined using single-crystal X-ray diffraction. In order to assess the effect of the metal ions on the anti-bacterial activity, complexes 1-6 have been screened in vitro, against (G(+)) bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Micrococcus luteus) and (G(-)) bacteria (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli) using the agar well diffusion method. Complex 2 was the only complex that showed antibacterial activity against P. aeruginosa, where the complexation of the parent ligand 1,10-phenathroline enhanced significantly the activity. All the complexes showed different activity against the different bacteria, and were compared with activity of the parent ligands. The complexes were tested also for their anti-malarial activity using two methods: a semi-quantitative micro-assay and a previously self-developed quantitative in-vitro method. Both were used to study the efficiency of these complexes in inhibiting the formation of the Malaria pigment. This is considered an important target of many known anti-malarial drugs such as Chloroquine and Amodaquine. Results showed that the efficiency of complex 3 in preventing the formation of beta-hematin was 75%. The efficiency of Amodiaquine as a standard drug was reported to give 92.5.
TI  - Involvement of a Serpin serine protease inhibitor (OoSerpin) from mollusc Octopus ocellatus in antibacterial response.
AB  - Serpin is an important member of serine protease inhibitors (SPIs), which is capable of regulating proteolytic events and involving in a variety of physiological processes. In present study, a Serpin homolog was identified from Octopus ocellatus (designated as OoSerpin). Full-length cDNA of OoSerpin was of 1735 bp, containing a 5' untranslated region of 214 bp, a 3' UTR of 282 bp, and an open reading frame of 1239 bp. The open reading frame encoded a polypeptide of 412 amino acids which has a predicted molecular weight of 46.5 kDa and an isoelectric point of 8.52. The OoSerpin protein shares 37% sequence identity with other Serpins from Mus musculus (NP_941373) and Ixodes scapularis (XP_002407493). The existence of a conserved SERPIN domain strongly suggested that OoSerpin was a member of the Serpin subfamily. Expression patterns of OoSerpin, both in tissues and towards bacterial stimulation, were then characterized. The mRNA of OoSerpin was constitutively expressed at different levels in all tested tissues of untreated O. ocellatus, including mantle (lowest), muscle, renal sac, gill, hemocyte, gonad, systemic heart, and hepatopancreas (highest). The transcriptional level of OoSerpin was significantly up-regulated (P<0.01) in O. ocellatus upon bacterial challenges with Vibrio anguillarum and Micrococcus luteus, indicating its involvement in the antibacterial immune response. Furthermore, rOoSerpin, the recombinant protein of OoSerpin, exhibited strong abilities to inhibit proteinase activities of trypsin and chymotrypsin as well as the growth of Escherichia coli. Our results demonstrate that OoSerpin is a potential antibacterial factor involved in the immune response of O. ocellatus against bacterial infection.
TI  - Antibiotic oxylipins from Alternanthera brasiliana and its endophytic bacteria.
AB  - Bioassay-guided fractionation of Alternanthera brasiliana stem extracts resulted  in the isolation of an antibiotically active fraction. Five human pathogenic bacteria were used to guide the fractionation process for the isolation of antimicrobial compounds. Finally, 17 linoleate oxylipins were identified by LC-MS/MS and NMR spectroscopy. Five of the isolated compounds present in A. brasiliana tissues were also detected to be synthesized by endophytic bacteria of the genus Bacillus that were isolated from A. brasiliana. It is speculated that the antibiotic oxylipins from A. brasiliana might derive from bacteria and be involved in an ecological relationship between this plant and its endophytes.
TI  - Molecular identification of two prophenoloxidase-activating proteases from the hemocytes of Plutella xylostella (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae) and their transcript abundance changes in response to microbial challenges.
AB  - The phenoloxidase (PO) activation system plays an important role in insect innate immunity, particularly in wound healing and pathogen defense. A key member of this system is prophenoloxidase-activating protease (PAP), which is the direct activator of prophenoloxidase (proPO). Despite their importance in the insect PO activation system, content of studies is limited. In this article, we identify two complementary DNAs (cDNAs), PxPAPa and PxPAPb, encoding possible PAPs, from immunized larval hemocytes of the diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella (L.), by RACE method. PxPAPa is 1,149-bp long and encodes a 382-residue open reading frame (ORF) with a predicted 17-residue signal peptide, a clip domain, and a Tryp_Spc domain. PxPAPb is 1,650-bp long and encodes a 440-residue ORF with a predicted 20-residue signal peptide, two clip domains, and a Tryp_Spc domain. PxPAPa and PxPAPb have a high sequence similarity to Manduca sexta (L.) PAP1 and PAP3, respectively. We also examined the transcript patterns of PxPAPa, PxPAPb, and pxPAP3, another clip-domain serine protease gene, response to different microbial challenges by using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The results show that the transcript abundance of PxPAPa is significantly increased by Micrococcus luteus and Escherichia coli but not Candida albicans. PxPAPb is induced only by Mi. luteus, whereas pxPAP3 could be induced by all the microbes in the test, but the transcript patterns of Mi. luteus, E. coli, and C. albicans are completely different. This study provides new insights into the molecular events that occur during the immune response, particularly melanization cascade that is involved in encapsulation and nodulation of pathogen or parasite invaders via hemocytes in host insects.
TI  - Synthesis of novel benzimidazole functionalized chiral thioureas and evaluation of their antibacterial and anticancer activities.
AB  - A small library of benzimidazole functionalized chiral thioureas was prepared starting from natural amino acids (S)-alanine, (S)-phenylalanine, (S)-valine and (S)-leucine and also their (R)-isomers and studied their antimicrobial activity against a various Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial strains. In this study, compounds 5g and 5j were found to exhibit good antibacterial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial strains such as Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, Klebsiella planticola, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In the cytotoxicity study, thioureas derived from non-natural amino acids 5a-l showed good activity against human cancer cell lines A549, MCF7, DU145, HeLa, and no cytotoxicity was observed with their antipodes 6a-l.
TI  - Fabrication of SWCNT-Ag nanoparticle hybrid included self-assemblies for antibacterial applications.
AB  - The present article reports the development of soft nanohybrids comprising of single walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) included silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) having superior antibacterial property. In this regard aqueous dispersing agent of carbon nanotube (CNT) containing a silver ion reducing unit was synthesised by the inclusion of tryptophan and tyrosine within the backbone of the amphiphile. The dispersions were characterized spectroscopically and microscopically using TEM, AFM and Raman spectroscopy. The nanotube-nanoparticle conjugates were prepared by the in situ photoreduction of AgNO3. The phenolate residue and the indole moieties of tyrosine and tryptophan, respectively reduces the sliver ion as well as acts as stabilizing agents for the synthesized AgNPs. The nanohybrids were characterized using TEM and AFM. The antibacterial activity of the nanohybrids was studied against Gram-positive (Bacillus subtilis and Micrococcus luteus) and Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli and Klebsiella aerogenes). The SWCNT dispersions showed moderate killing ability (40-60%) against Gram-positive bacteria however no antibacterial activity was observed against the Gram negative ones. Interestingly, the developed SWCNT-amphiphile-AgNP nanohybrids exhibited significant killing ability ( approximately 90%) against all bacteria. Importantly, the cell viability of these newly developed self-assemblies was checked towards chinese hamster ovarian cells and high cell viability was observed after 24 h of incubation. This specific killing of bacterial cells may have been achieved due to the presence of higher -SH containing proteins in the cell walls of the bacteria. The developed nanohybrids were subsequently infused into tissue engineering scaffold agar-gelatin films and the films similarly showed bactericidal activity towards both kinds of bacterial strains while allowing normal growth of eukaryotic cells on the surface of the films.
TI  - Antibacterial potential of Calotropis procera (flower) extract against various pathogens.
AB  - Increased bacterial resistance towards commonly used antibiotics has become a debated issue all over the world in a last few decades. Due to this, consumer demand towards natural anti-microbial agents is increasing day by day. Natural anti-microbial agents have gained enormous attention as an alternative therapeutic agent in pharmaceutical industry. Current study is an effort to explore and identify a bactericidal potential of various solvent extracts of Calotropis procera flower. Flowers of C. procera were extracted with hexane, butanol, ethyl acetate and aqua to evaluate the antibacterial activity by agar well diffusion method against the various human pathogens. The microorganisms used in this study includes Salmonella typhi, Escherichia coli (O157:H7), Micrococcus luteus KIBGE-IB20 (Gen Bank accession: JQ250612) and methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) KIBGE-IB23 (Gen Bank accession: KC465400). Zones of inhibition were observed against all four pathogenic strains. Fraction soluble in hexane showed broad spectrum of inhibition against all the studied pathogens. However, fractions soluble in ethyl acetate inhibited the growth of E. coli, MRSA, and M. luteus. In case of butanol and aqueous extracts only growth of M. luteus was inhibited. Results revealed that the flower extracts of C. procera have a potential to be used as an antibacterial agent against these pathogenic organisms.
TI  - Antibacterial properties of silver nanoparticles synthesized using Pulicaria glutinosa plant extract as a green bioreductant.
AB  - The antibacterial properties of nanoparticles (NPs) can be significantly enhanced by increasing the wettability or solubility of NPs in aqueous medium. In this study, we investigated the effects of the stabilizing agent on the solubility of silver NPs and its subsequent effect on their antimicrobial activities. Silver NPs were prepared using an aqueous solution of Pulicaria glutinosa plant extract as bioreductant. The solution also acts as a capping ligand. During this study, the antimicrobial activities of silver NPs, as well as the plant extract alone, were tested against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Micrococcus luteus. Silver NPs were prepared with various concentrations of the plant extract to study its effect on antimicrobial activity. Interestingly, various concentrations of P. glutinosa extract did not show any effect on the growth of tested bacteria; however, a significant effect on the antimicrobial property of plant extract capped silver NPs (Ag-NPs-PE) was observed. For instance, the half maximal inhibitory concentration values were found to decrease (from 4% to 21%) with the increasing concentrations of plant extract used for the synthesis of Ag-NPs-PE. These results clearly indicate that the addition of P. glutinosa extracts enhances the solubility of Ag-NPs-PE and, hence, increases their toxicity against the tested microorganisms.
TI  - Inducible factors with antimicrobial activity after immune challenge in the haemolymph of Red Palm Weevil (Insecta).
AB  - Insects are capable of innate immune responses elicited after microbial infection. In this process, the receptor-mediated recognition of foreign bodies and the subsequent activation of immunocompetent cells lead to the synthesis ex novo of a peptide pool with antimicrobial activity. We investigated the inducible immune response of a coleopteran, Rhynchophorus ferrugineus, challenged with both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. After immunization, we evaluated the presence of antimicrobial peptides using either biochemical analyses or microbiological techniques. The antimicrobial properties of the newly synthesized protein pool, detectable in haemolymph fractions of low molecular mass, showed strong antibacterial activity against various bacterial strains (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas sp. OX1, Bacillus subtilis and Micrococcus luteus). In addition to the preliminary study of the mechanism of action of the pool of antimicrobial peptides, we also investigated its effects on bacterial cell walls by means of fluorescence microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The data suggest that the main effects seem to be directed at destabilizing and damaging the bacterial wall. This study provides data that help us to understand some aspects of the inducible innate immunity in a system model that lacks anticipatory responses. However, the weevil has finely tuned its defensive strategies to counteract effectively microbial infection.
TI  - Antibacterial tetraoxygenated xanthones from the immature fruits of Garcinia cowa.
AB  - A phytochemical investigation of the acetone extract from the immature fruits of  Garcinia cowa led to the isolation of two novel tetraoxygenated xanthones, garcicowanones A (1) and B (2), together with eight known tetraoxygeanted xanthones. Their structures were determined by spectroscopic analysis. All isolated compounds were evaluated for their antibacterial activity against Bacillus cereus TISTR 688, Bacillus subtilis TISTR 008, Micrococcus luteus TISTR 884, Staphylococcus aureus TISTR 1466, Escherichia coli TISTR 780, Pseudomonas aeruginosa TISTR 781, Salmonella typhimurium TISTR 292 and Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228. alpha-Mangostin showed potent activity (MIC 0.25-1 mug/mL) against three Gram-positive strains and garcicowanone A and beta-mangostin exhibited strong antibacterial activity against B. cereus with the same MIC values of 0.25 mug/mL.
TI  - Nitric oxide levels regulate the immune response of Drosophila melanogaster reference laboratory strains to bacterial infections.
AB  - Studies on the innate immune response against microbial infections in Drosophila  melanogaster involve mutant strains and their reference strains that act as experimental controls. We used five standard D. melanogaster laboratory reference strains (Oregon R, w1118, Canton-S, Cinnabar Brown, and Yellow White [YW]) and investigated their response against two pathogenic bacteria (Photorhabdus luminescens and Enterococcus faecalis) and two nonpathogenic bacteria (Escherichia coli and Micrococcus luteus). We detected high sensitivity among YW flies to bacterial infections and increased bacterial growth compared to the other strains. We also found variation in the transcription of certain antimicrobial peptide genes among strains, with Oregon and YW infected flies showing the highest and lowest gene transcription levels in most cases. We show that Oregon and w1118 flies possess more circulating hemocytes and higher levels of phenoloxidase activity than the other strains upon infection with the nonpathogenic bacteria. We further observed reduced fat accumulation in YW flies infected with the pathogenic bacteria, which suggests a possible decline in physiological condition. Finally, we found that nitrite levels are significantly lower in infected and uninfected YW flies compared to w1118 flies and that nitric oxide synthase mutant flies in YW background are more susceptible to bacterial infection compared to mutants in w1118 background. Therefore, increased sensitivity of YW flies to bacterial infections can be partly attributed to lower levels of nitric oxide. Such studies will significantly contribute toward a better understanding of the genetic variation between D. melanogaster reference strains.
TI  - Lysozyme and defense peptides as suppressors of phenoloxidase activity in Galleria mellonella.
AB  - The prophenoloxidase (proPO) cascade supplies quinones and other reactive compounds for melanin formation, protein cross-linking, hemolymph coagulation, and killing of microbial invaders as well as parasites. The high cytotoxicity of the generated compounds requires a strict control of the activation of the proPO system and phenoloxidase (PO) activity to minimize damage to host tissues and cells. The PO activity in hemolymph of Escherichia coli challenged Galleria mellonella larvae increased, with a temporal drop 1 h after the challenge, reaching the highest level 24 h after the challenge. In the present study, a potential role of G. mellonella defense peptides and lysozyme in controlling the proPO system was investigated. The effects of purified defense peptides (anionic peptides 1 and 2, cecropin D-like peptide, Galleria defensin, proline-rich peptides 1 and 2) and lysozyme were analyzed. Four compounds, namely lysozyme, Galleria defensin, proline-rich peptide 1, and anionic peptide 2, decreased the hemolymph PO activity considerably, whereas the others did not affect the enzyme activity level. Our results indicate that these hemolymph factors could play multiple and distinct roles in the insect immune response.
TI  - Type I and type II crustins from Penaeus monodon, genetic variation and antimicrobial activity of the most abundant crustinPm4.
AB  - An antimicrobial protein, crustin, is involved in the innate immunity of crustacean by defending the host directly against the microbial pathogens. By data mining the Penaeus monodon EST database, two type I crustins, carcininPm1 and 2, and ten type II crustins, crustinPm1-10, were identified. The abundant crustins were crustinPm1, 4 and 7, each with variation in the length of Gly-rich repeat among its members. A few crustinPm1, 4 and 7 with deletion in the Cys-rich region were also observed. Furthermore, the crustinPm4 with the longest N-terminal Gly-rich region was characterized. The crustinPm4 allelic genes were expressed mainly from the hemocytes. Its expression was up-regulated readily by WSSV infection and gradually decreased to normal level afterwards. The recombinant crustinPm4-1 (rcrustinPm4-1) isoform was produced using the Escherichia coli expression system and tested for its antimicrobial activity. The rcrustinPm4-1 was able to inhibit the growth of a Gram-positive bacterium, Bacillus megaterium but not Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus and Staphylococcus aureus. It also inhibited the growth of two Gram-negative bacteria, E. coli 363 and Vibrio harveyi 639 at lower potency. The rcrustinPm4-1 affected the WSSV infection because the expression of an intermediate early gene ie1 in WSSV-infected hemocyte cell culture was reduced. It was shown further that the rcrustinPm4-1 could delay by about one and a half days the manifestation of disease by WSSV.
TI  - Functions of Armigeres subalbatus C-type lectins in innate immunity.
AB  - C-type lectins (CTLs) are a superfamily of calcium-dependent carbohydrate binding proteins containing at least one carbohydrate-recognition domain (CRD) and they are present in almost all metazoans. Insect CTLs may function as pattern-recognition receptors and play important roles in innate immunity. In this study, we selected five AsCTLs from the mosquito Armigeres subalbatus, a natural vector of filarial nematodes, and performed both in vitro and in vivo studies to elucidate their functions in innate immunity. AsCTLMA15, AsCTLGA5 and AsCTL15 were mainly expressed in hemocytes, AsCTL16 was expressed in fat body, while AsCTLMA11 was expressed in both hemocytes and fat body, and only AsCTLMA11 and AsCTL16 were expressed at high levels in adult females. In vitro binding assays showed that all five recombinant AsCTLs could bind to different microbial cell wall components, including lipopolysaccharide (LPS), lipid A, peptidoglycan (PG), lipoteichoic acid (LTA), zymosan and laminarin (beta-1,3-glucan). Recombinant AsCTLs also bound to several Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, and could agglutinate bacterial cells. Injection of double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) could significantly reduce expression of the five AsCTL mRNAs, and the survival of mosquitoes treated with dsRNA to AsCTLGA5 was significantly decreased after Escherichia coli infection, but did not change significantly after Micrococcus luteus infection compared to the control groups, suggesting that Ar. subalbatus AsCTLGA5 may participate in innate immunity against E. coli.
TI  - The effects of dietary vitamin C on mucosal immune responses and growth performance in Caspian roach (Rutilus rutilus caspicus) fry.
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate the effects of different levels of dietary vitamin C on some skin mucus immune parameters, mucus antimicrobial activity and growth performance of Caspian roach (Rutilus rutilus caspicus) fry. Six hundred sixty Caspian roach (1.4 +/- 0.02 g) fry were allocated to 12 tanks (55 fish per tank), and triplicate groups were fed diets containing 0, 1,000, 1,500 and 2,000 mg kg(-1) vitamin C for 60 days. At the end of the trial, the epidermal mucus protein level, alkaline phosphatase and antimicrobial activity against two gram-positive bacteria (Streptococcus faecium and Micrococcus luteus) and gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli and Serratia marcescens) as well as growth performance were measured. The results demonstrated that feeding on vitamin C significantly elevated skin mucus alkaline phosphatase and protein levels compared to the control group (P < 0.05). However, lysozyme activity was undetectable in both the vitamin C-fed roach fry and the control group. Skin mucus antimicrobial activity was increased following vitamin C administration, and the bacterial growth inhibition zones were significantly elevated in vitamin C-fed roach (P < 0.05). Similar results were obtained in case of the minimum inhibitory concentration of skin mucus. Also fish fed the control diet had a significantly lower weight gain, specific growth rate and condition factor compared to the other treatments (P < 0.05). These results revealed that dietary vitamin C beneficially affects the skin mucus immune parameters and growth performance of Caspian roach fry.
TI  - Influence of acetylation degree and molecular weight of homogeneous chitosans on  antibacterial and antifungal activities.
AB  - The results given in the literature are conflicting when considering the relationship between antimicrobial activity and chitosan characteristics. To be able to clarify, we prepared fifteen homogeneous chitosans with different acetylation degrees (DA) and molecular weights (MW) by reacetylation of a fully deacetylated chitin under homogeneous conditions. They were tested at different pH values for their antimicrobial activities against four Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Salmonella typhi), four Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis and Micrococcus luteus) and three fungi (Aspergillus niger, Fusarium oxysporum and Alternaria solani). Chitosans markedly inhibited growth of most bacteria and fungi tested, although the inhibitory effect depends on the type of microorganism and on the chitosan characteristics (DA and MW) with minimum inhibitory concentrations in the range of 0.001 to 0.1 w%. Considering chitosan efficiency on bacteria, our series of data clearly show that the lower DA and the lower pH give the larger efficiency. Antibacterial activity was further enhanced for Gram-negative bacteria with decreasing MW, whereas, opposite effect was observed with the Gram-positive. Concerning the antifungal activity, the influence of chitosan characteristics was dependent on the particular type of fungus. Fungal growth decreased with increasing MW for F. oxysporum and decreasing DA for A. solani, but no MW or DA dependences were observed with A. niger.
TI  - IrFC - An Ixodes ricinus injury-responsive molecule related to Limulus Factor C.
AB  - Limulus Clotting Factor C is a multi-domain serine protease that triggers horseshoe crab hemolymph clotting in the presence of trace amounts of bacterial lipopolysaccharides. Here we describe and functionally characterize an homologous molecule, designated as IrFC, from the hard tick Ixodes ricinus. Tick Factor C consists of an N-terminal cysteine-rich domain, four complement control protein (sushi) modules, an LCCL domain, a truncated C-lectin domain and a C-terminal trypsin-type domain. Developmental expression profiling by quantitative real-time PCR revealed that the irfc mRNA is expressed in all stages including eggs. In tissues dissected from adult I. ricinus females, the irfc mRNA is present mainly in tick hemocytes and accordingly, indirect immunofluorescence microscopy localized IrFC intracellularly, in tick hemocytes. Irfc mRNA levels were markedly increased upon injection of sterile saline, or different microbes, demonstrating that the irfc gene transcription occurs in response to injury. This indicates a possible role of IrFC in hemolymph clotting and/or wound healing, although these defense mechanisms have not been yet definitely demonstrated in ticks. RNAi silencing of irfc expression resulted in a significant reduction in phagocytic activity of tick hemocytes against the Gram-negative bacteria Chryseobacterium indologenes and Escherichia coli, but not against the yeast, Candida albicans. This result suggests that IrFC plays a role in the tick primordial complement system and as such possibly mediates transmission of tick-borne pathogens.
TI  - New mixed ligand zinc(II) complexes based on the antiepileptic drug sodium valproate and bioactive nitrogen-donor ligands. Synthesis, structure and biological properties.
AB  - Starting from the precursor [Zinc Valproate complex] (1), new mixed ligand zinc(II) complexes of valproic acid and nitrogen-based ligands, formulating as, [Zn(valp)22,9-dmphen] (2), [Zn2(valp)4(quin)2] (3), [Zn(valp)2(2-ampy)2] (4), and [Zn(valp)2(2-ampic)2] (5) (valp = valproate, 2,9-dmphen = 2,9-dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroline, quin = quinoline, 2-ampy = 2-aminopyridine, 2-ampic = 2-amino-6-picoline) were synthesized and characterized using IR, (1)H NMR, (13)C{(1)H} NMR and UV-Vis spectrometry. The crystal structures of complexes 2, 3 and 4 were determined using single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The complexes were also evaluated for their anti-bacterial activity using in-vitro agar diffusion method against three Gram-positive (Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacillus subtilis) and three Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis) species. Complex 2 showed considerable activity against all tested microorganisms and the effect of complexation on the anti-bacterial activity of the parent ligand of 2 was also investigated. The anti-bacterial activity of 2,9-dmphen against Gram-negative bacteria was enhanced upon complexation with zinc valproate. On the other hand, complexes 1 and 3 showed weak inhibition activity against the tested species and complexes 4 and 5 didn't show any activity at all. Two methods were used for testing the inhibition of ferriprotoporphyrinIX bio-mineralization: a semi-quantitative micro-assay and a previously self-developed quantitative in-vitro method. Both were used to study the efficiency of these complexes in inhibiting the formation of the Malaria pigment which considered being the target of many known anti-malarial drugs such as Chloroquine and Amodiaquine. Results showed that the efficiency of complex 2 in preventing the formation of beta-Hematin was 80%. The efficiency of Amodiaquine as a standard drug was reported to give 91%.
TI  - First total syntheses and antimicrobial evaluation of penicimonoterpene, a marine-derived monoterpenoid, and its various derivatives.
AB  - The first total synthesis of marine-derived penicimonoterpene (+/-)-1 has been achieved in four steps from 6-methylhept-5-en-2-one using a Reformatsky reaction as the key step to construct the basic carbon skeleton. A total of 24 new derivatives of 1 have also been designed and synthesized. Their structures were characterized by analysis of their 1H NMR, 13C NMR and HRESIMS data. Some of them showed significant antibacterial activity against Aeromonas hydrophila, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Vibrio anguillarum, V. harveyi and/or V. parahaemolyticus, and some showed activity against plant-pathogenic fungi (Alternaria brassicae, Colletotrichum gloeosporioides and/or Fusarium graminearum). Some of the derivatives exhibited antimicrobial MIC values ranging from 0.25 to 4 mug/mL, which were stronger than those of the positive control. Notably, Compounds 3b and 10 showed extremely high selectively against plant-pathogenic fungus F. graminearum (MIC 0.25 mug/mL) and pathogenic bacteria E. coli (MIC 1 mug/mL), implying their potential as antimicrobial agents. SAR analysis of 1 and its derivatives indicated that modification of the carbon-carbon double bond at C-6/7, of groups on the allylic methylene unit and of the carbonyl group at C-1, effectively enhanced the antimicrobial activity.
TI  - Characterization and function analysis of an anti-lipopolysaccharide factor (ALF) from the Chinese shrimp Fenneropenaeus chinensis.
AB  - Anti-lipopolysaccharide factor (ALF) is one of the widely-studied antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) with broad-spectrum antibacterial activity and antiviral property. Previous studies show the existence of multiform of ALFs in crustacean which are important for immunity of the animals. In the present study, we characterized one isoform of ALF from the Chinese shrimp Fenneropenaeus chinensis (FcALF2). Tissue distribution analysis revealed that FcALF2 showed the highest expression level in the lymphoid organ (Oka) of the shrimp. The expression level of FcALF2 in shrimp was significantly up-regulated when they were injected with Micrococcus lysodeikticus and Vibrio anguillarum. A peptide corresponding to the LPS-binding domain of FcALF2 (FcALF2-LBD) was synthesized to analyze its antimicrobial activities. Data demonstrated that FcALF2-LBD possessed strong antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria Micrococcus luteus and M.lysodeikticus with MIC ranges of 2-4 muM and 1-2 muM respectively and significant inhibition activity against white spot syndrome virus (WSSV). The antibacterial activities of the sequence modified peptides (FcALF2-LBDb, FcALF2-LBDv) were apparently enhanced and broadened after the amount of basic amino acids was increased in the synthetic LPS-binding domain. These data provide more insights into understanding the function of LPS-binding domain of ALF and the role of ALF in shrimp immunity.
TI  - Design, characterization and expression of a novel hybrid peptides melittin (1-13)-LL37 (17-30).
AB  - Hybridizing of different antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) has been a common practice for obtaining novel hybrid AMPs with elevated antibacterial activity but minimized cytotoxicity. The hybrid peptides melittin (1-13)-LL37 (17-30) (M-L) combining the hydrophobic N-terminal fragment of melittin (M) with the core antibacterial fragment of LL37 (L), was designed for the first time to explore its antibacterial activity and hemolytic activity against bacteria and sheep erythrocyte respectively. Results showed that M-L had an even more potent antibacterial activity against all indicator strains (especially gram-positive bacteria) than M and L, whereas didn't exhibit hemolytic activity to sheep erythrocytes, implying M-L can be served as a potential therapeutic drug to substitute traditional antibiotics. However the high expense of biosynthesis limited its further research, therefore fusion expression of M-L was carried out in Escherichia coli (E. coli) for overproducing the hybrid peptide so as to solve the problem. The DNA sequence encoding M-L with preferred codons was cloned into the pET-SUMO vector for protein expression in E. coli BL21 (DE3). After IPTG induction, approximately 165 mg soluble fusion protein SUMO-M-L was recovered per liter supernatant of the fermentation ultrasonic lysate using Ni-NTA Sepharose column (92 % purity). And 23 mg recombinant M-L was obtained per liter culture after cleavage of SUMO protease and purification of Ni-NTA Sepharose column. In sum, this research not only supplied an effective approach for overproducing hybrid peptide M-L, but paved the way for its further exploration on pharmaceutical potential and medical importance.
TI  - Biochemical and functional characterization of transiently expressed in neural precursor (TENP) protein in emu egg white.
AB  - A protein transiently expressed in the neural precursors of developing tissues (TENP) was found to be present in emu (Dromaius novaehollandiae) egg white as one of the major proteins. Nucleotide analysis of its encoding cDNA revealed a sequence of 452 amino acids including a 19 amino acid peptide signal. Phylogenetic analysis determined that emu TENP was clustered within the bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein (BPI) superfamily together with other avian TENPs. RT-PCR analysis revealed that the emu TENP gene was highly expressed in the magnum of the oviduct, indicating that TENP is a major egg white component. Emu TENP was purified by anion exchange chromatography and ammonium sulfate fractionation. Unlike BPI, emu TENP exhibited antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria, including Micrococcus luteus and Bacillus subtilis, but not against Gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli and Salmonella Typhimurium. The results suggest that emu TENP is a potent novel antibacterial protein with a spectrum distinct from that of BPI.
TI  - Ecdysone mediates the development of immunity in the Drosophila embryo.
AB  - Beyond their role in cell metabolism, development, and reproduction, hormones are also important modulators of the immune system. In the context of inflammatory disorders, systemic administration of pharmacological doses of synthetic glucocorticoids (GCs) is widely used as an anti-inflammatory treatment [1, 2]. However, not all actions of GCs are immunosuppressive, and many studies have suggested that physiological concentrations of GCs can have immunoenhancing effects [3-7]. For a more comprehensive understanding of how steroid hormones regulate immunity and inflammation, a simple in vivo system is required. The Drosophila embryo has recently emerged as a powerful model system to study the recruitment of immune cells to sterile wounds [8] and host-pathogen dynamics [9]. Here we investigate the immune response of the fly embryo to bacterial infections and find that the steroid hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone (20-HE) can regulate the quality of the immune response and influence the resolution of infection in Drosophila embryos.
TI  - Immunohistochemical analysis of the role of hemocytin in nodule formation in the  larvae of the silkworm, Bombyx mori.
AB  - Hemocytin, a multidomain protein from Bombyx mori L. (Lepidoptera: Bombycidae), is an ortholog of von Willebrand factor and is expected to be a major mediator of hemocyte aggregation. Antiserum was generated against hemocytin, and immune staining of hemocytes, hemolymph, and nodules was performed. Hemocytin was observed in steady-state hemocytes but not in plasma, even after bacterial injection. When hemolymph was smeared on glass slides, hemocytin-containing fibrous structures formed a cellular network mainly consisting of granulocytes and oenocytoids. Hemocytin was stained only in the granules of the granulocytes. When nodule-like aggregates formed 30 sec after bacterial injection, both granulocytes and bacterial cells were observed binding to hemocytin-containing fibrous structures. When nodule sections were stained with antiserum, hemocytin was seen in the matrix of the nodules surrounding the hemocytes. These data suggest that hemocytin plays a major role in nodule formation as a component of the sticky fibrous structure exocytosed from granulocytes.
TI  - Synthesis, antimicrobial evaluation, and structure-activity relationship of alpha-pinene derivatives.
AB  - Several (+)- and (-)-alpha-pinene derivatives were synthesized and evaluated for  their antimicrobial activity toward Gram-positive bacteria Micrococcus luteus and Staphylococcus aureus, Gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli, and the unicellular fungus Candida albicans using bioautographic assays. (+)-alpha-Pinene 1a showed modest activity against the test organisms, whereas (-)-alpha-pinene 1b showed no activity at the tested concentration. Of all the alpha-pinene derivatives evaluated, the beta-lactam derivatives (10a and 10b) were the most antimicrobial. The increase in the antimicrobial activity of 10a compared to 1a ranged from nearly 3.5-fold (C. albicans) to 43-fold (S. aureus). The mean +/- standard deviation for the zone of inhibition (mm) for 10a (C. albicans) was 31.9 +/- 4.3 and that for S. aureus was 51.1 +/- 2.9. Although (-)-alpha-pinene 1b was not active toward the test microorganisms, the corresponding beta-lactam 10b, amino ester 13b, and amino alcohol 14b showed antimicrobial activity toward the test microorganisms. The increase in the antimicrobial activity of 10b compared to 1b ranged from 32-fold (S. aureus) to 73-fold (M. luteus). The mean +/- standard deviation for the zone of inhibition (mm) for 10b (S. aureus) was 32.0 +/- 0.60 and that for M. luteus was 73.2 +/- 0.30.
TI  - Structure-activity relationship of Trp-containing analogs of the antimicrobial peptide gomesin.
AB  - Gomesin (Gm) has a broad antimicrobial activity making it of great interest for development of drugs. In this study, we analyzed three Gm analogs, [Trp(1) ]-Gm, [Trp(7) ]-Gm, and [Trp(9) ]-Gm, in an attempt to gain insight into the contributions of different regions of the peptide sequence to its activity. The incorporation of the tryptophan residue in different positions has no effect on the antimicrobial and hemolytic activities of the Gm analogs in relation to Gm. Spectroscopic studies (circular dichroism, fluorescence and absorbance) of Gm and its analogs were performed in the presence of SDS, below and above its critical micelle concentration (CMC) (~8 mM), in order to monitor structural changes induced by the interaction with this anionic surfactant (0-15 mM). Interestingly, we found that the analogs interact more strongly with SDS at low concentrations (0.3-6.0 mM) than close to or above its CMC. This suggests that SDS monomers are able to cover the whole peptide, forming large detergent-peptide aggregates. On the other hand, the peptides interact differently with SDS micelles, inserting partially into the micelle core. Among the peptides, Trp in position 1 becomes more motionally-restricted in the presence of SDS, probably because this residue is located at the N-terminal region, which presents higher conformational freedom to interact stronger with SDS molecules. Trp residues in positions 7 and 9, close to and in the region of the turn of the molecule, respectively, induced a more constrained structure and the compounds cannot insert deeper into the micelle core or be completely buried by SDS monomers.
TI  - Amphiphilic cationic beta(3R3)-peptides: membrane active peptidomimetics and their potential as antimicrobial agents.
AB  - We introduce a novel class of membrane active peptidomimetics, the amphiphilic cationic beta(3R3)-peptides, and evaluate their potential as antimicrobial agents. The design criteria, the building block and oligomer synthesis as well as a detailed structure-activity relationship (SAR) study are reported. Specifically, infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (IRRAS) was employed to investigate structural features of amphiphilic cationic beta(3R3)-peptide sequences at the hydrophobic/hydrophilic air/liquid interface. Furthermore, Langmuir monolayers of anionic and zwitterionic phospholipids have been used to model the interactions of amphiphilic cationic beta(3R3)-peptides with prokaryotic and eukaryotic cellular membranes in order to predict their membrane selectivity and elucidate their mechanism of action. Lastly, antimicrobial activity was tested against Gram-positive M. luteus and S. aureus as well as against Gram-negative E. coli and P. aeruginosa bacteria along with testing hemolytic activity and cytotoxicity. We found that amphiphilic cationic beta(3R3)-peptide sequences combine high and selective antimicrobial activity with exceptionally low cytotoxicity in comparison to values reported in the literature. Overall, this study provides further insights into the SAR of antimicrobial peptides and peptidomimetics and indicates that amphiphilic cationic beta(3R3)-peptides are strong candidates for further development as antimicrobial agents with high therapeutic index.
TI  - Antiparasitic chaiyaphumines from entomopathogenic Xenorhabdus sp. PB61.4.
AB  - A new class of four depsipentapeptides called chaiyaphumines A-D (1-4) was isolated from Xenorhabdus sp. PB61.4. Their structures were elucidated by detailed 1D and 2D NMR experiments and by a Marfey's analysis following flash hydrolysis of the peptide. Verification of the structure was achieved by three-dimensional modeling using NOE-derived distance constraints, molecular dynamics, and energy minimization. Chaiyaphumine A (1) showed good activity against Plasmodium falciparum (IC50 of 0.61 muM), the causative agent of malaria, and was active against other protozoal tropical disease causing agents.
TI  - Antibacterial properties of water-soluble gold(I) N-heterocyclic carbene complexes.
AB  - The antibacterial properties of water-soluble gold(I) complexes [1-methyl-3-(3-sulfonatopropyl)imidazol-2-ylidene]gold(I) chloride (C1), [1-mesityl-3-(3-sulfonatopropyl)imidazol-2-ylidene]gold(I) chloride (C2), [1-(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)-3-(3-sulfonatopropyl)imidazol-2-ylidene]gold(I) chloride (C3) and [1,3-bis(2,6-diisopropyl-4-sodiumsulfonatophenyl)imidazol-2-ylidene]gold(I) chloride (C4) and the respective ligands were assessed by agar diffusion and broth macrodilution methods against Gram-positives Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis and Micrococcus luteus and the Gram-negative bacteria Yersinia ruckeri, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli. Viability after treatments was determined by direct plate count. The bactericidal activity displayed by C1 and C3 was comparable to that of AgNO3.
TI  - Modification of a synthetic LPS-binding domain of anti-lipopolysaccharide factor  from shrimp reveals strong structure-activity relationship in their antimicrobial characteristics.
AB  - Anti-lipopolysaccharide factor (ALF) is a small protein with broad-spectrum antimicrobial activities and certain antiviral property. Its putative lipopolysaccharide (LPS) binding domain was deduced to be important for its activities. However, there is still no report revealing how the structure of the LPS-binding domain affects its biological function until now. In the present study, we designed and synthesized a peptide corresponding to the LPS-binding domain of ALF from the Chinese shrimp (designated as FcALF-LBDc) and its structure-modified isoforms in order to analyze the relationship between its structure and antimicrobial activities. Results showed that FcALF-LBDc exhibited apparent antibacterial activities against both Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli and Vibrio anguillarum and Gram-positive bacteria Micrococcus luteus and Micrococcus lysodeikticus with MIC ranges of 32-64, 2-4, 1-2, and 32-64muM, respectively. The disulfide loop and the basic amino acids in the LPS-binding domain (LBD) of ALF played key roles in its antibacterial activities. In addition, FcALF-LBDc could reduce the propagation of white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) in vivo, and its lysine residue is indispensable for its antiviral property. This is the first attempt to testify the effects of the sequence features of the LPS-binding domain on its antimicrobial activities.
TI  - Facile method for the synthesis of silver nanoparticles using 3-hydrazino-isatin  derivatives in aqueous methanol and their antibacterial activity.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: A new method for preparation of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) based  on using hydrazino-isatin derivatives in an aqueous methanol reaction medium is reported here. AgNPs were prepared using silver nitrate solubilized in a water core as the source of silver ions and 3-hydrazino-isatin derivatives (3-hydrazino-isatin [IsH] and 1-benzyl-3-hydrazino-isatin [BIsH]) solubilized in methanol core as a reducing agent. The proposed method is effective, rapid, and convenient. X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy dispersive X-ray analysis, scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used for characterization of the AgNPs. The TEM micrographs confirmed that the nanopowders consist of well-dispersed agglomerates of grains with a narrow size distribution of 18-21 nm and 17-20 nm. The AgNPs, as well as BIsH, showed high antimicrobial and bactericidal activity against the Gram-positive Bacillus subtilis and Gram-negative Micrococcus luteus and Proteus vulgaris, as well as antifungal activities against Saccharomyces cerevisiae. On the other hand, they were not effective against the Gram-negative Escherichia coli. PURPOSE: A simple, effective, rapid, and convenient chemical reduction method for the synthesis of AgNPs in an aqueous methanol reaction medium using hydrazino-isatin derivatives and studying their antibacterial effect. RESULTS: IsH and BIsH are remarkably powerful reductants for Ag+ ions in an aqueous methanol medium, which could be considered as a simple chemical reduction method for formation of AgNPs. The AgNP formation depends on the solubility of the hydrazino-isatin derivatives. BIsH gave more AgNPs than IsH, as observed from XRD. The formation of AgNPs is attributed to the adsorption of hydrazine derivatives and/or interparticle interaction on the surface of AgNP through electrostatic interactions between the lone pair electrons of the hydrazino group (C=N-NH2) and the positive surface of AgNPs. AgNPs and BIsH showed high antimicrobial and bacterial activity. CONCLUSION: In summary, it is shown that IsH and BIsH are remarkably powerful reductants for Ag+ ions in an aqueous methanol medium. BIsH gave more AgNPs than IsH, as observed from XRD due to better solubility of the BIsH than IsH in aqueous-methanol. The formation of AgNPs is attributed to the adsorption of hydrazine derivatives and/or interparticle interaction on the surface of AgNPs through electrostatic interactions between the lone pair electrons of the hydrazino group (C=N-NH2) and the positive surface of AgNPs. The AgNps as well as BIsH ligand showed high antimicrobial and bactericidal activity.
TI  - Structure-activity study of macropin, a novel antimicrobial peptide from the venom of solitary bee Macropis fulvipes (Hymenoptera: Melittidae).
AB  - A novel antimicrobial peptide, designated macropin (MAC-1) with sequence Gly-Phe-Gly-Met-Ala-Leu-Lys-Leu-Leu-Lys-Lys-Val-Leu-NH2 , was isolated from the venom of the solitary bee Macropis fulvipes. MAC-1 exhibited antimicrobial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, antifungal activity, and moderate hemolytic activity against human red blood cells. A series of macropin analogs were prepared to further evaluate the effect of structural alterations on antimicrobial and hemolytic activities and stability in human serum. The antimicrobial activities of several analogs against pathogenic Pseudomonas aeruginosa were significantly increased while their toxicity against human red blood cells was decreased. The activity enhancement is related to the introduction of either l- or d-lysine in selected positions. Furthermore, all-d analog and analogs with d-amino acid residues introduced at the N-terminal part of the peptide chain exhibited better serum stability than did natural macropin. Data obtained by CD spectroscopy suggest a propensity of the peptide to adopt an amphipathic alpha-helical secondary structure in the presence of trifluoroethanol or membrane-mimicking sodium dodecyl sulfate. In addition, the study elucidates the structure-activity relationship for the effect of d-amino acid substitutions in MAC-1 using NMR spectroscopy.
TI  - Campechic acids A and B: anti-invasive polyether polyketides from a soil-derived  Streptomyces.
AB  - Campechic acids A (1) and B (2), two new polyketides, were isolated from the culture extract of Streptomyces sp., and their structures were determined by NMR and MS spectroscopic analysis. Campechic acids are polyether-polyketides functionalized by two tetrahydrofuran rings, an enolized 1,3-diketone, and multiple methyl substitutions. Absolute configuration of nine stereogenic centers in 1, except for four chiral centers in the cyclic ether moieties, was determined by the 1H NMR anisotropy method in combination with chemical degradation. Campechic acids exhibited potent inhibitory effects on tumor cell invasion with IC50 values in the nanomolar to submicromolar range.
TI  - Plantaricin LD1: a bacteriocin produced by food isolate of Lactobacillus plantarum LD1.
AB  - Plantaricin LD1, a bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus plantarum LD1, was characterized for biochemical and antimicrobial properties. Bacteriocin showed stability at high temperatures (100 degrees C for 20 min and 121 degrees C for 15 min under 15 psi pressure), in a pH range of 2.0-8.0 and also in the presence of organic solvents, surfactants and detergents. The crude preparation was not affected by catalase, amylase and lipase but activity was reduced in the presence of pepsin, trypsin and proteinase K showing proteinaceous nature of the compound. The molecular weight of bacteriocin was found to be approximately 6.5 kDa, and antimicrobial activity was confirmed by bioassay. It inhibited not only related strains but also other Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria such as Lactobacillus curvatus NRRL B-4562, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis NRRL B-1821, Enterococcus faecium NRRL B-2354, Enterobacter cloacae NRRL B-14298, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, urogenic Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri and Vibrio sp. These properties of plantaricin LD1 suggest its applications not only in food safety but in therapeutics as well.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of polyacrylonitrile-chitosan electrospun nanofibers.
AB  - Polyacrylonitrile (PAN)-chitosan double-face films and nanofibers were manufactured. PAN and a chitosan salt were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide, and then thin-layered on a glass plate or electro-spun followed by coagulation in sodium hydroxide solution. The morphology of the PAN-chitosan double-face films and nanofibers was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy. The thermal behavior and the glass transition temperature of PAN-chitosan blends were assessed by differential scanning calorimetry and dynamic mechanical analysis, respectively. The antibacterial efficacy was measured by a swatch test with bacterial suspensions. The PAN-chitosan nanofibers produced a 5-log reduction against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Micrococcus luteus.
TI  - Heterologous expression and purification of dermaseptin S4 fusion in Escherichia  coli and recovery of biological activity.
AB  - Heterologous expression of dermaseptin S4 (DS4), which has cytolytic activity in  vitro against a broad spectrum of pathogenic microorganisms, was examined in Escherichia coli. The plasmid pGEX-4T-1, encoding DS4 fused with glutathione S-transferase (GST), was constructed and cloned into the E. coli strain BL21 (DE3). The fusion protein was overexpressed in this strain after induction with isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and purified to homogeneity using GST affinity chromatography. To recover biologically active DS4, the purified fusion protein was cleaved using thrombin protease; the liberated DS4 was shown to be bactericidally active against an indicator strain. Since it is less expensive to obtain such a peptide biologically, in this study, we report for the first time a method to express purify DS4 in E. coli using a GST fusion system.
TI  - Evaluating the antimicrobial activity of methonolic extract of rhus succedanea leaf gall.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The worldwide increased bacterial resistance to antibiotics and the undesirable side effects associated with constant use of synthetic drugs has prompted the search for novel antimicrobial agents, particularly those manufactured from plants. This study is designed to ascertain the antibacterial potential of Rhus succedanea leaf gall extracts on the growth of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. METHODS: The methanolic and hexane extract of different concentrations (100, 250, and 500 mug/ml) were prepared and their antibacterial efficacy was tested against clinical isolates of Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, Micrococcus luteus, and Staphylococcus aureus using agar well diffusion method and the size of inhibition zone was measured in millimeters. RESULTS: The methanol and hexane extracts differed significantly in their antimicrobial activity with methanol extract showing a potent inhibitory activity in the range of 16+/-2 to 23+/-1, which was almost equal to the values of ciprofloxacin (25+/-3), used as a standard. Further, the methanol extract was mostly potent and effective in inhibiting the growth of gram-negative bacteria, namely, E. coli, when compared to gram -positive bacteria stains, which are responsible for antimicrobial activities. The phytochemical screening showed positive results for the presence of steroids, triterpenes, alkaloids, and carbohydrates. CONCLUSION: The potent antibacterial activity of Rhus succedanea leaf gall extracts indicates its useful therapeutic application against bacterial infection. Furthermore, this study indicates that the extract might be exploited as natural drug for the treatment of infectious diseases and could be useful in understanding the relations between traditional cures and current medications.
TI  - Further in vitro evaluation of antiradical and antimicrobial activities of phytol.
AB  - The antiradical activity of phytol was evaluated by electron paramagnetic resonance towards hydroxyl radical (.OH), superoxide anion radical (.O2(-)), methoxy radical (.CH2OH), carbon-dioxide anion radical (.CO2(-)), as well as towards nitric-oxide radical (.NO) and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (.DPPH) radical. It reduced the production of all tested radicals showing more promising activity against .CO2(-), .CH2OH and .DPPH radicals (56%, 50% and 48%, respectively) in comparison with .NO, .O2(-) and .OH radicals (38%, 23% and 15%, respectively). The antimicrobial activity of phytol was evaluated by the microdilution method against eight bacterial and eight fungal strains. To varying degrees, it was proven to be active against all tested bacteria and fungi (MIC 0.003-0.038 mg/mL and MBC 0.013-0.052 mg/mL, MIC 0.008-0.016 mg/mL and MFC 0.090-0.520 mg/mL, respectively). According to the obtained results, medical foods containing phytol may support development of new therapies for heart disease.
TI  - Antimicrobial function of the GAPDH-related antimicrobial peptide in the skin of  skipjack tuna, Katsuwonus pelamis.
AB  - A 3.4 kDa of antimicrobial peptide was purified from an acidified skin extract of skipjack tuna, Katsuwonus pelamis, by preparative acid-urea-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and C18 reversed-phase HPLC. A comparison of the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified peptide with that of other known polypeptides revealed high sequence homology with the YFGAP (Yellowfin tuna Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase-related Antimicrobial Peptide); thus, this peptide was identified as the skipjack tuna GAPDH-related antimicrobial peptide (SJGAP). SJGAP showed potent antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria, such as Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus iniae (minimal effective concentrations [MECs], 1.2-17.0 mug/mL), Gram-negative bacteria, such as Aeromonas hydrophila, Escherichia coli D31, and Vibrio parahaemolyticus (MECs, 3.1-12.0 mug/mL), and against Candida albicans (MEC, 16.0 mug/mL) without significant hemolytic activity. Antimicrobial activity of this peptide is heat-stable but salt-sensitive. According to the secondary structural prediction and the homology modeling, this peptide consists of three secondary structural motifs, including one alpha-helix and two parallel beta-strands, and forms an amphipathic structure. This peptide showed neither membrane permeabilization ability nor killing ability, but did display a small degree of leakage ability. These results suggest that SJGAP acts through a bacteriostatic process rather than bactericidal one. SJGAP is another GAPDH-related antimicrobial peptide isolated from skipjack tuna and likely plays an important role for GAPDH in the innate immune defense of tuna fish.
TI  - Commercial probiotic bacteria and prebiotic carbohydrates: a fundamental study on prebiotics uptake, antimicrobials production and inhibition of pathogens.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Probiotics and prebiotics are among the most important functional food ingredients worldwide. The proven benefits of such ingredients to human health have encouraged the development of functional foods containing both probiotics and prebiotics. In this work, the production of antimicrobial compounds coupled to the uptake of commercial prebiotics by probiotic bacteria was investigated. RESULTS: The probiotic bacteria studied were able to take up commercial prebiotic carbohydrates to the same or higher extent than that observed for lactose (control carbohydrate). The growth of probiotic bacteria was coupled to the production of antimicrobials such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), H2 O2 and bacteriocins. A higher production of antimicrobial compounds was recorded with Oligomate 55(R) compared with Regulact(R) and Frutafit(R) (3-5 and 10-115 times higher SCFA and H2 O2 production, respectively). The probiotic bacteria grown with Oligomate 55(R) also produced bacteriocins and other non-identified antimicrobial compounds. The antimicrobials produced by the probiotic bacteria inhibited up to 50% the growth of model pathogens such as Escherichia coli, Listeria innocua and Micrococcus luteus compared with control cultures. CONCLUSIONS: The results here obtained are useful for the adequate selection of probiotic/prebiotics pairs and therefore in the development of efficient functional foods.
TI  - Estimation of flavoniods, antimicrobial, antitumor and anticancer activity of Carissa opaca fruits.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Carissa opaca Stapf ex Hanes fruits is traditionally used in the treatment of asthma, hepatitis and microbial infections. The present study was arranged to investigate the antimicrobial, cytotoxic and antitumor activity of various fractions of C. opaca extract and its bioactive metabolites responsible for that activity. METHODS: To characterize various fractions of C.opaca antibacterial, antifungal, cytotoxic and antitumor assays are used. Eight strains of bacteria including Bacillus subtilis, Enterobactor aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Micrococcus luteus, Pseudomonas aeroginosa, Salmonella typhy, and Staphylococcus aureus and four strains of fungal viz: Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus niger and Fusarium solani are used. Brine shrimps and potato dics are used for anticancer and antitumor potency of extract. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) is utilized for determination of bioactive metabolites responsible for the activity. RESULTS: HPLC chromatogram revealed the presence of orientin, isoquercetin, myricetin and apigenin. Various fractions of C. oapca showed significant antibacterial, antitumor and anticancer activity. In case of C. opaca fruit inhibition growth of Aspergillus niger was ranged between 23.2 +/- 1.36% to 43.3 +/- 2.39%, Aspergillus flavus ranged between 27.6 +/- 1.39% to 65.6 +/- 3.44%, Aspergillus fumigatus ranged between 13.2 +/- 1.00% to 52.4 +/- 1.54% and Fusarium solani ranged between 10.5 +/- 1.02% to 14.6 +/- 1.74%. CONCLUSION: It can be concluded that, various fractions of C.opaca are accessible source of ethno pharmacy as they are consumed in different areas of Pakistan with ultimate health compensations.
TI  - Evaluation of antibacterial properties of Barium Zirconate Titanate (BZT) nanoparticle.
AB  - So far, the antibacterial activity of some organic and inorganic compounds has been studied. Barium zirconate titanate [Ba(ZrxTi(1)-x)O(3)] (x = 0.05) nanoparticle is an example of inorganic materials. In vitro studies have provided evidence for the antibacterial activity of this nanoparticle. In the current study, the nano-powder was synthesized by sol-gel method. X-ray diffraction showed that the powder was single-phase and had a perovskite structure at the calcination temperature of 1000 degrees C. Antibacterial activity of the desired nanoparticle was assessed on two gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus PTCC1431 and Micrococcus luteus PTCC1625) and two gram-negative (Escherichia coli HP101BA 7601c and clinically isolated Klebsiella pneumoniae) bacteria according to Radial Diffusion Assay (RDA). The results showed that the antibacterial activity of BZT nano-powder on both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria was acceptable. The minimum inhibitory concentration of this nano-powder was determined. The results showed that MIC values for E. coli, K. pneumoniae, M. luteus and S. aureus were about 2.3 mug/mL, 7.3 mug/mL, 3 mug/mL and 12 mug/mL, respectively. Minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) was also evaluated and showed that the growth of E. coli, K. pneumoniae, M. luteus and S. aureus could be decreased at 2.3, 14, 3 and 18 mug/mL of BZT. Average log reduction in viable bacteria count in time-kill assay ranged between 6 Log(1)(0) cfu/mL to zero after 24 h of incubation with BZT nanoparticle.
TI  - [Effect of metabolites of H2O2-producing lactobacilli on functional activity of lysozyme].
AB  - AIM: Study the effect of metabolites of H2O2-producing lactobacilli on enzymatic  and bactericidal activity of lysozyme. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 9 H2O2-producing vaginal lactobacilli, Micrococcus luteus NCTC 2665, Escherichia coli State Institute of Standardization and Control No 240367, Lactobacillus acidophilus Institute of Cellular and Intracellular Symbiosis No 37 were used. Ability of lactobacilli to produce H2O2 was evaluated by oxidation of tetramethylbenzidine by peroxidase. Lysozyme was modified by mixing with equal volumes of lactobacilli metabolites, metabolites of H2O2-producing vaginal lactobacilli previously treated with catalase were used in control. Lysozyme enzymatic activity was determined by speed of M. luteus lysis, bactericidal--by survivability of E. coli in Endo medium and L. acidophilus--in MRS medium. RESULTS: Decrease of enzymatic activity of lysozyme due to its contact with H2O2-producing lactobacilli metabolites was detected. This effect is accompanied by growth of bactericidal activity of lysozyme against E. coli and decrease against L. acidophilus. The degree of changes of enzymatic and bactericidal activity of lysozyme by lactobacilli metabolites depended on concentration of hydrogen peroxide in them. CONCLUSION: Modification of lysozyme by H2O2-producing lactobacilli metabolites resulting in opposite changes of its activity against autochthonous and allchthonous bacteria is one of the mechanisms of formation of stable microbial biocenosis in human organism.
TI  - Capillary electrophoresis of microbial aggregates.
AB  - Uncontrolled aggregation of bacterial cells is a significant disadvantage of electrophoretic separations. Various aspects of the electrophoretic behavior of different strains of Gram-positive Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Sarcina lutea, Staphylococcus aureus(1), and Micrococcus luteus bacteria and Gram-negative Escherichia coli bacteria were investigated in this study. Our findings indicate that bacteria can be rapidly analyzed by CZE with surface charge modification by calcium ions (Ca(2+)). Bound Ca(2+) ions increase zeta potential to more than 2.0 mV and significantly reduce repulsive forces. Under the above conditions, bacterial cells create compact aggregates, and fewer high-intensity signals are observed in electropherograms. The above can be attributed to the bridging effect of Ca(2+) between bacterial cells. CE was performed to analyze bacterial aggregates in an isotachophoretic mode. A single peak was observed in the electropherogram.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of resin rich plant extracts.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The in vitro antibacterial activity of resin rich methanolic extracts (RRMEs) of Commiphora myrrha, Operculina turpethum, and Pinus roxburghii. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Different concentration were studied by agar-well diffusion method against Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, Enterococcus faecalis) and Gram-negative bacterial strains (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Shigella dysenteriae). RESULTS: Among all the bacterial strains tested, E. faecalis was most sensitive and S. typhi was resistant to C. myrrha and P. roxburghii. The extracts of O. turpethum were active against all tested strains in which B. subtilis and S. aureus were the most sensitive. CONCLUSION: This suggested that the antibacterial activity of RRMEs of O. turpethum was more than C. myrrha and P. roxburghii. This probably explains the potential of these plants against a number of infections caused by bacterial strains tested.
TI  - Factors functioning in nodule melanization of insects and their mechanisms of accumulation in nodules.
AB  - Nodules consisting of hemocytes and trapped microorganisms are important targets  for melanization, which is best known in the insect immune system. We investigated factors functioning in nodule melanization and the mechanism by which these factors congregate in the nodule. BmHP21, BmSPH1 and BmSPH2, Bombyx mori orthologs of Manduca sexta serine protease HP21, serine protease homologs (SPH1 and SPH2), and a prophenoloxidase, BmPO1 were observed as inactive forms in the plasma, but as putatively active forms in the nodule. Production of prophenoloxidase-activating proteinases, BmPAP1 and BmPAP3/PPAE and BmPO1 were confirmed in hemocytes. BmSPH1 and BmSPH2 were observed on trapped bacterial cells in the nodule and were isolated from the surface of bacterial cells incubated with plasma. BmSPH1 and BmSPH2 were found in plasma in complex with a pattern recognition receptor, BmLBP. These data suggest that melanization-regulating factors congregate in nodules through a combination of microorganism-dependent and hemocyte-dependent routes.
TI  - Protective role of the neuropeptide urocortin II against experimental sepsis and  leishmaniasis by direct killing of pathogens.
AB  - We currently face an alarming resurgence in infectious diseases characterized by  antimicrobial resistance and therapeutic failure. This has generated the urgent need of developing new therapeutic approaches that include agents with nontraditional modes of action. A recent interest focused on approaches based on our natural immune defenses, especially on peptides that combine innate antimicrobial activity against diverse pathogens and immunoregulatory functions. In this study, to our knowledge, we describe for the first time the antimicrobial activity of the neuropeptide urocortin II (UCNII) against a panel of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and tropical parasites of the genus Leishmania. Importantly, this cytotoxicity was selective for pathogens, because UCNII did not affect mammalian cell viability. Structurally, UCNII has a cationic and amphipathic design that resembles antimicrobial peptides. Using mutants and UCNII fragments, we determined the structural requirements for the interaction between the peptide and the surface of pathogen. Following its binding to pathogen, UCNII caused cell death through different membrane-disrupting mechanisms that involve aggregation and membrane depolarization in bacteria and pore formation in Leishmania. Noteworthily, UCNII killed the infective form of Leishmania major even inside the infected macrophages. Consequently, UCNII prevented mortality caused by polymicrobial sepsis and ameliorated pathological signs of cutaneous leishmaniasis. Besides its presence in body physical and mucosal barriers, we found that innate immune cells produce UCNII in response to infections. Therefore, UCNII could be considered as an ancient highly-conserved host peptide involved in the natural antimicrobial defense and emerge as an attractive alternative to current treatments for microbial disorders with associated drug resistances.
TI  - Elution kinetics, antimicrobial activity, and mechanical properties of 11 different antibiotic loaded acrylic bone cement.
AB  - Antibiotic-loaded acrylic bone cements (ALABC) spacers are routinely used in the  treatment of prosthetic joint infections. The objectives of our study were to evaluate different ALABC for elution kinetics, thermal stability, and mechanical properties. A 10 or 20% mixture (w/w) beads of medium viscosity bone cement (DePuy, Inc) and vancomycin (VAN), gentamycin (GM), daptomycin (DAP), moxifloxacin (MOX), rifampicin (RIF), cefotaxime (CTX), cefepime (FEP), amoxicillin clavulanate (AmC), ampicillin (AMP), meropenem (MER), and ertapenem (ERT) were formed and placed into wells filled with phosphate-buffered saline. Antibiotic concentrations were determined using high-performance liquid chromatography. Antimicrobial activity was tested against Micrococcus luteus ATCC 9341 or Escherichia coli ATCC 25922. AmC, AMP, and FEP concentration rapidly decreased after day 2, being almost undetectable at day 4. Sustained and high elution rates were observed with VAN, GM, MOX, and RIF for the 30-day duration of the experiment. DAP, MER, ERT, and CTX elution rates constantly decreased from day 4. All antibiotics tested retained antimicrobial activity proving thermal stability. Mechanical properties of ALABC were maintained except when RIF was used.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of antihypertensive food-derived peptides and selected alanine analogues.
AB  - This study evaluated four food-derived peptides with known antihypertensive activities for antimicrobial activity against pathogenic microorganisms, and assessed structure-function relationships using alanine analogues. The peptides (EVSLNSGYY, barley; PGTAVFK, soybean; TTMPLW, alpha-casein; VHLPP, alpha-zein) and the six alanine substitution peptides of PGTAVFK were synthesised, characterised and evaluated for antimicrobial activity using the bacteria, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Micrococcus luteus and the yeast, Candida albicans. The peptides TTMPLW and PGTAVFK inhibited growth of all four microorganisms tested, with activities of a similar order of magnitude to ampicillin and ethanol controls. EVSLNSGYY inhibited the growth of the bacteria, but VHLPP showed no antimicrobial activity. The alanine analogue, PGAAVFK showed the highest overall antimicrobial activity and PGTAVFA showed no activity; overall, the activities of the analogues were consistent with their structures. Some peptides with antihypertensive activity also show antimicrobial activity, suggesting that food-derived peptides may exert beneficial effects via a number of mechanisms.
TI  - Identification and expression profile analysis of antimicrobial peptide/protein in Asian corn borer, Ostrinia furnacalis (Guenee).
AB  - Antimicrobial peptides/proteins (AMPs) are a group of immune proteins that exhibit strong antibiotic properties against numerous infectious bacterial strains. They are evolutionarily conserved and present in every kingdom and phylum, ranging from prokaryotes to humans. We analyzed the transciptome from the larvae of Asian corn borer, Ostrinia furnacalis (Guenee), and identified several putative AMP transcripts, OfgLys5, OfgLys6, OfgLys10, OfgAtt, and OfgIID. OfgLys5, OfgLys6, and OfgLys10 are all highly homologous with c-type lysozymes, and OfgAtt shows significant identities with Lepidoptera attacin. The amino acid sequence of OfgLys5 and OfgLys6 possessed all conserved features critical for fundamental structure and function of c-type lysozyme, including the two catalytic sites, Glu(32) and Asp(50). OfgAtt is a typical glycine-rich protein. The antimicrobial activity of O. furnacalis hemolymph increased significantly after injection with Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, or Beauveria bassiana. OfgAtt, IDD, and Lys6 are expressed at low level prior to the challenge, but strongly induced against Gram-positive and negative bacteria, and fungi. Under the same inducement conditions, the transcripts of these three genes elevated most when fifth instar larvae were injected. Therefore, O. furnacalis larvae are induced to produce antimicrobial materials in the hemolymph after the infection, and increase of lysozyme and attacin may contribute to the antimicrobial activity.
TI  - Antimicrobial and free radical scavenging activities of five Palestinian medicinal plants.
AB  - Extracts from five indigenous Palestinian medicinal plants including Rosmarinus officinalis, Pisidium guajava, Punica granatum peel, grape seeds and Teucrium polium were investigated for antimicrobial and free radical scavenging activities against eight microorganisms, using well diffusion method. The microorganisms included six bacterial isolates (i.e. Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginos, Klebsiella pneumonia, Bacillus subtilis and Micrococcus luteus) and two fungal isolates (i.e. Candida albicans and Aspergillus niger). A standard antioxidant assay was performed on the plant extracts to assess their capability in scavenging 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH). Of the five tested plant extract, only Rosmarinus offcinalis extract contained significant antimicrobial activity against all eight microbial isolates including Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Extracts from other four plants exhibited a variable antimicrobial activity against all microorganisms, except Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Significant antioxidant activity was detected in all plant extracts. However, extracts from Pisidium guajava leaves contained significantly higher antioxidant activity compared to the other extracts tested. The antimicrobial and scavenging activities detected in this in vitro study in extracts from the five Palestinian medicinal plants suggest that further study is needed to identify active compounds to target diseases caused by a wide-spectrum pathogens.
TI  - Facile regioselective synthesis of novel bis-thiazole derivatives and their antimicrobial activity.
AB  - The design and synthesis of several new bis-thiazoles 4a-h serving as bis-drugs in comparison with mono-heterocyclic analogs are described. These bis-drugs present superior medicinal and pharmacological activities against both gram-negative (Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli) and gram-positive (Micrococcus luteus and Bacillus subtilis) bacteria, which are in general more sensitive to compounds with higher hydrophobicity. Compounds with higher hydrophobicity (4d and 4h) exhibited some activity against the gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - The presence of antibiotic-resistant nosocomial pathogens in endotracheal tube biofilms and corresponding surveillance cultures.
AB  - Mechanically ventilated patients often develop ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Soon after intubation, a mixed biofilm harboring microbial pathogens is formed on the endotracheal tube (ET). It is believed that this biofilm contributes to the development of VAP. Unfortunately, the causative agent is often not known at the time VAP is suspected, and early therapy often relies on the identification of surveillance cultures (SC). It is thus important to know whether these SC can predict the microbial flora in ET biofilms. In this study, we compare the presence of a number of antibiotic-resistant nosocomial bacteria (Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis) and of Candida albicans in cultures from ET biofilms and SC (i.e. sputum samples, nose swabs, and throat swabs) of 20 mechanically ventilated patients. Our data indicate that there is a good correlation between the presence of (antibiotic-resistant) pathogens in ET biofilms and SC.
TI  - Developing a microbiological growth inhibition screening assay for the detection  of 27 veterinary drugs from 13 different classes in animal feedingstuffs.
AB  - Many regulations prohibit using veterinary drugs in feedingstuffs to protect consumers and animals alike. Within this investigation we developed a simple, cost-efficient primary screening method for detecting antibiotics and coccidiostats in animal feeds. Thirty-two veterinary drugs were originally considered. Following matrix-free testing to optimise detection, an assay based on matrix extraction with methanol/acetonitrile/phosphate buffer followed by inoculation and diffusion in agar plates was developed. Final validation was performed with 14 representative drugs (one per drug class) and four bacteria (Escherichia coli ATCC11303 and ATCC27166, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC6538P, Micrococcus luteus ATCC9341) in bovine, lamb and swine fodder, measuring growth inhibition zones. Of the original drugs tested, 27 remained detectable in feed matrices at or below 20 mg kg(-1). Of the 14 validated representatives, two had estimated minimum detectable concentrations of 10-11 mg kg(-1), others of 5 mg kg(-1) or lower, an earlier minimum European Union inclusion rate for many veterinary drugs. No significant matrix effect on inhibition zones was detected. Per cent wrong negative deviations ranged from 0% (nine of 14 compounds) to 20-27% (two of 14), while inter-day precision based on inhibition zones had relative standard deviations (RSDs) of 6-109% (mean of 40%). When setting a 1 mm inhibition zone, the maximum observed for negative controls, as a cut-off level, no false-positives were found. While not all targeted antibiotics were detectable in complex matrices, the majority of veterinary drugs were detected with reasonable sensitivity, indicating that this method could be suitable for screening feedingstuffs prior to further confirmatory investigation of positive findings such as by LC-MS/MS.
TI  - Identification and functional analysis of the peptidoglycan recognition protein LD gene in the mosquito, Armigeres subalbatus.
AB  - Peptidoglycan recognition proteins are important recognition proteins in many organisms ranging from echinoderms to humans. In an attempt to characterize all the PGRPs in the mosquito Armigeres subalbatus, two PGRP-LD isoforms, AsPGRP-LDa and AsPGRP-LDb, which are orthologs of the PGRP-LDs in several other insect species, were identified from this mosquito using homologous cloning. To date the functions of this PGRP gene have not yet been described in detail in other organisms with a known PGRP-LD gene. In the current study, we analyzed the sequences of these AsPGRP-LDs, their evolutionary relationships with their orthologs, their transcriptional expression in various developmental stages and different tissue samples, and their transcriptional responses to different bacterial stimuli. We then knocked down the expression of both AsPGRP-LDs by injection of double-stranded RNAs, and assessed the impact of AsPGRP-LD RNAi on mosquito survival after bacterial challenges and on the transcriptional expression of a number of antimicrobial peptides.
TI  - Exposure to bacterial signals does not alter pea aphids' survival upon a second challenge or investment in production of winged offspring.
AB  - Pea aphids have an obligate nutritional symbiosis with the bacteria Buchneraaphidicola and frequently also harbor one or more facultative symbionts. Aphids are also susceptible to bacterial pathogen infections, and it has been suggested that aphids have a limited immune response towards such pathogen infections compared to other, more well-studied insects. However, aphids do possess at least some of the genes known to be involved in bacterial immune responses in other insects, and immune-competent hemocytes. One possibility is that immune priming with microbial elicitors could stimulate immune protection against subsequent bacterial infections, as has been observed in several other insect systems. To address this hypothesis we challenged aphids with bacterial immune elicitors twenty-four hours prior to live bacterial pathogen infections and then compared their survival rates to aphids that were not pre-exposed to bacterial signals. Using two aphid genotypes, we found no evidence for immune protection conferred by immune priming during infections with either Serratia marcescens or with Escherichia coli. Immune priming was not altered by the presence of facultative, beneficial symbionts in the aphids. In the absence of inducible immune protection, aphids may allocate energy towards other defense traits, including production of offspring with wings that could escape deteriorating conditions. To test this, we monitored the ratio of winged to unwinged offspring produced by adult mothers of a single clone that had been exposed to bacterial immune elicitors, to live E. coli infections or to no challenge. We found no correlation between immune challenge and winged offspring production, suggesting that this mechanism of defense, which functions upon exposure to fungal pathogens, is not central to aphid responses to bacterial infections.
TI  - A C-type lectin (AiCTL-3) from bay scallop Argopecten irradians with mannose/galactose binding ability to bind various bacteria.
AB  - C-type lectins are a family of Ca(2+)-dependent carbohydrate-binding proteins playing crucial roles in innate immunity of vertebrates and invertebrates. In the present study, the cDNA of a C-type lectin with one carbohydrate-recognition domain (CRD) of 127 amino acids was cloned from bay scallop Argopecten irradians (designated AiCTL-3) by rapid amplification of cDNA end (RACE) techniques based on expressed sequence tag (EST) analysis. The mRNA transcripts of AiCTL-3 could be detected in all the tested tissues including hepatopancreas, gonad, adductor muscle, heart, hemocytes, mantle and gill, with the highest expression level in hepatopancreas. After the challenges with Vibrio anguillarum and Micrococcus luteus, the mRNA expression level of AiCTL-3 was obviously up-regulated and reached the maximum level at 9h (11.87fold, P<0.01, and 20.02-fold, P<0.05, respectively). The recombinant AiCTL-3 (designated as rAiCTL-3) could bind LPS, PGN, and glucan in vitro, but could not bind mannan. And it also bound Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus as well as Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli and V. anguillarum. With a Ca(2+) binding site 2 EPN (Glu-Pro-Asn) motif, rAiCTL-3 could bind both mannose and galactose which was quite different from those in vertebrate. Meanwhile, it could significantly enhance the phagocytosis of scallop hemocytes in vitro. The results clearly suggested that AiCTL-3 could serve not only as a PRR participated in the immune response against various PAMPs and bacteria in non-self recognition via mannose/galactose binding specificity but an opsonin playing an important part in clearance of invaders.
TI  - Characterization and recombinant protein expression of ferritin light chain homologue in the silkworm, Bombyx mori.
AB  - The silkworm genome encodes three iron storage proteins or ferritins, Fer1HCH, Fer2LCH, and Fer3HCH. Probing our EST library constructed from 1-day-old silkworm eggs revealed only Fer2LCH mRNA, which encoded for a protein with a predicted putative N-glycosylation site. Developmental and tissue expression analyses during embryogenesis revealed that Fer2LCH mRNA was abundant from 6 h to 6 days after oviposition. Transcriptional expression of Fer2LCH during the postembryonic stage is also high in the larval fat body and mid-gut, and then is upregulated in all pupal tissues tested. We found that Fer2LCH mRNA contains an iron-responsive element, suggesting this ferritin subunit is subject to translational control. Although ferritin expression has been shown to increase following immune challenge in other insects, the levels of Fer2LCH mRNA were not significantly induced following viral or bacterial infection of Bombyx mori. Using a baculovirus expression system we expressed recombinant BmFer2LCH protein, which was detectable in the cytoplasmic fraction, likely in a compartment of the secretory pathway, and was shown to undergo posttranslational modifications including N-glycosylation. In particular, rBmFer2LCH carbohydrate chains were composed of mannose and GlcNAc. We suggest that Fer2LCH is important for iron homeostasis and maintaining normal organ function in silkworms.
TI  - Antimicrobial effect of bayberry leaf extract for the preservation of large yellow croaker (Pseudosciaena crocea).
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chemical preservatives have been widely used to keep large yellow croaker fresh. However, the potential harm to human health cannot be ignored. This study was undertaken to investigate the antimicrobial effect of bayberry leaf extract and to evaluate the efficacy of this natural product on the preservation of large yellow croaker. RESULTS: The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of bayberry leaf extract against bacteria were 1.0 mg mL(-)(1) for Micrococcus luteus, 0.5 mg mL(-)(1) for Staphylococcus aureus, 0.25 mg mL(-)(1) for Escherichia coli, 0.5 mg mL(-)(1) for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 0.0625 mg mL(-)(1) for Vibrio parahaemolyticus, and 0.03125 mg mL(-)(1) for Listeria monocytogenes, respectively. This result was confirmed by the diameters of inhibition zone (DIZ) assay. Further studies showed that the bacterial growth was significantly retarded when large yellow croaker was pretreated with bayberry leaf extract (2 g L(-)(1)) compared to that in the control group. Moreover, the generation of total volatile basic nitrogenous compounds (TVB-N), ATP degradation products (K-value) and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) were significantly reduced compared to that in the control group. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated that the shelf life of large yellow croaker can be extended when supplemented with bayberry leaf extract, which might have implications for natural preservatives.
TI  - Cloning and heterologous expression of plnE, -F, -J and -K genes derived from soil metagenome and purification of active plantaricin peptides.
AB  - Plantaricin gene-specific primers were used to obtain plnE, -F, -J and -K structural gene amplicons from soil metagenome. These amplicons were cloned and expressed in pET32a (+) vector in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). PlnE, -F, -J and -K peptides were expressed as His-tagged-fusion proteins and were separated by Ni(2+) -chelating affinity chromatography. The peptides were released from the fusion by enterokinase cleavage and separated from the carrier thioredoxin. The cleaved peptides were further analysed for antimicrobial activity and found to be active against Listeria innocua NRRL B33314, Micrococcus luteus MTCC 106 and lactic acid bacteria, such as Enterococcus casseliflavus NRRL B3502, Lactococcus lactis lactis NRRL 1821, Lactobacillus curvatus NRRL B4562 and Lactobacillus plantarum NRRL B4496. E. coli has been successfully exploited as a host for heterologous expression with a significant yield of fused and cleaved peptides in the range of 8-12 and 1-1.5 mg/l of the culture, respectively. Heterologous expression, therefore, can be used to overcome the constraints of low yield often reported from a native strain.
TI  - Functional analysis of domain of unknown function (DUF) 1943, DUF1944 and von Willebrand factor type D domain (VWD) in vitellogenin2 in zebrafish.
AB  - Vitellogenin (Vg), the precursor of egg-yolk proteins in all oviparous organisms, shares a similar domain structure combination. In most cases, Vg contains the Vitellogenin_N domain, the domain of unknown function (DUF) 1943, and the von Willebrand factor type D domain (VWD), which are present in different forms of Vg from both vertebrates and invertebrates. Occasionally, a DUF1944 domain is also present in between DUF1943 and VWD in some Vg proteins of vertebrates. Recent studies have shown that Vg participates in immune defense of host with multiple functions. However, whether all Vg proteins encoded by different vg genes play an immune role is unknown. In addition, the correlation of different domains in Vg with the multiple immune functions remains completely unclear. Here we demonstrated clearly that recombinant proteins, rDUF1943, rDUF1944 and rVWD from zebrafish Vg2 interacted with both the Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis and Micrococcus luteus and the Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli and Vibrio anguillarum, as well as their signature components LTA and LPS. Moreover, both rDUF1943 and rDUF1944 promoted the phagocytosis of E. coli and S. aureus by carp macrophages. These suggest that both DUF1943 and DUF1944 as well as VWD may contribute to the function of Vg as a pattern recognition receptor, and DUF1943 and DUF1944 also contribute to the function of Vg as an opsonin. This study also opens a new angle for identification of function of genes of unknown function, which have the domains DUF1943 and DUF1944.
TI  - Cytotoxic, antioxidant, antimicrobial properties and chemical composition of rose petals.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rosa rugosa petals are used for production of teas, jams, wines and juices. Despite the wide availability of rose cultivars, comprehensive information on petal chemical composition and healthful properties is still lacking. Therefore, the aim of this study was analysis of cytotoxic, antioxidant and antimicrobial activity and chemical composition of rugosa rose petals. RESULTS: Petals of R. rugosa were evaluated for their cytotoxic effect against cervical (HeLa) and breast cancer (T47D) cell lines and for antiradical activity (with DPPH*). As a result, significant cytotoxic (up to 100% of dead cells) and antiradical properties (IC(5)(0) 1.33-0.08 mg mg(-)(1) DPPH*) were demonstrated. Moreover, notable antimicrobial activity against eight bacterial (i.e. Staphylococcus. epidermidis, S. aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis) and two yeast strains (Candida. albicans, C. parapsilosis) was shown. Total phenolic, flavonoid, phenolic acid, tannin, carotenoid and polysaccharide content in petals was determined using spectrophotometric methods. Liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry was used to thoroughly analyze phenolic acids and flavonoid glycosides in the methanolic extract and fractions obtained after its separation. Five phenolic acids and six flavonoids previously not reported in the plant material were identified. CONCLUSION: This is the first such detailed report on chemical composition and biological activity of R. rugosa petals.
TI  - Effective inhibition of bacterial respiration and growth by CuO microspheres composed of thin nanosheets.
AB  - This study describes the synthesis, characterization and biocidal potential of copper oxide micro-spheres composed of thin sheets (CuOMSs-Ths). Microscopic observations of synthesized CuOMSs-Ths revealed the clusters of thin sheets arranged in small flower like micro-spheres. Diameter of each micro-sphere was determined in the range of 2-3 mum, whereas the size of each sheet was approximately 80 nm. These micro-flowers like nanostructures were synthesized using copper nitrate hexahydrate and sodium hydroxide via solution process. The CuOMSs-Ths exhibited a broad-spectrum anti-bacterial activity involving significant growth inhibition of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Micrococcus luteus. The IC50 values of these engineered NPs against E. coli, P. aeruginosa, S. aureus and M. luteus were determined to be 195, 200, 131 and 184 mug/ml, respectively. Also, the respiration of Gram+ ve organisms (M. luteus and S. aureus) was inhibited significantly (p value < 0.005) at relatively lower concentrations of 12.5 and 50 mug/ml, respectively, as compared to the Gram- ve bacteria (E. coli and P. aeruginosa), where the growth inhibition occurred at a much greater concentration of 100 mug/ml. The results explicitly demonstrated anti-microbial activity of CuOMSs-Ths with a higher level of toxicity against the Gram+ ve vis-a-vis Gram- ve bacteria.
TI  - Antioxidant and antimicrobial properties of the essential oil and extracts of Zanthoxylum alatum grown in north-western Himalaya.
AB  - The essential oil obtained from the fresh leaves of Zanthoxylum alatum was analysed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Fourteen components were identified, and linalool (30.58%), 2-decanone (20.85%), beta -fenchol (9.43%), 2-tridecanone (8.86%), beta -phellandrene (5.99%), Sabinene (4.82%), and alpha -pinene (4.11%) were the main components. The EO and methanolic extract of Z. alatum exhibited potent antifungal activity against Alternaria alternata, Alternaria brassicae, and Curvularia lunata. The EO also showed significant antibacterial activity against Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli. Further, antimicrobial constituents of the EO were isolated by bioautography and preparative thin layer chromatography (PTLC) and identified as beta -fenchol and linalool using GC/MS analysis. In addition to this, the free radical scavenging activity and antioxidant potential of EO and methanolic extract/fractions of Z. alatum were also investigated using in vitro assays including scavenging ability against DPPH(*), reducing power and chelating ability on Fe(2+) ions. Our results demonstrate that Z. alatum could be used as a resource of antioxidant and antimicrobial compounds which may find applications in food and pesticide industries.
TI  - Immune competence in insect eggs depends on the extraembryonic serosa.
AB  - Innate immunity is common to all metazoans and serves as a first line of defense  against pathogens. Although the immune response of adult and larval insects has been well characterized, it remains unknown whether the insect egg is able to mount an immune response. Contrary to Drosophila, Tribolium eggs develop an extraembryonic epithelium, the serosa. Epithelia are well known for their ability to fight infection, so the serosa has the potential to protect the embryo against pathogens. To test this hypothesis we created serosa-less eggs by Tc-zen1 parental RNAi. We found that the Tribolium egg upregulates several immune genes to comparable levels as adults in response to infection. Drosophila eggs and serosa-less Tribolium eggs, however, show little to no upregulation of any of the tested immune genes. We conclude that the extraembryonic serosa is crucial for the early immune competence of the Tribolium egg.
TI  - cgMolluscidin, a novel dibasic residue repeat rich antimicrobial peptide, purified from the gill of the Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas.
AB  - A 5.5 kDa antimicrobial peptide consisting of 55 amino acids, cgMolluscidin, was  purified from the acidified gill extract of the Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas, by ion-exchange and C18 reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography. By comparing the N-terminal amino acid sequences and the molecular weight of this peptide with those of other known antimicrobial peptides, it has been revealed that this peptide had no homology with any known peptides. cgMolluscidin showed potent antimicrobial activity against both Gram-positive bacteria, including Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, and Staphylococcus aureus (minimal effective concentrations [MECs]; 1.3-31.3 mug/mL), and Gram-negative bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, and Vibrio parahaemolyticus ([MECs]; 0.4-2.3 mug/mL), without hemolytic activity. However, cgMolluscidin did not show any significant activity against Candida albicans. The deduced amino acid sequence of the cgMolluscidin showed no hit in public protein databases, while the nucleotide sequence had a 99% homology (E value = 0) with only the unknown ESTs sequenced by C. gigas EST project. Tissue distribution of the cgMolluscidin mRNA suggests that it is constitutively expressed as a mature form in a non-tissue-specific manner. The cgMolluscidin mRNA expression level was significantly up-regulated at 12 h (2.8-fold) post injection with Vibrio sp. This peptide is highly basic and contains several dibasic residue repeats including Lysine-Lysine or Lysine-Arginine in the sequence, but may not form an ordered structure. These results suggest that cgMolluscidin might be an oyster-specific novel antimicrobial peptide.
TI  - Engineering of Ralstonia eutropha H16 for autotrophic and heterotrophic production of methyl ketones.
AB  - Ralstonia eutropha is a facultatively chemolithoautotrophic bacterium able to grow with organic substrates or H2 and CO2 under aerobic conditions. Under conditions of nutrient imbalance, R. eutropha produces copious amounts of poly[(R)-3-hydroxybutyrate] (PHB). Its ability to utilize CO2 as a sole carbon source renders it an interesting new candidate host for the production of renewable liquid transportation fuels. We engineered R. eutropha for the production of fatty acid-derived, diesel-range methyl ketones. Modifications engineered in R. eutropha included overexpression of a cytoplasmic version of the TesA thioesterase, which led to a substantial (>150-fold) increase in fatty acid titer under certain conditions. In addition, deletion of two putative beta-oxidation operons and heterologous expression of three genes (the acyl coenzyme A oxidase gene from Micrococcus luteus and fadB and fadM from Escherichia coli) led to the production of 50 to 65 mg/liter of diesel-range methyl ketones under heterotrophic growth conditions and 50 to 180 mg/liter under chemolithoautotrophic growth conditions (with CO2 and H2 as the sole carbon source and electron donor, respectively). Induction of the methyl ketone pathway diverted substantial carbon flux away from PHB biosynthesis and appeared to enhance carbon flux through the pathway for biosynthesis of fatty acids, which are the precursors of methyl ketones.
TI  - Bacillus subtilis as a tool for screening soil metagenomic libraries for antimicrobial activities.
AB  - Finding new antimicrobial activities by functional metagenomics has been shown to depend on the heterologous host used to express the foreign DNA. Therefore, efforts are devoted to developing new tools for constructing metagenomic libraries in shuttle vectors replicatable in phylogenetically distinct hosts. Here we evaluated the use of the Escherichia coli-Bacillus subtilis shuttle vector pHT01 to construct a forest-soil metagenomic library. This library was screened in both hosts for antimicrobial activities against four opportunistic bacteria: Proteus vulgaris, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Micrococcus luteus. A new antibacterial activity against B. cereus was found upon screening in B. subtilis. The new antimicrobial agent, sensitive to proteinase K, was not active when the corresponding DNA fragment was expressed in E. coli. Our results validate the use of pHT01 as a shuttle vector and B. subtilis as a host to isolate new activities by functional metagenomics.
TI  - New sub-family of lysozyme-like proteins shows no catalytic activity: crystallographic and biochemical study of STM3605 protein from Salmonella Typhimurium.
AB  - Phage viruses that infect prokaryotes integrate their genome into the host chromosome; thus, microbial genomes typically contain genetic remnants of both recent and ancient phage infections. Often phage genes occur in clusters of atypical G+C content that reflect integration of the foreign DNA. However, some phage genes occur in isolation without other phage gene neighbors, probably resulting from horizontal gene transfer. In these cases, the phage gene product is unlikely to function as a component of a mature phage particle, and instead may have been co-opted by the host for its own benefit. The product of one such gene from Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, STM3605, encodes a protein with modest sequence similarity to phage-like lysozyme (N-acetylmuramidase) but appears to lack essential catalytic residues that are strictly conserved in all lysozymes. Close homologs in other bacteria share this characteristic. The structure of the STM3605 protein was characterized by X-ray crystallography, and functional assays showed that it is a stable, folded protein whose structure closely resembles lysozyme. However, this protein is unlikely to hydrolyze peptidoglycan. Instead, STM3605 is presumed to have evolved an alternative function because it shows some lytic activity and partitions to micelles.
TI  - Insights into the different functions of multiple peptidoglycan recognition proteins in the immune response against bacteria in the mosquito, Armigeres subalbatus.
AB  - Peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRPs) are a group of proteins that recognize and/or bind to peptidoglycan on the surface of a number of pathogens. To understand the roles of multiple PGRPs in the mosquito Armigeres subalbatus (AsPGRPs), we studied the effects of infection of two bacteria, the gram negative Escherichia coli and the gram positive Micrococcus luteus, on the transcriptional expression of AsPGRPs and RNA interference (RNAi) of AsPGRPs on the immune responses of mosquitoes against the two bacteria. Injection of E. coli or M. luteus into adult mosquitoes both significantly increased the transcription of AsPGRP-S1, but not the other AsPGRPs. A mosquito survival assay using injection of E. coli or M. luteus into AsPGRP double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) injected mosquitoes showed that RNAi of AsPGRPs had different impacts on the survival abilities of mosquitoes, and that AsPGRP-LCs seem to be the most critical ones. Real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (real-time PCR) analysis indicated that the expression of four antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) was dramatically changed after AsPGRP-LB and AsPGRP-LC RNAi, although AsPGRP-S1 and AsPGRP-LE had slight, but significant, effects, suggesting that the changes in survival abilities were potentially due to the changes in AMP expression after AsPGRP RNAi. In addition, bacterial challenges following AsPGRP-LC RNAi did not induce the expression of AMPs to their normal level as in control experiments. An in vivo assay indicated that AsPGRP-LC RNAi had no significant effects on the phagocytic ability of the hemocytes, suggesting that AsPGRP-LC is not a key factor mediating phagocytosis of bacteria in this mosquito.
TI  - Phenolic Content, Antioxidant Activity, Antibacterial Activity and Phytochemical  Composition of Garcinia lancifolia.
AB  - Garcinia lancifolia (Clusiaceae) is an unexplored medicinal plant used as stomachic, diuretic and its fruit is used to cure dysentery and diarrhoea. The acidic fruits are used to prepare juice, pickle and curries. The phytochemical analysis of different extracts of G. lancifolia leaf, stem and fruit revealed the presence of tannins, saponins, flavonoids, terpenoids, alkaloids and cardiac glycosides. The high phenolic content was observed in the methanol extract of leaf followed by methanol extract of stem and dichloromethane extract of leaf. The G. lancifolia fruit juice exhibited high antibacterial activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, Streptococcus mutans, Bacillus mycoides and Bacillus subtilis. The methanol extract of fruit pulp was also very effective against Gram-positive bacteria when compared with Gram-negative bacteria. The radical scavenging activity of 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl was highest in fruit juice followed by methanol extract of leaf and stem. All extracts showed concentration-dependent increase in the antioxidant activity.
TI  - New alkaloid from Streptomyces koyangensis residing in Odontotermes formosanus.
AB  - A new alkaloid was isolated from the ethyl acetate extract of the culture of a termite-associated Streptomyces koyangensis BY-4. The structure of 1 was elucidated by using MS, NMR, electronic circular dichroism data, and computational approaches. Compound 1 showed weak antimicrobial activities against a panel of test microbes.
TI  - A four-CRD C-type lectin from Chlamys farreri mediating nonself-recognition with  broader spectrum and opsonization.
AB  - C-type lectins are a superfamily of Ca(2+)-dependent carbohydrate-recognition proteins consisting of at least one carbohydrate-recognition domain (CRD), which participate in nonself-recognition and clearance of invaders. In invertebrate, some multidomain C-type lectins have been identified, but their relative functions and binding mechanism are still meager. In the present study, A C-type lectin (CfLec-4) with four CRDs from Chlamys farreri was selected to investigate its possible function in innate immunity. The mRNA expression of CfLec-4 in hemocytes was significantly up-regulated (P<0.01) after the stimulations of beta-glucan, LPS or PGN, and reached the highest expression level at 3, 6, 12 h post-stimulation, which was 27.9-, 22.6- or 47.9-fold of that in blank group, respectively. Immunohistochemistry assay with polyclonal antibody specific for CfLec-4 revealed that the endogenous CfLec-4 was mainly located in the hepatopancreas, kidney and gonad of the scallops. The recombinant CfLec-4 (rCflec-4) could bind LPS, PGN, glucan and mannose in vitro, but could not bind LTA. Furthermore, rCflec-4 displayed a broader bacteria binding spectrum towards Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus and Micrococcus luteus as well as Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli, Vibrio anguillarum and fungi Pichia pastoris. Meanwhile, rCfLec-4 could significantly (P<0.01) enhance the phagocytosis of hemocytes in vitro. The results clearly suggested that four-CRD containing CfLec-4 not only served as PRR with wider recognition spectrum, but also functioned as an opsonin participating in the clearance of invaders in scallops. It could be inferred that the diversity and complexity of CRDs in C-type lectins endowed these receptors with comprehensive recognition spectrum and multiple immune functions against complex living environment.
TI  - Bacteriolytic activity of human interleukin-2.
AB  - In this paper we report the discovery of bacteriolytic activity of an immune system cytokine mediator, interleukin-2. Bacteriolytic activity of interleukin-2 was compared with a well-known bacteriolytic enzyme - chicken egg white lysozyme - by monitoring the lysis of the Gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli, the Gram-positive coccus Micrococcus luteus, and the Gram-positive spore-forming bacillus Bacillus subtilis. It was found that interleukin-2 has greater specificity to the Gram-negative bacterium E. coli than does lysozyme. In contrast to chicken egg white lysozyme, interleukin-2 does not lyse the Gram-positive coccus M. luteus and the Gram-positive spore-forming bacillus B. subtilis. These results give a new understanding of the biological functions of interleukin-2, a regulatory protein that plays a role in oncological and infectious diseases.
TI  - Diversity of the bacterial and fungal microflora from the midgut and cuticle of phlebotomine sand flies collected in North-Western Iran.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Phlebotomine sand flies are the vectors of the leishmaniases, parasitic diseases caused by Leishmania spp. Little is known about the prevalence and diversity of sand fly microflora colonizing the midgut or the cuticle. Particularly, there is little information on the fungal diversity. This information is important for development of vector control strategies. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: FIVE SAND FLY SPECIES: Phlebotomus papatasi, P. sergenti, P. kandelakii, P. perfiliewi and P. halepensis were caught in Bileh Savar and Kaleybar in North-Western Iran that are located in endemic foci of visceral leishmaniasis. A total of 35 specimens were processed. Bacterial and fungal strains were identified by routine microbiological methods. We characterized 39 fungal isolates from the cuticle and/or the midgut. They belong to six different genera including Penicillium (17 isolates), Aspergillus (14), Acremonium (5), Fusarium (1), Geotrichum (1) and Candida (1). We identified 33 Gram-negative bacteria: Serratia marcescens (9 isolates), Enterobacter cloacae (6), Pseudomonas fluorescens (6), Klebsiella ozaenae (4), Acinetobacter sp. (3), Escherichia coli (3), Asaia sp. (1) and Pantoea sp. (1) as well as Gram-positive bacteria Bacillus subtilis (5) and Micrococcus luteus (5) in 10 isolates. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Our study provides new data on the microbiotic diversity of field-collected sand flies and for the first time, evidence of the presence of Asaia sp. in sand flies. We have also found a link between physiological stages (unfed, fresh fed, semi gravid and gravid) of sand flies and number of bacteria that they carry. Interestingly Pantoea sp. and Klebsiella ozaenae have been isolated in Old World sand fly species. The presence of latter species on sand fly cuticle and in the female midgut suggests a role for this arthropod in dissemination of these pathogenic bacteria in endemic areas. Further experiments are required to clearly delineate the vectorial role (passive or active) of sand flies.
TI  - [Synthesis and antimicrobial ivestigation of 8-quinolinols glucosaminides].
AB  - In the phase transfer system solid calcium carbonate--acetonitrile per acetylated O-beta-D-glucosaminides of 8-quinolinol, 2-methyl-8-quinolinol and 5-chloro-8-quinolinol were synthesized. Zemplen deacetylation was led to corresponding trioles. Obtained O-beta-D-glucosaminides were identified with 1H-NMR spectroscopy. Antimicrobial activity of deacetylated forms has been studied in a test of inhibition of bioluminescence of marine luminescent bacteria Vibrio fischeri F1 and method of the serial breeding on the museum steams of Escherichia coli, Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Bacillus cereus, Micrococcus luteus. It was established that glycosylation decrease antimicrobial activity in comparison with non-glycosilated 8-quinolinols.
TI  - Antifungal peptides homologous to the Penicillium chrysogenum antifungal protein  (PAF) are widespread among Fusaria.
AB  - Putative antifungal peptide encoding genes containing Penicillium chrysogenum antifungal protein (PAF) characteristic amino acid motifs were identified in 15 Fusarium isolates, representing 10 species. Based on the predicted sequences of mature peptides, discrepancy in one, two or three amino acids was observed between them. Phylogenetic investigations revealed that they show high amino acid sequence similarity to PAF and they belong to the group of fungal derived antifungal peptides with PAF-cluster. Ten from the 15 partially purified <10 kDa peptide fraction of Fusarium ferment broths showed antifungal activity. The presence of approximately 6.3 kDa molecular weight peptides was detected in all of the antifungally active ferment broths, and this peptide was isolated and purified from Fusarium polyphilaidicum. The minimal inhibitiory concentrations of F. polyphilaidicum antifungal protein (FPAP) were determined against different filamentous fungi, yeasts and bacteria. Filamentous fungal species were the most susceptible to FPAF, but some yeasts were also slightly sensitive.
TI  - Expansion of the antimicrobial peptide repertoire in the invasive ladybird Harmonia axyridis.
AB  - The harlequin ladybird beetle Harmonia axyridis has emerged as a model species in invasion biology because of its strong resistance against pathogens and remarkable capacity to outcompete native ladybirds. The invasive success of the species may reflect its well-adapted immune system, a hypothesis we tested by analysing the transcriptome and characterizing the immune gene repertoire of untreated beetles and those challenged with bacteria and fungi. We found that most H. axyridis immunity-related genes were similar in diversity to their counterparts in the reference beetle Tribolium castaneum, but there was an unprecedented expansion among genes encoding antimicrobial peptides and proteins (AMPs). We identified more than 50 putative AMPs belonging to seven different gene families, and many of the corresponding genes were shown by quantitative real-time RT-PCR to be induced in the immune-stimulated beetles. AMPs with the highest induction ratio in the challenged beetles were shown to demonstrate broad and potent activity against Gram-negative bacteria and entomopathogenic fungi. The invasive success of H. axyridis can therefore be attributed at least in part to the greater efficiency of its immune system, particularly the expansion of AMP gene families and their induction in response to pathogens.
TI  - Comparative evaluation of herbs and spices against bacterial pathogens.
AB  
TI  - Resuscitation promoting factor (Rpf) from Tomitella biformata AHU 1821(T) promotes growth and resuscitates non-dividing cells.
AB  - Functional variation of Rpf, a growth factor found exclusively in Actinobacteria, is differentiated by its source and amino acid sequences. Only purified Rpf proteins from three species have been studied so far. To seek new Rpfs for use in future studies to understand their role in Actinobacteria, the objective of this study was to identify rpf gene homologs in Tomitella biformata AHU 1821(T), a novel Actinobacteria isolated from permafrost ice wedge. Amplification using degenerate primers targeting the essential Rpf domain led to the discovery of a new rpf gene in T. biformata. Gene structure and the deduced Rpf domain amino acid sequence indicated that this rpf gene was not identical to previously studied Rpf. Phylogenetic analysis placed T. biformata Rpf in a monophyletic branch in the RpfB subfamily. The deduced amino acid sequence was 44.9% identical to RpfB in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the closest functionally tested Rpf. The gene was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli; the recombinant Rpf protein (rRpf) promoted the growth of dividing cells and resuscitated non-dividing cells of T. biformata. Compared to other studies, this Rpf was required at higher concentrations to promote its growth and to resuscitate itself from a non-dividing state. The resuscitation function was likely due to the highly conserved Rpf domain. This study provides evidence that a genetically unique but functional Rpf can be found in novel members of Actinobacteria and can lead to a better understanding of bacterial cytokines in this phylum.
TI  - Pyramidamycins A-D and 3-hydroxyquinoline-2-carboxamide; cytotoxic benzamides from Streptomyces sp. DGC1.
AB  - Four new benzamides, pyramidamycins A-D (2-5) along with the new natural 3-hydroxyquinoline-2-carboxamide (6) were isolated from the crude extract of Streptomyces sp. DGC1. Additionally, five other known compounds, namely 2-aminobenzamide (anthranilamide) (1), 4',7-dihydroxyisoflavanone (7), 2'-deoxy-thymidine, 2'-deoxy-uridine and adenosine were also isolated and identified. The structures of the new compounds 2-6 were elucidated by 1D and 2D NMR studies along with HR MS analyses. The isolated compounds 1-6 contained the same amide side chain. The isolated compounds 1-7 were biologically evaluated in comparison with landomycin A against a prostate cancer cell line (PC3) and non-small cell lung cancer cell line (H460) for 48 h and against several bacterial strains. Pyramidamycin C (4) was the most active compound against both PC3 and H460 cell lines (GI(50)=2.473 and 7.339 muM, respectively). Benzamides (1-3) demonstrated inhibitory activity against Kocuria rosea B-1106 (a diameter halo of 13+/-2 mm for 1; 10+/-2 mm for 2 and 3). Compound 6 was slightly active against both Escherichia coli DH5alpha and Micrococcus luteus NRRL B-2618 (diameter halos 8+/-2 and 9+/-2 mm, respectively). Taxonomically, the amplified 500-bp 16 S rRNA fragment of the Streptomyces sp. DGC1 had 99% identity (BLAST search) to the 16S rRNA gene of Streptomyces atrovirens strain NRRL B-16357.
TI  - Development of bacteria identification array to detect lactobacilli in Thai fermented sausage.
AB  - To improve the quality and safety of food products, there is a need in the food industry for a reliable method for simultaneously monitoring multiple bacterial strains. Microarray technology is a high-throughput screening approach that can provide an alternative for bacteria detection. A total of 164 bacteria-specific probes were designed from 16S rRNA gene sequences to target 12 bacteria species, including lactic acid bacteria and selected food pathogens. After fabrication onto aminosilane-coated slides, hybridization conditions of the array were optimized for high specificity and signal intensities. The array was applied to detect 12 bacteria individually and was specific to all (Lactobacillus plantarum group, L. fermentum, L. brevis, L. delbrueckii, L. casei, L. sakei, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Micrococcus luteus and Listeria monocytogenes) except L. animalis. Multiplex detection using mixed bacteria populations was evaluated and accurate detection was obtained. The feasibility of using the array to detect the target bacteria in food was evaluated with Thai fermented sausages (Nham). Meat samples were collected on days 2, 3 and 7 after natural fermentation, L. plantarum-inoculated fermentation and L. brevis-inoculated fermentation before applying to the array. The naturally-fermented Nham contained L. sakei, L. delbrueckii, L. plantarum and L. fermentum. The L. plantarum-inoculated Nham showed a similar lactic acid bacteria population but the positive signal level for L. plantarum was higher than with natural fermentation. The L. brevis-inoculated Nham contained L. brevis, L. plantarum, L. delbrueckii and L. fermentum. The array was used to monitor bacteria population dynamics during the fermentation process. The naturally-fermented and L. brevis-inoculated samples showed lower positive signal levels of L. plantarum on day 2, but signals gradually increased on days 3 and 7 of the fermentation. In contrast, the L. plantarum-started fermentation showed a higher positive signal level on day 2 than the natural and L. brevis-inoculated samples, and the positive signal level remained high on days 3 and 7. The bacteria identification array was proven to be useful as an alternative method to detect and monitor target bacteria populations during food fermentation.
TI  - Unraveling the antifungal activity of a South American rattlesnake toxin crotamine.
AB  - Crotamine is a highly basic peptide from the venom of Crotalus durissus terrificus rattlesnake. Its common gene ancestry and structural similarity with the beta-defensins, mainly due to an identical disulfide bond pattern, stimulated us to assess the antimicrobial properties of native, recombinant, and chemically synthesized crotamine. Antimicrobial activities against standard strains and clinical isolates were analyzed by the colorimetric microdilution method showing a weak antibacterial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria [MIC (Minimum Inhibitory Concentration) of 50->200 mug/mL], with the exception of Micrococcus luteus [MIC ranging from 1 to 2 mug/mL]. No detectable activity was observed for the filamentous fungus Aspergillus fumigatus and Trichophyton rubrum at concentrations up to 125 mug/mL. However, a pronounced antifungal activity against Candida spp., Trichosporon spp., and Cryptococcus neoformans [12.5-50.0 mug/mL] was observed. Chemically produced synthetic crotamine in general displayed MIC values similar to those observed for native crotamine, whereas recombinant crotamine was overridingly more potent in most assays. On the other hand, derived short linear peptides were not very effective apart from a few exceptions. Pronounced ultrastructure alteration in Candida albicans elicited by crotamine was observed by electron microscopy analyses. The peculiar specificity for highly proliferating cells was confirmed here showing potential low cytotoxic effect of crotamine against nontumoral mammal cell lines (HEK293, PC12, and primary culture astrocyte cells) compared to tumoral B16F10 cells, and no hemolytic activity was observed. Taken together these results suggest that, at low concentration, crotamine is a potentially valuable anti-yeast or candicidal agent, with low harmful effects on normal mammal cells, justifying further studies on its mechanisms of action aiming medical and industrial applications.
TI  - Effects of parabens and isothiazolinone on the microbiological quality of baby shampoo: the challenge test.
AB  - An in vitro microbial challenge test has been developed to predict the likelihood of consumer contamination of baby shampoo. Four preservatives were tested in our study: the parbens Medcide D, Medcide PB, Sepicide HB. and isothiazolinone Methylisothiazolinone/Chloromethylisothiazolinone [MI/MCI]. These preservatives were tested separately and in combination. The challenge test involved inoculating the product with Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Aspergillus brasiliensis and Candida albicans. Inhibition growth of these microorganisms at each preservative concentration was followed over a 28 d period. The test was used to classify products as poorly preserved, marginally preserved, or well-preserved. Interestingly, it was the combination (0.1% Isothiazolinone [MI/MCI] and 0.1% Sepicide HB) which inhibited most the microbial growth of microorganims while preserving the physicochemical properties of the product. As a result, the challenge test described can be accurately used to predict the risk of consumer contamination of cosmetic products.
TI  - [Bacteriolytic enzymes of blood plasma from sheep].
AB  - In the present work the studies ofbacteriolytic factors from sheep blood plasma have been performed. Three novel enzymes have been identified and characterized. Two of them have a molecular weight 15 +/- 2 kDa and able to lyse the gram-negative Escherichia coli bacteria. The third enzyme has a molecular weight 34 +/- 4 kDa and is able to lyse both gram-negative Escherichia coli and gram-positive Micrococcus luteus bacteria. The bacteriolytic reactions have been studied for all three enzymes; particularly, pH-optima have been identified with respect to the substrate. To identify the enzymes trypsinolysis and consequent MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry studies were performed. The results were compared to data from publicly available databases, such as Swiss-Prot, NCBI, MSDB.
TI  - A novel methylated sesquiterpene from seagrass Posidonia oceanica (L.) Delile.
AB  - Phytochemical investigation of chloroform extract from the leaves of the marine plant Posidonia oceanica (L.) Delile (Posidoniaceae), yielded posidozinol, a new methylated sesquiterpene along with beta-sitosterol and four known fatty acids: palmitic, palmitoleic, oleic and linoleic acids. The structure elucidation has been established on the basis of 1D- and 2D-NMR spectroscopy, GS/MS and ES mass spectrometry. Antibacterial effects of crude extracts from P. oceanica were evaluated against: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Micrococcus luteus microorganisms.
TI  - A novel antibacterial and antifungal phenolic compound from the endophytic fungus Pestalotiopsis mangiferae.
AB  - A novel phenolic compound, 4-(2,4,7-trioxa-bicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-3-yl) phenol (1), was isolated from Pestalotiopsis mangiferae, an endophytic fungus associated with Mangifera indica Linn. The structure of the compound was elucidated on the basis of comprehensive spectral analysis (UV, IR, (1)H-, (1)(3)C- and 2D-NMR, as well as HRESI-MS). Compound (1) shows potent antibacterial and antifungal activity against Bacillus subtilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans. The transmission electron microscope study for the mode of inhibition of compound (1) on bacterial pathogens revealed the destruction of bacterial cells by cytoplasm agglutination with the formation of pores in cell wall membranes.
TI  - Antibacterial effect of phosphates and polyphosphates with different chain length.
AB  - The aim of this study was to monitor the antibacterial effect of seven phosphate  salts on selected strains of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, which could be considered responsible for food-borne diseases (Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Citrobacter freundii, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella enterica ser. Enteritidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). For these purposes, phosphates differing in chain length were used. The tested concentrations were in the range of 0.1-2.0% (wt v(-1)) applied at the model conditions. In the majority of cases the visible inhibitory effect on the growth of observed microorganisms could be seen. Due to the chemical structure of salts and their dissociation both the pH values of cultivation broth and similarly the growth characteristics of bacterial strains were affected. The inhibition of above mentioned bacteria was apparently supported by this dissociation. Phosphates obviously made the development of most Gram-positive bacteria impossible. Especially Micrococcus luteus was extremely sensitive to the presence of these substances. On the other hand, Gram-negative bacteria seemed to be resistant to the phosphate incidence. The exemption clause from the tested salts was represented by a high alkaline trisodium phosphate. It should be pointed out that generally the most significant antibacterial effects were shown by polyphosphates HEXA68 and HEXA70, trisodium phosphate undecahydrate, tetrasodium pyrophosphate and finally trisodium phosphate. By comparing the inhibitory effects of various phosphate salts can be concluded that the antibacterial activity was not determined only by the condensation degree but there was also proved the dependence on pH values.
TI  - An improved implementation of effective number of codons (nc).
AB  - The effective number of codons (N(c)) is a widely used index for characterizing codon usage bias because it does not require a set of reference genes as does codon adaptation index (CAI) and because of the freely available computational tools such as CodonW. However, N(c), as originally formulated has many problems. For example, it can have values far greater than the number of sense codons; it treats a 6-fold compound codon family as a single-codon family although it is made of a 2-fold and a 4-fold codon family that can be under dramatically different selection for codon usage bias; the existing implementations do not handle all different genetic codes; it is often biased by codon families with a small number of codons. We developed a new N(c) that has a number of advantages over the original N(c). Its maximum value equals the number of sense codons when all synonymous codons are used equally, and its minimum value equals the number of codon families when exactly one codon is used in each synonymous codon family. It handles all known genetic codes. It breaks the compound codon families (e.g., those involving amino acids coded by six synonymous codons) into 2-fold and 4-fold codon families. It reduces the effect of codon families with few codons by introducing pseudocount and weighted averages. The new N(c) has significantly improved correlation with CAI than the original N(c) from CodonW based on protein-coding genes from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, and Mycoplasma genitalium. It also correlates better with protein abundance data from the yeast than the original N(c).
TI  - The constituents of essential oil: antimicrobial and antioxidant activity of Micromeria congesta Boiss. & Hausskn. ex Boiss. from East Anatolia.
AB  - The chemical composition, antimicrobial activity, total phenol content, total antioxidant activity, and total oxidant status of the essential oil from Micromeria congesta Boiss. & Hausskn. ex Boiss. were investigated. Steam distillation was used to obtain the essential oil, and the chemical analyses were performed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The antimicrobial activity was tested by an agar disc diffusion method against the tested microorganisms: Bacillus subtilis NRRL B-744, Bacillus cereus NRRL B-3711, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 12598, S. aureus ATCC 25923, S. aureus ATCC 25933, Escherichia coli 0157H7, E. coli ATCC25922, Micrococcus luteus NRLL B-4375, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 19433, Proteus vulgaris RSKK 96026, and Yersinia enterecolitica RSKK 1501. The major compounds found in volatiles of M. congesta were piperitone oxide, linalool oxide, veratrole, pulegone, dihydro carvone, naphthalene, iso-menthone, para-menthone, and cyclohexanone. Compared to that of reference antibiotics, the antibacterial activity of the essential oil is considered as significant. Results showed that M. congesta has the potential for being used in food and medicine depending on its antioxidant and antibacterial activity.
TI  - Intracellular toxicity of proline-rich antimicrobial peptides shuttled into mammalian cells by the cell-penetrating peptide penetratin.
AB  - The health threat caused by multiresistant bacteria has continuously increased and recently peaked with pathogens resistant to all current drugs. This has triggered intense research efforts to develop novel compounds to overcome the resistance mechanisms. Thus, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have been intensively studied, especially the family of proline-rich AMPs (PrAMPs) that was successfully tested very recently in murine infection models. PrAMPs enter bacteria and inhibit chaperone DnaK. Here, we studied the toxicity of intracellular PrAMPs in HeLa and SH-SY5Y cells. As PrAMPs cannot enter most mammalian cells, we coupled the PrAMPs with penetratin (residues 43 to 58 in the antennapedia homeodomain) via a C-terminally added cysteine utilizing a thioether bridge. The resulting construct could transport the covalently linked PrAMP into mammalian cells. Penetratin ligation reduced the MIC for Gram-negative Escherichia coli only slightly (1 to 8 mumol/liter) but increased the activity against the Gram-positive Micrococcus luteus up to 32-fold (MIC approximately 1 mumol/liter), most likely due to more effective penetration through the bacterial membrane. In contrast to native PrAMPs, the penetratin-PrAMP constructs entered the mammalian cells, aligned around the nucleus, and associated with the Golgi apparatus. At higher concentrations, the constructs reduced the cell viability (50% inhibitory concentration [IC(50)] approximately 40 mumol/liter) and changed the morphology of the cells. No toxic effects or morphological changes were observed at concentrations of 10 mumol/liter or below. Thus, the IC(50) values were around 5 to 40 times higher than the MIC values. In conclusion, PrAMPs are in general not toxic to mammalian cells, as they do not pass through the membrane. When shuttled into mammalian cells, however, PrAMPs are only slightly cross-reactive to mammalian chaperones or other intracellular mammalian proteins, providing a second layer of safety for in vivo applications, even if they can enter some human cells.
TI  - Combining in the melt physical and biological properties of poly(caprolactone) and chlorhexidine to obtain antimicrobial surgical monofilaments.
AB  - Bacterial infections on a sutured wound represent a critical problem, and the preparation of suture threads possessing antimicrobial properties is valuable. In this work, poly(caprolactone) (PCL) monofilaments were compounded at the concentration of 1, 2 and 4 % (w/w), respectively, to the antiseptic chlorhexidine diacetate (CHX). The incorporation was carried out in the melt by a single-step methodology, i.e. "online" approach. Mechanical tests revealed that the incorporation of CHX does not significantly change tensile properties of PCL fibres as the thermal profile adopted to prepare the compounded fibres does not compromise the antibacterial activity of CHX. In fact, CHX confers to compounded PCL fibres' antimicrobial property even at the lowest CHX concentration as revealed by microbiological assays performed on Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus and Bacillus subtilis strains. The scanning electron microscope micrographs and energy-dispersive X-ray analysis of compounded threads revealed that CHX is uniformly distributed on fibre surface and that the overall amount of superficial CHX increases by increasing compounded CHX concentration. This distribution determines a biphasic CHX release kinetics characterized by an initial rapid solubilisation of superficial CHX micro-crystals, followed by a slow and gradual release of CHX incorporated in the bulk. Interestingly, the compounded threads did not show any toxic effect compromising cell viability of human fibroblasts in vitro, differently from that observed using an equal amount of pure CHX. Thus, this study originally demonstrated the effectiveness of an "online" approach to confer antimicrobial properties to an organic thermoplastic polymeric material commonly used for medical devices.
TI  - Tissue-enriched expression profiles in Aedes aegypti identify hemocyte-specific transcriptome responses to infection.
AB  - Hemocytes are integral components of mosquito immune mechanisms such as phagocytosis, melanization, and production of antimicrobial peptides. However, our understanding of hemocyte-specific molecular processes and their contribution to shaping the host immune response remains limited. To better understand the immunophysiological features distinctive of hemocytes, we conducted genome-wide analysis of hemocyte-enriched transcripts, and examined how tissue-enriched expression patterns change with the immune status of the host. Our microarray data indicate that the hemocyte-enriched trascriptome is dynamic and context-dependent. Analysis of transcripts enriched after bacterial challenge in circulating hemocytes with respect to carcass added a dimension to evaluating infection-responsive genes and immune-related gene families. We resolved patterns of transcriptional change unique to hemocytes from those that are likely shared by other immune responsive tissues, and identified clusters of genes preferentially induced in hemocytes, likely reflecting their involvement in cell type specific functions. In addition, the study revealed conserved hemocyte-enriched molecular repertoires, which might be implicated in core hemocyte function by cross-species meta-analysis of microarray expression data from Anopheles gambiae and Drosophila melanogaster.
TI  - An integrin from shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei mediated microbial agglutination and cell proliferation.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Integrins are a family of adhesion receptors which regulate cell proliferation, differentiation, leukocyte migration, and complement receptor-dependent phagocytosis. In invertebrates, as a cell adhesion receptor, beta integrins play an important role for the balanced activation of immune defense responses especially during the encounter of infections. The present study attempts to characterize the immune functions of shrimp integrin (LvIntegrin) to have better understanding on the immune system and its regulation mechanisms in shrimps. METHODOLOGY: A shrimp integrin was identified from the Pacific white shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei (designated as LvIntegrin). Its full-length cDNA was of 2621 bp with an open reading frame (ORF) of 2439 bp encoding a polypeptide of 812 amino acids. The mRNA expression of LvIntegrin was significantly up-regulated at 3, 6 and 12 h after Listonella anguillarum challenge. The cDNA fragment encoding beta integrin domains (betaA and hybrid domain) of LvIntegrin was recombined and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)-pLysS. The recombinant protein (rLvIntegrin) could significantly agglutinate the tested microbe including E. coli JM109, L. anguillarum, Micrococcus luteus and Candida dattiladattila in the presence of divalent cations. Moreover, when NIH3T3 cells were cultured with rLvIntegrin, the proliferation rate increased significantly in a dose-dependent manner. CONCLUSIONS: LvIntegrin, a shrimp beta integrin was identified from L. vannamei, shared several highly conserved features. LvIntegrin exhibited broad-spectrum agglutination activity towards both bacteria and fungi and could improve the proliferation of NIH3T3 cells, indicating that LvIntegrin is involved in the immune response against microbe challenge and regulation of cell proliferation as a cell adhesion receptor in shrimp.
TI  - Purification and characterization of YFGAP, a GAPDH-related novel antimicrobial peptide, from the skin of yellowfin tuna, Thunnus albacares.
AB  - A 3.4 kDa of antimicrobial peptide was purified from an acidified skin extract of the yellowfin tuna, Thunnus albacares, by preparative acid-urea-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and C(18) reversed-phase HPLC. A comparison of the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified peptide with that of other known polypeptides revealed high homology with the N-terminus of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH); thus, this peptide was designated as the yellowfin tuna GAPDH-related antimicrobial peptide (YFGAP). YFGAP showed potent antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria, such as Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, and Streptococcus iniae (minimal effective concentrations [MECs], 1.2-17.0 mug/mL), and Gram-negative bacteria, such as Aeromonas hydrophila, Escherichia coli D31, and Vibrio parahaemolyticus (MECs, 3.1-12.0 mug/mL) without significant hemolytic activity. According to the secondary structural prediction and the homology modeling, this peptide forms an amphipathic structure and consists of three secondary structural motifs including one alpha-helix and two parallel beta-strands. This peptide did not show membrane permeabilization ability and its activity was bacteriostatic rather than bactericidal. This is the first report of the isolation of an antimicrobial peptide from a tuna species and the first description of the antimicrobial function of the N-terminus of GAPDH of an animal species.
TI  - Involvement of NF-kappaB transcription factors in antimicrobial peptide gene induction in the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum.
AB  - We previously demonstrated that Tribolium castaneum antimicrobical peptide (AMP)  genes can be classified to IMD-dependent group I, Toll-dependent group III and co-dependent group II genes besides non-inducible group IV. Here, we focused on NF-kappaB transcription factor genes, Dif1, Dif2 and Rel, and examined their functions in AMP gene induction as well as linkages to the Toll or IMD pathway. IMD-dependent group I and Toll-dependent group III genes were revealed to be Rel- and Dif-dependent respectively through knockdown experiments, indicating that the pathway specificity of NF-kappaB classes found in Drosophila is also conserved in T. castaneum. The Toll-Dif and IMD-Rel pathways of T. castaneum were activated concomitantly by single microbe species, which may represent a distinctive feature of its immune responses. In addition, Rel knockdown impaired host defense against two model bacterial pathogens. Finally, potential kappaB motifs were searched in the regulatory regions of AMP genes, and relevance to respective NF-kappaB transcription factors was discussed.
TI  - Antibacterial activities of polyethylene glycol, tween 80 and sodium dodecyl sulphate coated silver nanoparticles in normal and multi-drug resistant bacteria.
AB  - Antibacterial activity of silver nanoparticles coated with different functionalizing agents i.e., polyethylene glycol, tween 80 and sodium dodecyl sulphate were evaluated on both normal and multi-drug resistant strains of bacteria. Under the same reaction conditions, these functionalizing agents were added separately to coat silver nanoparticles. Among these, polyethylene glycol coated nanoparticles were most effective in killing all the bacterial strains which includes Escherichia coli DH5a, Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus and multi-drug resistant clinical isolates of Shigella spp. (flexneri, boydii, sohnea) and Vibrio cholerae. The minimum inhibitory concentration of polyethylene glycol coated silver nanoparticles was also less compared to the other two sets of nanoparticles. Consistence with that polyethylene glycol coated nanoparticles produced more intracellular reactive oxygen species in bacteria. Moreover, when human cell lines MCF7 and Chang Liver were incubated in presence of these nanoparticles for 18 h with same concentrations as used for bacteria, no toxicity was observed. But significant increase in cell killing was observed with longer incubation time. Thus our present investigation implicates the potential therapeutic use of silver nanoparticles as antibacterial agent particularly the polyethylene glycol coated one.
TI  - Identification of a new Bacillus licheniformis strain producing a bacteriocin-like substance.
AB  - The emergence of antibiotic resistance has spurred a great number of studies for  development of new antimicrobials in the past decade. The purpose of this study was to screen environmental samples for Bacillus strains producing potent antimicrobial agents. A new strain, which showed strong antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella enterica ser. Pullorum, was isolated from soil and designated as B116. This new isolate was identified as Bacillus licheniformis by morphological, biochemical and genetic analyses. The production of bacteriocin-like substance (BLS) started at early exponential phase and achieved highest level at early stationary phase. The BLS was precipitated by ammonium sulfate and its molecular mass was determined as approximately 4 kDa by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Culture supernatant of the new isolate exhibited antimicrobial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, Micrococcus luteus, Escherichia coli, and Salmonella spp. The BLS was resistant to heat, acid and alkaline treatment. Activity of the BLS was totally lost after digestion by pronase and partially lost after digestion by papain and lipase. The new isolate and relevant BLS are potentially useful in food and feed applications.
TI  - Chemical characterization of bioactive compounds from the endophytic fungus Diaporthe helianthi isolated from Luehea divaricata.
AB  - Endophytic microorganisms, defined as fungi or bacteria that colonize the interior of plants without causing any immediate negative effects or damages, have reciprocal relationships with host plants. In some cases their presence is beneficial to the host due to the synthesis of bioactive compounds, among which several alcohols, esters, ketones and others that may react with other compounds and may be lethal to pathogenic microorganisms. Diaporthe helianthi (Phomopsis helianthi in its anamorphic phase) is available worldwide, especially in Europe, Asia and America. Isolated in Europe as an agent of the sunflower stem cancer, it has also been endophytically isolated from tropical and temperate plants. A D. helianthi strain isolated from Luehea divaricata has been employed in current research. An investigation of the secondary metabolite from D. helianthi by CC and NMR of (1)H and (13)C yielded the separation of 10 fractions and the identification of the phenolic compound 2(-4 hydroxyphenyl)-ethanol (Tyrosol). Its antimicrobial reaction was tested and the ensuing antagonistic effects on the human pathogenic bacteria Enterococcus hirae, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, Salmonella typhi, Staphylococcus aureus, phytopathogenic Xanthomonas asc. phaseoli and phytopathogenic fungi were demonstrated. Results show that bioactive compounds and Tyrosol produced by D. helianthi have a biotechnological potential.
TI  - A novel C1qDC protein acting as pattern recognition receptor in scallop Argopecten irradians.
AB  - The C1q domain containing (C1qDC) proteins refer to a family of proteins containing the versatile charge pattern recognition globular C1q domain in the C-terminus, which could bind various ligands including PAMPs and trigger a serial of immune response. In this study, a novel C1qDC protein was identified from Argopecten irradians (designated as AiC1qDC-2). Its full-length cDNA was of 1062 bp with an open reading frame of 720 bp encoding a polypeptide of 240 amino acids containing a typical gC1q domain. This gC1q domain possessed the typical 10-stranded beta-sandwich fold with a jelly-roll topology common to all C1q family members, and shared high homology with most of the other identified gC1q domains. The mRNA transcripts of AiC1qDC-2 were mainly detected in hepatopancreas, and also marginally detectable in mantle, gonad, adductor, gill and hemocytes. Its relative expression level in hemocytes was significantly up-regulated after challenges of fungi Pichia pastoris GS115 (P < 0.05), Gram-positive bacteria Micrococcus luteus (P < 0.05) and Gram-negative bacteria Vibrio anguillarum (P < 0.05). The recombinant protein of AiC1qDC-2 (rAiC1qDC-2) could bind various PAMPs, including LPS, PGN, polyI:C, mannan, beta-1,3-glucan as well as Yeast-glucan, and displayed agglutinating activity to fungi P. pastoris GS115, Gram-positive bacteria Bacillus subtilis and Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli TOP10F' as well as V. anguillarum. All these results indicated that AiC1qDC-2 could function as a pattern recognition receptor to recognize various PAMPs on different pathogens in the innate immune responses of scallop, and provided new clues to understand the role of invertebrate C1qDC proteins in the ancient complement system.
TI  - Potamotrygon cf. henlei stingray mucus: biochemical features of a novel antimicrobial protein.
AB  - Antimicrobial molecules are important components of the innate immune system in vertebrates. They have been studied widely in several fishes, but little is known about these defence factors in stingrays, which are thought to have less sophisticated adaptive immune systems when compared to other teleosts. Stingrays from the specie Potamotrygon cf. henlei are distributed throughout the rivers of central-west Brazil, being the cause of numerous envenomations occurring in the dry seasons. In a previous study, we reported that the mucus of the stingray P. cf. henlei shows antimicrobial effects. Here, to analyze the antimicrobial compounds from the mucus of P. cf. henlei, we employed solid-phase extraction, chromatographic separation followed by ESI-MS, and Edman degradation. A protein similar to the beta-chain of hemoglobin was identified, isolated and partially sequenced by Edman degradation. This protein has a molecular weight of 16072.8 Da, and was shown to be active against bacteria (Micrococcus luteus and Escherichiacoli) and yeast (Candida tropicalis) without hemolytic activity. Effects of this new protein in the microcirculation environment were also evaluated. The results obtained provide fundamental information for future basic research, clinical diagnosis and development of new therapies to accident treatment. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first description of a bioactive polypeptide from the mucus of a stingray.
TI  - Biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles using latex from few Euphorbian plants and their antimicrobial potential.
AB  - The synthesis of well-dispersed and ultrafine metal nanoparticles has great interest due to their distinctive physicochemical properties and biomedical applications. This study is the first report of one-step solvent-free synthesis of AgNPs using Euphorbiaceae plant latex. Among evaluated eight latex-producing plants, four (Jatropha curcas, Jatropha gossypifolia, Pedilanthus tithymaloides, and Euphorbia milii) showed high potential to produce physicochemically distinct, small-sized and bactericidal AgNPs. Phytochemical screening showed presence of rich amount of biochemicals in these plants. J. gossypifolia showed uniformly dispersed comparatively small-sized AgNPs. Dose-dependent growth inhibition of bacterial pathogens Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermis, and Micrococcus luteus was observed for J. gossypifolia latex-synthesized AgNPs with minimum inhibitory concentration values 30, 40, 70, 60, and 60 ppm, respectively, after 24 h. Possible mode of action of AgNPs against pathogens was confirmed by analyzing enzymes and cell leakage.
TI  - The transcriptome of Spodoptera exigua larvae exposed to different types of microbes.
AB  - We have obtained and characterized the transcriptome of Spodoptera exigua larvae  with special emphasis on pathogen-induced genes. In order to obtain a highly representative transcriptome, we have pooled RNA from diverse insect colonies, conditions and tissues. Sequenced cDNA included samples from 3 geographically different colonies. Enrichment of RNA from pathogen-related genes was accomplished by exposing larvae to different pathogenic and non-pathogenic microbial agents such as the bacteria Bacillus thuringiensis, Micrococcus luteus, and Escherichia coli, the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and the S. exigua nucleopolyhedrovirus (SeMNPV). In addition, to avoid the loss of tissue-specific genes we included cDNA from the midgut, fat body, hemocytes and integument derived from pathogen exposed insects. RNA obtained from the different types of samples was pooled, normalized and sequenced. Analysis of the sequences obtained using the Roche 454 FLX and Sanger methods has allowed the generation of the largest public set of ESTs from S. exigua, including a large group of immune genes, and the identification of an important number of SSR (simple sequence repeats) and SNVs (single nucleotide variants: SNPs and INDELs) with potential use as genetic markers. Moreover, data mining has allowed the discovery of novel RNA viruses with potential influence in the insect population dynamics and the larval interactions with the microbial pesticides that are currently in use for the biological control of this pest.
TI  - Antibacterial anthraquinone derivatives from a sea anemone-derived fungus Nigrospora sp.
AB  - Chemical investigation of a marine-derived fungus Nigrospora sp., isolated from an unidentified sea anemone, yielded two new hydroanthraquinone analogues, 4a-epi-9alpha-methoxydihydrodeoxybostrycin (1) and 10-deoxybostrycin (2), together with seven known anthraquinone derivatives (3-9). The structures of the two new compounds were established through extensive NMR spectroscopy as well as a single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis using Cu Kalpha radiation. The antibacterial activities of compounds 1-9 and 10 acetyl derivatives (6a, 7a, 8a-8g, 9a) were evaluated in vitro. Compound 6a, the acetylated derivative of 6, exhibited promising activity against Bacillus cereus with an MIC value of 48.8 nM, which was stronger than that of the positive control ciprofloxacin (MIC = 1250 nM). Analysis of the antibacterial screening data for the metabolites and their acetyl derivatives revealed the key structural features required for this activity.
TI  - The bactericidal effect of human secreted group IID phospholipase A2 results from both hydrolytic and non-hydrolytic activities.
AB  - The Human Secreted Group IID Phospholipase A(2) (hsPLA2GIID) may be involved in the human acute immune response. Here we have demonstrated that the hsPLA2GIID presents bactericidal and Ca(2+)-independent liposome membrane-damaging activities and we have compared these effects with the catalytic activity of active-site mutants of the protein. All mutants showed reduced hydrolytic activity against DOPC:DOPG liposome membranes, however bactericidal effects against Escherichia coli and Micrococcus luteus were less affected, with the D49K mutant retaining 30% killing of the Gram-negative bacteria at a concentration of 10mug/mL despite the absence of catalytic activity. The H48Q mutant maintained Ca(2+)-independent membrane-damaging activity whereas the G30S and D49K mutants were approximately 50% of the wild-type protein, demonstrating that phospholipid bilayer permeabilization by the hsPLA2GIID is independent of catalytic activity. We suggest that this Ca(2+)-independent damaging activity may play a role in the bactericidal function of the protein.
TI  - [Cloning and expression of Micrococcus luteus IAM 14879 Rpf and its role in the recovery of the VBNC state in Rhodococcus sp. DS471].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the present study was to produce the Rpf (resuscitation promoting factor) protein by cloning and expressing the rpf gene, secreted by Micrococcus luteus IAM 14879, in Escherichia coli and to evaluate its role in the recovery of the VBNC (viable but non-culturable) state in high-GC Gram-positive bacteria. METHODS: Genomic DNA was extracted from Micrococcus luteus IAM 14879 and the rpf gene was amplified by PCR using specific primers. The PCR products was purified, cloned into a pET15b expression vector, and transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). Then the pET15b plasmid expression vector was used to confirm the purification of the recombinant proteins via SDS-PAGE. The VBNC state cells from the high-GC Gram-positive bacteria, Rhodococcus sp. DS471, were used to confirm the promotion and recovery of growth capacity. Rhodococcus sp. DS471 were isolated from soil and closely related to Micrococcus luteus IAM 14879. RESULTS: The gene sequences confirmed that the rpf gene from Micrococcus luteus IAM 14879 that was expressed in Escherichia coli, was 672 bp. SDS-PAGE analysis showed that the recombinant Rpf protein was obtained successfully, and further studies showed it capable of promoting the recovery of the VBNC state by about 100-fold relative to the control. CONCLUSION: Rpf of Micrococus luteus IAM 14879 can be successfully cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli and shows a strong ability to promote the recovery of the VBNC state of cells of Rhodococcus sp. DS471.
TI  - A novel PCR-based method for high throughput prokaryotic expression of antimicrobial peptide genes.
AB  - BACKGROUND: To facilitate the screening of large quantities of new antimicrobial  peptides (AMPs), we describe a cost-effective method for high throughput prokaryotic expression of AMPs. EDDIE, an autoproteolytic mutant of the N-terminal autoprotease, Npro, from classical swine fever virus, was selected as a fusion protein partner. The expression system was used for high-level expression of six antimicrobial peptides with different sizes: Bombinin-like peptide 7, Temporin G, hexapeptide, Combi-1, human Histatin 9, and human Histatin 6. These expressed AMPs were purified and evaluated for antimicrobial activity. RESULTS: Two or four primers were used to synthesize each AMP gene in a single step PCR. Each synthetic gene was then cloned into the pET30a/His-EDDIE-GFP vector via an in vivo recombination strategy. Each AMP was then expressed as an Npro fusion protein in Escherichia coli. The expressed fusion proteins existed as inclusion bodies in the cytoplasm and the expression levels of the six AMPs reached up to 40% of the total cell protein content. On in vitro refolding, the fusion AMPs was released from the C-terminal end of the autoprotease by self-cleavage, leaving AMPs with an authentic N terminus. The released fusion partner was easily purified by Ni-NTA chromatography. All recombinant AMPs displayed expected antimicrobial activity against E. coli, Micrococcus luteus and S. cerevisia. CONCLUSIONS: The method described in this report allows the fast synthesis of genes that are optimized for over-expression in E. coli and for the production of sufficiently large amounts of peptides for functional and structural characterization. The Npro partner system, without the need for chemical or enzymatic removal of the fusion tag, is a low-cost, efficient way of producing AMPs for characterization. The cloning method, combined with bioinformatic analyses from genome and EST sequence data, will also be useful for screening new AMPs. Plasmid pET30a/His-EDDIE-GFP also provides green/white colony selection for high-throughput recombinant AMP cloning.
TI  - Interaction of type A lantibiotics with undecaprenol-bound cell envelope precursors.
AB  - Lantibiotics are a unique group within the antimicrobial peptides characterized by the presence of thioether amino acids (lanthionine and methyllanthionine). These peptides are produced by and primarily act on Gram-positive bacteria exerting multiple activities at the cytoplasmic membrane of susceptible strains. Previously, the cell wall precursor lipid II was identified as the molecular target for the prototype lantibiotic nisin. Binding and sequestration of lipid II blocks the incorporation of the central cell wall precursor into the growing peptidoglycan network, thereby inhibiting the formation of a functional cell wall. Additionally, nisin combines this activity with a unique target-mediated pore formation, using lipid II as a docking molecule. The interaction with the pyrophosphate moiety of lipid II is crucial for nisin binding. We show that, besides binding to lipid II, nisin interacts with the lipid intermediates lipid III (undecaprenol-pyrophosphate-N-acetyl-glucosamine) and lipid IV (undecaprenol-pyrophosphate-N-acetyl-glucosamine-N-acetyl-mannosamine) of the wall teichoic acid (WTA) biosynthesis pathway. Binding of nisin to the precursors was observed at a stoichiometry of 2:1. The specific interaction with WTA precursors further promoted target-mediated pore formation in artificial lipid bilayers. Specific interactions with lipid III and lipid IV could also be demonstrated for related type A lantibiotics, for example, gallidermin, containing the conserved lipid-II-binding motif.
TI  - Glass-(nAg, nCu) biocide coatings on ceramic oxide substrates.
AB  - The present work was focused on obtaining biocide coatings constituted by a glassy soda-lime matrix containing silver or copper nanoparticles on ceramic (alumina and zirconia based) substrates. Both glassy coatings showed a high biocide activity against Gram-, Gram+ bacteria and yeast, reducing cell numbers more than three logarithms. Silver nanoparticles had a significantly higher biocide activity than copper nanoparticles, since the lixiviation levels required to reduce cell numbers more than 3 logarithms was of almost 1-2 microg/cm(2) in the case of silver nanoparticles, and 10-15 microg/cm(2) for the copper nanoparticles.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Chinese bayberry extract for the preservation of surimi.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chemical preservatives such as sodium nitrite and potassium sorbate have been widely used to keep surimi products fresh. However, the potential harmfulness to human health cannot be ignored. This study was conducted to develop natural preservatives for the storage of Collichthys surimi. RESULTS: Among the eight Chinese traditional herbs and fruits, Chinese bayberry extract showed the greatest inhibitory effect against surimi spoilage bacteria Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Moreover, N-butanol phase extract of bayberry (NB) showed the greatest activity among the different phases of bayberry extract. When Chinese bayberry extract was combined with tea polyphenol, an additive inhibitory effect was observed on growth of Hansenula anomala, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli. Our results further indicated that the shelf life of surimi products stored at room temperature can be extended when supplemented with Chinese bayberry extract. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that Chinese bayberry extract can be used as a natural preservative for the storage of Collichthys surimi.
TI  - Production of human lactoferrin in animal milk.
AB  - Genetic constructs containing the human lactoferrin (hLf) gene were created within a joint program of Russian and Belorussian scientists. Using these constructs, transgenic mice were bred (the maximum hLf concentration in their milk was 160 g/L), and transgenic goats were also generated (up to 10 g/L hLf in their milk). Experimental goatherds that produced hLf in their milk were also bred, and the recombinant hLf was found to be identical to the natural protein in its physical and chemical properties. These properties included electrophoretic mobility, isoelectric point, recognition by polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies, circular dichroic spectra, interaction with natural ligands (DNA, lipopolysaccharides, and heparin), the binding of iron ions, the sequence of the 7 terminal amino acids, and its biological activity. The latter was assessed by the agglutination of Micrococcus luteus protoplasts, bactericidal activity against Escherichia coli and Listeria monocytogenes , and fungicidal activity against Candida albicans . We also demonstrated a significant increase in the activity of antibiotics when used in combination with Lf.
TI  - A scallop C-type lectin from Argopecten irradians (AiCTL5) with activities of lipopolysaccharide binding and Gram-negative bacteria agglutination.
AB  - C-type lectins are a family of calcium-dependent carbohydrate-binding proteins. In the present study, a C-type lectin (designated as AiCTL5) was identified and characterized from Argopecten irradians. The full-length cDNA of AiCTL5 was of 673 bp, containing a 5' untranslated region (UTR) of 24 bp, a 3' UTR of 130 bp with a poly (A) tail, and an open reading frame (ORF) of 519 bp encoding a polypeptide of 172 amino acids with a putative signal peptide of 17 amino acids. A C-type lectin-like domain (CRD) containing 6 conserved cysteines and a putative glycosylation sites were identified in the deduced amino acid sequence of AiCTL5. AiCTL5 shared 11%-27.5% identity with the previous reported C-type lectin from A. irradians. The cDNA fragment encoding the mature peptide of AiCTL5 was recombined into pET-21a (+) with a C-terminal hexa-histidine tag fused in-frame, and expressed in Escherichia coli Origami (DE3). The recombinant AiCTL5 (rAiCTL5) agglutinated Gram-negative E. coli TOP10F' and Listonella anguillarum, but did not agglutinate Gram-positive bacteria Bacillus thuringiensis and Micrococcus luteus, and the agglutination could be inhibited by EDTA, indicating that AiCTL5 was a Ca(2+)-dependent lectin. rAiCTL5 exhibited a significantly strong activity to bind LPS from E. coli, which conformed to the agglutinating activity toward Gram-negative bacteria. Moreover, rAiCTL5 also agglutinated rabbit erythrocytes. These results indicated that AiCTL5 could function as a pattern recognition receptor to protect bay scallop from Gram-negative bacterial infection, and also provide evidence to understand the structural and functional diverse of lectin.
TI  - Molecular characterization of the sigma class gutathione S-transferase from Chilo suppressalis and expression analysis upon bacterial and insecticidal challenge.
AB  - The insect glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) play an important role in the detoxification of xenobiotic compounds and are related to insecticides resistance. The full-length cDNA sequences encoding the sigma class GST protein (CsGSTsigma) was cloned from the Asiatic rice borer, Chilo suppressalis (Walker), one of the most important rice pests in Asia. The comparison of amino acid sequences showed that CsGSTsigma is highly similar to the sigma GST isolated from the domestic silkworm, Bombyx mori (L.). A homology model of CsGSTsigma was constructed and its binding environment for GSH is identical to that in the equivalent site of sigma GST from the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster Meigen. The developmental changes of the relative mRNA expression levels of CsGSTsigma were examined in Asiatic rice borer, and the highest expression level of this gene is in adult followed by the third-instar larvae stage. Furthermore, one gram-positive bacterium and two chemical insecticides were found to be able to induce the increasing expression of CsGSTsigma, suggesting that CsGSTsigma might work as an antioxidant enzyme to against the negative effects caused by both pathogens and xenobiotics.
TI  - In vivo antioxidative property, antimicrobial and wound healing activity of flower extracts of Pyrostegia venusta (Ker Gawl) Miers.
AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Pyrostegia venusta (Ker Gawl) Miers. (Bignoniaceae), has been traditionally used as a remedy for treating white patches and infections on the skin (leukoderma, vitiligo). AIM OF THE STUDY: To investigate wound healing and antimicrobial activity of flower extract of Pyrostegia venusta, including in vivo antioxidant activity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Methanolic extracts of Pyrostegia venusta flowers were studied for wound healing efficiency along with its effect on pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines was assessed using excision and incision model of wound repair in Wistar rats. Healing was assessed by the rate of wound contraction, tensile strength, breaking strength, hydroxyproline and hexosamine content. Antimicrobial activity of the flower extract against twelve microorganisms was also assessed. In vivo antioxidant activity was performed to understand the mechanism of wound healing potency. RESULTS: The results indicated that Pyrostegia venusta extract has potent wound healing capacity as evident from the wound contraction and increased tensile strength. Hydroxyproline and hexosamine expression were also correlative with the healing pattern observed. Pyrostegia venusta extract exhibited moderate antimicrobial activity against the organisms: Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, Enterobacter aerogenes, Salmonella typhi, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, Aspergillus niger and Candida tropicana. During early wound healing phase TNF-alpha and IL-6 level were found to be up regulated by Pyrostegia venusta treatment. CONCLUSION: Increased wound contraction and tensile strength, augmented hydroxyproline and hexosamine content along with antioxidative activity and moderate antimicrobial activity support the early wound healing exhibited by Pyrostegia venusta flower extract. Induction in cytokine production may be one of the mechanisms involved in accelerating the wound healing by Pyrostegia venusta extract. Results suggest that Pyrostegia venusta may be useful in the tropical management of wound healing.
TI  - Antioxidant and antibacterial properties of green, black, and herbal teas of Camellia sinensis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The role of non-polymeric phenolic (NP) and polymeric tannin (PT) constituents in the antioxidant and antibacterial properties of six brands of green, black, and herbal teas of Camellia sinensis were investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Total phenolic content (TPC) and ascorbic acid equivalent antioxidant capacity (AEAC) were assessed using the Folin-Ciocalteu and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assays, respectively. Minimum inhibitory dose (MID) against Gram-positive Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacillus cereus, and Gram-negative. Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was assessed using the disc-diffusion method. Teas were extracted with hot water successively three times for one hour each time. The extracts were fractionated using Sephadex LH-20 column chromatography to obtain the NP and PT constituents. RESULTS: Extraction yields ranged from 12 to 23%. Yields of NP fractions (70-81%) were much higher than those of PT fractions (1-11%), suggesting that the former are the major tea components. Ranking of antioxidant properties of extracts was green tea>black tea>herbal tea. For all six teas, antioxidant properties of PT fractions were significantly higher than extracts and NP fractions. Extracts and fractions of all six teas showed no activity against the three Gram-negative bacteria. Green teas inhibited all three Gram-positive bacteria with S. aureus being the least susceptible. Black and herbal teas inhibited the growth of M. luteus and B. cereus, but not S. aureus. The most potent were the PT fractions of Boh Cameron Highlands and Ho Yan Hor with MID of 0.01 and 0.03 mg/disc against M. luteus. CONCLUSION: Results suggested that NP constituents are major contributors to the antioxidant and antibacterial properties of teas of C. sinensis. Although PT constituents have stronger antioxidant and antibacterial properties, they constitute only a minor component of the teas.
TI  - Antimicrobial peptide gene induction, involvement of Toll and IMD pathways and defense against bacteria in the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum.
AB  - Using Tribolium castaneum, we quantitatively investigated the induction of nine antimicrobial peptide (AMP) genes by live gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae), gram-positive bacteria (Micrococcus luteus and Bacillus subtilis) and the budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). Then, five representative AMP genes were selected, and the involvement of the Toll and IMD pathways in their induction by E. coli, M. luteus and S. cerevisiae was examined by utilizing RNA interference of either MyD88 or IMD. Results indicated: Robust and acute induction of three genes by the two bacterial species was mediated mainly by the IMD pathway; slow and sustained induction of one gene by the two bacteria was mediated mainly by the Toll pathway; induction of the remaining one gene by the two bacteria was mediated by both pathways; induction of the five genes by the yeast was mediated by the Toll and/or IMD pathways depending on respective genes. These results suggest that more promiscuous activation and usage of the two pathways may occur in T. castaneum than in Drosophila melanogaster. In addition, the IMD pathway was revealed to dominantly contribute to defense against two bacterial species, gram-negative E. cloacae and gram-positive B. subtilis that possesses DAP-type peptidoglycan.
TI  - Functional analysis of two lebocin-related proteins from Manduca sexta.
AB  - Insects produce a group of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) in response to microbial infections. Most AMPs are synthesized as inactive precursors/pro-proteins and require proteolytic processing to generate small active peptides. Here we report identification and functional analysis of two lebocin-related proteins (Leb-B and Leb-C) from the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta. The mRNA levels of Leb-B and Leb-C increased significantly in larval fat body and hemocytes after injection of Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Western blotting using rabbit polyclonal antibody to Leb-B showed accumulation of large protein(s) and small peptide(s) in larval hemolymph after microbial injection. This result and the presence of RXXR motifs in the deduced amino acid sequences led to our postulation that Leb-B/C may be inactive precursors that are processed in larval hemolymph to generate short active peptides. To test this hypothesis, we expressed and purified full-length and various fragments of Leb-B and Leb-C as thioredoxin (TRX) fusion proteins. We found that fusion proteins could be cleaved by induced larval plasma, and the cleavage sites were determined by protein sequencing. Antibacterial activity of peptide fragments was also verified using synthetic peptides, and active M. sexta lebocin peptides were located at the N-termini of Leb-B/C, which are different from Bombyx mori lebocins 1-4 that are located close to the C-termini. In addition, we found that synthetic Leb-B(22-48) peptide not only had higher antibacterial activity but also caused agglutination of E. coli cells. Our results provide valuable information for studying processing of lebocin precursors in lepidopteran insects.
TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial activities of novel 2,5-diphenylindolo[2,3-e] pyrazolo[1',5':3",4"]pyrimido[2",1"-c] [1,2,4]triazines.
AB  - The formation of (E)-3-{2-(2,5-diphenylpyrazolo[1,5-c]pyrimidin-7-yl)hydrazono}indolin-2-ones 3 has been achieved by condensation of equimolar amounts of 7-hydrazino-2,5-diphenylpyrazolo[1,5-c]pyrimidine (1) and isatin (or isatin derivatives) 2 at room temperature. The (E)-products could be isomerized into corresponding the (Z)-3 isomers. Reactions of the latter fused heterocyclic hydrazones towards different electro-philic reagents yielded the corresponding 3-substituted derivatives 4-7. Dehydrative cyclisation of the hydrazones 3 using phosphorus oxychloride afforded the 2,5-diphenyl- indolo[2,3-e]pyrazolo[1',5':3",4"]pyrimido[2",1"-c][1,2,4] triazines 13. The polyfused heterocyclic ring system 13 underwent electrophilic substitution reactions at position 4 rather than at position 3. The 3-bromo isomer of 17 was prepared by a sequence of reactions starting from 2,5-diphenylpyrazolo[1,5-c]pyrimidine-7(6H)-thione (11). The orientation of the electrophilic attack was supported by spectroscopic and chemical evidence. Some of the synthesized compounds were found to possess slight to moderate activity against the microorganisms Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Palmaenones A and B, two new antimicrobial chlorinated cyclopentenones from discomycete Lachnum palmae.
AB  - Two new antimicrobial chlorinated cyclopentenones, palmaenones A (1) and B (2) were isolated from the culture broth of discomycete Lachnum palmae (NBRC-106495), and the structures of 1 and 2 were elucidated by spectroscopic data and the stereochemistry of 1 was directly determined by a single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. Palmaenones A (1) and B (2) are cyclopentenones containing three chlorines. Compound 1 exhibited potent antimicrobial activity against Micrococcus luteus, Mycobacterium smegmatis, Escherichia coli, Xanthomonas campestris, and Mucor racemosus, while the activities of compound 2 were weaker than 1.
TI  - Antimicrobial peptides keep insect endosymbionts under control.
AB  - Vertically transmitted endosymbionts persist for millions of years in invertebrates and play an important role in animal evolution. However, the functional basis underlying the maintenance of these long-term resident bacteria is unknown. We report that the weevil coleoptericin-A (ColA) antimicrobial peptide selectively targets endosymbionts within the bacteriocytes and regulates their growth through the inhibition of cell division. Silencing the colA gene with RNA interference resulted in a decrease in size of the giant filamentous endosymbionts, which escaped from the bacteriocytes and spread into insect tissues. Although this family of peptides is commonly linked with microbe clearance, this work shows that endosymbiosis benefits from ColA, suggesting that long-term host-symbiont coevolution might have shaped immune effectors for symbiont maintenance.
TI  - Activity and immunodetection of lysozyme in earthworm Dendrobaena veneta (Annelida).
AB  - In the present study, lysozyme-like activity against Micrococcus luteus was detected in the coelomic fluid, the extract from coelomocytes, intestine and in the homogenates from cocoons of Dendrobaena veneta. Four hours after immunization with Escherichia coli, the lysozyme activity in the coelomic fluid increased about three times and in the extract of coelomocytes - four times, in comparison to the control. In three cases: of the coelomic fluid, the homogenates from cocoons and the extract from coelomocytes, the antibody against HEWL (hen egg white lysozyme) recognized only one protein with a molecular mass of about 14.4 kDa. In the coelomic fluid, apart from the protein with molecular mass of 14.4 kDa the antibody directed against human lysozyme recognized an additional protein of 22 kDa. Using the bioautography technique after electrophoretic resolution of native proteins in acidic polyacrylamide gels, two lytic zones of M. luteus were observed in the case of the coelomic fluid and three after the analysis of the extract of coelomocytes and the egg homogenates. The results indicated the existence of several forms of lysozyme with a different electric charge in the analyzed D. veneta samples. The highest lysozyme activity in the intestine of D. veneta was observed in the midgut. The antibody directed against human lysozyme indicated a strong positive signal in epidermal and midgut cells of earthworm.
TI  - Interplay between thermal and immune ecology: effect of environmental temperature on insect immune response and energetic costs after an immune challenge.
AB  - Although the study of thermoregulation in insects has shown that infected animals tend to prefer higher temperatures than healthy individuals, the immune response and energetic consequences of this preference remain unknown. We examined the effect of environmental temperature and the energetic costs associated to the activation of the immune response of Tenebrio molitor larvae following a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge. We measured the effect of temperature on immune parameters including phenoloxidase (PO) activity and antibacterial responses. Further as proximal and distal costs of the immune response we determined the standard metabolic rate (SMR) and the loss of body mass (m(b)), respectively. Immune response was stronger at 30 degrees C than was at 10 or 20 degrees C. While SMR at 10 and 20 degrees C did not differ between immune treatments, at 30 degrees C SMR of LPS-treated larvae was almost 25-60% higher than SMR of PBS-treated and naive larvae. In addition, the loss in m(b) was 1.9 and 4.2 times higher in LPS-treated larvae than in PBS-treated and naive controls. The immune responses exhibited a positive correlation with temperature and both, SMR and m(b) change, were sensitive to environmental temperature. These data suggest a significant effect of environmental temperature on the immune response and on the energetic costs of immunity.
TI  - A new sesquiterpene from endophytic fungus Aspergillus sp.
AB  - A fungal strain named YLF-14 was isolated from the leaf of Altingia yunnunensis.  Based on the sequence at the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region, the strain was identified as an Aspergillus sp.. A new sesquiterpene 5beta,8abeta-dimethyl-3,4,4abeta,5,6,7,8,8a-octahydronaphthalene-1,2,5alpha-trime thanol (1) and a known compound 12-N-methylcyclo-(L-tryptophyl-L-phenylalanyl) (2) were isolated from the culture of this strain. Bioassay experiments showed that the two compounds had no obvious effect on the growth of tested bacteria and nematodes.
TI  - Synthesis, antimicrobial activity and cytotoxicity of some new carbazole derivatives.
AB  - In this work, some N-(9-Ethyl-9H-carbazole-3-yl)-2-(phenoxy)acetamide derivatives were synthesised and evaluated for their antimicrobial activity and cytotoxicity. The structural elucidation of the compounds was performed by IR, (1)H-NMR, (13)C-NMR and FAB(+)-MS spectral data and elemental analyses. The title compounds were obtained by reacting 2-chloro-N-(9-ethyl-9H-carbazole-3-yl)acetamide with some substituted phenols. The synthesised compounds were investigated for their antibacterial and antifungal activities against Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes and Candida albicans. The compounds N-(9-Ethyl-9H-carbazole-3-yl)-2-(4-ethylphenoxy)acetamide (2c) and N-(9-Ethyl-9H-carbazole-3-yl)-2-(quinolin-8-yloxy)acetamide (2n) showed notable antimicrobial activity. The compounds were also studied for their cytotoxic effects using MTT assay, and it was seen that 2n had the lowest cytotoxic activity against NIH/3T3 cells.
TI  - In vitro screening of Circium arvense for potential antibacterial and antifungal  activities.
AB  - The antimicrobial activities of Circium arvense extracts were evaluated against two human gram positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Micrococcus luteus) and four gram negative pathogen (Escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter, Klebsiella pneumoniae). The Methanol extracts of Circium arvense were used to obtain various fractions (X1) n-hexane, (X2) chloroform, (X3) ethyl acetate and (X4) n-butanol. The agar well diffusion assay and agar dilution susceptibility testing were carried out to determine the zone of inhibitions and the minimum inhibitory concentration respectively. Antifungal activity was employed by agar well diffusion method. The Ampicilline, Ofloxacine and Itraconazole were used as standard agents. Almost all fractions exhibited more or less antimicrobial activity. The X2 (Chloroform) fraction was reported as highly active fraction with good antimicrobial activity MIC 0.312 mg/ml against staphylococcus areous. The MBC values of fraction X2 (chloroform) was 2 times the MIC. Similarly all fractions exhibited good inhibitory activities against Aspergillus niger. The fraction X1(n-hexane) was found highly active 6(+/-0.11), followed by X2 (chloroform) fraction 5 (+/-0.17). Present study provides a base to explore the antimicrobial potential of Circium arvense. It is concluded that the Circium arvense having potential antibacterial and antifungal activities, irrespective of fact that the MIC values reported were high. Further investigations are recommended to exploit the hidden medicinal value of plant.
TI  - Molecular cloning and characterization of the STAT gene in Hyphantria cunea haemocytes.
AB  - A new insect member of the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) family of transcription factors, Hyphantria cunea STAT (HcSTAT), was cloned from the lepidopteran H. cunea. The domain involved in DNA interaction and the Src homology 2 (SH2) domain were well conserved. During all developmental stages, the gene was expressed at a low level in the haemocytes, fat body cells, midgut, epidermis and Malpighian tubules. The haemocytes and Malpighian tubules showed transcriptional activation of HcSTAT upon Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacterial challenges. These challenges increased the induction and nuclear translocation of the HcSTAT protein that recognizes a STAT target site in H. cunea haemocytes. In vivo treatment with sodium orthovanadate translocated HcSTAT to the haemocyte nucleus. This study shows the involvement of the haemocyte Janus kinase/STAT pathway after microbial infection in lepidopteran insects.
TI  - Phytochemical screening and antimicrobial activity of roots of Murraya koenigii (Linn.) Spreng. (Rutaceae).
AB  - Murraya koenigii, family Rutaceae, commonly known as Curry leaf plant is a highly valued plant for its medicinal value and characteristic aroma. The plant is a rich source of carbazole alkaloids. The petroleum ether, chloroform, ethyl acetate and ethanol extracts of roots of the plant were screened for phytochemical properties and antimicrobial activity for Staphylococcus aureus, Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans and Aspergillus niger. Phytochemical screening showed the presence of carbohydrates, alkaloids, steroids and flavonoids in the root extracts of the plant. The study shows that all the extracts possess remarkable antibacterial activity. Additionally, petroleum ether and chloroform extracts also had antifungal activity.
TI  - The generation of antimicrobial peptide activity: a trade-off between charge and  aggregation?
AB  
TI  - A new biphenyl and antimicrobial activity of extracts and compounds from Clusia burlemarxii.
AB  - Phytochemical investigation on Clusia burlemarxii (Clusiaceae) led to isolation and identification of nine compounds. Were isolated from leaves 3-O-alpha-L- rhamnopyranosylquercetin, 3-O-alpha-L-rhamnopyranosylkaempferol, 4-hydroxy-5,5-dimethyldihydrofuran-2-one, 2Z-delta-tocotrienoloic acid and friedelin and were isolated from trunk betulinic acid, protocatechuic acid, lyoniresinol, and a new biphenyl 2,2-dimethyl-3,5-dihydroxy-7-(4-hydroxyphenyl)chromane. The structures were determined by (1)H, (1)(3)C-NMR, DEPT, HMBC, HMQC, HRESIMS. The Minimal Inhibitory Concentration against Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella choleraesuis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Aspergillus niger and Cladosporium cladosporioides was also determined. Extracts and compounds showed significant activity against tested Gram-positive bacteria, none activity against tested Gram-negative bacteria and fungi.
TI  - Antibacterial properties of the skin mucus of the freshwater fishes, Rita rita and Channa punctatus.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The skin mucus of Rita rita and Channa punctatus was investigated to  explore the possibilities of its antibacterial properties. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Skin mucus was extracted in acidic solvents (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and 3% acetic acid) and in triple distilled water (aqueous medium). The antibacterial activity of the mucus extracts was analyzed, using disc diffusion method, against five strains of bacteria--the Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus and Micrococcus luteus; and the Gram negative Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella typhi. RESULTS: In both Rita rita and Channa punctatus, the skin mucus extracted in acidic solvents as well as in aqueous medium show antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Micrococcus luteus. Nevertheless, the activity is higher in acidic solvents than that in aqueous medium. The acidic mucus extracts of Rita rita, show antibacterial activity against Salmonella typhi as well. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that fish skin mucus have bactericidal properties and thus play important role in the protection of fish against the invasion of pathogens. Fish skin mucus could thus be regarded as a potential source of novel antibacterial components.
TI  - Antibiotic production by myxobacteria plays a role in predation.
AB  - Myxobacteria are predatory and are prolific producers of secondary metabolites. Here, we tested a hypothesized role that secondary metabolite antibiotics function as weapons in predation. To test this, a Myxococcus xanthus Deltata1 mutant, blocked in antibiotic TA (myxovirescin) production, was constructed. This TA(-) mutant was defective in producing a zone of inhibition (ZOI) against Escherichia coli. This shows that TA is the major M. xanthus-diffusible antibacterial agent against E. coli. Correspondingly, the TA(-) mutant was defective in E. coli killing. Separately, an engineered E. coli strain resistant to TA was shown to be resistant toward predation. Exogenous addition of spectinomycin, a bacteriostatic antibiotic, rescued the predation defect of the TA(-) mutant. In contrast, against Micrococcus luteus the TA(-) mutant exhibited no defect in ZOI or killing. Thus, TA plays a selective role on prey species. To extend these studies to other myxobacteria, the role of antibiotic corallopyronin production in predation was tested and also found to be required for Corallococcus coralloides killing on E. coli. Next, a role of TA production in myxobacterial fitness was assessed by measuring swarm expansion. Here, the TA(-) mutant had a specific swarm rate reduction on prey lawns, and thus reduced fitness, compared to an isogenic TA(+) strain. Based on these observations, we conclude that myxobacterial antibiotic production can function as a predatory weapon. To our knowledge, this is the first report to directly show a link between secondary metabolite production and predation.
TI  - Antioxidant, electrochemical, thermal, antimicrobial and alkane oxidation properties of tridentate Schiff base ligands and their metal complexes.
AB  - In this study, two Schiff base ligands (HL(1) and HL(2)) and their Cu(II), Co(II), Ni(II), Pd(II) and Ru(III) metal complexes were synthesized and characterized by the analytical and spectroscopic methods. Alkane oxidation activities of the metal complexes were studied on cyclohexane as substrate. The ligands and their metal complexes were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity against Corynebacterium xerosis, Bacillus brevis, Bacillus megaterium, Bacillus cereus, Mycobacterium smegmatis, Staphylococcus aureus, Micrococcus luteus and Enterococcus faecalis (as gram-positive bacteria) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Yersinia enterocolitica, Klebsiella fragilis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Candida albicans (as gram-negative bacteria). The antioxidant properties of the Schiff base ligands were evaluated in a series of in vitro tests: 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical scavenging and reducing power activity of superoxide anion radical generated non-enzymatic systems. Electrochemical and thermal properties of the compounds were investigated.
TI  - Bacterial infection of mudfish Clarias gariepinus (Siluriformes: Clariidae) fingerlings in tropical nursery ponds.
AB  - Bacterial infection among the most common cultured mudfish Clarias gariepinus in  Africa, has become a cause of concern, because it constitutes the largest economic loss in fish farms. In order to provide useful biological data of the pathogens for good management practices, samples were collected monthly between January 2008 and December 2009 in three monoculture nursery ponds, located in three different positions: upriver (A, grassland), mid-river (B, mixed forest and grassland) and downriver (C, rainforest) along 200 km length of Cross River floodplains, Nigeria. A total of 720 fingerlings between 15.1 and 20.7 g were analyzed to determine the degree of infection. The bacterial pathogens were taken from their external surfaces, and were isolated and identified by standard methods. The caudal fins of fingerlings from pond A had the highest bacterial load (5.8 x 10(3) cfu/g), while the least counts (1.2 x 103 cfu/g) were identified on the head of fish from pond C, with Flexibacter columnaris as the major etiological agent. Pseudomonas fluorescens, Aeromonas hydrophila, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Micrococcus luteus were identified as co-isolates with P. fluorescens as dominant (0.7 x 10(2) cfu/mL) co-isolates in pond water. Clinical signs of five white spots with red periphery appeared on the external surface of infected fish. All the fish sampled, died after 4 to 9 days. There was no significant difference in the bacterial counts between different ponds, but the difference between fish organs/parts examined was significant. Fish from these ponds are therefore potentially dangerous to consumers and highly devalued, with the economic impact to producers. Preventive methods to avoid these infections are recommended.
TI  - RYH: a minimal peptidic sequence obtained from beta-chain hemoglobin exhibiting an antimicrobial activity.
AB  - Bovine hemoglobin is an animal protein described as source of bioactive peptides. Enzymatic hydrolysis of this protein results into some peptides exhibiting antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. In this study, a family of peptides from the beta chain (beta-114-145 derived peptides) obtained by peptic hydrolysis of bovine hemoglobin, was purified by reverse-phase HPLC and characterized by different analytical techniques (mass spectrometry, circular dichroism). The minimum inhibitory concentration was determined to show the antimicrobial activity of these peptides. Four bacterial strains were used: two Gram-negative (Escherichia coli and Salmonella Enteritidis) and two Gram-positive strains (Listeria innocua and Micrococcus luteus). The effect of these peptides on artificial membrane was also measured. Our findings showed that the peptide beta114-145 and its peptic derivatives contain the RYH sequence. The most antimicrobial peptide is the RYH peptide which was the shortest one.
TI  - Phytochemical analysis and antimicrobial activities of methanolic extracts of leaf, stem and root from different varieties of Labisa pumila Benth.
AB  - A local herb, Kacip Fatimah, is famous amongst Malay women for its uses in parturition; however, its phytochemical contents have not been fully documented. Therefore, a study was performed to evaluate the phenolics, flavonoids, and total saponin contents, and antibacterial and antifungal properties of the leaf, stem and root of three varieties of Labisia pumila Benth. Total saponins were found to be higher in the leaves of all three varieties, compared to the roots and stems. Leaves of var. pumila exhibited significantly higher total saponin content than var. alata and lanceolata, with values of 56.4, 43.6 and 42.3 mg diosgenin equivalent/g dry weight, respectively. HPLC analyses of phenolics and flavonoids in all three varieties revealed the presence of gallic acid, caffeic acid, rutin, and myricetin in all plant parts. Higher levels of flavonoids (rutin, quercitin, kaempferol) were observed in var. pumila compared with alata and lanceolata, whereas higher accumulation of phenolics (gallic acid, pyrogallol) was recorded in var. alata, followed by pumila and lanceolata. Antibacterial activities of leaf, stem and root extracts of all varieties determined against both Gram positive (Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus subtilis B145, Bacillus cereus B43, Staphylococcus aureus S1431) and Gram negative (Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumonia K36, Escherichia coli E256, Pseudomonas aeruginosa PI96) pathogens showed that crude methanolic extracts are active against these bacteria at low concentrations, albeit with lower antibacterial activity compared to kanamycin used as the control. Antifungal activity of methanolic extracts of all plant parts against Fusarium sp., Candida sp. and Mucor using the agar diffusion disc exhibited moderate to appreciable antifungal activities compared to streptomycin used as positive control.
TI  - Natural resistance of rose petals to microbial attack.
AB  - Petals of red, yellow and white roses (Rosa damascene Mill.) of the family Rosaceae were extracted with (1:1) methylene chloride/methanol and tested for their antimicrobial activities against four species of Gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus and Staphylococcus aureus), five species of Gram-negative bacteria (Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia marcescens) and five species of fungi (Penicillium notatum, Aspergillus niger, Rhizopus stolonifer, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Fusarium oxysporum). All of the crude extracts showed a wide range of antimicrobial activities according to the tested organism and rose's type. Micrococcus luteus was found to be the most susceptible bacteria to all crude extracts. Red and yellow petal extracts showed much higher antibacterial activity than the white petals extract. Bacillus subtilis was found to be the least susceptible to all extracts. The fungus, Penicillium notatum was found to be the most susceptible with white petal extract being the most effective. Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Fusarium oxysporum were the least susceptible to all extracts. White roses extract showed much higher antifungal activities against Penicillium notatum than red or yellow roses, therefore, it was subjected to several bioassay guided chromatographic fractionations and purification to isolate the active chemical(s) responsible for the antifungal activity. Chemical structure of the isolated antifungal compounds were identified by spectroscopy techniques and found to be a gamma-sitosterol and (Z,Z)-9,12-octadecadienoic acid. Antibacterial activity of the various types of rose extracts were due to complex mixtures of organic compounds which are still under chemical investigation and will be published later.
TI  - A novel type III crustin (CrusEs2) identified from Chinese mitten crab Eriocheir  sinensis.
AB  - Antimicrobial peptides are important effectors in the host innate immune response against microbial invasion. In the present study, the cDNA encoding a crustin (designated CrusEs2) was cloned from Chinese mitten crab Eriocheir sinensis by using EST analysis and rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) approach. The full-length cDNA of CrusEs2 was of 1237 bp, containing a 5' untranslated region (UTR) of 12 bp, a 3' UTR of 886 bp with a poly (A) tail, and an open reading frame (ORF) of 339 bp encoding a polypeptide of 112 amino acids with a signal peptide of 19 amino acids. The CrusEs2 contained a typical WAP domain, but lacked the Gly-rich domain of the type II crustin and the Cys-rich region present in both type I and type II crustin, suggesting that CrusEs2 should be classified as a type III crustin. The mRNA transcripts of CrusEs2 could be detected in haemocytes and gill, and its expression level in haemocytes was up-regulated after Listonella anguillarum challenge, while decreased after Micrococcus luteus challenge. The mature peptide coding region of CrusEs2 was cloned into pET-21a+ and expressed in Escherichia coli. The purified recombinant CrusEs2 inhibited the growth of Gram-positive bacteria at MIC of 0.093-0.37 muM. The results indicated that CrusEs2 was involved in immune response of E. sinensis against bacterial challenge.
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial activities of hexahydroimidazo[1,5-a]pyridinium bromides with varying benzyl substituents.
AB  - Variously substituted benzyl bromides were employed to quaternize hexahydrobenzylimidazo[1,5-a]pyridine (A) and the resulting bromides (1-11) were evaluated for their in vitro antimicrobial activity against 10 pathogenic microorganisms: Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacillus cereus, Micrococcus luteus, Proteus vulgaris, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Klebsiella pneumonia, Candida albicans and Candida krusei. Antimicrobial activities were surprisingly high (MIC: 0.78-400 mug/mL) and the sensitivity of the salts tested has been found to depend strongly both on the benzyl substituents and the microorganisms used. However, the correlation observed between antimicrobial activity and calculated partition coefficient (ClogP) was poor. Acute toxicity assessment of these salts showed LD(50) of 757-2000 mg/kg, after oral administration in mice in 24h.
TI  - Synthesis, antimicrobial activity and cytotoxicity of novel oxadiazole derivatives.
AB  - In the present study, 5-substituted-1,3,4-oxadiazolin-2-thiones (1a-b) were synthesized via the ring closure reactions of appropriate acid hydrazides with carbon disulphide. N-(Benzothiazol-2-yl)-2-[[5-substituted-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl]sulfanyl]acetamide derivatives (3a-j) were obtained by the nucleophilic substitution reactions of 5-substituted-1,3,4-oxadiazolin-2-thiones (1a-b) with N-(benzothiazol-2-yl)-2-chloroacetamides. The chemical structures of the compounds were elucidated by IR, (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR and FAB(+)-MS spectral data and elemental analyses. The synthesized compounds were screened for their antimicrobial activities against Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes and Candida albicans. All compounds except compound 3h exhibited the highest antibacterial activity against P. aeruginosa. Among all compounds (3a-j), the compounds bearing 4-methoxyphenoxymethyl moiety on oxadiazole ring (3a-e) exhibited the highest inhibitory activity against C. albicans. Although compound 3j did not possess 4-methoxyphenoxymethyl moiety on oxadiazole ring, this derivative also exhibited the same level of anti-candidal activity. The compounds were also investigated for their cytotoxic effects using MTT (3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay. Compound 3a exhibited the highest cytotoxic activity, whereas compound 3g possessed the lowest cytotoxic activity against NIH/3T3 cells.
TI  - Obtaining antimicrobial peptides by controlled peptic hydrolysis of bovine hemoglobin.
AB  - Under standard conditions, the peptides and specially the active peptides were obtained from either the denatured hemoglobin that all structures are completely modified or either the native hemoglobin where all structures are intact. In these conditions, antibacterial peptides were isolated from a very complex peptidic hydrolysate which contains more than one hundred peptides having various sizes and characteristics, involving a complex purification process. The new hydrolysis conditions were obtained by using 40% methanol, 30% ethanol, 20% propanol or 10% butanol. These conditions, where only the secondary structure of hemoglobin retains intact, were followed in order to enrich the hydrolyzed hemoglobin by active peptides or obtain new antibacterial peptides. In these controlled peptic hydrolysis of hemoglobin, a selective and restrictive hydrolysate contained only 29 peptides was obtained. 26 peptides have an antibacterial activity against Micrococcus luteus, Listeria innocua, and Escherichia coli with MIC from 187.1 to 1 muM. Among these peptides, 13 new antibacterial peptides are obtained only in these new hydrolysis conditions.
TI  - Characterisation of immune responses in the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum.
AB  - The innate immune system of insects provides effective defence against a range of parasites and pathogens. The pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum, is a novel study system for investigating host-parasite interactions due to its complex associations with both well-characterised bacterial symbionts and a diversity of pathogens and parasites, including several important biological control agents. However, little is known about the cellular and humoral immune responses of aphids. Here we identify three morphologically distinct types of haemocytes in circulation that we name prohemocytes, granulocytes and oenocytoids. Granulocytes avidly phagocytose Gram negative Escherechia coli and Gram positive Micrococcus luteus while oenocytoids exhibit melanotic activity. Prohaemocytes increase in abundance immediately following an immune challenge, irrespective of the source of stimulus. Pea aphids form melanotic capsules around Sephadex beads but do not form cellular capsules. We also did not detect any antimicrobial peptide activity in the haemolymph using zone of inhibition assays. We discuss these results in relation to recent findings from the pea aphid genome annotation project that suggest that aphids have a reduced immune gene repertoire compared to other insects.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of the essential oil of Greek endemic Stachys spruneri and its main component, isoabienol.
AB  - The essential oils of Stachys spruneri Boiss. (sample A and sample B) were analyzed by GC and GC-MS. (+)-Isoabienol was the dominant component (49.5 and 48.2%, respectively of the total oils) among seventy-two identified constituents. Isoabienol was separated, purified by preparative thin-layer chromatography, and further identified by means ofphysicochemical and spectrometric analysis. The microbial growth inhibitory properties of the essential oil and its main metabolite, the labdane diterpene isoabienol, were determined using the broth microdilution method against eight laboratory strains of bacteria (Gram-positive: Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Micrococcus luteus, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis, and Gram- negative: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and two strains of the yeast Candida albicans. Both essential oil and isoabienol showed considerable activity against all the microorganisms tested, with the isolated compound being most active.
TI  - Synthesis and in vitro microbiological evaluation of novel diethyl 6,6'-(1,4-phenylene)bis(4-aryl-2-oxo-cyclohex-3-enecarboxylates).
AB  - Novel bis cyclohexenone ester derivatives 14-19 were synthesized and characterized by their spectral data. In vitro microbiological evaluations were carried out for all the novel compounds 14-19 against clinically isolated bacterial and fungal strains. Compounds 15, 16, 18 against Staphylococcus aureus, 14, 15 against beta-Haemolytic streptococcus, 15, 19 against Micrococcus luteus, 17, 18 against Salmonella typhii, 14, 17 against Shigella flexneri, 15 against Escherichia coli, 16 against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 15, 18, 19 against Klebsiella pneumonia exhibited potent antibacterial activity at an minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) value of 6.25 mug/ml, whereas compound 16 against Aspergillus flavus, 17 against A. niger, 16, 18 against Mucor indicus, 15, 17-19 against Microsporum gypseum revealed excellent antifungal activity at an MIC value of 6.25 mug/ml.
TI  - Effect of calcium and magnesium on the antimicrobial action of enterocin LR/6 produced by Enterococcus faecium LR/6.
AB  - Enterococci are well-known producers of antimicrobial peptides (enterocins) that  possess potential as biopreservatives in food. In this study, divalent cations and release of intracellular potassium were used to assess the mechanism of interaction and killing of enterocin LR/6 produced by Enterococcus faecium LR/6 on three target Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, namely Micrococcus luteus, Enterococcus sp. strain LR/3 and Escherichia coli K-12. Whilst treatment with enterocin LR/6 in all cases led to a significant loss of viability, suggesting a bactericidal mode of action, E. coli K-12 showed better tolerance than the other two strains. Bacteriocins have generally been reported to create pores in the membrane of sensitive cells and this function is diminished by divalent cations. In this study it was shown that Ca(2+) and Mg(2+) markedly improved the viability of enterocin LR/6-treated cells in a concentration-dependent manner. K(+) release as a sign of membrane leakiness was higher in M. luteus compared with the other two test strains. In agreement with the viability response, pre-exposure to Ca(2+) and Mg(2+) substantially reduced the amount of K(+) leakage by M. luteus and Enterococcus sp.; in the case of E. coli K-12, no leakage of K(+) was recorded. These results suggest that enterocin LR/6, which possesses good antibacterial potential, may not be very effective as a preservative in foods containing high concentrations of calcium and magnesium.
TI  - Antioxidant and antibacterial characteristics of phenolic extracts of locally produced honey in Saudi Arabia.
AB  - The antibacterial and antioxidant properties of 30 selected honey samples produced in Saudi Arabia have been studied. The inhibitory action of the total phenolic content of the honey samples has been tested against Staphylococcus aureus, Micrococcus luteus and Escherichia coli. The MIC values of the ten selected honey samples against S. aureus, M. luteus and E. coli were in the range 0.5 +/- 0.2 - 3.6 +/- 0.3; 0.45 +/- 0.05 - 5.0 +/- 0.6 and 0.6 +/- 0.2 - 4.4 +/- 0.4 mg mL(- 1). The antioxidant activities of the ethyl acetate extracts based on their anti-radical power using the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl scavenging assay and their ferric reducing antioxidant power were in the ranges 50.78 +/- 1.4% to 99.52 +/- 0.2% and 0.85 +/- 0.13 to 1.167 +/- 0.13 mg/ml, respectively. The total phenolic content was in the range 84.97 +/- 0.57 to 317.39 +/- 0.76 mg/100 g.
TI  - Antibacterial action of acetic acid soluble material isolated from Mucor rouxii and its application onto textile.
AB  - Acetic acid soluble material (AcSM) is a chitosan-rich fraction isolated from the fungal cell wall materials. The final step in the traditional production of fungal chitosan is the separation of chitosan from the cell wall AcSM via raising the pH to 9-10 followed by centrifugation. This step results in further undesirable economic and environmental effects. The goal of this paper is to avoid that by investigating the antimicrobial effect of the whole AcSM from Mucor rouxii DSM-1191 cell wall and its application on cotton fabrics. The treated fabrics were characterized through monitoring the textile physical properties and for the antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli and Micrococcus luteus. Results showed that Mucor rouxii DSM-1191 has excellent potentials to be used for cell wall AcSM production on industrial scale with a maximum content of 40% in dry mycelia. The obtained results indicated that the physical properties of the treated fabrics, as well as the antibacterial activity, were improved after treatment with fungal AcSM.
TI  - Antibacterial efficacy of raw and processed honey.
AB  - In vitro antibacterial activity of methanol, ethanol, and ethyl acetate extracts  of raw and processed honey was tested against Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Micrococcus luteus) and Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella typhi). Both types of honey showed antibacterial activity against tested organisms with the zone of inhibition (ZOI) ranging from 6.94 to 37.94 mm, while E. coli, S. typhi, and P. aeruginosa showed that sensibility towards all the extracts with ZOI ranges between 13.09 to 37.94 mm. The methanol extract showed more potent activity than other organic extracts. Gram-negative bacteria were found to be more susceptible as compared to Gram-positive bacteria except E. faecalis. The broth microdilution assay gave minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) value of 625 mug/mL, while the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) ranges between 625 mug/mL 2500 mug/mL. The study showed that honey has antibacterial activity (bacteriostatic and bactericidal effect), similar to antibiotics, against test organisms and provides alternative therapy against certain bacteria.
TI  - Continuous control of the flow in biochemical pathways through 5' untranslated region sequence modifications in mRNA expressed from the broad-host-range promoter Pm.
AB  - The inducible Pm promoter integrated into broad-host-range plasmid RK2 replicons  can be fine-tuned continuously between the uninduced and maximally induced levels by varying the inducer concentrations. To lower the uninduced background level while still maintaining the inducibility for applications in, for example, metabolic engineering and synthetic (systems) biology, we report here the use of mutations in the Pm DNA region corresponding to the 5' untranslated region of mRNA (UTR). Five UTR variants obtained by doped oligonucleotide mutagenesis and selection, apparently reducing the efficiency of translation, were all found to display strongly reduced uninduced expression of three different reporter genes (encoding beta-lactamase, luciferase, and phosphoglucomutase) in Escherichia coli. The ratio between induced and uninduced expression remained the same or higher compared to cells containing a corresponding plasmid with the wild-type UTR. Interestingly, the UTR variants also displayed similar effects on expression when substituted for the native UTR in another and constitutive promoter, P1 (P(antitet)), indicating a broad application potential of these UTR variants. Two of the selected variants were used to control the production of the C(50) carotenoid sarcinaxanthin in an engineered strain of E. coli that produces the precursor lycopene. Sarcinaxanthin is produced in this particular strain by expressing three Micrococcus luteus derived genes from the promoter Pm. The results indicated that UTR variants can be used to eliminate sarcinaxanthin production under uninduced conditions, whereas cells containing the corresponding plasmid with a wild-type UTR produced ca. 25% of the level observed under induced conditions.
TI  - Recognition of microbial molecular patterns and stimulation of prophenoloxidase activation by a beta-1,3-glucanase-related protein in Manduca sexta larval plasma.
AB  - Detection of pathogenic invaders is the essential first step of a successful defense response in multicellular organisms. In this study, we have identified a new member of the beta-1,3-glucanase-related protein superfamily from the tobacco hornworm Manduca sexta. This protein, designated microbe binding protein (MBP), is 61% identical in sequence to Bombyx mori Gram-negative bacteria binding protein, but only 34-36% identical to M. sexta beta-1,3-glucan recognition protein-1 and 2. Its mRNA levels were strongly up-regulated in hemocytes and fat body of immune challenged larvae, along with an increase in concentration of the plasma protein. We expressed M. sexta MBP in a baculovirus-insect cell system. The purified protein associated with intact bacteria and fungi. It specifically bound to lipoteichoic acid, lipopolysaccharide, diaminopimelic acid-type peptidoglycans (DAP-PGs) from Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis, but less so to laminarin or Lys-type PG from Staphylococcus aureus. The complex binding pattern was influenced by other plasma factors and additional microbial surface molecules. After different amounts of MBP had been incubated with larval plasma on ice, a concentration-dependent increase in phenoloxidase (PO) activity occurred in the absence of any microbial elicitor. The activity increase was also observed in the mixture of plasma and a bacterial or fungal cell wall component. The prophenoloxidase (proPO) activation became more prominent when DAP-PGs, Micrococcus luteus Lys-PG, or lipoteichoic acid was included in the mixture of MBP and plasma. Statistic analysis suggested that a synergistic enhancement of proPO activation was caused by an interaction between MBP and these elicitors, but not S. aureus Lys-PG, lipopolysaccharide, curdlan, or laminarin. These data indicate that M. sexta MBP is a component of the surveillance mechanism and, by working together with other pattern recognition molecules and serine proteinases, triggers the proPO activation system.
TI  - Minimal antimicrobial peptidic sequence from hemoglobin alpha-chain: KYR.
AB  - Hemoglobin is an animal protein described as a source of biologically active peptides. Peptic digestion of bovine hemoglobin alpha-chain allowed obtaining peptide fractions with antimicrobial activity. These peptides were purified by reverse-phase High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) and characterized by mass spectrometry. The minimal inhibitory concentration and mode of action of these peptides were studied against five bacterial strains including Escherichia coli and Salmonella enteritidis as Gram-negative bacteria and Listeria innocua, Micrococcus luteus and Staphylococcus aureus as Gram-positive bacteria. The action aforementioned peptides were studied on artificial membranes as well. The most active peptides resulted to be the short ones. Consequently, the minimal peptidic sequence necessary for the antibacterial activity was clearly determined: KYR.
TI  - Polymer/bacteria composite nanofiber non-wovens by electrospinning of living bacteria protected by hydrogel microparticles.
AB  - Physically crosslinked PVA-hydrogel microparticles are utilized for encapsulation of E. coli and M. luteus. The bacteria survive dry storage or treatment with bacteria-hostile organic solvents significantly better than unprotected bacteria as proven by culture-test experiments. The bacteria-protecting PVA microparticles are available for standard polymer-solution-processing techniques, as exemplarily shown by co-electrospinning of living bacteria encapsulated in dry PVA-hydrogel microparticles together with PVB-, PLLA-, and PCL-form organic solvents.
TI  - Synthesis and evaluation of a class of new coumarin triazole derivatives as potential antimicrobial agents.
AB  - A series of new coumarin-based 1,2,4-triazole derivatives were designed, synthesized and evaluated for their antimicrobial activities in vitro against four Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, MRSA, Bacillus subtilis and Micrococcus luteus), four Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, Salmonella typhi and Shigella dysenteriae) as well as three fungi (Candida albicans, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Aspergillus fumigatus) by two-fold serial dilution technique. The bioactive assay showed that some synthesized coumarin triazoles displayed comparable or even better antibacterial and antifungal efficacy in comparison with reference drugs Enoxacin, Chloromycin and Fluconazole. Coumarin bis-triazole compounds exhibited stronger antibacterial and antifungal efficiency than their corresponding mono-triazole derivatives.
TI  - Gram-negative and gram-positive antibacterial properties of the whole plant extract of willow herb (Epilobium angustifolium).
AB  - The emergence of new pathogens and the increase in the number of multidrug-resistant strains in well-established pathogens during the past decade represent a growing public health concern globally. With the current lack of research and development of new antibiotics by large pharmaceutical companies due to poor financial returns, new alternatives need to be explored including natural herbal or plant-based extracts with reported antibacterial properties. Willow herb (Epilobium angustifolium) preparations have been used in traditional aboriginal and folk medicine preparations externally as an antiphlogistic to treat prostate and gastrointestinal disorders and as an antiseptic to treat infected wounds. The authors hypothesized that a whole plant extract of willow herb would exhibit antimicrobial properties on a variety of both Gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria in culture. The authors found that, in comparison to growth controls, willow herb extract significantly inhibited the growth of Micrococcus luteus (p < .01), Staphylococcus aureus (p < .05), Escherichia coli (p < .001), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (p < .001). They also found that willow herb extract inhibited the growth of bacteria in culture more effectively than vancomycin (p < .05) or tetracycline (p < .004). These results provide preliminary support for the traditional folkloric claim that the plant willow herb possesses antibacterial properties against a variety of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Given that whole plant extract was utilized for this study, further investigations are warranted to determine which specific part of the plant (i.e., leaves, stem, roots, and flowers) possess the antibacterial properties.
TI  - Effect of flash-heat treatment on antimicrobial activity of breastmilk.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The World Health Organization recommends human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive mothers in resource-poor regions heat-treat expressed breastmilk during periods of increased maternal-to-child transmission risk. Flash-heat, a "low tech" pasteurization method, inactivates HIV, but effects on milk protein bioactivity are unknown. The objectives were to measure flash-heat's effect on antimicrobial properties of lactoferrin, lysozyme, and whole milk and on the digestive resistance of lactoferrin and lysozyme. METHODS: Flash-heated and unheated breastmilk aliquots from HIV-positive mothers in South Africa were "spiked" with Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli and then cultured for 0, 3, and 6 hours. Lysozyme and lactoferrin activities were determined by lysis of Micrococcus luteus cells and inhibition of enteropathogenic E. coli, respectively, measured spectrophotometrically. Percentages of proteins surviving in vitro digestion, lactoferrin and lysozyme activity, and bacteriostatic activity of whole milk in heated versus unheated samples were compared. RESULTS: There was no difference in rate of growth of E. coli or S. aureus in flash-heated versus unheated whole milk (p = 0.61 and p = 0.96, respectively). Mean (95% confidence interval) antibacterial activity of lactoferrin was diminished 11.1% (7.8%, 14.3%) and that of lysozyme by up to 56.6% (47.1%, 64.5%) by flash-heat. Digestion of lysozyme was unaffected (p = 0.12), but 25.4% less lactoferrin survived digestion (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: In summary, flash-heat resulted in minimally decreased lactoferrin and moderately decreased lysozyme bioactivity, but bacteriostatic activity of whole milk against representative bacteria was unaffected. This suggests flash-heated breastmilk likely has a similar profile of resistance to bacterial contamination as that of unheated milk. Clinical significance of the decreased bioactivity should be tested in clinical trials.
TI  - Enzymes of SPZ7 phage: isolation and properties.
AB  - Bacteriophage enzyme preparations exolysin and endolysin were studied. Exolysin (a phage-associated enzyme) was obtained from tail fraction and endolysin from phage-free cytoplasmic fraction of disintegrated Salmonella enteritidis cells. A new method for purification of these enzymes was developed, and their molecular masses were determined. The main catalytic properties of the studied enzymes (pH optimum and specificity to bacterial substrates) were found to be similar. Both enzymes lyse Escherichia coli cells like chicken egg lysozyme, but more efficiently lyse S. enteritidis cells and cannot lyse Micrococcus luteus, a good substrate for chicken egg lysozyme. Similar properties of exolysin and endolysin suggest that these enzymes are structurally similar or even identical.
TI  - Bacterial tolerance to silver nanoparticles (SNPs): aeromonas punctata isolated from sewage environment.
AB  - Use of silver nanoparticles (SNPs) is increasing in a large number of consumer products. Thus, the possible build-up of the nanoparticles in the environment is becoming a major concern. Aeromonas punctata isolated from sewage showed tolerance to 200 mug/ml SNPs. The growth kinetics data for A. punctata treated with nanoparticles were similar to those in the absence of nanoparticles. There was a reduction in the amount of exopolysaccharides (EPS) in bacterial culture supernatant after nanoparticle-supernatant interaction. EPS capping of the nanoparticles was confirmed by UV-visible, XRD and comparative FTIR analysis. The EPS-capped SNPs showed less toxicity to Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Micrococcus luteus compared to the uncapped ones. The study suggests capping of nanoparticles by bacterially produced EPS as a probable physiological defense mechanism.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of the latex of Argemone ochroleuca Sweet.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the antibacterial effect of the crude latex of Argemone ochroleuca (A. ochroleuca) as antibacterial potential against a range of human pathogenic bacteria. METHODS: This study was carried out at King Khalid University, Abha, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia from January to March 2010. Seventeen ml of fresh latex from A. ochroleuca Sweet was collected, and the antibacterial activity of crude and diluted latex were examined using one ml of standardized inoculum suspension, and using the agar diffusion method test against Bacillus subtilis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Micrococcus luteus, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus. All inoculated plates were incubated aerobically at 290C for 48 hours. The diameter of the zones of inhibition was measured to the nearest mm. RESULTS: The crude latex of A. ochroleuca exhibited a potent antibacterial effect on all bacterial strains examined. The zones of inhibition against the tested bacteria were found in the range of 9.30 - 40.3 mm along with their respective minimum inhibitory concentration values 100 ul/ml. CONCLUSION: The observable inhibition on selected bacteria by latex of A. ochroleuca makes it a promising alternative as a potential source of natural antibacterial.
TI  - Antibacterial effects of the essential oils of commonly consumed medicinal herbs  using an in vitro model.
AB  - The chemical composition and antibacterial activity of essential oils from 10 commonly consumed herbs: Citrus aurantium, C. limon, Lavandula angustifolia, Matricaria chamomilla, Mentha piperita, M. spicata, Ocimum basilicum, Origanum vulgare, Thymus vulgaris and Salvia officinalis have been determined. The antibacterial activity of these oils and their main components; i.e. camphor, carvacrol, 1,8-cineole, linalool, linalyl acetate, limonene, menthol, a-pinene, b-pinene, and thymol were assayed against the human pathogenic bacteria Bacillus subtilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Micrococcus flavus, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enteritidis, S. epidermidis, S. typhimurium, and Staphylococcus aureus. The highest and broadest activity was shown by O. vulgare oil. Carvacrol had the highest antibacterial activity among the tested components.
TI  - Heterogeneous precipitation of silver nanoparticles on kaolinite plates.
AB  - Two different methods to obtain silver nanoparticles supported on kaolin crystals have been performed: the first one followed a thermal reduction and the second one a chemical reduction. In both cases, the silver nanoparticles with two different average particles size (ca.12 and 30 nm) were perfectly isolated and attached to the surface of the kaolin plates. The silver nanoparticles were localized mainly at the edge of the single crystal plates, the hydroxyl groups being the main centres of adsorption. The samples were fully characterized by XRD, UV-vis spectroscopy and TEM. The antimicrobial benefits of the composites were evaluated as antibacterial against common Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, and antifungal activity against yeast. The results indicated a high antimicrobial activity for Escherichia coli JM 110 and Micrococcus luteus, while being inactive against yeast under our experimental conditions. The chemical analysis of Ag in the fermentation broths show that only a small portion of metal (<9 ppm) is released from the kaolin/metakaolin particles. Therefore, the risk of toxicity due to a high concentration of metal in the medium is minimized.
TI  - Abyssomicin I, a modified polycyclic polyketide from Streptomyces sp. CHI39.
AB  - Abyssomicin I (1), a new modified polycyclic polyketide, was isolated from the culture extract of a soil-derived Streptomyces sp. The structure of 1 was elucidated by interpretation of NMR and other spectroscopic data. The stereochemistry of the new compound was assigned by NOE analysis, chemical derivatization, and application of the modified Mosher method. While 1 was inactive against bacteria and yeasts, the oxidized derivative 7 showed weak activities against gram-positive bacteria. Compounds 1 and 7 exhibited inhibitory effects on tumor cell invasion with IC(50) values of 11 and 0.21 muM, respectively.
TI  - Involvement of apolipophorin III in antibacterial defense of Galleria mellonella  larvae.
AB  - Apolipophorin III (apoLp-III) is an abundant hemolymph protein involved in lipid  transport and immune response in insects. We investigated involvement of apoLp-III in the antibacterial response in Galleria mellonella larvae. Immune challenge with Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae) and Gram-positive (Micrococcus luteus) bacteria led to an increase in the level of apoLp-III in G. mellonella hemolymph, 0.5-2h and 8h after treatment, respectively. ApoLp-III purified from larval hemolymph as well as that present in hemolymph extracts adsorbed on the surface of different bacteria. The adsorption capacity of apoLp-III on bacterial cells prompted us to investigate the effect of this phenomenon on bacterial growth. Our results demonstrate antibacterial activity of apoLp-III against selected Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria in vitro. Among bacteria tested, Salmonella typhimurium and K. pneumoniae were the most sensitive to apoLp-III. LIVE/DEAD staining of bacteria incubated with purified apoLp-III revealed their growth inhibition; however, neither morphological changes in the cell shape nor formation of cell aggregates was noticed. The results suggest that apoLp-III is a multifunctional protein in G. mellonella hemolymph.
TI  - Bacteriostatic activity of the proregion of human hepcidin.
AB  - Hepcidin was first identified as an antimicrobial peptide expressed in the liver. It was later demonstrated that hepcidin is in fact the long sought hormone that regulates iron homeostasis in mammals. Hepcidin is encoded as an 84 amino acid prepropeptide that is successively cleaved to yield prohepcidin and the mature 25 amino acid hepcidin. Both the bioactive 25-aa hepcidin and the 35-aa proregion are secreted by liver hepatocytes. The aim of the present study was to assess the antibacterial activity of the proregion peptide from human hepcidin. Using a chemically synthesized peptide corresponding to the proregion, we show that it is bactericidal against Bacillus megaterium (25microM), and inhibits Bacillus subtilis growth at high concentration (200microM). No synergistic interaction of proregion and Hepc25 against Bacillus megaterium was seen. In a further step, the mode of action of proregion on Bacillus megaterium was studied. It caused a slow accumulation of the vital stain SYTOX in the bacteria, indicating that it did not destroy the microbial membranes through a detergent-like mechanism, even at concentrations (80microM) higher than those required to kill the bacteria. This result suggests that the target of proregion might be an intracellular component. Finally, gel retardation assay showed that the DNA binding ability of the hepcidin proregion was equivalent to that observed for magainin 2, an antimicrobial peptide which exerts its antimicrobial effect by interfering with intracellular nucleic acids. In conclusion, we speculate that the proregion of hepcidin may have bacteriostatic effects, and as such may contribute to the innate immune response.
TI  - A well protected intruder: the effective antimicrobial defense of the invasive ladybird Harmonia axyridis.
AB  - The harlequin ladybird Harmonia axyridis (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) is a polyphagous predatory beetle native to Central and Eastern Asia. Since 2007 it has established all over Central Europe. In order to elucidate which defense strategy is responsible for its high resistance to diseases, we tested hemolymph as well as eleven main components of the headspace of H. axyridis for antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive (Bacillus subtilis, B. thuringiensis ssp. tenebrionis, Micrococcus luteus) and Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli) and yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). While three of the volatile compounds weakly reduced the growth of microorganisms, hemolymph of adults and larvae of H. axyridis strongly inhibited the growth of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria as well as yeast. Furthermore, we compared the antimicrobial activity in the hemolymph of H. axyridis and Coccinella septempunctata. Antimicrobial activity in H. axyridis was about a thousand times higher compared to hemolymph from C. septempunctata. In contrast to C. septempunctata, the antimicrobial activity in H. axyridis was present without prior challenge. Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the hemolymph of H. axyridis was lowest against E. coli and yeast followed by B. subtilis, and was highest against entomopathogenic B. thuringiensis ssp. tenebrionidae. Furthermore, MIC values of the hemolymph obtained from live beetles were significantly lower than from frozen insects. This suggests that the active antimicrobial compound is affected by freezing and subsequent thawing of the beetles. Potential implications of our findings for the competitive advantages of H. axyridis over C. septempunctata are discussed.
TI  - Screening of the constituents, antimicrobial and antioxidant activity of endemic  Origanum hypericifolium O. Schwartz & P.H. Davis.
AB  - The chemical compositions, total phenol content, antioxidant and antimicrobial activities with oxidant status of the essential oil from an endemic Turkish species, Origanum hypericifolium, were investigated. Steam distillation (SD) was used to isolate the essential oils, and the chemical analyses were performed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The antimicrobial activity was tested by agar disc diffusion method against Morganella morganii (clinic isolate), Micrococcus flavus (clinic isolate), Micrococcus luteus NRLL B-4375, Proteus vulgaris RSKK 96026, Escherichia coli ATCC 11230, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Yersinia enterecolitica RSKK 1501, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, S. aureus ATCC 25933, S. aureus ATCC 12598, S. aureus (clinic isolate), MRSA 1 (clinic isolate), MRSA 2 (clinic isolate), MRSA 3 (clinic isolate) and MRSA 4 (clinic isolate). The major compounds found in volatiles of O. hypericifolium were p-cymene, carvacrol and gamma-terpinene. Results showed that O. hypericifolium has the potential for being used in food and medicine because of its antioxidant and antibacterial activity.
TI  - Biosynthetic pathway for gamma-cyclic sarcinaxanthin in Micrococcus luteus: heterologous expression and evidence for diverse and multiple catalytic functions of C(50) carotenoid cyclases.
AB  - We report the cloning and characterization of the biosynthetic gene cluster (crtE, crtB, crtI, crtE2, crtYg, crtYh, and crtX) of the gamma-cyclic C(50) carotenoid sarcinaxanthin in Micrococcus luteus NCTC2665. Expression of the complete and partial gene cluster in Escherichia coli hosts revealed that sarcinaxanthin biosynthesis from the precursor molecule farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) proceeds via C(40) lycopene, C(45) nonaflavuxanthin, C(50) flavuxanthin, and C(50) sarcinaxanthin. Glucosylation of sarcinaxanthin was accomplished by the crtX gene product. This is the first report describing the biosynthetic pathway of a gamma-cyclic C(50) carotenoid. Expression of the corresponding genes from the marine M. luteus isolate Otnes7 in a lycopene-producing E. coli host resulted in the production of up to 2.5 mg/g cell dry weight sarcinaxanthin in shake flasks. In an attempt to experimentally understand the specific difference between the biosynthetic pathways of sarcinaxanthin and the structurally related epsilon-cyclic decaprenoxanthin, we constructed a hybrid gene cluster with the gamma-cyclic C(50) carotenoid cyclase genes crtYg and crtYh from M. luteus replaced with the analogous epsilon-cyclic C(50) carotenoid cyclase genes crtYe and crtYf from the natural decaprenoxanthin producer Corynebacterium glutamicum. Surprisingly, expression of this hybrid gene cluster in an E. coli host resulted in accumulation of not only decaprenoxanthin, but also sarcinaxanthin and the asymmetric epsilon- and gamma-cyclic C(50) carotenoid sarprenoxanthin, described for the first time in this work. Together, these data contributed to new insight into the diverse and multiple functions of bacterial C(50) carotenoid cyclases as key catalysts for the synthesis of structurally different carotenoids.
TI  - Antimicrobial and anticancer efficacy of antineoplastic agent capped gold nanoparticles.
AB  - Synthesis of thioguanine (TG)-capped Au nanoparticles (Au@TG) and their enhanced  in vitro antimicrobial and anticancer efficacy against Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, E. coli, Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus niger and Hep2 cancer cell (Human epidermiod cell) have been reported. The nature of binding between 6-TG and the gold nanoparticles via complexation is investigated using ultraviolet-visible spectrum, cyclic voltammetry, transmission electron microscopy, fluorescence and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. The present experimental studies suggests that Au@TG are more potential than TG towards antimicrobial and anticancer activities. Hence, gold nanoparticles have the potential to be used as effective carriers for anticancer drug.
TI  - A new laboratory cultivation of Paramecium bursaria using non-pathogenic bacteria strains.
AB  - In most studies dealing with the laboratory cultivation of paramecia (Paramecium  bursaria), Klebsiella pneumoniae bacteria are used to inoculate the medium. However, Klebsiella pneumoniae is a typical pathogen, and its use is always associated with a risk of infection. The aim of the present research was to examine non-pathogenic bacteria strains as components of the medium for Paramecium bursaria. The paramecia were incubated on lettuce infusions bacterized with different bacteria strains: Bacillus subtilis DSM 10, Bacillus megaterium DSM 32, Escherichia coli DSM 498, Micrococcus luteus DSM 348. A strain derived from the natural habitat of Paramecium bursaria was used as the control one. Experiments were conducted under constant light and in the dark. Paramecia cells were counted under a stereomicroscope on consecutive days of incubation. The obtained results show that the most intensive growth of Paramecium bursaria occurs in the presence of Escherichia coli DSM 498. The use of this strain as a component of the medium allows one to obtain a high number of ciliates regardless of the light conditions. It can be concluded that the Paramecium bursaria cultivation procedure can be modified by using the non-pathogenic bacteria strain Escherichia coli DSM 498 instead of Klebsiella pneumoniae.
TI  - [Effect of immunization on the in vivo immunocytes reaction to foreign particles  in the larvae of the flesh fly Calliphora vomitoria].
AB  - Bacterial immunization of Calliphora vomitoria larvae induces hemocytic defense reaction in response to abiotic foreign particles injections. This reaction depends on the larval age and, consequently, the immunocytes composition. The juvenile plasmatocytes which are abundantly present in the end feeding and crop emptying larvae are initially very active and their reaction rate does not depend on the immunization. The plasmatocytes I appear after crop emptying. Immunization has a positive effect on their differentiation rate and, correspondently, the rapid progress in the defense response. The proportion of competent plasmatocytes in immunized larvae increases. The stable hyaline cells formation also depends on immunization, although elements of this response vary at different age steps. immunization of the end feeding and crop emptying larvae induces an increase in the percentage of hyaline cells, but alien particles injection does not provide additional stimulating effect. After crop emptying, immunization of wandering larvae ceases to exert an obvious direct influence, but significantly increases the sensitivity to charcoal injection. The emergence of foreign particles in the hemolymph of immunized wandering larvae causes a rapid increase in the number of hyaline cells due to prohemocytes and undifferentiated plasmatocytes differentiation.
TI  - [Agglutination and phagocytosis of foreign abiotic particles by bluebottle Calliphora vicina haemocytes in vivo. II. Influence of the previous septic immune induction on haemocytic activity].
AB  - The rate of Calliphora vicina haemocytic defense reaction to foreign particles injection depends on the larval age and on the previous bacterial immunization. Immunization of crop-empting larvae induces an evident increase in particles phagocytosis by juvenile plasmatocytes in 24 h after injection. Both the hemogram and the pattern of cellular defense reaction change significantly after crop-empting. Immunized larvae start intensive adhesion of foreign particles to plasmatocytes surface and formation of great aggregations of plasmatocytes (morules) no longer than in 34 min after injection. The period of particle-haemocyte adhesion is short-termed and no more than after 30 min cell aggregates dissociate and adhered charcoal particles pass to thrombocydoidal agglutinates. Unimmunized control larvae of the same age have shown no adhesion and morules formation. In immunized wadering and diapausing larvae, formation of capsules consisting of central thrombocydoidal agglutinate filled with alien particles and adherent plasmatocytes I is intensified. In contrast to moru-les, this capsule formation is not accompanied by charcoal particles adhesion to plasmatocytes. Immunization of mature larvae of C. vicina shown no prominent influence on both the rate of phagocytosis and the hyaline cells differentiation. It might be supposed that the receptors system is complex and the immunization both the mechanisms of foreigners recognition (adhesion, morulation and incapsulation) and the far more lately occurring phagocytosis.
TI  - Peptidoglycan recognition protein of Chlamys farreri (CfPGRP-S1) mediates immune  defenses against bacterial infection.
AB  - Peptidoglycan recognition protein (PGRP) is an essential molecule in innate immunity for both invertebrates and vertebrates, owing to its prominent ability in detecting and eliminating the invading bacteria. Several PGRPs have been identified from mollusk, but their functions and the underlined mechanism are still unclear. In the present study, the mRNA expression profiles, location, and possible functions of PGRP-S1 from Zhikong scallop Chlamys farreri (CfPGRP-S1) were analyzed. The CfPGRP-S1 protein located in the mantle, gill, kidney and gonad of the scallops. Its mRNA expression in hemocytes was up-regulated extremely after PGN stimulation (P<0.01), while moderately after the stimulations of LPS (P<0.01) and beta-glucan (P<0.05). The recombinant protein of CfPGRP-S1 (designated as rCfPGRP-S1) exhibited high affinity to PGN and moderate affinity to LPS, but it did not bind beta-glucan. Meanwhile, rCfPGRP-S1 also exhibited strong agglutination activity to Gram-positive bacteria Micrococcus luteus and Bacillus subtilis and weak activity to Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli. More importantly, rCfPGRP-S1 functioned as a bactericidal amidase to degrade PGN and strongly inhibit the growth of E. coli and Staphyloccocus aureus in the presence of Zn(2+). These results indicated that CfPGRP-S1 could not only serve as a pattern recognition receptor recognizing bacterial PGN and LPS, but also function as a scavenger involved in eliminating response against the invaders.
TI  - Lycopersicon esculentum seeds: an industrial byproduct as an antimicrobial agent.
AB  - Lycopersicon esculentum (tomato) fruit is a widely studied matrix. However, only  few works focus their attention on its seeds, which constitute a major byproduct of the tomato processing industry. In this study the antimicrobial potential of ten different tomato seed extracts from "Bull's heart" and "Cherry" varieties were analyzed against Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Micrococcus luteus, Enterococcus faecalis and Bacillus cereus) and Gram-negative (Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella typhimurium) bacteria and fungi (Candida albicans, Aspergillus fumigatus and Trichophyton rubrum). Regarding antibacterial capacity, the different extracts were revealed to be active only against Gram-positive bacteria, E. faecalis being the most susceptible one (MIC: 2.5-10 mg/mL). Concerning antifungal activity, "Bull's heart" extracts were the most active. In a general way C. albicans was the most susceptible species (MIC: 5-10 mg/mL). The chemical composition of the extracts was also pursued, concerning organic acids, phenolics and fatty acids, in order to establish a possible relationship with the observed antimicrobial effect.
TI  - Pyrosequencing and characterization of immune response genes from the American dog tick, Dermacentor variabilis (L.).
AB  - Ticks continue to be a threat to animal and human health, and new and novel control strategies are needed for ticks and tick-borne pathogens. The characterization of the tick-pathogen interface and the tick immune response to microbial infections is fundamental toward the formulation of new control strategies for ticks and the pathogens they transmit. Our overall hypothesis for this research is that the tick immune system manages the maintenance of pathogens. Therefore, discovery of tick immune response genes may provide targets for novel control strategies directed toward reducing vector competency and pathogen transmission. In these studies, 454 pyrosequencing, a high-throughput genomic sequencing method was used to discover tick genes expressed in response to bacterial and fungal infections. Expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were analysed from Dermacentor variabilis ticks that had been injected with bacteria (Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus) or fungi (Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida albicans) and ticks that were naturally infected with the intracellular bacterium, Anaplasma marginale. By this approach, ESTs were assembled into 5995 contigs. Contigs fell into the five main functional categories of metabolism, genetic information processing, environmental information processing, cellular processes and human diseases. We identified more than 30 genes that are likely to encode for proteins involved in tick immune function. We further analysed by reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) the expression of 22 of these genes in each of our bacterial or fungal treatment groups and found that seven were up-regulated. Up-regulation of these seven genes was confirmed for bacterial, but not fungal treatment by quantitative PCR (qPCR). One of these products was novel, encoding a new tick defensin. Our results clearly demonstrate the complexities of the tick immune system and mark new directions for further study and characterization of proteins that modulate microbial infections in the American dog tick.
TI  - Chemical composition and antibacterial activity of essential oils of Lantana camara, Ageratum houstonianum and Eupatorium adenophorum.
AB  - Essential oils have applications in folk medicine, food preservation, and as feed additives. The essential oils of Lantana camara Linn. (Verbenaceae), Ageratum houstonianum Mill. (Asteraceae) and Eupatorium adenophorum Spreng. (Asteraceae) were analyzed by Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GCMS). In L. camara oil, of the total identified (83.91%) volatile constituents, five constituents [3,7,11-trimethyl-1,6,10-dodecatriene (28.86%), beta-caryophyllene (12.28%), zingiberene (7.63%), gamma-curcumene (7.50%) and alpha-humulene (3.99%)] represented the major ones. In A. houstonianum oil, among the total identified volatile constituents (94.51%), three [precocene-II (52.64%), precocene-I (22.45%) and beta-caryophyllene (9.66%)] represented the major ones. In E. adenophorum oil, of the total identified volatile constituents (84.95%), six [1-napthalenol (17.50%), alpha-bisabolol (9.53%), bornyl acetate (8.98%), beta-bisabolene (6.16%), germacrene-D (5.74%) and alpha- phellandrene (3.85%)] represented the major ones. The antibacterial activity expressed as Minimum Bactericidal Concentration (MBC) (microg/mL) was determined by the broth dilution method. The essential oil of E. adenophorum had antibacterial activity against Arthrobacter protophormiae, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, Rhodococcus rhodochrous, and Staphylococcus aureus with MBC values of 200, 100, 100, 12.5, and 200, respectively. The essential oil of A. houstonianum showed antibacterial activity against M. luteus and R. rhodochrous with MBC of 100 and 12.5, but not against A. protophormiae, E. coli, and S. aureus. The essential oil of L. camara showed antibacterial activity against A. protophormiae, M. luteus, R. rhodochrous and S. aureus with MBC of 50, 25, 12.5, and 200, respectively, but not against E. coli. MBC was lowest for R. rhodochrous for all the three essential oils.
TI  - Linum usitatissimum (linseed/flaxseed) fixed oil: antimicrobial activity and efficacy in bovine mastitis.
AB  - PURPOSE: In vitro antimicrobial activity and in vivo therapeutic efficacy of L. usitatissimum (linseed/flaxseed) fixed oil in bovine mastitis were investigated. METHOD: In vitro antimicrobial activity of L. usitatissimum fixed oil was evaluated against a number of microorganisms by disc diffusion method and MIC determination. The in vivo efficacy of the oil was evaluated in nine mastitis-affected cows divided into three groups (three in each group), following once-a-day intramammary infusion of oil, cefoperazone or an oil-cefoperazone combination for 7 days and by monitoring the California mastitis test score, somatic cell count and microbial count in milk samples. RESULTS: The in vitro antimicrobial activity of the oil against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae and Escherichia coli was comparable to that of cefoperazone while the antimicrobial activity against Enterococcus faecalis, Micrococcus luteus and Candida albicans, was greater than that of cefoperazone. In the in vivo study, the oil exhibited significant reduction in the California mastitis test score and somatic cell count in milk samples from infected udders following 7 days of intramammary administration suggesting its anti-inflammatory effect. The microbial count in milk samples was also reduced significantly following oil treatment. The effects were comparable to the treatment by cefoperazone (Mastiwock) alone or in combination with the oil. Apparently, the anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties of the oil contribute to its therapeutic efficacy in mastitis; the oil could be used as an alternative treatment for bovine mastitis CONCLUSION: The results suggest possible therapeutic potential of L. usitatissimum fixed oil in bovine mastitis.
TI  - Synthesis and anti-microbial screening of novel schiff bases of 3-amino-2-methyl  quinazolin 4-(3H)-one.
AB  - In the present study, novel Schiff bases were synthesized by condensation of 3-amino-2-methyl quinazolin-4-(3H)-ones with different aromatic aldehydes. The 3-amino-2-methyl quinazolin-4-(3H)-one was synthesized from anthranilic acid via the 2-methyl benzoxazin-4-one. The chemical structures of the synthesized compounds were confirmed by means of Infrared (IR), (1)H-NMR, (13)C-NMR, Mass spectral, and Elemental analysis. These compounds were screened for anti-bacterial (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 9144, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 155, Micrococcus luteus ATCC 4698, Bacillus cereus ATCC 11778, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 2853, and Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 11298)) and anti-fungal (Aspergillus niger ATCC 9029 and Aspergillus fumigatus ATCC 46645) activities, using the paper disk diffusion technique. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of the compounds were also determined by the agar streak dilution method. Most of the synthesized compounds exhibited significant anti-bacterial and anti-fungal activities. Among the synthesized compounds, 3-(4-hydroxy benzylideneamino)-2-methyl quinazolin-4(3H)-one 4g and 4c was found to exhibit the highest anti-bacterial activity and 3-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxy benzylideneamino)-2-methyl quinazolin-4(3H)-one 4k exhibited the highest anti-fungal activity.
TI  - A different repertoire of Galleria mellonella antimicrobial peptides in larvae challenged with bacteria and fungi.
AB  - To date, functioning of insect humoral immune response is especially well described in Diptera. The mechanisms of pathogen recognition, activation of signaling pathways and regulation of antimicrobial defense peptide expression are relatively well known. The present paper demonstrates evidence that the immune system of the Lepidoptera moth, Galleria mellonella, is also able to distinguish between different classes of microorganisms and responds to the invading pathogen accordingly. G. mellonella larvae were challenged with Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria as well as with yeast and filamentous fungus cells. Subsequently, 24, 48 and 72 h after immunization, the concentrations of lysozyme and six defense peptides were determined in the hemolymph by the HPLC technique. The compounds studied demonstrated variability both in the kinetics of the increase as well as in the concentrations reached. The Gram-negative bacterium and filamentous fungus were particularly effective immunogens, especially affecting the levels of lysozyme, Galleria defensin, proline-rich peptide 2 and cecropin D-like peptide.
TI  - Synthesis, nematicidal and antimicrobial activity of 3-(5-3-methyl-5-[(3-methyl-7-5-[2-(aryl)-4-oxo-1,3-thiazolan-3-yl]-1,3,4-thiadiaz ol-2-ylbenzo[b]furan-5-yl)methyl]benzo[b]furan-7-yl-1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-yl)-2-(ary l)-1,3-thiazolan-4-one.
AB  - A new series of 3-(5-3-methyl-5-[(3-methyl-7-5-[2-(aryl)-4-oxo-1,3-thiazolan-3-yl]-1,3,4-thiadiaz ol-2-ylbenzo[b]furan-5-yl)methyl]benzo[b]furan-7-yl-1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-yl)-2-(ary l)-1,3-thiazolan-4-one 5a-j has been synthesized by the reaction of N2-[(E)-1-(4-methylphenyl)methylidene]-5-(3-methyl-5-[3-methyl-7-(5-[(E)-1-(4-met hylphenyl)methylidene]amino-1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-yl)benzo[b]furan-5-yl]methylbenzo[ b]furan-7-yl)-1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-amine 4a-j with thioglycolic acid. Chemical structures of all the new compounds were established by their IR, 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, MS and elemental data. The 5a-j have been assayed for their nematicidal activity against Ditylenchus myceliophagus and Caenorhabditis elegans by aqueous in vitro screening technique. The screened data reveal that, the 5e is most effective against D. myceliophagus and C. elegans with 50% lethal dose (LD(50)) of 170 and 190 ppm, respectively and is almost equal to the activity of standard levamisole. The 5h and 5j are also most active against C. elegans with LD(50) of 200 ppm and D. myceliophagus with LD(50) of 190 ppm, respectively. Further, the 5a-j were screened for their antibacterial activity against three representative, Gram-positive bacteria viz. Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538p and Micrococcus luteus IFC 12708, and three Gram-negative bacteria viz. Proteus vulgaris ATCC 3851, Salmonella typhimurium ATCC 14028 and Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, and also screened for their antifungal activity against four fungal organisms viz. Candida albicans ATCC 10231, Aspergillus fumigatus HIC 6094, Trichophyton rubrum IFO 9185 and Trichophyton mentagrophytes IFO 40996. Most of these new compounds showed appreciable activity against the test bacteria and fungi, and emerged as potential molecules for further development.
TI  - An insect multiligand recognition protein functions as an opsonin for the phagocytosis of microorganisms.
AB  - We characterize a novel pathogen recognition protein obtained from the lepidopteran Galleria mellonella. This protein recognizes Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, and Candida albicans via specific binding to lipopolysaccharides, lipoteichoic acid, and beta-1,3-glucan, respectively. As a multiligand receptor capable of coping with a broad variety of invading pathogens, it is constitutively produced in the fat body, midgut, and integument but not in the hemocytes and is secreted into the hemolymph. The protein was confirmed to be relevant to cellular immune response and to further function as an opsonin that promotes the uptake of invading microorganisms into hemocytes. Our data reveal that the mechanism by which a multiligand receptor recognizes microorganisms contributes substantially to their phagocytosis by hemocytes. A better understanding of an opsonin with the required repertoire for detecting diverse invaders might provide us with critical insights into the mechanisms underlying insect phagocytosis.
TI  - Structures and antimicrobial activities of pyridoacridine alkaloids isolated from different chromotypes of the ascidian Cystodytes dellechiajei.
AB  - Three new pentacyclic alkaloids were isolated from different chromotypes of the western Mediterranean ascidian Cystodytes dellechiajei. The purple color morph collected in Catalonia contained the known compounds kuanoniamine D (1), shermilamine B (2), N-deacetylkuanoniamine D (3), and styelsamine C (4) and a new alkaloid named N-deacetylshermilamine B (5). The green color morph collected in the Balearic Islands contained the known compounds 11-hydroxyascididemin (6) and 8,9-dihydro-11-hydroxyascididemin (7) and two new alkaloids named cystodimine A (8) and cystodimine B (9). The blue color morph collected in Catalonia yielded the known compound ascididemin (10). The structures of all compounds were elucidated on the basis of spectroscopic data, mainly 1D and 2D NMR data. The antimicrobial potential of the pyridoacridine alkaloids isolated from each color morph was evaluated and compared.
TI  - Involvement of Manduca sexta peptidoglycan recognition protein-1 in the recognition of bacteria and activation of prophenoloxidase system.
AB  - Although the importance of peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRPs) in detecting bacteria and promoting immunity is well recognized in Drosophila melanogaster and other insect species, such a role has not yet been experimentally established for PGRPs in the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta. In this study, we purified M. sexta PGRP1 from the baculovirus-insect cell expression system, tested its association with peptidoglycans and intact bacteria, and explored its possible link with the prophenoloxidase activation system in larval hemolymph. Sequence comparison suggested that PGRP1 is not an amidase and lacks residues for interacting with the carboxyl group of meso-diaminopimelic acid-peptidoglycans (DAP-PGs). M. sexta PGRP1 gene was constitutively expressed at a low level in fat body, and the mRNA concentration became much higher after an injection of Escherichia coli. Consistently, the protein concentration in larval plasma increased in a time-dependent manner after the immune challenge. Purified recombinant PGRP1 specifically bound to soluble DAP-PG of E. coli but not to soluble Lys-type PG of Staphylococcus aureus. In addition, this recognition protein completely bound to insoluble PGs from Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus megaterium and Bacillus subtilis, whereas its association with the bacterial cells was low even though their peptidoglycans are exposed on the cell surface. After PGRP1 had been added to plasma of naive larvae in the absence of microbial elicitor, there was a concentration-dependent increase in prophenoloxidase activation. Phenoloxidase activity, as usual, increased after the plasma was incubated with peptidoglycans or bacterial cells. These increases became more prominent when insoluble M. luteus or B. megaterium PG or soluble E. coli PG and PGRP1 were both present. Statistic analysis suggested a synergistic effect caused by interaction between PGRP1 and these PGs. Taken together, these results indicated that PGRP1 is a member of the M. sexta prophenoloxidase activation system, which recognizes peptidoglycans from certain bacteria and initiates the host defense response. The unexplained difference between the purified PGs and intact bacteria clearly reflects our general lack of understanding of PGRP1-mediated recognition and how it leads to proPO activation.
TI  - Characterization of two crustin antimicrobial peptides from the freshwater crayfish Pacifastacus leniusculus.
AB  - The two bacteria-induced crustin genes, Plcrustin1 and Plcrustin2, previously found in the hemocyte cDNA library of Pacifastacus leniusculus, contain the open reading frames of 357 bp encoding a putative protein of 118 amino acid residues and 330 bp encoding a putative protein of 109 amino acid residues, respectively. The carboxyl-terminal part of the two crustins possesses, respectively, 7 and 8 conserved cysteine residues representation of a WAP domain that is found in carcinins and crustins in other several crustaceans. The amino acid sequences of Plcrustin1 and Plcrustin2 show that they belong to type I crustins. In order to characterize their properties and biological activities, the two recombinant crustin proteins were produced in the Escherichia coli expression system. Antimicrobial assays showed that the growth of only one Gram-positive bacterium, Micrococcus luteus M1 11, was inhibited by the recombinant Plcrustin1 and Plcrustin2 with MIC of about 0.07-0.27 microM and 3.5-8 microM, respectively. In addition, the study of inhibition mechanism revealed that the antimicrobial activity of the two recombinant crustin proteins was a result of bactericidal effect. However, the two crustins did not exhibit the inhibitory activities against trypsin, chymotrypsin, elastase and subtilisin A.
TI  - Essential oil from the underground parts of Laserpitium zernyi: potential source  of alpha-bisabolol and its antimicrobial activity.
AB  - The composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oil from the underground parts (roots and rhizomes) of Laserpitium zernyi Hayek (Apiaceae) were investigated. The pale blue essential oil, obtained by hydrodistillation, was analyzed by GC and GC-MS. Forty-three compounds were identified (94.3% of total oil). The main constituent, beside alpha-pinene (31.6%) was alpha-bisabolol (30.9%), so this oil may be a novel potential natural source of this sesquiterpene alcohol. The antimicrobial activity was tested using the microdilution method against Gram (+) bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Micrococcus luteus, Enterococcus faecalis), Gram (-) bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli), and two strains of yeast (Candida albicans). L. zernyi oil showed significant antibacterial activity against S. epidermidis, S. aureus and M. luteus, but lower activities against the other tested strains.
TI  - Simple purification of human antimicrobial peptide dermcidin (MDCD-1L) by intein-mediated expression in E.coli.
AB  - Among human antimicrobial peptides (hAMPs), DCD-1L has a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity over a wide pH range and in high salt concentrations. It offers a promising alternative to conventional antibiotics. The 458-bp-long dermcidin cDNA was amplified by PCR using a human fetal cDNA library as a template. The 147-bp fragment of the MDCD-1L gene encoding an additional methionine residue was subcloned into the pTYB11 vector. Recombinant MDCD-1L was expressed as an intein fusion protein in E. coli, and then purified by affinity chromatography using chitin beads. A small peptide with a molecular mass of about 5 kDa was detected by tricine gel electrophoresis. The recombinant MDCD-1L peptide was purified from the gel and its amino acid sequence was determined by nanoLC-ESI-MS/MS analysis. The initiating amino acid, methionine, remained attached to the N-terminal region of recombinant MDCD-1L. Purified MDCD-1L showed antimicrobial activity against a Micrococcus luteus test strain.
TI  - Antimicrobial and antileishmanial studies of novel (2E)-3-(2-chloro-6-methyl/methoxyquinolin-3-yl)-1-(aryl)prop-2-en-1-ones.
AB  - Thirty eight heterocyclic chalcones were synthesized by condensing formylquinolines with diverse methyl arylketones. The target compounds were characterized by spectroscopic techniques (NMR, IR, MS) and elemental analysis. The X-ray crystallographic study of (2E)-3-(2-chloro-6-methylquinolin-3-yl)-1-(2,3-dihydro-1,4-benzodioxin-6-yl)prop- 2-en-1-one (1p) was also performed for the structure confirmation. The title compounds were screened for anti-microbial and antileishmanial activities. The compounds 1c-e, 1g, 1j-m, 1p, 1r-s, 2g, 2j-p, and 2r-s were found potentially active antileishmanial agents, while 1f-i, 1l, 1o-p, 2f-i, 2l, and 2o-p showed remarkable antibacterial activity. Only compounds 1g and 2g-h exhibited significant antifungal activity.
TI  - Synthesis, spectroscopic and biological studies on the new symmetric Schiff base  derived from 2,6-diformyl-4-methylphenol with N-aminopyrimidine.
AB  - A phenol based novel Schiff base polydentate symmetric ligand was prepared. The complexes were prepared by reacting ligand and the metal chlorides of Cu (II), Ni(II), Co(II) and Fe(II) in methanol to get a series of mononuclear complexes. The complexes were characterized by elemental analyses, conductivity measurements, magnetic susceptibility data, IR, UV-Vis, NMR and API-ES mass spectral data. The mononuclear structure of the complexes was confirmed on the basis of elemental analyses, magnetic susceptibility and API-ES mass spectral data. The ligand and all the metal complexes were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity against four Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, S. aureus ATCC 25923, Bacillus cereus ATCC 7064 and Micrococcus luteus ATCC 9345), one Gram-negative bacterium (Escherichia coli ATCC 4230), and three yeast (Candida albicans ATCC 14053, Candida krusei ATCC 6258 and Candida parapsilosis ATCC 22019) strains. Therefore, newly synthesized the ligand and two complexes [(Cu(II) and Co(II)] showed good biological activity against all tested bacteria and yeast strains.
TI  - Molecular characterization and expression of a crustin-like gene from Chinese mitten crab, Eriocheir sinensis.
AB  - Crustin is a cysteine-rich antibacterial peptide which widely distributes within  decapod crustaceans. In the present study, the cDNA encoding crustin-like peptide (designated CrusEs) was cloned from Chinese mitten crab Eriocheir sinensis by using rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) approaches and expressed sequence tag analysis. The full-length cDNA of CrusEs was of 796bp, containing a 5' untranslated region (UTR) of 214bp, a 3' UTR of 267bp with a poly(A) tail, and an open reading frame (ORF) of 315bp encoding a polypeptide of 104 amino acids including a putative signal peptide of 21 amino acids. A WAP domain and the consensus framework existing in class I crustins were both identified in CrusEs, suggesting that CrusEs is a new member of type I crustins. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR was employed to examine the expression of CrusEs, and its mRNA transcript was mainly detected in haemocytes and gill. The CrusEs mRNA transcript in haemocytes was down-regulated after the challenge with Gram-positive bacteria Micrococcus luteus, while Gram-negative bacteria Listonella anguillarum did not induce significant variation of CrusEs mRNA. The mature peptide of CrusEs was cloned into pET-21a(+) with a C-terminal hexa-histidine tag fused in-frame, and expressed in Escherichia coli, and the recombinant CrusEs inhibited the growth of Gram-positive bacteria with low MIC. The results indicate that CrusEs is a potent antibacterial protein against Gram-positive bacteria infection, and it may play an important role in innate immune response of E. sinensis.
TI  - Expression of Acc-Royalisin gene from royal jelly of Chinese honeybee in Escherichia coli and its antibacterial activity.
AB  - Royalisin is an antibacterial peptide found in Royal Jelly. Two gene fragments of Chinese honeybee (Apis cerana cerana) head, 280 bp cDNA encoding pre-pro-Acc-royalisin (PPAR) of 95 amino acid residues, and 165 bp cDNA encoding mature Acc-royalisin (MAR) of 51 amino acid residues were cloned into the pGEX-4T-2 vector. They were then transformed individually into Escherichia coli for expression. Two expressed fusion proteins, glutathione S-transferase (GST)-PPAR of 36 kDa and GST-MAR of 32 kDa were obtained, which were cross reacted with GST antibody accounting for up to 16.3% and 15.4% of bacterial protein, respectively. In addition, 41% of GST-PPAR and nearly 100% of GST-MAR were soluble proteins. Both lysates of the two purified fusion proteins displayed antibacterial activities, similar to that of nisin against Gram-positive bacteria strains, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis and Micrococcus luteus. MAR peptide released from the thrombin-cleaved GST-MAR fusion protein has a stronger antibacterial activity than that of GST-MAR fusion protein.
TI  - Violacein-producing Collimonas sp. from the sea surface microlayer of costal waters in Trondelag, Norway.
AB  - A new strain belonging to the genus Collimonas was isolated from the sea surface  microlayer off the coast of Trondelag, Norway. The bacterium, designated Collimonas CT, produced an antibacterial compound active against Micrococcus luteus. Subsequent studies using LC-MS identified this antibacterial compound as violacein, known to be produced by several marine-derived bacteria. Fragments of the violacein biosynthesis genes vioA and vioB were amplified by PCR from the Collimonas CT genome and sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis of these sequences demonstrated close relatedness of the Collimonas CT violacein biosynthetic gene cluster to those in Janthinobacterium lividum and Duganella sp., suggesting relatively recent horizontal gene transfer. Considering diverse biological activities of violacein, Collimonas CT shall be further studied as a potential producer of this compound.
TI  - Discorhabdins from the Korean marine sponge Sceptrella sp.
AB  - Two new pyrroloiminoquinone alkaloids of the discorhabdin class, along with 12 compounds including one previously described synthetic derivative of the same and related skeletal classes, were isolated from the sponge Sceptrella sp., collected from Gageodo, Korea. The structures of these new compounds, designated as (-)-3-dihydrodiscorhabdin D (11) and (-)-discorhabdin Z (12), were determined by combined spectroscopic analyses. Compound 12 possesses an unusual hemiaminal group among the discorhabdin alkaloids. These compounds exhibited moderate to significant cytotoxicity, antibacterial activity, and inhibitory activity against sortase A.
TI  - AiCTL-6, a novel C-type lectin from bay scallop Argopecten irradians with a long  C-type lectin-like domain.
AB  - C-type lectins are a superfamily of carbohydrate-recognition proteins which play  crucial roles in the innate immunity. In this study, a novel C-type lectin gene from scallop Argopecten irradians (designated as AiCTL-6) was cloned by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) approach based on expression sequence tag (EST) analysis. The full-length cDNA of AiCTL-6 was 1080 bp. The open reading frame encoded a polypeptide of 307 amino acids, including a signal sequence and a C-type lectin-like domain (CTLD) of 150 amino acid residues longer than any usual CTLD. It contained six conserved cysteine residues involved in the formation of three internal disulfide bridges and an EPD (Glu(269)-Pro(270)-Asp(271)) motif at the Ca(2+)-binding site 2. The deduced amino acid sequence of AiCTL-6 showed high similarity to members of C-type lectin superfamily. By fluorescent quantitative real-time PCR, AiCTL-6 mRNA was found mainly in hepatopancreas and gill, and marginally expressed in other tissues. After the scallops were challenged by Listonella anguillarum for 6 h, the mRNA expression of AiCTL-6 was up-regulated significantly to 7.2-fold compared to the blank group. While at 9 h post Micrococcus luteus challenge, its expression level was 60.1 times higher than that of the blank group. The functional activity of AiCTL-6 was investigated by recombination and expression of the cDNA fragment encoding its mature peptide in Escherichia coli Rosetta gami (DE3). The recombinant AiCTL-6 could agglutinate Gram-negative bacteria E. coli TOP10F', Gram-positive bacteria M. luteus and Staphylococcus aureus. These results collectively suggested that AiCTL-6, as a novel member of C-type lectin family, contributed to the host defense mechanisms against invading microorganism in A. irradians.
TI  - Genes involved in long-chain alkene biosynthesis in Micrococcus luteus.
AB  - Aliphatic hydrocarbons are highly appealing targets for advanced cellulosic biofuels, as they are already predominant components of petroleum-based gasoline and diesel fuels. We have studied alkene biosynthesis in Micrococcus luteus ATCC 4698, a close relative of Sarcina lutea (now Kocuria rhizophila), which 4 decades ago was reported to biosynthesize iso- and anteiso-branched, long-chain alkenes. The underlying biochemistry and genetics of alkene biosynthesis were not elucidated in those studies. We show here that heterologous expression of a three-gene cluster from M. luteus (Mlut_13230-13250) in a fatty acid-overproducing Escherichia coli strain resulted in production of long-chain alkenes, predominantly 27:3 and 29:3 (no. carbon atoms: no. C=C bonds). Heterologous expression of Mlut_13230 (oleA) alone produced no long-chain alkenes but unsaturated aliphatic monoketones, predominantly 27:2, and in vitro studies with the purified Mlut_13230 protein and tetradecanoyl-coenzyme A (CoA) produced the same C(27) monoketone. Gas chromatography-time of flight mass spectrometry confirmed the elemental composition of all detected long-chain alkenes and monoketones (putative intermediates of alkene biosynthesis). Negative controls demonstrated that the M. luteus genes were responsible for production of these metabolites. Studies with wild-type M. luteus showed that the transcript copy number of Mlut_13230-13250 and the concentrations of 29:1 alkene isomers (the dominant alkenes produced by this strain) generally corresponded with bacterial population over time. We propose a metabolic pathway for alkene biosynthesis starting with acyl-CoA (or-ACP [acyl carrier protein]) thioesters and involving decarboxylative Claisen condensation as a key step, which we believe is catalyzed by OleA. Such activity is consistent with our data and with the homology (including the conserved Cys-His-Asn catalytic triad) of Mlut_13230 (OleA) to FabH (beta-ketoacyl-ACP synthase III), which catalyzes decarboxylative Claisen condensation during fatty acid biosynthesis.
TI  - Functional analysis of a putative holin-like peptide-coding gene in the genome of Bacillus licheniformis AnBa9.
AB  - BhlA, a putative holin-like protein of Bacillus licheniformis AnBa9 expressed in  Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) showed antibacterial activity against several gram-positive bacteria including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Micrococcus luteus. Deletion analysis of bhlA suggests that a hydrophobic transmembrane domain, BhlATM is essential for antibacterial activity. Though the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of BhlA was sevenfold lower than BhlATM, transmembrane domain deleted construct (BhlATM) had no antibacterial activity. The expression of BhlA in E. coli was found to be toxic to cells. Therefore, the bhlA was cloned in yeast surface display vector pYD1 and expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The surface displayed yeast showed inhibition of several gram-positive bacteria. This recombinant yeast expressing BhlA may be used as biodrug for efficient control of multiple drug-resistant bacterial infections.
TI  - Differential transcriptomic responses of Biomphalaria glabrata (Gastropoda, Mollusca) to bacteria and metazoan parasites, Schistosoma mansoni and Echinostoma paraensei (Digenea, Platyhelminthes).
AB  - A 70-mer-oligonucleotide-based microarray (1152 features) that emphasizes stress  and immune responses factors was constructed to study transcriptomic responses of the snail Biomphalaria glabrata to different immune challenges. In addition to sequences with relevant putative ID and Gene Ontology (GO) annotation, the array features non-immune factors and unknown B. glabrata ESTs for functional gene discovery. The transcription profiles of B. glabrata (3 biological replicates, each a pool of 5 snails) were recorded at 12h post-wounding, exposure to Gram negative or Gram positive bacteria (Escherichia coli and Micrococcus luteus, respectively), or infection with compatible trematode parasites (Schistosoma mansoni or Echinostoma paraensei, 20 miracidia/snail), relative to controls, using universal reference RNA. The data were subjected to Significance Analysis for Microarrays (SAM), with a false positive rate (FPR) <or=10%. Wounding yielded a modest differential expression profile (27 up/21 down) with affected features mostly dissimilar from other treatments. Partially overlapping, yet distinct expression profiles were recorded from snails challenged with E. coli (83 up/20 down) or M. luteus (120 up/42 down), mostly showing up-regulation of defense and stress-related features. Significantly altered expression of selected immune features indicates that B. glabrata detects and responds differently to compatible trematodes. Echinostoma paraensei infection was associated mostly with down-regulation of many (immune-) transcripts (42 up/68 down), whereas S. mansoni exposure yielded a preponderance of up-regulated features (140 up/23 down), with only few known immune genes affected. These observations may reflect the divergent strategies developed by trematodes during their evolution as specialized pathogens of snails to negate host defense responses. Clearly, the immune defenses of B. glabrata distinguish and respond differently to various immune challenges.
TI  - Characterization of expression, activity and role in antibacterial immunity of Anopheles gambiae lysozyme c-1.
AB  - There are eight lysozyme genes in the Anopheles gambiae genome. Transcripts of one of these genes, LYSC-1, increased in Anopheles gambiae cell line 4a3B by 24 h after exposure to heat-killed Micrococcus luteus. Lysozyme activity was also identified in conditioned media from the cell line from which the protein was purified to homogeneity using ion exchange and gel filtration. Mass spectrometric analysis of the purified protein showed 100% identity to lysozyme c-1. Purified lysozyme c-1 was tested against non-mosquito-derived as well as culturable bacteria isolated from mosquito midguts. Lysozyme c-1 had negligible effects on the growth of most mosquito-derived bacteria in vitro but did inhibit the growth of M. luteus. Although Lys c-1 did not directly kill most bacteria, knockdown of LYSC-1 resulted in significant mortality in mosquitoes subjected to hemocoelic infections with Escherichia coli but not M. luteus thus suggesting that this protein plays an important role in antibacterial defense against selected bacteria.
TI  - Expression and purification of an antimicrobial peptide by fusion with elastin-like polypeptides in Escherichia coli.
AB  - Different carrier molecules have been fused to antimicrobial polypeptides (AMPs)  to facilitate recombinant protein expression and purification. Some of them have improved the stability of AMPs and reduced the toxicity to host cells, but most current strategies still have some problems to be solved such as poor yield, low purity, high expense, time-consumption, and difficulty in scaling-up. Here, we introduced the elastin-like polypeptides (ELPs) as a fusion partner to express an antimicrobial polypeptide halocidin18 (Hal18). By the reversible soluble-insoluble phase transition, 69 mg of the fusion protein were purified from 1 l of culture medium with the purity of nearly 95%. After cleavage with hydroxylamine, the ELP's tag was easily separated from Hal18 in the next round of inverse transition cycle and Hal18 (1.7 mg, approximately 1.9 kDa) was mainly found in the supernatant with a recovery of about 47% and purity of 60%. Antimicrobial activity showed that Hal18 had strong antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli and Micrococcus luteus but weak activity against Pichia pastoris.
TI  - Hydroxytyrosol from tyrosol using hydroxyphenylacetic acid-induced bacterial cultures and evidence of the role of 4-HPA 3-hydroxylase.
AB  - Hydroxytyrosol (HTyr) is a potent natural antioxidant found in olive mill wastewaters. Bacterial conversion of 4-tyrosol (2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-ethanol) to HTyr was reported in a limited number of bacterial species including Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In this work, we studied this conversion, taking as a model the newly isolated Halomonas sp. strain HTB24. It was first hypothesized that the enzyme responsible for 4-tyrosol hydroxylation in HTyr was a 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid 3-hydroxylase (HPAH, EC 1.14.13.3), previously known to convert 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (4-HPA) into 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (3,4-DHPA) in P. aeruginosa. Cloning and expression of hpaB (oxygenase component) and hpaC (reductase component) genes from P. aeruginosa confirmed this hypothesis. Furthermore, using cultures of HTB24 containing 4-tyrosol, it was shown that 4-HPA accumulation preceded 4-tyrosol hydroxylation. We further demonstrated that the synthesis of HPAH activity was induced by 4-HPA, with the latter compound being formed from 4-tyrosol oxidation by aryl-dehydrogenases. Interestingly, similar results were obtained with other 4-HPA-induced bacteria, including P. aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus and other Halomonas, thus demonstrating general hydroxylating activity of 4-tyrosol by the HPAH enzyme. E. coli W did not have aryl-dehydrogenase activity and hence were unable to oxidize 4-tyrosol to 4-HPA and HTyr to 3,4-DHPA, making this bacterium a good candidate for achieving better HTyr production.
TI  - Lysozymes and lysozyme-like proteins from the fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda.
AB  - Lysozyme is an important component of the insect non-specific immune response against bacteria that is characterized by its ability to break down bacterial cell-walls. By searching an EST database from the fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda (Negre et al., 2006), we identified five sequences encoding proteins of the lysozyme family. The deduced protein sequences corresponded to three classical c-type lysozymes Sf-Lys1, Sf-Lys2 and Sf-Lys3, and two lysozyme-like proteins, Sf-LLP1 and Sf-LLP2. Sf-Lys1 was purified from the hemolymph of Escherichia coli-challenged S. frugiperda larvae. The mature protein had a molecular mass of 13.975 Da with an isoelectric point of 8.77 and showed 98.3% and 96.7% identity with lysozymes from Spodoptera litura and Spodoptera exigua, respectively. As the other insect lysozymes, Sf-Lys1 was active against gram positive bacteria such as Micrococcus luteus but also induced a slight permeabilization of the inner membrane of E. coli. Genes encoding these five Sf-Lys or Sf-LLPs were differentially up-regulated in three immune-competent tissues (hemocytes, fat body and gut) after challenges with non-pathogenic bacteria, E. coli and M. luteus, or entomopathogenic bacterium, Photorhabdus luminescens. Sf-Lys1 and Sf-Lys2 were mainly induced in fat body in the presence of E. coli or P. luminescens. Sf-Lys3, which had an acidic isoelectric point, was found to be the most up-regulated of all five Sf-Lys or Sf-LLPs in hemocytes and gut after challenge with P. luminescens. More molecular data are now available to investigate differences in physiological functions of these different members of the lysozyme superfamily.
TI  - Static magnetic field exposure fails to affect the viability of different bacteria strains.
AB  - The viability of the microbes Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Bacillus circulans, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Salmonella enteritidis, Serratia marcescens, and Staphylococcus aureus was tested under static magnetic field exposure up to 24 h in either a homogeneous (159.2 +/- 13.4 mT) or three types of inhomogeneous static magnetic fields: (i) peak-to-peak magnetic flux density 476.7 +/- 0.1 mT with a lateral magnetic flux density gradient of 47.7 T/m, (ii) 12.0 +/- 0.1 mT with 1.2 T/m, or (iii) 2.8 +/- 0.1 mT with 0.3 T/m. Even the longest period of exposure failed to produce any effect in the growth of bacteriae that could be correlated with static magnetic field exposure.
TI  - Nitric oxide is an essential component of the hemocyte-mediated mosquito immune response against bacteria.
AB  - Nitric oxide is a signaling and immune effector molecule synthesized by the enzyme nitric oxide synthase. In mosquitoes, nitric oxide functions as a parasite antagonist in the midgut but little is known about its function in the hemocoel. Here, we characterized the temporal and spatial expression of the Anopheles gambiae nitric oxide synthase gene and explored the role nitric oxide plays in the antibacterial response in the mosquito hemocoel. Quantitative PCR and Western blot analyses showed that nitric oxide synthase is expressed in hemocytes and fat body, and is upregulated in response to systemic infection with Escherichia coli and Micrococcus luteus. Diaphorase staining and immunofluorescence showed that nitric oxide synthase is abundant in the granulocyte subpopulation of hemocytes, and both the staining intensity and the percentage of cells that stain for nitric oxide synthase significantly increase after a bacterial challenge. When nitric oxide production was inhibited, the mosquito's ability to kill E. coli was significantly reduced. Accordingly, inhibiting nitric oxide production increased the mortality rate of mosquitoes with systemic E. coli infections. Taken altogether, these data show that nitric oxide is a crucial player in the antibacterial immune response in the mosquito hemocoel.
TI  - Chemical composition, antifungal and antibacterial activity of the essential oil  of Chamaecyparis nootkatensis from Spain.
AB  - The chemical composition of the oil of Chamaecyparis nootkatensis (D. Don) Spach. has been analysed by gas chromatography (GC) and gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS). A total of 34 compounds were identified representing more than 90% of the total oil. The oil was richer in monoterpenes than in sesquiterpenes, the major constituents being limonene (53.2%), 6-3-carene (21.0%) and a-pinene (12.2%). The antibacterial and antifungal activities of the oil were also tested against Candida albicans, Bacillus subtilis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella sp. and Serratia marcescens. Only two of these, Bacillus subtilis and Candida albicans, were sensitive to the treatment, inhibition zones of 11 and 14 mm diameter being obtained, respectively. As far as we know, this is the first report of the antifungal and antibacterial activity of this species.
TI  - Anti-listerial activity and structure-activity relationships of the six major tyrocidines, cyclic decapeptides from Bacillus aneurinolyticus.
AB  - Six major tyrocidines, purified from the antibiotic tyrothricin complex produced  by Bacillus aneurinolyticus, showed significant lytic and growth inhibitory activity towards the gram+ bacteria, Micrococcus luteus and Listeria monocytogenes, but not against the gram- bacterium, Escherichia coli. The isolated natural tyrocidines were in particular more active against the leucocin A (antimicrobial peptide) resistant strain, L. monocytogenes B73-MR1, than the sensitive L. monocytogenes B73 strain. Remarkably similar structure-activity trends toward the three gram+ bacteria were found between growth inhibition and different physicochemical parameters (solution amphipathicity, theoretical lipophilicity, side-chain surface area and mass-over-charge ratio).
TI  - Effects of stingless bee and honey bee propolis on four species of bacteria.
AB  - We examined the antibacterial activities of several types of propolis, including  Africanized honey bee green propolis and propolis produced by meliponini bees. The antibacterial activity of green propolis against Micrococcus luteus and Staphylococcus aureus was superior to that of Melipona quadrifasciata and Scaptotrigona sp propolis. Only two samples of propolis (green propolis and Scaptotrigona sp propolis) were efficient against Escherichia coli. Melipona quadrifasciata propolis was better than green propolis and Scaptotrigona sp propolis against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We concluded that these resins have potential for human and veterinary medicine.
TI  - Integrative gene cloning and expression system for Streptomyces sp. US 24 and Streptomyces sp. TN 58 bioactive molecule producing strains.
AB  - Streptomyces sp. US 24 and Streptomyces sp. TN 58, two strains producing interesting bioactive molecules, were successfully transformed using E. coli ET12567 (pUZ8002), as a conjugal donor, carrying the integrative plasmid pSET152. For the Streptomyces sp. US 24 strain, two copies of this plasmid were tandemly integrated in the chromosome, whereas for Streptomyces sp. TN 58, the integration was in single copy at the attB site. Plasmid pSET152 was inherited every time for all analysed Streptomyces sp. US 24 and Streptomyces sp. TN 58 exconjugants under nonselective conditions. The growth, morphological differentiation, and active molecules production of all studied pSET152 integrated exconjugants were identical to those of wild type strains. Consequently, conjugal transfer using pSET152 integration system is a suitable means of genes transfer and expression for both studied strains. To validate the above gene transfer system, the glucose isomerase gene (xylA) from Streptomyces sp. SK was expressed in strain Streptomyces sp. TN 58. Obtained results indicated that heterologous glucose isomerase could be expressed and folded effectively. Glucose isomerase activity of the constructed TN 58 recombinant strain is of about eighteenfold higher than that of the Streptomyces sp. SK strain. Such results are certainly of importance due to the potential use of improved strains in biotechnological process for the production of high-fructose syrup from starch.
TI  - Antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of the edible medicinal halophyte Tamarix gallica L. and related polyphenolic constituents.
AB  - Tamarix gallica is a halophytic species having hepatotonic and stimulant properties, as it was traditionally used in the treatment of various liver disorders. Leaf and flower infusion have anti-inflammatory and anti-diarrheic properties. In this work, we have investigated antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of leaf and flower extracts and their phenolic composition. Results showed that flowers exhibit a higher antioxidant activity as compared to the leaves, IC(50) values of the flower extracts are being 1.3 (beta-carotene bleaching) to 19 times (lipid peroxidation inhibition) lower than those for leaves. Accordingly, flower extracts exhibited the highest total phenolic content (135.35 mgGAE/gDW) and RP-HPLC analysis showed that syringic acid, isoquercitin as well as catechin were the major phenolics. Furthermore, Tamarix extracts showed appreciable antibacterial properties against human pathogen strains. The mean inhibition zone was from 0 to 6.5mm when the concentration increased from 2 to 100mg/l. The strongest activity was recorded against Micrococcus luteus and the lowest activity was observed against Escherichia coli. Moreover, organ extracts show a weakly to moderate activity against the tested Candida. These findings suggest that Tamarix may be considered as an interesting source of antioxidants for therapeutic or nutraceutical industries and for food manufactures.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of six pomegranate (Punica granatum L.) varieties and their relation to some of their pomological and phytonutrient characteristics.
AB  - Arils from six pomegranate (Punica granatum L.) varieties grown in the Mediterranean region of Turkey were tested for their antimicrobial properties by the agar diffusion and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) methods against seven bacteria: (Bacillus megaterium DSM 32, Pseudomonas aeruginosa DSM 9027, Staphylococcus aureus Cowan 1, Corynebacterium xerosis UC 9165, Escherichia coli DM, Enterococcus faecalis A10, Micrococcus luteus LA 2971), and threefungi (Kluvyeromyces marxianus A230, Rhodotorula rubra MC12, Candida albicans ATCC 1023). It has been observed that the pomegranate aril extracts had antimicrobial effect on all microorganisms, giving inhibition zones ranging in size from 13 to 26 mm. The MIC values for active pomegranate extracts ranged between 30 and >90 microg/mL. The results obtained appeared to confirm the antimicrobial potential of the Punica granatum varieties.
TI  - Two thymosin-repeated molecules with structural and functional diversity coexist  in Chinese mitten crab Eriocheir sinensis.
AB  - Recently, beta-thymosin-like proteins with multiple thymosin domains (defined as  thymosin-repeated proteins) have been identified from invertebrate. In the present study, the cDNAs of two thymosin-repeated proteins (designated EsTRP1 and EsTRP2) were cloned from Chinese mitten crab by expressed sequence tags (EST) techniques. BLAST analysis presented three and two thymosin domains in EsTRP1 and EsTRP2, respectively, with the identities amongst the five domains varying from 47% to 100%. Both EsTRP1 and EsTRP2 shared high similarities with previously identified vertebrate beta-thymosins and invertebrate thymosin-repeated proteins (TRPs) with the identities ranging from 43% to 78%, indicating that EsTRPs were new members of the beta-thymosin family. Real-time RT-PCR assay was adopted to determine the tissue distribution of EsTRPs and their temporal expression profile in hemocytes after pathogen stimulation and injury challenge. The expression of EsTRP1 transcript was predominantly detectable in the tissues of hemocytes, hepatopancreas and gonad with the highest expression in hemocytes, while the highest expression level of EsTRP2 was found in heart. EsTRP1 mRNA expression in hemocytes significantly increased at 3 and 48h after Listonella anguillarum challenge, but there was no significant variation in EsTRP2 temporal expression profile. The injury challenge reduced the mRNA expression of EsTRPs, with the down-regulation of EsTRP2 expression occurred earlier than that of EsTRP1. The cDNA fragments encoding their mature peptides of EsTRP1 and EsTRP2 were recombined and expressed in Escherichia coli. The activities of recombinant proteins (rEsTRP1 and rEsTRP2) were examined by MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazoliumbromide) and lysoplate assay. rEsTRP2 could significantly accelerate the growth of human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line, but there was no significant effect of rEsTRP1 on the tumor cell proliferation. Both rEsTRP1 and rEsTRP2 did not possess the ability of killing Micrococcus luteus and L. anguillarum. The differences in the tissue distribution of mRNA transcripts, the response to pathogen stimulation and injury challenge, and the effect of recombinant proteins on human cell proliferation, indicated that there were functional diversity between the two structurally different molecules, EsTRP1 and EsTRP2.
TI  - Linear alkylbenzene sulfonate tolerance in bacteria isolated from sediment of tropical water bodies polluted with detergents.
AB  - The discharge of untreated detergent-bearing waste introduces linear alklcylbenzene sulfonates (LAS) to the aquatic environment. The surfactant persists in some streams and rivers in Nigeria, some is adsorbed to suspended materials and end in the sediment of the receiving water bodies. In this study, bacteria isolated from sediments of some tropical detergent-effluent-polluted streams were tested for tolerance to LAS using the media dilution technique. LAS-tolerance was indicated by growth of the bacteria in the presence of the surfactant. The pH, concentrations of surfactant, population of heterotrophic bacteria and population of LAS-tolerant bacteria in the sediments were determined. A direct relationship (r = 0.9124) was found between the alkaline conditions (pH= 8.2-12.0) and high surfactant concentrations (45-132 mg/g) in the sediment. The sediments harboured a high population and a wide variety of bacteria; the populations of viable heterotrophic bacteria (VHB: 2.9 x 10(5) to 1.2 x 10(7) cfu/g) and LAS tolerant bacteria (LTB: 1.5 x 10(4) to 1.2 x 10(6) cfu/g) had a direct relationship (r = 0.9500). An inverse relationship resulted between each of them and the concentration of surfactant in the sediment, r(VHB/LAS) = -0.9303 and r(LTB/LAS) = -0.9143, respectively. Twelve bacteria species were isolated from the sediment: Alcaligenes odorans, Bacillus subtilis, Burkholderia cepacia, Citrobacter freundii, Citrobacter diversus, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, Micrococcus albus, Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas stutzeri, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcusfaecalis. Most of them were adapted to the surfactant with their maximum acceptable concentrations ranging between 0.03 and >1.0% (w/v). The sediments could serve as source of adapted organisms which can be used in bio-treatment of LAS-bearing waste.
TI  - The antibacterial and antifungal activity of a soda-lime glass containing silver  nanoparticles.
AB  - The antibacterial and antifungal activity of a low melting point soda-lime glass  powder containing silver nanoparticles has been studied. Nano-Ag sepiolite fibres containing monodispersed silver nanoparticles (d(50) approximately 11 +/- 9 nm) were used as the source of silver. This powder presents a high antibacterial (against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria) as well as antifungal (against I. orientalis) activity. The observed high activity against yeast has been explained by considering the inhibitory effect of the Ca(2+) lixiviated from the glass on the growth of the yeast colonies.
TI  - Chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oil from Chaerophyllum aureum L. (Apiaceae).
AB  - The essential oils of the aerial parts and fruits of Chaerophyllum aureum L., collected from two mountains in Serbia, were analyzed by GC and GC/MS. Sabinene (18.5-31.6%), p-cymene (7.9-25.4%) and limonene (1.9-10.9%) were characterized as the main constituents. The oils were tested against six bacterial strains and one strain of yeast, Candida albicans. The highest antimicrobial activity was observed against the Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis and Micrococcus luteus, while of the Gram-negative strains, Escherichia coli was the most sensitive.
TI  - Discovery of Anas platyrhynchos avian beta-defensin 2 (Apl_AvBD2) with antibacterial and chemotactic functions.
AB  - The cationic, cysteine-rich peptides called beta-defensins play a major role in the innate immune response. Here, we describe the identification and characterization of the duck beta-defensin-2 homologue, Anas platyrhynchos avian beta-defensin 2 (Apl_AvBD2). The 195 base pair open reading frame (ORF) of Apl_AvBD2 has 83% identity with Gga_AvBD2 (chicken) and 85% identity with Mga_AvBD2 (turkey) at nucleotide level. The gene corresponding to the coding region is comprised of three exons and two introns in both Apl_AvBD2 and Gga_AvBD2. The predicted secondary structure of Apl_AvBD2 has the classical "beta-defensin core motif" formed by the beta-sheet rich structure. Apart from mild expression in tissues like kidney, lung, brain, bursa of Fabricious and ovary, Apl_AvBD2 mRNA show a very high level constitutive expression in bone marrow and spleen, indicating that it is a myeloid defensin. Purified recombinant Apl_AvBD2 demonstrated in vitro antibacterial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, with a minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of 3.7 microM against Micrococcus luteus NCIM 2871 and Escherichia coli NCIM 2685, and of 2.2 microM against Reimerella anatipestifer. The immunomodulatory potential of Apl_AvBD2 was shown by chemotaxis of DT-40 chicken B-lymphocytes. The widespread tissue distribution and the potent bactericidal and chemotactic activity make Apl_AvBD2 an important molecule in the innate immune response in ducks. It may play a vital role in the immune response of these birds against bacterial and viral pathogens.
TI  - Antibacterial activities of Dodonaea viscosa using contact bioautography technique.
AB  - The crude ethanolic extract and n-hexane, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, n-butanol and aqueous fractions of Dodonaea viscosa were analyzed for antibacterial potential against four Gram positive bacteria: Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, and three Gram negative bacteria: Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Preliminary screening showed inhibition against Staphylococcus aureus, Micrococcus luteus, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The thin layer chromatograms of the fractions were then subjected to contact bioautography, which showed inhibition zone at different R(f) values against Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, indicating the presence of antibacterial components. The MIC of each fraction was determined through a 96-well micro-titer plate method. The non-viability of the organisms was ascertained by determining the MBC of the fractions.
TI  - Leptoglycin: a new Glycine/Leucine-rich antimicrobial peptide isolated from the skin secretion of the South American frog Leptodactylus pentadactylus (Leptodactylidae).
AB  - Antimicrobial peptides are components of innate immunity that is the first-line defense against invading pathogens for a wide range of organisms. Here, we describe the isolation, biological characterization and amino acid sequencing of a novel neutral Glycine/Leucine-rich antimicrobial peptide from skin secretion of Leptodactylus pentadactylus named leptoglycin. The amino acid sequence of the peptide purified by RP-HPLC (C(18) column) was deduced by mass spectrometric de novo sequencing and confirmed by Edman degradation: GLLGGLLGPLLGGGGGGGGGLL. Leptoglycin was able to inhibit the growth of Gram-negative bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Citrobacter freundii with minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 8 microM, 50 microM, and 75 microM respectively, but it did not show antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Micrococcus luteus and Enterococcus faecalis), yeasts (Candida albicans and Candida tropicalis) and dermatophytes fungi (Microsporum canis and Trichophyton rubrum). No hemolytic activity was observed at the 2-200 microM range concentration. The amino acid sequence of leptoglycin with high level of glycine (59.1%) and leucine (36.4%) containing an unusual central proline suggests the existence of a new class of Gly/Leu-rich antimicrobial peptides. Taken together, these results suggest that this natural antimicrobial peptide could be a tool to develop new antibiotics.
TI  - Nagelamides Q and R, novel dimeric bromopyrrole alkaloids from sponges Agelas sp.
AB  - Two new dimeric bromopyrrole alkaloids, nagelamides Q (1) and R (2), have been isolated from Okinawan marine sponges of the genus Agelas (SS-1134 and SS-956, respectively), and the structures and stereochemistry were elucidated from spectroscopic data. Nagelamide Q (1) is a rare dimeric bromopyrrole alkaloid possessing a pyrrolidine ring, while nagelamide R (2) is the first bromopyrrole alkaloid having an oxazoline ring. Nagelamides Q (1) and R (2) showed antimicrobial activity.
TI  - Antibacterial effect of apatite-coated titanium dioxide for textiles applications.
AB  - An antibacterial activity of apatite-coated titanium dioxide (TiO2) against four  types of bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and Micrococcus luteus) was investigated. Its antibacterial performance was observed under black light, visible light, and dark conditions. The number of viable bacteria decreased with irradiation time and became most prominent at 24 hours. Distortion of bacterial cells by the nanoparticles was demonstrated by scanning electron microscopy. Apatite-coated TiO2 was fixed on cotton textiles by dip-coat technique, and the antimicrobial properties of corresponding fabrics were then investigated. The effect of irradiation source on antimicrobial activity of coated cotton fabrics was examined, wherein black-light irradiation demonstrated higher antibacterial activity than either visible-light irradiation or dark conditions. Microbial populations of coated cotton fabrics decreased with increasing irradiation intensity. Coated cotton fabrics have been shown to be nontoxic to human dermal fibroblasts. Our findings suggest that the presence of apatite-coated TiO2 shows antibacterial activity in the presence of black light or visible light, suggesting its potential use in reducing the risk of microorganism transmission for textile applications.
TI  - Binding and Cellular Activation Studies Reveal That Toll-like Receptor 2 Can Differentially Recognize Peptidoglycan from Gram-positive and Gram-negative Bacteria.
AB  - Although much progress has been made toward the identification of innate immune receptors, far less is known about how these receptors recognize specific microbial products. Such studies have been hampered by the need to purify compounds from microbial sources and a reliance on biological assays rather than direct binding to monitor recognition. We have employed surface plasmon resonance (SPR) binding studies using a wide range of well defined synthetic muropeptides derived from Gram-positive (lysine-containing) and Gram-negative (diaminopimelic acid (DAP)-containing) bacteria to demonstrate that Toll-like receptor 2 can recognize peptidoglycan (PGN). In the case of lysine-containing muropeptides, a limited number of compounds, which were derived from PGN remodeled by bacterial autolysins, was recognized. However, a wider range of DAP-containing muropeptides was bound with high affinity, and these compounds were derived from nascent and remodeled PGN. The difference in recognition of the two classes of muropeptides is proposed to be a strategy by the host to respond appropriately to Gram-negative and -positive bacteria, which produce vastly different quantities of PGN. It was also found that certain modifications of the carboxylic acids of isoglutamine and DAP can dramatically reduce binding, and thus, bacterial strains may employ such modifications to evade innate immune detection. Cellular activation studies employing highly purified PGN from Bacillus licheniformis, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus plantarum, Micrococcus luteus, and Staphylococcus aureus support the structure binding relationship. The data firmly establish Toll-like receptor 2 as an innate immune sensor for PGN and provides an understanding of host-pathogen interactions at the molecular level.
TI  - [Expression in E.coli and bioactivity assay of Micrococcus luteus resuscitation promoting factor domain and its mutants].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To express Micrococcus luteus resuscitation promoting factor (Rpf) domain and its mutants in prokaryotic cells, and to investigate their bioactivity. METHODS: The gene of Rpf domain and its mutants (E54K, E54A) were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from the genome of Micrococcus luteus and cloned into pMD18-T vector. After sequenced, the Rpf domain and its mutant gene were subcloned into expression vector PGEX-4T-1, and transfected into E. coli DH5alpha. The expressed product was purified by affinity chromatography using GST Fusion Protein Purification bead. The aim proteins were identified by SDS-PAGE analysis and by Western blot with monoclonal antibodies against Rpf domain (mAb). The bioactivity of the proteins was analyzed by stimulating the resuscitation of Mycobacterium smegmatis. RESULTS: The sequences of the PCR products were identical to those of the Rpf domain and its mutant gene in GenBank. The relative molecular mass identified by SDS-PAGE analysis was consistent with that had been reported, which was also confirmed by Western blot analysis that there were specific bindings at 32 000 with Rpf domain mAb. The purified GST-Rpf domain could stimulate resuscitation of Mycobacterium smegmatis. Replacements E54A and especially E54K resulted in inhibition of Rpf resuscitation activity. CONCLUSIONS: Rpf domain and two kinds of its mutant protein were obtained, and its effects on the resuscitation of dormant Mycobacterium smegmatis were clarified.
TI  - Antimicrobial and antifungal activities of the extracts and essential oils of Bidens tripartita.
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the antibacterial and antifungal properties of the extracts, subextracts and essential oils of Bidens tripartita flowers and herbs. In the study, twelve extracts and two essential oils were investigated for activity against different Gram-positive Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli, E. coli (beta-laktamase+), Klebsiella pneumoniae (ESBL+), Pseudomonas aeruginosa and some fungal organisms Candida albicans, C. parapsilosis, Aspergillus fumigatus, A. terreus using a broth microdilution and disc diffusion methods. The results obtained indicate antimicrobial activity of the tested extracts (except butanolic extracts), which however did not inhibit the growth of fungi used in this study. Bacteriostatic effect of both essential oils is insignificant, but they have strong antifungal activity. These results support the use of B. tripartita to treat a microbial infections and it is indicated as an antimicrobial and antifungal agent, which may act as pharmaceuticals and preservatives.
TI  - Molecular characterisation of a goose-type lysozyme gene in Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua L.).
AB  - Lysozymes are antibacterial enzymes important in the innate immune defense of several animal phyla. An Atlantic cod goose-type (g-type) lysozyme EST was identified in a suppression subtractive hybridisation (SSH) cDNA library and the full-length cDNA (codg1) was obtained by RACE-PCR. The lysozyme gene is organised in five exons and four introns similar to g-type lysozyme genes in other fish species. Two different cod lysozyme transcripts, named codg1 and codg2, seem to be produced by the use of alternative transcription start sites (TSS) in the lysozyme gene. The alternative TSS cause a different exon I usage where exon Ia transcripts possess a putative signal peptide (codg1) while exon Ib transcripts (codg2) lack this feature. Lysozyme without the signal peptide was produced recombinantly in Escherichia coli and displayed muramidase activity against Micrococcus luteus cells at an unusually low pH. Gene expression analysis of codg1 and codg2 showed that both were expressed in several tissues with highest expression in the head kidney, peritoneum and spleen. Codg1 and codg2 were differentially expressed in some tissues. In the non-immunised control group, codg2 was expressed significantly higher in the head kidney compared to codg1, while an opposite expression profile was observed in the gills. Compared to non-immunised fish, a significant up-regulation of codg2 transcripts was observed in the peritoneum and gills after injection of formalin inactivated Listonella anguillarum indicating a role for g-type lysozyme in the innate defense system of cod.
TI  - A fibrinogen-related protein from bay scallop Argopecten irradians involved in innate immunity as pattern recognition receptor.
AB  - The family of fibrinogen-related proteins (FREPs) is a group of proteins with fibrinogen-like domains. Many members of this family play important roles as pattern recognition receptors in innate immune responses. The cDNA of bay scallop Argopecten irradians FREP (designated as AiFREP) was cloned by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) method based on the expressed sequence tag (EST). The full-length cDNA of AiFREP was of 990bp. The open reading frame encoded a polypeptide of 251 amino acids, including a signal sequence and a 213 amino acids fibrinogen-like domain. The fibrinogen-like domain of AiFREP was highly similar to those of mammalian ficolins and other FREPs. The temporal expression of AiFREP mRNA in hemolymph was examined by fluorescent quantitative real-time PCR. The mRNA level of scallops challenged by Listonella anguillarum was significantly up-regulated, peaked to 9.39-fold at 9h after stimulation, then dropped back to 4.37-fold at 12h, while there was no significant change in the Micrococcus luteus challenged group in all periods of treatment. The function of AiFREP was investigated by recombination and expression of the cDNA fragment encoding its mature peptide in Escherichia coli Rosetta gami (DE3). The recombinant AiFREP (rAiFREP) agglutinated chicken erythrocytes and human A, B, O-type erythrocytes. The agglutinating activities were calcium-dependent and could be inhibited by acetyl group-containing carbohydrates. rAiFREP also agglutinated Gram-negative bacteria E. coli JM109, L. anguillarum and Gram-positive bacteria M. luteus in the presence of calcium ions. These results collectively suggested that AiFREP functions as a pattern recognition receptor in the immune response of bay scallop and contributed to nonself recognition in invertebrates, which would also provide clues for elucidating the evolution of the lectin pathway of the complement system.
TI  - Aedes FADD: a novel death domain-containing protein required for antibacterial immunity in the yellow fever mosquito, Aedes aegypti.
AB  - Microbial infections in insects activate a series of immune responses that culminate in the production of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). In Drosophila, two signaling pathways, govern the challenge-dependent expression of AMPs; the Toll and IMD pathways. While AMPs have been the subject of much research in mosquitoes, the regulation of the pathways required for AMP expression remains largely unknown. We report here the identification of Aedes FADD (AeFADD), a death domain protein in Aedes aegypti. AeFadd is expressed in all immune-competent tissues and all developmental stages examined. At the transcriptional level, AeFadd transcripts increased when challenged with Escherichia coli but not Micrococcus luteus. In both cases, we observed the induction of two AMP genes; cecropin and defensin. Loss of AeFadd function by dsRNA interference impaired the inducible expression of both AMPs, and rendered adult mosquitoes susceptible to both types of bacteria. Identifying molecules that regulate mosquito immunity may help elucidate the factors that contribute to the vectorial capacity and provide insights into general mechanisms that regulate innate immunity.
TI  - Possible involvement of an extracellular superoxide dismutase (SodA) as a radical scavenger in poly(cis-1,4-isoprene) degradation.
AB  - Gordonia westfalica Kb1 and Gordonia polyisoprenivorans VH2 induce the formation  of an extracellular superoxide dismutase (SOD) during poly(cis-1,4-isoprene) degradation. To investigate the function of this enzyme in G. polyisoprenivorans VH2, the sodA gene was disrupted. The mutants exhibited reduced growth in liquid mineral salt media containing poly(cis-1,4-isoprene) as the sole carbon and energy source, and no SOD activity was detectable in the supernatants of the cultures. Growth experiments revealed that SodA activity is required for optimal growth on poly(cis-1,4-isoprene), whereas this enzyme has no effect on aerobic growth in the presence of water-soluble substrates like succinate, acetate, and propionate. This was detected by activity staining, and proof of expression was by antibody detection of SOD. When SodA from G. westfalica Kb1 was heterologously expressed in the sodA sodB double mutant Escherichia coli QC779, the recombinant mutant exhibited increased resistance to paraquat, thereby indicating the functionality of the G. westfalica Kb1 SodA and indirectly protection of G. westfalica cells by SodA from oxidative damage. Both sodA from G. polyisoprenivorans VH2 and sodA from G. westfalica Kb1 coded for polypeptides comprising 209 amino acids and having approximately 90% and 70% identical amino acids, respectively, to the SodA from Mycobacterium smegmatis strain MC(2) 155 and Micrococcus luteus NCTC 2665. As revealed by activity staining experiments with the wild type and the disruption mutant of G. polyisoprenivorans, this bacterium harbors only one active SOD belonging to the manganese family. The N-terminal sequences of the extracellular SodA proteins of both Gordonia species showed no evidence of leader peptides for the mature proteins, like the intracellular SodA protein of G. polyisoprenivorans VH2, which was purified under native conditions from the cells. In G. westfalica Kb1 and G. polyisoprenivorans VH2, SodA probably provides protection against reactive oxygen intermediates which occur during degradation of poly(cis-1,4-isoprene).
TI  - Dual Activity of a Viral Lysozyme with High Efficiency for Growth Inhibition of Erwinia amylovora.
AB  - ABSTRACT The lysozyme from Erwinia amylovora phage PhiEa1h was investigated for its ability to inhibit growth of bacteria and compared with the lysozyme from Escherichia coli phage T4. The assays to measure lysozyme activity included cell lysis and growth inhibition of bacteria. Bacterial strains with kanamycin resistance were not affected by lysates containing the PhiEa1h-enzyme. The titer of Micrococcus luteus but not of Erwinia amylovora was diminished by cell extracts containing T4 lysozyme. In contrast, PhiEa1h lysozyme preferentially inhibited E. amylovora, exceeding the T4 lysozyme activity at least one million-fold. Spherical cells were formed after application to E. amylovora similar to lyz-gene expression in Escherichia coli. Heating of cell extracts destroyed the murami-dase activity, but retained an antibacterial activity. Other plant-associated bacteria related to Erwinia amylovora also were inhibited for growth when cell extracts with PhiEa1h lysozyme were applied to soak pear slices and potato slices. Ooze formation and soft rot caused by E. amylovora or E. carotovora subsp. atroseptica, respectively, were strongly reduced and the PhiEa1h lysozyme was more efficient compared with extracts containing T4 lysozyme.
TI  - Spring constants and adhesive properties of native bacterial biofilm cells measured by atomic force microscopy.
AB  - Bacterial biofilms were imaged by atomic force microscopy (AFM), and their elasticity and adhesion to the AFM tip were determined from a series of tip extension and retraction cycles. Though the five bacterial strains studied included both Gram-negative and -positive bacteria and both environmental and laboratory strains, all formed simple biofilms on glass surfaces. Cellular spring constants, determined from the extension portion of the force cycle, varied between 0.16+/-0.01 and 0.41+/-0.01 N/m, where larger spring constants were measured for Gram-positive cells than for Gram-negative cells. The nonlinear regime in the extension curve depended upon the biomolecules on the cell surface: the extension curves for the smooth Gram-negative bacterial strains with the longest lipopolysaccharides on their surface had a larger nonlinear region than the rough bacterial strain with shorter lipopolysaccharides on the surface. Adhesive forces between the retracting silicon nitride tip and the cells varied between cell types in terms of the force components, the distance components, and the number of adhesion events. The Gram-negative cells' adhesion to the tip showed the longest distance components, sometimes more than 1 microm, whereas the shortest distance adhesion events were measured between the two Gram-positive cell types and the tip. Fixation of free-swimming planktonic cells by NHS and EDC perturbed both the elasticity and the adhesive properties of the cells. Here we consider the biochemical meaning of the measured physical properties of simple biofilms and implications to the colonization of surfaces in the first stages of biofilm formation.
TI  - Growth, encystment and survival of Acanthamoeba castellanii grazing on different  bacteria.
AB  - Free-living amoebae of the genus Acanthamoeba are widely distributed in soil and  water collections, where trophozoites (vegetative, multiplicative stages) feed mainly by phagocytosis and thus control bacterial populations in the environment. Here, we examined the growth, encystment and survival of Acanthamoeba castellanii receiving different bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus megaterium, Micrococcus luteus, and Staphylococcus aureus) in nonnutrient saline. All bacteria assayed induced a dose-dependent proliferative response, in most cases maximized with a bacterial dose of 1 x 10(9) mL(-1); except for M. luteus, trophozoites grew better with viable than with heat-killed bacteria. In addition, Acanthamoeba growth was improved by adding bacteria on alternate days. Single-dose experiments indicated a temporal association between the growth of trophozoite and bacterial consumption, and higher consumption of M. luteus, E. coli and P. aeruginosa, bacterial species that allowed the highest trophozoite yields. Long-term Acanthamoeba-bacteria incubation revealed that encystment was significantly delayed by almost all the bacteria assayed (including S. aureus, which elicited a poor growth response) and that the presence of bacteria markedly increased cyst yield; final cyst recovery clearly depended on both the dose and the type of the bacterium given, being much higher with E. coli, M. luteus and P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Wound healing, anti-microbial and antioxidant potential of Dendrophthoe falcata (L.f) Ettingsh.
AB  - Dendrophthoe falcata (L.f) Ettingsh (Loranthaceae) of the order Santalales, is used ethnomedicinally for treating ulcers, asthma, impotence, paralysis, skin diseases, and wounds. In this context, validations of the ethnotherapeutic claims of the plant in wound healing activity was studied, besides anti-microbial activity and antioxidant activity were performed to understand the mechanism of wound healing potency. The ethanolic extract of aerial parts of Dendrophthoe falcata ethanolic extract (DFEE) was investigated for the evaluation of its healing efficiency on excision and incision wound models in rats. The results showed that Dendrophthoe falcata extract has potent wound healing capacity as evident from the wound contraction and increased tensile strength. Hydroxyproline and hexosamine expressions were also well correlative with the healing pattern observed. Three of the fractions A-C (petroleum ether, chloroform and ethanol, respectively) obtained from the extract exhibited significant antimicrobial activity against the organisms: Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Pseudomonas aeroginosa, Serratia marcescens, and five fungi Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis: dimorphic fungi, Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus niger: systemic fungi, and some infectious bacteria Escherichia coli, and Salmonella typhi. The results also indicated that DFEE possesses potent antioxidant activity by inhibiting lipid peroxidation, reduced glutathione, superoxide dismutase levels and increased the catalase activity.
TI  - Synthesis, characterization and antimicrobial activity of Co(II), Zn(II) and Cd(II) complexes with N-benzyloxycarbonyl-S-phenylalanine.
AB  - In this paper the first complexes of M(2+) ions (M(2+) = Zn(2+), Cd(2+) and Co(2+)) with N-benzyloxycarbonyl-S-phenylalaninato ligand (1-3) are described. The new complexes were characterized by means of elemental analysis, IR and UV-vis spectroscopy, molar conductivity measurements and (1)H, (13)C and (15)N NMR spectroscopy (1D and 2D). The Co(II) complex adopts an octahedral geometry, and the Zn(II) and Cd(II) complexes adopt a tetrahedral one. For the first time, the antimicrobial activity of N-benzyloxycarbonyl-S-phenylalaninato ligand (N-Boc-S-phe) and the complexes 1-3 was investigated against gram-positive: Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis and Bacillus subtilis and gram-negative bacteria: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and two strains of the yeast Candida albicans. It was shown that the complexes were effective against most strains. The best activity was detected against the yeast C. albicans.
TI  - Brassica juncea chitinase BjCHI1 inhibits growth of fungal phytopathogens and agglutinates Gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Brassica juncea BjCHI1 is a plant chitinase with two chitin-binding domains. Its  expression, induced in response to wounding, methyl jasmonate treatment, Aspergillus niger infection, and caterpillar Pieris rapae feeding, suggests that it plays a role in defence. In this study, to investigate the potential of using BjCHI1 in agriculture, Pichia-expressed BjCHI1 and its deletion derivatives that lack one or both chitin-binding domains were tested against phytopathogenic fungi and bacteria. Transplastomic tobacco expressing BjCHI1 was also generated and its extracts assessed. In radial growth-inhibition assays, BjCHI1 and its derivative with one chitin-binding domain showed anti-fungal activities against phytopathogens, Colletotrichum truncatum, C. acutatum, Botrytis cinerea, and Ascochyta rabiei. BjCHI1 also inhibited spore germination of C. truncatum. Furthermore, BjCHI1, but not its derivatives lacking one or both domains, inhibited the growth of Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Ralstonia solanacearum, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) more effectively than Gram-positive bacteria (Micrococcus luteus and Bacillus megaterium), indicating that the duplicated chitin-binding domain, uncommon in chitinases, is essential for bacterial agglutination. Galactose, glucose, and lactose relieved agglutination, suggesting that BjCHI1 interacts with the carbohydrate components of the Gram-negative bacterial cell wall. Retention of chitinase and bacterial agglutination activities in transplastomic tobacco extracts implicates that BjCHI1 is potentially useful against both fungal and bacterial phytopathogens in agriculture.
TI  - Mitracarpus frigidus aerial parts exhibited potent antimicrobial, antileishmanial, and antioxidant effects.
AB  - The crude extract and the hexane, CH(2)Cl(2), EtOAc, n-BuOH, and hydromethanolic  fractions of the aerial parts of Mitracarpus frigidus were evaluated against promastigote forms of two species of Leishmania (L. chagasi and L. amazonensis), 11 strains of bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enterica sorovar Tythimurium, Shigella sonnei, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterobacter cloacae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Bacillus cereus) and two yeasts (Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans). The antioxidant activity (DPPH radical scavenging activity and reducing power), cytotoxicity against mammalian cells, and the contents of phenolics and flavonoids were determined. Phytochemical analysis of the major groups of phytoconstituents is also reported. All samples showed antioxidant activity which was positively correlated to the content of phenolic compounds. S. sonnei, B. cereus and C. neoformans were susceptible to all extracts tested, except for the n-BuOH and hydromethanolic fractions, which demonstrated no antimicrobial activity. The lowest MIC was recorded for the CH(2)Cl(2) fraction against C. neoformans (MIC of 10 microg/ml), followed by B. cereus, S. sonnei, and E. cloacae (MIC of 20, 39 and 39 microg/ml, respectively). The CH(2)Cl(2) fraction was the most effective against L. chagasi (IC(50) of 6.7 microg/ml), and the hydromethanolic fraction exhibited the best activity against L. amazonensis (IC(50) of 9 microg/ml). A cytotoxic effect on mammalian cells was observed only for the crude extract and CH(2)Cl(2) fraction at the concentrations of 130 and 31 microg/ml, respectively. These results suggest that M. frigidus has interesting antimicrobial, antileishmanial and antioxidant activities.
TI  - Antimicrobial anthraquinones from Morinda angustifolia.
AB  - Investigation on Morinda angustifolia resulted in the isolation of a new anthraquinone, 1,8-dihydroxy-2-methyl-3,7-dimethoxyanthraquinone (1), along with five known analogues, lucidin 3-O-beta-primeveroside (2), 1,3-dihydroxy-2-methylanthraquinone (3), lucidin- omega -ethyl ether (4), lucidin-omega-butyl ether (5) and damnacanthol (6). The new compound demonstrated significant antimicrobial activity against Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, Sarcina lutea, Candida albicans and Saccharomyces sake.
TI  - Ceragenins: cholic acid-based mimics of antimicrobial peptides.
AB  - The prevalence of drug-resistant bacteria drives the quest for new antimicrobials, including those that are not expected to readily engender resistance. One option is to mimic Nature's most ubiquitous means of controlling bacterial growth, antimicrobial peptides, which have evolved over eons. In general, bacteria remain susceptible to these peptides. Human antimicrobial peptides play a central role in innate immunity, and deficiencies in these peptides have been tied to increased rates of infection. However, clinical use of antimicrobial peptides is hampered by issues of cost and stability. The development of nonpeptide mimics of antimicrobial peptides may provide the best of both worlds: a means of using the same mechanism chosen by Nature to control bacterial growth without the problems associated with peptide therapeutics. The ceragenins were developed to mimic the cationic, facially amphiphilic structures of most antimicrobial peptides. These compounds reproduce the required morphology using a bile-acid scaffolding and appended amine groups. The resulting compounds are actively bactericidal against both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms, including drug-resistant bacteria. This antimicrobial activity originates from selective association of the ceragenins with negatively charged bacterial membrane components. Association has been studied with synthetic models of bacterial membrane components, with bacterial lipopolysaccharide, with vesicles derived from bacterial phospholipids, and with whole cells. Comparisons of the antimicrobial activities of ceragenins and representative antimicrobial peptides suggest that these classes of compounds share a mechanism of action. Rapid membrane depolarization is caused by both classes as well as blebbing of bacterial membranes. Bacteria express the same genes in response to both classes of compounds. On the basis of the antibacterial activities of ceragenins and preliminary in vivo studies, we expect these compounds to find use in augmenting or replacing antimicrobial peptides in treating human disease.
TI  - Synthesis and anti-microbial screening of some Schiff bases of 3-amino-6,8-dibromo-2-phenylquinazolin-4(3H)-ones.
AB  - In the present study, a series of novel Schiff bases were synthesized by condensation of 3-amino-6,8-dibromo-2-phenylquinazolin-4(3H)-ones with different aromatic aldehydes via cyclized intermediate 6,8-dibromo-2-phenyl benzoxazin-4-one. The chemical structures were confirmed by means of IR, (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR, Mass spectral and Elemental analysis. These compounds were screened for anti-bacterial (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC-9144, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC-155, Micrococcus luteus ATCC-4698, Bacillus cereus ATCC-11778, Escherichia coli ATCC-25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC-2853, and Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC-11298) and anti-fungal (Aspergillus niger ATCC-9029 and Aspergillus fumigatus ATCC-46645) activities by paper disc diffusion technique. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the compounds were also determined by agar streak dilution method. Among the synthesized compounds 3-(3,4,5-trimethoxybenzylideneamino)-6,8-dibromo-2-phenylquinazolin-4(3H)-one 10 was found to be the most potent anti-microbial activity with MICs of 18.9, 19.1, 18.8, 21.7, 18.2, 19.3, 16.7, 8.6 and 10.1 microg/ml against above mentioned respective strains. Compounds were found to exhibit more anti-fungal than anti-bacterial activity.
TI  - A novel C1q-domain-containing protein from Zhikong scallop Chlamys farreri with lipopolysaccharide binding activity.
AB  - The C1q-domain-containing (C1qDC) proteins are a family of proteins characterized by a globular C1q (gC1q) domain in their C-terminus. They are involved in various processes of vertebrates and supposed to be an important pattern recognition receptor in innate immunity of invertebrates. In this study, a novel member of C1q-domain-containing protein family was identified from Zhikong scallop Chlamys farreri (designated as CfC1qDC) by expressed sequence tag (EST) and rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) approaches. The full-length cDNA of CfC1qDC was of 777 bp, consisting of a 5'-terminal untranslated region (UTR) of 62 bp and a 3' UTR of 178 bp with a polyadenylation signal sequence AATAAA and a poly (A) tail. The CfC1qDC cDNA encoded a polypeptide of 178 amino acids, including a signal peptide and a C1q-domain of 158 amino acids with the theoretical isoelectric point of 5.19 and the predicted molecular weight of 17.2 kDa. The C1q-domain in CfC1qDC exhibited homology with those in sialic acid binding lectin from mollusks and C1qDC proteins from higher vertebrates. The typical 10 beta-strand jelly-roll folding topology structure of C1q-domain and the residues essential for effective packing of the hydrophobic core were well conserved in CfC1qDC. By fluorescent quantitative real-time PCR, mRNA transcripts of CfC1qDC were mainly detected in kidney, mantle, adductor muscle and gill, and also marginally detectable in hemocytes. In the bacterial challenge experiment, after the scallops were challenged by Listonella anguillarum, there was a significant up-regulation in the relative expression level of CfC1qDC and at 6h post-injection, the mRNA expression reached the maximum level and was 4.55-fold higher than that of control scallops. Similarly, the expression of CfC1qDC mRNA in mixed primary cultures of hemocytes stimulated by lipopolysaccharides (LPS) was up-regulated and reached the maximum level at 6h post-stimulation, and then dropped back to the original level gradually. In order to investigate its function, the cDNA fragment encoding the mature peptide of CfC1qDC was recombined and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). The recombinant CfC1qDC protein displayed a significantly strong activity to bind LPS from E. coli, although no obvious antibacterial or agglutinating activity toward Gram-negative bacteria E. coli JM109, L. anguillarum and Gram-positive bacteria Micrococcus luteus was observed. These results suggested that CfC1qDC was absolutely a novel member of the C1qDC protein family and was involved in the recognition of invading microorganisms probably as a pattern recognition molecule in mollusk.
TI  - Comparative ORESTES-sampling of transcriptomes of immune-challenged Biomphalaria  glabrata snails.
AB  - The snail Biomphalaria glabrata (Gastropoda, Mollusca) is an important intermediate host for the human parasite Schistosoma mansoni (Digenea, Trematoda). Anti-pathogen responses of B. glabrata were studied towards a better understanding of snail immunity and host-parasite compatibility. Open reading frame ESTs (ORESTES) were sampled from different transcriptomes of M line strain B. glabrata, 12h post-challenge with Escherichia coli (Gram-negative), Micrococcus luteus (Gram-positive) bacteria or compatible S. mansoni, and controls. The resulting 3123 ORESTES represented 2129 unique sequences (373 clusters, 1756 singletons). Of these, 175 (8.1%) were putative defense factors, including lectins, antimicrobial peptides and components of various immune-effector systems. Comparison of biological processes (GO-terms) within different transcriptomes indicated that B. glabrata increased oxygen transport and metal binding in reaction to all challenges. Comprehensive comparisons of transcriptomes revealed that responses of B. glabrata against bacteria were similar to each other and differed from the ineffective response to S. mansoni. Furthermore, the response to S. mansoni infection was less comprehensive than that to bacteria. Many novel (unknown) sequences were recovered in association with particular challenges. B. glabrata possesses multi-faceted, potent immune defenses. This agrees with the notion that S. mansoni is capable of immune-evasion and prevents effective host defense responses in order to survive in B. glabrata. Future analysis of the numerous unknown sequences recovered from challenged snails may reveal novel immune factors and provide increased understanding of immunity of B. glabrata in relation to parasite-host compatibility.
TI  - Constituents with independence from growth temperature for bacteria using pyrolysis-gas chromatography/differential mobility spectrometry with analysis of variance and principal component analysis.
AB  - Four bacteria, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus warneri,  and Micrococcus luteus, were grown at temperatures of 23, 30, and 37 degrees C and were characterized by pyrolysis-gas chromatography/differential mobility spectrometry (Py-GC/DMS) providing, with replicates, 120 data sets of retention time, compensation voltage, and ion intensity, each for negative and positive polarity. Principal component analysis (PCA) for 96 of these data sets exhibited clusters by temperature of culture growth and not by genus. Analysis of variance was used to isolate the constituents with dependences on growth temperature. When these were subtracted from the data sets, Fisher ratios with PCA resulted in four clusters according to genus at all temperatures for ions in each polarity. Comparable results were obtained from unsupervised PCA with 24 of the original data sets. The ions with taxonomic features were reconstructed into 3D plots of retention time, compensation voltage, and Fisher ratio and were matched, through GC-mass spectrometry (MS), with chemical standards attributed to the thermal decomposition of proteins and lipid A. Results for negative ions provided simpler data sets than from positive ions, as anticipated from selectivity of gas phase ion-molecule reactions in air at ambient pressure.
TI  - Microbial production of plant benzylisoquinoline alkaloids.
AB  - Benzylisoquinoline alkaloids, such as the analgesic compounds morphine and codeine, and the antibacterial agents berberine, palmatine, and magnoflorine, are synthesized from tyrosine in the Papaveraceae, Berberidaceae, Ranunculaceae, Magnoliaceae, and many other plant families. It is difficult to produce alkaloids on a large scale under the strict control of secondary metabolism in plants, and they are too complex for cost-effective chemical synthesis. By using a system that combines microbial and plant enzymes to produce desired benzylisoquinoline alkaloids, we synthesized (S)-reticuline, the key intermediate in benzylisoquinoline alkaloid biosynthesis, from dopamine by crude enzymes from transgenic Escherichia coli. The final yield of (S)-reticuline was 55 mg/liter within 1 h. Furthermore, we synthesized an aporphine alkaloid, magnoflorine, or a protoberberine alkaloid, scoulerine, from dopamine via reticuline by using different combination cultures of transgenic E. coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells. The final yields of magnoflorine and scoulerine were 7.2 and 8.3 mg/liter culture medium. These results indicate that microbial systems that incorporate plant genes cannot only enable the mass production of scarce benzylisoquinoline alkaloids but may also open up pathways for the production of novel benzylisoquinoline alkaloids.
TI  - [Preparation and characterization of monoclonal antibodies against Micrococcus luteus Rpf domain].
AB  - AIM: To express Micrococcus luteus Rpf domain in prokaryotic cells and prepare monoclonal antibodies against Rpf domain. METHODS: The gene encoding Micrococcus luteus Rpf domain was amplified from genome of Micrococcus luteus by polymerase chain reaction(PCR), and inserted into cloning vector pUC-19. After sequenced, Micrococcus luteus Rpf domain gene was subcloned into the expression vector pPro-EXHT and transfected into E.coli DH5alpha. After induced by IPTG, the bacteria controlled by T7 promoter expressed the fused Micrococcus luteus Rpf domain protein with a hexahistidine tail at its N-terminal and the target protein was purified under denaturing conditions. Using this protein as antigen to immunize the BALB/c mice and prepare monoclonal antibodies against Micrococcus luteus Rpf domain. Then specifities and relative affinities of mAbs were identified by ELISA. RESULTS: The fusion protein was purified by metal chelate affinity chromatography under denaturing condition. Three cloned mAbs were prepared from the mice immunized by Rpf domain. All of them could recognize Rpf domain. specifically. CONCLUSION: The prepared mAbs against Rpf domain have strong specificity with high titers, which provides useful tools for further study of the function of Rpf domain in TB prevention.
TI  - [Study of ectoparasitism of ultramicrobacteria of the genus Kaistia, strains NF1  and NF3 by electron and fluorescence microscopy].
AB  - Transmission electron and fluorescence microscopy was used to study the character of the interaction of free-living ultramicrobacterial (UMB) strains NF1 and NF3, affiliated with the genus Kaistia, and seven species of gram-positive and gram-negative heterotrophic bacteria. Strains NF1 and NF3 were found to exhibit parasitic activity against gram-positive Bacillus subtilis and gram-negative Acidovorax delafildii. UMB cells are tightly attached to the envelopes of the victim cells and induce their lysis, thus demonstrating the features of typical ectoparasitism. The selectivity of parasitism of the studied UMB to the victim bacteria has been shown: only two soil microorganisms of the seven test objects, B. subtilis ATCC 6633 and an aerobic gram-negative bacterium A. delafildii 39, were found to be sensitive to UMB attack. Other bacteria (Micrococcus luteus VKM Ac-2230, Staphylococcus aureus 209-P, Pseudomonas putida BS394, Escherichia coli C 600, and Pantoea agglomerans ATCC 27155) were not attacked by UMB. It was established for the first time that free-living UMB may be facultative parasites not only of phototrophic bacteria, as we have previously demonstrated, but of heterotrophic bacteria as well. The UMB under study seem to play an important role in the regulation of the quantity of microorganisms and in the functioning of microbial communities in some natural ecotopes.
TI  - Bovine hemoglobin: an attractive source of antibacterial peptides.
AB  - A peptic hemoglobin hydrolysate was fractioned by a semi-preparative reversed-phase HPLC and some fractions have an antibacterial activity against four bacteria strains: Micrococcus luteus A270, Listeria innocua, Escherichia coli and Salmonella enteritidis. These fractions were analyzed by ESI/MS and ESI/MS/MS, in order to characterize the peptides in these fractions. Each fraction contains at least three peptides and some fractions contain five peptides. All these fractions were purified several times by HPLC to obtain pure peptides. Thirty antibacterial peptides were identified. From the isolated antibacterial peptides, 24 peptides were derived from the alpha chains of hemoglobin and 6 peptides were derived from the beta chains of hemoglobin. The lowest concentration of these peptides (minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)) necessary to completely inhibit the growth of four bacteria strain was determined. The cell population of all of the tested bacteria species decreased by at least 97% after a 24-h incubation with any of the peptides at the minimum inhibitory concentration.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of dextran-conjugated lysozyme against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus in cheese curd.
AB  - The purposes of this research were to glycosylate lysozyme with dextran under Maillard reaction conditions and assess the antimicrobial characteristics of the lysozyme-dextran conjugate in a culture medium and cheese curd. Solutions containing lysozyme and dextran were incubated at 60 degrees C and at 79% relative humidity. Gel permeation chromatography and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were used to follow the glycosylation process. Under optimum conditions 3.7 mol of dextran were coupled to 1 mol of lysozyme. Lytic activity of the conjugate against the cell wall of Micrococcus luteus was about 62% of that of native lysozyme. Evaluation of the lysozyme-dextran conjugate against test microorganisms (Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli) in culture media indicated a progressive increase in antimicrobial activity, with an increase in enzyme-conjugate concentration. The lysozyme-dextran conjugate was also effective against E. coli in a natural food system, as it reduced the bacterial count by 3 log in cheese curd after 40 days of storage. Unlike E. coli, the antimicrobial action of lysozyme against S. aureus was not improved by conjugation with dextran in both in vitro and in vivo tests. Antimicrobial activity of the lysozyme-dextran conjugate against gram-negative bacteria is probably related to the remaining lytic activity as well as the excellent surfactant properties of the lysozyme-dextran conjugate. These results might increase the applicability of lysozyme as a natural antimicrobial ingredient in different food products.
TI  - Synthesis, structure and biological activities of cobalt(II) and zinc(II) coordination compounds with 2-benzimidazole derivatives.
AB  - In this work we present the synthesis, structural and spectroscopic characterisation of a series of cobalt(II) and zinc(II) coordination compounds with benzimidazole (bz) and its 2-benzimidazole derivatives: 2-aminobenzimidazole (2ab), albendazole (abz) and tris(2-benzimidazolylmethyl)amine (ntb). The compounds were evaluated for their in vitro antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Micrococcus luteus, Salmonella typhi, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Proteus vulgaris. Their cytotoxic activity was also evaluated using human cancer lines, HeLa, HCT-15 and SKLU-1. The halide tetrahedral compounds [Co(bz)2Br2] 3, [Zn(2ab)2Cl2].0.5H2O 11, [Co(abz)Cl2(H2O)].3H2O 14, [Co(abz)Br2(H2O)] 15, [Zn(abz)Cl2(H2O)].3H2O 17 and [Zn(abz)Br2(H2O)].H2O 18 displayed similar minimal inhibition concentration (MIC) values against Micrococcus luteus and Escherichia coli, comparable to those of amoxicillin and chloramphenicol. Additionally, 11 showed a wide range of activity towards Gram(+) and Gram(-) microorganisms. The tetradentate ntb and its trigonal bipyramidal cobalt(II) and zinc(II) compounds were active, regardless of the anion present in the complex. Compound [Co(abz)Cl2(H2O)].3H2O 14 showed promising activity in HeLa cells, while [Co(ntb)Br]Br.H2O 21 inhibited Hela and HCT-15 cell lines.
TI  - NMR based structure-activity relationship analysis of an antimicrobial peptide, thanatin, engineered by site-specific chemical modification: Activity improvement and spectrum alteration.
AB  - Activity improvement of an antimicrobial peptide, thanatin, has been achieved up  to 4-fold higher than natural original one by site-specific chemical modifications with tert-butyl group at two cysteine residues which form an intramoleular disulfide bridge. The chemically modified thanatin (C11tBu/C18tBu) exhibited improved antimicrobial activity toward Gram-positive bacteria, Micrococcus luteus, whereas lowered activity toward Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli. This finding suggests that disulfide-bridge formation is not only indispensable for exhibition of antimicrobial activity of thanatin but also closely related to the activity specificity towards bacteria. NMR analysis indicates that thanatin acts against E.coli stereospecifically by taking advantage of its C-terminal beta-hairpin structure, while the activity against M. luteus does not relate to structures and correlates very well to side-chain hydrophobicity.
TI  - Identification and characterization of two novel lysozymes from Rhodnius prolixus, a vector of Chagas disease.
AB  - Lysozymes have been described in invertebrates as digestive or immune molecules.  We report here the characterization of two novel c-type lysozymes, RpLys-A (EU250274) and RpLys-B (EU250275), isolated from the fat body and digestive tract of immune stimulated Rhodnius prolixus, a major vector of Chagas disease. Transcriptional profiles indicate that the temporal and spatial expression patterns of these two peptides are very different. RpLys-A is expressed predominantly in the midgut after ingestion of Trypanosoma cruzi in a bloodmeal, or after injection of bacteria into the hemocoel. RpLys-B is expressed primarily in the fat body after bacterial injection. Phylogenetic alignments indicate that RpLys-A aligns best with molecules from other hemipterans whose major expression is found in the intestinal tract whereas RpLys-B aligns best with mosquito and tick molecules whose expression is found principally in hemocytes and fat body and whose role has been described as immune-related. These data suggest a differential compartmentalized role of two closely related molecules; one for immunity in the hemocoel and the other for digestion in the midgut.
TI  - Quantitation of bacteria through adsorption of intracellular biomolecules on carbon paste and screen-printed carbon electrodes and voltammetry of redox-active probes.
AB  - A new electrochemical method for the quantitation of bacteria that is rapid, inexpensive, and amenable to miniaturization is reported. Cyclic voltammetry was used to quantitate M. luteus, C. sporogenes, and E. coli JM105 in exponential and stationary phases, following exposure of screen-printed carbon working electrodes (SPCEs) to lysed culture samples. Ferricyanide was used as a probe. The detection limits (3s) were calculated and the dynamic ranges for E. coli (exponential and stationary phases), M. luteus (exponential and stationary phases), and C. sporogenes (exponential phase) lysed by lysozyme were 3 x 10(4) to 5 x 10(6) colony-forming units (CFU) mL(-1), 5 x 10(6) to 2 x 10(8) CFU mL(-1) and 3 x 10(3) to 3 x 10(5) CFU mL(-1), respectively. Good overlap was obtained between the calibration curves when the electrochemical signal was plotted against the dry bacterial weight, or between the protein concentration in the bacterial lysate. In contrast, unlysed bacteria did not change the electrochemical signal of ferricyanide. The results indicate that the reduction of the electrochemical signal in the presence of the lysate is mainly due to the fouling of the electrode by proteins. Similar results were obtained with carbon-paste electrodes although detection limits were better with SPCEs. The method described herein was applied to quantitation of bacteria in a cooling tower water sample.
TI  - Cathepsin L and cystatin B gene expression discriminates immune coelomic cells in the leech Theromyzon tessulatum.
AB  - Previous studies evidenced that cystatin B-like gene is specifically expressed and induced in large circulating coelomic cells following bacterial challenge in the leech Theromyzon tessulatum. In order to understand the role of that cysteine proteinase inhibitor during immune response, we investigated the existence of members of cathepsin family. We cloned a cathepsin L-like gene and studied its tissue distribution. Immunohistochemical studies using anti-cathepsin L and anti-cystatin B antibodies and ultrastructural results demonstrated the presence of three distinct coelomic cell populations: (1) the chloragocytes, which were initially defined as large coelomocytes, (2) the granular amoebocytes and (3) small coelomic cells. Among those cells, while chloragocytes contain cystatin B and cathepsin L, granular amoebocytes contain only cathepsin L and the third cell population contains neither cathepsin nor inhibitor. Finally, results evidenced that cathepsin L immunopositive granular amoebocytes are chemoattracted to the site of injury and phagocyte bacteria.
TI  - Immune system responses and fitness costs associated with consumption of bacteria in larvae of Trichoplusia ni.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Insects helped pioneer, and persist as model organisms for, the study of specific aspects of immunity. Although they lack an adaptive immune system, insects possess an innate immune system that recognizes and destroys intruding microorganisms. Its operation under natural conditions has not been well studied, as most studies have introduced microbes to laboratory-reared insects via artificial mechanical wounding. One of the most common routes of natural exposure and infection, however, is via food; thus, the role of dietary microbial communities in herbivorous insect immune system evolution invites study. Here, we examine the immune system response and consequences of exposing a lepidopteran agricultural pest to non-infectious microorganisms via simple oral consumption. RESULTS: Immune system response was compared between Trichoplusia ni larvae reared on diets with or without non-pathogenic bacteria (Escherichia coli and Micrococcus luteus). Two major immune response-related enzymatic activities responded to diets differently - phenoloxidase activity was inhibited in the bacteria-fed larvae, whereas general antibacterial activity was enhanced. Eight proteins were highly expressed in the hemolymph of the bacteria fed larvae, among them immune response related proteins arylphorin, apolipophorin III and gloverin. Expression response among 25 putative immune response-related genes were assayed via RT-qPCR. Seven showed more than fivefold up regulation in the presence of bacterial diet, with 22 in total being differentially expressed, among them apolipophorin III, cecropin, gallerimycin, gloverin, lysozyme, and phenoloxidase inhibiting enzyme. Finally, potential life-history trade-offs were studied, with pupation time and pupal mass being negatively affected in bacteria fed larvae. CONCLUSION: The presence of bacteria in food, even if non-pathogenic, can trigger an immune response cascade with life history tradeoffs. Trichoplusia ni larvae are able to detect and respond to environmental microbes encountered in the diet, possibly even using midgut epithelial tissue as a sensing organ. Potential benefits of this immune system priming may outweigh the observed tradeoffs, as priming based on environmentally sensed bacterial may decrease risk of serious infection. These results show that food plant microbial communities represent a dynamic and unstudied part of the coevolutionary interactions between plants and their insect herbivores.
TI  - Profiling infection responses in the haemocytes of the mosquito, Aedes aegypti.
AB  - Pathogens that infect and/or are transmitted by mosquitoes typically are exposed  to the body cavity, and to haemocytes circulating therein, during development or dissemination. Aedes aegypti haemocytes produce a range of immune response-related gene products, and an endpoint response of phagocytosis and/or melanization that is temporally and structurally distinct for the invading pathogen. Expressed sequence tags were generated from haemocyte libraries and then used to design oligonucleotide microarrays. Arrays were screened with haemocyte material collected 1-, 8- and 24-h post-inoculation with Escherichia coli or Micrococcus luteus bacteria. Data from these studies support the discovery of novel immune response-activated genes, provide an expanded understanding of antimicrobial peptide biology and highlight the coordination of immune factors that leads to an endpoint response.
TI  - Characterization of Antarctic psychrotrophic bacteria with antibacterial activities against terrestrial microorganisms.
AB  - Five-hundreds and eighty bacterial strains, isolated from various Antarctic marine sources and locations, were screened for antimicrobial activity against terrestrial microorganisms. Twenty-two Antarctic isolates (3.8%), mainly retrieved from the water column at Terra Nova Bay (Ross Sea), expressed antagonistic activity against one to three indicator organisms. Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis resulted as the more susceptible, followed by Micrococcus luteus and Bacillus subtilis. None of the isolates inhibited the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella enterica and the eukaryotic fungus Candida albicans. Active Antarctic isolates, identified by 16S rDNA sequencing and phenotypically characterized by classical methods, were phylogenetically affiliated to the Actinobacteria (16 strains) and the gamma-Proteobacteria (6 strains). Inhibition patterns, as well as phenotypic characteristics, highly vary for different isolates, even though they were affiliated to the same genus or closely related to the identical microorganism retrieved from the database, suggesting that these features were more likely strain-rather than species-specific.Results obtained from the present study confirm previous observations and highlight the potentiality of Antarctic marine bacteria as novel source of antibacterial substances.
TI  - Bioprospecting highly diverse endophytic Pestalotiopsis spp. with antibacterial properties from Maytenus ilicifolia, a medicinal plant from Brazil.
AB  - Thirteen endophytic fungal strains of the genus Pestalotiopsis were isolated from the medicinal plant Maytenus ilicifolia Mart. ex. Reiss (commonly known as "espinheira santa") and their antimicrobial properties were investigated. Two isolates were successful in inhibiting the growth of the tested microorganisms (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)) using the technique of bioautographic thin-layer chromatography (TLC) agar overlay assay. An analysis based on a polyphasic approach integrating taxonomic information, morphological traits, RAPD markers, and the sequencing of the ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 of the rDNA led to the assignment of the isolates as belonging to the species Pestalotiopsis microspora, Pestalotiopsis vismiae, and Pestalotiopsis leucothoes. Therefore, the present study presents a new approach to the study of endophytic fungi of the genus Pestalotiopsis.
TI  - 13,15-N-cycloimide derivatives of chlorin p6 with isonicotinyl substituent are photosensitizers targeted to lysosomes.
AB  - Four monocationic cycloimide derivatives of chlorin p(6) (CICD) were studied as photosensitizers and compared to a structurally similar neutral derivative. Cationic CICD are highly photostable (quantum yield of photobleaching is about 1 x 10(-5), generate singlet oxygen under irradiation (quantum yields are 0.3-0.45), can be involved in a photo-induced substrate-dependent generation of superoxide radicals, but do not produce OH . 17,18-delta-lacton 13(2)-(N-methylisonicotinylamido)-13,15-cycloimide mesochlorin p(6) () and 13(2)-(N-methylisonicotinylamido)-13,15-cycloimide mesochlorin p(6) methyl ester () possess high cancer cell killing photodynamic activity, but they provide no photoinduced bactericidal effect. Substitution of an ethyl group with a hydroxyethyl or acetyl group at position 3 of the macrocycle results in a decrease in extinction and intracellular accumulation that finally leads to the reduced photocytotoxicity. Cationic CICD are targeted to lysosomes, and their intracellular penetration occurs most probably via caveolae-dependent endocytosis. Photodynamic treatment with cationic CICD results in the cell death via necrosis at both sub-phototoxic (40-70% of dead cells) and phototoxic (90-100% of dead cells) regimes of cell treatment. Irradiation induces lysosome damage, leakage of CICD from lysosomes and development of protease activity in cytoplasm, whereas mitochondria are not affected with irradiation. A positive charge of cationic CICD modified drastically an internalization pathway, sites of intracellular localization and mechanisms of photoinduced cytotoxicity as compared to previously studied neutral and anionic CICD. Our experiments with different CICD show that varying charge and structure of substituents it is possible to modulate many cellular properties of CICD in order to find the best molecular template of the advanced near-IR photosensitizer for photodynamic therapy.
TI  - Verification of elicitor efficacy of lipopolysaccharides and peptidoglycans on antibacterial peptide gene expression in Bombyx mori.
AB  - We verified the efficacy of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in activating the cecropin B gene (CecB) in an immune-competent Bombyx mori cell line. Strong activation of CecB by the LPSs from Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella minnesota were completely eliminated after digestion of the LPSs with muramidase. The results clearly indicate that a polymer form of PGN in the LPSs elicited CecB. An oligonucleotide microarray screen revealed that none of the 16,000 genes on the array were activated by LPS in the cells. In contrast, E. coli PGN strongly elicited five antibacterial peptide genes and numerous other genes, and PGN from Micrococcus luteus activated only several genes. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR revealed that all antibacterial genes activated by both PGNs, but the extents were 10-100 times higher with E. coli PGN. Similarly, higher elicitor activity of E. coli than M. luteus was indicated using peptidoglycan recognition protein gene, which is involved in pro-phenol oxidase cascade.
TI  - Broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity of the reactive compounds generated in vitro by Manduca sexta phenoloxidase.
AB  - Although quinone production and melanin formation are widely recognized as an integral part of the insect defense system, experimental evidence is lacking that the proteolytic activation of prophenoloxidase participates in the direct killing of invading microbes-active phenoloxidase generates quinones that polymerize to form melanin. Here, we report the antimicrobial effect of reactive intermediates produced in phenoloxidase-catalyzed reactions. After being treated with Manduca sexta phenoloxidase and dopamine, Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis ceased to grow, whereas the growth of Pichia pastoris was slightly affected. Microscopic analysis showed melanin deposition on cell surface, aggregation of bacteria, and loss of cell mobility. Viability tests revealed major decreases in the bacterial colony counts and, since the decrease remained significant after dispersion of the cell clumps, the reactive compounds were surmised to have aggregated and killed E. coli and B. subtilis cells. Under the experimental conditions, 60-94% of the Gram-negative bacteria (E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella typhimurium) and 52-99% of the Gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus cereus, B. subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, and Staphylococcus aureus) were killed. In the presence of phenoloxidase, dopamine or 5,6-dihydroxyindole (DHI) exhibited much higher antibacterial activity than L-dopa, N-acetyldopamine (NADA) or N-beta-alanyldopamine (NBAD) did, suggesting that DHI and its oxidation products were cytotoxic. The antifungal activity of DHI was detected using P. pastoris, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Candida albicans, and Beauveria bassiana. These results established that prophenoloxidase activation is an integral component of the insect defense system involving a multitude of enzymes (e.g. proteinases, oxidases, and dopachrome conversion enzyme (DCE)), which immobilizes and kills invading microorganisms.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity in the common seawhip, Leptogorgia virgulata (Cnidaria: Gorgonaceae).
AB  - Antimicrobial activity was examined in the gorgonian Leptogorgia virgulata (common seawhip) from South Carolina waters. Extraction and assay protocols were developed to identify antimicrobial activity in crude extracts of L. virgulata. Detection was determined by liquid growth inhibition assays using Escherichia coli BL21, Vibrio harveyii, Micrococcus luteus, and a Bacillus sp. isolate. This represents the first report of antimicrobial activity in L. virgulata, a temperate/sub-tropical coral of the western Atlantic Ocean. Results from growth inhibition assays guided a fractionation scheme to identify active compounds. Reverse-phase HPLC, HPLC-mass spectrometry, and 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy were used to isolate, purify, and characterize metabolites in antimicrobial fractions of L. virgulata. Corroborative HPLC-MS/NMR evidence validated the presence of homarine and a homarine analog, well-known emetic metabolites previously isolated from L. virgulata, in coral extracts. In subsequent assays, partially-purified L. virgulata fractions collected from HPLC-MS fractionation were shown to contain antimicrobial activity using M. luteus and V. harveyii. This study provides evidence that homarine is an active constituent of the innate immune system in L. virgulata. We speculate it may act synergistically with cofactors and/or congeners in this octocoral to mount a response to microbial invasion and disease.
TI  - A combined mass spectrometric and cDNA sequencing approach to the isolation and characterization of novel antimicrobial peptides from the skin secretions of Phyllomedusa hypochondrialis azurea.
AB  - Studies conducted on amphibian skin secretions over the past 40 years have isolated and identified huge arrays of bioactive peptides, many of which have demonstrated potent anti-microbial activity. Such peptides are attracting increasing attention due to the growing problem of pathogenic microorganisms resistant to conventional antibiotics. The current study utilized a combined proteomic/genomic approach to facilitate the high throughput sequencing of five novel dermaseptins and four novel phylloseptins from the skin secretions of Phyllomedusa hypochondrialis azurea. Peptides were partially identified using Q-TOF MS/MS fragmentation and de novo sequencing, while a cDNA library was constructed from the lyophilized skin secretion. 3'-RACE reactions used primers designed for the highly conserved 5'-signal regions of previously deduced dermaseptin precursors. cDNA sequenced peptides were attributed to their respective fragmentation spectra to confirm the structure of the final processed peptides. Such an approach identified post-translational modifications in addition to deciphering isobaric amino acids. Several of the peptides were purified to homogeneity and displayed potent antimicrobial activity with minimum inhibitory concentrations starting at 0.4 microM when tested against and range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria including Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Micrococcus luteus.
TI  - Immune upregulation of novel antibacterial proteins from silkmoths (Lepidoptera)  that resemble lysozymes but lack muramidase activity.
AB  - Study on immune proteins in domesticated and wild silkmoths Bombyx mori and Antheraea mylitta, respectively, led to identification of a new class of antimicrobial proteins. We designated them as lysozyme-like proteins (LLPs) owing to their partial similarity with lysozymes. However, lack of characteristic catalytic amino acid residues essential for muramidase activity in LLPs puts them functionally apart from classical lysozymes. Two LLPs, one from B. mori (BLLP1) and the other from A. mylitta (ALLP1) expressed in a recombinant system, exhibited a broad-spectrum antibacterial action. Further investigation of the antibacterial mechanism revealed that BLLP1 is bacteriostatic rather than bactericidal against Escherichia coli and Micrococcus luteus. Substantial increase in hemolymph bacterial load was observed in B. mori upon RNA interference mediated in vivo knockdown of BLLP1. We demonstrate that the antibacterial mechanism of this protein depends on peptidoglycan binding unlike peptidoglycan hydrolysis or membrane permeabilization as observed with lysozymes and most other antimicrobial peptides. To our knowledge, this is the first report on functional analysis of novel, non-catalytic lysozyme-like family of antibacterial proteins that are quite apart functionally from classical lysozymes. The present analysis holds promise for functional annotation of similar proteins from other organisms.
TI  - Comparison of the antibacterial activity of honey from different provenance against bacteria usually isolated from skin wounds.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of honey samples provided by apiarists and honey packers was tested against microorganisms usually isolated from skin wounds. The antibacterial activity was tested using the well-agar diffusion assay. The honey samples were tested without dilution, and at 75, 50, 30, and 10% (w/v) dilution. Most of the undiluted honey samples inhibited the growth of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Some honey samples provided by apiarists also inhibited the growth of S. aureus even at 50% dilution. Undiluted honey samples also inhibited the growth of Staphylococcus uberis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae, although to a lesser extent. No inhibition of Micrococcus luteus and Enterococcus faecalis growth was detected. The diameters of the inhibition zones generated by honey samples provided by apiarists were larger than those generated by honey samples provided by honey packers. This observation may be explained by considering the provenance of the honey samples.
TI  - Protein kinase A activity and protein phosphorylation in the haemocytes of immune-challenged Galleria mellonella larvae.
AB  - Protein kinase A (PKA) activity was detected in the haemocytes of greater wax moth, Galleria mellonella larvae using a specific peptide substrate--kemptide. The enzyme was activated in vitro by 1 microM concentration of cAMP, 8-Br-cAMP, 8-Chl-cAMP and BzcMP, whereas in the case of cGMP 10 microM concentration was necessary. Immune challenge of G. mellonella larvae with bacteria led to changes in haemocyte PKA activity. Gram-positive M. luteus was a better inducer of PKA activity than Gram-negative E. coli. The kinetics of activity changes was dependent on the bacteria used and considerably differed from that observed in water-treated insects. Inhibition of PKA activity by cell-permeable, specific inhibitor, Rp-8-Br-cAMPS, induced changes in haemocyte morphology resembling those caused by live bacteria. Four potential PKA substrates of 155 kDa, 44 kDa, 40 kDa and 22 kDa were recognized in the haemocytes of naive larvae by phospho-motif antibodies for PKA phosphorylation consensus site. The modification level of 40 kDa protein changed after water treatment and immune challenge of G. mellonella larvae, whereas that of 155 kDa protein changed only after E. coli and LPS injections. Additionally, in the haemocytes of bacteria- and LPS-challenged insects a transient phosphorylation of 36 kDa protein was detected.
TI  - New triazole and triazolothiadiazine derivatives as possible antimicrobial agents.
AB  - Triazole and triazoles fused with six-membered ring systems are found to possess  diverse applications in the fields of medicine, agriculture and industry. The new 1,2,4-triazole and 1,2,4-triazolo[3,4-b][1,3,4]thiadiazine derivatives were synthesized as novel antimicrobial agents. The reaction of 1H-indol-3-acetic acid with thiocarbohydrazide gave the 4-amino-3-mercapto-5-[(1H-indol-3-yl)methyl]-4H-1,2,4-triazole. The reaction of triazole with arylaldehydes in ethanol gave the 4-arylideneamino-3-mercapto-5-[(1H-indol-3-yl)methyl]-4H-1,2,4-triazoles (I). The 3-[(1H-indol-3-yl)methyl]-6-aryl-7H-1,2,4-triazolo[3,4-b][1,3,4]thiadiazines (II) were obtained by condensing triazole with phenacyl bromides in absolute ethanol . The chemical structures of the compounds were elucidated by IR, (1)H NMR and FAB(+)-MS spectral data. Their antimicrobial activities against Micrococcus luteus (NRLL B-4375), Bacillus cereus (NRRL B-3711), Proteus vulgaris (NRRL B-123), Salmonella typhimurium (NRRL B-4420), Staphylococcus aureus (NRRL B-767), Escherichia coli (NRRL B-3704), Candida albicans and Candida glabrata (isolates obtained from Osmangazi University, Faculty of Medicine) were investigated and significant activity was obtained.
TI  - Synthesis of isomeric, oxathiolone fused chalcones, and comparison of their activity toward various microorganisms and human cancer cells line.
AB  - Isomeric oxathiolone fused chalcones were prepared by condensation of appropriate acetylbenzo[1,3]oxathiol-2-ones with benzaldehydes under acidic conditions. The synthesized compounds were screened for cytotoxic activity using HeLa cells, as well as for antibacterial activity against Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, antifungal activity against Candida albicans, and tuberculostatic activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H(37)Rv and Mycobacterium kansasii strains.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of endodontic sealers, MTA-based cements and Portland cement.
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of different root-end filling materials - Sealer 26, Sealapex with zinc oxide, zinc oxide and eugenol, white and gray Portland cement, white and gray MTA-Angelus, and gray Pro Root MTA - against six different microorganism strains. The agar diffusion method was used. A base layer was made using Muller-Hinton agar (MH) and wells were formed by removing the agar. The materials were placed in the wells immediately after manipulation. The microorganisms used were: Micrococcus luteus (ATCC9341), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC6538), Escherichia coli (ATCC10538), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC27853), Candida albicans (ATCC 10231), and Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 10541). The plates were kept at room temperature for 2 h for prediffusion and then incubated at 37 degrees C for 24 h. Triphenyltetrazolium chloride 0.05% gel was added for optimization, and the zones of inhibition were measured. Data were subjected to the Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn tests at a 5% significance level. The results showed that all materials had antimicrobial activity against all the tested strains. Analysis of the efficacy of the materials against the microbial strains showed that Sealapex with zinc oxide, zinc oxide and eugenol and Sealer 26 created larger inhibition halos than the MTA-based and Portland cements (P < 0.05). On the basis of the methodology used, it may be concluded that all endodontic sealers, MTA-based and Portland cements evaluated in this study possess antimicrobial activity, particularly the endodontic sealers.
TI  - Rickettsia peacockii, an endosymbiont of Dermacentor andersoni, does not elicit or inhibit humoral immune responses from immunocompetent D. andersoni or Ixodes scapularis cell lines.
AB  - Ixodes scapularis and Dermacentor andersoni cell lines were stimulated with heat-killed Escherichia coli and Micrococcus luteus to investigate whether infection by Rickettsia peacockii, an endosymbiont of D. andersoni, modifies humoral immune responses. Radial diffusion assays, western blotting, flow cytometry, and quantitative reverse-transcription PCR were used to determine if expression of bacteriolytic peptides, including lysozyme and defensin, was upregulated by bacterial stimulation or infection with R. peacockii. The I. scapularis line IDE12 upregulated expression of lysozyme and defensin following stimulation. The D. andersoni cell line DAE15 also expressed defensin and lysozyme, but only lysozyme was upregulated by bacterial stimulation. R. peacockii infection alone, or in cells stimulated with bacteria, did not modify defensin or lysozyme expression in either cell line. These results suggest tick endosymbionts may avoid recognition by the tick immune system, and infection may not affect humoral immune responses to bacteria not normally associated with ticks.
TI  - Ecological variables affecting predatory success in Myxococcus xanthus.
AB  - The feeding efficiency of microbial predators depends on both the availability of various prey species and abiotic variables. Myxococcus xanthus is a bacterial predator that searches for microbial prey by gliding motility, and then kills and lyses its prey with secreted compounds. We manipulated three ecological variables to examine their effects on the predatory performance of M. xanthus to better understand its behavior and how it affects prey populations. Experiments were designed to determine how surface solidity (hard vs soft agar), density of prey patches (1 vs 2 cm grids), and type of prey (Gram-positive Micrococcus luteus vs Gram-negative Escherichia coli) affect predatory swarming and prey killing by M. xanthus. The prey were dispersed in patches on a buffered agar surface. M. xanthus swarms attacked a greater proportion of prey patches when patches were densely arranged on a hard-agar surface, compared with either soft-agar surfaces or low-patch-density arrangements. These ecological variables did not significantly influence the rate of killing of individual prey within a patch, although a few surviving prey were more likely to be recovered on soft agar than on hard agar. These results indicate that M. xanthus quickly kills most nearby E. coli or M. luteus regardless of the surface. However, the ability of M. xanthus to search out patches of these prey is affected by surface hardness, the density of prey patches, and the prey species.
TI  - Microbiologic profile of flexible endoscope disinfection in two Brazilian hospitals.
AB  - BACKGROUND: [corrected] Endoscopes are routinely used in hospitals and clinics of the world and they can be potential sources of cross-infection when the decontamination process is unsuitable AIM: The routines of flexible endoscope (bronchoscopes, esophagogastroduodenoscopes and colonoscopes) disinfection procedures used in two Brazilian university hospitals were evaluated during a 3-year period METHODS: Aleatory samples from internal channels of endoscopes were collected after patient examination and after cleaning/disinfection procedures RESULTS: A contamination >3 log10 was achieved in samples recovered from endoscopes after patient examination. These samples yielded gram-negative bacilli (n = 142: 56%), gram-positive cocci (n = 43: 17%), yeast cells (n = 43: 17%), and gram-positive bacilli (n = 26: 10%). Approximately, 72 out of 149 samples (48.32%) collected after undergoing the cleaning and disinfection procedures disclosed gram-negative bacilli (n = 55: 61%), gram-positive cocci (n = 21: 23%), gram-positive bacilli (n = 8: 9%) and yeast cells (n = 6: 7%). Esophagogastroduodenoscopes and colonoscopes were the most frequently contaminated devices. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter spp, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter freundii, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus coagulase negative, Micrococcus luteus, Candida albicans, C. tropicalis, C. glabrata, C. guilliermondii, Bacillus spp and Corynebacterium spp were predominantly identified CONCLUSION: Inappropriate cleaning and low times of disinfection were respectively the major factors associated with the presence of microorganisms in colonoscopes and esophagogastroduodenoscopes. By analyzing the identified germs, hospital disinfection was considered of either intermediate or poor level. After this investigation, both university centers improved their previous protocols for disinfection and conditions for reprocessing endoscopes.
TI  - A new antibacterial compound produced by an indigenous marine bacteria--fermentation, isolation, and biological activity.
AB  - The use of microorganisms for biological purpose has become an effective alternative to control pathogens. A marine bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated from Eal fish of Baluchistan coast of Pakistan. This strain produced a bactericidal antibiotic against environmental and clinical isolates. In this study, we purified bactericidal antibiotic from the ethyl acetate extract of the cells of P. aeruginosa and analyzed its chemical structure. Based on spectrometric analysis, this compound 1 is proposed to be 1-methyl-1,4 dihydroquinoline and is active against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA), Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Vibrio aliginolyticus, Micrococcus luteus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterobacter faecium but it is not active against G streptococci, Candida albicans, Aspergillus niger. Minimal inhibitory concentration for Gram-positive bacteria was between 50 and 75 microg mL(-1) and for Gram-negative bacteria 75-100 microg mL(-1).
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of different gutta-percha points and calcium hydroxide pastes.
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of different trademarks and compositions of gutta-percha points and calcium hydroxide pastes used in endodontic therapy. The evaluated material consisted of gutta-percha points containing calcium hydroxide (Roeko), gutta-percha points containing chlorhexidine (Roeko), two conventional gutta-percha points (Endo Points and Roeko) and two calcium hydroxide pastes (Calen and Calen/PMCC). Antimicrobial tests included five species of microorganisms: Escherichia coli (ATCC10538), Staphylococcus epidermidis (ATCC12228), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC6538), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC27853), and Micrococcus luteus (ATCC9341). The Agar diffusion method was employed. The plates were kept at room temperature for 2 h for prediffusion and then incubated at 37 degrees C for 24 h. The triphenyltetrazolium chloride gel was added for optimization and the zones of inhibition were measured. Statistical evaluation was carried out using analysis of variance and Tukey Test. The obtained results showed that all microbial species used in the study were inhibited by the gutta-percha points containing chlorhexidine and by the calcium hydroxide pastes (Calen and Calen/PMCC), with similar results (p > 0.05). No antimicrobial activity was observed for the other groups. It was concluded that the gutta-percha points containing chlorhexidine presented antimicrobial activity, whereas the gutta-percha points containing calcium hydroxide did not.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus pumilus during the fermentation of African locust bean (Parkia biglobosa) for Soumbala production.
AB  - AIMS: To examine predominant isolates of Bacillus subtilis and B. pumilus isolated from Soumbala for their antimicrobial activity against indicator microorganisms as Micrococcus luteus, Staphyloccocus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Enterococus facium, Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Shigella dysenteriae, Yersinia enterocolitica, Aspergillus ochraceus and Penicillium roqueforti. METHODS AND RESULTS: Growth inhibition of indicator microorganisms by cells and supernatants of three B. subtilis and two B. pumilus strains was investigated using agar diffusion tests. Inactivation of indicator microorganisms was investigated in laboratory broth and during the fermentation of African locust bean for Soumbala production. The Bacillus isolates showed variable ability of inhibition and inactivation according to the indicator microorganism. The supernatants of pure cultures of B. subtilis inhibited one strain of B. cereus, one of Staph. aureus and E. coli and caused abnormal germination of Aspergillus ochraceus. The supernatant of mixed cultures of B. subtilis and indicators inhibited all the indicators. A treatment with protease eliminated the inhibitions. Isolates of B. subtilis inactivated all the indicators organisms during the fermentation of African locust bean as well as in laboratory broth with about five to eight decimal reduction. CONCLUSION: Bacillus isolates from Soumbala inhibit and inactivate Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria as well as ochratoxin A producing fungi during both laboratory cultivation and natural fermentation. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Selection of starter cultures of Bacillus spp. for controlled production of Soumbala.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity and pollen composition of honey samples collected from different provinces in Turkey.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of honey samples from different sources were collected and investigated against Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 27736, Morganella morganii, Micrococcus luteus NRRL B-4375, Escherichia coli ATCC 35218, and Candida albicans. Pathogens exhibited different sensitivities towards the honey samples. The results showed that majority of the honey samples (75%) generally inhibitied the bacteria tested. The honey samples which were obtained from Izmir (samples 1 and 2) proved more effective as inhibitors against P. aeruginosa, E. coli, and S. aureus. The honey which was obtained from Mugla (sample 5) exhibited high anticandidal activity on C. albicans. A comparison of the honey samples on the basis of pollen content revealed that they were heterofloral, and samples which had highest antibacterial activity against P. aeruginosa, E. coli, and S. aureus were dominated by pollen from Chenopodiaceae/Amaranthaceae (sample 1), and Trifolium, Trigonella, Cyperaceae, Zea mays and Anthemis taxa (sample 2). The honey proved more effective on bacteria than antibiotics.
TI  - Proteolytic activation of pro-spatzle is required for the induced transcription of antimicrobial peptide genes in lepidopteran insects.
AB  - Microbial infection leads to proteolytic activation of Drosophila spatzle, which  binds to the toll receptor and induces the synthesis of immune proteins. To test whether or not this mechanism exists in lepidopteran insects, we cloned the cDNA of Bombyx mori spatzle-1 and overexpressed the full-length and truncated BmSpz1 cDNA in Escherichia coli. The insoluble fusion proteins were affinity-purified under denaturing condition. After the silkworm larvae were injected with renatured BmSpz1, mRNA levels of antimicrobial peptide genes greatly increased. Similar transcriptional up-regulation was also found in Manduca sexta. Injection of pro-BmSpz1 had no such effect. When pro-BmSpz1 and Micrococcus luteus were incubated with the plasma from M. sexta larvae, we detected proteolytic processing of pro-BmSpz1. These results suggest that active spatzle is required for the induced production of antimicrobial peptides in B. mori and M. sexta.
TI  - Analytical detection and biological assay of antileukemic drug 5-fluorouracil using gold nanoparticles as probe.
AB  - Gold nanoparticles are reported and evaluated as probes for the detection of anticancer drug 5-fluorouracil (5FU). The nature of binding between 5FU and gold nanoparticles via complexation is investigated using ultraviolet visible spectrophotometry, cyclic voltammetry, transmission electron microscopy, fluorescence and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The bound antileukemic drug is fluorescent and the quenching property of gold nanoparticles could be exploited for biological investigations. The 5FU-colloidal gold complex (Au@5FU) is observed to have appreciable antibacterial and antifungal activity against Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Aspergillus fumigatus, and Aspergillus niger. The experimental studies suggest that gold nanoparticles have the potential to be used as effective carriers for anticancer drugs.
TI  - Synthesis of pseudopeptides based L-tryptophan as a potential antimicrobial agent.
AB  - Four compounds named L-BTrpPA, L-Trp-o-PA, L-Trp-m-PA and L-Trp-p-PA, pseudopeptides constructed from pyridine and tryptophan units, were synthesized and tested against the Gram-positive, Gram-negative strains of bacteria and human pathogenic fungi. L-Trp-o-PA proved to be a broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent, showing a significant inhibition of the growth of Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus), and pathogenic fungi (Candida spp., Cryptococcus neoformans, Rhodotorula glutinis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Aspergillus spp., Rhizopus nigricans) tested and activity against Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus vulgaris, Enterobacter aerogenes) tested. The in vitro cell cytotoxicity of L-Trp-o-PA was evaluated using haemolytic assay, in which the compound was found to have low lytic property, even up to the concentration of 4000 microg/mL, it only lysed 6-7% of erythrocytes, which was 100-fold greater than the MICs (minimum inhibitory concentration).
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of long-chain, water-soluble, dendritic tricarboxylato amphiphiles.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To measure the antimicrobial activities of three series of homologous, dendritic tricarboxylato (three-headed) amphiphiles against a battery of bacteria and fungi. METHODS: Three series of homologous dendritic amphiphiles were synthesized containing C13 to C22 fatty chains. Susceptibility of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Lactobacillus plantarum, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Mycobacterium smegmatis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans and Aspergillus niger to the amphiphiles was measured by broth microdilution and reported as the MIC. RESULTS: Several amphiphiles from each homologous series, designed and constructed to overcome the low solubility of saturated long-chain fatty acids, had antimicrobial activity against MRSA (MIC = 36 mg/L), C. albicans (MIC = 4.4 mg/L), S. cerevisiae (MIC = 1.1 mg/L) and M. smegmatis (MIC = 8.9 mg/L). These amphiphiles had considerably better antimicrobial activities than the corresponding saturated fatty acids. Alkyl chain length influenced the values of MIC; longer chains (C18-C22) were generally more antimicrobial, but there was no uniform pattern among the microorganisms tested. CONCLUSIONS: As the antimicrobial activity of the amphiphiles increased with increasing chain length, it is anticipated that maximum activity was not reached with these series. Thus, the identification of the optimal chain length would provide a target compound for development of low-cost, topical microbicides and anti-infectives. Further, these series of dendritic amphiphiles with the very long chains can be used as new water-soluble probes for elucidation of membrane structure and for identification of novel targets for antimicrobial design.
TI  - Antimicrobial, wound healing and antioxidant activities of Anthocephalus cadamba.
AB  - Anthocephalus cadamba (Roxb.) Miq. Syn A. chinensis (Lamk) A. Rich (Rubiaceae) is ethnomedicinally widely used in the form of paste by tribe in western Ghats for treating skin diseases. In this context, antimicrobial potential of A. cadamba against a wide range of microorganisms was studied. To validate the ethnotherapeutic claims of the plant in skin diseases, wound healing activity was studied, besides antioxidant activity to understand the mechanism of wound healing. The alchoholic and aqueous extract of this plant showed significant antibacterial and antifungal activity against almost all the organisms: Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and four fungi Candida albicans, Trichophyton rubrum--dermatophyte fungi, Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus nidulans--systemic fungi, with especially good activity against the dermatophyte (Trichophyton rubrum) and some infectious bacteria (Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Staphylococcus aureus) with an MIC of 2.5 microg/disc. The results show that A. cadamba extract has potent wound healing capacity as shown from the wound contraction and increased tensile strength. The results also indicated that A. cadamba extract possesses potent antioxidant activity by inhibiting lipid peroxidation and increase in the superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase activity.
TI  - Total synthesis and biological evaluation of (-)-pectinatone employing a methyl-branched wax ester as key building block.
AB  - Unnatural (-)-pectinatone ((-)-3) was prepared in five steps starting from the highly methyl-branched wax ester 4, employing bromination of the ester enolate and subsequent base-induced elimination to the enoate 6 as the key step. Both (-)-3 and the amides 8b and 8c, which were isolated as by-products in the reaction sequence, displayed antimicrobial activity and cytotoxicity.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of Lucilia sericata maggot secretions.
AB  - Maggots of the green blowfly, Lucilia sericata, are used as an alternative to surgical intervention and long-term antiseptic therapy for the treatment of chronic wounds. The secretions of maggots are known to have antibacterial properties. To quantify the bactericidal effect of secretions from larvae of L. sericata, an in vitro test model based on the modified European quantitative suspension test (EN 1040) was developed, in which a co-culture of maggots and bacteria (Micrococcus luteus,Escherichia coli, methicillin-sensitive Staphylo-coccus aureus) in tryptic soy broth was tested. The numbers of bacterial colonies with and without maggot exposure were compared after 24, 48 and 72 h of exposure. The mean log(10) reduction factor (RF) for bacterial elimination per maggot was >4 at all examined times for all tested bacteria. Thus, maggot secretion fulfilled the required definitions of an antiseptic. In addition, the maggots' ability to ingest bacteria was also evaluated. Maggots contained viable bacteria after 48 h of contact with the respective organisms. These maggots also continued excreting bacteria. Therefore, maggots should be disposed of after use as they must be regarded as medical waste.
TI  - ird1 is a Vps15 homologue important for antibacterial immune responses in Drosophila.
AB  - The immune response-deficient 1 (ird1) gene was identified in a forward genetic screen as a novel regulator for the activation of Imd NFkappaB immune signalling pathway in Drosophila. ird1 animals are also more susceptible to Escherichia coli and Micrococcus luteus bacterial infection. ird1 encodes the Drosophila homologue of the Vps15/p150 serine/threonine kinase that regulates a class III phosphoinositide 3-kinase and is necessary for phagosome maturation and starvation-induced autophagy in yeast and mammalian cells. To gain insight into the role of ird1 in the immune response, we examine how amino acid starvation affects the immune signalling pathways in Drosophila. Starvation, in the absence of infection, leads to expression of antimicrobial peptide (AMP) genes and this response is dependent on ird1 and the Imd immune signalling pathway. Starvation, in addition to bacterial infection, suppresses the AMP response in wild-type animals and reduces the ability to survive M. luteus infection. Our results suggest that starvation and innate immune signalling may be intimately linked processes.
TI  - Structural and biological characterization of one antibacterial acylpolyamine isolated from the hemocytes of the spider Acanthocurria gomesiana.
AB  - We have isolated a 417Da antibacterial molecule, named mygalin, from the hemocytes of the spider Acanthoscurria gomesiana. The structure of mygalin was elucidated by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) and by two spectroscopic techniques, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and ultraviolet (UV) spectroscopy. Mygalin was identified as bis-acylpolyamine N1,N8-bis(2,5-dihydroxybenzoyl)spermidine, in which the primary amino groups of the spermidine are acylated with the carboxyl group of the 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid. Mygalin was active against Escherichia coli at 85muM, being this activity inhibited completely by catalase. Therefore, the antibacterial activity of mygalin was attributed to its production of hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)). The putative mechanisms of formation of H(2)O(2) from mygalin are discussed. To our knowledge this is the first report of one bis-acylpolyamine with antibacterial activity purified from animal source.
TI  - Silica xerogel-hydrogen peroxide composites: their morphology, stability, and antimicrobial activity.
AB  - Hydrogen peroxide was incorporated into silica xerogel matrix over the concentration range from 3.8 to 68.0 wt% via the sol-gel route. The obtained composites were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The release rates of H(2)O(2) from the composites into the aqueous phase were examined. In most cases, a 90% release was attained after ca. 10 min, and it was only slightly dependent on H(2)O(2) concentration and particle size. The antimicrobial activity of the composite containing 3.59% H(2)O(2) was evaluated against Escherichia coli and Micrococcus luteus. A comparative assay was carried out for aqueous solution of H(2)O(2) of the same concentration. The results demonstrated a potent microbicidal efficacy of the composite. Furthermore, diffusion range of the hydrogen peroxide from the solid composite into an agar medium matched that of the H(2)O(2) in aqueous solution. The stability tests with the xerogels containing 3.8, 26.4, and 68.0% of H(2)O(2) showed that after 63 days respective losses of the H(2)O(2) at 3 degrees C were 8.8, 9.7, and 6.2%. Both the DSC results and the stability tests have shown that the molecular water present in the pores stabilizes the composite, probably through improving the binding of the H(2)O(2) molecules onto the silica surface.
TI  - Molecular cloning and mRNA expression of peptidoglycan recognition protein (PGRP) gene in bay scallop (Argopecten irradians, Lamarck 1819).
AB  - Peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRPs) are a type of pattern recognition molecules (PRM) that recognize the unique cell wall component peptidoglycan (PGN) of bacteria and are involved in innate immunity. The first bivalve PGRP cDNA sequence was cloned from bay scallop Argopecten irradians by expressed sequence tag (EST) and PCR technique. The full-length cDNA of bay scallop PGRP (designated AiPGRP) gene contained 1018bp with a 615-bp open reading frame that encoded a polypeptide of 205 amino acids. The predicted amino acid sequence of AiPGRP shared high identity with PGRP in other organisms, such as PGRP precursor in Trichoplusia ni and PGRP SC2 in Drosophila melanogaster. A quantitative reverse transcriptase Real-Time PCR (qRT-PCR) assay was developed to assess the mRNA expression of AiPGRP in different tissues and the temporal expression of AiPGRP in the mixed primary cultured hemocytes challenged by microbial components lipopolyssacharide (LPS) from Escherichia coli and PGN from Micrococcus luteus. Higher-level mRNA expression of AiPGRP was detected in the tissues of hemocytes, gonad and kidney. The expression of AiPGRP in the mixed primary cultured hemocytes was up regulated after stimulated by PGN, while LPS from E. coli did not induce AiPGRP expression. The results indicated that AiPGRP was a constitutive and inducible expressed protein that was mainly induced by PGN and could be involved in scallop immune response against Gram-positive bacteria infection.
TI  - Phytochemical constituents from Salsola tetrandra.
AB  - The new norisoprenoid 3beta-hydroxy-5alpha,6alpha-epoxy-beta-ionone-2alpha-O-beta-d-glucopyranoside (1) and the long-chain hydroxy fatty acids 9,12,13-trihydroxyoctadeca-10(E),15(Z)-dienoic acid (2) and 9,12,13-trihydroxyoctadeca-10(E)-dienoic acid (3) were isolated from Salsola tetrandra aerial parts, together with 3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl-beta-d-glucopyranoside (4), 9-hydroxylinaloyl glucoside (5), taxiphyllin (6), trans-N-feruloyltyramine (7), and S-(-)-trans-N-feruloyloctopamine (8). Their structures were elucidated by extensive spectroscopic analysis and chemical methods. Compounds 6 and 8 displayed mild antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, whereas compound 6 showed the highest activity in the Artemia salina bioassay.
TI  - Synthesis, structure and biological activity of cobalt(II) and copper(II) complexes of valine-derived schiff bases.
AB  - We have synthesized two cobalt(II) 2 and copper(II) 3 complexes of valine-derived Schiff bases. The obtained complexes were characterized by elemental analysis, FT-IR and X-ray diffraction. Biological studies of complexes 2 and 3 had been carried out in vitro for antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive, Gram-negative bacteria and human pathogenic fungi. Compound 3 was proven to be a broad spectrum agent, showed a significant inhibition of the growth of Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus), and pathogenic fungi (Candida spp., Cryptococcus neoformans, Rhodothece glutinis, Saccharomyces cerevisia, Aspergillus spp., Rhizopus nigricans) tested and a moderate activity against Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus vulgaris and Enterobacter aerogenes) tested. The in vitro cytotoxicity of compound 3 was evaluated using hemolytic assay, in which the compound 3 was found to be non-toxic to human erythrocytes even at a concentration of 500mug/mL.
TI  - Proteome modifications of the medicinal leech nervous system under bacterial challenge.
AB  - Once considered as lacking intrinsic immune mechanisms, the CNS of vertebrates is now known to be capable of mounting its own innate immune response. Interestingly, while invertebrates have been very useful in the interpretation of general vertebrate innate immunity mechanisms, only scarce data are available on the immune response of nervous tissue within this group. This study provides new data on the innate immune response of medicinal leech Hirudo medicinalis CNS. We identified several spots in 2-D gels of leech CNS proteins that showed specific changes following bacterial challenge, thus demonstrating the ability of the leech nervous system to mount a response to an immune stress. Protein identifications were based on comparison of sequence data with publicly available databases and a recently established leech ESTs database. The broad nature of the identified proteins suggests a clear involvement of cytoskeletal rearrangements, endoplasmic reticulum stress, modulation of synaptic activity and calcium mobilization, all during the first 24 hours of this response. Moreover, several of these proteins are specifically expressed in glial cells, suggesting an important role for glial cells in the immune response of the leech nervous system, similar to what has been observed in vertebrates.
TI  - Structure-activity relationships in nitrothiophenes.
AB  - The structure and electronic properties of a series of biologically active 2-nitrothiophenes (1) have been calculated using both semi-empirical and ab initio molecular orbital methods. Multi-linear regression analysis suggests that there is a reasonable correlation between the experimental activity of the derivatives against either Escherichia coli or Micrococcus luteus and calculated properties such as the HOMO energies, the total atomic charges and ring angles at the heterocyclic sulfur atom, but there is no correlation with the calculated solvation energies or dipole moments. The presence or absence of an additional nitro group at the 3-position of the ring also has a significant effect on the activity. From the derived QSAR equations, the 2-chloro- or 2-bromo-3,5-dinitrothiophenes (1a and 1c) are predicted to show the highest activity against both bacteria, while 2-nitrothiophene (1n) is predicted to be the least active, in line with the experimental results.
TI  - Analysis of bacteria-challenged wild silkmoth, Antheraea mylitta (lepidoptera) transcriptome reveals potential immune genes.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In the recent years a strong resemblance has been observed between the insect immune system and the mammalian innate immune mechanisms suggesting their common origin. Among the insects, only the dipterans (Drosophila and various mosquito species) have been widely investigated for their immune responses towards diverse pathogens. In the present study we constructed and analysed the immune transcriptome of the lepidopteran Antheraea mylitta, an economically important Indian tasar silkmoth with a view to unravel the potential immune-related genes and pathways. RESULTS: An expressed sequence tag (EST) library was constructed from mRNA obtained from fat bodies of A. mylitta larvae that had been challenged by infection with Escherichia coli cells. We identified 719 unique ESTs from a total of 1412 sequences so generated. A third of the transcriptome showed similarity with previously characterized immune-related genes that included both the known and putative immune genes. Of the four putative novel defence proteins (DFPs) annotated by PSI-BLAST three showed similarity to extracellular matrix proteins from vertebrates implicated in innate immunity, while the fourth was similar to, yet distinct from, the anti-microbial protein cecropin. Finally, we analysed the expression profiles of 15 potential immune-related genes, and the majority of them were induced more prominently with E. coli compared to Micrococcus luteus. We also identified several unknown proteins, some of which could have probable immune-related functions based on the results of the ProDom analysis. CONCLUSION: The present study has identified many potential immune-related genes in A. mylitta some of which are vertebrate homologues and others are hitherto unreported putative defence proteins. Several genes were present as members of gene families, as has also been observed in other insect species.
TI  - DNase II deficiency impairs innate immune function in Drosophila.
AB  - DNase II enzymes are highly conserved proteins that are required for the degradation of DNA within phagolysosomes. Engulfment of apoptotic cells and/or bacteria by phagocytic cells requires the function of DNase II to completely destroy ingested DNA. Mutation of the dnase II gene results in an increase of undegraded apoptotic DNA within phagocytic cells in mice and nematodes. Additionally, reduction of DNase II enzymatic activity in Drosophila melanogaster has been shown to lead to increased accumulation of DNA in the ovaries. Due to the importance of DNA clearance during infection, we hypothesized that a severe reduction of DNase II activity would result in diminished immune function and viability. To test this hypothesis, we knocked down DNase II activity in flies using RNAi. As expected, expression of a dnase II-RNAi construct in flies resulted in a dramatic reduction of DNase II activity and a significant decrease in total hemocyte numbers. Furthermore, infection of dnase II-RNAi flies with Gram negative or positive bacteria resulted in a severe reduction in fly viability. These results confirm that DNase II and the ability to clear macromolecular DNA is essential for maintaining proper immune function in Drosophila.
TI  - Bacterial inactivation using a low-temperature atmospheric plasma brush sustained with argon gas.
AB  - This study investigated the bacterial inactivation/sterilization effects of a new atmospheric plasma source, which is a brush-shaped argon glow discharge created under 1 atm pressure. Such an atmospheric plasma brush requires extremely low power of less than 20 W to operate; and therefore is essentially a low-temperature discharge as confirmed by gas-phase temperature measurements. Two bacteria, Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Micrococcus luteus (M. luteus), seeded in various media were subjected to plasma treatment and their survivability was examined. It was found that such argon atmospheric plasma brush is very effective in destruction of the bacteria cells. With nutrient broth and standard methods agar as supporting media, a cell reduction in a level of 6 orders of magnitude was observed for E. coli within 3-4 min plasma treatment. A similar level of cell reduction was also observed for M. luteus in the two media with 2 or 3 min plasma treatment. The plasma treatment effects on the bacteria cell structures were also examined using scanning electron microscopy and the cell structure damages due to the plasma exposure were observed on both bacteria. The possible sterilization mechanism of the argon plasmas is also discussed in this article.
TI  - Cytotoxic, antioxidant and antibacterial activities of Varthemia iphionoides Boiss. extracts.
AB  - The hexane, ethyl acetate, chloroform, ethanol and water extracts of aerial parts of Varthemia, Varthemia iphionoides, were investigated for cytotoxic activity against human myelocytic leukemia (HL-60) cells; DPPH radical-scavenging activity; antioxidative activity in the linoleic acid system; reducing power; antibacterial activity; the contents of phenolic compounds. A pronounced cytotoxic effect on human leukemia (HL-60) cells was shown in the hexane, chloroform and ethanol extracts, with inhibition of 89.0, 68.4 and 62.3%, respectively, at a concentration of 200 microg extract/ml. High DPPH radical-scavenging activity, antioxidative activity in the linoleic acid system and reducing power were found in the water and ethanol extracts, and were correlated to the contents of phenolic compounds. Antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus and Salmonella enteritides was shown in the ethyl acetate and chloroform extracts. A compound responsible for the antibacterial activity was isolated from the ethyl acetate extract, and identified as 3-oxocostusic acid.
TI  - Cloning and characterization of a novel C-type lectin from Zhikong scallop Chlamys farreri.
AB  - C-type lectin is a family of Ca2+ dependent carbohydrate-recognition proteins which play crucial roles in the innate immunity of invertebrates by mediating the recognition of host cells to pathogens and clearing microinvaders as a pattern recognition protein (PRP). The cDNA of Zhikong scallop Chlamys farreri C-type lectin (designated CFLec-1) was cloned by expressed sequence tag (EST) and RACE techniques. The full-length cDNA of CFLec-1 was 1785 bp, consisting of a 5'-terminal untranslated region (UTR) of 66 bp and an unusually long 3' UTR of 1040 bp with seven polyadenylation signal sequences AATAAA and a poly(A) tail. The CFLec-1 cDNA encoded a polypeptide of 221 amino acids with a putative signal peptide of 15 amino acid residues and a mature protein of 206 amino acids. Analysis of the protein domain features indicated a typical long-form carbohydrate-recognition domain (CRD) of 130 residues in the CFLec-1 deduced amino acid sequence. The expression pattern of CFLec-1 transcripts in healthy and bacterial challenged scallops was studied by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. mRNA transcripts of CFLec-1 could be mainly detected in the tissues of haemocytes, gill, gonad and mantle of unchallenged scallops, whereas the expression of CFLec-1 transcripts was increased in all the tested tissues after heat-killed Vibrio anguillarum challenge. The temporal expression of CFLec-1 mRNA in haemolymph challenged by Micrococcus luteus and V. anguillarum was both up-regulated and reached the maximum level at 8 and 16 h post stimulation, respectively, and then dropped back to the original level. In order to investigate its immune functions, CFLec-1 was recombined and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)-pLysS as a fusion protein with thioredoxin. The recombinant CFLec-1 agglutinated bacteria E. coli JM109 in vitro, and the agglutination was Ca2+ dependent which could be inhibited by EDTA. But it did not agglutinate M. luteus, Candida lipolytica and animal erythrocytes including rabbit, rat, mouse, chicken, human group A, human group B, human group O. Meanwhile, the recombinant CFLec-1 could inhibit the growth of both E. coli JM109 and M. luteus, but no inhibition activity against V. anguillarum. These result indicated that CFLec-1 was a constitutive and inducible PRP which was involved in the reorganization and clearance of invaders in scallop.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of four antibacterial peptides from bovine hemoglobin.
AB  - Peptic digestion of bovine hemoglobin at low degree of hydrolysis yields several  intermediate peptide fractions after separation by reversed phase HPLC exhibiting antibacterial activity against Micrococcus luteus A270, Listeria innocua, Escherichia coli, and Salmonella enteritidis. From these fractions, four new antibacterial peptides were isolated and analyzed by ESI-MS/MS. Three of these peptides correspond to fragments of the alpha-chain of bovine hemoglobin: alpha107-141, alpha137-141, and alpha133-141, and one peptide to the beta-chain: beta126-145. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of these peptides towards the four strains and their hemolytic activity towards bovine erythrocytes were determined.
TI  - Search for antibacterial and antifungal agents from selected Indian medicinal plants.
AB  - A series of 61 Indian medicinal plants belonging to 33 different families used in various infectious disorders, were screened for their antimicrobial properties. Screening was carried out at 1000 and 500 microg/ml concentrations by agar dilution method against Bacillus cereus var mycoides, Bacillus pumilus, Bacillus subtilis, Bordetella bronchiseptica, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus faecalis, Candida albicans, Aspergillus niger and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Twenty-eight plant extracts showed activity against at least one of the test organisms used in the screening. On the basis of the results obtained, we conclude that the crude extracts of Dorema ammoniacum, Sphaeranthus indicus, Dracaena cinnabari, Mallotus philippinensis, Jatropha gossypifolia, Aristolochia indica, Lantana camara, Nardostachys jatamansi, Randia dumetorum and Cassia fistula exhibited significant antimicrobial activity and properties that support folkloric use in the treatment of some diseases as broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents. This probably explains the use of these plants by the indigenous people against a number of infections.
TI  - Antibacterial non-glycosidase activity of invertebrate destabilase-lysozyme and of its helical amphipathic peptides.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Since bactericidal properties of some lysozymes are independent of their glycosidase activity, we have investigated this phenomenon for destabilase-lysozyme (DL) from medicinal leech (Hirudo medicinalis). METHODS: Glycosidase activity was determined on Micrococcus luteus, non-enzymatic antibacterial activity of heat-treated DL and of synthetic peptides alpha1, alpha2 and alpha3 (fragments of its primary structure) on M. luteus, Escherichia coli, Bacillus brevis and Streptomyces chrysomallus. RESULTS: Glycosidase activity disappeared after the heating of native DL at 100 degrees C for 40 min. Antibacterial activity of heat-treated DL for M. luteus MDMSU128 and MDMSU140 expressed as minimal inhibitory concentration was 9.8.10(-8) and 12.10(-8) M, respectively, and to E. coli MDMSU52 11.10(-8) M. Antibacterial activity of synthetic peptide alpha1 for M. luteus MDMSU128 and for E. coli MDMSU52 was 8.3.10(-5) and 4.9.10(-5) M, respectively. CONCLUSION: DL is the first invertebrate lysozyme with combined enzymatic and non-enzymatic antibacterial action.
TI  - Antifungal and antibacterial activities of Araucaria araucana (Mol.) K. Koch heartwood lignans.
AB  - Five lignans (secoisolariciresinol, pinoresinol, eudesmin, lariciresinol, and lariciresinol-4-methyl ether) were isolated from an MeOH extract from Araucaria araucana (Mol.) K. Koch wood for the first time in this species and their structures determined with spectroscopic methods. The antimicrobial activities of these compounds were determined for the bacteria Citrobacter sp., Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and for the white rooting and staining fungi Mucor miehei, Paecilomyces variotii, Ceratocystis pilifera, Trametes versicolor, and Penicillium notatum, and in addition, the MeOH extract was evaluated against Aspergillus niger, Candida albicans, Fusarium moniliforme, F. sporotrichum and Trichophyton mentagrophytes. The most sensitive bacteria against pinoresinol were the Gram-positive. However, secoisolariciresinol exhibited a significant antifungal activity on fungi of white rooting and wood staining and this compound completely inhibited the mycelial growth of T. versicolor and C. pilifera at 300 and 400 microg per disc, respectively, whereas pinoresinol showed a moderate inhibitory activity. On the other hand, the MeOH extract had the highest activity against rooting and staining and pathogenic fungi as well as T. versicolor, Fusarium spp. and Trichophyton mentagrophytes, inhibiting completely the growth at 400 microg per disc.
TI  - Antimicrobial, wound healing and antioxidant activity of Plagiochasma appendiculatum Lehm. et Lind.
AB  - Plagiochasma appendiculatum (Aytoniaceae) of the order Marchantiales is widely used in the form of paste ethnomedicinally by Gaddi tribe in Kangra valley for treating skin diseases. In this context, antimicrobical potential of Plagiochasma appendiculatum against a wide range of microorganisms was studied. To validate the ethnotherapeutic claims of the plant in skin diseases, wound healing activity was studied, besides antioxidant activity to understand the mechanism of wound healing activity. The plant (alchoholic and aqueous extract) showed significant antibacterial and antifungal activity against almost all the organisms: Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium, and eight fungi Candida albicans and Cryptococcus albidus-dimorphic fungi, Trichophyton rubrum-dermatophyte fungi, Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus spinulosus, Aspergillus terreus and Aspergillus nidulans-systemic fungi, with especially good activity against the dermatophyte (Trichophyton rubrum) and some infectious bacteria (Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Salmonella typhimurium) with an MIC of 2.5 microg/disc. The results show that Plagiochasma appendiculatum extract has potent wound healing capacity as evident from the wound contraction and increased tensile strength. The results also indicated that Plagiochasma appendiculatum extract possesses potent antioxidant activity by inhibiting lipid peroxidation and increase in the superoxide dismutase (SOD) and Catalase activity.
TI  - DNA buoyant density shifts during 15N-DNA stable isotope probing.
AB  - DNA-based stable isotope probing (SIP) is a novel technique for the identification of organisms actively assimilating isotopically labeled compounds. Herein, we define the limitations to using 15N-labeled substrates for SIP and propose modifications to compensate for these shortcomings. Changes in DNA buoyant density (BD) resulting from 15N incorporation were determined using cultures of disparate GC content (Escherichia coli and Micrococcus luteus). Incorporation of 15N into DNA increased BD by 0.015+/-0.002 g mL(-1) for E. coli and 0.013+/-0.002 g mL(-1) for M. luteus. The DNA BD shift was greatly increased (0.045 g mL(-1)) when dual isotope (13C plus 15N) labeling was employed. Despite the limited DNA BD shift following 15N enrichment, we found the use of gradient fractionation, followed by a comparison of T-RFLP profiles from fractions of labeled and control treatments, facilitated detection of enrichment in DNA samples from either cultures or soil.
TI  - RNA interference directs innate immunity against viruses in adult Drosophila.
AB  - Innate immunity against bacterial and fungal pathogens is mediated by Toll and immune deficiency (Imd) pathways, but little is known about the antiviral response in Drosophila. Here, we demonstrate that an RNA interference pathway protects adult flies from infection by two evolutionarily diverse viruses. Our work also describes a molecular framework for the viral immunity, in which viral double-stranded RNA produced during infection acts as the pathogen trigger whereas Drosophila Dicer-2 and Argonaute-2 act as host sensor and effector, respectively. These findings establish a Drosophila model for studying the innate immunity against viruses in animals.
TI  - Design, synthesis, antibacterial, and QSAR studies of myristic acid derivatives.
AB  - A series of esters and amides of myristic acid was synthesized and tested in vitro for antibacterial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. All the compounds showed activity comparable to that of the standard drug, ciprofloxacin. The structural characteristics governing antibacterial activity of myristic acid derivatives was studied using QSAR methodology. The results showed that the antibacterial activity could be modeled using the topological descriptor, valence molecular connectivity index. The predictive ability of the models was cross-validated by construction of a test set. The low residual activity and high cross-validated r2 values (r(cv)2) observed indicated the predictive ability of the developed QSAR models.
TI  - Investigation of the cytotoxicity of eukaryotic and prokaryotic antimicrobial peptides in intestinal epithelial cells in vitro.
AB  - Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are a diverse group of proteinaceous compounds ranging in size, complexity and antimicrobial spectrum. The activity of AMPs against gut pathogens warrants the study of the interaction of AMPs with the mammalian gastrointestinal tract. In particular, the investigation of the in vitro cytotoxicity of these peptides is critical before they can be considered in clinical infections. The cytotoxicity of gallidermin, nisin A, natural magainin peptides, and melittin was investigated in two gastrointestinal cell models (HT29 and Caco-2) with the MTT conversion assay, neutral red dye uptake assay and compared with that of vancomycin. The hemolytic activities were also investigated in sheep erythrocytes and the effect of AMPs on paracellular permeability was examined by transepithelial resistance (TEER) and TEM. Gallidermin was the least cytotoxic AMP followed by nisin A, magainin I, magainin II and melittin. Melittin and nisin were the only peptides to result in significant hemolysis. However, while nisin caused hemolysis at concentrations which were 1000-fold higher than those required for antimicrobial activity, melittin was hemolytic at concentrations in the same order of magnitude as its antimicrobial activity. Melittin was the only AMP to affect paracellular permeability. Long term melittin treatment also resulted in loss of microvilli, an increase in cell debris and destruction of intestinal tight junctions and cell-cell adhesion. Gallidermin shows most promise as a therapeutic agent, with relatively low cytotoxicity and potent antimicrobial activities. Melittin, while showing little potential as an antimicrobial agent, may have potential in delivery of poorly bioavailable drugs.
TI  - Identification of new immune induced molecules in the haemolymph of Drosophila melanogaster by 2D-nanoLC MS/MS.
AB  - Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) play an important role in the innate immunity of insects. In Drosophila 17 additional immune induced molecules (DIMs) were found in the haemolymph of adult flies upon septic injury. Previous studies using MALDI mass spectrometry combined with Edman degradation, detected AMPs and DIMs of a predominantly large size. By means of 2D-nanoLC ESI MS/MS, 43 DIMs were identified in this study from the haemolymph of Drosophila third instar larvae 12h after challenge with a mixture of Micrococcus luteus and Escherichia coli. Most peptides were derived from known AMP or DIM precursors, but only four peptides were purified and identified before. The majority of the peptides that we detected were smaller in size. Interestingly, two previously unknown peptide precursors were found and hereby related to immune defense. These include CG7738 and CG32185. Many of the identified peptides are post-translationally modified by an N-terminal pyroglutamic acid and/or a C-terminal amide. Haemolymph of control larvae was treated in the same way and revealed only one peptide.
TI  - Rapid high-throughput assessment of aerobic bacteria in complex samples by fluorescence-based oxygen respirometry.
AB  - A simple method has been developed for the analysis of aerobic bacteria in complex samples such as broth and food homogenates. It employs commercial phosphorescent oxygen-sensitive probes to monitor oxygen consumption of samples containing bacteria using standard microtiter plates and fluorescence plate readers. As bacteria grow in aqueous medium, at certain points they begin to deplete dissolved oxygen, which is seen as an increase in probe fluorescence above baseline signal. The time required to reach threshold signal is used to either enumerate bacteria based on a predetermined calibration or to assess the effects of various effectors on the growth of test bacteria by comparison with an untreated control. This method allows for the sensitive (down to a single cell), rapid (0.5 to 12 h) enumeration of aerobic bacteria without the need to conduct lengthy (48 to 72 h) and tedious colony counts on agar plates. It also allows for screening a wide range of chemical and environmental samples for their toxicity. These assays have been validated with different bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, and Pseudomonas fluorescens, with the enumeration of total viable counts in broth and industrial food samples (packaged ham, chicken, and mince meat), and comparison with established agar plating and optical-density-at-600-nm assays has been given.
TI  - Combined Plate Microbial Assay (CPMA): a 6-plate-method for simultaneous first and second level screening of antibacterial residues in meat.
AB  - This paper proposes an improved high throughput microbial method for the simultaneous performance of first and second level screening for antibacterial residues in meat. It is based on growth inhibition of B. subtilis on agar medium pH 6, 7.2 and 8, of B. cereus on agar medium pH 5.9, of M. luteus on agar medium pH 8 and of E. coli on agar medium pH 7.2 (research or first level screening) and on the use of confirmatory solutions (Pase, Paba, MgSO4) for the identification or second level screening. In kidney control samples, dialysis membranes were interposed between samples and the agar surface to both prevent the action of lysozyme and reduce false positive results. The proposed method detects beta-lactams, sulfonamides, tetracyclines, aminoglycosides, macrolides and quinolones at MRL concentrations and reliably indicates the inhibitor family. Results are obtained in 18-24 h.
TI  - Studies on the biological activity of some nitrothiophenes.
AB  - The biological activity of nineteen substituted thiophenes (3) have been assessed by evaluating the minimum inhibitory concentration required to inhibit the growth of E. coli, M. luteus and A. niger. The series displays a wide range of activities with 2-chloro-3,5-dinitrothiophene (3a) or 2-bromo-3,5-dinitrothiophene (3c) showing the highest activity against all three organisms, while the simplest compound of the series, 2-nitrothiophene (3s) shows the smallest activity in each case. The mode of action of 3a and 3c is thought to involve nucleophilic attack by intracellular thiols at the 2-position of the heterocyclic ring leading to displacement of halogen, but other active derivatives, such as 2,4-dinitrothiophene (3h) and 5-nitrothiophene-2-carbaldehyde (3d) which have no displaceable halogen or leaving group are thought to act by forming Meisenheimer complexes.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Bryum argenteum.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of Bryum argenteum ethanol extracts was evaluated by microdilution method against four bacterial (Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus and Staphilococcus aureus) and four fungal species (Aspergillus niger, Penicillium ochrochloron, Candida albicans and Trichophyton mentagrophyes). All the investigated ethanol extracts have been proved to be active against all bacteria and fungi tested.
TI  - Evaluation of different methods for nucleic acids quantification.
AB  
TI  - Muralytic activity of Micrococcus luteus Rpf and its relationship to physiological activity in promoting bacterial growth and resuscitation.
AB  - The culturability of several actinobacteria is controlled by resuscitation-promoting factors (Rpfs). These are proteins containing a c. 70-residue domain that adopts a lysozyme-like fold. The invariant catalytic glutamate residue found in lysozyme and various bacterial lytic transglycosylases is also conserved in the Rpf proteins. Rpf from Micrococcus luteus, the founder member of this protein family, is indeed a muralytic enzyme, as revealed by its activity in zymograms containing M. luteus cell walls and its ability to (i) cause lysis of Escherichia coli when expressed and secreted into the periplasm; (ii) release fluorescent material from fluorescamine-labelled cell walls of M. luteus; and (iii) hydrolyse the artificial lysozyme substrate, 4-methylumbelliferyl-beta-D-N,N',N''-triacetylchitotrioside. Rpf activity was reduced but not completely abolished when the invariant glutamate residue was altered. Moreover, none of the other acidic residues in the Rpf domain was absolutely required for muralytic activity. Replacement of one or both of the cysteine residues that probably form a disulphide bridge within Rpf impaired but did not completely abolish muralytic activity. The muralytic activities of the Rpf mutants were correlated with their abilities to stimulate bacterial culturability and resuscitation, consistent with the view that the biological activity of Rpf results directly or indirectly from its ability to cleave bonds in bacterial peptidoglycan.
TI  - Multiarray sensors with pattern recognition for the detection, classification, and differentiation of bacteria at subspecies and strain levels.
AB  - This work describes the integration of a fully autonomous electrochemical biosensor with pattern recognition techniques for the detection and classification of bacteria at subspecies and strain level. The system provides a continuous, real-time monitoring of bacteria activity upon exposure to antibiotics. The system utilizes 96-well-type electrodes array (DOX-dissolved oxygen sensor) with principal component analysis (PCA) for rapid and routine classification of different classes of bacteria and related strains. A representative sample of a section of the bacteria kingdom has been analyzed and classified using the proposed DOX-PCA system, including the following: Corynebacterium glutamicum, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Yersinia ruckeri, Escherichia adecarboxylata, Comamonas acidovorans, Alcaligenes odorans, Bacillus globigii, and three strains of Escherichia coli (K12, SM10, ATCC 25922). The new classification scheme is based on the hypothesis that, under identical experimental conditions, various bacteria consume oxygen at different rates and are affected in different ways by selected antibiotics. Thus, the response of the individual electrode in the array is indirectly altered, compared to that of cells growing on medium, by the addition of the antibiotic. By using three different antibiotics in separate wells, a unique fingerprint can be created for a specific bacterium. With the proposed DOX-PCA system, classification of bacteria was achieved at subspecies and strain level in real time. This study represents a basic research tool that may allow researchers to rapidly detect, quantify, and classify bacteria type at subspecies and strain levels.
TI  - Cell adsorption and selective desorption for separation of microbial cells by using chitosan-immobilized silica.
AB  - Cell adsorption and selective desorption for separation of microbial cells were conducted by using chitosan-immobilized silica (CIS). When chitosan was immobilized onto silica surfaces with glutaraldehyde, bacterial cells adsorbed well and retained viability. Testing of the adsorption and desorption ability of CIS using various microbes such as Escherichia coli, Aeromonas hydrophila, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Lactobacillus casei, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Streptococcus salivarius, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Saccharomyces ludwigii, and Schizosaccharomyces pombe revealed that most microbes could be adsorbed and selectively desorbed under different conditions. In particular, recovery was improved when L-cysteine was added. A mixture of two bacterial strains adsorbed onto CIS could also be successfully separated by use of specific solutions for each strain. Most of the desorbed cells were alive. Thus, quantitative and selective fractionation of cells is readily achievable by employing chitosan, a known antibacterial material.
TI  - Peptidoglycan recognition by the Drosophila Imd pathway.
AB  - The structural requirements for recognition of peptidoglycan (PGN) by PGRP-LC and activation of the Drosophila IMD pathway are not yet clear. In order to examine this question more carefully, the activity of peptidoglycan from different types of bacteria was compared in cell-based and whole animal assays. Drosophila S2* cells, but not adult flies, responded to Lys-type Micrococcus luteus PGN, but with significantly less potency compared to Dap-type Escherichia coli PGN, while intact Lys-type PGN from Staphylococcus aureus was inactive. After treatment with lysostaphin, which digests the cross-bridging peptides, S. aureus PGN weakly stimulated the IMD pathway, similar to M. luteus PGN. Further digestion with mutanolysin, which creates monomeric PGN fragments, abolished the activity of S. aureus PGN. On the other hand, monomeric E. coli PGN, generated by mutanolysin digestion, was still active but required different isoforms of PGRP-LC for recognition. Polymeric PGN required only PGRP-LCx, while monomeric E. coli PGN required both the PGRP-LCa and PGRP-LCx isoforms. These results suggest that the recognition by PGRP-LCx alone requires polymeric PGN, and that polymeric Dap-type PGN is a more potent PGRP-LCx agonist, compared to Lys-type PGN. These results also suggest that the heteromeric PGRP-LCa/LCx receptor complex recognizes monomeric Dap-type, but not Lys-type, PGN.
TI  - Immune challenge differentially affects transcript abundance of three antimicrobial peptides in hemocytes from the moth Pseudoplusia includens.
AB  - Inducible expression of antimicrobial peptides and other humoral immune factors by the insect fat body is well documented. Hemocytes comprise the second essential arm of the insect immune system but it is unclear whether antimicrobial peptide genes are expressed by all or only some types of hemocytes. Here we report the cloning of cecropin A (Pi-cecA), lebocin (Pi-leb) and lysozyme (Pi-lys) homologs from the moth Pseudoplusia includens. Relative-quantitative real-time PCR (rq-rtPCR) indicated that transcript abundance for each antimicrobial gene increased in fat body and hemocytes following immune challenge with the Gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli. Relative transcript abundance of Pi-cecA was much higher in fat body than hemocytes. In contrast, transcript levels of Pi-leb were three-fold lower in hemocytes than fat body while transcript levels of Pi-lys were three-fold higher. Estimates for the overall contribution of the fat body and hemocytes to antimicrobial peptide expression suggested that hemocytes contribute significantly to Pi-lys transcript levels in larvae but produce much smaller amounts of Pi-cecA and Pi-leb compared to the fat body. Each antimicrobial peptide was also inducibly expressed in hemocytes following challenge with the Gram-positive bacterium Micrococcus luteus or when hemocytes formed capsules around chromatography beads. Analysis of hemocyte types indicated that granulocytes and plasmatocytes expressed all three antimicrobial peptides, whereas spherule cells and oenocytoids expressed only lysozyme. Transcriptional profiles of these antimicrobial genes were similar in granulocytes and plasmatocytes in vivo but were very different in vitro.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of 2-arylbenzofurans from Morus species against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Nine 2-arylbenzofurans isolated from Morus species were tested for their antimicrobial activities against methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Among these compounds, chalcomoracin (a leaf phytoalexine of mulberry tree) exhibited considerable antibacterial activity against MRSAs (MICs 0.78 mug/ml).
TI  - Antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, anti-cholinesterase and mutagenic effects of extracts obtained from some trees used in South African traditional medicine.
AB  - Extracts obtained from 10 trees used in South African traditional medicine were screened for antibacterial, anti-inflammatory (COX-1 and COX-2) and anti-cholinesterase activities and investigated for potential mutagenic effects using the Ames test. Antibacterial activity was detected using the disc-diffusion and micro-dilution assays. The extracts were tested against Gram-positive bacteria: Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Micrococcus luteus and Gram-negative bacteria: Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Of the 78 different plant extracts investigated, 80% showed activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria in the disc-diffusion assay. In the micro-dilution assay, 60% of the plant extracts showed minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values < or =1.56 mg ml(-1). The lowest MIC value (0.092 mg ml(-1)) was recorded for an ethyl acetate root extract of Acacia sieberiana against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. In the anti-inflammatory assay, 70% of the investigated plant extracts (0.25 mg ml(-1)) inhibited both COX-1 and COX-2 activity (>50% and 70% for water and organic solvent extracts, respectively). An ethyl acetate leaf extract of Trichilia dregeana showed selective inhibition of COX-2 (81%). In the acetylcholinesterase inhibitory test, 21% of the plant extracts were active at a concentration < or =1 mg ml(-1) using the micro-dilution assay. The lowest IC(50) value was 0.04 mg ml(-1) obtained with an ethanol bark extract of Combretum kraussii. None of the investigated plants showed any potential mutagenic effects.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens phage endolysin without holin conjugation.
AB  - To characterize the enzymatic activity and antibacterial activity of endolysin encoded by a Bacillus amyloliquefaciens phage, the open reading frame encoding endolysin was amplified by PCR and cloned into the expression plasmid pET21d(+). The resultant plasmid was used to transform Escherichia coli JM109(DE3). Production of endolysin in the cytosol facilitated cell lysis without coproduction of holin, which is considered to degrade or alter the cytoplasmic membrane. The phage endolysin was overexpressed and purified. Although the specific activity of the purified phage endolysin towards lyophilized Micrococcus luteus cells was 1/11 of the activity of chicken egg white lysozymes, the endolysin showed stronger antibacterial activity towards E. coli W3110, E. coli JM109(DE3) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 than chicken egg white lysozymes. The antibacterial activity of the endolysin towards these three bacterial strains was marked when EDTA was added to the endolysin solution.
TI  - Ixodidin, a novel antimicrobial peptide from the hemocytes of the cattle tick Boophilus microplus with inhibitory activity against serine proteinases.
AB  - The presence of an effective immune response in the hemocoel of arthropods is essential for survival as it prevents the invasion of pathogens throughout the animal body. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) play an important role in this response by rapidly killing invading microorganisms. In this study, a novel cysteine-rich AMP has been isolated and characterized from the hemocytes of the cattle tick, Boophilus microplus. In addition to growth inhibition of Escherichia coli and Micrococcus luteus, the newly described AMP, designated ixodidin (derived from the Family Ixodidae), was found to exert proteolytic inhibitory activity against two exogenous serine proteinases, elastase and chymotrypsin. This is the first report of a molecule of an arachnid that has been shown to inhibit bacterial growth and proteinase activity.
TI  - The molecular basis for the mode of action of bicyclomycin.
AB  - Bicyclomycin (1) is a clinically useful antibiotic exhibiting activity against a  broad spectrum of Gram-negative bacteria and against the Gram-positive bacterium, Micrococcus luteus. Bicyclomycin has been used to treat diarrhea in humans and bacterial diarrhea in calves and pigs and is marketed by Fujisawa (Osaka, Japan) under the trade name Bicozamycin. The structure of 1 is unique among antibiotics, and our studies document that its mechanism of action is novel. Early mechanistic proposals suggested that 1 reacted with nucleophiles (e.g., a protein sulfhydryl group) necessary for the remodeling the peptidoglycan assembly within the bacterial cell wall. We, however, showed that 1 targeted the rho transcription termination factor in Escherichia coli. The rho protein is integral to the expression of many gene products in E. coli and other Gram-negative bacteria, and without rho the cell losses viability. Rho is a member of the RecA-type ATPase class of enzymes that use nucleotide contacts to couple oligonucleotide translocation to ATP hydrolysis. Bicyclomycin is the only known selective inhibitor of rho. In this article, we integrate the evidence obtained from bicyclomycin structure-activity studies, site-directed mutagenesis investigations, bicyclomycin affinity labels, and biochemical and biophysical measurements with recent X-ray crystallographic images of the bicyclomycin-rho complex to define the rho antibiotic binding site and to document the pathway for rho inhibition by 1. Together, the structural and functional studies demonstrate how 1, a modest rho inhibitor, can disrupt the rho molecular machinery thereby leading to a catastrophic effect caused by the untimely overproduction of proteins not normally expressed constitutively, thus leading to a toxic effect on the cells.
TI  - Meroterpenes from the ascidian Aplidium aff. densum.
AB  - Chemical investigation of the ascidian Aplidium aff. densum collected at Masirah  Island, Oman, has resulted in the isolation of five meroterpenes: two new ones, methoxyconidiol (1) and didehydroconicol (2), and three related, known compounds, 3-5. The structures of 1 and 2 were determined by a combination of mass spectrometry and one- and two-dimensional high-field NMR techniques. Their biological activities against bacteria and human lymphoblastic cell lines were evaluated.
TI  - Purification and cDNA cloning of a cecropin from the longicorn beetle, Acalolepta luxuriosa.
AB  - We have cloned and characterized a novel antibacterial peptide from the hemolymph of the coleopteran insect Acalolepta luxuriosa, of the superfamily Cerambyocidea. This peptide is active against Micrococcus luteus and Escherichia coli, and the amino acid sequence deduced by cloning of the cDNA identifies it as a coleopteran cecropin. Sequence comparisons and phylogenetic analyses performed using Clustal X suggest that this cecropin is evolutionarily intermediate between dipteran and lepidopteran cecropins. The results of MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry indicate that the mature form of this antibacterial peptide is 35 amino acid residues in length and has an amidated C-terminal isoleucine. This report is the first description of a cecropin from a coleopteran insect.
TI  - Recombinant bacterial expression of the lysozyme from the tobacco-hornworm Manduca sexta with activity at low temperatures.
AB  - A gene coding for lysozyme from the insect Manduca sexta (Ms-lyz) was expressed in Escherichia coli. The protein was produced as an insoluble cytoplasmic inclusion body which was denatured in 8 M: guanidine-HCl, renatured and purified by affinity and ion-exchange chromatography. The N-terminal sequence and the activity of the recombinant protein against Micrococcus luteus confirmed that correct expression had occurred. When Ms-lyz activity was compared to hen egg white lysozyme, the insect lysozyme was active at lower temperatures. These results demonstrate the feasibility of producing a disulfide-bonded lysozyme enzyme in bacteria and suggest that the insect Ms-lyz is an interesting system for further development of an antibacterial functional at low temperatures.
TI  - Host blood proteins and peptides in the midgut of the tick Dermacentor variabilis contribute to bacterial control.
AB  - Antimicrobial midgut proteins and peptides that result from blood digestion in feeding American dog ticks Dermacentor variabilis (Say) were identified. Midgut extracts from these ticks showed antimicrobial activity against Micrococcus luteus, regardless of whether they were challenged with peptidoglycan, blood meal components, rabbit blood, Bacillus subtilis, Escherischia coli or Borrelia burgdorferi. However, no peptide band co-migrating with defensin was found in midgut extracts from the challenged ticks. Partial purification of the midgut extracts using C(18) Sep Paks and gel electrophoresis showed the presence of 4 distinct bands with rMW 4.1, 5.3, 5.7 and 8.0 kDa identified by tryptic digestion-mass fingerprinting as digestive fragments of rabbit alpha-, beta-, gamma-chain hemoglobin, and rabbit ubiquitin. No evidence of varisin, a defensin previously identified in the hemolymph of D. variabilis, was found in the tryptic digest, although varisin was found in a hemocyte lysate using the same methods. However, varisin transcript was detected in midgut cell lysates. Also present in all midgut samples was a cluster of 3 overlapping bands with rMW 13.0, 14.1 and 14.7 kDa which were identified by tryptic-digestion LC-MS and MALDI-TOF as rabbit alpha- and beta-chain hemoglobin (undigested) and transtherytin. Lysozyme transcript was detected in midgut cell extracts but the peptide was not. Studies done on other tick species demonstrated that hemoglobin digestion resulted in antimicrobial fragments. Antimicrobial hemoglobin fragments (including fragments larger than any reported previously) also were found in D. variabilis, as well as ubiquitin, a peptide known to occur as part of an antimicrobial complex in vertebrate leukocytes. In addition, we noted that Borrelia burgdorferi spirochetes were not lysed in the midgut lumen, which would be expected if defensin and lysozyme were active in this location. In this respect, the midgut's response to microbial challenge differs from that of the hemolymph. In summary, the midgut's antimicrobial activity appears to be primarily a byproduct of hemoglobin digestion rather than expression of immune peptides and proteins.
TI  - A study on inhibitory effects of Sigla tree (Liquidambar orientalis Mill. var. orientalis) storax against several bacteria.
AB  - In this study, Sigla (Liquidambar orientalis Mill.) storax (styrax) was investigated for antibacterial activity against Aeromonas hydrophila, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, B. brevis, B. cereus, B. megaterium, B. subtilis, Corynebacterium xerosis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, E. coli O157:H7, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Listeria monocytogenes, Micrococcus luteus, Mycobacterium smegmatis, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. fluorescens, Staphylococcus aureus and Yersinia enterocolitica. The storax was dissolved in absolute ethanol and was tested at concentrations of 10.0%, 1.0%, 0.4%, 0.2% and 0.1%. Pure ethanol was used for the control. The antibacterial activity of the Sigla storax was determined by using the agar diffusion method. The growths of A. hydrophila, B. amyloliquefaciens, B. megaterium, E. coli, E. coli O157:H7, L. monocytogenes and Y. enterocolitica were not inhibited by any of the concentrations of Sigla storax. The results showed that Sigla storax has antibacterial activity against many bacteria at concentrations of 10.0% and against some bacteria at concentrations of 1.0%, 0.4% and 0.2%.
TI  - Characterization of salt-tolerant glutaminase from Stenotrophomonas maltophilia NYW-81 and its application in Japanese soy sauce fermentation.
AB  - Glutaminase from Stenotrophomonas maltophilia NYW-81 was purified to homogeneity  with a final specific activity of 325 U/mg. The molecular mass of the native enzyme was estimated to be 41 kDa by gel filtration. A subunit molecular mass of 36 kDa was measured with SDS-PAGE, thus indicating that the native enzyme is a monomer. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the enzyme was determined to be KEAETQQKLANVVILATGGTIA. Besides L: -glutamine, which was hydrolyzed with the highest specific activity (100%), L: -asparagine (74%), D: -glutamine (75%), and D: -asparagine (67%) were also hydrolyzed. The pH and temperature optima were 9.0 and approximately 60 degrees C, respectively. The enzyme was most stable at pH 8.0 and was highly stable (relative activities from 60 to 80%) over a wide pH range (5.0-10.0). About 70 and 50% of enzyme activity was retained even after treatment at 60 and 70 degrees C, respectively, for 10 min. The enzyme showed high activity (86% of the original activity) in the presence of 16% NaCl. These results indicate that this enzyme has a higher salt tolerance and thermal stability than bacterial glutaminases that have been reported so far. In a model reaction of Japanese soy sauce fermentation, glutaminase from S. maltophilia exhibited high ability in the production of glutamic acid compared with glutaminases from Aspergillus oryzae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas citronellolis, and Micrococcus luteus, indicating that this enzyme is suitable for application in Japanese soy sauce fermentation.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of Fill Canal, Sealapex, Mineral Trioxide Aggregate, Portland cement and EndoRez.
AB  - AIM: To determine in vitro the antimicrobial activity of Fill Canal, Sealapex, Mineral Trioxide Aggregate (MTA), Portland cement and EndoRez on various species of microorganisms. METHODOLOGY: The diffusion method on Muller-Hinton agar (MH) was employed. A base layer was made using MH agar and five wells were made by removing agar at equidistant points. Sealers were placed into the wells immediately after manipulation. The microorganisms Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Micrococcus luteus ATCC 9341, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 and Candida albicans ATCC 10231 were seeded by pour plate. The plates were kept at room temperature for 2 h for prediffusion and then incubated at 37 degrees C for 24 h. Aliquots of 10 mL of 0.05% triphenyltetrazolium chloride gel were added for optimization and the zones of inhibition were measured. RESULTS: Sealapex and Fill Canal demonstrated antimicrobial activity for all strains. For MTA and Portland cement, only E. coli was not inhibited. No antimicrobial activity was detected for EndoRez. CONCLUSIONS: In this laboratory study, Fill Canal, Sealapex, MTA and Portland cement presented antimicrobial activity whilst EndoRez did not.
TI  - Mosquito phenoloxidase and defensin colocalize in melanization innate immune responses.
AB  - Mosquitoes mount strong humoral and cellular immune responses against foreign organisms. Two components of the mosquito immune response that have received much attention are the phenoloxidase cascade that leads to melanization and antimicrobial peptides. The purpose of the current study was to use immunocytochemistry and transmission electron microscopy to identify the location of the melanization rate-limiting enzyme phenoloxidase and the antimicrobial peptide defensin in innate immune reactions against Escherichia coli and Micrococcus luteus by the mosquito Aedes aegypti. Our results show that both phenoloxidase and defensin are present at the sites of melanin biosynthesis in immune reactions against bacteria. Furthermore, both proteins are often present inside the same melanotic capsules. When hemocytes were analyzed, phenoloxidase was present in the cytosol of oenocytoids, but no significant amounts of defensin were detected inside any hemocytes. In summary, these data show that phenoloxidase and defensin colocalize in melanization reactions against bacteria and argue for further studies into the potential role of defensin in phenoloxidase-based melanization innate immune responses in mosquitoes.
TI  - Correlation between the activities of alpha-helical antimicrobial peptides and hydrophobicities represented as RP HPLC retention times.
AB  - PTP7 is a 13-amino acid residue peptide designed from gaegurin 6, an antimicrobial peptide isolated from skin secretions of Rana rugosa. In order to examine the effect of hydrophobicity on antimicrobial activity, a series of PTP7 derivatives were constructed and analyzed the activity against bacteria and artificial membrane. We found that the mean hydrophobicity by simple summation of hydrophobicity of each constituent amino acid did not necessarily describe the hydrophobic property of antimicrobial peptides. The mean hydrophobicity did not show close correlation with the observed hydrophobicity by measuring reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP HPLC) retention time. The observed hydrophobicity represented as RP HPLC retention time correlated well with the activity against artificial membrane and Gram positive bacterial species, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Micrococcus luteus, rather than mean hydrophobicity. However, antimicrobial activity against Gram negative bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, did not show correlation with RP HPLC retention time. These data indicate that the RP HPLC retention time should be exploited rather than the mean hydrophobicity in the analysis of the relationship between hydrophobicity and antimicrobial activity.
TI  - Chemical compositions and antimicrobial activities of four different Anatolian propolis samples.
AB  - Propolis means a gum that is gathered by bees from various plants. It is known for its biological properties, having antibacterial, antifungal and healing properties. The aims of this study were to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of four different Anatolian propolis samples on different groups of microorganisms including some oral pathogens and comparison between their chemical compositions. Ethanol extracts of propolis (EEP) were prepared from four different Anatolian propolis samples and examined whether EEP inhibit the growth of the test microorganisms or not. For the antimicrobial activity assays, minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were determined by using macrodilution method. The MIC values of the most effective propolis (TB) were 2 microg/ml for Streptococcus sobrinus and Enterococcus faecalis, 4 microg/ml for Micrococcus luteus, Candida albicans and C. krusei, 8 microg/ml for Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterobacter aerogenes, 16 microg/ml for Escherichia coli and C. tropicalis and 32 microg/ml for Salmonella typhimurium and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The chemical compositions of EEP's were determined by high-temperature high-resolution gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. The main compounds of four Anatolian propolis samples were flavonoids such as pinocembrin, pinostropin, isalpinin, pinobanksin, quercetin, naringenin, galangine and chrysin. Although propolis samples were collected from different regions of Anatolia all showed significant antimicrobial activity against the Gram positive bacteria and yeasts. Propolis can prevent dental caries since it demonstrated significant antimicrobial activity against the microorganisms such as Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus and C. albicans, which involves in oral diseases.
TI  - Antibacterial screening of anthocyanic and proanthocyanic fractions from cranberry juice.
AB  - The effect of anthocyanin- and proanthocyanidin-rich fractions isolated from cranberry juice was studied for their antibacterial activity against nine bacterial strains. Activity was assessed by the agar diffusion assay. Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538 was the only strain to exhibit some susceptibility to four out of 10 anthocyanin-rich fractions tested. A variable susceptibility of S. aureus, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 10541, and Micrococcus luteus ATCC 9341 to proanthocyanidin- rich fractions was also observed. Streptococcus mutans strains as well as Escherichia coli ATCC 10538 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 were not susceptible to any of the cranberry juice samples or fractions at the tested concentrations. There was no clear correlation between Gram-positive or Gram-negative bacterial susceptibility to cranberry juice. In this work, the role of cranberry juice anthocyanic and proanthocyanic fractions upon bacterial viability is discussed.
TI  - New antibacterial peptide derived from bovine hemoglobin.
AB  - Peptic digestion of bovine hemoglobin at low degree of hydrolysis yields an intermediate peptide fraction exhibiting antibacterial activity against Micrococcus luteus A270, Listeria innocua, Escherichia coli and Salmonella enteritidis after separation by reversed-phase HPLC. From this fraction a pure peptide was isolated and analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) and electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS). This peptide correspond to the 107-136 fragment of the alpha chain of bovine hemoglobin. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) towards the four strains and its hemolytic activity towards bovine erythrocytes were determined. A MIC of 38 microM was reported against L. innocua and 76 microM for other various bacterial species. This peptide had no hemolytic activity up to 380 microM concentration.
TI  - Murein-hydrolyzing activity of flagellin FlaA of Listeria monocytogenes.
AB  - In this preliminary report we show that a 29 kDa surface protein of Listeria monocytogenes EGD removed from cells with 4 M LiCl has peptidoglycan (murein) hydrolyzing activity, as revealed by zymographic analysis using Bacillus subtilis murein and heat-killed Micrococcus luteus cells casted in the gel. Following two-dimensional electrophoresis, the protein was electroblotted to PVDF membrane and its identity (FlaA) was revealed by sequencing. Peptidoglycan hydrolysing activity of FlaA purified by FPLC on Mono-S Sepharose against labelled Escherichia coli murein was demonstrated.
TI  - Aging of the innate immune response in Drosophila melanogaster.
AB  - Increased activation of the innate immune system is a common feature of aging animals, including mammals and Drosophila melanogaster. With age, D. melanogaster progressively express higher levels of many antimicrobial peptides. It is unknown, however, whether this pattern reflects age-dependent changes in the function of the immune system itself or arises simply because aged adults have greater cumulative exposure to pathogens. Here we demonstrate that aged D. melanogaster transcribe more antimicrobial diptericin when experimentally exposed to septic bacterial infections. This strong net response in older females is the result of persistent diptericin transcription upon septic exposure, whereas young females rapidly terminate this induction. In contrast to their response to septic exposure, when exposed to killed bacteria aged females have less capacity to induce diptericin. Because this functional capacity of innate immunity declines with age, we conclude that female Drosophila undergo immune senescence. Furthermore, we show that fecundity is reduced by induction of innate immunity via the immune deficiency pathway. Consequently, maximum reproduction will occur when the immune response is tightly controlled in young females, even if this increases infection risk at later ages.
TI  - Synthesis of some 1-[(N, N-disubstituted thiocar bamoylthio)acetyl]-3-(2-thienyl)-5-aryl-2-pyrazoline derivatives and investigation of their antibacterial and antifungal activities.
AB  - Fourteen new 1-[(N, N-disubstituted thiocarbamoylthio)acetyl]-3-(2-thienyl)-5-aryl-2-pyrazoline derivatives (7a-n) were synthesised by reacting 1-(chloroacetyl)-3-(2-thienyl)-5-aryl-2-pyrazolines (5a-g) and appropriate sodium salts of N, N-disubstituted dithiocarbamoic acids (6a, b). The structures of the synthesised compounds were confirmed by elemental analyses, UV, IR, (1)H-NMR and FAB(+)-MS spectral data. Their antibacterial activities against Proteus vulgaris (NRRL B-123), Escherichia coli (NRRL B-3704), Aeromonas hydrophila (Ankara University, Faculty of Veterinary Sciences), Salmonella typhimurium (NRRL B-4420), Streptococcus feacalis (NRRL B-14617), Micrococcus luteus (NRLL B-4375) were investigated and in this investigation, a significant level of activity was illustrated. Antifungal activities of the compounds against Candida albicans and Candida globrata (isolates obtained from Osmangazi Uni. Fac. of Medicine) were found to be inactive. Compounds 7c-n were also evaluated for antituberculosis activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H(37)Rv using the BACTEC 460 radiometric system and BACTEC 12B medium. The preliminary results indicated that all of the tested compounds were inactive against the test organism.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of an eudesmane sesquiterpene isolated from common Varthemia, Varthemia iphionoides.
AB  - The ethyl acetate extract of the whole aerial parts of Varthemia iphionoides (Compositae) showed a pronounced antibacterial activity. The bioassay-guided fractionation of the ethyl acetate extract and further purification of the most antibacterially active fraction led to the isolation and identification of an antibacterial sesquiterpene, selina-4,11(13)-dien-3-on-12-oic acid. This compound exhibited potent antimicrobial activity against six bacterial species (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus and Salmonella enteritides). The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of this compound which was determined by the agar dilution method ranged between 250 and 500 microg/ml.
TI  - Synthesis of Schiff bases of 4-(4-aminophenyl)-morpholine as potential antimicrobial agents.
AB  - In the present study, a novel series of Schiff bases of 4-(4-aminophenyl)-morpholine were synthesised and characterised by IR, 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, Mass spectral and elemental analysis. The compounds were screened for antibacterial (Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 9144), Staphylococcus epidermidis (ATCC 155), Bacillus cereus (ATCC 11778), Micrococcus luteus (ATCC 4678), and Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922)) and antifungal (Candida albicans (ATCC 2091) and Aspergillus niger (ATCC 9029)) activities. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of the compounds were also ascertained by agar streak dilution method. 4-(4-(4-Hydroxy-benzylidene-imino)phenyl)-morpholine (7) was found to be the most potent antimicrobial activity with MIC of 25, 19, 21, 16, 29, 20 and 40 microg/ml against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, B. cereus, M. luteus, E. coli, C. albicans and A. niger, respectively. All the other compounds exhibited moderate activity against the bacterial and fungal organisms tested.
TI  - Identification of a novel peptidoglycan hydrolase CwlM in Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
AB  - Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a major global pathogen whose threat has increased  with the emergence of multidrug-resistant strains. The cell wall of M. tuberculosis is thick, rigid, and hydrophobic, which serves to protect the organism from the environment and makes it highly impermeable to conventional antimicrobial agents. There is little known about cell wall autolysins (also referred to as peptidoglycan hydrolases) of mycobacteria. We identified an open reading frame (Rv3915) in the M. tuberculosis genome designated cwlM that appeared consistent with a peptidoglycan hydrolase. The 1218-bp gene was amplified by PCR, cloned and expressed in E. coli strain HMS174(DE-3), and its gene product, a 47-kDa recombinant protein, was purified and partially characterized. Purified CwlM was able to lyse whole mycobacteria, release peptidoglycan from the cell wall of Micrococcus luteus and Mycobacterium smegmatis, and cleave N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanyl-D-isoglutamine, releasing free N-acetylmuramic acid. These results indicate that CwlM is a novel autolysin and identify cwlM as the first, to our knowledge, autolysin gene identified and cloned from M. tuberculosis. CwlM offers a new target for a unique class of drugs that could alter the permeability of the mycobacterial cell wall and enhance the effectiveness of treatments for tuberculosis.
TI  - New insights into Drosophila larval haemocyte functions through genome-wide analysis.
AB  - Drosophila blood cells or haemocytes comprise three cell lineages, plasmatocytes, crystal cells and lamellocytes, involved in immune functions such as phagocytosis, melanisation and encapsulation. Transcriptional profiling of activities of distinct haemocyte populations and from naive or infected larvae, was performed to find genes contributing to haemocyte functions. Of the 13 000 genes represented on the microarray, over 2500 exhibited significantly enriched transcription in haemocytes. Among these were genes encoding integrins, peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRPs), scavenger receptors, lectins, cell adhesion molecules and serine proteases. One relevant outcome of this analysis was the gain of new insights into the lamellocyte encapsulation process. We showed that lamellocytes require betaPS integrin for encapsulation and that they transcribe one prophenoloxidase gene enabling them to produce the enzyme necessary for melanisation of the capsule. A second compelling observation was that following infection, the gene encoding the cytokine Spatzle was uniquely upregulated in haemocytes and not the fat body. This shows that Drosophila haemocytes produce a signal molecule ready to be activated through cleavage after pathogen recognition, informing distant tissues of infection.
TI  - Mosquito innate immunity: involvement of beta 1,3-glucan recognition protein in melanotic encapsulation immune responses in Armigeres subalbatus.
AB  - Beta 1,3-glucan recognition proteins (GRP) have specific affinity for beta 1,3-glucan, a component on the surface of fungi and bacteria. By interacting with beta 1,3-glucan, GRP initiates activation of prophenoloxidase, a key enzyme in the signaling pathway leading to melanotic encapsulation in invertebrates. In this study, we characterize a novel hemocyte-specific GRP from the mosquito, Armigeres subalbatus (AsGRP). The 1.57 kb cDNA clone encodes a 499 deduced amino acid sequence, which contains a region that displays significant similarity to the glucanase-like regions of other GRPs and Gram-negative bacteria binding proteins found in other organisms. AsGRP is constitutively expressed in the hemolymph of adult female mosquitoes, and is upregulated following challenge with Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, and the filarial worm Dirofilaria immitis. AsGRP specifically recognizes curdlan (insoluble beta 1,3-glucan), but not mannose or N-acetyl-D-glucosamine. AsGRP binds a low percentage of E. coli, most M. luteus and D. immitis microfilariae. AsGRP double-stranded RNA interference strongly inhibits melanotic encapsulation of D. immitis in Ar. subalbatus. These results suggest that AsGRP has the capacity to bind to a variety of pathogens, functions as a pattern recognition receptor, and is required for effective melanotic encapsulation immune responses in Ar. subalbatus.
TI  - Synthesis and study of antibacterial and antifungal activities of novel 2-[[(benzoxazole/benzimidazole-2-yl)sulfanyl] acetylamino]thiazoles.
AB  - Several 2-[[(benzoxazole/benzimidazole-2-yl)sulfanyl]acetylamino]thiazoles derivatives were synthesized by reacting 4-substituted-2-(chloroacetylamino)thiazoles with benzoxazole/benzimidazole-2-thioles in acetone and in the presence of K2CO3. The chemical structures of the compounds were elucidated by IR, 1H-NMR, and FAB(+)-MS spectral data. Their antimicrobial activities against Micrococcus luteus (NRLL B-4375), Bacillus cereus (NRRL B-3711), Proteus vulgaris (NRRL B-123), Salmonella typhimurium (NRRL B-4420), Staphylococcus aureus (NRRL B-767), Escherichia coli (NRRL B-3704), Candida albicans and Candida globrata (isolates obtained from Osmangazi Uni. Fac.of Medicine) were investigated and in this investigation, a significant level of activity was illustrated.
TI  - Molecular cloning, overexpression, and purification of Micrococcus luteus K-3-type glutaminase from Aspergillus oryzae RIB40.
AB  - We have for the first time found and cloned the cDNA (AoglsA) of Aspergillus oryzae RIB40, which encodes a 49.9-kDa protein sharing 40% homology with the salt-tolerant glutaminase of Micrococcus luteus K-3 (Micrococcus glutaminase). AoglsA was subcloned into a series of expression vectors and expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Escherichia coli. The gene product, which we named AoGls, showed glutaminase activity and was produced in a cell wall fraction of S. cerevisiae and a soluble protein in E. coli. The highest expression level of 186 U/mg was obtained when the AoglsA was inserted into six bases downstream of the Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence of pKK223-3 and expressed in E. coli Rosetta (DE3). AoGls was purified by SuperQ-TOYOPEARL, glutamine affinity chromatography, and Butyl-TOYOPEARL. This is the first report on the overexpression and purification of a M. luteus K-3-type glutaminase cloned from an eucaryote.
TI  - [Interaction of neomycin with other antibiotics on selected bacterial strains].
AB  - Antimicrobial combinations are used most frequently to provide broad-spectrum empirical coverage in the treatment of bacterial infections. However, combination of two antibiotics may not influence their activity, may lead to synergy or antagonism in the activity. Neomycin may be combined with one of the following antibiotics: ampicillin, procaine penicillin, gramicidin, bacitracin, polymyxin B, lincomycin, oxytetracycline, and erythromycin in some human and veterinary multiantibiotic drugs distributed in Poland. The checkerboard method has been one of the traditional assays for the measurement of antibiotic interactions. The aim of this study was to analyse the activity interaction of neomycin with second antibiotic in multiantibiotic drugs distributed in Poland on standards and clinical bacterial strains. Checkerboard results for all strains demonstrated synergism for 2.5% of combinations, only for standards strains. In one case Salmonella Enteritidis, in combination of neomycin with bacitracin, inhibition effect was observed. Additive effects were predominant--49%. In 18% neutral effects were shown, but in 26% of combinations FIC indexes were not possible to calculate, because of the resistance of clinical strains to the highest concentration of at least one antibiotic. In combination of aminoglycoside (neomycin) with beta-lactams antibiotics (ampicillin, procaine penicillin) in vitro, no synergy was observed for all examined strains. The best results were achieved for combinations of neomycin with peptide antibiotics (polymyxin, gramicidin and bacitracin)--5 for all 6 synergy effect observed.
TI  - Cyclic dipeptides exhibit synergistic, broad spectrum antimicrobial effects and have anti-mutagenic properties.
AB  - Cyclic dipeptides are known to have antiviral, antibiotic and antitumour properties. The aim of this study was to determine the combined effects of cyclo(L-leucyl-L-prolyl) and cyclo(L-phenylalanyl-L-prolyl) on the growth of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and pathogenic yeasts, as well as determining their anti-mutagenic effects. This drug combination was especially effective against five VRE strains: Enterococcus faecium (K-99-38), E. faecalis (K-99-17), E. faecalis (K-99-258), E. faecium (K-01-312) and E. faecalis (K-01-511) with MIC values of 0.25-1 mg/l. It was also effective against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Micrococcus luteus, Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans with MIC values of 0.25-0.5 mg/l. In addition, the cyclic dipeptides exerted anti-mutagenic activity against Salmonella typhimurium TA98 and TA100 strains in a Salmonella mutation assay. The number of mutant colonies of S. typhimurium strains TA98 and TA100 induced by exposure to AF-2 (0.2 microg/plate) decreased in a concentration-dependent manner in the presence of the two cyclic dipeptides (correlation 0.72 and 0.78, respectively). Here, for the first time, we report synergistic effects of the cyclic dipeptides [cyclo(L-leu-L-pro) and cyclo(L-phe-L-pro)] in inhibiting the growth of pathogenic microorganisms, as well as their anti-mutagenic effects in Salmonella strains.
TI  - Multilayer polyelectrolyte films functionalized by insertion of defensin: a new approach to protection of implants from bacterial colonization.
AB  - Infection of implanted materials by bacteria constitutes one of the most serious  complications following prosthetic surgery. In the present study, we developed a new strategy based on the insertion of an antimicrobial peptide (defensin from Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes) into polyelectrolyte multilayer films built by the alternate deposition of polyanions and polycations. Quartz crystal microbalance and streaming potential measurements were used to follow step by step the construction of the multilayer films and embedding of the defensin within the films. Antimicrobial assays were performed with two strains: Micrococcus luteus (a gram-positive bacterium) and Escherichia coli D22 (a gram-negative bacterium). The inhibition of E. coli D22 growth at the surface of defensin-functionalized films was found to be 98% when 10 antimicrobial peptide layers were inserted in the film architecture. Noticeably, the biofunctionalization could be achieved only when positively charged poly(l-lysine) was the outermost layer of the film. On the basis of the results of bacterial adhesion experiments observed by confocal or electron microscopy, these observations could result from the close interaction of the bacteria with the positively charged ends of the films, which allows defensin to interact with the bacterial membrane structure. These results open new possibilities for the use of such easily built and functionalized architectures onto any type of implantable biomaterial. The modified surfaces are active against microbial infection and represent a novel means of local host protection.
TI  - Microfabricated differential mobility spectrometry with pyrolysis gas chromatography for chemical characterization of bacteria.
AB  - A microfabricated drift tube for differential mobility spectrometry (DMS) was used with pyrolysis-gas chromatography (py-GC) to chemically characterize bacteria through three-dimensional plots of ion intensity, compensation voltage from differential mobility spectra, and chromatographic retention time. The DMS analyzer provided chemical information for positive and negative ions simultaneously from chemical reactions between pyrolysis products in the GC effluent and reactant ions of H+(H2O)n and O2-(H2O)n in air at ambient pressure. Authentic standards for chemicals formed in the pyrolysis of bacteria showed favorable matches with plots from py-GC/DMS analysis and were supported by py-GC/MS results. These and other yet-unidentified constituents provided a means to distinguish Escherichia coli from Micrococcus luteus. A Gram-positive spore former (Bacillus megaterium) was distinguished by an abundant peak for crotonic acid evident in positive and negative ions and not observed with M. luteus. In contrast, plots from py-GC/DMS of lipid A and lipoteichoic acid showed poor matches to plots for a Gram-negative (E. coli) bacterium and a Gram-positive (M. luteus) bacterium and the differences were attributed to differences in genus sources of the biopolymers. A significant percentage of the chemical information available in py-GC/DMS is unidentified, and the analytical utility must be established. Precision in the chemical measurement was determined as +/- 0.2 V, 10% relative standard deviation (RSD), and +/- 0.05 min for compensation voltage, peak intensity, and retention time, respectively. The minimum number of total bacteria (cell forming units) detected was 6000 though detection limits and resolution could be varied by the magnitude of the separation voltage in the differential mobility spectrometer.
TI  - Plasmodium berghei ookinetes induce nitric oxide production in Anopheles pseudopunctipennis midguts cultured in vitro.
AB  - The Anopheles pseudopunctipennis nitric oxide synthase gene (ApNOS) was identified and its partial sequence showed high homology with NOS from A. stephensi, A. gambiae (putative sequence), and Drosophila melanogaster. ApNOS was mainly expressed in male and female adult mosquitoes and was induced by a blood meal. Nitric oxide (NO) was produced by in vitro-cultured mosquito midguts inoculated by enema with Plasmodium berghei ookinetes, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Gram-positive bacteria (Micrococcus luteus), but not with Gram-negative bacteria (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli or Serratia marcescens). Dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) oxidation induced the generation of NO in midguts in vitro, and hydrogen peroxide generated during its oxidation induced ApNOS expression. P. berghei ookinetes exposed in vitro to L-DOPA and sodium nitroprusside (a NO generator) were killed. These observations demonstrate that reactive oxygen and nitrogen intermediates constitute a part of the cytotoxic arsenal employed by Anopheles mosquitoes against microbial pathogens and Plasmodium ookinetes.
TI  - Nagelamides A-H, new dimeric bromopyrrole alkaloids from marine sponge Agelas species.
AB  - Eight new dimeric bromopyrrole alkaloids, nagelamides A-H (1-8) and a monomeric one, 9,10-dihydrokeramadine (9), have been isolated from the Okinawan marine sponge Agelas sp., and the structures were elucidated from spectroscopic data. Nagelamides A-H (1-8) exhibited antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria. Nagelamide G (7) inhibited protein phosphatase 2A activity.
TI  - Evaluation of antibacterial properties of some medicinal plants used in Iran.
AB  - Forty-five species of 29 plant families used in the traditional medicine by Iranian people, showed antibacterial activities against one or more of the bacterial species: Bacillus cereus, Bacillus pumilus, Bordetella bronchiseptica, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Micrococcus luteus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. No plant showed activity against Serratia marcescens; Bordetella bronchiseptica being the most susceptible species. All extracts showed the same activity 18 months later.
TI  - A novel lectin with a fibrinogen-like domain and its potential involvement in the innate immune response of Armigeres subalbatus against bacteria.
AB  - Mosquitoes have an efficient cellular innate immune response that includes phagocytosis of microbial pathogens and encapsulation of metozoan parasites. In this study, we describe a novel lectin in the mosquito, Armigeres subalbatus (aslectin or AL-1). The 1.27 kb cDNA clone for the AL-1 gene (AL-1) encodes a 279 deduced amino acid sequence that contains a C-terminal fibrinogen-like domain. AL-1 is transcribed in all life stages. AL-1 mainly exists in the haemolymph of adult female mosquitoes, and is upregulated following both Escherichia coli and Micrococcus luteus challenge. AL-1 specifically recognizes N-acetyl-d-glucosamine and is able to bind both E. coli and M. luteus. These results suggest that AL-1 might function as a pattern recognition receptor in the immune response in Ar. subalbatus.
TI  - Resistance of rumen bacteria murein to bovine gastric lysozyme.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lysozymes, enzymes mostly associated with defence against bacterial infections, are mureinolytic. Ruminants have evolved a gastric c type lysozyme as a digestive enzyme, and profit from digestion of foregut bacteria, after most dietary components, including protein, have been fermented in the rumen. In this work we characterized the biological activities of bovine gastric secretions against membranes, purified murein and bacteria. RESULTS: Bovine gastric extract (BGE) was active against both G+ and G- bacteria, but the effect against Gram- bacteria was not due to the lysozyme, since purified BGL had only activity against Gram+ bacteria. We were unable to find small pore forming peptides in the BGE, and found that the inhibition of Gram negative bacteria by BGE was due to an artefact caused by acetate. We report for first time the activity of bovine gastric lysozyme (BG lysozyme) against pure bacterial cultures, and the specific resistance of some rumen Gram positive strains to BGL. CONCLUSIONS: Some Gram+ rumen bacteria showed resistance to abomasum lysozyme. We discuss the implications of this finding in the light of possible practical applications of such a stable antimicrobial peptide.
TI  - Transcriptomic analysis in the leech Theromyzon tessulatum: involvement of cystatin B in innate immunity.
AB  - At the present time, there is little information on mechanisms of innate immunity in invertebrate groups other than insects, especially annelids. In the present study, we have performed a transcriptomic study of the immune response in the leech Theromyzon tessulatum after bacterial challenge, by a combination of differential display RT (reverse transcriptase)-PCR and cDNA microarrays. The results show relevant modulations concerning several known and unknown genes. Indeed, threonine deaminase, malate dehydrogenase, cystatin B, polyadenylate-binding protein and alpha-tubulin-like genes are up-regulated after immunostimulation. We focused on cystatin B (stefin B), which is an inhibitor of cysteine proteinases involved in the vertebrate immune response. We have cloned the full-length cDNA and named the T. tessulatum gene as Tt-cysb. Main structural features of cystatins were identified in the derived amino acid sequence of Tt-cysb cDNA; namely, a glycine residue in the N-terminus and a consensus sequence of Gln-Xaa-Val-Xaa-Gly (QXVXG) corresponding to the catalytic site. Moreover, Tt-cysb is the first cystatin B gene characterized in invertebrates. We have determined by in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry that Tt-cysb is only expressed in large coelomic cells. In addition, this analysis confirmed that Tt-cysb is up-regulated after bacterial challenge, and that increased expression occurs only in coelomic cells. These data demonstrate that the innate immune response in the leech involves a cysteine proteinase inhibitor that is not found in ecdysozoan models, such as Drosophila melanogaster or Caenorhabditis elegans, and so underlines the great need for information about innate immunity mechanisms in different invertebrate groups.
TI  - Reassessing the role of defensin in the innate immune response of the mosquito, Aedes aegypti.
AB  - Defensin is the predominant inducible immune peptide in Aedes aegypti. In spite of its activity against Gram-positive bacteria in vitro, defensin expression is detected in mosquitoes inoculated with Gram-positive or negative bacteria, or with filarial worms. Defensin transcription and expression are dependent upon bacterial dose; however, translation is inconsistent with transcription because peptide is detectable only in mosquitoes inoculated with large doses. In vitro translation assays provide further evidence for post-transcriptional regulation of defensin. Clearance assays show that a majority of bacteria are cleared before defensin is detected. In gene silencing experiments, no significant difference in mortality was observed between defensin-deficient and control mosquitoes after bacteria inoculation. These studies suggest that defensin may have an alternative function in mosquito immunity.
TI  - Antibacterial screening of plants used in Iranian folkloric medicine.
AB  - Fifty methanolic plant extracts belonging to 44 plant species of 33 families finding use in Iranian folkloric medicine were screened for antibacterial activity. Thirty samples, including 28 species in 20 families, had antibacterial activity against at least on one of the bacteria. Among the active plants, 32.6% were active against G(-), 62% against G(+), and 47.3% against both G(-) and G(+) bacteria. Dianthus coryophyllus was active against all tested G(-) and G(+) bacteria except Micrococcus luteus. Most susceptible G(-) bacteria were Klebsiella pneumoniae and Bordetella bronchiseptica and least susceptible G(-) bacterium was Escherichia coli. In G(+) bacteria, most and least susceptible were Staphylococcus aureus and M. luteus, respectively. The least MIC, as 0.62 mg/ml, belonged to Myrtus communis seeds against S. aureus, Bacillus cereus and B. bronchiseptica, and to Terminalia chebula ripe seeds against S. aureus.
TI  - Beta-1,3-glucan recognition protein-2 (betaGRP-2)from Manduca sexta; an acute-phase protein that binds beta-1,3-glucan and lipoteichoic acid to aggregate fungi and bacteria and stimulate prophenoloxidase activation.
AB  - We have isolated and characterized a new beta-1,3-glucan recognition protein that is present in Manduca sexta cuticle and hemolymph. This 52 kDa protein, designated betaGRP-2, is 57% identical in sequence to betaGRP-1 from larval hymolymph of the same insect. BetaGRP-2 differs from betaGRP-1 in its absence of the naive larvae before the wandering stage begins. Transcription of the betaGRP-2 was up-regulated in larvae challenged with yeast or bacteria. BetaGRP-2 contains a region with sequence similarity to several glucanases but lacks glucanase activity. It aggregates yeasts and bacteria to, perhaps, limit the spread of invading cells and ensure a localized defense reaction. BetaGRP-2 binds laminarin and lipoteichoic acid, but not lipopolysaccharide. Laminarin-triggered prophenoloxidase activation was greatly enhanced in the induced larval hemolymph supplemented with purified betaGRP-2. Complementing other studies on pattern recognition molecules in M. sexta, these results indicate that a complex system of protein sensors is an integral component of the insect immune system and that different recognition molecules have overlapping binding specificity and functions.
TI  - Screening chemical composition and in vitro antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of the essential oils from Origanum syriacum L. growing in Turkey.
AB  - In the present study, essential oil from the leaves of Syrian oreganum [Origanum  syriacum L. (Lauraceae)] grown in Turkish state forests of the Dortyol district, Turkey, was obtained by steam distillation. The chemical composition of oil was analysed by GC and GC-MS, and was found to contain 49.02% monoterpenes, 36.60% oxygenated monoterpenes and 12.59% sesquiterpenes. The major components are as follows: gamma-terpinene, carvacrol, p-cymene and beta-caryophyllene. Subsequently, the reducing power, antioxidant and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical-scavenging activities of the essential oil were studied. The reducing power was compared with ascorbic acid, and the other activities were compared with 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methyl phenol (BHT, butylated hydroxytoluene). The results showed that the activities were concentration dependent. The antioxidant activities of the oil were slightly lower than those of ascorbic acid or BHT, so the oil can be considered an effective natural antioxidant. Antimicrobial activities of the essential oil from the leaves of Origanum syriacum was also determined on 16 microorganisms tested using the agar-disc diffusion method, and showed antimicrobial activity against 13 of these.
TI  - Synthesis of 6-fluoro-1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-quinoline-3-carboxylic acid derivatives as potential antimicrobial agents.
AB  - In the present study, a series of 1-ethyl/benzyl-6-fluoro-7-(substituted piperazin-1-yl)1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-quinoline-3-carboxylic acid were synthesized and characterized by IR, 1H-NMR, mass spectral and elemental analysis. The in vitro antibacterial and antifungal activities of the compounds were evaluated by paper disc diffusion method. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of the compounds were also determined by agar streak dilution method. The in vivo antibacterial activity of the compounds against Escherichia coli was also evaluated by mouse protection test. All the compounds exhibited significant antibacterial and weak antifungal activities. The in vivo antibacterial activity (ED50) against E. coli was 50-160 mg kg(-1) in the order of 7<9<8<10. 1-ethyl-6-fluoro-7-(2,5-dioxo-piperazin-1-yl)1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-quinoline-3-carbox ylic acid (7) was found to exhibit the most potent in vitro antimicrobial activity with MIC of 4.1, 3.1, 3.1, 2.4, 1, 1, 25 and >100 microg mL(-1) against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus cereus, E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Candida albicans and Aspergillus niger.
TI  - Proteomic analysis of the systemic immune response of Drosophila.
AB  - Improvements in two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, mass spectrometry, and bioinformatics provide new tools to characterize proteins involved in a physiological process, such as the immune response of the insect model Drosophila melanogaster. Profiling of the proteins present in the hemolymph (insect blood) of noninfected flies versus flies infected with bacteria or fungi was performed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, silver or Coomassie staining, and image analysis. Through this differential analysis, more than 70 out of 160 spots were up- or down-regulated by at least 5-fold after microbial infection. Coomassie staining, in-gel digestion, and database searches yielded the identity of a series of proteins that are directly involved in the Drosophila immune system. This included proteases, protease inhibitors, and recognition molecules such as prophenoloxydase-activating enzymes, serpins, and Gram-negative binding protein-like. Proteins with a potential function in the immune response were also identified, such as an odorant binding protein, peptidylglycine alpha-hydroxylating monooxygenase, and transferrin, affording new candidates for further investigation of innate immune mechanisms. Moreover, several molecules resulting from the cleavage of proteins were detected after the fungal infection. Altogether, this first differential proteomic analysis of the immune response of Drosophila paves the way for the study of proteins affected during innate immunity.
TI  - Culex pipiens pipiens: characterization of immune peptides and the influence of immune activation on development of Wuchereria bancrofti.
AB  - Stimulating or augmenting the innate immune response of insect vectors has been shown to impede or disrupt the development and transmission of eukaryotic pathogens; however, the majority of such studies have utilized model systems and not natural parasite-vector systems. The Culex pipiens complex of mosquitoes functions as a primary urban vector of Wuchereria bancrofti, a causative agent of lymphatic filariasis. To test the effects of immune activation on this vector-parasite interaction, Culex pipiens pipiens from the filariasis-endemic Nile Delta were subjected to bacteria inoculation and subsequently fed a blood meal containing W. bancrofti. No difference was seen between parasite development in these mosquitoes as compared to non-inoculated controls. A set of expressed sequence tags from blood-fed midgut and bacteria-inoculated Cx. p. pipiens reveals transcripts for the immune peptides cecropin, gambicin and defensin--all of which have been reported to have antiparasitic effects. Sequences and transcriptional profiles for these peptides are reported. The discrepancy between these results and those reported for the model parasite, Brugia malayi, in the mosquito Aedes aegypti are discussed.
TI  - Purification and cDNA cloning of a novel antibacterial peptide with a cysteine-stabilized alphabeta motif from the longicorn beetle, Acalolepta luxuriosa.
AB  - An antibacterial peptide from the hemolymph of a coleopteran insect, Acalolepta luxuriosa, in the superfamily Cerambyocidea was characterized. The mature antibacterial peptide had 27 amino acid residues with a theoretical molecular weight of 3099.29 and it showed antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli and Micrococcus luteus. The deduced amino acid sequence of the peptide showed that it had a cysteine-stabilized alphabeta motif with a C...CXXXC...C...CXC consensus sequence, like insect defensins. However, the results of a multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis with CLUSTAL X indicated that this peptide is a novel peptide with a cysteine-stabilized alphabeta motif that is distant from insect defensins.
TI  - Resuscitation factors from mycobacteria: homologs of Micrococcus luteus proteins.
AB  - SETTING: Resuscitation promoting factors (Rpfs) are proteins, originally identified in Micrococcus luteus, that promote recovery of bacteria from a viable but non-replicating phase (e.g., stationary phase or latency) to a replicating phase. Purified M. luteus Rpf can stimulate growth and increase recovery of M. luteus bacteria as well as Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacteria from prolonged stationary cultures. OBJECTIVE: To clone and characterize Rpfs from mycobacteria. DESIGN: We cloned one M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis rpf gene and one M. tuberculosis rpf gene into the pET19b or pET21a vector for expression in Escherichia coli. The His-tag recombinant proteins were purified and characterized. RESULTS: When the purified recombinant proteins were added to Sauton medium (a relatively minimal medium) at 100-500 pM, lag phase for mycobacteria from non-replicating cultures was shortened and there was a 10- to 100-fold increase in colony-forming units compared with control samples. In most probable number assays, the mycobacterial Rpfs increased recovery of mycobacteria from late stationary culture by about 10-fold. The Rpfs also promoted recovery of extensively washed Mycobacterium smegmatis bacteria inoculated into Sauton medium. Rpfs had only minor effects on growth of M. tuberculosis in BACTEC 12B broth, a rich medium. CONCLUSION: The mycobacterial Rpfs demonstrate resuscitation activities similar to those of the M. luteus Rpf.
TI  - Hemocyte-mediated phagocytosis and melanization in the mosquito Armigeres subalbatus following immune challenge by bacteria.
AB  - Mosquitoes are important vectors of disease. These insects respond to invading organisms with strong cellular and humoral immune responses that share many similarities with vertebrate immune systems. The strength and specificity of these responses are directly correlated to a mosquito's ability to transmit disease. In the current study, we characterized the hemocytes (blood cells) of Armigeres subalbatus by morphology (ultrastructure), lectin binding, enzyme activity, immunocytochemistry, and function. We found four hemocyte types: granulocytes, oenocytoids, adipohemocytes, and thrombocytoids. Granulocytes contained acid phosphatase activity and bound the exogenous lectins Helix pomatia agglutinin, Galanthus nivalis lectin, and wheat germ agglutinin. Following bacteria inoculation, granulocytes mounted a strong phagocytic response as early as 5 min postexposure. Bacteria also elicited a hemocyte-mediated melanization response. Phenoloxidase, the rate-limiting enzyme in the melanization pathway, was present exclusively in oenocytoids and in many of the melanotic capsules enveloping bacteria. The immune responses mounted against different bacteria were not identical; gram(-) Escherichia coli were predominantly phagocytosed and gram(+) Micrococcus luteus were melanized. These studies implicate hemocytes as the primary line of defense against bacteria.
TI  - Isolation, purification and partial characterization of antibacterial activities  produced by a newly isolated Streptomyces sp. US24 strain.
AB  - A new actinomycete strain designated US24 producing antibacterial activities against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria was isolated from Tunisian soil. Culture characteristic studies strongly suggested that the US24 strain belonged to the genus Streptomyces. Analysis of the nucleotide sequence of the 16S rRNA gene of the Streptomyces sp. US24 strain showed high similarity (98%) with the 16S rRNA gene of Streptomyces caelestis which produces two antibiotics, niddamycin and celesticetin. Study of the influence of different nutritional compounds on antibiotic biosynthesis showed that the highest antibacterial activities were obtained when starch at 1% (w/v) was used as sole carbon source in the presence of traces of mineral oligoelements. Application to the supernatant culture of the Streptomyces sp. US24 strain of various separation steps led to isolation of two pure active molecules having a retention time of 34 and 37.26 min, respectively. P(34 min) possessed antibacterial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, whereas P(37.26 min) inhibited only Gram-positive bacteria. Partial characterization of the P(34 min) molecule using spectroscopic studies showed that this active molecule is different from the two antibiotics produced by the S. caelestis strain.
TI  - Construction of biofilms with defined internal architecture using dielectrophoresis and flocculation.
AB  - A novel approach was developed for the construction of biofilms with defined internal architecture using AC electrokinetics and flocculation. Artificial structured microbial consortia (ASMC) consisting of localized layered microcolonies of different cell types were formed by sequentially attracting different cell types to high field regions near microelectrodes using dielectrophoresis. Stabilization of the microbial consortia on the electrode surface was achieved by crosslinking the cells using the flocculant polyethyleneimine (PEI). Consortia of Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae were made as model systems. Also, more natural consortia were made of the bacteria Pseudomonas putida, Clavibacter michiganense, and Methylobacterium mesophilum, which are found together in consortia during biodegradation of metal-cutting waste fluids.
TI  - The solution structures and activity of caerin 1.1 and caerin 1.4 in aqueous trifluoroethanol and dodecylphosphocholine micelles.
AB  - The caerin 1 peptides are among the most powerful of the broad-spectrum antibiotic amphibian peptides. Caerin 1.1 has previously been shown to form an amphipathic helix-bend-helix structure in aqueous trifluoroethanol (H. Wong, J. H. Bowie, and J. A. Carver European Journal Biochemistry, 1997, Vol. 247, pp. 545-557) and structure-activity relationship studies indicate that both helices are required for activity, as well as flexibility in the bend region connecting the two. The structure of caerin 1.1 in dodecylphosphocholine micelles was investigated and shown to be very similar to that determined in aqueous trifluoroethanol. Caerin 1.4, which is identical to caerin 1.1, but with serine residues replacing Val5 and Gly7, is less active than caerin 1.1 against most bacterial species but has improved activity against Escherichia coli and Micrococcus luteus. The solution NMR structure of caerin 1.4 was determined in both aqueous trifluoroethanol and dodecylphosphocholine micelles, and was shown to be similar to caerin 1.1. It was concluded that differences in the hydrophobicity and hydrophilic angle of the first helix are probably responsible for the different spectra of antibacterial activity. The similarity of the structures calculated in aqueous trifluoroethanol and dodecylphosphocholine micelles suggests that, for caerin 1.1 and 1.4, these solvent systems are equally as good at representing a membrane environment.
TI  - Detection of lysozyme-like enzymatic activity secreted by an immune-responsive mosquito cell line.
AB  - Using molecular approaches, we have recently shown that the C7-10 mosquito cell line from Aedes albopictus, and the Aag-2 line from Aedes aegypti, secrete a variety of immune peptides into the culture medium, including cecropins, defensins, transferrin, and lysozyme. The diversity of these peptides makes it difficult to quantify the relative activities of each molecule, because possible synergistic interactions may occur. Using a microtiter plate assay with live bacteria, we now show that C7-10 cells secrete an activity that is more potent against the Gram-positive bacterium, Micrococcus luteus, than against Gram-negative Escherichia coli. This lysozyme-like activity is accompanied by production of a lytic zone in an agarose plate assay containing commercially available, lyophilized M. luteus. Properties of the lysozyme-like activity from C7-10 cells included a broad pH optimum from 5.5 to 6.5, and heat-sensitivity above 42 degrees C. Amounts of secreted activity increased during the initial 24h of incubation with heat-killed bacteria. During this induction, lysozyme-like activity was found primarily in the cell culture supernatant.
TI  - Rapid phagocytosis and melanization of bacteria and Plasmodium sporozoites by hemocytes of the mosquito Aedes aegypti.
AB  - Mosquitoes are vectors of many deadly and debilitating pathogens. In the current  study, we used light and electron microscopies to study the immune response of Aedes aegypti hemocytes to bacterial inoculations, Plasmodium gallinaceum natural infections, and latex bead injections. After challenge, mosquitoes mounted strong phagocytic and melanization responses. Granulocytes phagocytosed bacteria singly or pooled them inside large membrane-delimited vesicles. Phagocytosis of bacteria, Plasmodium sporozoites, and latex beads was extensive; we estimated that individual granulocytes have the capacity to phagocytose hundreds of bacteria and thousands of latex particles. Oenocytoids were also seen to internalize bacteria and latex particles, although infrequently and with low capacity. Besides phagocytosis, mosquitoes cleared bacteria and sporozoites by melanization. Interestingly, the immune response toward 2 species of bacteria was different; most Escherichia coli were phagocytosed, but most Micrococcus luteus were melanized. Similar to E. coli, most Plasmodium sporozoites were phagocytosed. The immune response was rapid; phagocytosis and melanization of bacteria began as early as 5 min after inoculation. The magnitude and speed of the cellular response suggest that hemocytes, acting in concert with the humoral immune response, are the main force driving the battle against foreign invaders.
TI  - Crystallization and preliminary X-ray crystallographic studies of salt-tolerant glutaminase from Micrococcus luteus K-3.
AB  - Glutaminase from the marine bacterium Micrococcus luteus K-3 (Micrococcus glutaminase) is a salt-tolerant protein which shows equivalent activities both in the absence and the presence of 3 M sodium chloride and is distinct from halophilic proteins, which are inactivated in the absence of salt. To investigate the mechanisms of the salt-tolerant adaptation of Micrococcus glutaminase, the glutaminase and its major fragment containing about 80% of the protein were crystallized using the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion method. The glutaminase crystals belong to space group P622, with unit-cell parameters a = b = 111.4, c = 210.9 A, alpha = beta = 90, gamma = 120 degrees, and diffract to 2.6 A resolution. The fragment crystals belong to space group F222, with unit-cell parameters a = 115.7, b = 116.4, c = 144.9 A, alpha = beta = gamma = 90 degrees, and diffract to 2.4 A resolution. Data from selenomethionine (SeMet) substituted glutaminase crystals and from SeMet-substituted fragment crystals were collected to 2.6 and 2.4 A resolution, respectively. Structural analyses of the glutaminase and its fragment are currently being attempted using the multiwavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) phasing method.
TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial activity of fused Mannich ketones.
AB  - New Mannich ketones of fused bicyclic ketones as 1-indanones and 1-tetralones were prepared using the classical acid-catalysed Mannich reaction. Known members of this family were used in comparative biological tests. Antibacterial activity of these new water-soluble compounds was reported against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, E. coli ReD31m4, Salmonella minnesota Re595, Shigella sonnei Re4350, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Micrococcus luteus and Bacillus subtilis standard strains. Human cytotoxicity of our new compounds was evaluated against HeLa cell line. Some compounds showed low cytotoxicity (56.738 nM mL(-1) for 24, 47.497 nM mL(-1) for 31 and 48.379 nM mL(-1) for 26) and proved to be efficient antibacterial agents against the Gram-positive and partly against E. coli strains. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) changed in the range of 1.56->200 microg mL(-1). The deep rough mutants showed (generally eight times) higher sensitivity toward the compounds than the smooth E. coli. Hence, the permeability of Gram-negative outer membrane can influence the MIC values of our compounds. A preliminary quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) study indicated the maximum positive charge (MaxQ(+)) as the parameter that most significantly affected antibacterial activity against E. coli. In B. subtilis, the influence of a topological descriptor (first-order valence-connectivity index, XV1) was also revealed; however, other strains did not yield meaningful QSAR with the set of descriptors employed.
TI  - Humoral immune response of Simulium damnosum s.l. following filarial and bacterial infections.
AB  - The time-course of the humoral immune response of female blackflies after a challenge with bacteria, different Onchocerca microfilariae species, bacterial endotoxin and microfilarial extract was investigated. Strong bacteriolytic and growth inhibition activities against the Gram-positive bacterium Micrococcus luteus were induced by all agents. Specific differences were found in activity levels and time-course. Notably the endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced a very early, profound bacteriolytic and antibacterial response, which declined within a day after injection. In contrast, the bacteriolytic activities after Escherichia coli D31 and Onchocerca microfilariae infections were lower, but remained elevated over the observation period of 4 days. The bacteriolytic activity was correlated to a haemolymph protein with a molecular weight of around 14 kDa. Anti-Gram-positive activity in the E. coli infected group appeared within the first 6 h. However, it took 4 days in the microfilarial infected blackflies to reach significant levels. The active agent was identified to be a peptide with a molecular weight of around 4-4.5 kDa. Activity against the Gram-negative bacteria E. coli was detected in blackflies injected with E. coli D31, O. dukei microfilariae and microfilarial extract on days 1 and 4 after injection. The immune response in S. damnosum s.l. naturally infected via a bloodmeal on cattle supported the findings of the experimental infections. Similarities of the immune response kinetics between bacterial and filarial infections suggested that intracellular Wolbachia bacteria, released from microfilariae, could be responsible for the antibacterial response. This is supported by the observation that the induction of an immune response in the Drosophila melanogaster mbn-2 cell line by the filarial extract is blocked by polymyxin B, which forms inactive complexes with bacterial LPS.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of licorice flavonoids against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Nineteen flavonoids isolated from licorice (Glycyrrhiza glabra, G. inflata and G. uralensis) were tested for their antimicrobial activities against methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant S. aureus, Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Chemical constituents and antimicrobial activity of the essential oil of Lantana  xenica.
AB  - The aim of this work was to evaluate the chemical composition of Lantana xenica essential oil and its antimicrobial activity. The oil from the aerial parts of Lantana xenica Mold. (Verbenacea) was obtained by steam distillation and analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The major constituent of the oil was (E)-caryophyllene (35.2 %), with minor amounts of gamma-cadinene (13.3 %), alpha-pinene (9.3 %), ocimene (9.2 %) and germacrene D (6.6 %). The antimicrobial assays showed that the essential oil of L. xenica inhibited the growth of Bacillus cereus and Proteus mirabilis and both bacteria were inhibited by (E)-caryophyllene, the major component of the oil. Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus epidermidis and S. aureus showed a lower inhibition. The bacteria Micrococcus luteus, Klebsiella sp., Escherichia coli and the yeast Candida albicans were insensitive to both the oil and (E)-caryophyllene.
TI  - The antibacterial activity of topical retinoids: the case of retinaldehyde.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Retinoids such as retinoic acid (RA), retinol (ROL) and retinaldehyde (RAL) are currently used in many formulations and indications ranging form acne to skin aging. Most if not all their pharmacological activities occur through binding to nuclear receptors with subsequent modulation of the activities of several genes. Little attention has been given to the many other potential actions on the surface of the skin. AIM: To analyse the potential anti-infective activities of topical ROL, RAL and RA. METHODS: Microbial minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of ROL, RAL and RA were determined by a microdilution method on reference strains including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Micrococcus flavus, Propionibacterium acnes, Micrococcus luteus, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus hominis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans and 133 clinical strains including methicillin-resistant S. aureus, methicillin-sensitive S. aureus, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, Streptococcus group B, Enterococcus faecalis, vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis, vancomycin-resistant E. faecium and Pseudomonas/Klebsiella. In two clinical trials in healthy human volunteers, skin bacterial densities were evaluated in samples obtained with the cylinder scrub method: (1). 2 and 5 h after a single application of 0.05% RAL or vehicle on the forearm and (2). in a single-blind randomized study where 0.05% RAL or vehicle were applied daily for 2 weeks on the forehead of 22 volunteers. Paired results from treated (or vehicle) and untreated areas were analysed. RESULTS: Of the three retinoids tested, only RAL showed a significant in vitro antibacterial activity; this activity was found against reference strains of gram-positive bacteria like S. aeureus, Micrococcus spp. or P. acnes. No activity was found against gram-negative bacteria. These results on reference strains were confirmed on 133 clinical isolates. MIC(50) and MIC(90) values for RAL were 8 and 16 mg/l, respectively, for methicillin-sensitive S. aureus and 4 and 8 mg/l for methicillin-resistant S. aureus. The two in vivo studies showed that areas treated with RAL had a significant decrease in the bacterial counts. In the forehead study, the median decrease was 10(2) log/cm(2) for P. acnes and 10(1.8) log/cm(2) for staphylococci. No resistant bacteria were found after 2 weeks of topical use. Preliminary results suggest that the antibacterial effect of RAL is due, in part, to the aldehyde group in the lateral chain, since non-retinoid pseudo-analogues of the chain, like citral and hexenal, showed a similar antibacterial activity. CONCLUSION: We have shown that RAL differs from parent natural retinoids such as ROL and RA in demonstrating significant antibacterial activities upon topical use. This activity is likely due to the aldehyde group in the isoprenoic lateral chain, which illustrates the potential bifunctional properties of some retinoids.
TI  - Photocatalytic oxidation of bacteria, bacterial and fungal spores, and model biofilm components to carbon dioxide on titanium dioxide-coated surfaces.
AB  - We report carbon mass balance and kinetic data for the total oxidation of cells,  spores, and biomolecules deposited on illuminated titanium dioxide surfaces in contact with air. Carbon dioxide formation by photocatalytic oxidation of methanol, glucose, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus subtilis (cells and spores), Aspergillus niger spores, phosphatidylethanolamine, bovine serum albumin, and gum xanthan was determined as a function of time. The quantitative data provide mass balance and rate information for removal of these materials from a photocatalytic surface. This kind of information is importantfor applications of photocatalytic chemistry in air and water purification and disinfection, self-cleaning surfaces, and the development of self-cleaning air filters.
TI  - The activity of p-methoxybenzylisothiocyanate against Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Haemophilus ducreyi, and other microorganisms.
AB  - p-Methoxybenzylisothiocyanate was isolated from Lepidium bonariense and found to  be responsible for the plants antimicrobial and STD activity. MIC determinations were conducted for p-methoxybenzylisothiocyanate on Haemophilus ducreyi, Neisseria gonorrheae, Candida albicans, Bacillus subtilus, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter sp., Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Psuedomanas aeruginosa. An in vitro cellular toxicity assay showed that at 100 microM (17,9 microg/mL) p-methoxybenzylisothiocyanate is not toxic to living cells.
TI  - Activity of essential oils of three Micromeria species (Lamiaceae) against micromycetes and bacteria.
AB  - The chemical composition of essential oils from three Micromeria species: M. dalmatica Benth., M. albanica (Griceb. ex K. Mal) Silic and M. thymifolia (Scop.) Fritsch were investigated by GC and GC-MS and their antibacterial and antifungal activities against seven fungal and six bacterial species were evaluated. Biological assays showed strong fungitoxicity of oils from all three Micromeria spp., particularly M. albanica, against all fungi tested. Essential oils of these species also exerted antibacterial effect against Streptococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis and Micrococcus luteus at low concentrations. Higher concentrations of essential oil of M. albanica and M. dalmatica were active against Gram-negative Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which could be due to the high content of piperitenone oxide.
TI  - Synthesis and pharmacological activities of 1,8-naphthyridine derivatives.
AB  - In the present study, a series of 2-substituted-4-methyl-7-amino/4,7-dimethyl-1,8-naphthyridines were synthesized and characterized by IR, 1H-NMR and elemental analysis. The compounds were investigated for anticonvulsant (125, 250 mg/kg), cardiac and antimicrobial activities. The compounds were screened for antibacterial activity against gram (+) bacteria (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcusfaecalis and Micrococcus luteus) and gram (-) bacteria (Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhi). All the compounds except 2-(3'-phenylaminopropyloxy)-4-methyl-7-amino-1,8-naphthyridine exhibited significant anticonvulsant activity. The anticonvulsant activity of 2-(3-morpholino-2'-hydroxypropyloxy)-4-methyl-7-amino-1,8-naphthyridine, 2-(3'-diphenylamino-2'-hydroxypropyloxy)-4-methyl-7-amino-1,8-naphthyridine and 2-(3'-diethanolamino-propyloxy)-4,7-dimethy-1,8-naphthyridine at the dose of 250 mg/kg were found to be equivalent to diazepam (5 mg/kg). Sympathetic blocking activity was observed with 2-(3'-phenylamino-2'-hydroxypropyloxy)-4-methyl-7-amino-1,8-naphthyridine, 2-(3'-diethanolamino-2'-hydroxypropyloxy)-4-methyl-7-amino-1,8-naphthyridine and 2-(3'-diphenylamino-2'-hydroxypropyloxy)-4-methyl-7-amino-1,8-naphthyridine only. All the compounds were devoid of antibacterial activity against the tested bacteria.
TI  - Essential oil constituents and in vitro antimicrobial activity of Decalepis hamiltonii roots against foodborne pathogens.
AB  - Hydrodistillation of Decalepis hamiltonii roots yielded an essential oil (0.33% v/w) that contained 2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzaldehyde (37.45%), 2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (31.01%), 4-O-methylresorcylaldehyde (9.12%), benzyl alcohol (3.16%), and alpha-atlantone (2.06%) as major constituents, with aromatic aldehydes constituting the main fraction of this root's essential oil. The oil was tested for its antimicrobial activity against foodborne pathogens responsible for food spoilage and human pathologies using standard antimicrobial assays. It exhibited strong antimicrobial activity against Bacillus cereus, Bacillus megaterium, Candida albicans, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, Micrococcus roseus, and Staphylococcus aureus at a concentration range of 1:0 with inhibitory activities of 27, 23, 16, 19, 22, 19, and 23 mm, respectively, which are comparable to those of the standards. The roots of D. hamiltonii, therefore, may be considered as an inexpensive source of an essential oil rich in antimicrobial compounds against foodborne pathogens.
TI  - Bass hepcidin is a novel antimicrobial peptide induced by bacterial challenge.
AB  - We report the isolation of a novel antimicrobial peptide, bass hepcidin, from the gill of hybrid striped bass, white bass (Morone chrysops) x striped bass (M. saxatilis). After the intraperitoneal injection of Micrococcus luteus and Escherichia coli, the peptide was purified from HPLC fractions with antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli. Sequencing by Edman degradation revealed a 21-residue peptide (GCRFCCNCCPNMSGCGVCCRF) with eight putative cysteines. Molecular mass measurements of the native peptide and the reduced and alkylated peptide confirmed the sequence with four intramolecular disulfide bridges. Peptide sequence homology to human hepcidin and other predicted hepcidins, indicated that the peptide is a new member of the hepcidin family. Nucleotide sequences for cDNA and genomic DNA were determined for white bass. A predicted prepropeptide (85 amino acids) consists of three domains: a signal peptide (24 amino acids), prodomain (40 amino acids) and a mature peptide (21 amino acids). The gene has two introns and three exons. A TATA box and several consensus-binding motifs for transcription factors including C/EBP, nuclear factor-kappaB, and hepatocyte nuclear factor were found in the region upstream of the transcriptional start site. In white bass liver, hepcidin gene expression was induced 4500-fold following challenge with the fish pathogen, Streptococcus iniae, while expression levels remained low in all other tissues tested. A novel antimicrobial peptide from the gill, bass hepcidin, is predominantly expressed in the liver and highly inducible by bacterial exposure.
TI  - Immunopeptides in the defense reactions of Glossina morsitans to bacterial and Trypanosoma brucei brucei infections.
AB  - Several dipteran insects are vectors of parasites causing major human infectious  diseases. Among these, the tsetse fly, Glossina spp., is responsible for the transmission of trypanosomes, the pathogens responsible for sleeping sickness in Africa. A better understanding of insect-parasite interactions will help establish new strategies to fight this important often fatal disease. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are part of the humoral immune response in insects during bacterial, fungal and parasitic infections. Here, we studied the immune response of Glossina morsitans to bacteria and to Trypanosoma brucei brucei by analyzing the synthesis of AMPs as markers of the humoral immune response. By reversed-phase chromatography, mass spectrometry analysis, Edman degradation and in vitro antimicrobial assays of the hemolymph of immune-challenged adults of G. morsitans, we identified three AMPs: a cecropin, an attacin and a defensin. These three AMPs were found to be induced upon systemic bacterial infection and also after per os infections by bacteria and parasites.
TI  - Correlation of the antibacterial activities of cationic peptide antibiotics and cationic steroid antibiotics.
AB  - The antibacterial activities of cationic steroid antibiotics and cationic peptide antibiotics have been compared. Depolarization of bacterial membranes, activation of bacterial stress-related gene promoters, and changes in bacterial morphologies caused by these antibiotics suggest that cationic steroid and peptide antibiotics share mechanistic aspects. Modified cationic steroid antibiotics display improved selectivity for prokaryotic cells over eukaryotic cells presumably due to increased charge recognition.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of the antimicrobial activity of a castor oil-based irrigant.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of irrigating solutions--Endoquil (castor oil detergent), 2% chlorhexidine gluconate solution, and 0.5% NaOCl solution-was evaluated against gram-positive cocci (Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus mutans, and Streptococcus sobrinus), gram-negative rods (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa), and the yeast Candida albicans. Activity was evaluated using the two-layer agar diffusion technique. The base layer was obtained by pouring 10.0 ml of Muller Hinton Medium or 10.0 ml of Brain Heart Infusion agar in a Petri dish. After solidification a 5.0 ml seed layer of Muller Hinton Medium or Brain Heart Infusion agar with inoculum (106/ml) was added. Absorbent paper disks (6.0 mm in diameter) immersed in the solutions were placed at equidistant points. Plates were maintained at room temperature for 2 h for prediffusion of the solutions and incubated at 37 degrees C for 24 h. The candle jar system was used for the Brain Heart Infusion agar plates. All tests were performed in duplicate. After incubation the medium was optimized with 0.05 g% triphenyltetrazolium chlorate gel and inhibition halos were measured. All bacterial strains were inhibited by 2.0% chlorhexidine gluconate. Endoquil was effective against gram-positive microorganisms, and 0.5% NaOCl was effective only against S. aureus.
TI  - Hand disinfection according to the European Standard EN 1500 (hygienic handrub):  a study with gram-negative and gram-positive test organisms.
AB  - It was the aim of this study to compare the efficacy of alcohol-based hand disinfectants according to European Standard EN 1500 (hygienic handrub), using the routine test organism Escherichia coli and, additionally, Micrococcus luteus as a surrogate for Gram-positive pathogens. One ethanol-based hand disinfectant (product A) and one propanol-based hand disinfectant (product B) were used in all experiments. Product B (propanol-based) was significantly more effective against both test organisms than product A (ethanol-based) in quantitative suspension tests but not in tests simulating practical conditions. In the experiments according to EN 1500 germ reduction rates obtained with the ethanol-containing formulation A were identical for E. coli and M. luteus. Product B was slightly, but not significantly more effective against M. luteus. To conclude, using E. coli as the test organism for evaluating the antibacterial efficacy of alcoholic hand disinfectants under practical conditions even appears to be sufficient to permit the drawing of conclusions for Gram-positive pathogens. However, more alcohol-based hand disinfectants should be tested in further studies to verify the results obtained.
TI  - Drosophila MyD88 is required for the response to fungal and Gram-positive bacterial infections.
AB  - We report here the identification and functional characterization of DmMyD88, a gene encoding the Drosophila homolog of mammalian MyD88. DmMyD88 combines a Toll-IL-1R homology (TIR) domain and a death domain. Overexpression of DmMyD88 was sufficient to induce expression of the antifungal peptide Drosomycin, and induction of Drosomycin was markedly reduced in DmMyD88-mutant flies. DmMyD88 interacted with Toll through its TIR domain and required the death domain proteins Tube and Pelle to activate expression of Drs, which encodes Drosomycin. DmMyD88-mutant flies were highly susceptible to infection by fungi and Gram-positive bacteria, but resisted Gram-negative bacterial infection much as did wild-type flies. Phenotypic comparison of DmMyD88-mutant flies and MyD88-deficient mice showed essential differences in the control of Gram-negative infection in insects and mammals.
TI  - Enteric bacteria counteract lipopolysaccharide induction of antimicrobial peptide genes.
AB  - The humoral immunity of Drosophila involves the production of antimicrobial peptides, which are induced by evolutionary conserved microbial molecules, like LPS. By using Drosophila mbn-2 cells, we found that live bacteria, including E. coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Erwinia carotovora, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, prevented LPS from inducing antimicrobial peptide genes, while Micrococcus luteus and Streptococcus equi did not. The inhibitory effect was seen at bacterial levels from 20 per mbn-2 cell, while antimicrobial peptides were induced at lower bacterial concentrations (< or =2 bacteria per cell) also in the absence of added LPS. Gel shift experiment suggests that the inhibitory effect is upstream or at the level of the activation of the transcription factor Relish, a member of the NF-kappaB/Rel family. The bacteria have to be in physical contact with the cells, but not phagocytosed, to prevent LPS induction. Interestingly, the inhibiting mechanism is, at least for E. coli, independent of the type III secretion system, indicating that the inhibitory mechanism is unrelated to the one earlier described for YopJ from Yersinia.
TI  - Two novel insect defensins from larvae of the cupreous chafer, Anomala cuprea: purification, amino acid sequences and antibacterial activity.
AB  - A humoral immune response in larvae of the coleopteran insect, Anomala cuprea has been examined for exploring the molecular basis of host-pathogen interactions. The antibacterial activity against the Gram-positive strain, Micrococcus luteus was detected at a low level in absence of injection. The activity increased strikingly in the hemolymph of the larvae challenged with Escherichia coli, showing the fluctuating profile through a time course, which consists of the static induction phase, the production phase rising to a maximum level, and the reduction phase extending over a long duration. Two peptides were purified and characterized by reverse-phase HPLC, Edman degradation and mass spectrometry. They were isoforms, composed of similar sequences with two amino acid substitutions in 43 residues, and novel members of the insect defensins, cysteine-rich antibacterial peptides. Anomala defensins A and B showed potent activity against Gram-positive bacteria, with slight differences in activity against a few strains of tested bacteria. Anomala defensin B was active at high concentration of 40 microM against the Gram-negative strain, Xenorhabdus japonicus, a pathogen toward the host, A. cuprea larvae.
TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial study of unsaturated Mannich ketones.
AB  - Several Mannich ketones of 2-arylmethylenecycloalkanones were synthesised using the classical acid-catalysed Mannich reaction. Antibacterial activity of these new water-soluble compounds was reported against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Micrococcus luteus and Bacillus subtilis standard strains. Human cell line cytotoxicity of our new compounds was evaluated against HeLa cell lines. Some compounds showed low cytotoxicity (41.52 nM mL(-1) for 14 and 46.60 nM mL(-1) for 18) and proved to be efficient antibacterial agents against the Gram-positive strains. Minimum inhibitory concentrations varied from 1.56 to 100 microg mL(-1). The mechanism of action was examined, too.
TI  - Dicynthaurin: an antimicrobial peptide from hemocytes of the solitary tunicate, Halocynthia aurantium.
AB  - We isolated a novel antimicrobial peptide, dicynthaurin, from hemocytes of a tunicate, Halocynthia aurantium. The native peptide had a mass of approximately 6.2 kDa and was composed of two 30-residue monomers without sequence homology to any previously identified peptides (ILQKAVLDCLKAAGSSLSKAAITAIYNKIT). Most cynthaurin molecules were C-terminally amidated and were linked covalently by a single cystine disulfide bond. When performed in membrane-mimetic environments, circular dichroism studies of dicynthaurin revealed largely alpha-helical conformations. Dicynthaurin's broad-spectrum activity encompassed Gram-positive (Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes) and Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa), but not Candida albicans, a fungus. Although dicynthaurin was purified from a marine invertebrate, its antimicrobial activity was optimal at NaCl concentrations below 100 mM. This suggests that the antimicrobial actions of this molecule may take place intracellularly (e.g., within a phagosome) rather than extracellularly.
TI  - Benzopyran derivatives from Mallotus apelta.
AB  - From the leaves of Mallotus apelta, seven benzopyran compounds were obtained and  their structures were determined using spectroscopic methods. One showed moderate antibiotic activity against Micrococcus lutens.
TI  - The effect of cyclization of magainin 2 and melittin analogues on structure, function, and model membrane interactions: implication to their mode of action.
AB  - The amphipathic alpha-helical structure is a common motif found in membrane binding polypeptides including cell lytic peptides, antimicrobial peptides, hormones, and signal sequences. Numerous studies have been undertaken to understand the driving forces for partitioning of amphipathic alpha-helical peptides into membranes, many of them based on the antimicrobial peptide magainin 2 and the non-cell-selective cytolytic peptide melittin, as paradigms. These studies emphasized the role of linearity in their mode of action. Here we synthesized and compared the structure, biological function, and interaction with model membranes of linear and cyclic analogues of these peptides. Cyclization altered the binding of melittin and magainin analogues to phospholipid membranes. However, at similar bound peptide:lipid molar ratios, both linear and cyclic analogues preserved their high potency to permeate membranes. Furthermore, the cyclic analogues preserved approximately 75% of the helical structure of the linear peptides when bound to membranes. Biological activity studies revealed that the cyclic melittin analogue had increased antibacterial activity but decreased hemolytic activity, whereas the cyclic magainin 2 analogue had a marked decrease in both antibacterial and hemolytic activities. The results indicate that the linearity of the peptides is not essential for the disruption of the target phospholipid membrane, but rather provides the means to reach it. In addition, interfering with the coil-helix transition by cyclization, while maintaining the same sequence of hydrophobic and positively charged amino acids, allows a separated evaluation of the hydrophobic and electrostatic contributions to binding of peptides to membranes.
TI  - Inhibition tests for detection and presumptive identification of tetracyclines, beta-lactam antibiotics and quinolones in poultry meat.
AB  - A combination of three plates, seeded with strains of Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus cereus or Escherichia coli, can be used for detection of residues of beta-lactam antibiotics, tetracyclines and fluoroquinolones. The sensitivity of each plate is optimal for only one of these groups, resulting in detection limits (LOD) lower than the corresponding maximum residue limits (MRL) and in distinct inhibition patterns typical for each antibiotic family. Beta-lactam antibiotics such as penicillin G, ampicillin and amoxicillin give only inhibition zones on the plate with M. luteus. Tetracyclines are detected up to the MRL level with B. cereus, and fluoroquinolones with E. coli. The LODs of the antibiotics tested were as follows: penicillin G (PENG) 0.9 ng, ampicillin (AMPI) 0.6 ng and amoxicillin (AMOX) 1.0 ng on the plate with M. luteus; tetracycline (TET) 4 ng, oxytetracycline (OXY) 3 ng, doxycycline (DOX) 0.6 ng, and chlortetracycline (CHL) 0.3 ng on the plate with B. cereus; enrofloxacin (ENRX) 1.5 ng, ciprofloxacin (CIPX) 0.5 ng and flumequine (FLUM) 1.5 ng on the plate with E. coli. The combination of plates enables the laboratory to select appropriate chromatographic techniques for identification and quantification of the residues. On the other hand, the three groups can also be detected on one plate seeded with Bacillus subtilis, although the limits of detection are higher: PENG 0.4 ng, AMPI and AMOX 3 ng, TET 5 ng, OXY 8 ng, DOX 1 ng, CHL 0.5 ng, ENRX 4 ng, CIPX 10 ng and FLUM 4 ng. The test was applied to 228 broiler fillets and to 27 turkey thighs, originating from different poultry slaughterhouses. Nineteen broiler fillets contained inhibiting substances. The positive results of the inhibition tests were confirmed with a chromatographic technique. Doxycycline residues were found in 16 samples and amoxicillin in two.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of honokiol and magnolol isolated from Magnolia officinalis.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of honokiol and magnolol, the main constituents of Magnolia officinalis was investigated. The antimicrobial activity was assayed by the agar dilution method using brain heart infusion medium and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) were determined for each compound using a twofold serial dilution assay. The results showed that honokiol and magnolol have a marked antimicrobial effect (MIC = 25 microg/mL) against Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Micrococcus luteus and Bacillus subtilis, but did not show antimicrobial activity (MIC > or = 100 microg/mL) for Shigella flexneii, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus vulgaris, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Our results indicate that honokiol and magnolol, although less potent than tetracycline, show a significant antimicrobial activity for periodontal pathogens. Hence we suggest that honokiol and magnolol might have the potential to be an adjunct in the treatment of periodontitis.
TI  - Improved agar diffusion method for detecting residual antimicrobial agents.
AB  - The improved agar diffusion method for determination of residual antimicrobial agents was investigated, and the sensitivities of various combinations of test organisms and assay media were determined using 7 organisms, 5 media, and 31 antimicrobial agents. Bacillus stearothermophilus and synthetic assay medium (SAM) showed the greatest sensitivity for screening penicillins (penicillin G and ampicillin). The combination of Bacillus subtilis and minimum medium (MM) was the most sensitive for tetracyclines (oxytetracycline and chlortetracycline), B. stearothermophilus and SAM or Micrococcus luteus and Mueller-Hinton agar (MHA) for detecting tylosin and erythromycin, B. subtilis and MHA for aminoglycosides (streptomycin, kanamycin, gentamicin, and dihydrostreptomycin), B. stearothermophilus and SAM for polyethers (salinomycin and lasalocid), and B. subtilis and MM or Clostridium perfringens and GAM for polypeptides (thiopeptin, enramycin, virginiamycin, and bacitracin). However, gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli ATCC 27166 and MM were better for screening for colistin and polymixin-B. For detecting the synthetic drugs tested, the best combination was B. subtilis and MM for sulfonamides, E. coli 27166 and MM for quinolones (oxolinic acid and nalidixic acid), B. subtilis and MM for furans (furazolidone), and the bioluminescent bacterium Photobacterium phosphoreum and luminescence assay medium for chloramphenicol and oxolinic acid. The results showed that the use of four assay plates, B. stearothermophilus and SAM, B. subtilis and MM, M. luteus and MHA, and E. coli 27166 and MM, was superior to the currently available techniques for screening for residual antimicrobial agents in edible animal tissues.
TI  - PCR cloning of the resuscitation-promoting factor (Rpf) gene from Micrococcus luteus, sequencing and expression in Escherichia coli.
AB  - A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) cloning procedure was developed for the resuscitation-promoting factor (Rpf) gene of Micrococcus luteus using strains NCIMB 13267, JCM 1464T, JCM 3347, and JCM 3348. A PCR product of the Rpf gene fragment was ligated into a cloning vector pBluescript II KS (+) with the restriction endonucleases Eco RI and Bam HI. The ligation mixture was used to transform Escherichia coli DH5alpha. The DNA sequence of the Rpf gene cloned from strain JCM 1464T was 84% homologous with that of NCIMB 13267, and from strains JCM 3347 and JCM 3348 it was 100% and 86% homologous, respectively. Recombinant Rpf proteins of M. luteus NCIMB 13267 and JCM 1464T after expression in E. coli BL21 harbouring the pET-19b-Rpf plasmid, and after purification, were approximately 16 kD for both strains.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of antimicrobial activity of sealers and pastes used in endodontics.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of four root canal sealers (AH Plus, Sealapex, Ketac Endo, and Fill Canal), two calcium hydroxide pastes (Calen and Calasept), and a zinc oxide paste was evaluated. Seven bacterial strains were used, six of them standard; Micrococcus luteus ATCC 9341, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, and Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 10541. There was a wild strain of Streptococcus mutans isolated from saliva obtained in an adult dental clinic. Activity was evaluated using the agar diffusion method with Brain Heart Infusion agar and Muller Hinton medium seeded by pour plate. Calcium hydroxide-based sealers and pastes were either placed directly into 4.0 x 4.0 mm wells or by using absorbent paper points. The plates were kept at room temperature for 2 hr for diffusion. After incubation at 37 degrees C for 24 hr, the medium was optimized with 0.05 g% TTC gel and inhibition haloes were measured. All bacterial strains were inhibited by all materials using the well method. However, when the materials were applied with absorbent paper points, Enterococcus faecalis was not inhibited by zinc oxide, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was not inhibited by AH Plus, Fill Canal, and the zinc oxide-based paste. We conclude that sealers and pastes presented antimicrobial activity in vitro and culture medium optimization with 0.05 g% TTC gel facilitated observation of the inhibition haloes.
TI  - An alternative cis-isoprenyltransferase activity in yeast that produces polyisoprenols with chain lengths similar to mammalian dolichols.
AB  - Dolichyl monophosphate (Dol-P) is a polyisoprenoid glycosyl carrier lipid essential for the assembly of a variety of glycoconjugates in the endoplasmic reticulum of eukaryotic cells. In yeast, dolichols with chain lengths of 14--17 isoprene units are predominant, whereas in mammalian cells they contain 19--22 isoprene units. In this biosynthetic pathway, t,t-farnesyl pyrophosphate is elongated to the appropriate long chain polyprenyl pyrophosphate by the sequential addition of cis-isoprene units donated by isopentenyl pyrophosphate with t,t,c-geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate being the initial intermediate formed. The condensation steps are catalyzed by cis-isoprenyltransferase (cis-IPTase). Genes encoding cis-IPTase activity have been identified in Micrococcus luteus, Escherichia coli, Arabidopsis thaliana, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (RER2). Yeast cells deleted for the RER2 locus display a severe growth defect, but are still viable, possibly due to the activity of an homologous locus, SRT1. The dolichol and Dol-P content of exponentially growing revertants of RER2 deleted cells (Delta rer2) and of cells overexpressing SRT1 have been determined by HPLC analysis. Dolichols and Dol-Ps with 19--22 isoprene units, unusually long for yeast, were found, and shown to be utilized for the biosynthesis of lipid intermediates involved in protein N-glycosylation. In addition, cis-IPTase activity in microsomes from Delta rer2 cells overexpressing SRT1 was 7- to 17-fold higher than in microsomes from Delta rer2 cells. These results establish that yeast contains at least two cis-IPTases, and indicate that the chain length of dolichols is determined primarily by the enzyme catalyzing the chain elongation stage of the biosynthetic process.
TI  - Properties of the prophenoloxidase activating enzyme of the freshwater crayfish,  Pacifastacus leniusculus.
AB  - The prophenoloxidase activating enzyme (ppA), a serine proteinase catalyzing the  conversion of prophenoloxidase to an active phenoloxidase, has a molecular mass of about 36 kDa in its active form. This protein was cloned from a blood cell cDNA library and its corresponding cDNA of 1736 base pairs encodes a zymogenic protein (proppA) of 468 amino acids. An antibody raised against a synthetic peptide derived from a region of the cDNA sequence could efficiently inhibit the beta-1,3-glucan triggered activation of prophenoloxidase in vitro. The C-terminal half of the proppA is composed of a typical serine proteinase domain, with a sequence similar to other invertebrate and vertebrate serine proteinases. The N-terminal half contains a cationic glycine-rich domain, a cationic proline-rich domain and a clip-domain, in which the disulfide-bonding pattern is likely to be identical to those of the horseshoe crab big defensin and mammalian beta-defensins. Antibodies made against both the C- and the N-terminal halves recognize two proppAs under reducing conditions. However, under nonreducing conditions only the anti-C antibody recognized the two proppAs, which suggests that a conformational change takes place upon reduction that allows the anti-N to react with the N-terminal half of proppA. The recombinant clip-domain in crayfish proppA was overexpressed in Escherichia coli and the resulting peptide exhibited antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacterial strains such as Micrococcus luteus Ml11 and Bacillus megaterium Bm11 with 50% growth inhibitory concentrations of 1.43 microM and 17.9 microM, respectively. These results suggest that the clip-domains in proppAs may function as antibacterial peptides.
TI  - Influence of microbial species on small intestinal myoelectric activity and transit in germ-free rats.
AB  - The effect of an intestinal microflora consisting of selected microbial species on myoelectric activity of small intestine was studied using germ-free rat models, with recording before and after specific intestinal colonization, in the unanesthetized state. Intestinal transit, neuropeptides in blood (RIA), and neuromessengers in the intestinal wall were determined. Clostridium tabificum vp 04 promoted regular spike burst activity, shown by a reduction of the migrating myoelectric complex (MMC) period from 30.5 +/- 3.9 min in the germ-free state to 21.2 +/- 0.14 min (P < 0.01). Lactobacillus acidophilus A10 and Bifidobacterium bifidum B11 reduced the MMC period from 27.9 +/- 4.5 to 21.5 +/- 2.1 min (P < 0.02) and accelerated small intestinal transit (P < 0.05). Micrococcus luteus showed an inhibitory effect, with an MMC period of 35.9 +/- 9.3 min compared with 27.7 +/- 6.3 min in germ-free rats (P < 0.01). Inhibition was indicated also for Escherichia coli X7 gnotobiotic rats. No consistent changes in slow wave frequency were observed. The concentration of neuropeptide Y in blood decreased after introduction of conventional intestinal microflora, suggesting reduced inhibitory control. Intestinal bacteria promote or suppress the initiation and aboral migration of the MMC depending on the species involved. Bacteria with primitive fermenting metabolism (anaerobes) emerge as important promoters of regular spike burst activity in small intestine.
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial activities of some 3-arylamino-5-[2-(substituted 1-imidazolyl)ethyl]-1,2,4-triazole derivatives.
AB  - In this study, some 3-arylamino-5-[2-(substituted imidazol-1-yl or benzimidazol-1-yl)ethyl]-1,2,4-triazole derivatives were synthesised by reacting 3-(substituted imidazol-1-yl)propionyl hydrazides, with S-methyl-N'-arylisothiouronium iodide salts. Their structures were elucidated by IR, 1H-NMR and mass spectroscopic data and elemental analyses results. Antimicrobial activities of the compounds were observed against Staphylococcus aureus NRRL B-767, Micrococcus luteus NRRL B-4375, Escherichia coli B, Pseudomonas aeroginosa NRRL B-23 and the fungi Candida albicans and Candida glabrata by using the tube dilution technique. Remarkable activity was obtained.
TI  - The presence of antibacterial and opioid peptides in human plasma during coronary artery bypass surgery.
AB  - Antibacterial peptides, found in both invertebrates and vertebrates, represent a  potential innate defense mechanism against microbial infections. However, it is unknown whether this process occurs in humans during surgery. We looked for evidence of release of antibacterial peptides during coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). We used immunological techniques and antibacterial assays combined with high-performance gel-permeation chromatography, reverse-phase HPLC, N-terminal sequencing and comparison with synthetic standards to characterize the peptide B/enkelytin. We show the presence of anionic antibacterial peptide, the peptide B/enkelytin which correspond to the C-terminal part of proenkephalin A, from the plasma of patients undergoing CABG. Our studies show that peptide B/enkelytin is initially present at low levels in plasma and is then released in increased amounts just after skin incision. Antibacterial assays confirmed that the peptides specifically target gram-positive bacteria. We also demonstrate that peptide B/enkelytin is metabolized in vivo to the opioid peptides methionine-enkephalin-Arg-Phe and methionine-enkephalin, peptides that we show have granulocyte chemotactic activity. These findings suggest that in humans, surgical incision leads to the release of antibacterial peptides. Furthermore, these antibacterial peptides can be metabolized into compounds that have immune-activating properties.
TI  - Structural basis of polyamine-DNA recognition: spermidine and spermine interactions with genomic B-DNAs of different GC content probed by Raman spectroscopy.
AB  - Four genomic DNAs of differing GC content (Micrococcus luteus, 72% GC; Escherichia coli, 50% GC; calf thymus, 42% GC; Clostridium perfringens, 27% GC) have been employed as targets of interaction by the cationic polyamines spermidine ([H(3)N(CH(2))(3)NH(2)(CH(2))(4)NH(3)](3+)) and spermine ([(CH(2))(4)(NH(2)(CH(2))(3)NH(3))(2)](4+)). In solutions containing 60 mM DNA phosphate (approximately 20 mg DNA/ml) and either 1, 5 or 60 mM polyamine, only Raman bands associated with the phosphates exhibit large spectral changes, demonstrating that B-DNA phosphates are the primary targets of interaction. Phosphate perturbations, which are independent of base composition, are consistent with a model of non-specific cation binding in which delocalized polyamines diffuse along DNA while confined by the strong electrostatic potential gradient perpendicular to the helix axis. This finding provides experimental support for models in which polyamine-induced DNA condensation is driven by non-specific electrostatic binding. The Raman spectra also demonstrate that major groove sites (guanine N7 and thymine C5H(3)) are less affected than phosphates by polyamine-DNA interactions. Modest dependence of polyamine binding on genome base composition suggests that sequence context plays only a secondary role in recognition. Importantly, the results demonstrate that polyamine binding has a negligible effect on the native B-form secondary structure. The capability of spermidine or spermine to bind and condense genomic B-DNA without disrupting the native structure must be taken into account when considering DNA organization within bacterial nucleoids or cell nuclei.
TI  - Classification of a bacterial isolate, from pozol, exhibiting antimicrobial activity against several gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, yeasts, and molds.
AB  - A bacterial isolate, designated CS93, capable of producing a broad-spectrum antimicrobial compound(s) effective against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, yeasts, and molds was isolated from pozol, a fermented maize product. This strain was phenotypically similar to another pozol isolate that was previously designated as Agrobacterium azotophilium by other investigators. By using biochemical, phenotypic, and 16S rRNA sequence analysis, both pozol isolates were identified as members of the genus Bacillus, possibly a variant of Bacillus subtilis. While the antimicrobial compound(s) was initially produced only on a solid medium, parameters were identified for production in broth. The compound(s) was heat stable (121 degrees C for 15 min), exhibited activity over a wide pH range (pH 3 to pH 11), and was inactivated by pronase E. The antimicrobial compound(s) was bactericidal and bacteriolytic against Escherichia coli V517, bacteriostatic against Micrococcus luteus, and fungistatic against Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The inhibitory compound(s) could possibly serve as a food biopreservative.
TI  - Overexpression, purification, and characterization of Bacillus subtilis N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase CwlC.
AB  - N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase CwlC of Bacillus subtilis was overproduced in  Escherichia coli and purified 21-fold. The amidase hydrolyzed type A cell walls such as B. subtilis. The amidase bound slightly to the Microbacterium lacticum cell wall (type B), but did not entirely hydrolyze it. The presence of calcium or magnesium ion increased the resistance of the amidase to heat denaturation.
TI  - Cytotoxic cardenolides and antibacterial terpenoids from Crossopetalum gaumeri.
AB  - From the methanol extract of the roots of (Crossopetalum gaumeri, four new highly cytotoxic cardenolides, securigenin-3beta-O-beta-6-deoxyguloside (2), 19-hydroxy-sarmentogenin-3beta-O-beta-6-deoxyguloside (4), sarmentogenin-3beta-O-[alpha-allosyl-(1-->4)-beta-6-deoxy alloside] (5), and securigenin-3beta-O-[alpha-allosyl-(1-->4)-beta-6-deoxyal loside] (6) were isolated. The dichloromethane extract afforded the new diterpene 3,15-dihydroxy-18-norabieta-3,8,11,13-tetraene (7) as well as the new triterpene 2,3,7-trihydroxy-6-oxo-1,3,5(10),7-tetraene-24-nor-friedelane-29-o ic acid methylester (11). The new terpenoids lack cytotoxicity and the antibacterial activity is moderate to low.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of essential oils and ethanol extract of Phlomis fruticosa L. (Lamiaceae).
AB  - The essential oils and an ethanol extract of Phlomis fruticosa L. were evaluated  for antibacterial and antifungal activities. Seven bacterial and seven fungal species were used. Among them were human, animal and plant pathogens, food poisoning bacteria and fungi which are known as potential mycotoxin producers. The essential oils showed antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Micrococcus luteus. The essential oils extracted from the plants collected from two different localities showed similar antibacterial activities. The antifungal activity of the essential oils was positive against Aspergillus niger, A. ochraceus, Cladosporium cladosporioides, Fusarium tricinctum and Phomopsis helianthi. The ethanol extract showed antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis and antifungal activity against Aspergillus niger, A. ochraceus, Cladosporium cladosporioides, Fusarium tricinctum and Phomopsis helianthi.
TI  - Antimicrobial effects of Finnish plant extracts containing flavonoids and other phenolic compounds.
AB  - Plant phenolics, especially dietary flavonoids, are currently of growing interest owing to their supposed functional properties in promoting human health. Antimicrobial screening of 13 phenolic substances and 29 extracts prepared from Finnish plant materials against selected microbes was conducted in this study. The tests were carried out using diffusion methods with four to nine microbial species (Aspergillus niger, Bacillus subtilis, Candida albicans, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis). Flavone, quercetin and naringenin were effective in inhibiting the growth of the organisms. The most active plant extracts were purple loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria L.) against Candida albicans, meadowsweet (Filipendula ulmaria (L.) Maxim.), willow herb (Epilobium angustifolium L.), cloudberry (Rubus chamaemorus L.) and raspberry (Rubus idaeus L.) against bacteria, and white birch (Betula pubescens Ehrh.), pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and potato (Solanum tuberosum. L.) against gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Persistence of infection in mosquitoes injected with bacteria.
AB  
TI  - Purification, characterization, and primary structure of a novel cell wall hydrolytic amidase, CwhA, from Achromobacter lyticus.
AB  - A novel bacteriolytic enzyme CwhA (cell wall hydrolytic amidase) was purified by  ion exchange and gel-filtration chromatographies from a commercial bacteriolytic preparation from Achromobacter lyticus. CwhA exhibited optimal pH at 8.5 and lysed CHCl(3)-treated Escherichia coli more efficiently than Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Pediococcus acidilactici. The enzyme was inhibited by 1,10-phenanthroline strongly and by EDTA to a lesser extent, suggesting that it is probably a metalloenzyme. Amino acid composition and mass spectrometric analyses for the CwhA-derived M. luteus muropeptides revealed that CwhA is N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase [EC 3.5.1. 28]. The complete amino acid sequence of CwhA was established by a combination of Edman degradation and mass spectrometry for peptides obtained by Achromobacter protease I (API) digestion and cyanogen bromide (CNBr) cleavage. The enzyme consists of a single polypeptide chain of 177 amino acid residues with one disulfide bond, Cys114-Cys121. CwhA was found to be homologous to N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase from bacteriophage T7 (BPT7). Its sequence identity with BPT7 is 35%, but the amino acid residues functioning as zinc ligands in BPT7 are absent in CwhA. These results suggest that CwhA is a new type of N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase.
TI  - Design and synthesis of novel antimicrobial pseudopeptides with selective membrane-perturbation activity.
AB  - By incorporating carbamate bond(s) into a cytolytic peptide, novel pseudopeptides with potent antibacterial activity and low hemolytic activity were synthesized. Circular dichroism spectra suggested that the incorporation of carbamate bond(s) decrease the alpha helical conformation of the peptide in lipid membrane circumstances, which must be regarded as a major factor for the separation of antibacterial activity from cytotoxic activity for mammalian cell. Experiments in which dye was released from vesicles indicated that the potent antibacterial activity and low hemolytic activity of the pseudopeptides must be due to their great lipid membrane selectivity. The present result suggest that backbone modifications can be a great tool for developing pseudopeptides with improved biological activity and bioavailability from cytolytic peptides.
TI  - Production of bacteriocin-like metabolites by lactic acid cultures isolated from  sucuk samples.
AB  - A total of 51 sucuk samples, obtained from different regions of Turkey, were examined for lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains producing putative bacteriocin-like metabolites. For detection of antagonistic activity, agar spot and well diffusion assay tests were used. Lactobacillus sake Lb790, Listeria monocytogenes Li6, Staphylococcus aureus St44 and Escherichia coli NRRL B-3704 were used as indicator organisms. Strains having antimicrobial activity were also tested against Clostridium perfringens 4TTK, Clostridium botulinum type A. 7948, Bacillus cereus NRRL B-3711, Micrococcus luteus NRRL B-4376 and Yersinia enterocolitica type 103. 57 of 424 isolates from sucuk samples were putative producers of bacteriocin-like metabolistes and were identified as the following: 19 Lactobacillus plantarum, 4 L. curvatus, 4 Pediococcus pentosaceus, 3 P. acidilactici, 2 L. pentosus, 2 L. sake, 1 L. delbrueckii, 1 L. rhamnosus and 21 unidentified Lactobacillus spp. P. pentosaceus 416, P. acidilactici 413, 419 and 446, L. curvatus 348, L. plantarum 452 and 495, and Lactobacillus spp. 411 strains have the best potential for use as sucuk starter cultures.
TI  - [ATP and polyphosphate-dependent bacterial NAD+-kinases].
AB  - Measurable levels of activity of NAD+ kinases of actinomycetes Micrococcus luteus and Corynebacterium ammoniagenes were observed after substituting inorganic tripolyphosphate for ATP, whereas the enzyme from the eubacterium Escherichia coli was not active with this substrate. Gradient PAGE found two molecular isoforms of NAD+ kinase in C. ammoniagenes and E. coli; four forms were found in M. luteus. All isoforms of this enzyme found in C. ammoniagenes and M. luteus displayed a NADP-synthesizing activity in the presence of either ATP or tripolyphosphate. Because of its capability of utilizing inorganic tripolyphosphate, M. luteus is the most promising NADP producer organism.
TI  - Molecular cloning, expression, and functional analysis of a cis-prenyltransferase from Arabidopsis thaliana. Implications in rubber biosynthesis.
AB  - cis-Prenyltransferase catalyzes the sequential condensation of isopentenyl diphosphate with allylic diphosphate to synthesize polyprenyl diphosphates that play vital roles in cellular activity. Despite potential significance of cis-prenyltransferase in plant growth and development, no gene of the enzyme has been cloned from higher plants. Using sequence information of the conserved region of cis-prenyltransferase cloned recently from Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, and yeast, we have isolated and characterized the first plant cis-prenyltransferase from Arabidopsis thaliana. Sequence analysis revealed that the protein is highly homologous in several conserved regions to cis-prenyltransferases from M. luteus, E. coli, and yeast. In vitro analyses using the recombinant protein overexpressed in E. coli revealed that the enzyme catalyzed the formation of polyprenyl diphosphates ranging in carbon number from 100 to 130 with a predominance of C(120). The enzyme exhibited a higher affinity for farnesyl diphosphate than for geranylgeranyl diphosphate, with the K(m) values being 0.13 and 3.62 micrometer, respectively, but a lower affinity for isopentenyl diphosphate, with a K(m) value of 23 micrometer. In vitro rubber biosynthesis analysis indicated that the Arabidopsis cis-prenyltransferase itself could not catalyze the formation of higher molecular weight polyprenyl diphosphates similar to natural rubber. A reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that the gene was expressed at low levels in Arabidopsis plant, in which expression of the cis-prenyltransferase in leaf and root was higher than that in stem, flower, and silique. These results indicate the tissue-specific expression of cis-prenyltransferase and suggest a potential role and significance of the enzyme in the polyisoprenoid biosynthesis in plants.
TI  - Amplifiable DNA from gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria by a low strength pulsed electric field method.
AB  - An efficient electric field-based procedure for cell disruption and DNA isolation is described. Isoosmotic suspensions of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria were treated with pulsed electric fields of <60 V/cm. Pulses had an exponential decay waveform with a time constant of 3.4 micros. DNA yield was linearly dependent on time or pulse number, with several thousand pulses needed. Electrochemical side-effects and electrophoresis were minimal. The lysates contained non-fragmented DNA which was readily amplifiable by PCR. As the method was not limited to samples of high specific resistance, it should be applicable to physiological fluids and be useful for genomic and DNA diagnostic applications.
TI  - Purification and characterization of chitin-binding proteins from the hemolymph of sweet potato hornworm, Agrius convolvuli.
AB  - Three chitin-binding proteins (CBPs: CBP9, CBP15, CBP66) were identified from the larval hemolymph of sweet potato hornworm, Agrius convolvuli. Two (CBP9 and CBP15) of them have been isolated and purified by gel filtration (Superdex HR 75), cation-exchange chromatography (Mono S), and reverse-phase chromatography (muRPC PC 2.1/3). In experiments to detect CBPs in hemolymph, we examined whether ionic strength and existence of bovine serum albumin in the incubation solution influenced binding affinity of CBPs to chitin. The N-terminal sequences of three CBPs were determined by the automated Edman degradation and showed the sequence homology in basic local alignment search tool search CBP15 and CBP66 were quite similar to lysozymes and bovine serum albumins, respectively. In contrast, CBP9 is not similar to any other known protein, as judged from databank comparisons. Therefore, we concluded that CBP9 is a novel protein with binding capacity to chitin that is a component of the fungal cell wall. CBP9 has no antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli and Micrococcus luteus, and also showed negative response in hemagglutination assay. CBP9 is confirmed as a monomer with a molecular mass of 9.14 kDa by electron spray ionization and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry.
TI  - Androctonin, a hydrophilic disulphide-bridged non-haemolytic anti-microbial peptide: a plausible mode of action.
AB  - Androctonin is a 25-residue non-haemolytic anti-microbial peptide isolated from the scorpion Androctonus australis and contains two disulphide bridges. Androctonin is different from known native anti-microbial peptides, being a relatively hydrophilic and non-amphipathic molecule. This raises the possibility that the target of androctonin might not be the bacterial membrane, shown to be a target for most amphipathic lytic peptides. To shed light on its mode of action on bacteria and its non-haemolytic activity, we synthesized androctonin, its fluorescent derivatives and its all-D-amino acid enantiomer. The enantiomer preserved high activity, suggesting a lipid-peptide interaction between androctonin and bacterial membranes. In Gram-positive and (at higher concentrations) Gram-negative bacteria, androctonin induced an immediate perturbation of the permeability properties of the cytoplasmic membrane of the bacterial energetic state, concomitant with perturbation of the morphology of the cell envelope as revealed by electron microscopy. Androctonin binds only to negatively charged lipid vesicles and induces the leakage of markers at high concentrations and with a slow kinetics, in contrast with amphipathic alpha-helical anti-microbial peptides that bind and permeate negatively charged vesicles, and to a smaller extent also zwitterionic ones. This might explain the selective lytic activity of androctonin towards bacteria but not red blood cells. Polarized attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy revealed that androctonin adopts a beta-sheet structure in membranes and did not affect the lipid acyl chain order, which supports a detergent-like effect. The small size of androctonin, its hydrophilic character and its physicochemical properties are favourable features for its potential application as a replacement for commercially available antibiotics to which bacteria have developed resistance.
TI  - Effect of chelators and nisin produced in situ on inhibition and inactivation of  gram negatives.
AB  - The ability of chelators and nisin generated in situ to inhibit and inactivate E. coli and other gram negatives in a model substrate was investigated. The effect of various chelators and different concentrations of exogenous nisin on inhibition of E. coli in broth medium showed that only EDTA and pyrophosphates were able to cause appreciable inhibition of E. coli by nisin. In a broth where L. lactis NCFB 497 produced nisin in a concentration of 250-300 IU/ml, pyrophosphates were unable to inactivate E. coli. Under the same conditions, addition of EDTA led to inactivation of E. coli at neutral and slightly acidic pH only. A cocktail of strains of E. coli was less sensitive than E. coli ATCC 25922 alone. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was more sensitive and salmonellae more resistant. EDTA also caused a slight reduction in the L. lactis population and its biochemical activity as regards pH drop and acid production. Some of the inhibition of E. coli could be ascribed to the physical presence of Lactococcus cells rather than their metabolites excreted into the medium. Failure to observe any inhibition in fermented broths at their natural pH (4.0) was ascribed to the poor chelating power of EDTA under acid conditions.
TI  - Purification and partial characterization of a murein hydrolase, millericin B, produced by Streptococcus milleri NMSCC 061.
AB  - Streptococcus milleri NMSCC 061 was screened for antimicrobial substances and shown to produce a bacteriolytic cell wall hydrolase, termed millericin B. The enzyme was purified to homogeneity by a four-step purification procedure that consisted of ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by gel filtration, ultrafiltration, and ion-exchange chromatography. The yield following ion-exchange chromatography was 6.4%, with a greater-than-2,000-fold increase in specific activity. The molecular weight of the enzyme was 28,924 as determined by electrospray mass spectrometry. The amino acid sequences of both the N terminus of the enzyme (NH(2) SENDFSLAMVSN) and an internal fragment which was generated by cyanogen bromide cleavage (NH(2) SIQTNAPWGL) were determined by automated Edman degradation. Millericin B displayed a broad spectrum of activity against gram-positive bacteria but was not active against Bacillus subtilis W23 or Escherichia coli ATCC 486 or against the producer strain itself. N-Dinitrophenyl derivatization and hydrazine hydrolysis of free amino and free carboxyl groups liberated from peptidoglycan digested with millericin B followed by thin-layer chromatography showed millericin B to be an endopeptidase with multiple activities. It cleaves the stem peptide at the N terminus of glutamic acid as well as the N terminus of the last residue in the interpeptide cross-link of susceptible strains.
TI  - Variable selection and multivariate methods for the identification of microorganisms by flow cytometry.
AB  - BACKGROUND: When exploited fully, flow cytometry can be used to provide multiparametric data for each cell in the sample of interest. While this makes flow cytometry a powerful technique for discriminating between different cell types, the data can be difficult to interpret. Traditionally, dual-parameter plots are used to visualize flow cytometric data, and for a data set consisting of seven parameters, one should examine 21 of these plots. A more efficient method is to reduce the dimensionality of the data (e.g., using unsupervised methods such as principal components analysis) so that fewer graphs need to be examined, or to use supervised multivariate data analysis methods to give a prediction of the identity of the analyzed particles. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We collected multiparametric data sets for microbiological samples stained with six cocktails of fluorescent stains. Multivariate data analysis methods were explored as a means of microbial detection and identification. RESULTS: We show that while all cocktails and all methods gave good accuracy of predictions (>94%), careful selection of both the stains and the analysis method could improve this figure (to > 99% accuracy), even in a data set that was not used in the formation of the supervised multivariate calibration model. CONCLUSIONS: Flow cytometry provides a rapid method of obtaining multiparametric data for distinguishing between microorganisms. Multivariate data analysis methods have an important role to play in extracting the information from the data obtained. Artificial neural networks proved to be the most suitable method of data analysis.
TI  - Molecular analysis of prenyl chain elongating enzymes.
AB  - Multiple alignments of primary structures of many kinds of prenyltransferases that participate in the most fundamental prenyl-chain backbone synthesizing process in isoprenoid biosynthesis showed seven conserved regions in the primary structures of (E)-prenyl diphosphate synthases. However, no information has been available about the structures of (Z)-prenyl diphosphate synthases until our recent isolation of the gene for the undecaprenyl diphosphate synthase of Micrococcus luteus B-P 26. The amino acid sequence of the (Z)-prenyl diphosphate synthase is totally different from those of (E)-prenyl chain elongating enzymes. Protein data base searches for sequences similar to that of the undecaprenyl diphosphate synthase yielded many unknown proteins which have not yet been characterized. Two of the proteins have recently been identified as the undecaprenyl diphosphate synthase of Escherichia coli and the dehydrodolichyl diphosphate synthase of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, indicating that there are three highly conserved regions in the primary structure of (Z)-prenyl chain elongating enzymes.
TI  - Dependence of the Raman signature of genomic B-DNA on nucleotide base sequence.
AB  - The vibrational spectra of four genomic and two synthetic DNAs, encompassing a wide range in base composition [poly(dA-dT). poly(dA-dT), 0% G + C; Clostridium perfringens DNA, 27% G + C; calf thymus DNA, 42% G + C; Escherichia coli DNA, 50% G + C; Micrococcus luteus DNA, 72% G + C; poly(dG-dC).poly(dG-dC), 100% G + C] (dA: deoxyadenosine; dG: deoxyguanosine; dC: deoxycytidine; dT: thymidine), have been analyzed using Raman difference methods of high sensitivity. The results show that the Raman signature of B DNA depends in detail upon both genomic base composition and sequence. Raman bands assigned to vibrational modes of the deoxyribose-phosphate backbone are among the most sensitive to base sequence, indicating that within the B family of conformations major differences occur in the backbone geometry of AT- and GC-rich domains. Raman bands assigned to in-plane vibrations of the purine and pyrimidine bases-particularly of A and T-exhibit large deviations from the patterns expected for random base distributions, establishing that Raman hypochromic effects in genomic DNA are also highly sequence dependent. The present study provides a basis for future use of Raman spectroscopy to analyze sequence-specific DNA-ligand interactions. The demonstration of sequence dependency in the Raman spectrum of genomic B DNA also implies the capability to distinguish genomic DNAs by means of their characteristic Raman signatures.
TI  - Constitutive activation of toll-mediated antifungal defense in serpin-deficient Drosophila.
AB  - The antifungal defense of Drosophila is controlled by the spaetzle/Toll/cactus gene cassette. Here, a loss-of-function mutation in the gene encoding a blood serine protease inhibitor, Spn43Ac, was shown to lead to constitutive expression of the antifungal peptide drosomycin, and this effect was mediated by the spaetzle and Toll gene products. Spaetzle was cleaved by proteolytic enzymes to its active ligand form shortly after immune challenge, and cleaved Spaetzle was constitutively present in Spn43Ac-deficient flies. Hence, Spn43Ac negatively regulates the Toll signaling pathway, and Toll does not function as a pattern recognition receptor in the Drosophila host defense.
TI  - Synthesis of pyrazolidinone antibacterial agents.
AB  - The synthesis of monocyclic pyrazolidinones, which show moderate antibacterial activity, are described.
TI  - Formation and structure of mixed bacterial communities.
AB  - Mixed bacterial communities are formed by unrelated bacteria on solid media. Mixed bacterial communities on solid media are similar to "classical" colonies and are formed after the growth of a large number of unrelated bacteria simultaneously plated onto a limited area of agar. The morphology of the mixed bacterial communities was similar for different combinations of bacteria and did not change when the bacteria were plated on different media. Different bacterial strains form zones of individual and mixed growth in the structure of mixed bacterial communities. The results of electron microscopic examination indicate that mixed bacterial communities are isolated from their external environment by a surface film. The basic part of this film is formed by an elementary membrane. The membrane of the surface film of mixed bacterial communities is a stable structure occupying a large surface area. The results of this investigation seem to indicate the existence of a special type of co-operation between different species of bacteria. This type of co-operation may be very important in the regulation of interactions between different bacteria and between bacteria and the environment.
TI  - Gram positive bacteria induce IL-6 and IL-8 production in human alveolar macrophages and epithelial cells.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Inhalation of dust from swine confinement buildings results in an acute inflammatory reaction in the respiratory tract. The dust has a high microbial content, dominated by Gram positive bacteria. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the significance of bacteria in the induction of IL-6 and IL-8 release from respiratory epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages. The results would give an indication to what extent the bacteria contribute to the toxic inflammation following exposure to swine dust. METHODS: Epithelial cells from a human lung carcinoma cell line (A549) and human alveolar macrophages obtained from healthy subjects by bronchoalveolar lavage, were stimulated with swine dust, LPS, one Gram negative and four Gram positive bacteria strains. The dose-response release of IL-6 and IL-8 were studied. In addition, a bacteria-free supernatant was prepared from each strain and used for stimulation. RESULTS: With a few exceptions, a dose-dependent IL-6 and IL-8 release was demonstrated from both cell types after stimulation with bacteria. In epithelial cells, Escherichia coli was the most potent bacteria at the highest concentration of 400 bacteria/cell regarding secretion of both IL-6 and IL-8 (P < 0.001), followed by Staphylococcus hominis and Staphylococcus lentus. In alveolar macrophages, S. lentus was the most potent strain (P < 0.001) in inducing cytokine release (P < 0.001), followed by S. hominis and E. coli concerning IL-6 secretion or Micrococcus luteus and E. coli with respect to IL-8 secretion (P < 0.001). Differences in potency between the various bacteria could be demonstrated, both within the two cell types as well as between the epithelial cells and macrophages. Bacteria-free supernatants were also able to induce cytokine release in both cell types. In macrophages the supernatants were even more potent stimuli than whole bacteria. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that bacteria or bacterial products could be an important contributing factor to the inflammatory reaction following exposure to swine dust.
TI  - Isolation and purification of a Campylobacter upsaliensis autolysin.
AB  - Autolytic activity in the soluble and sediment fractions of sonicates of the spiral and the coccoid form of Campylobacter upsaliensis could not be demonstrated by native (nondenaturing) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). Autolysins were detected, however, by using denaturing sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-PAGE gels containing either purified Escherichia coli peptidoglycan or whole cells of Micrococcus luteus (Micrococcus lysodeikticus) as the turbid substrate, with subsequent renaturation by treatment with Triton X-100 buffer. In renaturing gels that contained Escherichia coli peptidoglycan, 14 putative autolytic bands ranging from 200 to 12 kDa were detected. In similar gels containing whole cells of M. luteus, only a single band appeared with a molecular mass of 34 kDa. This band corresponded to one of the bands present in the gels containing Escherichia coli peptidoglycan. This common autolysin was isolated by adsorbing it from Campylobacter upsaliensis soluble fractions onto M. luteus cells and then subjecting these cells to renaturing SDS-PAGE in gels containing Escherichia coli peptidoglycan. The 34-kDa autolysin differed from a single 51-kDa autolysin unique to the M. luteus cells, and when isolated from an SDS-PAGE gel, was pure when tested by isoelectric focusing. The N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis showed the first 15 amino acids of the 34-kDa autolysin to have 67% identity to a part of antigenic protein PEB4 of Campylobacter jejuni. The purified autolysin was used to immunize rabbits and the antibodies produced precipitated autolytic activity from cell lysates. The specificity of the antibodies was shown by Western blotting: only a single specific band occurred, with a molecular mass of 34 kDa, and thus it seems unlikely that the 34-kDa autolysin was derived from any of the other autolysins that were detected.
TI  - The Escherichia coli homologue of yeast RER2, a key enzyme of dolichol synthesis, is essential for carrier lipid formation in bacterial cell wall synthesis.
AB  - We found in the Escherichia coli genome sequence a homologue of RER2, a Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene required for proper localization of an endoplasmic reticulum protein, and designated it rth (RER2 homologue). The disruption of this gene was lethal for E. coli. To reveal its biological function, we isolated temperature-sensitive mutants of the rth gene. The mutant cells became swollen and burst at the nonpermissive temperature, indicating that their cell wall integrity was defective. Further analysis showed that the mutant cells were deficient in the activity of cis-prenyltransferase, namely, undecaprenyl diphosphate synthase, a key enzyme of the carrier lipid formation of peptidoglycan synthesis. The cellular level of undecaprenyl phosphate was in fact markedly decreased in the mutants. These results are consistent with the fact that the Rer2 homologue of Micrococcus luteus shows undecaprenyl diphosphate synthase activity (N. Shimizu, T. Koyama, and K. Ogura, J. Biol. Chem. 273:19476-19481, 1998) and demonstrate that E. coli Rth is indeed responsible for the maintenance of cell wall rigidity. Our work on the yeast rer2 mutants shows that they are defective in the activity of cis-prenyltransferase, namely, dehydrodolichyl diphosphate synthase, a key enzyme of dolichol synthesis. Taking these data together, we conclude that the RER2 gene family encodes cis-prenyltransferase, which plays an essential role in cell wall biosynthesis in bacteria and in dolichol synthesis in eukaryotic cells and has been well conserved during evolution.
TI  - Macromolecular antimicrobial glycoprotein, achacin, expressed in a methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris.
AB  - A cDNA encoding achacin, an antimicrobial glycoprotein from the body surface mucus of giant African snail Achacina fulica Ferussac, was expressed in a methylotrophic yeast, Pichia pastoris, and recombinant achacin (rAch) was secreted in yeast minimal medium in a polyglycosylated form with 80 kDa. Carbohydrate analysis revealed that the glycosylated moiety of rAch was composed of 50 mol mannose and 2 mol N-acetylglucosamine residues. Antimicrobial activity using Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus showed that the rAch had a behavior similar to its native counterpart. The rAch showed so wide an antimicrobial spectrum that 0.1 mg/ml rAch inhibited the growth of Pseudomonas fluorescens, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus faecalis in addition to E. coli and S. aureus, whereas it did not appreciably affect the growth of Proteus mirabilis, Bacillus cereus and Micrococcus luteus. The rAch was also effective in preventing growth of Vibrio anguillarum and Vibrio parahaemolyticus. The results suggested that the rAch had great potential of using as an antimicrobial agent.
TI  - Insect immunity. Isolation from the lepidopteran Heliothis virescens of a novel insect defensin with potent antifungal activity.
AB  - Lepidoptera have been reported to produce several antibacterial peptides in response to septic injury. However, in marked contrast to other insect groups, no inducible antifungal molecules had been described so far in this insect order. Surprisingly, also cysteine-rich antimicrobial peptides, which predominate in the antimicrobial defense of other insects, had not been discovered in Lepidoptera. Here we report the isolation from the hemolymph of immune induced larvae of the lepidopteran Heliothis virescens of a cysteine-rich molecule with exclusive antifungal activity. We have fully characterized this antifungal molecule, which has significant homology with the insect defensins, a large family of antibacterial peptides directed against Gram-positive strains. Interestingly, the novel peptide shows also similarities with the antifungal peptide drosomycin from Drosophila. Thus, Lepidoptera appear to have built their humoral immune response against bacteria on cecropins and attacins. In addition, we report that Lepidoptera have conferred antifungal properties to the well conserved structure of antibacterial insect defensins through amino acid replacements.
TI  - Successful parasitation of locusts by entomopathogenic nematodes is correlated with inhibition of insect phagocytes.
AB  - The entomopathogenic nematodes Heterorhabditis megidis and Steinernema feltiae turned out to be successful antagonists of the orthopteran insects Locusta migratoria and Schistocerca gregaria. The death rate of locusts maintained on nematode-inoculated sand was remarkably high. Even dosages as low as one nematode per cubic centimeter of sand killed approximately 50% of the locusts within 10 days. The impact of parasitation on locusts' immune defense was closely investigated for L. migratoria parasitized by H. megidis. Adult locusts died within 30-35 h after being fed with 50 infective H. megidis juveniles. Within the first 30 h after ingestion of the nematodes, locust hemolymph was assayed for alterations in the humoral and cellular defense components and for the presence of the nematode-associated Photorhabdus luminescens bacteria. Humoral defense was generally low without any correlation to the state of parasitation. There was no detectable activity against Escherichia coli and only little lysozyme-like activity against Micrococcus luteus. In contrast, cellular defense components were strongly influenced by parasitation. Most interestingly, the phagocytic capacity of the hemocytes was already hampered 12 h after oral application of the nematodes, whereas considerable hemocyte death occurred not earlier than 24 h after feeding. The nematode-associated bacteria could be detected in hemolymph of some of the nematode-fed locusts as early as 3 h after feeding and in all hemolymph samples after 24 h. Supernatants from isolated P. luminescens cultures were able to inhibit the L. migratoria phagocytes in vitro; thus the successful parasitation appears to be dependent on an inhibition by bacteria-released compounds rather than on overloading or simply killing of the phagocytic active hemocytes.
TI  - Overexpression of salt-tolerant glutaminase from Micrococcus luteus K-3 in Escherichia coli and its purification.
AB  - A high-expression plasmid, pKSGHE3-1, containing the salt-tolerant glutaminase (EC 3.5.1.2) from marine bacterium Micrococcus luteus K-3 was constructed. pKSGHE3-1 was made by inserting the DNA fragment (1.43 kb) containing the structural gene synthesized by polymerase chain reaction into the downstream region of the tac promoter of expression vector pKK223-3. The translational start codon was located 10 bases downstream of the Shine-Dalgarno sequence (AGGA) of pKK223-3. Escherichia coli JM109 transformed with pKSGHE3-1 exhibited more than 190-fold higher glutaminase activity than M. luteus K-3 under optimal culture conditions. The enzyme was purified to homogeneity through three column chromatography steps with a final yield of 17.1%. The recombinant enzyme showed the same enzymatic properties, including salt tolerance, as those of M. luteus K-3. This glutaminase expression system allows the production of sufficient quantities of glutaminase for basic structure-function studies including chemical modification and future X-ray crystallization analysis.
TI  - Suitability of the Charm HVS and a microbiological multiplate system for detection of residues in raw milk at EU maximum residue levels.
AB  - In this paper we assessed the suitability of the Charm HVS and a newly developed  microbiological multiplate system as post-screening tests to confirm the presence of residues in raw milk at or near the maximum permissible residue level (MRL). The multiplate system is composed of Bacillus stearothermophilus var. calidolactis plate at pH 8.0 for detection of beta-lactam antibiotics and tylosin, Bacillus cereus plate at pH 6.0 for detection of tetracyclines, Micrococcus luteus plate at pH 8.0 for detection of macrolides, Bacillus subtilis BGA plate at pH 8.0 for detection of aminoglycosides, trimethoprim-containing plate seeded with B. subtilis BGA at pH 7.0 for detection of sulphonamides, Escherichia coli plate at pH 6.0 for detection of quinolone and polymyxin, and Staphylococcus epidermidis plate at pH 6.0 for detection of novobiocin. For each test plate an action level is proposed in such a way that residues can be detected in raw bulk tank milk at levels near or below the established EU MRLs of beta-lactam antibiotics, tetracyclines, aminoglycosides, macrolides, sulphonamides, colistin, and quinolones. The Charm HVS test used to confirm the presence of tetracycline and macrolide residues gave false-positive results near the EU MRLs. The multiplate system gave valid results. Based on data for raw bulk tank milk samples and the proposed action level for each test plate for suspected samples, we demonstrated that the multiplate system is a reliable post-screening method that can be performed easily and cheaply in microbiological laboratories.
TI  - Mosquito-Plasmodium interactions in response to immune activation of the vector.
AB  - During the development of Plasmodium sp. within the mosquito midgut, the parasite undergoes a series of developmental changes. The elongated ookinete migrates through the layers of the midgut where it forms the oocyst under the basal lamina. We demonstrate here that if Aedes aegypti or Anopheles gambiae, normally susceptible to Plasmodium gallinaceum and P. berghei, respectively, are immune activated by the injection of bacteria into the hemocoel, and subsequently are fed on an infectious bloodmeal, there is a significant reduction in the prevalence and mean intensity of infection of oocysts on the midgut. Only those mosquitoes immune activated prior to, or immediately after, parasite ingestion exhibit this reduction in parasite development. Mosquitoes immune activated 2-5 days after bloodfeeding show no differences in parasite burdens compared with naive controls. Northern analyses reveal that transcriptional activity for mosquito defensins is not detected in the whole bodies of Ae. aegypti from 4 h to 10 days after ingesting P. gallinaceum, suggesting that parasite ingestion, passage from the food bolus through the midgut, oocyst formation, and subsequent release of sporozoites into the hemolymph do not induce the production of defensin. However, reverse transcriptase-PCR of RNA isolated solely from the midguts of Ae. aegypti indicates that transcription of mosquito defensins occurs in the midguts of naive mosquitoes and those ingesting an infectious or noninfectious bloodmeal. Bacteria-challenged Ae. aegypti showed high levels of mature defensin in the hemolymph that correlate with a lower prevalence and mean intensity of infection with oocysts. Because few oocysts were found on the midgut of immune-activated mosquitoes, the data suggest that some factor, induced by bacterial challenge, kills the parasite at a preoocyst stage.
TI  - Which conditions promote a remanent (persistent) bactericidal activity of chlorine covers?
AB  - The interaction of disinfectants containing active chlorine compounds (hypochlorite, chloramine T) with skin surfaces produces a so called chlorine cover which is a true chemical transformation of the protein matrix of the outermost horny skin layer by forming covalent N-Cl bonds. Though its intensity can easily be measured, the results on its remanent (persistent) bactericidal action until now have not been described consistently. While Gottardi and Karl observed a well-defined remanent action which correlated with the cover strength in the artificially with E. coli contaminated arm, Koller, Rotter, and Gottardi were not able to prove it, neither in artificially contaminated hands nor in the case of the resident bacterial colonization. To clarify these not consistent results, the bactericidal activity of chlorine covers on transient (dry contamination of the finger tips with Micrococcus luteus) as well as on resident colonization (after wearing gloves for 3 h) has been re-investigated using contact plates for recovering the bacteria. The results are showing that the remanent bactericidal action of chlorine covers strongly depends on the skin milieu, with moist conditions caused by sweat (surgical gloves) favoring the bactericidal activity. Elution experiments prove that protein constituents (detected by UV-spectrometry) continuously are transported to the skin-surface. It is obvious that the latter equilibrate with the chlorine cover by forming bactericidal N-Cl compounds with the effect that oxidation capacity fixed at the protein matrix is mobilized enabling the remanent bactericidal action.
TI  - Analysis of the Drosophila host defense in domino mutant larvae, which are devoid of hemocytes.
AB  - We have analyzed the Drosophila immune response in domino mutant larvae, which are devoid of blood cells. The domino mutants have a good larval viability, but they die as prepupae. We show that, on immune challenge, induction of the genes encoding antimicrobial peptides in the fat body is not affected significantly in the mutant larvae, indicating that hemocytes are not essential in this process. The hemocoele of domino larvae contains numerous live microorganisms, the presence of which induces a weak antimicrobial response in the fat body. A full response is observed only after septic injury. We propose that the fat body cells are activated both by the presence of microorganisms and by injury and that injury potentiates the effect of microorganisms. Survival experiments after an immune challenge showed that domino mutants devoid of blood cells maintain a wild-type resistance to septic injury. This resistance was also observed in mutant larvae in which the synthesis of antibacterial peptides is impaired (immune deficiency larvae) and in mutants that are deficient for humoral melanization (Black cells larvae). However, if domino was combined with either the immune deficiency or the Black cell mutation, the resistance to septic injury was reduced severely. These results establish the relevance of the three immune reactions: phagocytosis, synthesis of antibacterial peptides, and melanization. By working in synergy, they provide Drosophila a highly effective defense against injury and/or infection.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of exocrine glandular secretions, hemolymph, and larval regurgitate of the mustard leaf beetle phaedon cochleariae
AB  - Larvae and adults of the mustard leaf beetle Phaedon cochleariae (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) possess exocrine glands with secretions which are used in defense against predators. This study addressed the question whether these defensive secretions also display antimicrobial activity. Additionally, the effects of larval and adult hemolymph and larval regurgitate toward microorganisms were examined. The larval glandular secretion showed growth-inhibitory activity against the gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli, but no lytic effect against cell walls of the gram-positive bacterium Micrococcus luteus. Growth of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and of the entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana was also inhibited by the larval secretion. The antibacterial and antifungal activity of the larval secretion was found to be due to its main component, the iridoid monoterpene, (epi)chrysomelidial. The mechanism of its antifungal activity was examined by different bioassays and compared to the commercially available fungicide nystatin. The antifungal activity of the larval secretion is not due to a loss of intracellular potassium in treated fungal cells, while high potassium efflux from treated cells is the mode of action of common fungicides. The larval secretion exhibited direct cytotoxicity against both fungal cells and plasmatocytes isolated from the greater wax moth Galleria mellonella. In contrast to the larval secretion, the adult glandular secretion of P. cochleariae showed lytic activity against the cell walls of the gram-positive bacterium M. luteus, but no activity against the gram-negative bacterium E. coli and eukaryotic cells. Hemolymph and larval regurgitate of P. cochleariae displayed the same activity as the tested glandular secretion of adults. Copyright 1998 Academic Press.
TI  - Intersubunit structure within heterodimers of medium-chain prenyl diphosphate synthases. Formation of a hybrid-type heptaprenyl diphosphate synthase.
AB  - Among prenyltransferases that catalyze the sequential condensation of isopentenyl diphosphate with allylic diphosphate to produce prenyl diphosphates with various chain lengths and stereochemistries, medium-chain prenyl diphosphate synthases are exceptional in that they comprise two dissociable heteromeric protein components. These components exist without binding with each other under physiological conditions, and neither of them has any prenyltransferase activity by itself. In order to elucidate the precise molecular mechanism underlying expression of the catalytic function by such a unique two-component system, we examined the possibility of forming a hybrid between two of the components of three different medium-chain prenyl diphosphate synthases, components I and II of heptaprenyl diphosphate synthase from Bacillus subtilis, components I' and II' of heptaprenyl diphosphate synthase from Bacillus stearothermophilus, and components A and B of hexaprenyl diphosphate synthase from Micrococcus luteus B-P 26. As a result, only the hybrid-type combination of component I and component II' gave distinct prenyltransferase activity. The hybrid-type enzyme catalyzed the synthesis of heptaprenyl diphosphate and showed moderate heat stability, which lay between those of the natural enzymes from B. subtilis and B. stearothermophilus. There is no possibility of forming a hybrid between the heptaprenyl and hexaprenyl diphosphate synthases.
TI  - Molecular cloning, expression, and purification of undecaprenyl diphosphate synthase. No sequence similarity between E- and Z-prenyl diphosphate synthases.
AB  - Cloning of the gene for undecaprenyl diphosphate synthase was successful, providing the first primary structure for any prenyltransferase that catalyzes Z-prenyl chain elongation. A genomic DNA library of Micrococcus luteus B-P 26 was constructed in Escherichia coli, and the recombinant clones were grown on nylon membranes. The membrane was incubated directly by floating it on a reaction mixture containing radiolabeled isopentenyl diphosphate, nonlabeled farnesyl diphosphate, and Mg2+. Only the clones harboring plasmids encoding prenyltransferases could take up the substrates to synthesize and accumulate radiolabeled products inside the cells in amounts large enough to be detectable by autoradiography. Four positive colonies were found among about 4,000 bacterial colonies of the genomic DNA library. Two of them carried the gene for undecaprenyl diphosphate synthase, which catalyzes the Z-prenyl chain elongation, and the others carried the (all-E)-hexaprenyl diphosphate synthase genes (hexs-a and hexs-b; Shimizu, N., Koyama, T., and Ogura, K. (1998) J. Bacteriol. 180, 1578-1581). The undecaprenyl diphosphate synthase, which had a predicted molecular mass of 28.9 kDa, was overproduced in E. coli cells by applying a soluble expression system, and it was purified to near homogeneity. The deduced primary structure of the Z-prenyl chain-elongating enzyme is totally different from those of E-prenyl chain-elongating enzymes, which have characteristic conserved regions, including aspartate-rich motifs.
TI  - Filarial DNA and its interaction with polyamines and antifilarial drugs.
AB  - The interaction of DNA from filarial parasite Setaria cervi with polyamines was monitored by melting temperature (Tm) profile, condensation and B to Z DNA transition and compared with DNA of Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus and calf thymus having different GC content. Polyamines, viz. spermine and spermidine, stabilized the secondary structure of all DNAs as indicated by increase in Tm value. UV absorption studies indicated B to Z DNA transition in the presence of polyamines. The amount of polyamines required for B to Z transition was dependent upon base composition of DNA and charge of the polyamine. Filarial DNA (AT rich) required six times higher concentration of spermine as compared to GC rich DNA for B to Z DNA transition. Spermidine was not effective in causing transition of S. cervi DNA even at Spd:DNA-P ratio of 20. The antifilarial compound suramin significantly decreased melting temperature of filarial DNA as compared to GC rich DNAs of other parasites. Suramin adversely affected condensation and B to Z DNA transition of various DNAs but prior addition of polyamines protected the DNAs from the destabilizing effect of suramin.
TI  - In vitro determination of direct antimicrobial effect of calcium hydroxide.
AB  - The objective of this study was to determine in vitro the time required for calcium hydroxide in direct contact with microorganisms to express its antimicrobial effect. The microorganisms used were: Micrococcus luteus (ATCC-9341), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC-6538), Fusobacterium nucleatum (ATCC-25586), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC-27853), Escherichia coli, and Streptococcus sp. The strains were cultivated in Brain Heart Infusion (BHI), with the exception of F. nucleatum (BHI-PRAS). Pure and mixed suspensions of the microorganisms were prepared. Paper cones immersed in these substances were covered with calcium hydroxide paste, and after 0, 1, 2, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h and 7 days they were transferred to an appropriate medium to observe the growth and multiplication of the microorganisms. Incubation was conducted at 37 degrees C for 48 h, according to the requirements of oxygen of each microorganism. The antimicrobial effect of calcium hydroxide was shown to occur after 12 h on M. luteus and F. nucleatum, 24 h on Streptococcus sp, 48 h on E. coli, and 72 h on S. aureus and P. aeruginosa. Mixture II (M. luteus + Streptococcus sp + S. aureus) was sensitive to calcium hydroxide antimicrobial potential after 48 h, whereas mixture I (M. luteus + E. coli + P. aeruginosa), mixture III (E. coli + P. aeruginosa), and mixture IV (S. aureus + P. aeruginosa) were inactivated after 72 h of exposure.
TI  - The sandfly Lutzomyia longipalpis shows specific humoral responses to bacterial challenge.
AB  - The presence of immune molecules induced by microorganisms in the haemolymph of Lutzomyia longipalpis sandflies has been investigated. Injections of Escherichia coli and Micrococcus luteus into female sandflies induced anti-bacterial activity in the haemolymph. Inhibition zone assays showed that haemolymph from E. coli and M.luteus injected sandflies differentially inhibited M.luteus growth. This differential effect was specific to M.luteus infection since anti-E.coli activity was similar in haemolymph from both E.coli or M.luteus injected sandflies. Haemolymph following injection of either bacteria showed the induction of a 4 kDa peptide. Haemolymph from M.luteus injected sandflies also contained a 33 kDa polypeptide which was absent in haemolymph from E.coli and control uninfected insects. Sandflies, in common with other insects, were shown to possess general and specific humoral immune responses to the presence of microorganisms.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of an antibiotic produced by the scab disease-suppressive Streptomyces diastatochromogenes strain PonSSII.
AB  - An antibiotic produced by the scab disease-suppressive Streptomyces diastatochromogenes strain PonSSII has been isolated and partially characterized. The antibiotic is produced throughout culture growth, with maximum amounts accumulating in the broth when the culture is in the early stationary phase of growth. The activity declines within about 30 h after the culture enters stationary phase. Purification techniques included chromatography on Amberlite XAD-2, DEAE Sephadex and SP Sephadex in addition to C18 HPLC with an average yield of 75%. This antibiotic only inhibits pathogenic strains of S. scabies that cause scab disease on potato and other tuberous vegetables and does not affect S. griseus, S. venezuelae, Actinomyces bovis, Nocardia asteroides, Clostridium perfringens, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Micrococcus luteus, Serratia marcescens and Escherichia coli. The antibiotic has a molecular weight of 500 or less, and is stable for weeks at acidic pH but is very labile at alkaline pH conditions.
TI  - Fluorescent brighteners: novel stains for the flow cytometric analysis of microorganisms.
AB  - Flow cytometry is a rapid method for measuring the optical properties of individual cells. The technique has found great utility in the study of mammalian cells, but microbiological applications have been more limited. We here show that UV-excited fluorescent whitening agents, in particular Tinopal CBS-X, are effective stains for both vegetative microbial cells and for spores of Gram-positive bacteria. Pretreatment of samples with ethanol speeds the staining process. Under favourable conditions, Tinopal CBS-X may be used to discriminate among organisms, a fact that may be useful when screening for a target microorganism against a high biological background.
TI  - Cloning and expression of a gene encoding Moraxella sp. CK-1 autolysin.
AB  - A gene of Moraxella sp. CK-1 encoding cell wall lytic activity has been cloned and expressed in E. coli. A genomic library of Moraxella sp. CK-1 was constructed in the multifunctional phagemid vector pT7T3 19u, with partial Sau3A digests of Moraxella sp. CK-1 genomic DNA inserted at the BamHI restriction site. Screening of about 5,000 transformants for cell lysis activity in LB agar plates containing Micrococcus Iuteus cells gave one positive clone harboring the 3.7 kb insert (pMXA282). Restriction mapping and deletion analysis of the recombinant plasmid carrying a 3.7 kb insert suggested that the autolysin gene was located within a 1.1 kb BamHI-PstI fragment. Analysis of extracts of E. coli clone harboring recombinant plasmids on renaturing SDS-polyacrylamide gels containing heat-killed Micrococcus luteus cells showed a clear zone around a polypeptide of about 32 kDa. Lytic activity against Micrococcus luteus cell walls by the cloned autolysin was maximum at pH 9.0. Even in conditions of over pH 10.0, this cloned autolysin showed a vigrous lytic activity. Southern blot analysis suggested the existence of other homologous regions in Moraxella sp. CK-1 genome.
TI  - Novel antibacterial peptides isolated from a European bumblebee, Bombus pascuorum (Hymenoptera, Apoidea).
AB  - We present here the isolation and characterization of four antimicrobial peptides produced by a European bumblebee Bombus pascuorum. A 51-residue insect defensin was characterized which, like the Apis mellifera defensins, had a highly conserved 12-residue extension to its C-terminal compared to defensins from other insects. Monoisotopic mass analysis of the C-terminal of B. pascuorum defensin confirmed that this molecule was C-terminally amidated. This defensin showed strong anti-Gram-positive activity and some anti-fungal activity; also, in contrast to other insect defensins, it showed anti-Gram-negative activity. A 17-residue apidaecin was characterized, showing anti-Gram-negative activity, and differing by a single amino acid substitution from the A. mellifera apidaecin. A 39-residue abaecin was isolated, the largest proline-rich antimicrobial peptide characterized to date, which showed activity against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Finally, we isolated an N-terminally blocked molecule, with a molecular mass of 10,122 Da, which showed activity against Gram-negative bacteria only. These characteristics are reminiscent of hymenoptaecin from the honeybee A. mellifera, but a definitive characterization of this molecule awaits further work. No evidence of lysozyme activity was found in the haemolymph of challenged or naive B. pascuorum.
TI  - Susceptibility of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to a photodynamic effect of the arginine hematoporphyrin derivative.
AB  - The photodynamic effect of the arginine hematoporphyrin derivative (HpD-Arg(2)) on the growth of selected Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolates is described as compared to the effect of hematoporphyrin derivative (HpD). Growth inhibition of HpD-Arg(2) of three Gram-positive strains (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis and Micrococcus luteus) and five laboratory strains of Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, P. aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae) was observed as well. Serratia marcescens strain was resistant to light-activated HpD-Arg(2) or HpD. The antimicrobial activity of light-activated HpD-Arg(2) against P. aeruginosa may offer an additional option in the anti-pseudomonal therapy of wounds.
TI  - Function of the novel subdomain in the RNA binding domain of transcription termination factor Rho from Micrococcus luteus.
AB  - Transcription termination factor Rho from Micrococcus luteus, a high G + C Gram-positive bacterium, contains an unusual extra sequence within its RNA binding domain that is rich in Arg, Glu, and Asp residues and deficient in hydrophobic residues. To determine the role of this extra sequence, we compared the biochemical properties of a variant lacking nearly all the extra sequence, des(60-300) Rho, to that of wild-type M. luteus Rho. The two forms had very similar properties except that the des(60-300) Rho was unable to terminate transcription with Escherichia coli RNA polymerase at the promoter proximal sites used by the wild-type Rho on a lambda cro DNA template but could cause termination at more distal sites and did cause termination at proximal sites when ITP replaced GTP in the reaction mixture. The RNA binding properties of the two forms of this Rho with normal and inosine-substituted RNAs were found to correlate fully with their termination properties. These results indicate that the arginine-rich extra sequence is directly involved in the selection of the termination site and support the hypothesis that the sequence is present in M. luteus Rho to facilitate its binding to M. luteus transcripts, which are likely to have a high degree of base-paired secondary structure because of their high proportion of G residues.
TI  - UV endonuclease of Micrococcus luteus, a cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer-DNA glycosylase/abasic lyase: cloning and characterization of the gene.
AB  - The gene of Micrococcus luteus UV endonuclease (cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer-DNA  glycosylase/ abasic lyase) was cloned and characterized. The cloned gene, whose product had a predicted molecular mass of 17,120 Da, was found to be capable of complementing the Escherichia coli uvrA6 mutation in vivo with respect to resistance to acetonemediated molecular photosensitization, a treatment producing exclusively cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers in DNA. It also generated a nicking activity specific for photosensitization-treated DNA by in vitro transcription/translation. When expressed in E. coli cells, the gene produced a protein structurally identical with UV endonuclease and possessing an activity consistent with cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer-DNA glycosylase/abasic lyase with respect to the effect of inhibitors and the site of the DNA backbone scission. Furthermore, the UV endonuclease-deficient mutant DB7 was shown to regain the enzyme through transformation with the cloned gene. The deduced amino acid sequence of the gene product was at best 27% identical with that of endonuclease V of phage T4, an enzyme strikingly similar to UV endonuclease in molecular and catalytic properties. Despite this marginal overall similarity in amino acid sequence, four of the seven amino acid residues reported to be functionally important in the T4 enzyme were found to be conserved in the M. luteus enzyme. We propose that the gene be called uveA.
TI  - Protein purification and nucleotide sequence of a lysozyme from the bacteria-induced larvae of the fall webworm, Hyphantria cunea.
AB  - A protein with lytic activity against Micrococcus luteus was purified from the hemolymph of the fall webworm, Hyphantria cunea, larvae challenged with live E. coli. A bacteriolytic protein of about 14,000 daltons in mass was purified by cation exchange chromatography and reverse-phased HPLC. The optimum pH and optimum temperature range for activity were around pH 6.2 and 50 degrees C, respectively, in a 100 mM phosphate buffer. The amino-terminal amino acid sequence of this protein was determined and the corresponding cDNA was isolated and analyzed. The deduced protein of 142 amino acid residues was composed of a putative leader sequence of 20 residues and the mature enzyme of 122 residues. The cloned lysozyme gene was strongly induced in response to bacterial injection, implying that the enzyme is a part of the immune response of H. cunea. Comparison with other known lysozyme sequences shows that our lysozyme belongs to the chicken lysozyme.
TI  - The topodynamics of incision of UV-irradiated covalently closed DNA by the Escherichia coli Uvr(A)BC endonuclease.
AB  - The Escherichia coli Uvr(A)BC endonuclease (Uvr(A)BC) initiates nucleotide excision repair of a large variety of DNA damages. The damage recognition and incision steps by the Uvr(A)BC is a complex process utilizing an ATP-dependent DNA helix-tracking activity associated with the UvrA2B1 complex. The latter activity leads to the generation of highly positively supercoiled DNA in the presence of E. coli topoisomerase I in vitro. Such highly positively supercoiled DNA, containing ultraviolet irradiation-induced photoproducts (uvDNA), is resistant to the incision by Uvr(A)BC, whereas the negatively supercoiled and relaxed forms of the uvDNA are effectively incised. The E. coli gyrase can contribute to the above reaction by abolishing the accumulation of highly positively supercoiled uvDNA thereby restoring Uvr(A)BC-catalyzed incision. Eukaryotic (calf thymus) topoisomerase I is able to substitute for gyrase in restoring this Uvr(A)BC-mediated incision reaction. The inability of Uvr(A)BC to incise highly positively supercoiled uvDNA results from the failure of the formation of UvrAB-dependent obligatory intermediates associated with the DNA conformational change. In contrast to Uvr(A)BC, the Micrococcus luteus UV endonuclease efficiently incises uvDNA regardless of its topological state. The in vitro topodynamic system proposed in this study may provide a simple model for studying a topological aspect of nucleotide excision repair and its interaction with other DNA topology-related processes in E. coli.
TI  - Dielectrophoretic separation of bacteria using a conductivity gradient.
AB  - Dielectrophoresis, the lateral motion induced on particles by non-uniform electric fields, is a sensitive function of the electrical conductivity of the particle suspending medium. This dependence is exploited in a new technique for separating bioparticles from suspended mixtures. The bioparticles are first immobilised by positive dielectrophoresis at electrodes in a separation chamber, and the conductivity of the liquid flowing through the chamber is then gradually and continuously increased so as to produce a conductivity gradient with time. The bioparticles are released from the electrodes according to their own dielectric properties and as a function of flow rate and medium conductivity. This is demonstrated for pure suspensions and mixtures of the bacteria Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli and Micrococcus luteus.
TI  - Phenotypic segregation of Aedes aegypti for immune antibacterial activity and resistance to filariae.
AB  - We report the phenotypic selection of two lines of Aedes aegypti, from a filariae susceptible parental stock (Refm). This selection was based upon the level of inducible anti-gram negative Escherichia coli activity within the haemolymph following E. coli infection. These lines, denoted 'high' and 'low', demonstrated significant differences in anti-E. coli responses throughout. However no difference was observed in the anti-gram positive Micrococcus luteus response following E. coli challenge. F4, F6 and F9 mosquitoes were experimentally infected with Brugia pahangi microfilariae. Reductions of between 53 and 82% in the mean number of larvae completing development in the 'high' compared with the 'low' responding line were observed. Corresponding reductions of between 30 and 50% in the mosquito infection rates also occurred between these lines. These reductions were significant for trials on the F6 and F9 generations. We have therefore selected for Ae. aegypti possessing significant refractoriness to filaria infection. Importantly, this 'high' line has not been exposed to selection pressure using filariae development as a phenotypic selective marker.
TI  - Isolation and sequencing of the rho gene from Streptomyces lividans ZX7 and characterization of the RNA-dependent NTPase activity of the overexpressed protein.
AB  - The gene for transcription termination factor Rho was isolated from Streptomyces  lividans ZX7. It encoded a 77-kDa polypeptide (Rho 77) with considerable homology to known Rho factors. An atypical hydrophilic region of 228 residues was found within the N-terminal RNA-binding domain. Only Rho from Micrococcus luteus and Mycobacterium leprae (closely related GC-rich Gram-positive bacteria) had an analogous sequence. Rho 77 was overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified using an N-terminal hexahistidine-tag. Rho 77 displayed a broad RNA-dependent ATPase activity, with poly(C) RNA being no more than 4-fold more effective than poly(A). This contrasts with the ATPase activity of Rho from E. coli which is stimulated primarily by poly(C) RNA. Rho 77 was a general RNA-dependent NTPase, apparent Km values for NTPs were: GTP 0.13 mM, ATP 0.17 mM, UTP 1.1 mM, and CTP >2 mM. Rho 77 poly(C)-dependent ATPase activity was inhibited by heparin, unlike the E. coli Rho. The antibiotic bicyclomycin inhibited the in vitro RNA-dependent ATPase activity of Rho 77, did not inhibit growth of streptomycetes but delayed the development of aerial mycelia. N-terminal deletion analysis to express a truncated form of Rho (Rho 72, 72 kDa) indicated that the first 42 residues of Rho 77 were not essential for RNA-dependent NTPase activity and were not the targets of inhibition by heparin or bicyclomycin.
TI  - Inactivation of bacteria and yeasts on agar surfaces with high power Nd:YAG laser light.
AB  - Near infrared light from a high-powered, 1064 nm, Neodymium:Yttrium Aluminium Garnet (Nd:YAG) laser killed a variety of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and two yeasts, lawned on nutrient agar plates. A beam (cross-sectional area, 1.65 cm2) of laser light was delivered in 10 J, 8 ms pulses at 10 Hz, in a series of exposure times. For each microbial species, a dose/response curve was obtained of area of inactivation vs energy density (J cm-2). The energy density that gave an inactivation area (IA) equal to 50% of the beam area was designated the IA50-value and was plotted together with its 95% confidence limits. Average IA50-values were all within a threefold range and varied from 1768 J cm-2 for Serratia marcescens to 4489 J cm-2 for vegetative cells of Bacillus stearothermophilus. There were no systematic differences in sensitivity attributable to cell shape, size, pigmentation or Gram reaction. At the lowest energy densities where inactivation was achieved for the majority of organisms (around 2000 J cm-2), no effect was observed on the nutrient agar surface, but as the energy density was increased, a depression in the agar surface was formed, followed by localized melting of the agar.
TI  - Inducible immune factors of the vector mosquito Anopheles gambiae: biochemical purification of a defensin antibacterial peptide and molecular cloning of preprodefensin cDNA.
AB  - Larvae of the mosquito vector of human malaria, Anopheles gambiae, were inoculated with bacteria and extracts were biochemically fractionated by reverse-phase HPLC. Multiple induced polypeptides and antibacterial activities were observed following bacterial infection, including a member of the insect defensin family of antibacterial proteins. A cDNA encoding An. gambiae preprodefensin was isolated using PCR primers based on phylogenetically conserved sequences. The mature peptide is highly conserved, but the signal and propeptide segments are not, relative to corresponding defensin sequences of other insects. Defensin expression is induced in response to bacterial infection, in both adult and larval stages. In contrast, pupae express defensin mRNA constitutively. Defensin expression may prove a valuable molecular marker to monitor the An. gambiae host response to infection by parasitic protozoa of medical importance.
TI  - Nucleotide level detection of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers using oligonucleotides and magnetic beads to facilitate labelling of DNA fragments incised at the dimers and chemical sequencing reference ladders.
AB  - We present a method for detecting cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) at the nucleotide level and an adaptation of Maxam-Gilbert sequencing for generating sequence reference ladders. UV irradiated genomic DNA from Escherichia coli was digested with restriction enzyme(s) and incised at the CPDs with Micrococcus luteus UV endonuclease. The subsequent specific fragments were separated using a biotin labelled oligonucleotide containing a sequence complementary to the fragments of interest and streptavidin magnetic beads. These fragments were then radiolabelled on the beads just prior to the running of the sequencing gel. For generating sequence reference ladders, the unlabelled DNA fragments of interest were base-specifically modified and subsequently cleaved at the A+G or C+T sites using the rapid Maxam-Gilbert sequencing treatments. These chemically cleaved fragments can be stored almost indefinitely. Whenever the sequence reference ladders are required, the chemically cleaved fragments can be labelled alongside the CPD-specifically incised DNA fragments using the same procedure. The adaptation of the method to detect other types of DNA damage is also discussed.
TI  - Aedes aegypti: induced antibacterial proteins reduce the establishment and development of Brugia malayi.
AB  - The effect of host immune activation on the development of Brugia malayi in one susceptible and four refractory strains of Aedes aegypti and in Armigeres subalbatus was assessed. A. aegypti that were immune activated by the injection of saline or bacteria 24 hr before feeding on a B. malayi-infected gerbil had significantly reduced prevalences and mean intensities of infection from those of naive controls when exposed to bloodmeals with low (105 mf/20 microliters) and medium (160 mf/20 microliters) microfilaremias. At a higher microfilaremia (237 mf/20 microliters) there were no significant differences in mean intensities, suggesting that the number of parasites ingested may affect the host's ability to mount an effective defense response. Because the major immune proteins in A. aegypti are defensins, we did Northern analyses of fat body RNA 8 hr after immune activation or bloodfeeding. All mosquitoes demonstrated rapid transcriptional activity for defensins following immune activation by intrathoracic inoculation with either saline or bacteria. However, no strain of A. aegypti, susceptible or refractory to B. malayi, nor Ar. subalbatus produced defensin transcripts after bloodfeeding on an uninfected or a B. malayi-infected gerbil. These data suggest that inducible immune proteins of mosquitoes can reduce the prevalence and mean intensity of infections with ingested parasites, but these proteins are not expressed routinely after parasite ingestion and midgut penetration and probably do not contribute to existing refractory mechanisms. Immune proteins such as defensins, however, represent potential candidates to genetically engineer mosquitoes for resistance to filarial worms.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Paliurus spina-christi Mill. (Christ's thorn).
AB  
TI  - The Streptomyces peucetius drrC gene encodes a UvrA-like protein involved in daunorubicin resistance and production.
AB  - The drrC gene, cloned from the daunorubicin (DNR)- and doxorubicin-producing strain of Streptomyces peucetius ATCC 29050, encodes a 764-amino-acid protein with a strong sequence similarity to the Escherichia coli and Micrococcus luteus UvrA proteins involved in excision repair of DNA. Expression of drrC was correlated with the timing of DNR production in the growth medium tested and was not dependent on the presence of DNR. Since introduction of drrC into Streptomyces lividans imparted a DNR resistance phenotype, this gene is believed to be a DNR resistance gene. The drrC gene could be disrupted in the non-DNR-producing S. peucetius dnrJ mutant but not in the wild-type strain, and the resulting dnrJ drrC double mutant was significantly more sensitive to DNR in efficiency-of-plating experiments. Expression of drrC in an E. coli uvrA strain conferred significant DNR resistance to this highly DNR-sensitive mutant. However, the DrrC protein did not complement the uvrA mutation to protect the mutant from the lethal effects of UV or mitomycin even though it enhanced the UV resistance of a uvrA+ strain. We speculate that the DrrC protein mediates a novel type of DNR resistance, possibly different from the mechanism of DNR resistance governed by the S. peucetius drrAB genes, which are believed to encode a DNR antiporter.
TI  - Highly selective acridine and ethidium staining of bacterial DNA and RNA.
AB  - The acridine dyes acridine orange (AO) and coriphosphine O (CPO) and ethidium bromide (EtBr) were used to stain bacterial digests after electrophoresis in native and denaturing (SDS) polyacrylamide gels and were shown to stain DNA and RNA preferentially over other subcellular components in the gels. Vegetative cell digests of Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, and Staphylococcus aureus showed intense staining of DNA with AO and CPO near the top of the gel, but little or no staining of other cellular constituents. EtBr stained both DNA and RNA in the gels. Protein standards and non-nucleic acid cellular constituents stained faintly with high concentrations (> or = 100 microM) of AO, lower concentrations (13.9 microM) of CPO, and did not stain with 0.5 microgram/ml EtBr in denaturing gels. The complete set of cellular biochemicals was visualized by silver staining, while the protein subset was detected by Coomassie blue staining. The highest concentrations of AO (120 microM) and CPO (13.9 microM) were shown to detect purified DNA in gels with a sensitivity in the range of 25-50 ng per band. This work demonstrates the specificity of acridine and ethidium dyes for nucleic acids, while illustrating the level of non-nucleic acid-specific interactions with other cellular components by staining of electrophoretically separated cellular components in a gel matrix.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence of 5'-upstream region and expression of a silkworm gene encoding a new member of the attacin family.
AB  - A genomic clone encoding a new member of attacin, an insect antibacterial protein, was isolated from a genomic library of the silkworm, Bombyx mori, and the nucleotide sequence of the 5'-upstream region was determined. The region contained Bm 1, a highly repetitive element of B. mori and a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) response element (RE)(NF-kappaB binding site), CAAT box and TATA box. Northern blot analysis showed that the attacin gene expression was rapidly induced by bacterial cell wall components such as LPS from Escherichia coli and peptidoglycan (PG) from Micrococcus luteus, suggesting that attacin plays an important role in an early phase of the self-defense system upon bacterial infection.
TI  - Antibacterial hydroperoxysterols from Xanthosoma robustum.
AB  - Three new hydroperoxysterols, 24-hydroperoxy-4 alpha, 14 alpha- dimethylcholesta-8,25-dien-3 beta-ol, 25-hydroperoxy-4 alpha, 14 alpha-dimethylcholesta-8,23-dien-3 beta-ol and 25-hydroperoxycycloart-23-en- 3 beta-ol, have been isolated from the aerial parts of Xanthosoma robustum, besides 24-hydroperoxycycloart-25-en-3 beta-ol, 4 alpha, 14 alpha-dimethylcholesta-8,24-dien-3 beta-ol and cycloartenol. Additionally, the two new diols, 4 alpha, 14 alpha-dimethylcholesta-8,25-dien-3 beta, 24-diol and 4 alpha, 14 alpha-dimethylcholesta-8,23-dien-3 beta, 25-diol were obtained from the first two hydroperoxysterols, respectively, by reduction with triphenylphosphine. The structures have been defined by chemical and spectroscopic studies. The four hydroperoxysterols exhibited antibacterial activities against Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis and Micrococcus luteus.
TI  - Synergistic contributions of asparagine 46 and aspartate 52 to the catalytic mechanism of chicken egg white lysozyme.
AB  - The X-ray structure of a chicken egg white lysozyme (ChEWL) complex with a peptidoglycan-derived inhibitor suggests that interactions of Asn46 and Asp52 with the D-subsite N-acetylmuramic acid residue help to distort that pyranose ring into the reactive half-chair conformation and that a hydrogen bond is formed between Asn46 and Asp52 [Strynadka, N. C. J., & James, M. N. G. (1991) J. Mol. Biol. 220, 401-424]. These hypotheses were investigated through the D52A, N46A, and D52A/N46A mutants of ChEWL. The Michaelis constants of the D52A and D52A/N46A ChEWL complexes with Micrococcus luteus cells are 3- and 4-fold higher, respectively, than the wild-type KM; the corresponding kcat values are 25- and 50-fold lower, respectively, than the wild-type kcat. These results support the proposal of Strynadka and James. The velocities of reactions catalyzed by the N46A and D52A mutants are approximately equal to each other for all classes of substrate, suggesting that the respective roles of Asn46 and Asp52 in transition state stabilization do not vary. The mutation of either Asn46 or Asp52 to Ala apparently disrupts the interactions of the other (nonmutated) residue with the substrate, supporting the crystallographic evidence of a hydrogen-bond interaction between the two residues. The mutations do not change the values of the dissociation constants of complexes with (carboxymethyl)chitin complexes, suggesting that ground state complexes of ChEWL with chitin-derived substrates differ in conformation from complexes with bacterial peptidoglycans.
TI  - Is aspartate 52 essential for catalysis by chicken egg white lysozyme? The role of natural substrate-assisted hydrolysis.
AB  - The chicken and goose egg white lysozymes (ChEWL and GoEWL) are homologues, but differ in substrate specificity. ChEWL catalyzes the hydrolysis of the glycosidic bonds of bacterial peptidoglycans and chitin-derived substrates, while GoEWL is specific for bacterial peptidoglycans. The active-site aspartate 52 residue of ChEWL, which is postulated to stabilize the oxocarbenium ion intermediate, has no counterpart in GoEWL. The substrate specificity of the D52A ChEWL mutant was compared with those of wild-type ChEWL and GoEWL. D52A ChEWL retains approximately 4% of the wild-type catalytic activity in reactions with three different bacterial cell suspensions. Asp52 therefore is not essential to the catalytic mechanism, accounting for only a 2 kcal/mol decrease in delta G++. The function of Asp52 in D52A ChEWL- and GoEWL-catalyzed cleavage of (carboxymethyl)chitin may be partially fulfilled by an appropriately positioned carboxyl group on the substrate (substrate-assisted catalysis). D52A ChEWL and GoEWL, unlike wild-type ChEWL, exhibit biphasic kinetics in the clearing of Micrococcus luteus cell suspensions, suggesting preferences for subsets of the linkages in the M. luteus peptidoglycan. These subsets do not exist in the peptidoglycans of Escherichia coli or Sarcina lutea, since neither D52A ChEWL nor GoEWL exhibits initial bursts in reactions with suspensions of these bacteria. We propose that substrate-assisted catalysis occurs in reactions of D52A ChEWL and GoEWL with M. luteus peptidoglycans, with the glycine carboxyl group of un-cross-linked peptides attached to N-acetylmuramic acid partially substituting the function of the missing Asp52.
TI  - Ecdysone and insect immunity: the maturation of the inducibility of the diptericin gene in Drosophila larvae.
AB  - The developmental analysis of the inducibility of the Drosophila diptericin gene  promoter as a response to septic injury shows an important increase in the response during the third larval instar leading to a maximum in late larvae and early prepupae. This increase, or maturation, is temporally correlated with known ecdysone induced events of the salivary gland and we now present evidence, using wild type and mutant larvae, that it does indeed depend upon ecdysone. The response remains minimal in larvae carrying either the temperature sensitive ecdysone deficient late larval lethal allele ecd1, or l(1)t187, a deep orange allele known to be deficient in the ecdysone response. However, experiments with the late larval lethal Broad-Complex mutant l(1)t435 show that the regulation of this response is distinct from the developmental ecdysone regulated hierarchies.
TI  - The C-terminal bisphosphorylated proenkephalin-A-(209-237)-peptide from adrenal medullary chromaffin granules possesses antibacterial activity.
AB  - The chromaffin granules have been shown to be an excellent model to study the processing of proenkephalin-A and chromogranins. Recently, we reported a study dealing with the processing of chromogranin B/secretogranin I and the occurrence of the C-terminal chromogranin B-derived peptide 614-626 which was shown to have antibacterial activity [Strub, J.M., Garcia-Sablone, P., Looning, K., Taupenot, L., Hubert, P., Van Dorsselaer, A., Aunis, D. & Metz-Boutigue, M.H. (1995) Eur. J. Biochem. 229, 356-368]. We also observed that this new antibacterial activity present in chromaffin granules was associated with other endogenous protein-derived fragments yet to be characterized. The present study reports the isolation and characterization of a peptide which possesses antibacterial activity and which corresponds to the C-terminal 209-237 sequence of proenkephalin-A. A detailed study using microsequencing and matrix-assisted-laser-desorption time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALD-TOF MS) allowed us to correlate the antibacterial activity of this peptide named enkelytin (FAEPLPSEEEGESYSKEVPEMEKRYGGFM) with post-translational modifications. Endogenous bisphosphorylated proenkephalin-A-(209-237) was active on Micrococcus luteus and Bacillus megaterium killing bacteria in the 0.2 - 0.4 microM range but was inactive in similar conditions towards Escherichia coli. Enkelytin shares sequence and structural similarities with the antibacterial C-terminal domain of diazepam-binding inhibitor. According to this similarity, a prediction of secondary structure is proposed for enkelytin and discussed in relationship to its biological activity.
TI  - Characterization of an unusual Rho factor from the high G + C gram-positive bacterium Micrococcus luteus.
AB  - A transcription termination factor (Rho) was purified from the Gram-positive bacterium Micrococcus luteus, and the complete gene sequence was determined. The M. luteus Rho polypeptide has 690 residues, which is 271 residues more than its homolog from Escherichia coli. Most of the additional residues compose a highly charged, hydrophilic segment that is inserted in a non-conserved region between two conserved regions of the RNA-binding domain of the known Rho homolog proteins. This segment extends from residues 49 to 311 and includes a stretch of 238 residues that contain no hydrophobic side chains. Biochemical studies indicate that the M. luteus protein is very similar to E. coli Rho in terms of its RNA-dependent NTPase activity and its sensitivity to the Rho-specific inhibitor bicyclomycin. However, the M. luteus protein has a less stringent RNA cofactor specificity. It also acts to terminate RNA transcription with E. coli RNA polymerase on the lambda cro DNA template, but at much earlier termination stop points than those recognized by E. coli Rho. Thus, the M. luteus protein functions as a true Rho factor, but with a different specificity than that of E. coli Rho. We propose that this altered specificity is consistent with its need to function on transcripts that have a high content of G + C residues.

TI  - Synthesis and in vitro antibacterial activity of spermidine-based mixed catechol- and hydroxamate-containing siderophore--vancomycin conjugates.
AB  - The first antibiotic conjugates of vancomycin (1) and siderophore analogues containing spermidine-based catechol ligands (conjugate 11) as well as mixed catechol and hydroxamate ligands (conjugate 13) are described. The design of the conjugates was based on the earlier observation that conjugation of siderophore components to beta-lactam antibiotics induced active iron transport-mediated drug delivery. The novel conjugates (11 and 13) were synthesized by selective acylation of the primary amino group of 1. Preliminary biological studies indicated that siderophore modified vancomycins lost some activity (4- to 16-fold) against Gram-positive bacteria relative to vancomycin itself, and were generally similar to vancomycin in activity against Gram-negative bacteria under iron-sufficient conditions. However, under iron-depleted conditions which mimic human serum, conjugate 11 displayed enhanced antibacterial activity against an antibiotic hypersensitive strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Biological screening of traditional medicinal plants from Papua New Guinea.
AB  - Based on ethnopharmacological literature, 17 species of medicinal plants used in  the traditional medicine in Papua New Guinea were collected. Extracts of different polarities were tested in a preliminary biological screening for their antimicrobial (Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus and Penicillium oxalicum) and molluscicidal activity against Biomphalaria glabrata as well as for their toxicity to brine shrimp. The pretreated plant extracts were also investigated for their ability to inhibit protein kinase C and tyrosine-specific protein kinase of epidermal growth factor receptor. Furthermore, all plants were screened for the presence of alkaloids.
TI  - Antibacterial triterpenoids from Dillenia papuana and their structure-activity relationships.
AB  - Two new oleanene-type triterpenoids, dillenic acids D and E, have been isolated from the leaves and stems of Dillenia papuana together with the new natural product 3-oxoolean-12-en-30-oic acid. Together with these compounds, the known compound, betulinic acid (3 beta-hydroxy-20(29)-lupen-28-oic acid) was isolated as the major component of the fractions studied. Dillenic acids D and E were characterized as 2,3-seco-2-oxoolean-12-en-3-methylester-30-oic acid and 1 alpha,3 beta-dihydroxyolean-12-en-30-oic acid and their nuclear magnetic resonance data were unambiguously assigned using two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance techniques. A comparison of antibacterial activities of these compounds with the earlier reported dillenic acids A-C indicated that, aside from a double bond in gamma- or delta-position to a carboxylic group, a ketone function in ring A of an oleanene-skeleton may be required for the observed activity.
TI  - Purification and cloning of Micrococcus luteus ultraviolet endonuclease, an N-glycosylase/abasic lyase that proceeds via an imino enzyme-DNA intermediate.
AB  - Although Micrococcus luteus UV endonuclease has been reported to be an 18-kDa enzyme with possible homology to the 16-kDa endonuclease V from bacteriophage T4 (Gordon, L. K., and Haseltine, W. A. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 12047-12050; Grafstrom, R. H., Park, L., and Grossman, L. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 13465-13474), this study describes three independent purification schemes in which M. luteus UV damage-specific or pyrimidine dimer-specific nicking activity was associated with two proteins of apparent molecular masses of 31 and 32 kDa. An 18-kDa contaminant copurified with the doublet through many of the chromatographic steps, but it was determined to be a homolog of Escherichia coli ribosomal protein L6. Edman degradation analyses of the active proteins yielded identical NH2-terminal amino acid sequences. The corresponding gene (pdg, pyrimidine dimer glycosylase) was cloned. The protein bears strong sequence similarities to the E. coli repair proteins endonuclease III and MutY. Nonetheless, traditionally purified M. luteus protein acted exclusively on cis-syn thymine dimers; it was unable to cleave site-specific oligonucleotide substrates containing a trans-syn -I, (6-4), or Dewar thymine dimer, a 5,6-dihydrouracil lesion, or an A:G or A:C mismatch. The UV endonuclease incised cis-syn dimer-containing DNA in a dose-dependent manner and exhibited linear kinetics within that dose range. Enzyme activity was inhibited by the presence of NaCN or NaBH4 with NaBH4 additionally being able to trap a covalent enzyme-substrate product. These last findings confirm that the catalytic mechanism of M. luteus UV endonuclease, like those of other glycosylase/AP lyases, involves an imino intermediate.
TI  - Cloning and sequencing of a secY homolog from Streptomyces scabies.
AB  - The complete DNA sequence of the Streptomyces scabies (Ss) secY homolog and partial sequences of adjacent upstream and downstream open reading frames (ORFs) have been determined. The nucleotide sequence of a 2-kb region predicts a polypeptide of 437 amino acids in length with homology to the SecY protein family. The Ss secY homolog lies upstream from a sequence that has homology to the adenylate kinase gene (adk) family. The translational stop codon of the putative SecY ORF overlaps the predicted start codon for the Adk ORF. Another ORF that lies upstream from the secY homolog has sequence similarity to the genes that code for the L15 r-protein. Within the 243-bp intergenic region between the L15 and SecY coding sequences, the presence of a streptomycete-like promoter sequence and an 18-bp inverted repeat suggests that the secY homolog and the adjacent downstream sequences may be transcribed independently of the L15 coding sequence. Transcript analysis indicates that the secY homolog is expressed in both Ss and Streptomyces lividans. The proposed gene and transcript organization of the L15-SecY-Adk coding regions in the Ss clone resembles that of Micrococcus luteus which, like the streptomycetes, has a G+C-rich genome.
TI  - Insect immunity: isolation of three novel inducible antibacterial defensins from  the vector mosquito, Aedes aegypti.
AB  - The injection of Escherichia coli and Micrococcus luteus into the hemocoel of Aedes aegypti induces a potent antibacterial activity in the hemolymph. We have purified and fully characterized three 40-residue antibacterial peptides from the hemolymph of bacteria-challenged mosquitoes that are absent in naive mosquitoes. The peptides are potently active against Gram-positive bacteria and against one of the Gram-negative bacteria that were tested. The amino acid sequences clearly show that the three peptides are novel isoforms of the insect defensin family of antibacterial peptides. They differ from each other by one or two amino acid residues. We present here the complete amino acid sequences of the three isoforms and the activity spectrum of the predominant Aedes defensin.
TI  - Processing of chromogranin B in bovine adrenal medulla. Identification of secretolytin, the endogenous C-terminal fragment of residues 614-626 with antibacterial activity.
AB  - Chromogranins constitute a family of acidic soluble proteins widely distributed in endocrine cells and neurons. Chromogranin A, the major soluble component in bovine adrenal medullary secretory granules in chromaffin cells, has been shown to be actively processed to peptide fragments [Metz-Boutigue, M. H., Garcia-Sablone, P., Hogue-Angeletti, R. & Aunis, D. (1993) Eur. J. Biochem. 217, 247-257]. In the present paper, the structural features of the proteolytic degradation mechanism of chromogranin B/secretogranin I have been characterized with regard to the possible function of this protein as a precursor of biologically active peptides. Chromogranin-B-derived fragments present in bovine chromaffin granules were identified by microsequencing after separation by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis or high-performance liquid chromatography. A similar approach was performed to characterize chromogranin-B-derived fragments released into the extracellular space from depolarized bovine cultured chromaffin cells. In chromogranin B, 18 cleavage sites were identified along the protein chain and chromogranin B/secretogranin I fragments were generated by proteolytic attack at both the N-terminus and C-terminus. A major fragment corresponding to residues 614-626 of the C-terminal sequence, was identified in the extracellular space; this peptide was found to share sequence and structural similarities with the lytic domain of cecropins and, as expected from this similarity, to display potent antibacterial properties. Endogenous and synthetic peptides were active on Micrococus luteus, killing bacteria in the micromolar concentration range. The synthetic peptide slows the growth of Bacillus megaterium and was inactive towards Escherichia coli. In addition, the synthetic peptide was unable to induce hemolytic activity. This antibacterial function might be of biological significance in the neuroendocrine system of living organisms. We propose to name this peptide secretolytin.
TI  - A promoter associated with the neisserial repeat can be used to transcribe the uvrB gene from Neisseria gonorrhoeae.
AB  - A recombinant plasmid capable of restoring UV resistance to an Escherichia coli uvrB mutant was isolated from a genomic library of Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Sequence analysis revealed an open reading frame whose deduced amino acid sequence displayed significant similarity to those of the UvrB proteins of E. coli, Micrococcus luteus, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. A gonococcal uvrB mutant was constructed and found to be extremely sensitive to UV radiation. Transcriptional fusions between portions of the gonococcal uvrB upstream region and a reporter gene were used to localize promoter activity, and the transcriptional start point of the gonococcal uvrB gene was mapped in E. coli by primer extension. A corresponding sigma 70 promoter was identified within a copy of the 26-bp neisserial repeat, and this identification provided the first evidence of a promoter associated with this repetitive element in N. gonorrhoeae.
TI  - Humoral defense of the nematode Ascaris suum: antibacterial, bacteriolytic and agglutinating activities in the body fluid.
AB  - Three humoral defense activities (antibacterial, bacteriolytic and agglutinating) were detected in the body fluid of the nematode Ascaris suum. Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis) were more sensitive to the antibacterial activity than the Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli). The antibacterial activity was heat stable and was lost by trypsin digestion. The molecular mass of the factor responsible for antibacterial activity was estimated as 6 kDa. The bacteriolytic activity against dried Micrococcus luteus was also detected. The bacteriolytic factor was 6-9 kDa in molecular mass, heat sensitive and trypsin sensitive. Both E. coli and glutaraldehyde-fixed trypsin-treated human A-type red blood cells were agglutinated in the body fluid. An analytical gel permeation HPLC revealed the agglutinating activity consists of at least two factors. Activities of both agglutinating factors were lost by heat treatment or trypsin digestion. The molecular masses estimated for the two agglutinating factors were 500 kDa and 25 kDa. Under experimental conditions, microbe-injection was not a prerequisite for the appearance of these defense activities.
TI  - Mode of action of the lantibiotic mersacidin: inhibition of peptidoglycan biosynthesis via a novel mechanism?
AB  - Mersacidin is an antibiotic peptide produced by Bacillus sp. strain HIL Y-85,54728 that belongs to the group of lantibiotics. Its activity in vivo against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains compares with that of the glycopeptide antibiotic vancomycin (S. Chatterjee, D. K. Chatterjee, R. H. Jani, J. Blumbach, B. N. Ganguli, N. Klesel, M. Limbert, and G. Seibert, J. Antibiot. 45:839-845, 1992). Incubation of Staphylococcus simulans 22 with mersacidin resulted in the cessation of growth and slow lysis. Biosyntheses of DNA, RNA, and protein were not affected, whereas incorporation of glucose and D-alanine was inhibited and a regular reduction in the level of cell wall thickness was observed. Thus, unlike type A lantibiotics, mersacidin does not form pores in the cytoplasmic membrane but rather inhibits cell wall biosynthesis. Comparison with tunicamycin-treated cells indicated that peptidoglycan rather than teichoic acid metabolism is primarily affected. Mersacidin caused the excretion of a putative cell wall precursor into the culture supernatant. The formation of polymeric peptidoglycan was effectively inhibited in an in vitro assay, probably on the level of transglycosylation. In contrast to vancomycin, the activity of mersacidin was not antagonized by the tripeptide diacetyl-L-Lys-D-Ala-D-Ala, indicating that on the molecular level its mode of action differs from those of glycopeptide antibiotics. These data together with electron microscopy suggest that mersacidin acts on a novel target, which opens new perspectives for the treatment of methicillin-resistant S. aureus.
TI  - Small clusters of divergent amino acids surrounding the effector domain mediate the varied phenotypes of EF-G and LepA expression.
AB  - Elongation factors G, Tu, and related proteins (including LepA) form a distinct subgroup within the GTPase superfamily. This observation is based primarily upon amino acid comparisons of the effector region (G2) of the GTP-binding domain. To examine the functional importance of the highly conserved elongation factor G2 domain a series of chimeric proteins were constructed between Escherichia coli EF-G and Micrococcus luteus EF-G, and between E. coli EF-G and LepA (a protein of unknown function). The M. luteus EF-G/E. coli EF-G hybrid, M. luteus EF-G, and E. coli EF-G efficiently complemented EF-G function in an E. coli strain (PEM101) harbouring a temperature-sensitive mutation in fusA (the gene encoding EF-G). A comparison of the amino acid sequences of the M. luteus EF-G and E. coli EF-G indicated that groups of divergent amino acid residues (amino acids 1-9 and 72-80) were not important for function. LepA and LepA/EF-G chimeric proteins were tested for the ability to complement EF-G function in vivo, for cross-linking to 8-azido-[gamma-32P]-GTP in vitro and for fusidic acid-dependent co-sedimentation with 70S ribosomes. With one exception, all chimeras could be readily cross-linked to azido-GTP in an EF-G-like manner, indicating that hybrid protein construction did not generally result in improperly folded GTP-binding domains. However, the inability of such chimeras to complement EF-G function in vivo indicates that the effector domains are not functionally interchangeable. All LepA/EF-G chimeric proteins were severely defective in fusidic acid-dependent complex formation with 70S ribosomes. A comparison of the amino acid sequences of all three proteins suggests that residues 30-33, 43-48, and 63-66 of E. coli EF-G are important for EF-G specific ribosome-associated function.
TI  - Transformation of microorganisms with the plasmid vector with the replicon from pAC1 from Acetobacter pasteurianus.
AB  - A number of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria species was screened for the expression of the gram-negative plasmid pACK5 and pACT72 with replicon of pAC1 plasmid from Acetobacter pasteurianus. As was described previously, both plasmids were expressed in Escherichia coli, Acetobacter pasteurianus, Acetobacter aceti, Shigella spp. and Citrobacter spp. Expressions of plasmids were successful in twelve species tested, Comamonas terrigena, Salmonella typhimurium, Serratia marcescens, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus megatericum, Bacillus subtilis, Lactobacillus helveticus, Micrococcus luteus, Sarcina lutea, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptoccocus feacalis, and the stability of plasmid DNA was tested after cultivation in non-selective conditions.
TI  - In vivo effects of urease-producing bacteria involved with the pathogenesis of infection-induced urolithiasis on renal urokinase and sialidase activity.
AB  - Many hypotheses have been proposed for renal stone formation. It has been argued  that with infection-induced renal stones the hydrolysis of urea by bacterial urease increases urinary pH, with consequent stone formation. Unfortunately, this theory is not applicable to the micro-organisms that do not produce urease (e.g. Escherichia coli). It has been recently reported that E. coli reduces the urinary urokinase activity of male rats, but does not influence the urinary sialidase activity. This study has now been expanded to the urease-producing bacteria Proteus mirabilis, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Micrococcus luteus. Subcutaneous injections with these bacteria were found to significantly (P < 0.003) reduce the UK activity of extrarenally obstructed kidneys. The urease-producing mammalian skin bacterium, M. luteus, was, however, the exception (P = 0.1079). In contrast to S. epidermidis, P. aeruginosa and M. luteus (P < 0.0213), P. mirabilis and S. aureus had no effect on renal sialidase activity (P < 0.4047). These results may explain why Proteus species are predominant in infection-induced renal stones. According to the urokinase-sialidase hypothesis, a decrease in urinary urokinase activity should increase the uromucoid levels, whilst no effect on the urinary sialidase activity should favour conversion of urinary uromucoid to mineralizable matrix. These conditions may lead to renal stone formation. An increase in urinary pH resulting from urease-producing micro-organisms will increase salt precipitation on the uromucoid. It is thus concluded that urease-producing bacteria may play a double role in renal stone formation.
TI  - [Initiation of DNA replication in Streptomyces; organizational comparison of the  oriC region in prokaryotic organisms].
AB  - DnaA protein and its binding sequence (DnaA-box) are two elements essential for the initiation of chromosomal replication in Escherichia coli and other bacteria. Recently these two elements have been found to be conserved in four Gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, Mycoplasma capricolum and Streptomyces lividans). The structures of eubacterial DnaA-box regions and their locations on the chromosome and than functional aspects od DnaA protein have been compared.
TI  - Purification and partial characterization of an induced antibacterial protein in  the silkworm, Bombyx mori.
AB  - Injection of live Escherichia coli into larvae of the silkworm, Bombyx mori, induces antibacterial activity in the hemolymph. The major induced antibacterial activity was purified in two steps by CM-Sephadex C-50 and Sephadex G-100 column chromatography. After trypsin treatment, the purified antibacterial protein lost its activity and the antibacterial activity was found to be partially heat labile. The purified protein was a single polypeptide chain of molecular weight 16 kDa. The 20 N-terminal amino acid sequence of the protein was determined and this sequence showed homology with the N-terminal amino acid sequence of lysozymes reported in other species. The purified protein was found to have comparable antibacterial activity against both E. coli and Micrococcus luteus. The purification of antibacterial protein and the antibacterial properties of the purified protein are discussed.
TI  - Purification and characterization of the inhibitory subunit (delta) of the ATP-synthase from Micrococcus luteus.
AB  - Subunit delta was isolated from the ATP-synthase from Micrococcus luteus strain (ATCC 4698). delta, in the case of M. luteus F0F1-ATPase, acts as an inhibitor of ATP hydrolysis and thus resembles subunits in E. coli and chloroplast ATP-synthase. After treatment with 1.5 M LiCl the ATP-synthase dissociated, and subsequently subunit delta (27 kDa) was purified by hydrophobic interaction chromatography. Inhibition of ATP-synthase lacking delta by addition of delta showed non-competitive kinetics with a Ki of approximately 5.9 nM. Subunit epsilon from chloroplast F1, which corresponds functionally to the M. luteus F0F1-delta, and chloroplast delta were tested for ATPase inhibitory activity by addition to the partially delta-depleted ATP-synthase from M. luteus. CF1-epsilon inhibited M. luteus ATP-synthase up to 80%, whereas CF1-delta did not show any influence.
TI  - Antibacterial triterpenoid acids from Dillenia papuana.
AB  - Three new oleanene-type triterpenoids, dillenic acids A [1], B [2], and C [3], and two known compounds, 3-oxoolean-1,12-dien-30-oic acid [4] (a new natural product) and the lupene derivative betulinaldehyde, have been isolated from the Papua New Guinean medicinal plant Dillenia papuana. The structures of the new compounds were elucidated as 2 alpha-hydroxy-3-oxoolean-12-en-30-oic acid, 2-oxo-3 beta-hydroxyolean-12-en-30-oic acid and 1 alpha-hydroxy-3-oxoolean-12-en-30-oic acid. The 1H- and 13C-nmr data of all new compounds were assigned unambiguously using a variety of 2D nmr experiments including 1H-1H-COSY, HMQC, HMBC, and NOESY experiments. Of these compounds, 1-4 showed antibacterial activities against Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, and Micrococcus luteus.
TI  - Phylogenetic analysis of sequences from diverse bacteria with homology to the Escherichia coli rho gene.
AB  - Genes from Pseudomonas fluorescens, Chromatium vinosum, Micrococcus luteus, Deinococcus radiodurans, and Thermotoga maritima with homology to the Escherichia coli rho gene were cloned and sequenced, and their sequences were compared with other available sequences. The species for all of the compared sequences are members of five bacterial phyla, including Thermotogales, the most deeply diverged phylum. This suggests that a rho-like gene is ubiquitous in the Bacteria and was present in their common ancestor. The comparative analysis revealed that the Rho homologs are highly conserved, exhibiting a minimum identity of 50% of their amino acid residues in pairwise comparisons. The ATP-binding domain had a particularly high degree of conservation, consisting of some blocks with sequences of residues that are very similar to segments of the alpha and beta subunits of F1-ATPase and of other blocks with sequences that are unique to Rho. The RNA-binding domain is more diverged than the ATP-binding domain. However, one of its most highly conserved segments includes a RNP1-like sequence, which is known to be involved in RNA binding. Overall, the degree of similarity is lowest in the first 50 residues (the first half of the RNA-binding domain), in the putative connector region between the RNA-binding and the ATP-binding domains, and in the last 50 residues of the polypeptide. Since functionally defective mutants for E. coli Rho exist in all three of these segments, they represent important parts of Rho that have undergone adaptive evolution.
TI  - Production of UV-induced frameshift mutations in vitro by DNA polymerases deficient in 3'-->5' exonuclease activity.
AB  - In order to study the conversion of UV lesions into frameshift and base substitution mutations, M13mp2 phage DNA was altered by the addition of extra pyrimidines, or by construction of a nonsense codon preceded by a run of pyrimidines within the beta-galactosidase complementing region. The normal sequence 5' GTC GTT TTA CAA 3' was changed to GTC GTT T TTA CAA (MIDT) or GTC GTT C TTA CAA (MIDC) to study frameshifts and to GTC GTT CTT TAA (OCHRE) to study reversion of the ochre (TAA) codon. Escherichia coli pol I Kf and T7 DNA polymerase mutant enzymes devoid of 3'-->5' exonuclease activity produced UV-induced revertants at higher frequency than did their exonuclease proficient counterparts. Removal of cyclobutane dimers with photolyase before in vitro synthesis did not greatly affect mutant frequency although such treatment led to significantly increased DNA synthesis by the wild-type T7 DNA polymerase on UV-irradiated substrate. Reversions of the in frame ochre sequence GTT CTT TAA produced by the delta 28 T7 DNA polymerase were mainly by base substitution in the TAA codon. About half of the E. coli Kf exo- enzyme ochre revertants had a TTA deletion. Five mutant T7 DNA polymerases with varying exonuclease activity gave revertant frequencies that correlated better with published values of enzyme velocity than with exonuclease activity or with measured bypass synthesis. Our data indicate that loss of proofreading activity increases the frequency of UV-induced frameshifts, but lack of such activity is not sufficient for their production. We suggest that frameshifts occur more frequently when nucleotide addition opposite the lesion is slow. The same lesion can give rise to a different spectrum of mutations depending on the polymerase.
TI  - Alpha-deoxyadenosine, a major anoxic radiolysis product of adenine in DNA, is a substrate for Escherichia coli endonuclease IV.
AB  - Oligonucleotides containing a unique alpha-deoxyadenosine or tetrahydrofuran (a model abasic site) were synthesized using phosphoramidite chemistry. Repair enzymes from Escherichia coli, including endonucleases III, IV, and VIII, exonuclease III, formamidopyrimidine N-glycosylase, and deoxyinosine 3'-endonuclease, as well as UV dimer N-glycosylases from T4 (den V) and Micrococcus luteus, were examined for their ability to recognize alpha-deoxyadenosine and tetrahydrofuran. In agreement with prior studies, a tetrahydrofuran-containing oligonucleotide was a substrate for endonuclease IV and exonuclease III, but not for the other repair enzymes. However, an oligonucleotide containing alpha-deoxyadenine was a substrate only for endonuclease IV. Competitive inhibition studies with both substrates confirmed that the activity recognizing alpha-deoxyadenine was endonuclease IV and not a possible contaminant in the endonuclease IV preparation. Using E. coli extracts, the activity that recognized alpha-deoxyadenine was dependent on nfo, the structural gene of endonuclease IV, further substantiating that endonuclease IV is the enzyme that recognized alpha-deoxyadenine. Kinetic measurements indicated that alpha-deoxyadenosine was as good a substrate for endonuclease IV as tetrahydrofuran; the Km and Vmax values for both substrates were similar. Using substrates that were labeled at either the 3'- or 5'-terminus, endonuclease IV was shown to hydrolyze the phosphodiester bond 5' to either alpha-deoxyadenosine or tetrahydrofuran, leaving the lesion, alpha-deoxyadenosine or tetrahydrofuran, on the 5'-terminus of the nicked site. The ability of endonuclease IV to recognize alpha-deoxyadenosine suggests that endonuclease IV is able to recognize a new class of DNA base lesions that is not recognized by other DNA N-glycosylases and AP endonucleases.
TI  - [Bacteria-reducing properties of copper-containing and non-copper-containing materials. II. Relationship between microbiocide effect of copper-containing materials and copper ion concentration after contamination with moist and dry hands].
AB  - The bactericide quality of different materials containing copper (copper, brass,  brass-sheet) was tested and particularly the effect of humidity and copper-concentration was examined. In first examinations (I. communication) (19) the materials were contaminated by hands, which were dipped into a suspension of different microorganisms (Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa). The survival rate of the microorganisms on the surfaces was determined after defined exposure times (0, 5, 30, 60, 120 min). The following ways of contaminating the test materials were chosen: single contamination with wet hands, repeated contamination with wet and dry hands. In this examination the results were tested for statistical significance and in parallel experiments the copper-concentration on the surfaces of the materials was determined. Materials containing copper contaminated with wet hands show a significant bactericide effect after an exposure time of 120 min. The bactericide effect on Micrococcus luteus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa is inhibited after contamination with dry hands. This results can not be explained by a different copper-concentration on the surfaces of the materials, because a statistically significant difference of copper-ion concentrations between contamination with wet and dry hands could not be obtained.
TI  - Cloning and sequence determination of the gene coding for the elongation factor Tu of Mycobacterium leprae.
AB  - Elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu) plays an important role in protein biosynthesis and  is susceptible to antibiotics in prokaryotes like Escherichia coli. In order to understand the primary structure of EF-Tu in the intracellular pathogenic bacterium Mycobacterium leprae, the gene (tuf gene) coding for this protein was cloned and sequenced. The gene contains a coding region of 1,188 bp with GUG as start codon. The deduced amino acid sequence has 396 amino acids with a molecular weight of 43.6 kDa. Putative GTP-binding sites are located at amino acid positions 19-24, 83-87, and 138-141. Comparison of M. leprae EF-Tu amino acid sequence with those of M. tuberculosis, Micrococcus luteus, E. coli, and Salmonella typhimurium reveals 74-95% homology. Mitochondrial EF-Tu of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (62%) and chloroplast EF-Tu of Arabidopsis thalina (65.6%) also show strong homology with that of M. leprae. In contrast, the EF-Tu of the archaebacterium Halobacterium marismoruti exhibits relatively less homology (36.7%). Southern hybridization of M. leprae tuf gene with genomic DNA of slow growing and fast growing mycobacteria and related species like Corynebacterium fascians and Nocardia asteroides suggests that the gene is highly conserved in these organisms.
TI  - Cytotoxic and antibacterial dihydrochalcones from Piper aduncum.
AB  - Bioactivity-guided fractionation of a CH2Cl2 extract from the leaves of Piper aduncum afforded three new dihydrochalcones, piperaduncins A [3], B [4], and C [5], as well as two known dihydrochalcones, 2',6'-dihydroxy-4'-methoxydihydrochalcone [1] and 2',6',4-trihydroxy-4'-methoxydihydrochalcone [2] (asebogenin), together with sakuranetin, anodendroic acid methyl ester, and the carotenoid lutein. The structures of the isolates were elucidated by spectroscopic methods, mainly 1D- and 2D nmr spectroscopy. The proposed stereochemistry for compound 4 was deduced by NOESY spectroscopy and the corresponding energy minimum was established by molecular modelling calculations and translated into a 3D structure.
TI  - Bactericidal activity in the pig roundworm Ascaris suum.
AB  - A potent, humoral, bactericidal activity against Micrococcus luteus was discovered in pseudocoelomic fluid of the pig roundworm, Ascaris suum. The activity, which was not bacteriolytic, was not due to lysozyme or to a dietary antibiotic. It was not inactivated by exposure to 100 degrees C, to low or high pH, or to ethanol. Dialysis, electrophoresis and agar-diffusion experiments suggested that the main antibacterial activity in the fluid was associated with a basic substance of molecular weight somewhat less than 14,000 Da. Two other Gram-positive organisms, Bacillus megaterium and Staphylococcus aureus, were also killed by the Ascaris fluid, but the Gram-negative Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris and Bordetella bronchiseptica were insensitive.
TI  - Cyclothialidine, a novel DNA gyrase inhibitor. I. Screening, taxonomy, fermentation and biological activity.
AB  - Streptomyces filipinensis NR 0484 produced a new DNA gyrase inhibitor, cyclothialidine. It showed potent activity against DNA gyrases from Escherichia coli and Micrococcus luteus.

TI  - Induction of antibacterial protein synthesis by soluble peptidoglycan in isolated fat body from larvae of the silkworm, Bombyx mori.
AB  - Synthesis and secretion of bactericidal protein (cecropin) and lysozyme were induced by soluble peptidoglycan fragments (SPG) from Escherichia coli in a culture of fat body from Bombyx mori larvae. The rate of the secretion by fat body increased as a function of SPG concentration added to the culture medium. The induction of bactericidal activity was specific for peptidoglycan of a particular structure. Thus, SPG from Micrococcus luteus was 500-times less potent than E. coli SPG, and various glucans and peptides structurally related to peptidoglycan were all ineffective as elicitor. These results support the hypothesis that bacteria invading the haemocoel have to be partially degraded to generate peptidoglycan fragments as a signal molecule, which subsequently acts on a receptor on fat body cells and induces antibacterial protein synthesis.

AB  - In this examination the bactericide qualities of different materials were tested. Particularly the effect of humidity was examined. 3 materials containing copper ("copper", "brass" and "brass sheet") and 2 materials not containing copper ("polyamide B" and "high-grade steel") were tested. The surfaces of the 5 types of material were contaminated with a suspension of 2 different bacteria species (Staphylococcus aureus and Micrococcus luteus). After defined exposure times the survival rate of the microorganisms on the surfaces was determined by the standardized method of the "Guidelines of the German Society of Hygiene and Microbiology". Additionally the sedimentation of airborne microorganisms on the materials was tested by determining the number of colony-forming-units after defined exposure times. In further examinations the materials were contaminated by hands, which were dipped into a suspension of different microorganisms (Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). The following ways of contaminating the test materials were chosen: single contamination with wet hands, repeated contamination with wet and dry hands. After defined exposure times the survival rate of the microorganisms on the surfaces was determined. The results show, a bactericide quality of copper depends on the percent of copper-content of the tested materials, exposure time, humidity, frequency of contamination and bacteria species. Humidity and only single contamination cause a reduction of bacteria. Reduction of gram-negative bacteria is more easily than reduction of gram-positive bacteria. Enterococcus faecium shows the highest, Pseudomonas aeruginosa the lowest reduction rate of bacteria in the following sequence: Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Molecular cloning, sequence analysis, and characterization of a new cell wall hydrolase, CwlL, of Bacillus licheniformis.
AB  - We have cloned a DNA fragment containing the gene for a cell wall hydrolase from  Bacillus licheniformis FD0120 into Escherichia coli. Sequencing of the fragment showed the presence of an open reading frame (ORF; designated as cwlL), which is different from the B. licheniformis cell wall hydrolase gene cwlM, and encodes a polypeptide of 360 amino acids with a molecular mass of 38,994. The enzyme purified from the E. coli clone is an N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase, which has a M(r) value of 41 kDa as determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and is able to digest B. licheniformis, B. subtilis and Micrococcus luteus cell walls. The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of cwlL are very similar to those of ORF3 in the putative operon xpaL1-xpaL2-ORF3 in B. licheniformis MC14. Moreover, the amino acid sequence homology of CwlL with the B. subtilis amidase CwlA indicates two evolutionarily distinguishable regions in CwlL. The sequence homology of CwlL with other cell wall hydrolases and the regulation of cwlL are discussed.
TI  - [Effect of ozone on airborne microorganisms].
AB  - The microbicidal effect of ozone in air was tested at concentrations between 50 and 600 micrograms/m3 against the species: Staphylococcus epidermidis, Micrococcus luteus, Arthrobacter citreus, Bacillus subtilis (veg.), Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas fluorescens and Candida albicans. The microorganisms were exposed on membrane filters at 60-75% relative humidity and 21.5-22.5 degrees C. After exposure times between 1 min and 60 min, the filters were incubated on appropriate agar media. The effect of ozone was determined by comparing the number of colonies on exposed filters to the number on nonexposed filters. The die-off curves (colony count against time) proved not to be rectilinear, but to become steeper with increasing time of exposure. Furthermore, the velocity of reduction increased more than proportional with increasing concentration of ozone. Therefore, the bacterial decay seems not to follow first order reaction kinetics. The values presented for k (constant of the velocity of die-off) and D (decimal reduction time) are valid only for narrow ranges of the initial part of the exposure. Concentrations of 50 to 100 micrograms (0)3/m3 for 1 h resulted only in little reduction, whereas 500 to 600 micrograms/m3 for one hour led to 99% reduction in all bacterial species tested. The gram-positive species seemed to be more sensitive than the gram-negative species, C. albicans proved to be more resistant than the bacteria.
TI  - Purification and characterization of a scorpion defensin, a 4kDa antibacterial peptide presenting structural similarities with insect defensins and scorpion toxins.
AB  - Insect defensins are a group of inducible small-sized antibacterial peptides with three intramolecular disulfide bridges. NMR studies have recently shown that they share striking structural similarities with scorpion toxins. We have investigated in a scorpion species, Leiurus quinquestriatus, the potential presence of antibacterial molecules and report the isolation and structural characterization of a novel insect defensin homologue, which we refer to as scorpion defensin. This peptide shows a remarkably high degree of sequence homology with a defensin recently characterized in a species belonging to the ancient insect order of the Odonata with which it defines a novel ancient subclass of defensins. The scorpion defensin has in common with the scorpion toxins a consensus sequence Cys-[...]-Cys-Xaa-Xaa-Xaa-Cys-[...]-Gly-Xaa-Cys-[...]-Cys-Xaa-Cys present in all scorpion toxins characterized so far.
TI  - Stereo (C7)-dependent topoisomerase II inhibition and tumor growth suppression by a new quinolone, BO-2367.
AB  - A new antimicrobial quinolone (-)BO-2367, (-)-7-[(1R*, 2R*, 6R*)-2-amino-8-azabicyclo[4.3.0.]-non-3-en-8-yl]-1- cyclopropyl-6,8-difluoro-1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-3-quinolinecarboxylic acid, strongly inhibited both mammalian and bacterial topoisomerase II. The IC50 values of (-)BO-2367 against the DNA relaxation activity of L1210 topoisomerase II and the supercoiling activities of Escherichia coli gyrase and Micrococcus luteus gyrase were 3.8, 0.5, and 1 microM, respectively. This compound enhanced double-stranded DNA cleavage mediated by topoisomerase II not only with purified enzyme, but also with intact L1210 cells. All these activities of (-)BO-2367 were more than 2-fold stronger than those of VP-16. Intriguingly, (+)BO-2367, which has an enantiomeric substituent at the C7 position of (-)BO-2367, did not affect the activity of the mammalian topoisomerase II, while it inhibited E. coli gyrase. Intraperitoneal injection of (-)BO-2367 at 0.08 mg/kg increased the lifespan of CDF1 female mice bearing ascitic L1210 leukemia by 2.4 times, and subcutaneous injection at 1.25 mg/kg completely inhibited the growth of colon 26 carcinoma implanted subcutaneously. These results suggest that (-)BO-2367 is a potent antitumor agent which targets topoisomerase II. These enantiomers should be a useful tool for studying drug-topoisomerase II interactions.
TI  - Structural similarities between M. luteus and E. coli DNA topoisomerase I.
AB  - Type I DNA topoisomerase has been isolated from Micrococcus luteus following a procedure that takes advantage of the binding of the enzyme to heparin and single stranded DNA. Almost pure enzyme was obtained using two successive affinity chromatography steps: on heparin Sepharose and ssDNA cellulose. The method was rapid and allowed the isolation of DNA topoisomerase I from M. luteus in mg quantities. Polyclonal antibodies raised in rabbit were shown to cross-react with type I DNA topoisomerase of Escherichia coli. Partial protein sequencing of the M. luteus enzyme identified a peptide with high similarity to the putative protein sequence of E. coli DNA topoisomerase I, aligning with 73% identity to amino acids 491-505.
TI  - The antimicrobial activity in vitro of chlorhexidine, a mixture of isothiazolinones ('Kathon' CG) and cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB).
AB  - Chlorehexidine, two 4% chlorhexidine antiseptic handwashes ('Bioprep' and 'Hibiclens'), cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) and isothiazolinones ('Kathon') were tested against Staphylococcus aureus, Micrococcus luteus, Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus vulgaris and Candida albicans. The activities measured were the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), minimum microbicidal concentration (MMC), rate of kill in water and broth, effect of organic soil, the development of microbial resistance on continuous exposure and agent bioavailability in media and formulation. 'Kathon' was the most active microbistatic agent showing maximal activity at low concentration, least inactivation by organic soil and media components and the lowest level of development of bacterial resistance. It was synergistic with chlorhexidine against S. marcescens and P. aeruginosa. Media, formulation components and organic soil affected the performance of chlorhexidine and CTAB. Chlorhexidine was more broadly active than CTAB but showed a greater reduction in activity in the presence of soil and engendered a greater level of bacterial resistance. It was more rapidly bactericidal to P. aeruginosa and S. marcescens than to S. aureus. Stable resistance to chlorhexidine and CTAB was developed by P. aeruginosa and S. marcescens, the latter showing the higher level of resistance. Chlorhexidine-resistant strains were also resistant to CTAB. The antiseptic formulations were more rapidly bactericidal than chlorhexidine alone but were otherwise of comparable activity. Mixtures of disinfectants, in particular a combination of chlorhexidine and a preservative level of 'Kathon', were more active than single disinfectants. The importance of standardization of media and test conditions and the use of chemically defined media for accurate and reproducible in-vitro testing of disinfectant activity is emphasized. Disinfection kinetics, expressed as time-kill curves, log reduction factors or decimal reduction times were shown to be valuable in differentiating microbistatic from microbicidal activity, showing the effects of dilution and soil on activity and indicating possible different mechanisms of action.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity determined in strains of Bacillus circulans cluster.
AB  - Wild-type strains of the genus Bacillus were screened for antimicrobial activity. Two strains exhibited antimicrobial activity against Micrococcus luteus and were identified as Bacillus polymyxa MIR-23 and Bacillus circulans MIR-13. Bacillus polymyxa MIR-23 was active against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Aspergillus niger, whereas Bacillus circulans MIR-13 did not show activity against these microorganisms. Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633 and B. polymyxa ATCC 10401 were used as standard antibiotic-producer strain and showed different antimicrobial profiles and yields from B. polymyxa MIR-23. The different antimicrobial profile of the two selected strains could possibly be used as a taxonomic marker.
TI  - Characterization of microbial flora of leprous ulcers infested with maggots.
AB  - Swabs from 64 maggot infested leprosy ulcers before and after treatment for maggots and 100 non-infested leprosy ulcers were studied for the bacterial flora. From maggot infested ulcers (before treatment), the cultures usually showed mixed growth. Among the Gram positive isolates, Staphylococcus aureus (37%), S. albus (18%) and Streptococcus pyogenes (36%) were frequently isolated. Gram negative bacteria isolated were Proteus spp. (21%) and Escherichia coli (7%). Anaerobic bacteria isolated were Micrococcus (3%) and Bacteroides (4%). After treatment of maggot infested ulcers, S. aureus (36%) continued to be isolated with almost the same frequency. The isolates of other Gram negative organisms were slightly reduced. Among the Gram negatives the Proteus spp. (10%) were also less in number. In few cases Neisseria (3%) was found. Anaerobic isolates were M. luteus (2%) and B. necrophorus (3%). From the cases without maggot infestation, a single organism was isolated from 16 cases and 84 mixed cultures were obtained. Isolates included the aerobic Gram positives S. aureus (46%), S. albus (21%) and S. pyogenes (38%), and the Gram negative Proteus spp. (19%) and E. coli (7%). The anaerobic isolate was M. luteus (3%). From this study no apparent association between the type of bacterial flora and maggot infestation could be observed.
TI  - The ability of bacteria to synthesize a new cyclopyrophosphate correlates with their tolerance to redox-cycling drugs: on a crossroad of chemotherapy, environmental toxicology and immunobiochemical problems.
AB  - Many redox-cyclers were recently shown to induce, in some bacterial species, large-scale biosynthesis of a new 2-methylbutan-1,2,3,4-tetraol-2,4-cyclopyrophosphate believed to be involved in anti-stress reactions. In the present study Mycobacterium smegmatis, Micrococcus luteus and Brevibacterium ammoniagenes were shown to begin synthesis of the new cyclopyrophosphate when cultivated in a medium containing furacilin or furadonin (widely used nitrofuran antibacterial drugs) and to maintain close to normal growth rates, whereas Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli were inhibited by the drugs and were unable to synthesize the cyclopyrophosphate compound. Preferential binding of Mg2+ and Cd2+ with one or other phosphoryl groups of the cyclopyrophosphate, which was indicated by selective changes of 31P-NMR chemical shifts and intramolecular hydrogen bonding, is suggested as a reason for this selectivity.
TI  - The effect of ribosomal protein S1 from Escherichia coli and Micrococcus luteus on protein synthesis in vitro by E. coli and Bacillus subtilis.
AB  - We have designed a set of nine plasmids containing the Bacillus pumilis cat gene  with one of three Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequences (weak, strong or stronger) and one of three initiation codons (AUG, GUG or UUG). These constructions have been used to determine the effect of ribosomal protein S1, SD and initiation codon sequences and Escherichia coli ribosomal protein S1 on translation in vitro by E. coli and B. subtilis ribosomes. Translation of these nine constructions was determined with three types of ribosomes: E. coli containing ribosomal protein S1, E. coli depleted of S1, and B. subtilis which is naturally free of S1. E. coli ribosomes were able to translate all nine transcripts with variable efficiencies. B. subtilis and S1-depleted E. coli ribosomes were similar to each other and differed from non-depleted E. coli ribosomes in that they required strong or stronger SD sequences and were unable to translate any of the weak transcripts. Addition of S1 from either E. coli or Micrococcus luteus, a Gram-positive bacterium, enabled S1-depleted E. coli ribosomes to translate mRNAs with weak SD sequences but had no effect on B. subtilis ribosomes. AUG was the preferred initiation codon for all ribosome types; however, B. subtilis ribosomes showed greater tolerance for the non-AUG codons than either type of E. coli ribosome. The presence of a strong or stronger SD sequence increased the efficiency by which E. coli ribosomes could utilize non-AUG codons.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [The determination of the discrepancy between the mathematically ascertained and  experimentally provable efficiency of UV facilities for water disinfection].
AB  - Using three UV-plants of different technical designs for water disinfection, we studied the conformity between experimental germ reduction using standard test organisms and calculated UV-doses under various water flow conditions. Taking into consideration the style of construction of the UV-plants, the irradiation area and the layer thickness were used as constant parameters for dose calculations. This was also employed for the irradiation intensity, since the experiments were performed for a relatively short period compared of the life span of the UV-irradiators. Both exposure time and water transmission were employed as variable parameters in the dose calculations and experimental procedures respectively. The calculated UV-dose and experimentally obtained germ reduction values were comparatively the same for two of the three UV-plants studied. However, no correlation was observed between the reduction of E. coli and the corresponding calculated UV-dose values. Therefore, the calculated UV-dose values for any given UV-plant should be considered to be relative and by no means absolute values. We are of the opinion that within a certain range of water flow rate and transmission, antimicrobial effectiveness of different UV-plants should be demonstrated independent of dose values, technical and other construction characteristics. The applicability of the UV-plants studied is discussed.
TI  - [Isolation and evaluation of the structure of the new anthracycline antibiotics rubomycins F and H].
AB  - The rubomycin complex produced by Streptomyces coeruleorubidus 4-157 was studied  and the two novel anthracyclines i.e. rubomycins F and H were isolated. The study of the physicochemical properties of the novel antibiotics in comparison with rubomycin C (daunomycin) and the specially prepared 3'-N-carbmethoxyrubomycin C showed that rubomycin F was 3'-N-carbethoxydaunomycin and rubomycin H was 3'-N-carbmethoxydaunomycin. Therefore, rubomycins F and H are novel representatives of natural anthracyclines undescribed previously.
TI  - Genetic structure, isolation and characterization of a Bacillus licheniformis cell wall hydrolase.
AB  - A DNA fragment containing the gene for a cell wall hydrolase of Bacillus licheniformis was cloned into Escherichia coli. Sequencing of the fragment showed the presence of an open reading frame which encodes a polypeptide of 253 amino acids with a molecular mass of 27,513. The gene was designated as cwlM, for cell wall lysis. The deduced amino acid sequence indicated that there is a repeated sequence consisting of 33 amino acid residues in the C-terminal region. Deletion of the C-terminal region did not lead to any loss of cell wall lytic activity. The gene product purified from E. coli cells harboring a cwlM-bearing plasmid exhibited a M(r) value of 29 kDa on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and characterization of the specific substrate bond cleaved by CWLM indicated that the enzyme is an N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase (EC 3.5.1.28). The enzyme hydrolyzed the cell wall of Micrococcus luteus more efficiently than those of B. licheniformis and B. subtilis, but the truncated CWLM (lacking the C-terminal region) had lost this preference. CWLM prepared from B. subtilis cells harboring a plasmid containing cwlM had a similar M(r) value to that from E. coli. Amino acid sequence homologies between CWLM and other amidases, and their protein structures are discussed.
TI  - Substrate specificity of isopenicillin N synthase.
AB  - Highly purified isopenicillin N synthase (IPNS) from two sources (naturally occurring in Penicillium chrysogenum and that expressed in Escherichia coli via a cloned gene derived from Cephalosporium acremonium) have been isolated and utilized in vitro to test synthetic modifications of the natural substrate, (L-alpha-amino-delta-adipyl)-L-cysteinyl-D-valine (ACV). A very sensitive procedure utilizing the ability of beta-lactams to induce the synthesis of beta-lactamase was employed to determine whether an ACV analogue could serve as a substrate for IPNS. A wide variety of amino and carboxyl terminal tripeptide substitutions were examined and found to elicit positive beta-lactamase induction profiles. However, none of these modifications were found to function as efficiently as a substrate as ACV. One of the beta-lactam products which was formed from the reaction of IPNS and the tripeptide analogue was independently synthesized and evaluated for antibacterial activity. Modification of the L-cysteine residue in the second position of ACV resulted in tripeptides that were unable to serve as substrates. Conversion of the D-valine residue in the third position of ACV to an aromatic amino acid or to a highly electronegative residue such as trifluorovaline resulted in elimination of substrate activity and creation of an inhibitor of the enzyme.
TI  - A eukaryotic DNA glycosylase/lyase recognizing ultraviolet light-induced pyrimidine dimers.
AB  - Cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) are the predominant product of photodamage in DNA after exposure of cells to ultraviolet light and are cytotoxic, mutagenic and carcinogenic in a variety of cellular and animal systems. In prokaryotes, enzymes and protein complexes have been characterized that remove or reverse CPDs in DNA. Micrococcus luteus and T4 phage-infected Escherichia coli contain a specific N-glycosylase/apurinic-apyrimidinic lyase that catalyses a two-step DNA incision process at sites of CPDs, thus initiating base excision repair of these lesions. It is well established that CPDs are recognized and removed from eukaryotic DNA by excision repair processes but very little information exists concerning the nature of the proteins involved in CPD recognition and DNA incision events. We report here that an enzyme functionally similar to the prokaryotic N-glycosylase/apurinic-apyrimidinic lyases exists in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. To our knowledge, this is the first time such an activity has been found in a eukaryote and is also the first example of an organism having both direct reversal and base excision repair pathways for the removal of CPDs from DNA.
TI  - Structure of the gene complementing uvr-402 in Streptococcus pneumoniae: homology with Escherichia coli uvrB and the homologous gene in Micrococcus luteus.
AB  - The repair ability for UV-induced damage observed for Streptococcus pneumoniae proceeds through a system similar to the Uvr-dependent system in Escherichia coli. The DNA sequence of a gene complementing uvr-402, a mutation conferring UV sensitivity, was determined. Alignments of the deduced amino acid sequence revealed an extensive sequence homology of 55% with the UvrB protein of E. coli and 59% with the UvrB-homologous protein of Micrococcus luteus. Nucleotide-binding site consensus was observed. The high conservation of the uvrB-like gene among these three species suggests that the role of the UvrB protein and excision repair in general might be very important for cell survival.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of sphingosines.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of stratum corneum lipids was examined by screening in vitro various representative phospholipids and sphingolipids. Of mixed galacto-cerebrosides; phosphatidic acid; phosphatidic acid-monomethylester-dioleoyl; phosphatidylethanolamine; phosphatidylethanolamine-beta-oleoyl-gamma-palmitoyl; phosphatidylcholine; D-sphingosine; D,L-sphinganine; 4-D-hydroxysphinganine; oleoyl-sphingosine; N,N-dimethylsphingosine; and stearylamine, only the sphingosines and, to a lesser extent, stearylamine were clearly and profoundly effective against Staphylococcus aureus (4-log reduction at 6.25 micrograms/ml [20 microM]; 2-log reduction at 0.78 mu/ml [2.5 microM]). The sphingosines were similarly active against Streptococcus pyogenes, Micrococcus luteus, Propionibacterium acnes, Brevibacterium epidermidis, and Candida albicans, moderately active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and ineffective against Escherichia coli and Serratia marcescens. Both erythro- and threo-isomers were effective. Optimal inhibition was at 60 min incubation at 37 degrees C and at pH 6.5. Antimicrobial activity, which was Ca++ dependent, was confirmed in vivo by topical application and microbial challenge. Because free sphingosines are available in the stratum corneum and other epidermal layers, these lipids may contribute to the cutaneous antimicrobial barrier.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of C9-deficient human serum.
AB  - Escherichia coli B/SM, strain 1-1, was killed dose dependently by human hereditary C9-deficient serum (C9DHS), which was shown to contain no C9 Ag by an ELISA method. On the other hand, human hereditary C7-deficient serum did not kill the bacteria under similar conditions. The bactericidal activity of C9DHS was inhibited by rabbit anti-C5 antibody but not by murine anti-C9 mAb. The anti-C9 antibody decreased the bactericidal activity of normal human serum (NHS) to the level of that with C9DHS. Sheep anti-human lysozyme antibody did not affect the bactericidal activity of C9DHS or NHS even when added at more than twice the concentration required to block the serum lysozyme activity on Micrococcus luteus. After treatment with C9DHS and washing, surviving Escherichia coli were killed by C9, but not by lysozyme, transferrin, or both. Other strains of E. coli (K12 W3110, C600, and NIHJ) and Salmonella typhimurium (strain NCTC 74), all maintained in the laboratory, were also killed by C9DHS. However, pathogenic strains recently isolated from patients with traveler's diarrhea and some strains of S. typhimurium were resistant to both C9DHS and NHS, at least at the serum concentration tested. A concentration of 0.1 M Tris did not increase the susceptibility of serum-resistant strains of bacteria to C9DHS, but made one strain of S. typhimurium tested susceptible to NHS, but not to C9DHS. These results clearly showed that C9DHS kills bacteria that are sensitive to NHS through activation of C up to the step of C8 in the same way that C9-deficient C serum lyzed sensitized erythrocytes.
TI  - Parasitological and microbiological evaluation of Mixe Indian medicinal plants (Mexico).
AB  - Medicinal plants are an important health resource in many regions of the Americas and are of particular importance to many Indian communities. Based on a recent ethnobotanical study in Mexico, we investigated the activity of 29 plant extracts against Entamoeba histolytica, three bacteria (Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, and Micrococcus luteus) and two fungi (Cladosporium cucumerinum and Penicillium oxalicum). After separation of these extracts between CH2Cl2 and H2O the resulting phases were also evaluated.
TI  - Structure of the dnaA and DnaA-box region in the Mycoplasma capricolum chromosome: conservation and variations in the course of evolution.
AB  - We have previously shown that the dnaA gene and the DnaA-box region were conserved in bacteria representative of all three major branches of the eubacterial phylogenic tree: high G + C Gram+, low-G + C Gram+ and Gram-. In the present work, we determined the structure of the dnaA region of Mycoplasma capricolum and found that the dnaA gene and at least two other genes, rpmH and dnaN, were conserved in this bacterium. An unusually high level of amino acid (aa) substitutions was observed in M. capricolum DnaA. It was the case even in those aa which were well conserved in other bacterial species. The nontranslatable region upstream from the dnaA gene was also conserved in this bacterium, as it was universally found in both Gram+ and Gram- bacteria. An additional nontranslatable region downstream from the dnaA gene, which is common to Gram+ bacteria, was also found in M. capricolum, consistent with the proposal that M. capricolum is Gram+ in origin. These regions were rich in A + T and contained ten DnaA-box-like sequences (9-mers that differ from TTATCCACA by one or two bases).
TI  - UV endonuclease-mediated enhancement of UV survival in Micrococcus luteus: evidence revealed by deficiency in the Uvr homolog.
AB  - Unlike its phage T4 counterpart (also known as endonuclease V), Micrococcus luteus UV endonuclease (pyrimidine dimer DNA glycosylase/apurinic-apyrimidinic endonuclease) has suffered from lack of genetic evidence to implicate it in the promotion of UV survival of the cell, i.e., mutants with its deficiency are no more UV-sensitive than the wild type. On the assumption that the contribution of UV endonuclease is obscured by the presence of a homolog of Escherichia coli UvrABC endonuclease, which has recently been identified in this bacterium, survival studies were carried out in its absence. With 254-nm UV irradiation, which generates not only pyrimidine dimers but also 6-4 photoproducts as lethal lesions, a double mutant defective in both UV endonuclease and the Uvr homolog was shown to be more sensitive than a single mutant defective only in the latter, with a dose reduction factor of approximately 2 at the survival level of 37%. Furthermore, molecular photosensitization, which produces only pyrimidine dimers, revealed an even greater difference in sensitivity, the dose reduction factor being about 3.4. These results indicate that the contribution to cell survival of UV endonuclease, an enzyme specific for pyrimidine dimers, is manifest if the backup by the Uvr homolog is absent.
TI  - Structure and function of DnaA and the DnaA-box in eubacteria: evolutionary relationships of bacterial replication origins.
AB  - DnaA protein (a trans-acting element) and its binding sequence, DnaA-box: (a cis-acting element) are two elements essential for the initiation of chromosomal replication in Escherichia coli and other enteric bacteria. Recently these two elements have been found to be conserved in three Gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus and Mycoplasma capricolum) as well as in Gram-negative pseudomonads. DnaA protein was also found to be essential in the initiation of the replication of the B. subtilis chromosome, and regions containing multiple repeats of DnaA-box (DnaA-box region) are found to be active as autonomously replicating elements both in B. subtilis and pseudomonads. In this MicroReview we compare first the structures of these DnaA-box regions and their locations on the chromosome and then functional aspects of DnaA protein and DnaA-box regions in the initiation and regulation of chromosomal replication. From these observations we propose evolutionary relationships between replication origins of eubacteria.
TI  - Quantifying heterogeneity: flow cytometry of bacterial cultures.
AB  - Flow cytometry is a technique which permits the characterisation of individual cells in populations, in terms of distributions in their properties such as DNA content, protein content, viability, enzyme activities and so on. We review the technique, and some of its recent applications to microbiological problems. It is concluded that cellular heterogeneity, in both batch and continuous axenic cultures, is far greater than is normally assumed. This has important implications for the quantitative analysis of microbial processes.
TI  - Protein synthesis in vitro by Micrococcus luteus.
AB  - Bacillus subtilis and related gram-positive bacteria which have low to moderate genomic G + C contents are unable to efficiently translate mRNA derived from gram-negative bacteria, whereas Escherichia coli and other gram-negative bacteria are able to translate mRNA from both types of organisms. This phenomenon has been termed translational species specificity. Ribosomes from the low-G + C-content group (low-G + C group) of gram-positive organisms (B. subtilis and relatives) lack an equivalent to Escherichia ribosomal protein S1. The requirement for S1 for translation in E. coli (G. van Dieijen, P. H. van Knippenberg, J. van Duin, B. Koekman, and P. H. Pouwels, Mol. Gen. Genet. 153:75-80, 1977) and its specific role (A.R. Subramanian, Trends Biochem. Sci. 9:491-494, 1984) have been proposed. The group of gram-positive bacteria characterized by high genomic G + C content (formerly Actinomyces species and relatives) contain S1, in contrast to the low-G + C group (K. Mikulik, J. Smardova, A. Jiranova, and P. Branny, Eur. J. Biochem. 155:557-563, 1986). It is not known whether members of the high-G + C group are translationally specific, although there is evidence that one genus, Streptomyces, can express Escherichia genes in vivo (M. J. Bibb and S. N. Cohen, Mol. Gen. Genet. 187:265-277, 1985; J. L. Schottel, M. J. Bibb, and S. N. Cohen, J. Bacteriol. 146:360-368, 1981). In order to determine whether the organisms of this group are translationally specific, we examined the in vitro translational characteristics of a member of the high-G + C group, Micrococcus luteus, whose genomic G + C content is 73%. A semipurified coupled transcription-translation system of M. luteus translates Escherichia mRNA as well as Bacillus and Micrococcus mRNA. Therefore, M. luteus is translationally nonspecific and resembles E. coli rather than B. subtilis in its translational characteristics.
TI  - The occurrence and growth of microorganisms during the fermentation of fish sausage.
AB  - Minced fish (mullet) sausage mixes containing added sugar, salt, nitrate, nitrite and spices were fermented (48 h, 30 degrees C) by indigenous flora or by a starter culture (Pediococcus acidilactici) and the microbial ecology and behaviour of various bacteria was monitored. Pediococcus pentosaceus and Lactobacillus plantarum dominated the indigenous fermentation, achieving populations of 10(7)-10(8) cfu/g by 48 h, and decreasing the pH of the mix to 4.5-4.7. Significant growth (10(5)-10(7) cfu/g) of Staphylococcus warneri, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis. Micrococcus varians and Micrococcus luteus also occurred during this fermentation. Less growth was exhibited by Bacillus megaterium and yeasts. Pediococcus acidilactici dominated the fermentation when it was inoculated as a starter culture, but indigenous lactic acid bacteria (P. pentosaceus and L. plantarum) also grew to 10(7)-10(8) cfu/g. The growth of other bacteria and yeasts was restricted during fermentation with starter culture. Inoculated Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Salmonella sofia, and Staphylococcus aureus grew to 10(6)-10(7) cfu/g in the sausage mix during indigenous fermentation. Lesser growth occurred for Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens and Vibrio parahaemolyticus. Growth of these bacteria was significantly inhibited in sausage mix fermented with P. acidilactici.
TI  - Presence of a gene in the archaebacterium Methanococcus vannielii homologous to secY of eubacteria.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of a gene located at the promoter-distal side of the 'spectinomycin-operon' homologue of the archaebacterium Methanococcus vannielii was determined. Its derived amino acid sequence displayed 20% (identical positions) or 52% (including conservative exchanges) similarity, respectively, to SECY from E coli. An alignment of the Methanococcus SECY with eubacterial SECY sequences showed the existence of 10 membrane-associated primary structure domains in equivalent positions. The 5' and 3' ends of the secY transcript were mapped and the gene was expressed in the T7 promoter/polymerase system in E col. The temperature-sensitive growth of the E coli mutant IQ292 which harbours a secYts mutation could be complemented by the secY gene from Methanococcus. This indicates that a protein integral to an archaebacterial ether-lipid membrane can be inserted into a eubacterial phospholipid membrane without apparent loss of function.
TI  - Identification and characterization of RNA polymerase sigma factor from Micrococcus luteus.
AB  - The promoters of Micrococcus luteus, a bacterium whose chromosomal DNA has a high G + C content (74%), diverge from the consensus prokaryotic promoter in having GC-rich DNA sequences at less important positions (Nakayama, M., Fujita, N., Ohama, T., Osawa, S., and Ishihama, A. (1989) Mol. Gen. Genet. 218, 384-389). In order to compare the promoter selectivity of RNA polymerase between M. luteus and Escherichia coli, we purified the enzyme from both organisms. The sets of promoters recognized by the two RNA polymerases were found to overlap partly. Some, but not all, E. coli promoters were found to be correctly transcribed in vitro by M. luteus RNA polymerase as well as the E. coli enzyme. One molecular species of M. luteus sigma factor, with the apparent molecular mass of 60 kDa, was isolated from purified RNA polymerase. By the addition of either M. luteus or E. coli core enzyme it was reconstituted into active holoenzyme. Likewise, M. luteus core enzyme was reconstituted into a hybrid holoenzyme by the addition of E. coli sigma subunit. Both hybrid holoenzymes were, however, able to initiate transcription only from promoters which were recognized by both of the native holoenzymes.
TI  - Effects of high hydrostatic pressure on characteristics of pork slurries and inactivation of microorganisms associated with meat and meat products.
AB  - Pork slurries inoculated with various test microorganisms were prepared and subjected to high hydrostatic pressure at 1000 to 6000 atm for 10 min at 25 degrees C to examine for the pressure effects on characteristics of the slurries and the inactivation of the microorganisms associated with meat and meat products. Pressure treatment at higher than 3000 atm caused coagulation and discoloration of the pork slurries. Harder and more white coagulants were obtained by increasing the pressure. Pressure treatment at 3000 to 6000 atm killed all the microorganisms tested by more than 6-log colony-forming units (cfu)/g except Bacillus cereus spores. Gram-negative microorganisms were more labile to pressure than Gram-positive ones. Campylobacter jejuni, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium and Yersinia enterocolitica were inactivated at pressures higher than 3000 atm; Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida utilis at pressures higher than 4000 atm; Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis at 6000 atm. Only less than one-log cfu/g of B. cereus spores were inactivated at 6000 atm. Ultraviolet absorption spectra and acridine orange staining suggested that E. coli became permeable and leaked cytoplasmic RNA at lower pressure than S. aureus. From the present findings, the authors propose high hydrostatic pressure treatment as a promising means of preparing wholesome meat and meat products.
TI  - Influence of repeated lyophilization on the survival of Deinococcus proteolyticus, Micrococcus luteus and Escherichia coli.
AB  - Repeated lyophilization of Deinococcus proteolyticus, Micrococcus luteus and Escherichia coli cells results in a successive decrease of their survival. The survival curve is exponential with E. coli and M. luteus, and sigmoidal with a broad shoulder with D. proteolyticus both after repeated lyophilization and after UV- or gamma-irradiation. When cells were subjected to gamma-irradiation after a 20-fold freeze-drying, the corresponding survival curve became exponential without the shoulder. Hence we assume that irradiation and repeated lyophilization afflict the same cellular structures and/or functions.
TI  - Purification of equine neutrophil lysozyme and its antibacterial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Lysozyme from equine neutrophil granulocytes was isolated in a pure form by fast  performance liquid chromatography, i.e. ion-exchange chromatography and reversed-phase chromatography. The lysozyme lysed Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus lentus and was also bactericidal against the Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Bordetella bronchiseptica, and Serratia marcescens. Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis were not lysed. The lysozyme was only very slightly bactericidal for S. epidermidis and S. aureus. Equine neutrophil lysozyme was found to be bactericidal for Gram-positive as well as for Gram-negative bacteria without further treatment. Equine and chicken egg white lysozymes were found to be immunologically related when examined using specific antisera against each of them. Both lysozymes also had very similar specific enzymatic activities against M. luteus membranes.
TI  - Induction of immunity by latex beads and by hemolymph transfer in Galleria mellonella.
AB  - Injection of sterile latex beads into the hemocoel of last instar larvae of Galleria mellonella provoked a strong defense reaction. Cellular defense by hemocytes was followed by enhanced antibacterial activity in hemolymph. Latex-injected insects showed increased survival rates after a challenge injection with high doses of bacteria. Factors which stimulate the production of antibacterial activity could be demonstrated soon after injection by transfer of hemolymph from preinjected to untreated larvae. A large induction capacity in donor hemolymph was accompanied by a strong decrease in the total hemocyte count of free floating hemocytes, resulting from a decrease in number of plasmatocytes and granular cells, the cell types involved in the cellular defense against the injected latex beads. The results presented support the hypothesis that during cellular defense reactions, factors are released from the hemocytes which stimulate the production of antibacterial substances.
TI  - Enzymatic recognition of DNA modifications induced by singlet oxygen and photosensitizers.
AB  - DNA modifications induced either by photosensitization (illumination in the presence of methylene blue) or by chemically generated singlet oxygen (thermal decomposition of an 1,4-etheno-2,3-benzodioxin) are recognized and incised by repair endonucleases present in crude bacterial cell extracts. Only a small fraction of the incised modifications are sites of base loss (AP-sites) sensitive to exonuclease III, endonuclease IV from E. coli or to the UV-endonuclease from M. luteus. Cell extracts from E. coli strains overproducing or defective in endonuclease III recognize the modifications induced by illumination in the presence of methylene blue just as well as do those from wild-type E. coli strains. This indicates that dihydropyrimidine derivatives, which are characteristic of hydroxyl radical-induced DNA modifications, are absent. In contrast, most of the modifications induced are not recognized by a cell extract from a fpg strain defective in formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase FPG protein). Furthermore, incision by a cell extract from an E. coli strain overproducing FPG protein takes place at much lower protein concentration than with the wild-type strain. Experiments with purified FPG protein confirm that this enzyme is responsible for the recognition of singlet oxygen-induced DNA base modifications.
TI  - Antibacterial activity in the hemolymph of myriapods (Arthropoda).
AB  - The hemolymphs of two diplopod (Chicobolus sp. and Rhapidostreptus virgator) and  two chilopod species (Lithobius forficatus and Scolopendra cingulata) were tested for the presence of antibacterial substances using Petri dish tests. The native hemolymph of all species had substances acting on living Micrococcus luteus, whereas only Rhapidostreptus, Scolopendra, and Lithobius were effective against lyophilized Micrococcus. The antibacterial activity against living Micrococcus increased after inoculation with bacteria (Enterobacter cloacae beta-12) in Chicobolus and Rhapidostreptus and also against lyophilized Micrococcus in the latter. Thus, these effects appear to be inducible. None of the myriapods tested had any bacteriostatic effect on Escherichia coli D-31 whereas the growth of gram-negative E. cloacae was inhibited. The antibacterial substances in the diplopod species were unstable when heated but were resistant to freezing. At least two antibacterial substances (a lysozyme-like one and another substance) are considered to occur in Myriapoda.
TI  - Structure of the dnaA region of Micrococcus luteus: conservation and variations among eubacteria.
AB  - A phylogenetic tree constructed by 5S rRNA analysis is composed of three major branches in eubacteria: high G + C Gram+, low G + C Gram+ and Gram- [Hori and Osawa, Mol. Biol. Evol. 4 (1987) 445-472]. We have shown that the characteristic dnaA region is common among Escherichia coli (Gram-), Pseudomonas putida (Gram-), and Bacillus subtilis (low G + C Gram+). We have now determined the structure of the dnaA region of Micrococcus luteus, as a representative of the last branch, high G + C Gram+. The dnaA gene and at least three other genes, rnpA, rpmH and dnaN were found to be conserved in M. luteus. Large nontranslatable regions were found flanking the dnaA gene. The upstream region is conserved in the four bacteria so far examined. On the other hand, the downstream region is conserved only in Gram+ bacteria, M. luteus and B. subtilis. The consensus sequence of the DnaA box in M. luteus seems to be TTGTCCACA, in contrast to TTATCCACA of other bacteria. These results confirm our hypothesis that the dnaA region is the replication origin of the ancestral bacteria and that the essential feature of the DnaA protein and DnaA-box combination is conserved in eubacteria.
TI  - In vitro inhibition of bacterial DNA gyrase by cinodine, a glycocinnamoylspermidine antibiotic.
AB  - Cinodine, a broad-spectrum glycocinnamoylspermidine antibiotic, binds to DNA and  irreversibly inhibits bacterial and phase DNA synthesis. Cinodine was found to inhibit the activity of Micrococcus luteus DNA gyrase in vitro, but it did not inhibit the activities of two other DNA-binding enzymes, namely, topoisomerase I and BamHI. Although we cannot yet conclude that DNA gyrase is an intracellular target of the drug, in vitro inhibition of the enzyme by cinodine appears to be specific.
TI  - [Stability of Escherichia coli to the membranotropic antibiotic gramicidin S].
AB  - The work was aimed at studying the effect of gramicidin S on the intact cells, spheroplasts and membrane specimens of Escherichia coli K12S with the natural resistance to this antibiotic. The resistance was shown to be caused by the barrier properties of the cell wall: the spheroplasts were highly sensitive to the lytic action of gramicidin S. The differences in the sensitivity to gramicidin S of substrate oxidation carried by the membranes of E. coli and Micrococcus luteus, a sensitive organism, were not of crucial significance for the manifestation of the resistance. The resistance was not associated with the decrease of gramicidin S adsorption: the cells were capable of binding large quantities of the antibiotic and remaining viable. Gramicidin S appeared to be attached to the cell walls (most likely, the outer membranes) rather than the cytoplasmic membranes.
TI  - Role of GC-biased mutation pressure on synonymous codon choice in Micrococcus luteus, a bacterium with a high genomic GC-content.
AB  - The GC (G + C, or G or C)-contents of codon silent positions in all two-codon sets and three codons AUY/A (IIe), and in most of the family boxes of Micrococcus luteus (genomic GC-content: 74%) are 95% to 100% in both the highly and weakly expressed genes. In some family boxes, there is a decrease in NNC codons and an increase in NNG codons from the highly expressed to weakly expressed genes without apparent involvement of NNU and NNA codons. From these observations, we conclude that the selective use of synonymous codons in M. luteus may be largely determined by GC-biased mutation pressure and that in the highly expressed genes tRNAs would act as a weak selection pressure in some family boxes. Available data suggest that the effect of selection pressure by tRNAs on the synonymous codon choice becomes more apparent in the highly expressed genes in eubacteria with intermediate GC-contents such as Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis, and that the U/C ratio of the codon third positions in NNU/C-type two-codon sets in the weakly expressed genes would represent the approximate magnitude of directional mutation pressure throughout eubacteria.
TI  - Superhelical stress restrained in plasmid DNA during repair synthesis initiated by the UvrA, B and C proteins in vitro.
AB  - Purified UvrA, UvrB, UvrC, UvrD, PolA and Lig proteins from Escherichia coli have been used to assess the effect of nucleotide excision repair on the conformation of native negatively supercoiled plasmid DNA in an in vitro test system. The analysis of labeled reaction products on specific gel systems suggests that the Uvr excinuclease has the ability to restrain the superhelical stress in the template DNA during the repair process. This feature, observed in the case of the Uvr system is not found if the repair reaction is initiated by T4 endonuclease V or Micrococcus luteus UV endonuclease.
TI  - Spectinomycin operon of Micrococcus luteus: evolutionary implications of organization and novel codon usage.
AB  - The complete DNA sequence of the Micrococcus luteus spectinomycin (spc) operon and its adjacent regions has been determined. The sequence has revealed the presence of genes that are homologous to those of the Escherichia coli ribosomal and related proteins, L14, L24, L5, S8, L6, L18, S5, L30, L15, and secretion protein Y (sec Y), and the gene for adenylate kinase (adk). The gene arrangement in the spc operon is essentially the same as that of E. coli except for the absence in the M. luteus spc operon of the genes for S14 and X protein that exist in the E. coli spc operon. SecY and adk seem to be composed of another operon (adk operon) with at least an open reading frame. The deduced amino acid sequences for these ribosomal proteins are well conserved among the two species (40-65% identity). Reflecting the high genomic guanine and cytosine (GC) content of M. luteus (74%), the codon usage of the genes is extremely biased toward use of G and C, about 94% of the codon third positions being G or C. Seven codons, AUA, AAA, AGA, UUA, GUA, CUA, and CAA, all of which have A at the codon third positions, are completely absent in the M. luteus genes examined. Out of 11 genes in the M. luteus spc and adk operons, 5 (10) use GUG (UGA) and 6 (1) use AUG (UAA) as an initiation (termination) codon.
TI  - Template-primer activity of 5-(hydroxymethyl)uracil-containing DNA for prokaryotic and eukaryotic DNA and RNA polymerases.
AB  - We have utilized Bacillus subtilis phage SPO-1 DNA as a model of irradiated DNA.  In this phage, all thymine (Thy) residues are replaced by 5-(hydroxymethyl)uracil (5HmUra), which is a known irradiation-induced derivative of DNA Thy. SPO-1 phage is naturally devoid of other such irradiation-induced DNA lesions. DNase I activated SPO-1 phage DNA served as well as, or even better than, the control DNAs (Bacillus subtilis DNA and calf thymus DNA) as a template-primer for Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, and human HL-60 cell DNA polymerases. Furthermore, the template activity of SPO-1 phage DNA was also superior when transcription with E. coli RNA polymerase was investigated. The results reported here indicated that the replacement of Thy by 5HmUra is not deleterious to template and primer functions during DNA or RNA synthesis.
TI  - Micrococcus luteus, a bacterium with a high genomic G + C content, contains Escherichia coli-type promoters.
AB  - The G + C content of Micrococcus luteus DNA is 74%, which is much higher than that of Escherichia coli (about 50%). In order to understand the influence of GC-directed mutation pressure (GC pressure) on the promoter structure, the initiation sites for both in vitro and in vivo transcription of M. luteus streptomycin (str) and spectinomycin (spc) operons were identified by the reverse transcriptase mapping method. The promoter sequences of M. luteus are similar to those of E. coli, but have significantly higher G + C contents. In an in vitro run-off transcription assay using truncated DNA templates, RNA polymerases from both M. luteus and E. coli were able to transcribe correctly from both the str promoter and the spc major promoter of M. luteus.
TI  - Protozoan Response to the Addition of Bacterial Predators and Other Bacteria to Soil.
AB  - Representatives of several categories of bacteria were added to soil to determine which of them might elicit responses from the soil protozoa. The various categories were nonobligate bacterial predators of bacteria, prey bacteria for these predators, indigenous bacteria that are normally present in high numbers in soil, and non-native bacteria that often find their way in large numbers into soil. The soil was incubated and the responses of the indigenous protozoa were determined by most-probable-number estimations of total numbers of protozoa. Although each soil was incubated with only one species of added bacteria, the protozoan response for the soil was evaluated by using most-probable-number estimations of several species of bacteria. The protozoa did not respond to incubation of the soil with either Cupriavidus necator, a potent bacterial predator, or one of its prey species, Micrococcus luteus. C. necator also had no effect on the protozoa. Therefore, in this case, bacterial and protozoan predators did not interact, except for possible competition for bacterial prey cells. The soil protozoa did not respond to the addition of Arthrobacter globiformis or Bacillus thuringiensis. Therefore, the autochthonous state of Arthrobacter species in soil and the survival of B. thuringiensis were possibly enhanced by the resistance of these species to protozoa. The addition of Bacillus mycoides and Escherichia coli cells caused specific responses by soil protozoa. The protozoa that responded to E. coli did not respond to B. mycoides or any other bacteria, and vice versa. Therefore, addition to soil of a nonsoil bacterium, such as E. coli, did not cause a general increase in numbers of protozoa or in protozoan control of the activities of other bacteria in the soil.
TI  - Inhibition of bacterial isoprenoid synthesis by fosmidomycin, a phosphonic acid-containing antibiotic.
AB  - The mechanism of action of fosmidomycin (FR-31564), a phosphonic acid containing  antibiotic, was examined against Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus and other bacteria. It converted growing Esch. coli cells into spheroplasts or swollen cells, but did not inhibit the enzymatic reactions of cell wall synthesis in ether-treated cells. Unlike bicyclomycin, phenethyl alcohol and mitomycin C, it did not reduce the amount of envelope lipoprotein, phospholipids, or DNA, but did reduce the amount of menaquinones and ubiquinones in growing Esch. coli cells. It also inhibited the biosynthesis of both carotenoids and menaquinones in M. luteus cells, suggesting that inhibition of the biosynthesis of a common precursor of these isoprenoids (possibly farnesyl pyrophosphate) might be the main site of its antibacterial activity.
TI  - Effect of exposure of Pieris brassicae larvae to 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid on the natural antibacterial activity of serum.
AB  - Larvae of the cabbage white butterfly, Pieris brassicae, were reared on a semisynthetic diet with or without 20 ppm of the herbicide 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T) and using three assays the sera were subsequently tested for natural antibacterial activity against Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli K12, and Micrococcus luteus. These assays showed that exposure of larvae to 2,4,5-T lowered the antibacterial activity of the serum against E. coli and M. luteus compared with control animals. Spectrophotometric tests for the presence of a lysozyme-like principle in the serum also revealed similar trends with a significant loss of enzyme activity in 2,4,5-T-treated insects. Overall total serum protein levels of control and 2,4,5-T-treated insects were similar, suggesting a specific effect of the herbicide on certain serum components such as lysozyme. The possible mode of action of the herbicide on production of antibacterial factors is discussed.
TI  - Micrococcus luteus homolog of the Escherichia coli uvrA gene: identification of a mutation in the UV-sensitive mutant DB7.
AB  - Restriction fragments of Micrococcus luteus DNA containing the gene affected by a mutation in the UV-sensitive mutant DB7 were cloned both from the wild type and from the mutant in an Escherichia coli host-vector system. The wild-type fragment was able to reverse the multiple sensitivity of the mutant to UV, mitomycin C, and 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide by a one-step transformation. Determination of the nucleotide sequences revealed a potential open reading frame coding for a protein of 992 (tentative) amino acid residues, within which the DB7 mutation was identified as a CG-to-TA transition causing a translation termination. The putative product of the open reading frame shares an extensive amino acid sequence homology with the E. coli UvrA protein comprising 940 residues. The homology extends over the greater part of both polypeptides except for two extra sequences of 31 and 24 amino acid residues located at the amino-terminal and in the interior, respectively, of the M. luteus protein. In the homologous region, 56.7% and 16.7% of the 933 pairs of the aligned amino acids were accounted for by conserved residues and conservative substitutions, respectively. These results indicate that the gene defined by the mutation in DB7 represents a homolog of the E. coli uvrA gene. Hence, it has to be concluded that DB7, known for its deficiency in UV endonuclease (pyrimidine dimer DNA glycosylase/apurinicapyrimidinic endonuclease) activity, is a double mutant which is also defective in an enzyme complex similar to the E. coli UvrABC excinuclease.
TI  - Rolling-circle replication of UV-irradiated duplex DNA in the phi X174 replicative-form----single-strand replication system in vitro.
AB  - Cloning of the phi X174 viral origin of replication into phage M13mp8 produced an M13-phi X174 chimera, the DNA of which directed efficient replicative-form----single-strand rolling-circle replication in vitro. This replication assay was performed with purified phi X174-encoded gene A protein, Escherichia coli rep helicase, single-stranded DNA-binding protein, and DNA polymerase III holoenzyme. The nicking of replicative-form I (RFI) DNA by gene A protein was essentially unaffected by the presence of UV lesions in the DNA. However, unwinding of UV-irradiated DNA by the rep helicase was inhibited twofold as compared with unwinding of the unirradiated substrate. UV irradiation of the substrate DNA caused a strong inhibition in its ability to direct DNA synthesis. However, even DNA preparations that contained as many as 10 photodimers per molecule still supported the synthesis of progeny full-length single-stranded DNA. The appearance of full-length radiolabeled products implied at least two full rounds of replication, since the first round released the unlabeled plus viral strand of the duplex DNA. Pretreatment of the UV-irradiated DNA substrate with purified pyrimidine dimer endonuclease from Micrococcus luteus, which converted photodimer-containing supercoiled RFI DNA into relaxed, nicked RFII DNA and thus prevented its replication, reduced DNA synthesis by 70%. Analysis of radiolabeled replication products by agarose gel electrophoresis followed by autoradiography revealed that this decrease was due to a reduction in the synthesis of progeny full-length single-stranded DNA. This implies that 70 to 80% of the full-length DNA products produced in this system were synthesized on molecules that carried photodimers. Thus, similarly to its activity on UV-irradiated single-stranded DNA, DNA polymerase III holenzyme can bypass pyrimidine photodimers in the more complex replicative form --->single-strand replication, which involves, in addition to the polymerizing activity, the unwinding of the duplex by the rep helicase and the participation of a more complex multiprotein replisome.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of cervical mucus in pregnant or non-pregnant women].
AB  - Antibacterial activities of human cervical mucus obtained from non-pregnant and pregnant women were tested using standard blood agar plates. The combined effect of cervical mucus with cefmetazole (CMZ) was also investigated. Obtained results are summarized as follows. 1. Cervical mucus specimens obtained from 6 subjects at 9 to 36 weeks of pregnancy showed antibacterial activity to only one strain of Bacillus subtilis among organisms tested. The cervical mucus enhanced the activity of CMZ against 1 strain of Streptococcus pyogenes and 2 strains of Micrococcus luteus, but no effect was observed against other organisms tested. 2. Cervical mucus specimens obtained from non-pregnant women showed antibacterial activities to 8 of 11 strains (72.7%) of B. subtilis tested. The cervical mucus enhanced the activities of CMZ against 1 strain of S. pyogenes and 3 strains of B. subtilis. The tested organisms included Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Bacteroides fragilis, S. pyogenes, B. subtilis, M. luteus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis, and Candida albicans, but, as described above, cervical mucus samples showed antimicrobial activities only against B. subtilis (9/17, 52.9%), and specimens obtained only from non-pregnant women or pregnant women with less than 11 weeks of pregnancy showed any antimicrobial activities.
TI  - Excision-repair capacity of UV-irradiated strains of Escherichia coli and Streptococcus pneumoniae, estimated by plasmid recovery.
AB  - Although the biological role of many bacterial repair genes is known, there is still an interest in evaluating the capacity of repair pyrimidine dimers in some strains. For this purpose, we have developed a rapid assay. Cells bearing a plasmid are UV irradiated and incubated to allow recovery. The plasmid DNA is extracted, purified and treated with UV endonuclease from Micrococcus luteus that specifically produces single strand breaks at the site of pyrimidine dimers. The amount of open circular and covalently closed circular forms of the plasmid DNA after treatment and post-incubation provides an estimate of the repair capability of the host strain. The wild type strain and the uvrA mutant of Escherichia coli were used to adjust the assay. The lexA mutant of E. coli has been tested and its repair capability is equivalent to that of wild-type strain. The assay has been extended to Streptococcus pneumoniae, which is naturally deficient in photoreactivation and SOS-like functions. This strain is efficient in the repair of pyrimidine dimers, formed after UV irradiation.
TI  - Factor C from rabbit liver. A new poly(dC) and poly[d(G-C)] template-selective stimulatory protein of DNA polymerases.
AB  - We have undertaken a search for mammalian DNA-binding proteins that enhance the activity of DNA polymerases in a template sequence-specific fashion. In this paper, we report the extensive purification and characterization of a new DNA-binding protein from rabbit liver that selectively stimulates DNA polymerases to copy synthetic poly[d(G-C)] and the poly(dC) strand of poly(dC).poly(dG) as well as single-stranded natural DNA that contains stretches of oligo(dC). The enhancing protein, a polypeptide of 65 kDa designated factor C, stimulates the copying of the two synthetic templates by Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I, Micrococcus luteus polymerase, and eukaryotic DNA polymerases alpha and beta, but not by avian myeloblastosis virus polymerase. Factor C, however, does not affect utilization by these polymerases of the poly(dG) strand of poly(dC).poly(dG), of poly(dC) primed by oligo(dG), or of poly(dA).poly(dT) and poly[d(A-T)]. With polymerase I, Michaelis constants (Km) of poly[d(G-C)] and of the poly(dC) strand of poly(dC).poly(dG) are decreased by factor C 37- and 4.7-fold, respectively, whereas maximum velocity (Vmax) remains unchanged. By contrast, neither the Km value of the poly(dG) strand of poly(dC).poly(dG) nor the Vmax value with this template is altered by factor C. Rates of copying of activated DNA, denatured DNA, or singly primed M13 DNA are not affected significantly by factor C. However, primer extension analysis of the copying of recombinant M13N4 DNA that contains runs of oligo(dC) within an inserted thymidine kinase gene shows that factor C increases processivity by specifically augmenting the efficiency at which polymerase I traverses the oligo(dC) stretches. Direct binding of factor C to denatured DNA is indicated by retention of the protein-DNA complex on columns of DEAE-cellulose. Binding of factor C to poly[d(G-C)] is demonstrated by the specific adsorption of the enhancing protein to columns of poly[d(G-C)]-Sepharose. We propose that by binding to poly[d(G-C)] and to poly(dC).poly(dG), factor C enables tighter binding of some DNA polymerases to these templates and facilitates enzymatic activity.
TI  - Comparison of phage T4 denV endonuclease V and M. luteus UV-DNA endonuclease by serology and DNA hybridization.
AB  
TI  - Extracellular product of Nocardia amarae induces bacterial cell flocculation.
AB  - The fact that Nocardia amarae YK1 produced a bacterial flocculation-inducing substance (designated as FIX) was discovered. FIX had a function of flocculating proliferous cells. FIX-induced flocculation was inhibited by making cells resting, but not completely by adding chloramphenicol. FIX worked widely on Gram-positive to -negative bacteria. In the presence of FIX, Achromobacter cycloclastus IAM1013, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus IAM1517, Bacillus subtilis IAM1069, Escherichia coli C600-1, E. coli IAM1239, Flavobacterium lutescens IAM1667, Klebsiella pneumoniae IAM1102, Micrococcus luteus IAM1313 and Pseudomonas putida IAM1002 formed flocs. B. cereus IAM1029, however, exhibited no flocculation.
TI  - Proximity of repair patches to persistent pyrimidine dimers in DNA of normal human and xeroderma pigmentosum cells.
AB  - The proximity of repair patches to persistent pyrimidine dimers in normal human cells and xeroderma pigmentosum group C and D cells was analyzed by sequential digestion of repaired DNA with Micrococcus luteus UV-endonuclease and Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I. Although this enzymatic digestion removed one-third of the pyrimidine dimers, less than 3% of the label associated with repair patches and a similar amount of uniformly labeled DNA were removed. The repair patches therefore appear to be similarly distant from persistent dimers in all cell types, and, in particular, are not adjacent to unexcised dimers in xeroderma pigmentosum group D cells. A previous model that suggested that patches are inserted adjacent to dimers in xeroderma pigmentosum group D cells receives no support from these results.
TI  - Evidence for a Micrococcus luteus gene homologous to uvrB of Escherichia coli.
AB  - Restriction fragments of Micrococcus luteus DNA that contained the gene defined by the mutation of an excision repair-deficient mutant, UVsN1, were cloned from both the parental and mutant strains with the Escherichia coli host-vector system. The wild-type fragment was able to reverse the multiple sensitivity of the mutant to ultraviolet, mitomycin C, and 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide by one-step transformation. Determination of the nucleotide sequences revealed an open reading frame potentially coding for a protein of 709 amino acid residues, within which the mutation was identified as a CG----TA transition causing a change from serine to phenylalanine. The putative product of the open reading frame showed an extensive amino acid sequence homology to the E. coli UvrB protein comprising 673 residues; the homologous region extended over the greater parts of both polypeptides, in which 55% and 17% of the 659 pairs of aligned amino acids were accounted for by conserved residues and conservative substitutions, respectively. This indicates that the gene defined by the UVsN1 mutation represents a homolog of the E. coli uvrB gene, implying the presence in M. luteus of an enzyme complex homologous to the E. coli UvrABC excinuclease.
TI  - Directional mutation pressure and transfer RNA in choice of the third nucleotide  of synonymous two-codon sets.
AB  - Bacterial species have diverged into a series of families, some with high G + C content in their DNA, and other with high A + T content, resulting, respectively, from G.C- and A.T-directional mutation pressures. Such mutation pressure (G.C/A.T pressure) may be an important determinant for codon usage. It has also been suggested that tRNA acts as a selective constraint for determining codon usage. We have studied the relation between G.C/A.T pressure and tRNA constraints in determining choice of the third nucleotide of eight two-codon sets, using codon usage data obtained from protein genes in four bacterial species, Mycoplasma capricolum, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, and Micrococcus luteus, and in liverwort (Marchantia polymorpha) chloroplasts. The genomic G + C contents of these range from 25% to 74%. The results demonstrate that tRNA levels act additively to A.T and G.C pressure in affecting contents of A (pairing with *UNN anticodons, in which *U indicates a 2-thiouridine derivative) and C (pairing with GNN anticodons) or G (pairing with CNN anticodons), respectively, in third nucleotide positions of codons.
TI  - Purification of Citrobacter freundii DNA gyrase and inhibition by quinolones.
AB  - DNA gyrase is a bacterial enzyme which catalyzes the ATP-dependent negative supercoiling of DNA. It is the accepted target of quinolones. The enzyme from Citrobacter freundii IID976 was purified by affinity chromatography on novobiocin-Sepharose and heparin-Sepharose. It had two subunits, designated A and B, which closely resembled those of the enzyme from Escherichia coli and Micrococcus luteus in enzymatic requirements. The inhibitory effects of the quinolones on the supercoiling activities of the enzyme correlated with their antibacterial activities. New quinolones were better inhibitors of DNA gyrase than nalidixic acid and pipemidic acid. We also purified DNA gyrase from a spontaneous nalidixic acid-resistant mutant (M2-5). The gyrases from IID976 and M2-5 were defined as mixtures of subunits As+Bs (s, susceptible) and Ar+Br (r, resistant), respectively. The supercoiling activities of reconstituted Ar+Br and Ar+Bs were more resistant to quinolones than As+Bs and As+Br. These findings indicate that one mechanism of C. freundii resistance against quinolones is resistance modification of the A subunit protein.
TI  - Mechanism of action of Micrococcus luteus gamma-endonuclease.
AB  - Micrococcus luteus extracts contain gamma-endonuclease, a Mg2+-independent endonuclease that cleaves gamma-irradiated DNA. This enzyme has been purified approximately 1000-fold, and the purified enzyme was used to study its substrate specificity and mechanism of action. gamma-Endonuclease cleaves DNA containing either thymine glycols, urea residues, or apurinic sites but not undamaged DNA or DNA containing reduced apurinic sites. The enzyme has both N-glycosylase activity that releases thymine glycol residues from OsO4-treated DNA and an associated apurinic endonuclease activity. The location and nature of the cleavage site produced has been determined with DNA sequencing techniques. gamma-Endonuclease cleaves DNA containing thymine glycols or apurinic sites immediately 3' to the damaged or missing base. Cleavage results in a 5'-phosphate terminus and a 3' baseless sugar residue. Cleavage sites can be converted to primers for DNA polymerase I by subsequent treatment with Escherichia coli exonuclease III. The mechanism of action of gamma-endonuclease and its substrate specificity are very similar to those identified for E. coli endonuclease III.
TI  - Organization and codon usage of the streptomycin operon in Micrococcus luteus, a  bacterium with a high genomic G + C content.
AB  - The DNA sequence of the Micrococcus luteus str operon, which includes genes for ribosomal proteins S12 (str or rpsL) and S7 (rpsG) and elongation factors (EF) G (fus) and Tu (tuf), has been determined and compared with the corresponding sequence of Escherichia coli to estimate the effect of high genomic G + C content (74%) of M. luteus on the codon usage pattern. The gene organization in this operon and the deduced amino acid sequence of each corresponding protein are well conserved between the two species. The mean G + C content of the M. luteus str operon is 67%, which is much higher than that of E. coli (51%). The codon usage pattern of M. luteus is very different from that of E. coli and extremely biased to the use of G and C in silent positions. About 95% (1,309 of 1,382) of codons have G or C at the third position. Codon GUG is used for initiation of S12, EF-G, and EF-Tu, and AUG is used only in S7, whereas GUG initiates only one of the EF-Tu's in E. coli. UGA is the predominant termination codon in M. luteus, in contrast to UAA in E. coli.
TI  - DNA polymerase A and its stimulative factor of baker's yeast: purification and characterization.
AB  - DNA polymerase A (I or major) and its stimulative factor were purified from 15-20 kg wet weight of baker's yeast by several procedures, which were varied in order to examine the possible occurrence of proteolysis. The extraction was carried out in the presence of 10 or 3 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), followed by either batchwise adsorption-elution or column chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose (rapid or time-consuming, respectively). These early steps were followed by column chromatographies on DEAE-, CM-, and heparin-Sepharoses, phosphocellulose, and Sephacryl S-300. Preparations of the polymerase obtained by all the procedures described above showed a single protein band at Mr of about 145,000 in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), unless they had been treated with 2-mercaptoethanol (ME). After ME treatment, however, they showed two protein bands at Mr of about 145,000 and 75,000 in SDS-PAGE, except for those obtained by the procedure involving 10 mM PMSF and the batchwise adsorption-elution. All the preparations described above showed practically the same specific activity. This indicates that in intact cells, the polymerase consisted of a single peptide with Mr of about 145,000, and that after cell disruption, it was artificially hydrolyzed in a limited fashion into two peptides with Mr of about 75,000, which were still active and were linked to each other through a disulfide bond. Preparations of the factor obtained by all the procedures described above showed a single protein band at Mr of about 20,000 in SDS-PAGE before and after ME treatment. The relative activities of the purified polymerase were (100%), 123, 21, 37, 196, and 38% with native and denatured salmon sperm DNA, native and denatured calf thymus DNA, poly(dA-dT), and poly(dA).oligo(dT)10, respectively. With the addition of the purified factor, they were 173, 272, 173, 217, 173, and 247%, respectively, i.e., significantly stimulated. The purified factor also stimulated the activity of calf thymus DNA polymerase alpha by 150% with denatured salmon sperm DNA; Km was about 5 X 10(-10)M, practically the same as that of yeast DNA polymerase A. However, it hardly influenced the activities of Escherichia coli enzyme I or Micrococcus luteus enzyme.
TI  - Structural and immunochemical characterization of a ribosomal protein from gram-positive Micrococcus luteus which is functionally homologous to Escherichia coli ribosomal protein S1.
AB  - Ribosomes from gram-positive Micrococcus luteus contain an acidic protein (ML-S1). ML-S1 has been purified by chromatography of ribosomes on a poly(U)-Sepharose column and the purified protein has a mobility in sodium dodecyl sulphate/polyacrylamide gels similar to that of ribosomal protein S1 of Escherichia coli (apparent Mr 72,000). Protein ML-S1 reacted with E. coli anti-S1 serum with an immunological partial-identity reaction. ML-S1 also reacted with antibodies raised against two structural domains of E. coli S1 (the N-terminal ribosome-binding domain and central and C-terminal nucleic-acid-binding domain). Weak reaction with antiserum to the nucleic-acid-binding domain of E. coli S1 was observed. ML-S1 was digested with trypsin under mild and exhaustive conditions. Mild digestion resulted in the production of a trypsin-resistant core (ML-S1F1) like E. coli S1. The fragment pattern obtained after exhaustive digestion differed appreciably from that obtained with E. coli S1. ML-S1 bound to poly(U) as strongly as E. coli S1 and also showed appreciable binding to denatured DNA. Addition of ML-S1 to S1-depleted ribosomes from E. coli and M. luteus markedly stimulated the poly(U)-directed polyphenylalanine synthesis. Phage MS2-RNA-dependent translation was also found to be stimulated by ML-S1 although to a much lesser extent than the stimulation by E. coli S1. At a molar excess of ML-S1 to ribosomes the protein showed a similar inhibitory effect to E. coli S1 on polypeptide synthesis. Our data indicate that ML-S1 retained the structural domains important for its function despite certain structural differences from E. coli S1.
TI  - Selective inhibition by methoxyamine of the apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease activity associated with pyrimidine dimer-DNA glycosylases from Micrococcus luteus and bacteriophage T4.
AB  - The UV endonucleases [endodeoxyribonuclease (pyrimidine dimer), EC 3.1.25.1] from Micrococcus luteus and bacteriophage T4 possess two catalytic activities specific for the site of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers in UV-irradiated DNA: a DNA glycosylase that cleaves the 5'-glycosyl bond of the dimerized pyrimidines and an apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) endonuclease that thereupon incises the phosphodiester bond 3' to the resulting apyrimidinic site. We have explored the potential use of methoxyamine, a chemical that reacts at neutral pH with AP sites in DNA, as a selective inhibitor of the AP endonuclease activities residing in the M. luteus and T4 enzymes. The presence of 50 mM methoxyamine during incubation of UV- (4 kJ/m2, 254 nm) treated, [3H]thymine-labeled poly(dA).poly(dT) with either enzyme preparation was found to protect completely the irradiated copolymer from endonucleolytic attack at dimer sites, as assayed by yield of acid-soluble radioactivity. In contrast, the dimer-DNA glycosylase activity of each enzyme remained fully functional, as monitored retrospectively by release of free thymine after either photochemical- (5 kJ/m2, 254 nm) or photoenzymic- (Escherichia coli photolyase plus visible light) induced reversal of pyrimidine dimers in the UV-damaged substrate. Our data demonstrate that the inhibition of the strand-incision reaction arises because of chemical modification of the AP sites and is not due to inactivation of the enzyme by methoxyamine. Our results, combined with earlier findings for 5'-acting AP endonucleases, strongly suggest that methoxyamine is a highly specific inhibitor of virtually all AP endonucleases, irrespective of their modes of action, and may therefore prove useful in a wide variety of DNA repair studies.
TI  - Pyrimidine homoribonucleosides: synthesis, solution conformation, and some biological properties.
AB  - Conversion of uridine and cytidine to their 5'-O-tosyl derivatives, followed by cyanation with tetraethylammonium cyanide, reduction and deamination, led to isolation of the hitherto unknown homouridine (1-(5'-deoxy-beta-D-allofuranosyl)uracil) and homocytidine (1-(5'-deoxy-beta-D-allofuranosyl)cytosine), analogues of uridine and cytidine in which the exocyclic 5'-CH2OH chain is extended by one carbon to CH2CH2OH. Homocytidine was also phosphorylated to its 6'-phosphate and 6'-pyrophosphate analogues. In addition, it was converted, via its 2,2'-anhydro derivative, to arahomocytidine, an analogue of the chemotherapeutically active araC. The structures of all the foregoing were established by various criteria, including 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy, both of which were also applied to analyses of the solution conformations of the various compounds, particularly as regards the conformations of the exocyclic chains. The behaviour of the homo analogues was examined in several enzymatic systems. Homocytidine was a feeble substrate, without inhibitory properties, of E. coli cytidine deaminase. Homocytidine was an excellent substrate for wheat shoot nucleoside phosphotransferase; while homouridine was a good substrate for E. coli uridine phosphorylase. Although homoCMP was neither a substrate, nor an inhibitor, of snake venom 5'-nucleotidase, homoCDP was a potent inhibitor of this enzyme (Ki approximately 6 microM). HomoCDP was not a substrate for M. luteus polynucleotide phosphorylase. None of the compounds exhibited significant activity vs herpes simplex virus type 1, or cytotoxic activity in several mammalian cell lines.
TI  - Production of pyrimidine dimers in DNA of human skin exposed in situ to UVA radiation.
AB  - Cyclobutyl pyrimidine dimers, measured as sites recognized by the dimer-specific  ultraviolet (UV) endonuclease from Micrococcus luteus, were produced in DNA of human skin exposed in situ to UVA (320-400 nm) radiation. The dimer yields produced by a broadband UVA source, by broadband UVA filtered to remove all light of wavelength less than 340 nm, and by narrow band radiation centered at 365 nm were similar, indicating that UVA radiation, and not stray shorter wavelength radiation, was responsible for dimer production. The identity of the UVA-induced DNA lesions was confirmed as pyrimidine dimers by photoreactivation of approximately 100% of the endonuclease-sensitive sites in vitro with the 40,000 dalton Escherichia coli photoreactivating enzyme.
TI  - Inhibition of DNA gyrase by optically active ofloxacin.
AB  - Inhibition of DNA gyrase activity by optically active ofloxacins was studied and  compared with the inhibition of norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin. The (-)-isomer of ofloxacin inhibited the supercoiling activity of gyrase from Micrococcus luteus more effectively than did the (+)-isomer. The 50% inhibitory concentrations of (-)-, (+/-)-, and (+)-ofloxacin; norfloxacin; and ciprofloxacin for gyrase from Escherichia coli were 0.78, 0.98, 7.24, 0.78, and 1.15 microgram/ml, respectively. These values correlated well with the antibacterial activity of each compound against intact bacterial cells.
TI  - Site-specific gap-misrepair mutagenesis by O4-ethylthymine.
AB  - The mutagenicity of the DNA base O-alkylation adduct, O4-ethylthymine, specifically incorporated into the plasmid vector pUC8 at the unique SalI and HincII recognition sites, was studied in vivo. Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus and AMV DNA polymerases catalyze the incorporation of O4-ethylTMP against template adenine and guanine residues, resulting in DNA sequence alteration during subsequent replication in the host E. coli K-12 strain JM83. The greatest mutation frequency was observed with error-prone AMV DNA polymerase. High levels of cognate restriction endonuclease-resistant mutant plasmid isolates were obtained by gap replication repair in the presence of O4-ethylTTP. The yields of mutant isolates were dependent upon the relative concentration of the competing pyrimidine deoxynucleoside triphosphates, TTP and dCTP, in the misreplication reaction. Repair of incorporated O4-ethylTMP of plasmid DNA by in vitro treatment with specific alkyltransferase, prior to transformation in the host, effectively increases the mutagenic efficiency of the adduct. The results obtained are consistent with the high miscoding potential O4-ethylthymine observed in in vitro studies and its ability to base-pair with noncomplementary guanine residues in DNA.
TI  - Repair of UV-irradiated plasmid DNA in mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Escherichia coli deficient in repair of pyrimidine dimers.
AB  - The repair of in vitro UV-irradiated DNA of plasmid pBB29 was studied in excision defective yeast mutants rad1, rad2, rad3, rad4, rad10 and in Escherichia coli mutants uvr- and recA-, by measuring the cell transformation frequency. Rad2, rad3, rad4, and rad10 mutants could repair plasmid DNA despite their inability to repair nuclear DNA, whereas the reduced ability of rad1 mutant for plasmid DNA repair demonstrated alone the same dependence on the host functions that are needed for nuclear DNA repair. In E. coli the repair of UV-irradiated plasmid DNA is carried out only by the excision-repair system dependent on uvr genes. Treatment of UV-irradiated plasmid DNA with UV endonuclease from Micrococcus luteus greatly enhances the efficiency of transformation of E. coli uvr- mutants. Similar treatment with cell-free extracts of yeast rad1 mutant or wild-type strains as well as with nuclease BaL31, despite their ability for preferential cutting of UV damaged DNA, showed no influence on cell transformation.
TI  - Characterization of genes and proteins involved in excision repair of human cells.
AB  - To extend our knowledge of the excision repair system in mammalian cells we have  focussed on the isolation of genes and proteins involved in this process. For the purification and characterization of human repair proteins the microneedle injection assay technique is utilized. This system is based on the transient correction of the excision repair defect of xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) fibroblasts (scored as increase of ultraviolet (u.v.)-induced unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) upon microinjection of crude extracts from complementing XP or normal cells. Specific correction is observed in fibroblasts of all (9) excision-deficient XP complementation groups. The XP-A and G correcting factors were found to be proteins and several purification steps (including (NH4)2SO4 fractionation, chromatography of phosphocellulose, heparin and u.v.-irradiated DNA-cellulose) have been worked out for the XP-A correcting protein. The microinjection system was also used for the introduction of (partially) purified repair enzymes of lower organisms. Micrococcus luteus endonuclease and bacteriophage T4 endonuclease V were able to correct all XP complementation groups tested, in marked contrast to the more sophisticated Escherichia coli uvrABC complex injected with uvrD. Photoreversal of dimers could be registered after introduction of the yeast photoreactivating enzyme in repair-competent, XP-variant, XP-C and XP-I fibroblasts (monitored as decrease of (residual) UDS). Remarkably, no effect was noticed in XP-A, D, E and H, suggesting that something prevents dimers in these cells from being monomerized by the injected enzyme. Using DNA-mediated gene transfer we have cloned a human gene (designated ERCC-1) that compensates for the excision defect of the u.v. and mitomycin C-sensitive Chinese hamster ovary cell (CHO) mutant 43-3B (complementation group 2). Characterization of this gene and its cDNA revealed the following features: (1) ERCC-1 corrects the full spectrum of repair deficiencies in mutants of complementation group 2. No correction is observed in mutants of the other CHO complementation groups. (2) The ERCC-1 gene has a size of 15 X 10(3) base-pairs (bp) and consists of 10 exons, one of which appears to be differentially spliced. (3) It encodes two largely identical mRNAs, which differ in the presence or absence of a 72 bp coding exon, situated in the 3' half of the mRNA. Only the cDNA of the large transcript is able to confer repair proficiency to 43-3B cells. No effect of u.v. treatment is found at the level of ERCC-1 transcription in HeLa cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Analysis of cell division gene ftsZ (sulB) from gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The ftsZ (sulB) gene of Escherichia coli codes for a 40,000-dalton protein that carries out a key step in the cell division pathway. The presence of an ftsZ gene protein in other bacterial species was examined by a combination of Southern blot and Western blot analyses. Southern blot analysis of genomic restriction digests revealed that many bacteria, including species from six members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and from Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Agrobacterium tumefaciens, contained sequences which hybridized with an E. coli ftsZ probe. Genomic DNA from more distantly related bacteria, including Bacillus subtilis, Branhamella catarrhalis, Micrococcus luteus, and Staphylococcus aureus, did not hybridize under minimally stringent conditions. Western blot analysis, with anti-E. coli FtsZ antiserum, revealed that all bacterial species examined contained a major immunoreactive band. Several of the Enterobacteriaceae were transformed with a multicopy plasmid encoding the E. coli ftsZ gene. These transformed strains, Shigella sonnei, Salmonella typhimurium, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterobacter aerogenes, were shown to overproduce the FtsZ protein and to produce minicells. Analysis of [35S]methionine-labeled minicells revealed that the plasmid-encoded gene products were the major labeled species. This demonstrated that the E. coli ftsZ gene could function in other bacterial species to induce minicells and that these minicells could be used to analyze plasmid-endoced gene products.
TI  - Direct evaluation of phenylacetyl-CoA: 6-aminopenicillanic acid acyltransferase of Penicillium chrysogenum by bioassay.
AB  - The enzyme phenylacetyl-CoA: 6-Aminopenicillanic acid acyltransferase of Penicillium chrysogenum was evaluated by direct bioassay against Micrococcus luteus ATCC 9341. The enzyme required dithiothreitol, was inactivated by 0.2 mM Hg2+ (100%), Zn2+ (80%), Cu2+ (60%), 1 mM N-ethylmaleimide (80%), and showed maximal catalytic activity at pH 8.4 and 20 degrees C. The V50 values for phenylacetyl-CoA and 6-aminopenicillanic acid were 0.55 mM and 1 microM, respectively. When octanoyl-CoA was employed as substrate similar results were obtained. In both cases the product generated showed strong antibacterial activity which was quickly lost when incubation was carried out with beta-lactamase. Reactions performed in the presence of Escherichia coli penicillin acylase did not generated active products when phenylacetyl-CoA was the substrate; they did with octanoyl-CoA. Time-course experiments revealed that the highest enzyme levels are found in 36 hours mycelium and remained almost constant from 48 to 96 hours; thereafter the level of the enzyme slowly decreased.
TI  - Chiral DNA gyrase inhibitors. 1. Synthesis and antimicrobial activity of the enantiomers of 6-fluoro-7-(1-piperazinyl)-1-(2'-trans-phenyl-1'-cyclopropyl)-1, 4-dihydro-4-oxoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid.
AB  - New quinolone antimicrobial agents (racemic, (1'S,2'R)- and (1'R,2'S)-6-fluoro-7-(1-piperazinyl)-1-(2'-trans-phenyl-1'-cyclopropyl)- 1, 4-dihydro-4-oxoquinoline-3-carboxylic acids) were synthesized, and their in vitro antimicrobial potencies and spectra were determined. As compared to their conceptual parents, these agents retained a considerable amount of the antimicrobial potency and spectra of ciprofloxacin and of 6-fluoro-1-phenyl-7-(1-piperazinyl)-1,4-dihydro-4-oxoquinoline-3-carboxy lic acid against Gram-positives. Gram-negatives were considerably less sensitive. The (-)-(1'S,2'R) analogue was the more potent of the enantiomers, but the degree of chiral discrimination by most bacteria was only 4-fold. The 4-fold chiral discrimination was observed also using purified DNA gyrase obtained from Micrococcus luteus, whereas the two enantiomers were essentially equiactive against the enzyme derived from Escherichia coli. These results confirm that there is a substantial degree of bulk tolerance available at N-1 of quinolone antimicrobial agents and suggest that electronic factors controlled by substitution at that site are of considerable importance. On the other hand, chiral recognition brought about by attachment of optically active groups to the N-1 position in these derivatives is relatively small.
TI  - Bifilar enzyme-sensitive sites in ultraviolet-irradiated DNA are indicative of closely opposed cyclobutyl pyrimidine dimers.
AB  - Incubation of UV-irradiated DNA with pyrimidine dimer-DNA glycosylase in cell-free lysates prepared from Micrococcus luteus results in the appearance of double-strand breaks. It has previously been assumed that such double-strand breaks result from cleavage at closely opposed dimers. We have used hybrid molecules of bacteriophage T7 DNA comprised of two unirradiated strands, two UV-irradiated strands, or one unirradiated and one UV-irradiated strand to test this hypothesis. Bifilar cleavage was observed only with molecules consisting of two irradiated strands and no bifilar cleavage was observed after the monomerization of pyrimidine dimers by enzymatic photoreactivation. Our results indicate that at least 80% of the double-strand breaks result from cleavage at closely opposed dimers and that the induction of dimers in one strand does not influence the induction of dimers at closely opposed positions in the complementary strand of a DNA double helix.
TI  - Defence reactions of Glossina morsitans morsitans against different species of bacteria and Trypanosoma brucei brucei.
AB  - Tsetse flies, Glossina morsitans morsitans, fed on rats infected with Trypanosoma brucei brucei showed wide fluctuations in total and differential haemocyte counts. Similar fluctuations occurred in controls fed on non-infected rats and also between the two groups without showing any difference which could be attributed to the infection. Trypanosome infection of the tsetse haemocoel occurred in 16.25% of the flies, starting from the second day after feeding on the infected rats, but salivary glands and proboscis became infected only after the eleventh day. About 2% of bloodstream forms of T. b. brucei injected into tsetse haemocoels completed their developmental cycle successfully. Injection of tsetse homogenates into teneral G. m. morsitans prior to exposure to trypanosome-infected feed increased T. b. brucei infections in the flies significantly. Injection of live Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus into tsetse induced a remarkable increase in two pre-existing haemolymph proteins with molecular weights of about 70 and 17 kilodaltons, while live Bacillus subtilis and Micrococcus luteus induced a very weak response or sometimes none at all. T. b. brucei also failed to induce any increase in these proteins. Inoculation of G. m. morsitans with live E. coli und T. b. brucei prior to feeding on trypanosome-infected rats had no effect on the salivary gland and proboscis infection rates by T. b. brucei. Injection of live T. b. brucei into the haemocoels of tsetse caused no change in total haemocyte counts, but the trypanosomes disappeared from the haemolymph so rapidly that by 48 h post-injection, only about 1% were left.
TI  - Higher pyrimidine dimer yields in skin of normal humans with higher UVB sensitivity.
AB  - We have measured UVB (280-320 nm)-induced DNA damage in skin of individuals with  different sensitivities to UVB irradiation as measured by minimal erythema dose (MED). The DNA damage was susceptible to cleavage by Micrococcus luteus UV endonuclease, which recognizes pyrimidine dimers in DNA. An alkaline agarose gel electrophoresis method was used to quantitate the number of M. luteus UV endonuclease-sensitive sites in nonradioactive DNA from skin biopsies of 7 individuals irradiated with UVB (0-180 mJ X cm-2). The production of sites correlated well with MED (correlation coefficient = 0.78). The slope of the dose response curve for the most UVB-sensitive individual (MED = 24 mJ X cm-2) and for the least UVB-sensitive individual (MED = 146 mJ X cm-2) were 11.5 X 10(-4) and 2.6 X 10(-4) sites per 1000 bases per mJ X cm-2, respectively. The UVB-induced DNA damage was determined to be pyrimidine dimers by its susceptibility to cleavage by M. luteus UV endonuclease and its photoreactivability by Escherichia coli photoreactivating enzyme.
TI  - Quantitation of carcinogen-induced DNA damage and repair in human cells with the  UVR ABC excision nuclease from Escherichia coli.
AB  - Recent studies by others have shown that the endonuclease complex coded for by the uvrA, uvrB and uvrC genes of Escherichia coli (UVR ABC excision nuclease) can incise DNA containing a variety of 'bulk-type' lesions, such as those resulting from u.v. light, (+/-)-7 alpha,8 beta-dihydroxy-9 alpha,10 alpha-epoxy-7,8,9,10-tetrahydrobenzo[a]pyrene (anti-BPDE), and N-acetoxy-2-acetylaminofluorene. Using partially purified UVR ABC excision nuclease, we have quantitated the number of endonuclease sensitive sites (ESS) in purified DNA isolated from human fibroblasts treated with u.v. light or BPDE. The number of ESS/10(8) daltons of DNA were calculated from the number average mol. wt. of the DNA as determined by sedimentation in alkaline sucrose gradients. The number of endonuclease sites increased linearly with increasing doses of either u.v. light or BPDE. The UVR ABC excision nuclease was able to incise a majority of the BPDE-DNA adducts. Xeroderma pigmentosum fibroblasts, complementation group A (XP12BE) had 20-25% more ESS at each dose than the BPDE-treated normal (HSBP) cells. Cells treated with 4 microM BPDE and allowed 12 h of incubation to perform excision repair showed removal of 60% of the initial number of ESS from HSBP DNA and 40% of the ESS from XP-A DNA. Beyond 12 h XP12BE cells lost no additional ESS while HSBP cells continued to lose ESS, although at a slower rate, until at 48 h only 22% of the initial ESS remained. In cells treated with 10 J/m2 of u.v. light, the UVR ABC excision nuclease detected 60% of the sites recognized by the pyridimine dimer specific Micrococcus luteus glycosylase/apyrimidinic endonuclease. These results demonstrate the potential use of the UVR ABC excision nuclease in a quantitative assay for determining the number of carcinogen-induced lesions in human DNA.
TI  - Cloning of Micrococcus luteus 3-methyladenine-DNA glycosylase genes in Escherichia coli.
AB  - The 3-methyladenine-DNA glycosylase (m3ADG) excises 3-methyladenine (m3A) residues formed in DNA after treatment with alkylating agents. In Escherichia coli, the repair of this type of damage depends on the products of the genes tagA and/or alkA, which code for m3ADG I (20 kDa) and II (30 kDa), respectively. The tagA- and alkA--single mutants are sensitive to alkylating agents, the double mutant much more so. We have cloned two genes of Micrococcus luteus that can partly substitute the function of the E. coli tagA- and alkA- genes. An M. luteus genome bank was made by shotgun cloning of EcoRI + BamHI-digested DNA into pBR322. Two hybrid plasmids were identified that confer methylmethane sulfonate (MMS) resistance to the tagA- ada+ mutant and a capacity to reactivate MMS-treated bacteriophage lambda. Each hybrid plasmid directed the synthesis of 21-kDa m3ADG in E. coli tagA- ada-, which were not inhibited by 4 mM m3A. However, the restriction maps of the two cloned genes were different, and they showed no sequence homology as judged by the lack of cross hybridization.
TI  - [The capacity of anaerobically grown bacteria to exchange the 2H+ of the cell for the K+ of the medium and to maintain a high K+ distribution between cell and medium].
AB  - The N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide sensitive exchange of 2H+ of a cell for K+ of medium stable to pH, K+ activity and temperature changes has been discovered in anaerobically grown gram-negative Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium. S. enteritidis, Proteus mirabilis, P. vulgaris, anaerobic gram-positive bacteria Streptococcus faecalis, Lactobacillus salivarius, L. lactis in the presence of exogenic energy source. This exchange in gram-negative bacteria is operating only at increase of medium osmolarity. The high K+ distribution between cell and medium has been reached during the exchange of 2H+ for one K+ and the corresponding potassium equilibrium potential is much more than the measured delta psi. In aerobically grown E. coli, S. typhimurium, Brevibacterium flavum and aerobic Micrococcus luteus exchange of 2H+ for K+ does not take place, the K+ distribution is lower and in good conformity with the measured delta psi. It is assumed that exchange of 2H+ for K+ in anaerobic bacteria is carried out by the H+-ATPase complex and the Trk (or Trk-like) system of K+ absorption united into the same membrane supercomplex which functions as the H+-K+-pump and supports the high K+ distribution between cell and medium.
TI  - The repair of pyrimidine dimers via a DNA-glycosylase mechanism.
AB  - The "UV endonuclease" isolated either from M. luteus or bacteriophage T4 infected E. coli (the denV gene product) consists of two enzymatic activities on a single polypeptide chain: a pyrimidine dimer-DNA glycosylase and an AP endonuclease. The repair of pyrimidine dimers by this enzyme is initiated by the cleavage of the N-glycosylic bond of the 5' pyrimidine of the dimer that leaves the cyclobutane dimer still attached to the DNA through the N-glycosylic bond of the 3' pyrimidine of the dimer. This reaction results in the formation of an apyrimidinic site in the DNA. The second step in this repair pathway is the endonucleolytic cleavage of the DNA 3' to the AP site by the associated AP endonuclease. As a result, the nicked DNA contains DNA damage on both sides of the incision site: an apyrimidinic moiety on the 3' end and a thymine-thymidylate dimer on the 5' end. The enzymes prefer double stranded DNA over single stranded DNA, and thymine over cytosine at the 5' position of the dimer. The AP endonuclease activity prefers the AP site created by the pyrimidine dimer-DNA glycosylase on UV irradiated DNA over either apurinic or apyrimidinic DNA. This repair mechanism appears to be operative in vivo since DNA intermediates containing thymine-thymidylate dimer sites have been detected in UV irradiated T4 infected E. coli and in UV irradiated M. luteus. The cloned denV gene partially complements the UV repair deficient uvr A, B, C strains of E. coli.
TI  - [Antibacterial properties of some spice plants before and after heat treatment].
AB  - This study was carried out to understand the antibacterial properties of some spice plants before and after heat treatment in boiling water. The samples included the core and the outer layers of onion, the white and the green parts of green onion, garlic bulb, ginger, ginger root, sweet pepper, chili pepper, brown pepper, and mustard. The test microorganisms included Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus vulgaris, Staphylococcus aureus, Mycobacterium phlei, Streptococcus faecalis, Bacillus cereus, and Micrococcus luteus. Raw garlic bulb could inhibit all of the test strains. The antibacterial activities of green onion are slightly weak than that of onion. However, green onion could inhibit P. aeruginosa and M. luteus, but onion could inhibit E. coli, P. vulgaris, S. faecalis, and B. cereus. Ginger and ginger root could only inhibit M. luteus. Chili pepper could inhibit V. parahaemolyticus and P. vulgaris. Brown pepper could also inhibit P. vulgaris. Sweet pepper and mustard showed no antibacterial activity to all of the test strains. In general, antibacterial components in the spice plants were heat labile. All the spices tested lost their antibacterial activities within 20 min at 100 degrees C.
TI  - [Reactivity to bacterial peptidoglycans in a phagocytosis system. The range of immunological specificity of Escherichia coli peptidoglycan].
AB  - The antigenic specificity of E. coli M17 peptidoglycans (PG) was studied in the test system based on the stimulation of neutrophils with PG opsonized with the whole and exhausted IgG fraction of human serum. Within the generic taxon, the PG under study were similar in their antigenic properties. The opsonic activity of IgG exhausted with the preparations of different E. coli strains decreased by 93.2-95.8%. An essential difference of E. coli PG from similar components of other representatives of the family Enterobacteriaceae was observed: in experiments with Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus rettgeri the decrease of opsonic activity was 47.6-79.3%. After the removal of antibodies to PG of remote taxons (Staphylococcus aureus, Micrococcus luteus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus faecalis, Branchamella catarrhalis) the decrease of the opsonic effect was less noticeable (9.7-33.8%). The results are discussed from the viewpoint of the immunological peculiarity of PG at different taxonomic levels.
TI  - N-terminal analogues of cecropin A: synthesis, antibacterial activity, and conformational properties.
AB  - Six analogues of the 37-residue antibacterial peptide cecropin A were synthesized by the solid-phase method: cecropin A-(2-37), [Glu2]cecropin A, [Pro4]cecropin A, [Glu6]cecropin A, [Leu6]cecropin A, and [Pro8]cecropin A. Their antibacterial activities against four test organisms were determined and related to conformational changes observed in their CD spectra and were discussed on the basis of a previously proposed amphipathic alpha-helix model. An aromatic residue in position 2 was shown to be important for activity against all tested bacteria. The highly alpha-helical 1-11 region of cecropin A did not appear to play a significant role in its activity against Escherichia coli but was clearly involved in its interaction against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus megaterium, and Micrococcus luteus.
TI  - Template properties of ultraviolet-irradiated poly(dC) replicated by E. coli DNA  polymerase I: indication for a role of apyrimidinic-sites in UV-induced mutagenesis.
AB  - Ultraviolet irradiation alters the template properties of poly(dC) when replicated by Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I. These effects are due to base modifications. Some of them are identified as apurinic/apyrimidinic sites (AP-sites) by their sensitivity to AP-endonuclease B purified from Micrococcus luteus, and their template properties. The rate of formation of AP-sites in poly(dC) is estimated at 3 X 10(-7) site per nucleotide per J.m-2. Exposure of supercoiled or relaxed pBR322 DNA to UV light results also in the formation of sites sensitive to AP-endonuclease B. In this case, the rate of formation of AP-sites is the same in relaxed or supercoiled DNA: 0.3 X 10(-7) site per nucleotide per J.m-2. The apyrimidinic sites are generated through the processing of an ultraviolet induced primary lesion. We suggest that this lesion is cytosine hydrate by its rate of decay and preferential formation in single stranded DNA. Our results suggest that AP-sites might be a minor pathway leading to UV-induced mutagenesis.
TI  - Repair of nonreplicating UV-irradiated DNA: cooperative dark repair by Escherichia coli uvr and phr functions.
AB  - The system previously used to study recombination of nonreplicating UV-irradiated phage lambda DNA was adapted to study UV repair. Irradiated phages infected undamaged homoimmune lysogens. Pyrimidine dimer content (by treatment with Micrococcus luteus UV endonuclease and alkaline sucrose sedimentation) and a biological activity endpoint (infectivity in transfection of uvrB recA recB spheroplasts) were followed. Unless room light was excluded during DNA extraction procedures, photoreactivation (Phr function) was significant. In uvr delta phr bacteria, repair, by both assays, was very low but not zero. Even when light was totally excluded, Phr function appeared to play a role in Uvr-mediated excision repair: both dimer removal and restoration of infectivity were two to five times as efficient in uvr+ phr+ bacteria as in uvr+ delta phr bacteria. Similarly, UV-irradiated phages plated with higher efficiencies on phr+ than delta phr bacteria even under totally dark conditions. In uvr phr+ repressed infections, removal of dimers from nonreplicating DNA did not increase infectivity as much as in uvr+ infections, suggesting a requirement for repair of nondimer photoproducts by the uvrABC system.
TI  - Excision of uracil residues in DNA: mechanism of action of Escherichia coli and Micrococcus luteus uracil-DNA glycosylases.
AB  - Various octadeoxynucleotides containing uracil at different positions were synthesized and submitted to the action of Escherichia coli and Micrococcus luteus uracil-DNA glycosylases. A uracil residue situated at the 5'-end was excised by the M.luteus enzyme but not by the E.coli one. Uracil residues located at the ultimate and penultimate positions at the 3'-end were not cleaved by either enzymes. At the other central positions, uracil was eliminated with different initial velocities. Single stranded phi X 174 DNA fragments were used to study the influence of the sequence. Cytosine bases were deaminated to give uracil by bisulfite treatment. It was shown that the initial excision velocity of two vicinal uracil residues was decreased. The same observation was made for two uracils separated by one base. A hypothetical scheme is suggested to explain the mechanism of action of uracil-DNA glycosylases.
TI  - Antimicrobial effect of sugar osazones and anhydro sugars.
AB  - The antimicrobial effect of 14 sugar osazones and anhydro sugars was studied with model strains of Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus licheniformis, Escherichia coli and strains Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from clinical material. The relationship between the structure of these compounds, their solubility in water and 1-octanol and antimicrobial effect was investigated.
TI  - Synthesis and properties of poly 5-methylthiouridylic acid.
AB  - In an effort to search for good methods for the enzymatic synthesis of polynucleotide analogs with antitemplate activity, 5-methylthiouridine-5'-diphosphate (ms5UDP) has been synthesized and investigated as a substrate for polynucleotide phosphorylase. While ms5UDP was polymerized at a very low rate to give a 6% yield of polynucleotides by the polynucleotide phosphorylase of Micrococcus luteus, it was utilized more efficiently by the corresponding enzyme of Escherichia coli resulting in a 15% yield of poly (5-methylthiouridylic) acid. Results of the co-polymerization of ms5UDP and UDP revealed that the ratio of 5-methylthiouridylate to uridylate residues in the polynucleotide product was lower than the ratio of ms5UDP to UDP in the substrate mixture. The 5-methylthio group conferred only minute changes on the conformation of the modified polyuridylic acid, and the complexes formed between poly-(5-methylthiouridylic) acid and poly(adenylic) acid possessed slightly higher Tm values than did the unmodified counterparts. Poly(5-methylthiouridylic) acid was a potent inhibitor of calf thymus DNA polymerase alpha.
TI  - Synthesis of RNA I by the RNA polymerase from Micrococcus luteus on the Escherichia coli plasmid pBR322.
AB  - Incubation of DNA-dependent RNA polymerase from Micrococcus luteus (gram-positive) with the plasmid pBR322 under transcription conditions in vitro leads to the formation of a rather short-chained RNA. This transcript is initiated at the same site on pBR322 as RNA I, a defined Escherichia coli RNA polymerase product. M. luteus RNA polymerase initiates transcription at the RNA I site much more efficiently than the E. coli enzyme, using either a plasmid preparation of pBR322 or an appropriate linear restriction fragment as template. In the latter case, cleavage of the restriction fragment 24 or 71 nucleotides (but not 91 nucleotides) upstream of the initiation site destroys template activity. By sequence analysis it was determined that the 3' terminus of the M. luteus RNA polymerase transcription product is identical with that known for RNA I. Moreover, in agreement with synthesis of RNA I by E. coli RNA polymerase in vitro, termination by the M. luteus enzyme is also a stutter process characterized by the same dependence on the available UTP concentration. These observations lead to the hypothesis that termination by eubacterial RNA polymerases might not be species-specific.
TI  - HMG17 protein facilitates the DNA catenation reaction catalyzed by DNA topoisomerases.
AB  - HMG17 protein is shown to greatly facilitate the catention of double-stranded DNA rings catalyzed by DNA topoisomerases. Even at low DNA concentrations such that catenanes are not observable in the absence of HMG17, the addition of the protein promotes the catenation of greater than 95% of the input DNA into networks that do not enter the gel upon electrophoresis. Electron microscopy and restriction enzyme cleavage experiments indicate that these networks are large structures containing many catenated DNA rings. The HMG17-promoted DNA network formation has been observed with calf thymus type II DNA topoisomerase and the type I topoisomerases of Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, and calf thymus.
TI  - Staphylococcus aureus and Micrococcus luteus peptidoglycan transglycosylases that are not penicillin-binding proteins.
AB  - Major peptidoglycan transglycosylase activities, which synthesize uncross-linked  peptidoglycan from lipid-linked precursors, were solubilized from the membranes of Staphylococcus aureus and Micrococcus luteus and were partially purified. The transglycosylase activities were separated from penicillin-binding proteins by solubilization and by purification steps. Therefore, we concluded that these activities were not activities of the penicillin-binding proteins, which are the presumptive peptidoglycan transpeptidases in these gram-positive cocci. Unlike Escherichia coli, in which the network structure of peptidoglycan is synthesized by multiple two-headed penicillin-binding proteins with both transpeptidase and transglycosylase activities, these gram-positive cocci have cell wall peptidoglycan which seems to be synthesized by penicillin-binding protein transpeptidases and a separate transglycosylase.
TI  - New streptothricin-group antibiotics, AN-201 I and II. Screening, fermentation, isolation, structure and biological activity.
AB  - Two streptothricin-group antibiotics, AN-201 I and II, were newly discovered and  isolated from the culture broth of Streptomyces nojiriensis C-13. These antibiotics were purified by IRC-50 (H+) and CM-Sephadex C-50 chromatography, and paper electrophoresis. Structural analysis of AN-201 I and II showed that they were N beta-acetylated derivatives of streptothricin E and D, respectively. They had antibacterial activities against several strains of Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus and Staphylococcus aureus, and showed a strong selective cytotoxic effect on 3T3 cells transformed with SV-40 as compared with their normal cells in a test system in vitro as well as in vivo.
TI  - Presence of a new cytochrome b - like pigment with a peak at 567 nm in various aerobic bacteria.
AB  - Several physiological groups of bacteria were examined for the presence of a cytochrome b - like pigment which is demonstrable in dithionite-reduced minus substrate-reduced difference spectra. This pigment is characterized by an unusually high alpha band at 567 nm, a low concentration relative to conventional cytochromes, and an inability to be fully reduced by endogenous substrates or NADH. Previous studies with one denitrifying and nondenitrifying species of the genus Pseudomonas, in Paracoccus denitrificans, in Alcaligenes faecalis, in Azotobacter vinelandii, in Branhamella catarrhalis, and in Neisseria lactamicus. In all these organisms, the peak of the 567-nm pigment is accompanied by a peak of about equal height at approximately 559 nm, which exhibits similar properties to the 567-nm pigment. The 567-nm pigment was not demonstrable by this technique in Gluconobacter oxydans subspecies suboxydans, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus licheniformis, Aeromonas hydrophilia, Escherichia coli, a Klebsiella species, Moraxella osloensis, Aquaspirillum itersonii, Micrococcus lysodeikticus, Micrococcus luteus, Agrobacterium tumefaciens, or Rhizobium meliloti.
TI  - Microbiological investigations on cryopreserved human semen.
AB  - Primary mycological contamination was studied in 565 random human ejaculates. After sperm preservation at low temperature, secondary mycological contamination of 55 of the ejaculates was investigated. 25 ejaculates were cryopreserved with and without antibiotics and examined bacteriologically before and after different phases of cryopreservation. Furthermore, semen samples of several donors were inoculated with suspensions of different concentrations of yeasts and with the test bacteria Escherichia coli K 12 and Staphylococcus aureus SG 511. Microbiological results were then compared before and after cryopreservation. The following results were obtained: 1.9.8% of samples showed primary mycological contamination (1.9% with Candida albicans). 2. Cryopreservation reduced the concentration of fungi by more than 90% on average. 3. Only one semen sample was contaminated with bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus haemolyticus and Streptococcus nonhaemolyticus). Non-pathogenic bacteria were found in 11 ejaculates (Micrococcus luteus in 5 samples and Staphylococcus epidermidis in 6 samples), and contamination was largely unaffected by cryopreservation, even in the presence of antibiotics. 4. Test bacteria inoculated into semen were not influenced by the addition of antibiotics to the cryoprotective medium.
TI  - [Effect of antibiotic AL-87 on the fatty acid composition of microorganisms in different taxonomic groups].
AB  - The effect of antibiotic A1-87 on the fatty acid composition of S. aureus 209, E. coli O26 and M. luteus 169 significantly differing in this property was studied. The sub-bacteriostatic doses of the preparation induced the appearance of unsaturated fatty acids in S. aureus 209. These acids were not detected in the control cultures. They also significantly increased the content of the saturated branched fatty acid with 15 carbon atoms in this culture and decreased the content of the fatty acid of the same type with 19 carbon atoms. In E. coli O25 there was an almost two-fold increase in the content of the unsaturated straight chain fatty acids with a respective decrease in the content of cyclopropanoic acid and a markedly pronounced decrease in the content of nonadecanoic acid. In M. luteus 169 the content of the saturated branched fatty acid with 15 carbon atoms increased, while the content of the unsaturated straight chain fatty acids (C16:1, C18:1) decreased, the content of hexadecanoic acid being decreased almost two times. According to the present status the differences in the fatty acid composition of the above organisms are interpreted as one of the mechanisms increasing the membrane permeability.
TI  - Ensifer adhaerens Predatory Activity Against Other Bacteria in Soil, as Monitored by Indirect Phage Analysis.
AB  - An indirect phage analysis procedure was used to detect and follow the activity of the bacterial predator Ensifer adhaerens in situ in natural soil. The soil was percolated with an aqueous suspension of washed bacterial host cells so that the E. adhaerens cells naturally present in the soil would multiply in response to the host cells. The natural phage development which ensued against these multiplying E. adhaerens cells in the soil was then monitored by noting plaques which developed when the percolation fluid was plated with laboratory strains of E. adhaerens on laboratory media. The activities of the other members of the predation system that includes E. adhaerens (Streptomyces sp. strain 34 and a myxobacter) could not be monitored directly by phage analysis because phage were not found for them. Indirect monitoring was possible, however, because they were susceptible to attack by E. adhaerens. In general, the results were in agreement with previous observations by other methods of the predation sequence. E. adhaerens attacked Micrococcus luteus, Streptomyces sp. strain 34, and the myxobacter but did not attack several other possible species of hosts. It also did not respond to percolation of the soil with various nutrient solutions. E. adhaerens phage activity was not present in half of the soils percolated with M. luteus cells. This seemed to reflect too great a phage-host specificity for the technique as regards these soils, because E. adhaerens-like bacteria other than the strains used for plaquing were present in at least some of these soils. Although E. adhaerens did not attack Escherichia coli or Pseudomonas aeruginosa in soil, there was an overproduction of E. adhaerens phage if these bacteria were percolated simultaneously with M. luteus cells. The possibility is discussed that this represents an activation by M. luteus (or by a heat-extractable factor from it) of other bacterial predators that attack E. coli or P. aeruginosa and that these predators subsequently are themselves attacked by E. adhaerens.
TI  - Flow dichroism evidence for tilting of the bases when DNA is in solution.
AB  - Flow linear dichroism studies of DNAs from Clostridium perfringens, Escherichia coli, and Micrococcus luteus are extended into the vacuum UV region to 175 nm. The short-wavelength pi pi region shows a less negative reduced linear dichroism than the well-studied long-wavelength pi pi region. These results are independent of the type of DNA and the concentration of salt over the range 0.001 to 1.0 M. This proves that the bases are not perpendicular to the flow orientation. Assuming that the DNA tends to align along its helix axis, the largest angle that the bases can make with the helix axis is 73 +/- 3 degrees.
TI  - Quantitation of pyrimidine dimer contents of nonradioactive deoxyribonucleic acid by electrophoresis in alkaline agarose gels.
AB  - We have developed a method of quantitating the pyrimidine dimer content of nonradioactive DNAs. DNA samples are treated with the UV-endonuclease from Micrococcus luteus and then separated according to molecular weight by electrophoresis on alkaline agarose gels. From their migration relative to known molecular weight standards, their median molecular weights and thus the number of dimers per DNA molecule in each sample can be calculated. Results of action spectra for dimer formation in T7 bacteriophage measured by this method agree well with action spectra for T7 killing. In addition, the method gives dimer yields in good agreement with those obtained by others using alkaline sucrose gradient sedimentation.
TI  - Ribonuclease H from chick embryos cleaves precisely at the junction between the RNA and DNA portion of the hybrid helix.
AB  - DNA polymerase from Micrococcus luteus and RNA polymerase from E. coli catalyze the synthesis of poly(dA) with poly(dT) template, in the presence of ATP and [alpha-32P]dATP. The reaction is completely dependent on poly(A) primer synthesis. Poly(A) chains are covalently extended by DNA polymerase. Primer poly(A) is linked to the product poly(dA) via a 3':5'-phosphodiester bond, and can be specifically removed by ribonuclease H from chick embryos, leaving a 5'-phosphate end of poly(dA). The length of RNA and DNA products appears to be relatively variable. The size of the DNA is less than 3 000 nucleotides.
TI  - Coding properties of poly(deoxycytidylic acid) templates containing uracil or apyrimidinic sites: in vitro modulation of mutagenesis by deoxyribonucleic acid repair enzymes.
AB  - Heat treatment of poly(deoxycytidylic acid)-[poly(dC)] induces the formation of dUMP residues, which code for dAMP when replicated by Escherichia coli DNA polymerases I and III. The specificity of dUMP coding properties is indicated by the quantitative relation between the dAMP incorporated and the frequency of dUMP residues in the heat-treated poly(dC). The dAMP incorporation is prevented by preincubation of uracil containing poly(dC) with uracil-DNA glycosylase. The excision of uracil by uracil-DNA glycosylase leads to the formation of apyrimidinic sites (AP sites), which are barely replicated in vitro under physiological conditions. However, the alteration of E. coli DNA polymerase I fidelity of replication by Mn2+ greatly stimulates the replication of AP sites. There is a preferential incorporation of dAMP, as compared to dTMP, opposite the AP sites. The dAMP incorporation is prevented by preincubation of poly(dC) containing AP sites with Micrococcus luteus AP endonuclease B. The results show a close association between DNA repair by base excision and the prevention of mutagenic processes in vitro. Furthermore, since the alteration of DNA polymerase fidelity allows some replication of the noncoding DNA lesion (AP site), this could imply a role in SOS-induced mutagenesis in vivo.
TI  - Antibacterial and antimycotic effect of a newly discovered secretion from larvae  of an endoparasitic insect, Pimpla turionellae L. (hym.).
AB  - The larvae of Pimpla turionellae, that develop in pupae of various Lepidoptera, discharged through their anus up to 8 microliters/h of a hyaline liquid, which is termed "anal secretion". It exerted a strong bacteriostatic effect on Enterobacter cloacae, a highly virulent intestinal microorganism isolated from the midgut of the host pupa, Pieris brassicae. Growth inhibition of Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus and Pseudomonas phaseolicola was also evident, but less pronounced. Inhibition depended upon the concentration of the anal secretion. This was also true regarding the effect on growth of Beauveria bassiana, a fungus pathogenic on insects. The antimycotic action of the anal secretion was less effective against Chaetomium pululiferum, a soil-inhabiting fungus. Growing hyphae of B. bassiana were malformed, exhibiting the so-called "curling effect", when treated with anal secretion. Parenteral injection of a low dose of Enterobacter cloacae resulted in 100% mortality of non parasitized pupae of Pieris brassicae; however, simultaneous injection of 3 microliters of anal secretion resulted in higher survival.
TI  - Poly(7-deazaguanylic acid), the homopolynucleotide of the parent nucleoside of queuosine.
AB  - Poly(7-deazaguanylic acid) was enzymatically synthesized by the polymerization of 7-deazaguanosine 5'-diphosphate with polynucleotide phosphorylase from Micrococcus luteus in high yield. The homopolymer showed a similar thermal and total hypochromicity to poly(G) at the long wavelength absorption maximum. No sigmoid melting profile was observed for poly(c7G) as is found for poly(G), implying a single-stranded structure in aqueous solution. From the circular dichroism spectra it can be concluded that the 7-deazapurine nucleotide is much more flexible than the purine nucleotide. In analogy to poly(G), the homopolymer poly(c7G) forms a 1:1 complex with poly(C) under neutral conditions, melting at a similar temperature to the poly(G) complex. However, at pH 2.5, where a poly(G) X 2poly(C) complex is observed, poly(c7G) still binds only one poly(C) strand. This is due to the lack of N-7 in poly(c7G), not allowing Hoogsteen base pair formation, which occurs with poly(G). RNase T1 cleaves poly(c7G), indicating that N-7 of guanosine is not a requirement for nucleotide binding to the enzyme, as has been suggested. Because of the single-stranded structure of poly(c7G), the polynucleotide chain is rapidly hydrolyzed by the single-strand-specific nuclease S1, whereas multistranded poly(G) is completely resistant.
TI  - Comparison at the molecular level of uracil-DNA glycosylases from different origins.
AB  - A nuclear and a cytoplasmic uracil-DNA glycosylase have been purified from epithelial cells derived from a rat hepatoma (H4 cells) cultured in vitro. They have different optimum pH, molecular weight, isoelectric points, activation energy, Km. Uracil acts as a non competitive inhibitor towards the nuclear enzyme while it is a competitive one for the cytoplasmic enzyme. Comparison of the properties of the two mammalian enzymes with those of the enzymes isolated from Escherichia coli and Micrococcus luteus shows that they all behave differently. The following criteria were studied: molecular weight, optimum pH, isoelectric point, inhibition by uracil analogs, modulation of their activity by polyamines or by intercalating drugs. The only common properties shared by these four enzymes are: an activity twice as high on single stranded DNA than on double stranded DNA and no requirement for divalent cation for maximal activity.
TI  - Species specificity of promoter recognition by RNA polymerase and its transfer by the sigma factor.
AB  - RNA polymerase holoenzyme from Micrococcus luteus synthesizes in vitro a run-off  transcript of 85 nucleotides from a DNA fragment containing part of gene E of bacteriophage phi X174. This RNA starts with GTP as the 5' terminus 18 nucleotides downstream from the start of gene E on the viral (+)strand. Transcription does not occur when the fragment is cleaved 36 nucleotides upstream of the initiation site. No transcript is obtained with RNA polymerase core or holoenzyme from Escherichia coli. Other DNA fragments containing the three major E. coli promoters of phi X174 are transcribed by both enzymes although much less efficiently by M. luteus RNA polymerase. When subunit sigma in E. coli RNA polymerase is replaced by sigma from M. luteus the resulting hybrid enzyme actively transcribes the DNA fragment containing the inner region of gene D with formation of the same run-off transcript which is obtained with M. luteus holoenzyme. In the presence of sigma from E. coli this RNA is not synthesized. The hybrid enzyme also transcribes a DNA fragment containing the gene A promoter of phi X174 with even higher efficiency than RNA polymerase holoenzyme from E. coli.
TI  - Antimicrobial characteristic of insoluble alkylpyridinium iodide.
AB  - Insoluble and soluble alkylpyridinium iodides (C8 to C18) were synthesized. The insoluble agents were quaternized 4-vinylpyridine-divinylbenzene copolymers. The insoluble agent [C12(50)] that contained 50% divinylbenzene and had a C12 alkyl chain was selected as the most suitable insoluble agent. C12(50) showed poor durability of the antibacterial activity, but C12(50), which had lost the activity, was refreshed by washing with ethanol. This washing became ineffective after a few cycles of antibacterial treatment and refreshment. Such C12(50) recovered the activity upon 1.0 N NaOH treatment. The antibacterial activity of C12(50) depended on its surface area. It showed high antimicrobial activity against gram-positive bacteria and also showed activity against gram-negative bacteria and yeasts. But the activities of C12(50) and laurylpyridinium iodide solution were different against some microbes. The antibacterial activities of the agents were investigated against Escherichia coli and Micrococcus luteus under various conditions. The activity of C12(50) was higher at a higher temperature or at a lower cell concentration. The activity of C12(50) decreased on addition of NaCl, glucose, or bovine albumin to the cell suspension or in 0.01 M sodium-potassium phosphate buffer. C12(50) showed less activity when cells were mixed with dead cells or the supernatant of dead cells killed in an autoclave. The mode of action of the laurylpyridinium iodide solution against E. coli and M. luteus was similar to that of C12(50) except for the influence of E. coli cell concentration.
TI  - Characterization of polynucleotide phosphorylase from Micrococcus luteus and isolation of the 13,000 base poly(A) product of the polymerization reaction.
AB  - A new purification procedure for polynucleotide phosphorylase from freeze-dried Micrococcus luteus cells gives approximately 20% yield of nearly homogeneous, primer-independent enzyme which is free of nucleic acid. The physicochemical properties of M. luteus polynucleotide phosphorylase are similar to those previously described for the enzyme from Escherichia coli in terms of Mr, subunit structure, and amino acid composition. The purified enzyme appears to be a trimer composed of three identical subunits (Mr 92,000), but it probably does not exist as such in the cell. Ferguson plot analyses of enzyme in cell extracts indicate that prior to purification the enzyme exists in oligomeric forms characterized by both higher charge and greater Mr. Changes in size and charge of oligomers which occur during purification are probably due to the dissociation of proteins and/or nucleic acids. Dissociation of the oligomers is achieved by dilution and electrophoresis, but reassociation does not occur after concentration. The poly(A) product of the initial polymerization stages migrates as a single band on both nondenaturing and urea-agarose gels. It is 13,000 +/- 2,000 nucleotides long, as measured by electron microscopy, and 8,000 nucleotides long by gel electrophoretic analysis. This poly(A) product remains bound to the enzyme after synthesis, yet can be easily obtained free of protein by proteinase K digestion.
TI  - Characterization of the lysozyme of Mytilus edulis (L).
AB  - 1. Lysozyme isolated from the crystalline style of Mytilus edulis is a true N-acetylmuramyl-hydrolase (E.C. 3.2.1.17). 2. THe enzyme is optimally active at approx pH 7.1, I = 0.011, with a secondary optimum at pH 4.6, I = 0.054. 3. Cell walls of Micrococcus luteus, Escherichia coli, and Bacillus subtilis were degraded by the lysozyme but chitin or cell walls of Staphylococcus aureus were resistant to its activity. 4. Tetra-N-acetyl chitotetraose inhibited enzyme activity more than N-acetylglucosamine, di-N-acetyl chitobiose, tri-N-acetyl chitotriose or penta-N-acetyl chitopentaose.
TI  - Caffeine inhibits DNA polymerase I from Escherichia coli: studies in vitro.
AB  - Caffeine inhibits the activity of DNA polymerase I (E. coli) and its proteolytic  large fragment in in vitro DNA replication system. DNA polymerase from Micrococcus luteus is also equally inhibited by caffeine. The extent of inhibition was more with the activated adenovirus, T4 and calf thymus DNA than with synthetic DNA template-primers. Results obtained from time-course studies indicated that caffeine inhibition reached maximum by 30 min of incubation. Enzyme kinetic studies showed that inhibition was competitive with respect to DNA template.
TI  - Nonspecific and cooperative binding of lectins to microorganisms.
AB  - Binding of lectins to microbial cell walls was investigated by fluorimetric titration and Scatchard plot. Data were correlated with agglutinability. Concanavalin A and lectins of wheat germ, soybean, pea, lentil, and peanut were tested against Escherichia coli. Micrococcus luteus, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Bacillus subtilis. In cases where binding occurred, it was either nonspecific or positively cooperative. Agglutination was observed only in those combinations of lectin and microorganism that showed positive cooperative binding, suggesting a definite relation between binding and agglutination. Lectins binding to the same carbohydrate did not necessarily bind to the same microorganism, confirming the complexity of the lectin-receptor bond.
TI  - [Acinetobacter isolates from environmental sampling in hospitals (author's transl)].
AB  - By environmental culturing Acinetobacter could be isolated from human sources and wet sites as well as from air and dry surfaces. In variety "anitratus" strains from patients and hospital personal resistance against antibiotics and metal salts was more dominant than in other strains. Acinetobacter strains were more tolerant of dryness than E. coli but less than Micrococcus luteus. By repeated contacts Acinetobacteres could be recovered from contaminated surfaces of polyvinyl chloride in significantly higher numbers than from paving tile.
TI  - Evidence that dimers remaining in preinduced Escherichia coli B/r Hcr+ become insensitive after DNA replication to the extract from Micrococcus luteus.
AB  - In Escherichia coli B/r Her+ irradiated with two separate fluences, dimer excision is prematurely interrupted. The present study was designed to follow tha fate of dimers remaining unexcised. The results imply that these dimers (or distortions containing dimers) are transformed on replication from the state of sensitivity to the state of insensitivity to endonuclease from Micrococcus luteus. This conclusion is based on the following findings: (a) dimers were radiochromatographically detectable in DNA replicated after UV, which indicated that they were tolerated on replication. (b) Similar amounts of dimers were detected radiochromatographically both in DNA remaining unreplicated and DNA twice replicated after UV, This along with the low transfer of parental label into daughter DNA, indicated that dimers remained in situ in parental chains. (c) Immediately after UV, all parental DNA contained numerous sites sensitive to the extract from M. luteus. 2 h after UV, a portion of parental DNA still contained a number of endonuclease-sensitive (Es) sites, while another portion of parental DNA and all daughter DNA were free of Es sites. (d) The occurrence of parental DNA free of Es sites was not temporally correlated with dimer excision, but with the first round of DNA replication. (e) The amount of DNA free of Es sites corresponded to the amount of replicated DNA. (f) Separation of replicated and unreplicated DNA, and detection of Es sites in both portions separately showed that the replicated DNA was almost free of Es sites, whereas unreplicated DNA contained a number of such sites.
TI  - Early steps of excision repair of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers by the Micrococcus luteus endonuclease. A three-step incision model.
AB  - The early steps of excision repair of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers are investigated. It is demonstrated that the apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease associated with the Micrococcus luteus uv-specific endonuclease cleaves the phosphodiester bond on the 3' side of the deoxyribose leaving a 3' hydroxy terminus and a 5' phosphoryl terminus. This nick is not a substrate for T4 polynucleotide ligase. The 3' base-free deoxyribose terminus is not a substrate for either the polymerase or the 3' to 5' exonuclease activities of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I. However, the 3' terminus of the nick is converted to a substrate for DNA polymerization by the action of a 5' apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease. A three-step model for the incision step of excision repair of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers is presented.
TI  - Strand cleavage at psoralen adducts and pyrimidine dimers in DNA caused by interaction between semi-purified uvr+ gene products from Escherichia coli.
AB  - Partially purified extracts of Escherichia coli containing either uvrA+ or a mixture of uvrB+ and uvrC+ gene products were tested for an endonuclease activity on DNA treated with 8-methoxypsoralen plus 360-nm light. Neither of these fractions was active alone. The combined fractions, however, caused extensive strand cleavage of the psoralen-treated DNA. The endonuclease activity was dependent upon addition of ATP and Mg2+ to the reaction mixtures, and hence appeared similar to the UV-endonuclease activity previously shown to be reconstituted from the same fractions. It is concluded that the uvr+ gene products in these fractions interact to cause breakage of both psoralen-treated and UV-irradiated DNA. An examination of the dose-dependence relationship of the break formation in psoralen-treated DNA revealed that the enzyme acts upon psoralen mono-adducts. By varying the experimental conditions to increase the ratio of interstrand cross-links to mono-adducts it was found that the enzyme also acts upon cross-links, but with lower efficiency than for mono-adducts. Further studies of break formation in UV-irradiated DNA showed that elimination of pyrimidine dimers by treatment with photoreactivating enzyme in the light resulted in a loss of endonuclease-sensitive sites. This shows directly that pyrimidine dimers are the lesions recognized by the complemented uvr+ gene products in UV-irradiated DNA. For comparison, another endonuclease acting at pyrimidine dimers in DNA, the Micrococcus luteus UV-endonuclease, was also tested with psoralen-treated DNA, but no activity was observed. This and other data indicate that the repair endonuclease encoded by the uvr+ genes in E. coli is basically different from the other dimer-specific endonucleases previously characterized.
TI  - Release of 7-methylguanine residues from alkylated DNA by extracts of Micrococcus luteus and Escherichia coli.
AB  - Cell extracts from Micrococcus luteus release both free 3-methyladenine and free  7-methylguanine from alkylated DNA. The glycosylase activity responsible for the liberation of 7-methylguanine is not 3-methyladenine-DNA glycosylase, which, when purified, does not liberate it. Furthermore, the heat inactivation rates of the two enzymatic activities are different. The release of 7-methylguanine by chemical depurination of ethanol-soluble oligonucleotides has been ruled out. A similar activity releasing 7-methylguanine is also found in Escherichia coli.
TI  - Comparison of the cleavage of pyrimidine dimers by the bacteriophage T4 and Micrococcus luteus UV-specific endonucleases.
AB  - A comparison was made of the activity of the UV-specific endonucleases of bacteriophage T4 (T4 endonuclease V) and of Micrococcus luteus on ultravilet light-irradiated DNA substrates of defined sequence. The two enzymes cleave DNA at the site of pyrimidine dimers with the same frequency. The products of the cleavage reaction are the same, suggesting that the scission of DNA by T4 endonuclease V occurs via the combined actin of a pyrimidine dimer specific DNA glycosylase and an apyrimidinic-apurinic (AP) endonuclease as was recently shown for the M. luteus enzyme. The pyrimidine dimer DNA-glycosylase activity of both enzymes is more active on double-stranded DNA than it is on single-stranded DNA.
TI  - [Cefoperazone concentration in infected tissues and clinical effect for patients  with peritonitis (author's transl)].
AB  - A new antibiotic drug of cephalosporin, with marked resistance to beta-lactamase, cefoperazone (CPZ) for parenteral use was used in 6 patients with acute peritonitis and perforated appendicitis. CPZ in a dose of 1 g was given intravenously during the operation. Tissue specimens of different sites were taken from removed organs. The materials of purulent ascites and appendix were subsequently taken at intervals. Determination of CPZ concentration was performed according to paper disk bioassay with Micrococcus luteus ATCC 9341 strain. CPZ concentration in purulent ascites increased quickly after injection, and reached high level peak at 30 minutes to 1 hour, then they were very slowly declined. CPZ concentration in the infected appendix, was directly proportional to the degree of pathological changes of inflammation. CPZ concentration in serious gangrenous appendix reached to 50.3 mcg/g at 20 minutes after intravenous injection, and increased to 54.3 mcg/g at 30 minutes, 60.3 mcg/g at 38 minutes, respectively. On the CPZ concentration in patients with appendicitis, the concentration in purulent ascites and appendix were observed higher than the MIC of CPZ for Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae bacilli. CPZ therefore will be a very useful drug when used for chemotherapy of acute peritonitis.
TI  - [Studies on cefoperazone concentration in human biliary tract and clinical effect for acute cholecystitis and cholangitis (author's transl)].
AB  - A new antibiotic drug of cephalosporin, with marked resistance to beta-lactamase, cefoperazone (CPZ) for parenteral use was used in 10 patients with acute cholecystitis or cholangitis with cholelithiasis. CPZ was given by drip intravenous injection at a daily dose of 1 to 4 g. Clinical response was excellent in 1 case, good in 7 cases, fair in 2 cases and poor was none. Clinical adverse effect was not recognized. And CPZ in a dose of 1 g was given intravenously during the operation to 6 of those patients. Tissue specimens of different sites were taken from removed organs. The materials of A-bile and B-bile were subsequently taken at intervals. Determination of CPZ concentration was performed according to paper disk method with Micrococcus luteus ATCC 9341 strain. CPZ concentrations in the A-bile increased quickly soon after injection, and reached high level peak at 30-min. to 1 hour, then they were very slow decline. CPZ was observed in the B-bile through the gallbladder wall, and reached high level concentration comparative quickly after intravenous injection. CPZ concentration in the gallbladder wall, was directly proportional to the degree of pathological changes of inflammation. On the CPZ concentration in patients with acute cholecystitis, the concentration in A-bile, B-bile and gallbladder wall were observed extremely higher than the MIC or CPZ for Escherichia coli. CPZ therefore will be a very useful drug when used for chemotherapy of biliary tract infection.
TI  - E. coli and M. luteus DNA topoisomerase I can catalyze catenation of decatenation of double-stranded DNA rings.
AB  - Escherichia coli and Micrococcus luteus DNA topoisomerase I are found to promote  catenation of double-stranded DNA rings. At low DNA concentration dimeric catenanes are the major catenated products; at high DNA concentration or when spermidine is present, catenanes containing more than two rings are formed. There is no requirement of extensive sequence homology between the conponent rings forming a catenane; dimeric catenanes between Pseudomonas phage PM2 DNA and E. coli plasmid pBR322 are readily formed. The formation of a dimeric catenane by these type I topoisomerases, however, requires the presence of at least one preexisting single-chain scission in one of the two component rings. This is in contrast to the cases with the type II DNA topoisomerases which can form catenanes made of covalently closed rings only. The catenanes formed by the type I enzymes can be unlinked by the same enzymes, or by DNA gyrase, a type II enzyme, upon dilution of the isolated catenanes. The catenation and decatenation of duplex DNA rings adds a fourth type of reaction promoted by these type I DNA topoisomerases to the three reported previously: relaxation of superhelical DNA, interconversion between single-stranded DNA rings with and without knots and the intertwining of single-stranded DNA rings of complementary sequences into a covalently closed duplex ring with a high linking number. All four topoisomerization reactions involve the crossing of one DNA strand through a transient break of another DNA strand. The new reaction reported here suggests that such a crossover event might not require pairing of complementary nucleotide sequences.
TI  - [Structural organization of the bacterial nucleoid using endonucleolysis].
AB  - The fragmentation of bacterial deoxyribonucleoprotein (bDNP) in the spheroplasts  of Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas fluorescens and Micrococcus luteus by bacterial intracellular Ca2+ or Ca2+, Mg2+-dependent endonucleases in situ was studied. An electrophoresis of the extracted nuclease-split bDNP revealed the presence of high molecular weight (nuclease-resistant) and low molecular weight multiple fragments (100--120 nucleotide pairs). The electrophoretic mobility of the smallest nuclease-split DNA fragments in all bacterial species under study was similar, indicating the orderly structure of bDNP. Two total fractions whose electrophoretic mobility corresponded to that of the histones H2a and H2b from calf thymus were prevalent in the spectrum of acid-soluble bDNP proteins of gram-negative species. The heterogeneity of DNP with respect to its sensitivity to nucleases, is interaction with membranes and protein distribution pattern were revealed by treatment of the bacterial nucleoid with endogenous endonucleases, which probably reflects differences in the functional state of individual sites of the genome.
TI  - The DNA polymerase beta reaction with ultraviolet-irradiated DNA incised by correndonuclease.
AB  - Covalently closed circular Col E1 DNA was ultraviolet-irradiated with a dose of 60 J/m2, thus introducing about 3.2 pyrimidine dimers per DNA molecule. Treatment of irradiated Col E1 DNA with Micrococcus luteus correndonuclease resulted, in the vicinity of pyrimidine dimers, in an average of 3.3 incisions per DNA molecule, and converted DNA to the open circular form. Incised Col E1 DNA stimulated no reaction with calf thymus DNA polymerase alpha but was recognized as a template by DNA polymerase beta. The latter enzyme incorporated about 1.6 molecules of dTMP (corresponding to 6 molecules od dNMP) per one correndonuclease incision. The length of the DNA polymerase beta product was comparable to the anticipated length of the DNA region within which the hydrogen bonds were disrupted owing to dimer formation. The enzyme required Mg(2)=nd four dNTPs for reaction and was resistant to N-ethylmaleimide or p-mercuribenzoate. The average numbers of deoxynucleotides incorporated per one DNAase I incision or per one nonspecific break, measured in control samples, were equal, amounting to 0.3 dTMP molecule. This value corresponded to 1.2 dNMP molecule; in our opinion, this reflects contaminating nuclease activity of the system used. The present results testify to the ability of DNA polymerase beta to repair synthesis by the "patch and cut' mechanism.
TI  - den V gene of bacteriophage T4 determines a DNA glycosylase specific for pyrimidine dimers in DNA.
AB  - Endonuclease V of bacteriophage T4 has been described as an enzyme, coded for by  the denV gene, that incises UV-irradiated DNA. It has recently been proposed that incision of irradiated DNA by this enzyme and the analogous "correndonucleases" I and II of Micrococcus luteus requires the sequential action of a pyrimidine dimer-specific DNA glycosylase and an apyrimidinic/apurinic endonuclease. In support of this two-step mechanism, we found that our preparations of T4 endonuclease V contained a DNA glycosylase activity that produced alkali-labile sites in irradiated DNA and an apyrimidinic/apurinic endonuclease activity that converted these sites to nicks. Both activities could be detected in the presence of 10 mM EDTA. In experiments designed to determine which of the activities is coded by the denV gene, we found that the glycosylase was more heat labile in extracts of Escherichia coli infected with either of two thermosensitive denV mutants than in extracts of cells infected with wild-type T4. In contrast, apyrimidinic/apurinic endonuclease activity was no more heat labile in extracts of the former than in extracts of the latter. Our results indicate that the denV gene codes for a DNA glycosylase specific for pyrimidine dimers.
TI  - Evolutionary relationship between Halobacterium cutirubrum and eukaryotes determined by use of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases as phylogenetic probes.
AB  - The cross-species reactivities between tRNAs and aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases have  been employed as a basis to estimate the relatedness of various prokaryotes to the eukaryotes. The tRNA of Halobacterium cutirubrum, unlike that of other prokaryotes tested, including Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Arthrobacter luteus, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus stearothermophilus, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, Myxococcus xanthus, Rhodopseudomonas spheroides, and Thermus aquaticus, was found to share with yeast, rat liver, and wheat germ tRNA a distinct preference for aminoacylation by eukaryotic synthetases from yeast as opposed to prokaryotic synthetases from either E. coli or R. spheroides. These results suggest that phylogenetically H. cutirubrum is more closely related to the eukaryotes than to the eubacteria.
TI  - Bacillus subtilis deoxyribonucleic acid gyrase.
AB  - Bacillus subtilis 168 was shown to contain a deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) gyrase activity which closely resembled those of the enzymes isolated from Escherichia coli and Micrococcus luteus in its enzymatic requirements, substrate specificity, and sensitivity to several antibiotics. The enzyme was purified from the wild type and nalidixic acid-resistant and novobiocin-resistant mutants of B. subtilis and was functionally characterized in vitro. The genetic loci nalA and novA but not novB were shown to code for portions of the functional gyrase. Enzyme from the antibiotic-resistant mutants was resistant to the drug in vitro. The most striking observation was the remarkable similarity between the B. subtilis enzyme and other DNA gyrases, especially with respect to the oxolinic acid-induced DNA cleavage in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. All of the enzymes appeared to possess the same specificity of cutting sites regardless of the source or type of DNA used. This result implies that gyrase binding to DNA is highly specific.
TI  - Properties of an endonuclease activity in Micrococcus luteus acting on gamma-irradiated DNA and on apurinic DNA.
AB  - A protein fraction from Micrococcus luteus with endonuclease activity against gamma-irradiated DNA was isolated and characterized. An additional activity on apurinic sites could not be separated, either by sucrose gradient sedimentation or by gel filtration through Sephadex G 100. From gel filtration, a molecular weight of about 25 000 was calculated for both endonuclease activities. The endonuclease activity against gamma-irradiated DNA was stimulated five-fold with 5 mM Mg++, whereas that against apurinic sites was less dependent on the Mg++ concentration. 100 mM KCl inhibited the gamma-ray endonuclease, but not the apurinic endonuclease activity. In gamma-irradiated RNA the protein recognized 1.65 endonuclease sensitive sites per radiation induced single-strand break, among which are 0.45 alkali labile lesions in the nucleotide strand. The affinity of the enzyme for the endonuclease sensitive site was evaluated resulting in a Km-value of 73 nM.
TI  - A topoisomerase from Escherichia coli related to DNA gyrase.
AB  - We have identified a topoisomerase activity from Escherichia coli related to DNA  gyrase (topoisomerase II): we designate it topoisomerase II'. It was constructed of two subunits, which were purified separately. One is the product of the gyrA (formerly nalA) gene and is identical to subunit A of DNA gyrase. The other is a 50,000-dalton protein, which we have purified to homogeneity and call v. v may be a processed form of the much larger gyrase subunit B or may be derived from a transcript of part of the subunit B structural gene, because preliminary peptide maps of the two subunits are similar. Topoisomerase II' relaxes negatively supercoiled DNA and, uniquely among E. coli topoisomerases, relaxes positive supercoils efficiently. It is the only topoisomerase that can introduce positive supercoils; these are stoichiometric with enzyme molecules. Topoisomerase II' resembles gyrase in its sensitivity to oxolinic acid, the wrapping of DNA in an apparent positive supercoil around the enzyme, and the introduction in an aborted reaction of site-specific double-strand breaks in the DNA with concomitant covalent attachment of protein to both newly created 5' ends. Unlike DNA gyrase, topoisomerase II' has no negative supercoiling activity. Functional chimeric topoisomerases were constructed with the alpha subunit of the Micrococcus luteus gyrase and v or gyrase subunit B from E. coli. We discuss the implications of the dual of the gyrA gene product.
TI  - A method for the synthesis of oligonucleotide by single addition of 2'-O-(o-nitrobenzyl)nucleoside 5'-diphosphates using polynucleotide phosphorylase.
AB  - Two hexanucleotides A-U-G-U-G-A and C-A-A-U-U-G were synthesized from the chemically synthesized trimers C-A-A and A-U-G by addition of 2'-O-(o-nitrobenzyl)nucleoside diphosphates using polynucleotide phosphorylase isolated from either Escherichia coli or Micrococcus luteus. In each reaction the preference of the enzyme was tested. The o-nitrobenzyl group was removed after addition of the mononucleotide and the deblocked product was isolated by chromatography on DEAE-Sephadex in high yields.
TI  - Construction and mapping of recombinant plasmids used for the preparation of DNA  fragments containing the Escherichia coli lactose operator and promoter.
AB  - Three DNA restriction fragments of established sequence containing the Escherichia coli lac genetic controlling regions were cloned. In each case a recombinant plasmid was constructed which was suitable for the subsequent large scale purification of the lac fragment. A 789-base pair HindII fragment, containing the lac operator, promoter, and cyclic AMP receptor protein binding site, was ligated into the single HindII site of the amplifiable plasmid minicolicin E1 DNA (pVH51). A 203-base pair Hae III fragment containing the same genetic sites was ligated into the single Eco RI site of pVH51 which had been "filled in" by the Micrococcus luteus DNA polymerase. Thus, the lac fragment was inserted between two Eco RI sites. Plasmids containing multiple copies of this Eco RI fragment were then constructed. A 95-base pair Alu I fragment containing the lac promoter and operator was cloned similarly. Also, the 203-base pair fragment was cloned into the Eco RI site of pVH51 using a 300-base pair linker fragment (isolated by RPC-5 column chromatography) which permitted retention of its Hae III ends. Mapping studies on pVH51 DNA with a number of DNA restriction endonucleases, including Alu I, Taq I, and Hpa II, are described.
TI  - Antimicrobial effect of 4-nitrophenylhydrazones, isonicotinoylhydrazones and N-4-nitrophenylglycosylamines of D- and L-aldoses.
AB  - The antibacterial effect of 19 4-nitrophenylhydrazones, isonicotinoylhydrazones,  and N-4-nitrophenylhydrazones, of 9 mono- and 2 disaccharides was tested with Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus licheniformis and Escherichia coli.
TI  - Measurement of pyrimidine dimers in spheroplasts of Bacillus subtilis.
AB  - A method is described for making spheroplasts of Bacillus subtilis which are permeable to exogenous enzymes. Conditions are described for measuring small numbers of pyrimidine dimers in the DNA of UV-irradiated cells by use of a partially purified Micrococcus luteus extract containing an enzyme specific for pyrimidine dimers. The system will detect as few as 10-12 pyrimidine dimers per genome.
TI  - Addition of poly(adenylic acid) to RNA using polynucleotide phosphorylase: an improved method for electron microscopic visualization of RNA-DNA hybrids.
AB  - We have observed that the enzyme polynucleotide phosphorylas from M. luteus or from E. coli will polymerize adenosine (A) from adenosine diphosphate onto 3' ends of RNA molecules. For gene mapping, the poly(A)-tailed RNA is hybridized to its complementary sequence on a longer DNA strand. The position of the poly(A)tail, and thus the position of the 3' end of the RNA on the DNA strand, can then be observed by electron microscopy. Our preferred mapping technique involves the synthesis of a poly(A)-specific label by polymerization of a poly(dBrU) tail onto one or both ends of a linear duplex DNA of defined length (a restriction fragment) and hybridization of this label to the poly(A) tail. In test experiments with a plasmid containing a Drosophila DNA sequence coding for 5S rRNA genes, overall labeling efficiencies of 70--80% were achieved.
TI  - Formation of spirodilactone of 4-(2'-carboxyphenyl)-4,4-dihydroxybutyrate from 2-succinylbenzoate in cell-free extracts of Micrococcus luteus.
AB  - The enzyme mediated ATP- and, to a lesser extent, CoASH-dependent synthesis of the spirodilactone of 4-(2'-carboxyphenyl)-4,4-dihydroxybutyrate from 2-succinylbenzoate has been demonstrated in membrane-free extracts of Micrococcus luteus and Escherichia coli. The suggestion is made that the spirodilactone is the product of an aberrant reaction involving a compound that is normally an intermediate in the conversion of 2-succinylbenzoate to 1,4-dihydroxy-2-naphthoate.
TI  - Dextran sulfates as a contaminant of DNA extracted from concentrated viruses and  as an inhibitor of DNA polymerases.
AB  - Dextran sulfate is commonly used with polyethylene glycol to concentrate viruses  before extraction of their DNA. However, dextran slulfate then easily contaminated such DNA and acted as a potent inhibitor of DNA polymerases from Bacillus subtilis (III), phage PBS2, and phage T4. Dextran sulfate only weakly inhibited Micrococcus luteus and Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I preparations.
TI  - Micrococcus luteus DNA gyrase: active components and a model for its supercoiling of DNA.
AB  - Two active components alpha and beta of micrococcus luteus DNA gyrase, of peptide weights of 115,000 and 97,000, respectively, have been purified. Each individual component exhibits little DNA gyrase activity; the ATP-dependent negative supercoiling of a covalently closed circular DNA duplex is catalyzed by a combination of the two. Covalent closure by Escherichia coli ligase of a circular DNA containing single-chain scissions, when carried out in the presence of a combination of the DNA gyrase components alpha and beta, gives a positively supercoiled DNA upon removal of the bound protein molecules. ATP was not present during the ligase treatment; therefore the positive supercoiling of DNA observed is a result of the binding of gyrase molecules, presumably as multi-subunit oligomers, during the ligation step. This is in contrast to the negative supercoiling of DNA catalyzed by gyrase in the presence of ATP. A model in which negative supercoiling of DNA is achieved by ATP-modulated repetitive wrapping of the DNA around gyrase is described. The model also suggests a plausible mode of action by which translocation of a DNA along its helix axis can be actively driven by an ATPase.
TI  - Biochemical aspects of cardiac muscle differentiation.
AB  - Experiments were designed to determine whether DNA synthesis ceases in terminally differentiating cardiac muscle of the rat because the activity of the putative replicative DNA polymerase (DNA polymerase alpha) is lost or whether the activity of this enzyme is lost because DNA synthesis ceases. DNA-template availability and 3'-hydroxyl termini in nuclei and chromatin, isolated from cardiac muscle at various times during the developmental period in which DNA synthesis and the activity of DNA polymerase alpha are decreasing, were measured by using Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I, Micrococcus luteus DNA polymerase and DNA polymerase alpha under optimal conditions. Density-shift experiments with bromodeoxyuridine triphosphate and isopycnic analysis indicate that DNA chains being replicated semi-conservatively in vivo continue to be elongated in isolated nuclei by exogenous DNA polymerases. DNA template and 3'-hydroxyl termini available to exogenously added DNA polymerases do not change as cardiac muscle differentiates and the rate of DNA synthesis decreases and ceases in vivo. Template availability and 3'-hydroxyl termini are also not changed in nuclei isolated from cardiac muscle in which DNA synthesis had been inhibited by administration of isoproterenol and theophylline to newborn rats. DNA-template availability and 3'-hydroxyl termini, however, were substantially increased in nuclei and chromatin from cardiac muscle of adult rats. This increase is not due to elevated deoxyribonuclease activity in nuclei and chromatin of the adult. Electron microscopy indicates that this increase is also not due to dispersal of the chromatin or disruption of nuclear morphology. Density-shift experiments and isopycnic analysis of DNA from cardiac muscle of the adult show that it is more fragmented than DNA from cardiac-muscle cells that are, or have recently ceased, dividing. These studies indicate that DNA synthesis ceases in terminally differentiating cardiac muscle because the activity of a replicative DNA polymerase is lost, rather than the activity of this enzyme being lost because DNA synthesis ceases.
TI  - The purification and characterization of a DNA nicking-closing enzyme from Bacillus megaterium.
AB  - Although several eucaryote DNA nicking--closing (N--C) enzymes have been characterized, only the Escherichia coli enzyme has been extensively studied amongst procaryotes. The latter enzyme is distinctly different from the eucaryotic enzymes and we have therefore purified the N--C enzyme from Bacillus megaterium to determine if procaryotes form a distinctive class of N--C enzymes. The purified B. megaterium N--C enzyme has a molecular weight of 120,000, only partly relaxes negative supercoils, does not affect positive supercoils, requires Mg2+, and is inhibited by 0.2 M KCl. The enzyme is also inhibited by 1 mM nalidixic or oxolinic acids but unaffected by novobiocin. A crude N--C enzyme preparation from Micrococcus luteus shows very similar properties.
TI  - Purification and characterization of the DNA-dependent RNA polymerase and its subunit sigma from Micrococcus luteus.
AB  - DNA-dependent RNA polymerase from Micrococcus luteus can be isolated from cell extracts after removal of an excess of nucleic acids by fractionation with ammonium sulfate, followed by two consecutive gel filtrations through agarose and chromatography on cellulose phospate. Either homogeneous holoenzyme or a mixture of core and holoenzyme is obtained in this way, as is indicated by electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gels in the absence of detergent, where core enzyme migrates ahead of holoenzyme. Homogeneous core enzyme can be isolated from holoenzyme by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose. Core enzyme contains the subunits alpha, beta and beta' previously described [U.I. Lill et al., (1975) Eur. J. Biochem. 52, 411-420] in a molar ratio of 2:1:1. Holoenzyme contains an additional subunit sigma of 80 000 molecular weight (molar subunit composition alpha2 betabeta' sigma) and two relatively small polypeptides (molecular weight 14 000 and 25 000, respectively). Subunit sigma may be isolated from holoenzyme by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose at pH 6.9 in the presence of low concentrations of glycerol. The behaviour of holoenzyme during sedimentation in a glycerol gradient at low ionic strength indicates its occurrence as a dimer of the alpha2betabeta'sigma-protomer, whereas the monomeric form is preferred by core enzyme. Holoenzyme is much more active than core enzyme in RNA synthesis on bacteriophage T4DNA as template. The activity of the latter is stimulated by isolated sigma. M. luteus sigma as well as holoenzyme enhances also the activity of core enzyme fro- Escherichia coli. The formation of a hybrid between micrococcal sigma and E. coli core polymerase is also suggested by the influence of sigma on the oligomerisation of the enzyme from E. coli.
TI  - Formation of a RNA polymerase sub-assembly composed of subunit alpha from Escherichia coli and of subunit beta from Micrococcus luteus.
AB  - Functionally equivalent subunits of RNA polymerase from Micrococcus luteus and Escherichia coli differ from each other in many molecular and antigenic properties. In spite of these differences, subunit alpha from E. coli and subunit beta from M. luteus form a complex alpha2beta, when incubated together. This complex binds rifampicin tightly, which the isolated subunits do not. The hybrid complex is very similar in its properties to the complex alpha2beta formed only from E. coli or M. luteus subunits. Since the sub-assembly alpha2beta from E. coli is reported to be an obligatory intermediate in the assembly process of complete RNA polymerase, the newly described hybrid sub-assembly may function similarly as an intermediate in the formation of the hybrid form of RNA polymerase described earlier.
TI  - Micrococcus luteus correndonucleases. II. Mechanism of action of two endonucleases specific for DNA containing pyrimidine dimers.
AB  - Py pyrimidine dimers Py correndonucleases I and II from Micrococcus luteus act exclusively on thymine-thymine, cytosine-cytosine, and thymine-cytosine cyclobutyl dimers in DNA, catalyzing incision 5' to the damage and generating 3'-hydroxyl and 5'-phosphoryl termini. Both enzymes initiate excision of pyrimidine dimers in vitro by correxonucleases and DNA polymerase I. The respective incised DNAs, however, differ in their ability to act as substrate for phage T4 polynucleotide ligase or bacterial alkaline phosphatase, suggesting that each endonuclease is specific for a conformationally unique site. The possibility that their respective action generates termini which represent different degrees of single strandedness is suggested by the unequal protection by Escherichia coli binding protein from the hydrolytic action of exonuclease VII.
TI  - In vitro packaging of UV radiation-damaged DNA from bacteriophage T7.
AB  - When DNA from bacteriophage T7 is irradiated with UV light, the efficiency with which this DNA can be packaged in vitro to form viable phage particles is reduced. A comparison between irradiated DNA packaged in vitro and irradiated intact phage particles shows almost identical survival as a function of UV dose when Escherichia coli wild type or polA or uvrA mutants are used as the host. Although uvrA mutants perform less host cell reactivation, the polA strains are identical with wild type in their ability to support the growth of irradiated T7 phage or irradiated T7 DNA packaged in vitro into complete phage. An examination of in vitro repair performed by extracts of T7-infected E.coli suggests that T7 DNA polymerase may substitute for E. coli DNA polymerase I in the resynthesis step of excision repair. Also tested was the ability of a similar in vitro repair system that used extracts from uninfected cells to restore biological activity of irradiated DNA. When T7 DNA damaged by UV irradiation was treated with an endonuclease from Micrococcus luteus that is specific for pyrimidine dimers and then was incubated with an extract of uninfected E. coli capable of removing pyrimidine dimers and restoring the DNA of its original (whole genome size) molecular weight, this DNA showed a higher packaging efficiency than untreated DNA, thus demonstrating that the in vitro repair system partially restored the biological activity of UV-damaged DNA.
TI  - Purification and characterization of an omega protein from Micrococcus luteus.
AB  
TI  - Deoxyribonucleic acid repair in vitro by extracts of Escherichia coli.
AB  - Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) from bacteriophage T7 has been used to monitor the capacity of gently lysed extracts of Escherichia coli to perform repair resynthesis after ultraviolet (UV) irradiation. Purified DNA damaged by up to 100 J of UV radiation per m2 was treated with an endonuclease from Micrococcus luteus that introduces single-strand breaks in irradiated DNA. This DNA was then used as a substrate to study repair resynthesis by extracts of E. coli. It was found that incubation with the extract and exogenous nucleoside triphosphates under suitable assay conditions resulted in removal of all pyrimidine dimers and restoration of the substrate DNA to its original molecular weight. Repair resynthesis, detected as nonconservative, UV-stimulated DNA synthesis, was directly proportional tothe number of pyrimidine dimers introduced by radiation. The repair mode described here appears to require DNA polymerase I since it does no occur at the restrictive temperature in polA12 mutants, which contain a thermolabile polymerase. The addition of purified DNA polymerase I to extracts made from a polA mutant restores the ability to complete repair at the restrictive temperature.
TI  - Quantitative determination of N-acetylglucosamine residues at the non-reducing ends of peptidoglycan chains by enzymic attachment of [14C]-D-galactose.
AB  - The ability of human milk galactosyltransferase to attach D-galactose residues quantitatively to the C-4 of N-acetylglucosamine moieties at the ends of oligosaccharides has been utilized for the specific labeling and quantitative determination of the chain length of the glycan moiety of the bacterial cell wall. The average polysaccharide chain length of the soluble, uncrosslinked peptidoglycan secreted by Micrococcus luteus cells on incubation with penicillin G was studied with this technique and found to be approximately 70 hexosamines long. Furthermore, the peptidoglycan chain length of Escherichia coli sacculi of different cell shapes and dimensions was determined both in rod-shaped cells and in filaments induced by temperature shift of a division mutant or by addition of cephalexin or nalidixic acid. The average chain length found in most of these sacculi was between 70 and 100 hexosamines long. Small spherical 'mini' cells had chain lengths similar to those of the isogenic rod-like cells.
TI  - Substrate specificity of the ultraviolet-endonuclease from Micrococcus luteus. Endonucleolytic cleavage of depurinated DNA.
AB  - The ultraviolet-endonuclease isolated from Micrococcul luteus, specific for pyrimidine dimers, is able to attack not only ultraviolet-irradiated DNA (leading to 3'OH-5'PO4 single-strand breaks) but also superhelical covalently-closed circular DNA of phage lambda damaged by heating at 70 degrees C, pH 5.93. The number of endonuclease-sensitive defects in the DNA corresponds to the number of alkalilabile bonds (apurinic sites) induced by heating. Competition between ultraviolet-induced lesions and apurinic sites for ultraviolet-endonuclease is demonstrated; the affinity of the enzyme for pyrimidine dimers is about three times that for apurinic sites. Both activities of the ultraviolet-endonuclease are inactivated at 50 degrees C at the same rate. The ultraviolet-endonuclease is able to reduce the infectious activity of depurinated lambda DNA towards Ca2+-treated uvr+ and uvr A Escherichia coli cells. It is concluded that both pyrimidine dimers and apurinic sites can be recognized by one and the same enzyme (the ultraviolet-endonuclease).
TI  - Synthesis and biological activity of pyrazolo[3,4,-d]pyrimidine nucleosides and nucleotides related to tubercidin, toyocamycin, and sangivamycin.
AB  - The 6-aza analogues of toyocamycin and sangivamycin were prepared as potential cytotoxic agents. The toyocamycin analogue (4-amino-1-(beta-D-ribofuranosyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine-3-carbonitrile) could not be obtained directly from its O-acetylated precursor but was accessible via 4-amino-1-(beta-D-ribofuranosyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine-3-thiocarboxamide. The identity of the nitrile was verified by its ultraviolet, infrared, and mass spectra, and by its conversion to the corresponding 3-carboxamide and thiocarboxamide when treated with water or hydrogen sulfide, respectively. Bioassay of the synthetic compounds in comparison with 4-amino-1-(beta-D-ribofuranosyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine (6-azatubercidin) and 4-amino-2-(beta-D-ribofuranosyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine revealed that the 3-thiocarboxamido derivative was more cytotoxic to the growth of mouse fibroblasts than 6-azatubercidin, effecting killing of 3T6 cells at less than or equal to 1 mug/ml. 4-Amino-1-(beta-D-ribofuranosyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine (but not its 2-ribofuranosyl isomer) was shown to act as a substrate for adenosine deaminase from calf intestinal mucosa with an apparent Km of 125 (vs. 20 for adenosine) and the corresponding 5'-diphosphate of 6-azatubercidin was polymerized by polynucleotide phosphorylase (Micrococcus luteus) in the presence of Mn2+ to afford a homopolymer and copolymers with adenosine. The copolymers directed the binding of [3H]lysyl-tRNA to the A-site of ribosomes from Escherichia coli, but could not be used for the synthesis of polylsine in a cellfree system. The copolymer consiting of adenosine and 6-azatubercidin in a 2:1 ratio was found to form a 1:1 complex with poly(uridylic acid) at 4degreesC.
TI  - Preparation and properties of the repeating sequence polymers d(A-I-C)n-d(I-C-T)n and d(A-G-C)n-d(G-C-T)n.
AB  - The repeating sequence polymer d(A-I-C)n-d(I-C-T)n has been prepared using the chemically synthesized oligomers d(A-G-C)4 and d(C-T-G)4 and the DNA polymerase from Micrococcus luteus. The enzymatically synthesized polymer was used as template for preparation of d(A-G-C)n-d(G-C-T)n. Both deoxyribonucleotide polymers were characterized by nearest neighbor analyses, buoyant density measurements in cesium chloride and cesium sulfate, melting temperature, and circular dichroism (CD) spectra. The ribopolymers r(A-I-C)n-r(I-C-U)n and r(A-G-C)n-r(G-C-U)n were transcribed from d(A-I-C)n-d(I-C-T)n, and their CD spectra were compared with those of the respective deoxyribonucleotide polymers.
TI  - Mode of inhibition of herpes simplex virus DNA polymerase by phosphonoacetate.
AB  - Phosphonoacetate is a highly specific inhibitor of herpes simplex virus-induced DNA polymerase. Sensitivity of herpesvirus type 1 or type 2 induced DNA polymerase to the drug was similar. However, DNA polymerases from other sources such as the host cells (Wi-38), Micrococcus luteus, and hepatitis B virus were highly resistant. In addition, Escherichia coli RNA polymerase and reverse transcriptase of Rous sarcoma virus were also insensitive to the drug. Enzyme kinetic studies showed that inhibition was noncompetitive with respect to deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates. The Ki value was about 0.45 muM. The apparent Km values for dTTP, dATP, dCTP, and dGTP were 0.71, 0.75, 0.42, and 0.39 muM, respectively. The base composition of template has no profound effect on the extent of inhibition. The drug caused uncompetititve inhibition with respect to template which indicated that phosphonoacetate did not bind directly to template DNA. Results are presented which suggest that phosphonoacetate did not affect the formation of the enzyme-DNA complex but probably inhibited the elongation step of DNA polymerase reaction.
TI  - Competitive inhibition of transformation in group H Streptococcus strain Challis  by heterologous deoxyribonucleic acid.
AB  - Glucosylated deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) from phages T4 and T6 competes poorly with homologous DNA causing only a slight decrease of transformation in Group H Streptococcus strain Challis. Other types of heterologous DNAs (Micrococcus luteus, Clostridium perfringens, Escherichia coli, calf thymus and non-glucosylated phage T6 DNA), in contrast to glucosylated T4 and T6 DNAs, compete with transforming DNA to the normal, high extent. These results indicate that as in transformation of Bacillus subtilis, the presence of glucose attached to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in phage T6 DNA considerably decreases the interaction of such DNA with competent cells of the Challis strain. It also indicates that the guanine plus cytosine content of DNA is not decisive in determining its interaction with competent cells.
TI  - Physico-chemical and biological study of excision-repair of UV--irradiated phiX174 RF DNA in vitro.
AB  - We have studied excision-repair of UV-irradiated phiX174 RFI DNA in vitro with UV-specific endonuclease from Micrococcus luteus (UV-endo), DNA polymerase I from Escherichia coli and DNA ligase from phage T4 infected E. coli. Excision-repair was measured a) by physico-chemical methods, i.e. by determination of the conversion of RF I DNA into RF II DNA by UV-endo and by the subsequent conversion of RF II DNA ligase, b) by biological methods i. e. by measuring the ability of the reaction product to form phages upon incubation with spheroplasts from the appropriate strains of E. coli. Using the first method, we have shown, that more than 90% of the pyrimidine dimers can be repaired in vitro; with the latter method we have shown, that the molecules which are repaired as defined by method a) have regained full biological activity. Exonuclease III was found to be not essential for excision-repair in vitro and also did not stimulate repair. From this result we conclude that UV-endo generates 3'OH endgroups, in agreement with results obtained by Hamilton et al. (1974). The usefulness of the method presented in this paper with regard to the study of excision-repair is discussed.
TI  - Triethyl-n-hexylammonium triethyl-n-hexylboride: a new antimicrobial showing activity against Candida albicans and gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The organic salt triethyl-n-hexylammonium triethyl-n-hexylboride (N(2226)B(2226)) has biostatic effects against two gram-positive bacteria, Bacillus subtilis and Micrococcus luteus, and the yeast Candida albicans. Escherichia coli and chicken embryo fibroblasts grown in tissue culture are more refractory to this compound.
TI  - Effect of activated nitrofurans on DNA.
AB  - Enzymically activated nitrofurazone reacts with co-valently closed circular DNA (derived from Escherichia coli minicells carrying lambdadv) to give at least two kinds of damage: breaks which are detected on neutral sucrose gradients and alkali-labile lesions in DNA which are converted to breaks when the DNA is subsequently Treated with alkali. DNA, isolated from nimicells exposed to the drug, also contains lesions which are converted to breaks upon treatment with endonuclease preparations obtained from Micrococcus luteus. Minicells repaired both breaks and nuclease-susceptible lesions within 2 h but did not repair alkali labile lesions within that time. Experiments with three other nitrofurans show that there are considerable differences in the degree to which DNA is damaged by activated metabolites of various derivatives and that the potency of the compounds as mutagens and carcinogens is correlated with the amount of damage caused to minicell DNA.
TI  - Specificity of deoxyribonucleic acid transmethylase induced by bacteriophage T2.  I. Nucleotide sequences isolated from tmicrococcus luteus DNA methylated in vitro.
AB  - (Deoxyribonucleic acid from Micrococcus luteus was methylated in vitro in the presence of S-adenosyl-(14C methyl)methionine with a DNA methyltransferase purified from extracts of te. coli infected with bacteriophage T2. The labelled DNA was degraded by enzymatic and specific chemical methods and the resulting short oligonucleotides were separated and characterized. tthe analytical data permit the conclusion that the tdna transmethylase reacts specifically with N-G-A-T-C-N sequences in which it converts adenine to a 6-methyl-aminopurine residue.
TI  - Synthesis of a chemically reactive analog of the nonsense codon U-G-A. Its reaction with ribosomes of Escherichia coli.
AB  - Nitrophenylated 5'-uridylic acid could be employed as primer in a polyribonucleotide nucleotidyltransferase (Micrococcus luteus) reaction to yield 5'-nitrophenylated Pu-G-A. After reduction of the nitrophenyl moiety and subsequent bromoacetylation, a 5'-bromoacetamido-phenyl-phosphorylated U-G-A was obtained, which could be used as an affinity label for the ribosomal binding site of the nonsense codon. If freshly prepared active ribosomes were employed in the incubation mixtures, the U-G-A analog reacted exclusively with one protein, which is tentatively identified as protein S18. Exposure of ribosomes to low temperatures gave rise to a reaction of the U-G-A label with another protein, which was identified as protein S4, the ram gene product. The results of the affinity labeling experiments with the chemically reactive U-G-A derivative are very similar to that obtained with a corresponding derivative of the initiation codon A-U-G (O. Pongs and E. Lanka (1975) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 75, 1505-1509), which suggests that 70S ribosomes have one preferential codon binding site.
TI  - Interaction of wheat-germ agglutinin with bacterial cells and cell-wall polymers.
AB  - Wheat germ agglutinin was found to agglutinate cells of Escherichia coli PAT 84,  Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus H, and of S. aureus 52A5, but not cells of S. aureus 52A2. Interaction of wheat germ agglutinin with a soluble linear peptidoglycan secreted by Micrococcus luteus and with the teichoic acid of S. aureus H was demonstrated by agar gel diffusion, quantitative precipitation and inhibition of hemagglutination of trypsinized rabbit erythrocytes. No interaction could be demonstrated with the teichoic acid from a phage-resistant mutant (S. aureus 52A2) which lacks A-acetyl-D-glucosamine residues. All interactions were specifically inhibited by low concentrations of chitotriose (GlcNAcbeta1 leads to 4GlcNAcbeta1 leads to 4GlcNAc) and the bacterial cell wall tetrasaccharide, GlcNAcbeta1 leads to 4MurNAcbeta1 leads to 4GlcNAcbeta1 leads to 4MurNAc. Hemagglutination-inhibition experiments showed that the linear peptidoglycan and the teichoic acid of S. aureus H were several thousand times more potent inhibitors of wheat germ agglutinin than was N-acetyl-D-glucosamine. Comparison of the efficiency of different saccharides in inhibition of hemagglutination and precipitation of polymers by wheat germ agglutinin, strongly suggests that secondary, non-specific interactions contribute to the binding of the lectin to the polymers.
TI  - Comparative ability of RNA and DNA to prime DNA synthesis in vitro: role of sequence, sugar, and structure of template-primer.
AB  - The priming efficiency of oligo(RNA) vs. oligo(DNA) in a homopolymer template-homooligomer primer system was compared using four DNA polymerases. The templates included (dT)n, (dA)n, (dC)n, and (dI)n. Primers were the oligomers of the complementary DNA OR RNA with chain lengths of 6 to 23. The DNA polymerases used were from Micrococcus luteus, avian myeloblastosis virus (AMV), and Escherichia coli (polymerase I and polymerase III). The polymerases demonstrated a preference for the DNA primers with (dC)n, (dA)n, and (dI)n templates. However, when (dT)n was the template, all but the AMV polymerase preferred (rA)11 more than 200-fold better than (dA)12. This preference was due to the physical structure of the initiation complex. The structures of the oligo-polymer complexes were characterized by mixing curves, melting curves, and analytical bouyant density analyses. (rA)11 + (dT)n formed predominatly a duplex structure, whereas (dA)12 + (dT)n formed the three- stranded structure, (dA12-2(dT)n. The Km of the duplex with E. coli Pol III was 2.9 mugM (rA)11. The Ki of the triplex was 2.2 mugM (dA)12, indicating that Pol III could bind to the triplex but would not elongate the (dA)12 primer. The influence of structure on priming also was demonstrated with longer oligomers, (dA)23 and (rA)23, where the (dA)23 formed more duplex-like structures and primed more than the (dA)12.(dT)10 + (dA)n complexes also were shown to form triplex structures that inhibited priming. These results show that template-primer structure has more influence on priming than the sugar moiety or the sequence of the nucleic acid.
TI  - Synthesis of a chemically reactive analog of the initiation codon: its reaction with ribosomes of Escherichia coli.
AB  - Nitrophenylated 5'-adenylic acid could be employed as primer in a polyribonucleotide nucleotidyltransferase (Micrococcus luteus) reaction to yield 5'-nitrophenylated pA-U-G. After reduction and subsequent bromoacetylation, an A-U-G analog was obtained, which could be used as an affinity label for the ribosomal A-U-G-binding site(s). After incubating the A-U-G affinity label with 70S ribosomes, 30S subunits programmed for initiation-factor-dependent fMet-tRNAMetf binding were obtained. Hence, the A-U-G analog had irreversibly reacted at the ribosomal decoding site. Initiation complexes which were formed with the labeled 30S subunits were puromycin-resistant. Furthermore, GTP hydrolysis, necessary for proper accommodation of initiator tRNA at the ribosomal donorsite, did not function in these complexes. These data indicate that immobilization of A-U-G at the decoding site of the ribosome allows factor-dependent initiator tRNA binding, but impairs accommodation at the donor site. The ribosomal protein(s) to which A-U-G was covalently bound at the decoding site were identified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of urea or sarkosyl. The predominant affinity-labeled protein was found to be protein S18. Variation of the incubation conditions of the affinity-labeling reaction leads to attachment of A-U-G label to another ribosomal protein, S4, the ram gene product.
TI  - Hybridization in vitro of subunits of the DNA-dependent RNA polymerase from Escherichia coli and Micrococcus luteus.
AB  
TI  - A comparison of the effects of daunomycin and adriamycin on various DNA polymerases.
AB  - The effects of the anthracycline antiboties, daunomycin and adriamycin, on the DNA-directed activities of DNA polymerases from murine sarcoma virus, rat liver (high-molecular-weight species), Escherichia coli, and Micrococcus luteus were determined. Under all conditions tested, these compounds had greater inhibitory effect against the viral polymerase than against cellular polymerase. The inhibition of murine sarcoma virus DNA polymerase by daunomycin was competitive with respect to DNA. For viral DNA polymerase it was concluded that the inhibition was predominatly caused by the interaction of duanomycin with the primer-template DNA. Also, an appreciable reversal of the daunomycin-induced inhibition of this polymerase by an increase in Mg-2+ concentration is consistent with the conclusion derived by competition experiments. In contrast, the inhibition of both rat liver and M. luteus DNA polymerases was essentially noncompetitive with DNA. Also, bacterial enzymes wer e less sensitive to inhibition by these drugs than the virion polymerase. The strong and preferential inhibiton of viral DNA polymerase is discussed in relation to a differential sensitivity of normal as compared to tumor cells observed in some cell lines.
TI  - Ultraviolet reactivation and ultraviolet mutagenesis of infectious lambda DNA: strong inhibition by treatment of DNA in vitro with UV-endonuclease from Micrococcus luteus.
AB  - UV-endonuclease from Microcossuc luteus induces single-stranded breaks in UV-irradiated DNA of phage lambda and the average length of the fragments produced (after UV-doses to DNA of 135 and 675 erg/mm2) is equal to the average spacing between pyrimidine dimers. The plaque-forming ability of UV-irradiated lambda DNA used to infect Ca++-treated uvr A6, uvrB5 or uvrC34 recipient Escherichia coli cells (but not uve+ cells) may be significantly enhanced by treatment of lambda DNA with UV-endonuclease. This enzyme strongly decreases the reactivation of UV-irradiated lambda DNA caused by UV-irradiation of uvr+ or uvrA6 Ca++-treated cells and eliminates most clear-mutations especially if mutations are analysed using Ca++-treated uvr A6 recipient cells. It is concluded that UV-endonuclease switches a significant part of potentially mutagenic pyrimidine dimers from the UV-induced "error-prone" repair pathway to "error-free" excision repair pathway.
TI  - Deoxyribonucleic acid polymerase III of Escherichia coli. Characterization of associated exonuclease activities.
AB  - Purified DNA polymerase III has two distinct exonuclease activities: one initiates hydrolsis at the 3 termini, and the other at the 5 termini of single-stranded DNA. Both exonucleases have the same relative mobility on polyacrylamide gels as the polymerase activity. Molecular identity of the three activities is further indicated by their comparative rates of thermal inactivation and their sensitivity to ionic strength. The 3-5 exonuclease activity hydrolyzes only single-standed DNA. The rate of hydrolysis is twice the optimal rate of polymerization. The products are 5-mononucleotides, but the 3-5 activity is unable to cleave free dinucleotides or the 5-terminal dinucleotide of a polydeoxynucleotide chain. The 3-5 activity will not degrade 3-phosphoryl-terminated oligonucleotides such as d(pTpTpTp). The 5-3 activity catalyzes the hydrolysis of single-stranded DNA at 1/15 the rate of the 3-5 exonuclease. The 5-3 exonuclease requires the presence of a 5 single-stranded terminus in order to initiate hydrolysis, but will thereafter proceed into a double-stranded region. Although the limit products found during hydrolysis of substrates designed to assay specifically the 5-3 activity are predominantly mono- and dinucleotides, these products probably arise from the subsequent hydrolysis of oligonucleotides by the 3-5 hydrolytic activity. This interpretation is supported by (a) the relatively greater activity of the 3-5 exonuclease, (b) the inability of the enzyme to degrade d(pTpTpTp), and (c) the release of the 5 terminus of a single-stranded DNA molecule as an oligonucleotide. The 5-3 exonuclease attacks ultraviolet-irradiated duplex DNA which has first been incised by the Micrococcus luteus endonuclease specific for thymine dimers in DNA.
TI  - Interaction of 4,5-dibromo-2,7-di-(acetatomercuri)-fluorescein with DNAs of different base composition.
AB  - The changes in absorption spectra in the visible region observed on adding different naturally occurring and synthetic DNA duplexes to solutions of 4,5-dibromo-2,7-di-(acetatomercuri)-fluorescein indicate that the mercurial reacts with polynucleotides of this type. The reaction is reversible as proved by adding excess of KCN which restores the original spectra of the free dye. The interaction is characterised also by quenching of the fluorescence of the dye and the induction of optical activity in it. The extent of these spectral effects depends strongly on the (A+T) content of the complexed DNA and decreased in the order: poly [d(A-T)], Clostridium perfringens DAN, Escherichia coli DNA, Micrococcus luteus DNA and poly(dC). From equilibrium-dialysis experiments the same order in affinity is obtained when these poly-nucleotides are at equilibrium with the same concentration of 4,5-dibromo-2,7-di-(acetatomercuri)-fluorescein. From the changes produced by different mercurials in the ORD spectra and viscosity of a DNA solution it has been concluded that 4,5-dibromo-2,7-di(acetatomercuri)-fluorescein does not cause any drastic alteration of the secondary structure of DNA.

TI  - 'Single addition' and 'transnucleotidation' reactions catalyzed by polynucleotide phosphorylase. Effect of enzymatic removal of inorganic phosphate during reaction.
AB  - The reaction of the tetranucleotide, pA-A(2)-A, with 2'(3')-0-(alpha-methoxyethyl)uridine 5'-diphosphate, Mg(2+) ions, and M. luteus polynucleotide phosphorylase followed by mild acid treatment to remove the blocking groups results in a 49% yield of the desired single addition product, pA-A(3)-U, together with smaller amounts of pA-A-U, pA-A-A, pA-A(2)-U, pA-A(2)-A, pA-A(3)-A, pA-A(4)-U, and pA-A(4)-A. The side products are thought to arise from the phosphorolysis of the acceptor molecule by the inorganic phosphate formed in the reaction mixture and from subsequent additions to the various oligonucleotide species by the resulting adenosine 5'-diphosphate. A system developed for the removal of inorganic phosphate as it is formed in the synthesis involves the addition to the reaction mixture of calf spleen nucleoside phosphorylase and nicotinamide riboside and, under these conditions, pA-A(3)-U can be prepared in 90% yield with essentially no side products. Under similar conditions, pA-A(3)-A, pA-A(3)-G, and pA-A(3)-C may be prepared from pA-A(2)-A and the appropriate blocked nucleoside diphosphate in yields of 85-94%. The incubation of pA-A(2)-A alone with polynucleotide phosphorylase exhibits the phenomenon of "transnucleotidation" in that the molecule is partially converted to oligonucleotides of smaller and larger chain lengths. In the presence of the phosphate removal system, however, the tetranucleotide is not attacked by the enzyme, and thus, "transnucleotidation" appears to be simply a combination of phosphorolytic and addition reactions catalyzed by trace amounts of inorganic phosphate contaminating the enzyme and/or the substrate.

TI  - Isolation of circular DNA molecules from whole cellular DNA by use of ATP-dependent deoxyribonuclease.
AB  - A technique is described for isolation of plasmid DNA in closed and open circular double-stranded forms from bacterial cells, by use of ATP-dependent deoxyribonuclease purified from Micrococcus luteus. This DNase, acting only upon linear DNA molecules, degrades all bacterial chromosomal DNA extracted in the linear form. Circular plasmid DNAs are left intact, and are then separated by sedimentation through a sucrose gradient. Unlike previous techniques for analysis of plasmid DNA, this technique can be used to isolate not only closed circular DNA but also open circular DNA. Several plasmids, such as those from phage (lambdadv1 and lambdadv21), a colicinogenic factor (Col E2), a sex factor (F(8)' gal), and "minicircles" in Escherichia coli 15, in both the open and closed circular forms, were well separated from chromosomal DNA by this technique.

TI  - A DNA-binding protein in the serum of certain mammalian species.
AB  - Various mammalian species contain an anionic serum protein that reacts specifically with native DNA. It is considerably less reactive with single-strand DNA and does not react with monodeoxyribonucleotides, homopolyribonucleotides, or duplexes of homopolyribonucleotides. Synthetic dA.dT was an effective inhibitor of the reaction with native DNA, while Micrococcus luteus DNA and dG.dC were not inhibitory. This protein was encountered in the course of studies on DNA antibodies. Although it reacted with red cells coated with DNA and gave agar precipitation bands, it was clearly distinct from DNA antibodies. It was found in the serum of all animals of a given species, migrated as an alpha-beta globulin, and did not crossreact with gammaglobulins. It reacted with DNA in solution to give precipitation curves that were strongly influenced by changes in ionic strength. The protein was isolated from canine serum by precipitation with DNA and purified to homogeneity, as judged by immunochemical and electrophoretic criteria.A similar protein was found in mink, equine, and other sera, but not in human sera. Previous studies on DNA antibodies in certain experimental animals may have given false positive results due to this protein.
TI  - Endonucleolytic activity from Micrococcus luteus that acts on -ray-induced damage in plasmid DNA of Escherichia coli minicells.
AB  - A partially purified extract from Micrococcus luteus contains endonucleolytic activity toward ultraviolet (UV)-irradiated deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). We found that the same extract also acts on superhelical, covalently-closed circular lambdadv DNA isolated from gamma-irradiated minicells of E. coli. The introduction of nicks in isolated covalently-closed circular DNA by an endonuclease in the extract results in relaxed circles, and these two circular DNA species are easily distinguishable by their sedimentation properties in alkaline sucrose. The frequency with which the endonuclease-susceptible lesions are produced in superhelical DNA is only marginally enhanced when (60)Co gamma-rays are administered to an aerobic rather than an anoxic minicell suspension. The ratio of endonuclease-sensitive defects to single-strand scissions, induced by gamma-irradiation in air, is about 1:3. The nuclease-sensitive lesions disappear from gamma-irradiated minicells during incubation after radiation presumably as a consequence of excision repair. Since the addition of UV-irradiated calf-thymus DNA depresses the ability of the M. luteus extract to attack not only UV-damaged E. coli DNA (a known substrate for the so-called UV-specific endonuclease that catalyzes the initial single-strand incision adjacent to the structural defect) but, also lambdadv DNA injured by gamma-rays, we conclude that physicochemical alterations induced by both types of radiation are recognized by one and the same endonuclease.
TI  - RNA-primed DNA synthesis in vitro.
AB  - In vitro DNA synthesis on single-stranded circular DNA can be initiated by RNA primers. RNA chains are covalently extended by DNA polymerase II from KB cells and DNA polymerase I from Micrococcus luteus, but not by an RNA-dependent DNA polymerase from avian myeloblastosis virus. The reaction product consists of DNA chains with a piece of RNA at their 5'-ends, hydrogen bonded to the template DNA. The primer RNA is linked to the product DNA via a 3':5'-phosphodiester bond, and can be specifically removed by ribonuclease H. The possible role of ribonuclease H in RNA-primed DNA synthesis in vivo is discussed.

TI  - Nucleoside diphosphokinase activity associated with DNA polymerases.
AB  - Nucleoside diphosphokinase activity is present in highly purified preparations of DNA polymerase from Micrococcus luteus and Escherichia coli, and in a partially purified DNA polymerase from avian myeloblastosis virus. The activity is also observed in the protein fragment of molecular weight 76,000 that is produced by subtilisin cleavage of DNA polymerase I from E. coli. The NDP kinase activity in DNA polymerase preparations from M. luteus uses various ribo- and deoxyribonucleoside di- and triphosphates as substrates. The presence of this activity in preparations of DNA polymerase results in the apparent use of deoxyribonucleoside diphosphates as substrates for DNA synthesis, provided that some triphosphate is present to serve as a phosphate donor.
TI  - Endonuclease from Micrococcus luteus which has activity toward ultraviolet-irradiated deoxyribonucleic acid: purification and properties.
AB  - An endonuclease purified approximately 3,200-fold from Micrococcus luteus is active on native ultraviolet-irradiated deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), but is inactive on unirradiated native or denatured DNA and has no activity toward irradiated denatured DNA. The major type of lesion for the nucleolytic activity is the cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer. The enzyme makes a number of single-strand breaks approximately equal to the number of dimers, but dimers are not excised. This endonuclease-a small molecular weight protein-therefore has all the attributes hypothesized for the first enzyme in the sequential steps in repair of DNA in vivo. Another paper shows that the endonuclease is able to reactivate ultraviolet-irradiated transforming DNA.
