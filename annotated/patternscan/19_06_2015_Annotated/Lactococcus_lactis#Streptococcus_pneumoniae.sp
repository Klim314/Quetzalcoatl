TI  == a tyrosine phosphorylation switch controls the interaction between the transmembrane modulator protein wzd and the tyrosine kinase wze of lactobacillus  rhamnosus.
AB  == background: one proposed mechanism for assembly of secreted heteropolysaccharides by many gram positive bacteria relies on the coordinated action of a polymerization complex through reversible phosphorylation events. the role of the tyrosine protein kinase transmembrane modulator is, however, not well understood. results: the protein sequences deduced from the wzb, wzd and wze genes from lactobacillus rhamnosus atcc 9595 and rw-9595 m contain motifs also found in corresponding proteins cpsb, cpsc and cpsd from streptococcus pneumoniae d39 (serotype 2). use of an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody demonstrated that both wzd  and wze can be found in tyrosine phosphorylated form. when tyrosine 266 was mutated to phenylalanine, wzdy266f showed slightly less phosphorylated protein than those produced by using eight other tyrosine mutated wzd genes, when expressed along with wze and wzb in lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris mg1363. in order to demonstrate the importance of atp for the interactions among these proteins, native and fusion wzb, wzd and wze proteins were expressed and purified from escherichia coli cultures. the modulator protein, wzd, binds with the phosphotyrosine kinase wze, irrespective of its phosphorylation status. however,  wze attained a higher phosphorylation level after interacting with phosphorylated wzd in the presence of 10 mm atp. this highly phosphorylated wze did not remain in close association with phosphorylated wzd. conclusion: the wze tyrosine kinase protein of lactobacillus rhamnosus thus carries out tyrosine phosphorylation of wzd in addition to auto- and trans- phosphorylation of the kinase itself.

TI  == optimization of fluorescent tools for cell biology studies in gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == the understanding of how gram-positive bacteria divide and ensure the correct localization of different molecular machineries, such as those involved in the synthesis of the bacterial cell surface, is crucial to design strategies to fight bacterial infections. in order to determine the correct subcellular localization  of fluorescent proteins in streptococcus pneumoniae, we have previously described tools to express derivatives of four fluorescent proteins, mcherry, citrine, cfp  and gfp, to levels that allow visualization by fluorescence microscopy, by fusing the first ten amino acids of the s. pneumoniae protein wze (the i-tag), upstream  of the fluorescent protein. here, we report that these tools can also be used in  other gram-positive bacteria, namely lactococcus lactis, staphylococcus aureus and bacillus subtilis, possibly due to optimized translation rates. additionally, we have optimized the i-tag by testing the effect of the first ten amino acids of other pneumococcal proteins in the increased expression of the fluorescent protein citrine. we found that manipulating the structure and stability of the 5' end of the mrna molecule, which may influence the accessibility of the ribosome,  is determinant to ensure the expression of a strong fluorescent signal.

TI  == endocytosis of streptococcus pneumoniae via the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor of epithelial cells relies on clathrin and caveolin dependent mechanisms.
AB  == colonization of streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococci) is a prerequisite for bacterial dissemination and their capability to enter the bloodstream. pneumococci have evolved various successful strategies to colonize the mucosal epithelial barrier of humans. a pivotal mechanism of host cell invasion implicated with invasive diseases is promoted by the interaction of pneumococcal  pspc with the polymeric ig-receptor (pigr). however, the mechanism(s) of pneumococcal endocytosis and the intracellular route of pneumococci upon uptake by the pspc-pigr-interaction are not known. here, we demonstrate by using a combination of pharmacological inhibitors and genetics interference approaches the involvement of active dynamin-dependent caveolae and clathrin-coated vesicles for pneumococcal uptake via the pspc-pigr mechanism. depleting cholesterol from host cell membranes and disruption of lipid microdomains impaired pneumococcal internalization. moreover, chemical inhibition of clathrin or functional inactivation of dynamin, caveolae or clathrin by rna interference significantly affected pneumococcal internalization suggesting that clathrin-mediated endocytosis (cme) and caveolae are involved in the bacterial uptake process. confocal fluorescence microscopy of pigr-expressing epithelial cells infected with pneumococci or heterologous lactococcus lactis expressing pspc demonstrated  bacterial co-localization with fluorescent-tagged clathrin and early as well as recycling or late endosomal markers such as lamp1, rab5, rab4, and rab7, respectively. in conclusion these data suggest that pspc-promoted uptake is mediated by both cme and caveolae. after endocytosis pneumococci are routed via the endocytic pathway into early endosomes and are then sorted into recycling or  late endosomes, which can result in pneumococcal killing in phagolysosomes or transcytosis via recycling endosomes.

TI  == binding of vitronectin and factor h to hic contributes to immune evasion of streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 3.
AB  == streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 3 strains are highly resistant to opsonophagocytosis due to recruitment of the complement inhibitor factor h via hic, a member of the pneumococcal surface protein c (pspc) family. in this study, we demonstrated that hic also interacts with vitronectin, a fluid-phase regulator involved in haemostasis, angiogenesis, and the terminal complement cascade as well as a component of the extracellular matrix. blocking of hic by specific antiserum or genetic deletion significantly reduced pneumococcal binding to soluble and immobilised vitronectin and to factor h, respectively. in parallel, ectopic expression of hic on the surface of lactococcus lactis conferred binding  to soluble and immobilised vitronectin as well as factor h. molecular analyses with truncated hic fragments narrowed down the vitronectin-binding site to the central core of hic (aa 151-201). this vitronectin-binding region is separate from that of factor h, which binds to the n-terminus of hic (aa 38-92). binding of pneumococcal hic was localised to the c-terminal heparin-binding domain (hbd3) of vitronectin. however, an n-terminal region to hbd3 was further involved in hic-binding to immobilised vitronectin. finally, vitronectin bound to hic was functionally active and inhibited formation of the terminal complement complex. in conclusion, hic interacts with vitronectin and simultaneously with factor h, and both human proteins may contribute to colonisation and invasive disease caused by serotype 3 pneumococci.

TI  == sensitivity to the two-peptide bacteriocin lactococcin g is dependent on uppp, an enzyme involved in cell-wall synthesis.
AB  == most bacterially produced antimicrobial peptides (bacteriocins) are thought to kill target cells by a receptor-mediated mechanism. however, for most bacteriocins the receptor is unknown. for instance, no target receptor has been identified for the two-peptide bacteriocins (class iib), whose activity requires  the combined action of two individual peptides. to identify the receptor for the  class iib bacteriocin lactococcin g, which targets strains of lactococcus lactis, we generated 12 lactococcin g-resistant mutants and performed whole-genome sequencing to identify mutations causing the resistant phenotype. remarkably, all had a mutation in or near the gene uppp (baca), encoding an undecaprenyl pyrophosphate phosphatase; a membrane protein involved in peptidoglycan synthesis. nine mutants had stop codons or frameshifts in the uppp gene, two had  point mutations in putative regulatory regions and one caused an amino acid substitution in uppp. to verify the receptor function of uppp, it was shown that  growth of non-sensitive streptococcus pneumoniae could be inhibited by lactococcin g when l. lactis uppp was expressed in this bacterium. furthermore, we show that the related class iib bacteriocin enterocin 1071 also uses uppp as receptor. the approach used here should be broadly applicable to identify receptors for other bacteriocins as well.

TI  == functional diversity of tandem substrate-binding domains in abc transporters from pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == the atp-binding cassette (abc) transporter glnpq is an essential uptake system for amino acids in gram-positive pathogens and related nonpathogenic bacteria. the transporter has tandem substrate-binding domains (sbds) fused to each transmembrane domain, giving rise to four sbds per functional transporter complex. we have determined the crystal structures and ligand-binding properties  of the sbds of glnpq from enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, and lactococcus lactis. the tandem sbds differ in substrate specificity and affinity, allowing cells to efficiently accumulate different amino acids via a single abc transporter. the combined structural, functional, and thermodynamic analysis revealed the roles of individual residues in determining the substrate affinity.  we succeeded in converting a low-affinity sbd into a high-affinity receptor and vice versa. our data indicate that a small number of residues that reside in the  binding pocket constitute the major affinity determinants of the sbds.

TI  == benchmarking various green fluorescent protein variants in bacillus subtilis, streptococcus pneumoniae, and lactococcus lactis for live cell imaging.
AB  == green fluorescent protein (gfp) offers efficient ways of visualizing promoter activity and protein localization in vivo, and many different variants are currently available to study bacterial cell biology. which of these variants is best suited for a certain bacterial strain, goal, or experimental condition is not clear. here, we have designed and constructed two "superfolder" gfps with codon adaptation specifically for bacillus subtilis and streptococcus pneumoniae  and have benchmarked them against five other previously available variants of gfp in b. subtilis, s. pneumoniae, and lactococcus lactis, using promoter-gfp fusions. surprisingly, the best-performing gfp under our experimental conditions  in b. subtilis was the one codon optimized for s. pneumoniae and vice versa. the  data and tools described in this study will be useful for cell biology studies in low-gc-rich gram-positive bacteria.

TI  == stimulation of cadaverine production by foodborne pathogens in the presence of lactobacillus, lactococcus, and streptococcus spp.
AB  == the effect of lactobacillus plantarum (fi8595), lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris mg 1363), lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (il 1403), and streptococcus  thermophilus on cadaverine and other biogenic amine production by foodborne pathogens was investigated lysine decarboxylase broth. both of lactic acid bacteria and foodborne pathogens used (especially staphylococcus aureus, e. coli, lc. lactis subsp. lactis and lb. plantarum) had an ability to convert aminoacids  into biogenic amine. the conversion of lysine into cadaverine was the highest (167.11 mg/l) by lactobacillus spp. gram-positive bacteria generally had a greater ability to produce cadaverine with corresponding value of 46.26, 53.76, and 154.54 mg/l for enterococcus faecalis, s. aureus, and listeria monocytogenes, respectively. significant variations on biogenic amine production were observed in the presence of lactic acid bacteria strains (p < 0.05). the role of lactic acid bacteria on biogenic amine production by foodborne pathogens varied depending on strains and specific amine. cadaverine accumulation by enterobactericeae was increased in the presence of lactic acid bacteria strains except for st. thermophilus, which induced 2-fold lower cadaverine production by  s. paratyphi a. lc. lactis subsp. lactis and lc. lactis subsp. cremoris induced 10-fold higher increases in histamine for e. coli and k. pneumoniae, respectively. lactic acid bacteria resulted in strong increases in cadaverine production by p. aeruginosa, although remarkable decreases were observed for histamine, spermidine, dopamine, agmatine, and tma in the presence of lactic acid bacteria in lysine decarboxylase broth . the result of the study showed that amine positive lactic acid bacteria strains in fermented food led to significant  amine accumulation by contaminant bacteria and their accumulation in food product may be controlled by the use of proper starters with amine-negative activity.

TI  == pneumococcal neuraminidase a: an essential upper airway colonization factor for streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == streptococcus pneumoniae colonizes the upper respiratory tract from where the organisms may disseminate systemically to cause life threatening infections. the  mechanisms by which pneumococci colonize epithelia are not understood, but neuraminidase a (nana) has a major role in promoting growth and survival in the upper respiratory tract. in this article we show that mutants of s. pneumoniae d39 deficient in nana or neuraminidase b (nanb) are abrogated in adherence to three epithelial cell lines, and to primary nasopharyngeal cells. adherence levels were partly restored by nana complementation in trans. enzymic activity of nana was shown to be necessary for pneumococcal adherence to epithelial cells, and adherence of the nana mutant was restored to wild-type level by pre-incubation of epithelial cells with lactococcus lactis cells expressing nana. pneumococcal nana or nanb mutants were deficient in biofilm formation, while expression of nana on l. lactis or streptococcus gordonii promoted biofilm formation by these heterologous host organisms. the results suggest that nana is  an enzymic factor mediating adherence to epithelial cells by decrypting receptors for adhesion, and functions at least in part as an adhesin in biofilm formation.  neuraminidase a thus appears to play multiple temporal roles in pneumococcal infection, from adherence to host tissues, colonization, and community development, to systemic spread and crossing of the blood-brain barrier.

TI  == heterologous expression of pneumococcal virulence factor pspc on the surface of lactococcus lactis confers adhesive properties.
AB  == lactococcus lactis is a non-pathogenic bacterium that is used in the food industry but is also used as a heterologous host to reveal protein functions of pathogenic bacteria. the adhesin pspc from streptococcus pneumoniae is a choline-binding protein that is non-covalently anchored to the bacterial cell wall. to assess the exclusive impact of pneumococcal surface protein c (pspc) on  the interplay with its host we generated recombinant l. lactis producing a nisin-inducible and covalently anchored variant of pspc on the lactococcal cell surface. a translational fusion of the 5'-end of pspc3.4 with the 3'-end of hic (pspc11.4) was designed to decorate the surface of l. lactis with a chimeric pspc. the pspc3.4 part comprises the first 281 aa residues of pspc3.4, while the  hic sequence consists of the proline-rich and sortase-anchored domain. the results demonstrated that pspc is sufficient for adhesion and subsequent invasion of host epithelial cells expressing the human polymeric ig receptor (hpigr). moreover, invasion via hpigr was even more pronounced when the chimeric pspc was  produced by lactococci compared with pneumococci. this study shows also for the first time that pspc plays no significant role during phagocytosis by macrophages. in contrast, recruitment of factor h via the pspc chimer has a dramatic effect on phagocytosis of recombinant but not wild-type lactococci, as factor h interacts specifically with the amino-terminal part of pspc and mediates the contact with phagocytes. furthermore, l. lactis expressing pspc increased intracellular calcium levels in pigr-expressing epithelial cells, thus resembling the effect of pneumococci, which induced release of ca(2+) from intracellular stores via the pspc-pigr mechanism. in conclusion, expression of the chimeric pspc confers adhesive properties to l. lactis and indicates the potential of l. lactis as a suitable host to study the impact of individual bacterial factors on  their capacity to interfere with the host and manipulate eukaryotic epithelial cells.

TI  == from meadows to milk to mucosa - adaptation of streptococcus and lactococcus species to their nutritional environments.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) are indigenous to food-related habitats as well as associated with the mucosal surfaces of animals. the lab family streptococcaceae  consists of the genera lactococcus and streptococcus. members of the family include the industrially important species lactococcus lactis, which has a long history safe use in the fermentative food industry, and the disease-causing streptococci streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes. the central metabolic pathways of the streptococcaceae family have been extensively studied because of their relevance in the industrial use of some species, as well as their influence on virulence of others. recent developments in high-throughput proteomic and dna-microarray techniques, in in vivo nmr studies, and importantly  in whole-genome sequencing have resulted in new insights into the metabolism of the streptococcaceae family. the development of cost-effective high-throughput sequencing has resulted in the publication of numerous whole-genome sequences of  lactococcal and streptococcal species. comparative genomic analysis of these closely related but environmentally diverse species provides insight into the evolution of this family of lab and shows that the relatively small genomes of members of the streptococcaceae family have been largely shaped by the nutritionally rich environments they inhabit.

TI  == lactococcus lactis as an adjuvant and delivery vehicle of antigens against pneumococcal respiratory infections.
AB  == most studies of lactococcus lactis as delivery vehicles of pneumococcal antigens  are focused on the effectiveness of mucosal recombinant vaccines against streptococcus pneumoniae in animal models. at present, there are three types of pneumococcal vaccines: capsular polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccines (ppv), protein-polysaccharide conjugate pneumococcal vaccines (pcv) and protein-based pneumococcal vaccines (pbpv). only ppv and pcv have been licensed. these vaccines, however, do not represent a definitive solution. novel, safe and inexpensive vaccines are necessary, especially in developing countries. probiotic microorganisms such as lactic acid bacteria (lab) are an interesting alternative  for their use as vehicles in pneumococcal vaccines due to their gras (generally recognized as safe) status. thus, the adjuvanticity of lactococcus lactis by itself represents added value over the use of other bacteria, a question dealt with in this review. in addition, the expression of different pneumococcal antigens as well as the use of oral and nasal mucosal routes of administration of lactococcal vaccines is considered. the advantages of nasal live vaccines are evident; nonetheless, oral vaccines can be a good alternative when the adequate dose is used. another point addressed here is the use of live versus inactivated  vaccines. in this sense, few researchers have focused on inactivated strains to be used as vaccines against pneumoccoccus. the immunogenicity of live vaccines is better than the one afforded by inactivated ones; however, the probiotic-inactivated vaccine combination has improved this matter considerably.  the progress made so far in the protective immune response induced by recombinant vaccines, the successful trials in animal models and the safety considerations of their application in humans suggest that the use of recombinant vaccines represents a good short-term option in the control of pneumococcal diseases.

TI  == resistance of young mice to pneumococcal infection can be improved by oral vaccination with recombinant lactococcus lactis.
AB  == background/purpose: oral immunization with lactococcus lactis pppa (lpa+), a recombinant strain that is able to express the pneumococcal protective protein a, can improve the resistance to respiratory challenge with streptococcus pneumoniae in adult mice. in this study, we investigated whether oral immunization protocols using lpa+ are able to protect young mice against pneumococcal respiratory infection. methods: young mice (aged, 3 weeks) were immunized orally with lpa+ for 5 consecutive days. vaccination was performed once (non-boosted group), or twice with a 2-week interval between each immunization (boosted group). at the end of treatment, the specific immune responses and the resistance to pneumococcal infection were studied. results: we found that the oral immunization with lpa+ was able to induce the production of specific antibodies in the respiratory and intestinal tracts as well as systemically. analysis of igg subtypes showed that lpa+ immunization stimulated a mixed th1 and th2 response. to assess whether the production of mucosal and systemic antibodies was able to afford protection against respiratory pneumococcal infection, challenge experiments with the pathogenic serotypes 3, 6b, 14, and 23f were carried out. vaccination with lpa+ was able to increase resistance to infection with the four  serotypes of s. pneumoniae, although the protective capacity of the experimental  vaccine was different for each of them. immunization decreased colonization in the lung, prevented bacteremia of serotypes 6b, 14, and 23f, and decreased colony counts of serotype 3. conclusion: we have shown that the oral immunization of young mice with lpa+ effectively induces the production of specific antibodies against the antigen pppa, both in mucosae and at the systemic level. the antibodies produced may play an important role in the protection against pneumococcal disease, since the young mice immunized with the experimental vaccine showed an increased resistance to infection with different serotypes of the pathogen.

AB  == background: lactococcus garvieae is a bacterial pathogen that affects different animal species in addition to humans. despite the widespread distribution and emerging clinical significance of l. garvieae in both veterinary and human medicine, there is almost a complete lack of knowledge about the genetic content  of this microorganism. in the present study, the genomic content of l. garvieae cect 4531 was analysed using bioinformatics tools and microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization (cgh) experiments. lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis il1403 and streptococcus pneumoniae tigr4 were used as reference microorganisms. results: the combination and integration of in silico analyses and in vitro cgh experiments, performed in comparison with the reference microorganisms, allowed establishment of an inter-species hybridization framework with a detection threshold based on a sequence similarity of >or= 70%. with this  threshold value, 267 genes were identified as having an analogue in l. garvieae,  most of which (n = 258) have been documented for the first time in this pathogen. most of the genes are related to ribosomal, sugar metabolism or energy conversion systems. some of the identified genes, such as als and myca, could be involved in the pathogenesis of l. garvieae infections. conclusions: in this study, we identified 267 genes that were potentially present in l. garvieae cect 4531. some of the identified genes could be involved in the pathogenesis of l. garvieae infections. these results provide the first insight into the genome content of l. garvieae.

TI  == production of a class ii two-component lantibiotic of streptococcus pneumoniae using the class i nisin synthetic machinery and leader sequence.
AB  == recent studies showed that the nisin modification machinery can successfully dehydrate serines and threonines and introduce lanthionine rings in small peptides that are fused to the nisin leader sequence. this opens up exciting possibilities to produce and engineer larger antimicrobial peptides in vivo. here we demonstrate the exploitation of the class i nisin production machinery to generate, modify, and secrete biologically active, previously not-yet-isolated and -characterized class ii two-component lantibiotics that have no sequence homology to nisin. the nisin synthesis machinery, composed of the modification enzymes nisb and nisc and the transporter nist, was used to modify and secrete a  putative two-component lantibiotic of streptococcus pneumoniae. this was achieved by genetically fusing the propeptide-encoding sequences of the spr1765 (pnea1) and spr1766 (pnea2) genes to the nisin leader-encoding sequence. the chimeric prepeptides were secreted out of lactococcus lactis, purified by cation exchange  fast protein liquid chromatography, and further characterized. mass spectrometry  analyses demonstrated the presence and partial localization of multiple dehydrated serines and/or threonines and (methyl)lanthionines in both peptides. moreover, after cleavage of the leader peptide from the prepeptides, both modified propeptides displayed antimicrobial activity against micrococcus flavus. these results demonstrate that the nisin synthetase machinery can be successfully used to modify and produce otherwise difficult to obtain antimicrobially active lantibiotics.

TI  == administration of a probiotic associated with nasal vaccination with inactivated  lactococcus lactis-pppa induces effective protection against pneumoccocal infection in young mice.
AB  == streptococcus pneumoniae is a serious public health problem, especially in developing countries, where available vaccines are not part of the vaccination calendar. we evaluated different respiratory mucosa immunization protocols that included the nasal administration of lactococcus lactis-pneumococcal protective protein a (pppa) live, inactivated, and in association with a probiotic (lc) to young mice. the animals that received lc by the oral and nasal route presented the highest levels of immunoglobulin (ig)a and igg anti-pppa antibodies in bronchoalveolar lavages (bal) and igg in serum, which no doubt contributed to the protection against infection. however, only the groups that received the live and inactivated vaccine associated with the oral administration of the probiotic were able to prevent lung colonization by s. pneumoniae serotypes 3 and 14 in a respiratory infection model. this would be related to a preferential stimulation  of the t helper type 1 (th1) cells at local and systemic levels and with a moderate th2 and th17 response, shown by the cytokine profile induced in bal and  by the results of the igg1/igg2a ratio at local and systemic levels. nasal immunization with the inactivated recombinant strain associated with oral lc administration was able to stimulate the specific cellular and humoral immune response and afford protection against the challenge with the two s. pneumoniae serotypes. the results obtained show the probiotic-inactivated vaccine association as a valuable alternative for application to human health, especially in at-risk populations, and are the first report of a safe and effective immunization strategy using an inactivated recombinant strain.

TI  == phosphoproteomic analysis reveals the multiple roles of phosphorylation in pathogenic bacterium streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == recent phosphoproteomic characterizations of bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli, lactococcus lactis, pseudomonas putida, and pseudomonas aeruginosa have suggested that protein phosphorylation on serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues is a major regulatory post-translational modification in bacteria. in this study, we carried out a global and site-specific phosphoproteomic analysis on the gram-positive pathogenic bacterium streptococcus pneumoniae. one hundred and two  unique phosphopeptides and 163 phosphorylation sites with distributions of 47%/44%/9% for ser/thr/tyr phosphorylations from 84 s. pneumoniae proteins were identified through the combined use of tio(2) enrichment and lc-ms/ms determination. the identified phosphoproteins were found to be involved in various biological processes including carbon/protein/nucleotide metabolisms, cell cycle and division regulation. a striking characteristic of s. pneumoniae phosphoproteome is the large number of multiple species-specific phosphorylated sites, indicating that high level of protein phosphorylation may play important roles in regulating many metabolic pathways and bacterial virulence.

TI  == oral immunization with recombinant lactococcus lactis confers protection against  respiratory pneumococcal infection.
AB  == in the present work, we evaluated if oral immunization with the pneumococcal protective protein a (pppa), expressed in the cell wall of lactococcus lactis (l. lactis pppa+), was able to confer protective immunity against streptococcus pneumoniae. mice were immunized orally with l. lactis pppa+ for 5 consecutive days. vaccination was performed one (nonboosted group) or 2 times with a 2 week interval between each immunization (boosted group). oral priming with l. lactis pppa+ induced the production of anti-pppa igm, igg, and iga antibodies in serum and in bronchoalveolar (bal) and intestinal (if) lavage fluids. boosting with l.  lactis pppa+ increased the levels of mucosal and systemic immunoglobulins. moreover, the avidity and the opsonophagocytic activity of anti-pppa antibodies were significantly improved in the boosted group. the presence of both igg1 and igg2a anti-pppa antibodies in serum and bal and the production of both interferon gamma and interleukin-4 by spleen cells from immunized mice indicated that l. lactis pppa+ stimulated a mixture of th1 and th2 responses. the ability of l. lactis pppa+ to confer cross-protective immunity was evaluated using challenge assays with serotypes 3, 6b, 14, and 23f. lung bacterial cell counts and hemocultures showed that immunization with l. lactis pppa+ improved resistance against all the serotypes assessed, including serotype 3, which was highly virulent in our experimental animal model. to our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of protection against respiratory pneumococcal infection induced by oral administration of a recombinant lactococcal vaccine.

TI  == stimulation of respiratory immunity by oral administration of lactococcus lactis.
AB  == this work demonstrates that non-recombinant lactococcus lactis nz, administered by the oral route at the proper dose, is able to improve resistance against pneumococcal infection. lactococcus lactis nz oral administration was able to improve pathogen lung clearance, increased survival of infected mice, and reduced lung injuries. this effect was related to an upregulation of the respiratory innate and specific immune responses. administration of l. lactis nz improved production of bronchoalveolar lavage (bal) fluid tnf-alpha, enhanced recruitment  of neutrophils into the alveolar spaces, and induced a higher activation of bal phagocytes compared with the control group. lactococcus lactis nz administered orally stimulated the iga cycle, increased iga+ cells in intestine and bronchus,  and improved production of bal il-4 and il-10 during infection. moreover, mice treated with l. lactis nz showed higher levels of bal anti-pneumococcal iga and igg. taking into consideration that orally administered l. lactis nz stimulates both the innate and the specific immune responses in the respiratory tract and that bacterial and viral antigens have been efficiently produced in this strain,  l. lactis nz is an excellent candidate for the development of an effective pneumococcal oral vaccine.

TI  == nasal administration of lactococcus lactis improves local and systemic immune responses against streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == lactococcus lactis nz9000 is a non-pathogenic non-invasive bacterium extensively  used for the delivery of antigens and cytokines at the mucosal level. however, there are no reports concerning the per se immunomodulatory capacity of this strain. the aim of the present study was to investigate the intrinsic immunostimulating properties of the nasal administration of l. lactis nz9000 in a pneumococcal infection model. mice were preventively treated with l. lactis (2, 5 or 7 days with 10(8) cells/day per mouse) and then challenged with streptococcus  pneumoniae. the local and the systemic immune responses were evaluated. our results showed that nasal administration of l. lactis for 5 days (lln5d) increased the clearance rate of s. pneumoniae from lung and prevented the dissemination of pneumococci into blood. this effect coincided with an upregulation of the innate and specific immune responses in both local and systemic compartments. lln5d increased phagocyte activation in lung, blood and bone marrow, determined by nbt and peroxidase tests. anti-pneumococcal immunoglobulin (ig)a in bronchoalveolar lavages (bal) and igg in bal and serum were increased in the lln5d group. lung tissue injury was reduced by lln5d treatment as revealed by histopathological examination and albumin concentration  and lactate dehydrogenase activity in bal. the adjuvant effect of l. lactis in our infection model would be an important advantage for its use as a delivery vehicle of pneumococcal proteins and nasal immunization with recombinant l. lactis emerges as an effective route of vaccination for both systemic and mucosal immunity against pneumococcal infection.

TI  == nasal immunization with lactococcus lactis expressing the pneumococcal protective protein a induces protective immunity in mice.
AB  == nisin-controlled gene expression was used to develop a recombinant strain of lactococcus lactis that is able to express the pneumococcal protective protein a  (pppa) on its surface. immunodetection assays confirmed that after the induction  with nisin, the pppa antigen was predictably and efficiently displayed on the cell surface of the recombinant strain, which was termed l. lactis pppa. the production of mucosal and systemically specific antibodies in adult and young mice was evaluated after mice were nasally immunized with l. lactis pppa. immunoglobulin m (igm), igg, and iga anti-pppa antibodies were detected in the serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of adult and young mice, which showed that pppa expressed in l. lactis was able to induce a strong mucosal and systemic immune response. challenge survival experiments demonstrated that immunization with l. lactis pppa was able to increase resistance to systemic and respiratory infection with different pneumococcal serotypes, and passive immunization assays  of naive young mice demonstrated a direct correlation between anti-pppa antibodies and protection. the results presented in this study demonstrate three  major characteristics of the effectiveness of nasal immunization with pppa expressed as a protein anchored to the cell wall of l. lactis: it elicited cross-protective immunity against different pneumococcal serotypes, it afforded protection against both systemic and respiratory challenges, and it induced protective immunity in mice of different ages.

AB  == cody is a nutritional regulator mainly involved in amino acid metabolism. it has  been extensively studied in bacillus subtilis and lactococcus lactis. we investigated the role of cody in gene regulation and virulence of the human pathogen streptococcus pneumoniae. we constructed a cody mutant and examined the  effect on gene and protein expression by microarray and two-dimensional differential gel electrophoresis analysis. the pneumococcal cody regulon was found to consist predominantly of genes involved in amino acid metabolism but also several other cellular processes, such as carbon metabolism and iron uptake. by means of electrophoretic mobility shift assays and dna footprinting, we showed that most of the targets identified are under the direct control of cody. by mutating dna predicted to represent the cody box based on the l. lactis consensus, we demonstrated that this sequence is indeed required for in vitro dna binding to target promoters. similar to l. lactis, dna binding of cody was enhanced in the presence of branched-chain amino acids, but not by gtp. we observed in experimental mouse models that cody is transcribed in the murine nasopharynx and lungs and is specifically required for colonization. this finding was underscored by the diminished ability of the cody mutant to adhere to nasopharyngeal cells in vitro. furthermore, we found that pcpa, activated by cody, is required for adherence to nasopharyngeal cells, suggesting a direct link between nutritional regulation and adherence. in conclusion, pneumococcal cody predominantly regulates genes involved in amino acid metabolism and contributes to the early stages of infection, i.e., colonization of the nasopharynx.

TI  == inhibitory effect of gram-negative and gram-positive microorganisms against helicobacter pylori clinical isolates.
AB  == objectives: to determine the in vitro inhibitory effect of several gram-negative  and gram-positive microorganisms against helicobacter pylori clinical isolates. methods: the in vitro effect of 32 microorganisms against h. pylori clinical isolates was determined by a diffusion method. time-kill assay was performed with two staphylococcus spp. strains. results: anti-h. pylori activity was detected with saccharomyces cerevisiae, bacillus spp., 1 enterococcus faecium and 2 lactobacillus spp. against 7, 11, 1, 5 and 6 h. pylori strains tested. all staphylococcus spp. showed an anti-h. pylori effect: one staphylococcus auricularis and two staphylococcus epidermidis against all h. pylori tested; staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus hominis and s. auricularis against six, five and seven h. pylori strains; and two other coagulase-negative staphylococcus against one h. pylori strain. an inhibitory effect was detected with one escherichia coli against one h. pylori. klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella spp. and acinetobacter baumannii showed activity against four h. pylori strains, and enterobacter cloacae and stenotrophomonas maltophilia showed activity against 14  h. pylori isolates. no anti-h. pylori activity was detected with one lactobacillus spp., two lactococcus lactis, four streptococcus spp., one bacillus cereus, one e. faecium, one enterococcus faecalis, one e. coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and klebsiella oxytoca. time-kill assay showed bactericidal activity at 24 h with the two staphylococcus spp. strains tested. conclusions: several strains of human pathogens or commensal bacteria are able to inhibit h. pylori growth in vitro and it is a strain-dependent phenomenon.

TI  == the unconventional xer recombination machinery of streptococci/lactococci.
AB  == homologous recombination between circular sister chromosomes during dna replication in bacteria can generate chromosome dimers that must be resolved into monomers prior to cell division. in escherichia coli, dimer resolution is achieved by site-specific recombination, xer recombination, involving two paralogous tyrosine recombinases, xerc and xerd, and a 28-bp recombination site (dif) located at the junction of the two replication arms. xer recombination is tightly controlled by the septal protein ftsk. xercd recombinases and ftsk are found on most sequenced eubacterial genomes, suggesting that the xer recombination system as described in e. coli is highly conserved among prokaryotes. we show here that streptococci and lactococci carry an alternative xer recombination machinery, organized in a single recombination module. this corresponds to an atypical 31-bp recombination site (dif(sl)) associated with a dedicated tyrosine recombinase (xers). in contrast to the e. coli xer system, only a single recombinase is required to recombine dif(sl), suggesting a different mechanism in the recombination process. despite this important difference, xers can only perform efficient recombination when dif(sl) sites are  located on chromosome dimers. moreover, the xers/dif(sl) recombination requires the streptococcal protein ftsk(sl), probably without the need for direct protein-protein interaction, which we demonstrated to be located at the division  septum of lactococcus lactis. acquisition of the xers recombination module can be considered as a landmark of the separation of streptococci/lactococci from other  firmicutes and support the view that xer recombination is a conserved cellular function in bacteria, but that can be achieved by functional analogs.

TI  == isolation and characterization of a new plasmid pspnp1 from a multidrug-resistant clone of streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == a novel streptococcus pneumoniae plasmid (pspnp1; 5413bp) has been isolated from  the multidrug-resistant clone poland(23f)-16, and its complete nucleotide sequence has been determined. sequence analysis predicted seven co-directional open reading frames and comparative analyses revealed that plasmid pspnp1 is different to pdp1, the only previously described pneumococcal plasmid, whereas it is highly similar to pst08, a plasmid from streptococcus thermophilus. a double-stranded origin for replication similar to the replication origin of the pc194/pub110 family was located upstream of the putative rep gene (orf2). it also contained a 144-bp region with over 60% identity to the single-stranded origin type a of the streptococcus agalactiae plasmid pmv158/pls1. detection of single-stranded dna by southern blot analysis indicated that pspnp1 replicates via a rolling circle mechanism. interestingly, the product of orf1 has a putative zonular occludens toxin conserved domain present in toxigenic strains of vibrio cholerae. real-time pcr assays revealed that this orf was expressed. hybridization experiments showed that the pspnp1 replicon was unusual among other examined antibiotic-resistant pneumococcal clones, although the recombinant plasmids based on pspnp1 were able to replicate in bacillus subtilis and lactococcus lactis.

TI  == mucosal delivery of a pneumococcal vaccine using lactococcus lactis affords protection against respiratory infection.
AB  == background: economical and effective vaccines against streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) are needed for implementation in poorer countries where the disease burden is highest. here, we evaluated lactococcus lactis intracellularly  producing the pneumococcal surface protein a (pspa) as a mucosal vaccine in conferring protection against pneumococcal disease. methods: mice were intranasally (inl) immunized with the lactococcal vaccine. control groups were also immunized with similar amounts of recombinant pspa administered inl or subcutaneously with alum. pspa-specific antibodies in serum samples and lung lavage fluids were measured before challenge in intraperitoneal sepsis and inl respiratory-infection models of pneumococcal disease. results: the lactococcal vaccine afforded better protection against respiratory challenge with pneumococcus than did vaccination with purified antigen given inl or by injection with alum. this finding was associated with a shift toward a th1-mediated immune  response characterized by reduced antibody titers to the pspa antigen. in the sepsis model, the lactococcal vaccine afforded resistance to disease on a par with that obtained with the injected vaccine, demonstrating its efficacy against  different forms of pneumococcal disease. conclusion: given the safety profile of  l. lactis, there is considerable potential to develop a pneumococcal vaccine for  use in humans and to broaden this approach to combat other major pathogens.

TI  == identification of an essential gene responsible for d-asp incorporation in the lactococcus lactis peptidoglycan crossbridge.
AB  == bacteria such as lactococcus lactis have d-aspartate (d-asp) or its amidated derivative d-asparagine (d-asn), in their peptidoglycan (pg) interpeptide crossbridge. we performed a subtractive genome analysis to identify l. lactis gene yxba, orthologues of which being present only in bacteria containing d-amino acids in their pg crossbridge, but absent from those that instead insert l-amino  acids or glycine. inactivation of yxba required a complementing streptococcus pneumoniae murmn genes, which express enzymes that incorporate l-ser-l-ala or l-ala-l-ala in the pg crossbridge. our results show that (i) yxba encodes d-asp ligase responsible for incorporation of d-asp in the pg crossbridge, and we therefore renamed it as asla, (ii) it is an essential gene, which makes its product a potential target for specific antimicrobials, (iii) the absence of d-asp may be complemented by l-ser-l-ala or l-ala-l-ala in the l. lactis pg, indicating that the pg synthesis machinery is not selective for the side-chain residues, and (iv) lactococcal strains having l-amino acids in their pg crossbridge display defects in cell wall integrity, but are able to efficiently anchor cell wall proteins, indicating relative flexibility of lactococcal transpeptidation reactions with respect to changes in pg sidechain composition.

TI  == development of lactococcal gem-based pneumococcal vaccines.
AB  == we report the development of a novel protein-based nasal vaccine against streptococcus pneumoniae, in which three pneumococcal proteins were displayed on  the surface of a non-recombinant, killed lactococcus lactis-derived delivery system, called gram-positive enhancer matrix (gem). the gem particles induced the production of the proinflammatory cytokine tumour necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) by macrophages as well as the maturation of dendritic cells. the pneumococcal proteins iga1 protease (iga1p), putative proteinase maturation protein a (ppma) and streptococcal lipoprotein a (slra) were anchored in trans to the surface of the gem particles after recombinant production of the antigens in  l. lactis as hybrids with a lactococcal cell wall binding domain, named protein anchor domain (pa). intranasal immunisation with the slra-iga1p or trivalent vaccine combinations without additional adjuvants showed significant protection against fatal pneumococcal pneumonia in mice. the gem-based trivalent vaccine is  a potential pneumococcal vaccine candidate that is expected to be easy to administer, safe and affordable to produce.

TI  == heterologous production and secretion of clostridium perfringens beta-toxoid in closely related gram-positive hosts.
AB  == the spore forming bacterium clostridium perfringens is a widely occurring pathogen. vaccines against c. perfringens type b and c are currently manufactured using beta-toxin secreted by virulent c. perfringens strains. large-scale production of vaccines from virulent strains requires stringent safety conditions and costly detoxification and control steps. therefore, it would be beneficial to produce this toxin in a safe production host and in an immunogenic, but non-toxic form (toxoid). for high-level expression of beta-toxoid, we cloned the highly active ribosomal rpsf promoter of bacillus subtilis in a broad host range multicopy plasmid. in b. subtilis, we obtained high intracellular production, up  to 200 microg ml(-1) culture. however, the beta-toxoid was poorly secreted. the employed rpsf expression system allowed using the same expression plasmids in other heterologous hosts such as lactococcus lactis and streptococcus pneumoniae. in these organisms secretion of beta-toxoid was ten times higher compared to the  best producing b. subtilis strain. these results show the usefulness of the rpsf  based broad host range expression system.

TI  == lactococcus lactis gem particles displaying pneumococcal antigens induce local and systemic immune responses following intranasal immunization.
AB  == the present work reports the use of non-living non-recombinant bacteria as a delivery system for mucosal vaccination. antigens are bound to the cell-wall of pretreated lactococcus lactis, designated as gram-positive enhancer matrix (gem), by means of a peptidoglycan binding domain. the influence of the gem particles on the antigen-specific serum antibody response was studied. following nasal immunization with the gem-based vaccines, antibody responses were induced at systemic and local levels. furthermore, different gem-based vaccines could be used consecutively in the same mice without adverse effects or loss of activity.  taken together, the results evidence the adjuvant properties of the gem particles and indicate that gem-based vaccines can be used repeatedly and are particularly  suitable for nasal immunization purposes.

TI  == induction of systemic and mucosal immune response and decrease in streptococcus pneumoniae colonization by nasal inoculation of mice with recombinant lactic acid bacteria expressing pneumococcal surface antigen a.
AB  == mucosal epithelia constitute the first barriers to be overcome by pathogens during infection. the induction of protective iga in this location is important for the prevention of infection and can be achieved through different mucosal immunization strategies. lactic acid bacteria have been tested in the last few years as live vectors for the delivery of antigens at mucosal sites, with promising results. in this work, streptococcus pneumoniae psaa antigen was expressed in different species of lactic acid bacteria, such as lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus plantarum, and lactobacillus helveticus. after nasal inoculation of c57bl/6 mice, their ability to induce both systemic (igg in serum) and mucosal (iga in saliva, nasal and bronchial washes) anti-psaa antibodies was determined. immunization with l. lactis mg1363 induced very low levels of iga and igg, possibly by the low amount of psaa expressed in this strain and its short persistence in the nasal mucosa. all three lactobacilli persisted in the nasal mucosa for 3 days and produced a similar amount of psaa protein (150-250 ng per 10(9) cfu). however, l. plantarum ncdo1193 and l. helveticus atcc15009 elicited the highest antibody response (iga and igg). vaccination with recombinant lactobacilli but not with recombinant l. lactis led  to a decrease in s. pneumoniae recovery from nasal mucosa upon a colonization challenge. our results confirm that certain lactobacillus strains have intrinsic  properties that make them suitable candidates for mucosal vaccination experiments.

TI  == to have neighbour's fare: extending the molecular toolbox for streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == in past years, several useful genetic tools have been developed to study the molecular biology of streptococcus pneumoniae. in order to extend the existing spectrum of tools, advantage was taken of the toolbox originally developed for the closely related bacterium lactococcus lactis, which was adapted for the manipulation of s. pneumoniae. the modified tools are as follows. (i) an improved nisin-inducible (over)expression system (nice). the nisrk genes, encoding a two-component system essential for transcriptional activation in response to nisin, were integrated into the bgaa locus of s. pneumoniae d39. in this strain,  d39nisrk, addition of nisin resulted in the overexpression of several genes placed under the control of the nisin-inducible promoter, while no detectable expression was observed in the absence of nisin. (ii) a lacz reporter system. using strain d39nisrk, which lacks endogenous beta-galactosidase activity, the usefulness of the lacz reporter vector pori13 for the generation of chromosomal transcriptional fusions was demonstrated. in addition, the repa gene, necessary for the replication of pori13, was introduced into the bgaa locus, thereby generating a background for plasmid-based promoter expression studies. (iii) a simplified chemically defined medium, which supports growth of all sequenced s. pneumoniae strains to a level comparable to that in complex medium. (iv) a system for the introduction of unmarked deletions and mutations into the chromosome, which is independent of the genotype of the target strain. most of these systems  were successfully applied in strains r6 and tigr4 as well. in addition, the tools offer several improvements and advantages compared to existing ones. thus, the molecular toolbox for s. pneumoniae has been successfully extended.

TI  == mucosal vaccine delivery of antigens tightly bound to an adjuvant particle made from food-grade bacteria.
AB  == mucosal immunization with subunit vaccines requires new types of antigen delivery vehicles and adjuvants for optimal immune responses. we have developed a non-living and non-genetically modified gram-positive bacterial delivery particle (gem) that has built-in adjuvant activity and a high loading capacity for externally added heterologous antigens that are fused to a high affinity binding  domain. this binding domain, the protein anchor (pa), is derived from the lactococcus lactis acma cell-wall hydrolase, and contains three repeats of a lysm-type cell-wall binding motif. antigens are produced as antigen-pa fusions by recombinant expression systems that secrete the hybrid proteins into the culture  growth medium. gem particles are then used as affinity beads to isolate the antigen-pa fusions from the complex growth media in a one step procedure after removal of the recombinant producer cells. this procedure is also highly suitable for making multivalent vaccines. the resulting vaccines are stable at room temperature, lack recombinant dna, and mimic pathogens by their bacterial size, surface display of antigens and adjuvant activity of the bacterial components in  the gem particles. the gem-based vaccines do not require additional adjuvant for  eliciting high levels of specific antibodies in mucosal and systemic compartments.

AB  == in our continued effort to search for a streptococcus suis protein(s) that can serve as a vaccine candidate or a diagnostic reagent, we constructed and screened a gene library with a polyclonal antibody raised against the whole-cell protein of s. suis type 2. a clone that reacted with the antibody was identified and characterized. analysis revealed that the gene encoding the protein is localized  within a 2.0-kbp ecori dna fragment. the nucleotide sequence contained an open reading frame that encoded a polypeptide of 445 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 46.4 kda. by in vitro protein synthesis and western  blot experiments, the protein exhibited an electrophoretic mobility of approximately 38 kda. at the amino acid level the deduced primary sequence shared homology with sequences of unknown function from streptococcus pneumoniae (89%),  streptococcus mutans (86%), lactococcus lactis (80%), listeria monocytogenes (74%), and clostridium perfringens (64%). except for strains of serotypes 20, 26, 32, and 33, southern hybridization analysis revealed the presence of the gene in  strains of other s. suis serotypes and demonstrated restriction fragment length differences caused by a point mutation in the ecori recognition sequence. we confirmed expression of the 38-kda protein in the hybridization-positive isolates using specific antiserum against the purified protein. the recombinant protein was reactive with serum from pigs experimentally infected with virulent strains of s. suis type 2, suggesting that the protein is immunogenic and may serve as an antigen of diagnostic importance for the detection of most s. suis infections. pigs immunized with the recombinant 38-kda protein mounted antibody responses to  the protein and were completely protected against challenge with a strain of a homologous serotype, the wild-type virulent strain of s. suis type 2, suggesting  that it may be a good candidate for the development of a vaccine that can be used as protection against s. suis infection. analysis of the cellular fractions of the bacterium by western blotting revealed that the protein was present in the surface and cell wall extracts. the functional role of the protein with respect to pathogenesis and whether antibodies against the antigen confer protective immunity against diseases caused by strains of other pathogenic s. suis capsular  types remains to be determined.

TI  == the putative autolysin regulator lytr in streptococcus mutans plays a role in cell division and is growth-phase regulated.
AB  == streptococcus mutans is the primary odontopathogen present in supragingival plaque and causes the oral disease known as dental caries. colonization of the oral cavity by s. mutans requires the bacteria to adhere to the tooth surface and occurs by both sucrose-dependent and -independent mechanisms. sucrose-independent adhesion of s. mutans in vitro has been shown to involve an orf (orf0317) encoding a homologue (39 %) to lytr, a regulator of autolysin activity in bacillus subtilis. the protein encoded by orf0317, lytr, belongs to the lytr/cpsa/psr protein family. this family has a putative role in cell-wall structural maintenance, possibly through autolysin regulation. autolysins have also been shown to be important in surface adhesion in lactococcus lactis and in  the pathogenic properties of streptococcus pneumoniae. to investigate the role of autolysins in the adhesion and pathogenesis of s. mutans, a lytr mutant was constructed. the mutant grows in long chains, which may indicate a defect in cell division. further experiments with the mutant strain show increased autolytic activity, indicating that lytr attenuates s. mutans autolytic activity, possibly  through regulation of the expression of autolytic enzymes. no defect in cell-to-surface adherence or biofilm growth was seen in the lytr mutant. however, a connection between cell growth phase and transcription of lytr was found.

AB  == examination of supernatant fractions from broth cultures of lactobacillus fermentum br11 revealed the presence of a number of proteins, including a 27-kda  protein termed sep. the amino-terminal sequence of sep was determined, and the gene encoding it was cloned and sequenced. sep is a 205-amino-acid protein and contains a 30-amino-acid secretion signal and has overall homology (between 39 and 92% identity) with similarly sized proteins of lactobacillus reuteri, enterococcus faecium, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus agalactiae, and lactobacillus plantarum. the carboxy-terminal 81 amino acids of sep also have strong homology (86% identity) to the carboxy termini of the aggregation-promoting factor (apf) surface proteins of lactobacillus gasseri and  lactobacillus johnsonii. the mature amino terminus of sep contains a putative peptidoglycan-binding lysm domain, thereby making it distinct from apf proteins.  we have identified a common motif within lysm domains that is shared with carbohydrate binding yg motifs which are found in streptococcal glucan-binding proteins and glucosyltransferases. sep was investigated as a heterologous peptide expression vector in l. fermentum, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg and lactococcus lactis mg1363. modified sep containing an amino-terminal six-histidine epitope was found associated with the cells but was largely present in the supernatant in the l. fermentum, l. rhamnosus, and l. lactis hosts. sep as well as the previously described surface protein bspa were used to express and secrete in l.  fermentum or l. rhamnosus a fragment of human e-cadherin, which contains the receptor region for listeria monocytogenes. this study demonstrates that sep has  potential for heterologous protein expression and export in lactic acid bacteria.

AB  == the prsa-like gene from lactococcus lactis encoding its single homologue to prsa, an essential protein triggering the folding of secreted proteins in bacillus subtilis, was characterized. this gene, annotated pmpa, encodes a lipoprotein of  309 residues whose expression is increased 7- to 10-fold when the source of nitrogen is limited. a slight increase in the expression of the prsa-like protein (plp) in l. lactis removed the degradation products previously observed with the  staphylococcus hyicus lipase used as a model secreted protein. this shows that pmpa either triggers the folding of the secreted lipase or activates its degradation by the cell surface protease htra. unlike the case for b. subtilis, the inactivation of the gene encoding pmpa reduced only slightly the growth rate  of l. lactis in standard conditions. however, it almost stopped its growth when the lipase was overexpressed in the presence of salt in the medium. like prsa of  b. subtilis and prtm of l. lactis, the l. lactis pmpa protein could thus have a foldase activity that facilitates protein secretion. these proteins belong to the third family of peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans-isomerases (ppiases) for which parvulin is the prototype. almost all plp from gram-positive bacteria contain a domain with the ppiase signature. an exception to this situation was found only in streptococcaceae, the family to which l. lactis belongs. plp from streptococcus pneumoniae and enterococcus faecalis possess this signature, but those of l. lactis, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus mutans do not. however, secondary structure predictions suggest that the folding of plp is conserved over the entire length of the proteins, including the unconserved signature region. the activity associated with the expression of pmpa in l. lactis and these genomic data show that either the ppiase motif is not necessary for ppiase activity or, more likely, pmpa foldase activity does not necessarily require ppiase activity.

TI  == determination of enterococcus faecalis groesl full-length sequence and application for species identification.
AB  == amplification of the partial cpn60 (or groel) gene segment has been used for identification of many bacteria, including enterococcus species. to obtain more sequence data from groesl genes of enterococcus faecalis, the full-length sequence of the e. faecalis groesl genes containing groes (285 bp), spacer (57 bp), and groel (1,626 bp) was determined. a database search of genbank revealed that the deduced e. faecalis groes and groel proteins show significant homology to the groes and groel proteins of other bacteria. the groel (groel) of e. faecalis had the highest identity with streptococcus pneumoniae (81.8% amino acid sequence identity and 73.0% nucleotide sequence identity), followed by lactococcus zeae, while groes (groes) had 60.2% (64.6%) identity with lactobacillus zeae and 58.5% (66.2%) identity with lactococcus lactis, followed by 57.0% (65.5%) identity with bacillus subtilis. based on the groes sequence, an e. faecalis-specific pcr assay was developed, and this pcr assay was positive for all the e. faecalis strains tested. dot blot hybridization using either groes or  groel as the probe distinguished e. faecalis clearly from other species, indicating that both genes can be used as suitable targets for e. faecalis identification. moreover, broad-range pcr-restriction fragment length polymorphism of groesl was designed to differentiate eight commonly encountered enterococcus species. the enterococcus species of reference strains could be easily differentiated on the basis of restriction patterns produced by haeiii and rsai. the dna-based assays developed in this study provide an alternative to currently used methods of identification for clinically important enterococcal species.

TI  == evidence for horizontal transfer of ssudat1i restriction-modification genes to the streptococcus suis genome.
AB  == different strains of streptococcus suis serotypes 1 and 2 isolated from pigs either contained a restriction-modification (r-m) system or lacked it. the r-m system was an isoschizomer of streptococcus pneumoniae dpnii, which recognizes nucleotide sequence 5'-gatc-3'. the nucleotide sequencing of the genes encoding the r-m system in s. suis dat1, designated ssudat1i, showed that the ssudat1i gene region contained two methyltransferase genes, designated ssuma and ssumb, as does the dpnii system. the deduced amino acid sequences of m. ssuma and m.ssumb showed 70 and 90% identity to m.dpnii and m.dpna, respectively. however, the ssudat1i system contained two isoschizomeric restriction endonuclease genes, designated ssura and ssurb. the deduced amino acid sequence of r.ssura was 49% identical to that of r.dpnii, and r.ssurb was 72% identical to r.lladchi of lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris dch-4. the four ssudat1i genes overlapped and  were bounded by purine biosynthetic gene clusters in the following gene order: purf-purm-purn-purh-ssuma-ssumb-ssura++ +-ssurb-purd-pure. the g+c content of the ssudat1i gene region (34.1%) was lower than that of the pur region (48.9%), suggesting horizontal transfer of the ssudat1i system. no transposable element or long-repeat sequence was found in the flanking regions. the ssudat1i genes were functional by themselves, as they were individually expressed in escherichia coli. comparison of the sequences between strains with and without the r-m system showed that only the region from 53 bp upstream of ssuma to 5 bp downstream of ssurb was inserted in the intergenic sequence between purh and purd and that the  insertion target site was not the recognition site of ssudat1i. no notable substitutions or insertions could be found, and the structures were conserved among all the strains. these results suggest that the ssudat1i system could have  been integrated into the s. suis chromosome by an illegitimate recombination mechanism.

TI  == regulation of growth inhibition at high temperature, autolysis, transformation and adherence in streptococcus pneumoniae by clpc.
AB  == the clpc atpase is a subfamily of hsp100/clp molecular chaperones-regulators of proteolysis. by screening a library of loss of function mutants for the ability to survive treatment with penicillin, we identified the gene clpc. the corresponding protein was identified as a clpc atpase, sharing strong peptide sequence identity with clpc of bacillus subtilis, listeria monocytogenes and lactococcus lactis. northern blot experiments showed that expression of clpc was  induced in response to high temperature (40-42 degrees c) versus 37 degrees c, suggesting that clpc is a heat shock protein. insertional duplication mutagenesis of clpc resulted in increased tolerance to high temperature; a result in contrast to other bacterial clp proteases. the clpc-deficient mutant formed long chains and failed to undergo lysis after treatment with penicillin or vancomycin. the effect of the clpc mutation extended to deficiency of adherence to the human type ii alveolar cells. finally, the clpc disruption resulted in decreased genetic transformation. western blot analysis demonstrated that the mutant failed to express pneumolysin and the choline-binding proteins lyta, cbpa, cbpe, cbpf, cbpj. these results suggest that the heat shock protein clpc plays an essential complex pleiotropic role in pneumococcal physiology, including cell growth under  heat stress, cell division, autolysis, adherence and transformation.

TI  == differential protein expression in phenotypic variants of streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == streptococcus pneumoniae undergoes spontaneous phase variation resulting in opaque and transparent colony forms. differences in colony opacity correlate with differences in virulence: the transparent variants are more capable of colonizing the nasopharynx, whereas the opaque variants show increased virulence during systemic infections. to gain insight into the pathogenesis of pneumococcal disease at the molecular level, protein expression patterns of the phenotypic variants of two pneumococcal strains were compared by high-resolution two-dimensional protein electrophoresis. in comparison with transparent variants, the opaque variants reduced the expression of two proteins and overexpressed one  protein. the proteins were identified by mass spectrometric analysis. the protein overexpressed in the opaque phenotype revealed significant homology to elongation factor ts of helicobacter pylori. one of the two proteins that were underexpressed in the opaque variants revealed significant homology to the proteinase maturation protein prtm of lactocobacillus paracasei, a member of the  family of peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerases. a consensus lipoprotein signal sequence suggests that the putative proteinase maturation protein a, designated ppma, is located at the surface of the pneumococcus and may play a role in the maturation of surface or secreted proteins. the second underexpressed protein was identified as pyruvate oxidase, spxb. the lower spxb expression in opaque variants most probably explains the reduced production of hydrogen peroxide, a reaction product of spxb, in this variant. since a spxb-defective pneumococcal mutant has decreased ability to colonize the nasopharynx (b. spellerberg, d. r. cundell, j. sandros, b. j. pearce, i. idanpaan-heikkila, c. rosenow, and h. r. masure, 1996. mol. microbiol. 19:803-813, 1996), our data suggest that spxb plays an important role in enhancing the ability of transparent variants to efficiently colonize the nasopharynx.

TI  == heterologous expression of an immunogenic pneumococcal type 3 capsular polysaccharide in lactococcus lactis.
AB  == in order to develop a new system for the analysis of capsular biosynthetic pathways we have explored the possibility of expressing type 3 capsular polysaccharide (cps) from the pathogen streptococcus pneumoniae in lactococcus lactis, an unencapsulated lactic acid bacterium being developed as a vaccine delivery vehicle for mucosal immunization. only three of the four type 3 cps biosynthesis genes were found to be necessary for the abundant formation (120 mg  liter(-1)) of an extracellular type 3 cps in l. lactis, implying a role for the type 3-specific synthase in the extracellular transport of the cps or implying the existence of an alternative export system in l. lactis. the authenticity of the expressed heterologous polysaccharide was established by chemical and immunological analyses. proton and carbon nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of cpss purified from l. lactis and s. pneumoniae showed that the two cps structures were identical. when mice were immunized intraperitoneally with 3.5 x  10(6) cfu of live recombinant lactococci expressing a total of approximately 0.5  microgram of type 3 cps, the immune responses elicited appeared identical to those observed in mice inoculated with 0.5 microgram of type 3 cps purified from  s. pneumoniae. these findings show that l. lactis is a useful host in which to study the role and function of genes involved in the production of bacterial capsules. additionally, l. lactis shows potential as a host for the safe production of capsule antigens and as a vaccine delivery vehicle for polysaccharide antigens.

TI  == functional analysis of glycosyltransferase genes from lactococcus lactis and other gram-positive cocci: complementation, expression, and diversity.
AB  == sixteen exopolysaccharide (eps)-producing lactococcus lactis strains were analyzed for the chemical compositions of their epss and the locations, sequences, and organization of the eps genes involved in eps biosynthesis. this allowed the grouping of these strains into three major groups, representatives of which were studied in detail. previously, we have characterized the eps gene cluster of strain nizo b40 (group i) and determined the function of three of its  glycosyltransferase (gtf) genes. fragments of the eps gene clusters of strains nizo b35 (group ii) and nizo b891 (group iii) were cloned, and these encoded the  nizo b35 priming galactosyltransferase, the nizo b891 priming glucosyltransferase, and the nizo b891 galactosyltransferase involved in the second step of repeating-unit synthesis. the nizo b40 priming glucosyltransferase gene epsd was replaced with an erythromycin resistance gene, and this resulted in loss of eps production. this epsd deletion was complemented with priming gtf genes from gram-positive organisms with known function and substrate specificity. although no eps production was found with priming galactosyltransferase genes from l. lactis or streptococcus thermophilus, complementation with priming glucosyltransferase genes involved in l. lactis eps and streptococcus pneumoniae  capsule biosynthesis could completely restore or even increase eps production in  l. lactis.

TI  == ctsr, a novel regulator of stress and heat shock response, controls clp and molecular chaperone gene expression in gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == clpp and clpc of bacillus subtillis encode subunits of the clp atp-dependent protease and are required for stress survival, including growth at high temperature. they play essential roles in stationary phase adaptive responses such as the competence and sporulation developmental pathways, and belong to the  so-called class iii group of heat shock genes, whose mode of regulation is unknown and whose expression is induced by heat shock or general stress conditions. the product of ctsr, the first gene of the clpc operon, has now been  shown to act as a repressor of both clpp and clpc, as well as clpe, which encodes a novel member of the hsp100 clp atpase family. the ctsr protein was purified and shown to bind specifically to the promoter regions of all three clp genes. random mutagenesis, dnasel footprinting and dna sequence deletions and comparisons were  used to define a consensus ctsr recognition sequence as a directly repeated heptad upstream from the three clp genes. this target sequence was also found upstream from clp and other heat shock genes of several gram-positive bacteria, including listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus salivarius, s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, s. thermophilus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, leuconostoc oenos, lactobacillus sake, lactococcus lactis and clostridium acetobutylicum. ctsr homologues were also identified in several of these bacteria, indicating that heat shock regulation by ctsr is highly conserved in gram-positive bacteria.

TI  == use of the lactococcal nisa promoter to regulate gene expression in gram-positive bacteria: comparison of induction level and promoter strength.
AB  == we characterized the regulated activity of the lactococcal nisa promoter in strains of the gram-positive species streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, and bacillus subtilis. nisa promoter activity was dependent on the proteins nisr and nisk, which constitute a two-component signal transduction system that responds to the  extracellular inducer nisin. the nisin sensitivity and inducer concentration required for maximal induction varied among the strains. significant induction of the nisa promoter (10- to 60-fold induction) was obtained in all of the species studied at a nisin concentration just below the concentration at which growth is  inhibited. the efficiency of the nisa promoter was compared to the efficiencies of the spac, xyla, and laca promoters in b. subtilis and in s. pyogenes. because  nisa promoter-driven expression is regulated in many gram-positive bacteria, we expect it to be useful for genetic studies, especially studies with pathogenic streptococci in which no other regulated promoters have been described.

TI  == the -16 region of bacillus subtilis and other gram-positive bacterial promoters.
AB  == the bacillus subtilis alpha-amylase promoter amy p contains an essential tgtg motif (-16 region) upstream of the -10 region. mutations of this region significantly reduced in vitro promoter strength. a -15 g-->c transversion eliminated transcription from amy p by both b.subtilis and escherichia coli rna polymerase (rnap). a second alpha-amylase promoter ( amy p2) also required the -16 region for function. to determine conserved sequences in promoters containing -16 region elements, sequences of 64 b.subtilis promoters with the second tg motif of the -16 region were aligned and analyzed. unlike the e.coli class of 'extended -10 promoters', with a similar tg motif but lacking a -35 region, the -16 region promoters contain highly conserved -35 regions. they also contain conserved a n and t n tracts upstream of the -35 region. in addition, we analyzed all available gram-positive bacterial promoter compilations to determine the generality of the -16 region. from this analysis, the -16 region trtg motif (r =  purine) appears to be a basic element found in a large portion of gram-positive bacterial promoters and is, in the case of at least the alpha-amylase promoters,  necessary for transcription by the major form of b.subtilis and e.coli rnap.

TI  == evolution of streptococcus thermophilus bacteriophage genomes by modular exchanges followed by point mutations and small deletions and insertions.
AB  == comparative sequence analysis of 40% of the genomes from two prototype streptococcus thermophilus bacteriophages (lytic group i phage phi sfi19 and the  cos site containing temperate phage phi sfi21) suggested two processes in the evolution of their genomes. in a first evolutionarily distant phase the basic genome structure was apparently constituted by modular exchanges. over the 17-kb-long dna segment analyzed in the present report, we observed clusters of genes with similarity to genes from leuconostoc oenos phage l10, lactococcus lactis phage bk5-t, and streptococcus pneumoniae phage dp-1. a chimeric protein was predicted for orf 1291 which showed similarity to both phage bk5-t and phage  dp-1 proteins. the very large orf 1626 gene product showed similarity to two adjacent genes from the lactobacillus delbrueckii phage ll-h and further phage proteins (lactococcus lactis, bacillus subtills). the similarities were localized to distinct parts of this apparently multifunctional protein. the putative phi sfi19 lysin showed similarity to both lysins of phages and cellular enzymes. in a second, evolutionarily more recent, phase the s, thermophilus phage genomes apparently diversified by point mutations and small deletions/insertions. over the investigated 17-kb dna region phi sfi19 differed from phi sfi21 by 10% base pair changes, the majority of which were point mutations (mainly at the third codon position), while a third of the base pair differences were contributed by small deletions/insertions. the base pair changes were unevenly distributed. over the leuconostoc phage-related dna the change rate was high, while over the lactococcus and s. pneumoniae phage-related dna the change rate was low. we speculate that the degree of base pair change could provide relative time scales  for the modular exchange reactions observed in s. thermophilus phages.

TI  == the lytic enzyme of the pneumococcal phage dp-1: a chimeric lysin of intergeneric origin.
AB  == we have localized, cloned and characterized the genes coding for the lytic system of the pneumococcal phage dp-1. the lytic enzyme of this phage (pal), previously  identified as an n-acetyl-muramoyl-l-alanine amidase, shows a modular organization similar to that described for the lytic enzymes of streptococcus pneumoniae and its bacteriophages. the construction of chimeric enzymes between pneumococcus and bacteria (or phages) that belong to different gram-positive families has shown that the interchange of functional domains switches enzyme specificity. interestingly, pal appears to be a natural chimeric enzyme of intergeneric origin, that is the n-terminal domain was highly similar to that of  the murein hydrolase coded by a gene found in the phage bk5-t that infects lactococcus lactis, whereas the c-terminal domain was homologous to those found in the lytic enzymes of the pneumococcal system that is responsible for the binding to the choline residues present in the cell wall substrate. biochemical analysis of pal revealed that this enzyme shares important properties with those  of the major lyta101 autolysin found in an atypical, clinical pneumococcal isolate. these peculiar characteristics have been ascribed to a modified c-terminal domain. the natural chimeric enzyme described here provides further support for the theory of modular evolution of proteins and its characteristics also furnish interesting clues on the molecular mechanisms involved in the more invasive types of atypical pneumococci.

TI  == the pneumococcal cell wall degrading enzymes: a modular design to create new lysins?
AB  == autolysins are enzymes that degrade different bonds in the peptidoglycan and, eventually, cause the lysis and death of the cell. streptococcus pneumoniae contains a powerful autolytic enzyme that has been characterized as an n-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidase. we have cloned the lyta gene coding for this  amidase and studied in depth the genetics and expression of this gene, which represented the first molecular analysis of a bacterial autolysin. two observations have been fundamental in revealing further knowledge on the lytic systems of pneumococcus: (a) the well-documented dependence of the pneumococcal autolysin on the presence of choline in the cell wall for activity, and (b) the early observation that most pneumococcal phages also required the presence of this amino-alcohol in the growth medium to achieve a successful liberation of the phage progeny. we concluded that choline would serve as an element of strong selective pressure to preserve certain structures of the host and phage lytic enzymes which should lead to sequence homologies. we constructed active chimeras  between the lytic enzymes of s. pneumoniae and its bacteriophages using genes that share sequence homology as well as genes that completely lack homologous regions. in this way, we demonstrated that the pneumococcal lytic enzymes are the result of the fusion of two independent functional modules where the carboxy-terminal domain might be responsible for the specific recognition of choline-containing cell walls whereas the active center of these enzymes should be localized in the n-terminal part of the protein. the modular design postulated for the pneumococcal lysins seems to be a widespread model for many types of microbial proteins and the construction of functional chimeric proteins between the lytic enzymes of pneumococcus and those of several gram-positive microorganisms, like clostridium acetobutylicum or lactococcus lactis, provided interesting clues on the modular evolution of proteins. the study of several genes coding for the lytic enzymes of temperate phages of pneumococcus also highlighted on some evolutionary relationships between microorganisms. we suggest that lysogenic relationships may represent a common mechanism by which pathogenic organisms like pneumococcus should undergo a rapid adaptation to an evolving environment.

TI  == plasmid integration in a wide range of bacteria mediated by the integrase of lactobacillus delbrueckii bacteriophage mv4.
AB  == bacteriophage mv4 is a temperate phage infecting lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. during lysogenization, the phage integrates its genome into the host  chromosome at the 3' end of a trna(ser) gene through a site-specific recombination process (l. dupont et al., j. bacteriol., 177:586-595, 1995). a nonreplicative vector (pmc1) based on the mv4 integrative elements (attp site and integrase-coding int gene) is able to integrate into the chromosome of a wide range of bacterial hosts, including lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus casei  (two strains), lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, enterococcus faecalis, and streptococcus pneumoniae. integrative recombination of pmc1 into the chromosomes  of all of these species is dependent on the int gene product and occurs specifically at the pmc1 attp site. the isolation and sequencing of pmc1 integration sites from these bacteria showed that in lactobacilli, pmc1 integrated into the conserved trna(ser) gene. in the other bacterial species where this trna gene is less or not conserved; secondary integration sites either in potential protein-coding regions or in intergenic dna were used. a consensus sequence was deduced from the analysis of the different integration sites. the comparison of these sequences demonstrated the flexibility of the integrase for the bacterial integration site and suggested the importance of the trinucleotide  cct at the 5' end of the core in the strand exchange reaction.

AB  == the lysis genes of the lactobacillus gasseri bacteriophage phi adh were isolated  by complementation of a lambda sam mutation in escherichia coli. nucleotide sequencing of a 1,735-bp dna fragment revealed two adjacent coding regions of 342 bp (hol) and 951 bp (lys) in the same reading frame which appear to belong to a common transcriptional unit. proteins corresponding to the predicted gene products, holin (12.9 kda) and lysin (34.7 kda), were identified by in vitro and  in vivo expression of the cloned genes. the phi adh holin is a membrane-bound protein with structural similarity to lysis proteins of other phage, known to be  required for the transit of murein hydrolases through the cytoplasmic membrane. the phi adh lysin shows homology with mureinolytic enzymes encoded by the lactobacillus bulgaricus phage mv4, the streptococcus pneumoniae phage cp-1, cp-7, and cp-9, and the lactococcus lactis phage phi lc3. significant homology with the n termini of known muramidases suggests that phi adh lysin acts by a similar catalytic mechanism. in e. coli, the phi adh lysin seems to be associated with the total membrane fraction, from which it can be extracted with lauryl sarcosinate. either one of the phi adh lysis proteins provoked lysis of e. coli when expressed along with holins or lysins of phage lambda or bacillus subtilis phage phi 29. concomitant expression of the combined holin and lysin functions of phi adh in e. coli, however, did not result in efficient cell lysis.

TI  == comparative analysis of gene expression in streptococcus pneumoniae and lactococcus lactis.
AB  == the pfl10 plasmid vector for translational fusions was constructed. pfl10 is based in the promiscuous pls1 replicon and contains the pc194 cat gene deprived of its transcriptional promoter and shine-dalgarno (sd) sequence. three promoters (pcit, ppola and ptetl) from gram-positive bacteria, inserted in pfl10, were tested for their ability to drive transcription in lactococcus lactis and streptococcus pneumoniae. these promoters were coupled to the sd sequence of the  lactococcal citp gene fused to the cat gene. determination of the 5' ends of the  three mrnas by primer extension revealed the same start sites in both bacterial systems. however, it was observed a differential efficiency of promoter utilization by the rna polymerases from the two hosts. the transcriptional behavior correlates with expression of the cat gene measured by determinations of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (cat) activity. substitution of the sd of citp  by that of the t7 phi 10 gene rendered a similar decrease of the cat production in both bacterial systems.

TI  == cloning, molecular characterization, and expression of the genes encoding the lytic functions of lactococcal bacteriophage phi lc3: a dual lysis system of modular design.
AB  == the genes encoding the lysis proteins of lactococcus lactis bacteriophage phi lc3 were cloned, sequenced, and expressed in escherichia coli. the phi lc3 lysis genes, lysa and lysb, encode a membrane-disrupting protein (lysa) of 88 amino acids, and a cell wall degrading protein (lysb) of 429 amino acids, which shares  significant sequence similarity with lysins from the streptococcus pneumoniae phages cp-1, cp-7, and cp-9, and lactobacillus delbrueckii phage mv1. both lysa and lysb function in e. coli, as judged by lysis of the e. coli host cells and by lytic activity against lactococcal cells when the cloned lysa and lysb genes are  expressed. the lysa protein possesses two putative transmembrane helices and highly charged n- and c-termini, and is structurally similar to phage holins that are known to induce lesions in the inner membrane through which phage endolysin can be released to its cell wall substrate. the c-terminal end of lysb contains two highly homologous sequence repeats of 43 amino acids. the lysb repeats show strong sequence similarity to repeats found in lytic enzymes from other gram-positive bacteria and from bacillus subtilis phage phi 29 and pza, as well as in some functionally unrelated proteins, and they are possibly involved in binding of the enzyme to the cell wall substrate. the organization of the dual phi lc3 lysis system supports earlier suggestions that exchange of modular units  is an important principle in protein evolution.

TI  == molecular characterization of lactococcal bacteriophage tuc2009 and identification and analysis of genes encoding lysin, a putative holin, and two structural proteins.
AB  == bacteriophage tuc2009 is a temperate bacteriophage with a small isometric head and is isolated from lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris uc509. the phage genome is packaged by a headful mechanism, giving rise to circularly permuted molecules  with terminal redundancy. the unit genome size is approximately 39 kb. a map of the phage genome on which several determinants could be localized was constructed: pac, the site of initiation of dna packaging; lys (1,287 bp), specifying the phage lysin; s (267 bp), specifying a putative holin; and mp1 (522 bp) and mp2 (498 bp), each specifying one of the phage's structural proteins. lys, s, mp1, and mp2 were further characterized. lys and s are partially overlapping and appear to be part of one operon. the lysin shows homology to the  lysins of the streptococcus pneumoniae phages cp-9, cp-1, and cp-7. the putative  holin, which is thought to be involved in the release of lysin from the cytoplasm, contains two strongly hydrophobic presumptive transmembrane domains and a highly charged c-terminal domain.

TI  == location, characterization and expression of lytic enzyme-encoding gene, lyta, of lactococcus lactis bacteriophage phi us3.
AB  == gene lyta, which encodes lytic enzyme (lyta), of the isometric lactococcus lactis bacteriophage phi us3, was cloned and expressed in escherichia coli. the lyta gene was located on the physical map of the phi us3 32-kb dna that contains cohesive ends. initial expression of lyta was detected by lysis of an overlay of  cells of the phage-sensitive strain, l. lactis sk112. however, lyta appeared to have a broad spectrum and induced lysis in more than 30 different lactococcal strains. the nucleotide sequence of lyta showed a single open reading frame (orf) of 774 bp encoding a protein of 258 amino acids (aa) with a calculated m(r) of 28,977. this is in agreement with the size of 29 kda as determined for lyta produced in e. coli using a t7 expression system. the lyta gene is preceded by an orf that may code for a hydrophobic peptide of 66 aa containing a putative secretion signal, and two putative transmembrane helices. the deduced aa sequence of the phage phi us3 lyta shows similarities to that of the autolysin of streptococcus pneumoniae which is known to be an amidase.

TI  == immunoblotting and culture positive endocarditis.
AB  == serum samples from patients with endocarditis due to streptococcus mutans, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus lactis and a "nutritionally" variant streptococcus were immunoblotted against antigenic extracts from all five species. in s mutans endocarditis there was an endocarditis specific pattern of igm against bands of 220, 200, and 190 kilodaltons. in s pneumoniae igm against antibody of a molecular weight greater than 150 kilodaltons was specific to endocarditis. in s agalactiae igm against bands at 82, 71, and 66-67 kilodaltons was endocarditis specific. in s lactis endocarditis specific igm was present against antigenic bands at 105, 66, 61 and  58 kilodaltons. with the "nutritionally" variant streptococcus it was impossible  to distinguish between cases of endocarditis and controls.

TI  == silver-coated nylon fiber as an antibacterial agent.
AB  == a blend of nylon fiber and silver-coated nylon fiber (the latter known as x-static) was used in these experiments. this fiber was bactericidal when bacteria were exposed to it directly or to an extract derived from its prior incubation in salt solution. at ambient temperatures, a rapid exponential decrease of survival occurred, usually after a delay of approximately 1 h. the rate of killing (decrease of survival) increased with an increase in x-static percentage of the fiber blend, temperature of fiber extraction, concentration of  tris buffer present during extraction, and temperature at which bacteria were exposed to the extract. when bacteria were exposed to the extract at 37 degrees c as opposed to ambient temperature, there was no delay in onset of killing. escherichia coli was generally the indicator organism tested, but comparable results were also found for pseudomonas, klebsiella, staphylococcus, and streptococcus species. the rate of killing increased with increasing silver ion concentration of the fiber extract, as determined through atomic absorption spectrophotometry. the rate of killing was greater and the onset was earlier with an extract containing silver ions from fiber than with a salt solution containing the same concentration of silver ions from silver nitrate. studies of the kinetics of ion release suggested that x-static may be an effective, sustained-release antibacterial agent.

TI  == identification of streptococci in a medical laboratory.
AB  == a total of 965 cultures of streptococci received at a reference unit for identification were examined with api-20 strep kits and also by established methods. the api method, although it needed to be supplemented with additional tests, largely overcame the difficulty that pyogenic streptococci are usually identified by their serological reactions and that biochemical tests are used for the identification of the other streptococci. representatives of at least 24 established or possible species were identified.

TI  == identification of a streptococcal penicillin-binding protein that reacts very slowly with penicillin.
AB  == penicillin-binding protein (pbp) 5 of streptococcus faecium atcc 9790 has an unusually low affinity for penicillin (50% binding occurred at a penicillin level of 8 micrograms/ml after 60 min of incubation, and the protein only became labeled after 20 min of incubation with high concentrations of radioactive penicillin). pbps with similar properties are carried by strains of streptococcus durans, streptococcus faecalis, and streptococcus lactis but not by strains of groups a, b, c, and g streptococci or streptococcus pneumoniae. the strains carrying the slow-reacting pbp demonstrated a sensitivity to penicillin that was  several hundred times lower than that of strains not carrying it. spontaneous mutants with minimal inhibitory concentrations of penicillin of 20, 40, and 80 micrograms/ml were isolated from s. faecium atcc 9790. they all showed a dramatic increase in the amount of slow-reacting pbp produced. mutants with increased penicillin resistance were also isolated from wild-type strains of s. durans, s.  faecalis, and s. faecium. all of them carried a greater amount of the slow-reacting pbp than that carried by the parent. finally, it was found that resistant s. faecium atcc 9790 mutants grew normally in the presence of penicillin concentrations that were far above that saturating all pbps except pbp 5. cell growth was, on the contrary, inhibited by a penicillin concentration that saturated the slow-reacting pbp by 90%. this penicillin dose was equal to the minimal inhibitory concentration.

TI  == numerical taxonomy of streptococcus.
AB  == a numerical taxonomic study of strains of streptococcus, together with representatives of allied genera, showed 28 reasonably distinct phenons. the major areas, with their phenons, were: (a) enterococcal species group (s. faecalis, s. faecium, 's. avium' and a proposed new species 's. gallinarum'); (b) paraviridans species group (s. bovis, s. equinus, s. salivarius, 's. casseliflavus', s. mutans, s. raffinolactis and an unidentified oral group i); (c) lactic species group (s. lactis including s. cremoris); (d) thermophilic species group (s. thermophilus); (e) viridans species group (s. mitis, s. sanguis, a proposed new species 's. oralis' and 's. milleri'); (f) pyogenic species group (s. agalactiae, s. pyogenes, s. equi, 's. equisimilis' including 's. zooepidemicus, and a cluster of lancefield group b strains of human origin);  (g) parapyogenic species group (s. uberis, 's. dysgalactiae', and a cluster of strains of lancefield groups r, s and t). species of aerococcus, gemella, leuconostoc and pediococcus are very closely related to the streptococci.
