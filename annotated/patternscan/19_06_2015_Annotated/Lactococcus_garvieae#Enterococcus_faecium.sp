TI  == characterization, identification and application of lactic acid bacteria isolated from forage paddy rice silage.
AB  == there has been growing interest to develop forage rice as a new feed resource for livestock. this study was to characterize the natural population of lactic acid bacteria (lab) and select potentially excellent strains for paddy rice silage preparation in china. one hundred and twenty-six strains were isolated and screened from paddy rice silage prepared using a small-scale fermentation system, and ninety-nine of these isolates were considered to be lab based on their gram-positive and catalase-negative morphology and the production of most of their metabolic products as lactic acid. these isolates were divided into eight groups (a-h) on the basis of their morphological and biochemical characteristics. the group a to h strains were identified as lactobacillus (l.) plantarum subsp. plantarum (species ratio: 8.1%), l. casei (5.1%), leuconostoc (ln.) pseudomesenteroides (11.1%), pediococcus (p.) pentosaceus (24.2%), enterococcus (e.) mundtii (12.1%), lactococcus (lc.) garvieae (15.2%), e. faecium (9.1%) and lc. lactis subsp. lactis (15.2%) based on sequence analyses of their 16s rrna and reca genes. p. pentosaceus was the most abundant member of the lab population in  the paddy rice silage. a selected strain, namely l. casei r 465, was found to be  able to grow under low ph conditions and to improve the silage quality with low ph and a relatively high content of lactic acid. this study demonstrated that forage paddy rice silage contains abundant lab species and its silage can be well preserved by inoculation with lab, and that strain r 465 can be a potentially excellent inoculant for paddy rice silage.

TI  == microbial diversity and dynamics during the production of may bryndza cheese.
AB  == diversity and dynamics of microbial cultures were studied during the production of may bryndza cheese, a traditional slovak cheese produced from unpasteurized ewes' milk. quantitative culture-based data were obtained for lactobacilli, lactococci, total mesophilic aerobic counts, coliforms, e. coli, staphylococci, coagulase-positive staphylococci, yeasts, fungi and geotrichum spp. in ewes' milk, curd produced from it and ripened for 0 - 10 days, and in bryndza cheese produced from the curd, in three consecutive batches. diversity of prokaryotes and eukaryotes in selected stages of the production was studied by non-culture approach based on amplification of 16s rdna and internal transcribed spacer region, coupled to denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and sequencing. the culture-based data demonstrated an overall trend of growth of the microbial population contributing to lactic acid production and to ripening of the cheese,  lactobacilli, lactococci and geotrichum spp. growing up to densities of 10(8) cfu/g, 10(9) cfu/g and 10(5) cfu/g, respectively, in all three consecutive batches of bryndza cheese. the diversity of bacteria encompassed acinetobacter calcoaceticus, acinetobacter guillouiae, acinetobacter sp., acinetobacter johnsonii, citrobacter braakii, clostridium bartlettii, corynebacterium callunae, corynebacterium maris, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter asburiae, enterobacter hormaechei, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus pallens, escherichia  coli, haemophilus haemolyticus, hafnia alvei, kluyvera cryocrescens, lactobacillus helveticus, lactococcus garvieae, lc. lactis subsp. cremoris, lc. lactis subsp. lactis, "leuconostoc garlicum", mannheimia glucosida, mannheimia haemolytica, pseudomonas sp., ps. fluorescens, "ps. reactans", raoultella ornithinolytica, r. terrigena, "rothia arfidiae", staphylococcus aureus, staph. epidermidis, staph. felis, staph. pasteuri, staph. sciuri, staph. xylosus, streptococcus parauberis, str. thermophilus and variovorax paradoxus. the diversity of yeasts and fungi encompassed alternaria alternata, "ascomycete sp.", aspergillus fumigatus, beauveria brongniartii, candida xylopsoci, c. inconspicua, cladosporium cladosporioides, debaromyces hansenii, fomes fomentarius, galactomyces candidus, gymnoascus reesii, chaetomium globosum, kluyveromyces marxianus, metarhizium anisopliae, penicillium aurantiogriseum, p. camemberti, p. freii, p. polonicum, p. viridicatum, pichia kudriavzevii, sordaria alcina, trichosporon lactis and yarrowia lipolytica.

TI  == development of a selective and differential medium for capsulated lactococcus garvieae.
AB  == a selective and differential medium termed 'lg agar' was developed for the isolation and presumptive identification of lactococcus garvieae that results in  black colonies with red halos. in this study, all 14 strains of l. garvieae and only 9 of the 148 strains representing 38 other species were able to grow on the  lg agar. the nine viable strains on lg agar plates (including enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, lactococcus lactis, vibrio fluvialis, vibrio furnissii, vibrio mimicus and vibrio salmonicida) were further differentiated from l. garvieae by various colours or colony features. colonies isolated from the mixing culture and the infected giant sea perch using lg agar plates were all positively identified as l. garvieae by conventional tests and 16s rdna sequencing. furthermore, lg agar discriminated capsulated strains of l. garvieae, which were believed to be correlated with pathogens of fish and shellfish, from non-capsulated ones by colony appearances. the specificity and differentiating ability of lg agar suggest that this medium displays considerable potential for primary isolation and presumptive identification of l. garvieae from pathological and environmental samples.

TI  == screening and characterization of lab-produced bacteriocin-like substances from the intestine of grey mullet (mugil cephalus l.) as potential biocontrol agents in aquaculture.
AB  == aim: to isolate and characterize bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance (blis)-producing lactic acid bacteria from the intestine of grey mullet. methods  and results: inhibitory activity against at least one or more indicator strains was observed in one enterococcus thailandicus, one enterococcus faecium and two lactococcus garvieae strains. enterococcus faecium b3-8 and ent. thailandicus b3-22 showed the greatest inhibitory activities against listeria monocytogenes atcc 19111 and were therefore further characterized. the results suggested that the inhibitory substances from the two strains showed similar characteristics with respect to sensitivity to heat and proteolytic enzymes. blis from ent. thailandicus b3-22 was characterized by a broader inhibitory spectrum than that from ent. faecium b3-8. sds-page revealed that the molecular size of partially purified bliss from ent. faecium b3-8 and ent. thailandicus b3-22 was c. 5 and 3  kda, respectively. the molecular mass of purified bacteriocin from ent. thailandicus b3-22 was further determined to be 6319 da by matrix-assisted laser  desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms). the results indicated that blis from ent. thailandicus b3-22 can effectively inhibit  the growth of all tested l. garvieae strains. conclusions: the findings obtained  in this study suggest the potential use of ent. thailandicus b3-22 as a biocontrol agent against pathogenic l. garvieae in the aquaculture. significance  and impact of the study: this is the first report describing the characteristics  of blis from ent. thailandicus that showed potential for use as a biocontrol agent in the aquaculture.

TI  == effect of a probiotic strain, enterococcus faecium, on the immune responses of olive flounder (paralichthys olivaceus).
AB  == the present study was aimed to investigate the effect of a probiotic, enterococcus faecium, on the immune responses against infection with the marine fish pathogen lactococcus garvieae in olive flounder (paralichthys olivaceus). the immune responses were assessed by lysozyme activity, complement activity, protease activity, and expression of proinflammatory cytokines by rt-pcr. the lysozyme and complement activities were increased between 9 to 15 and 9 to 13 days, respectively, and antiprotease activity was slightly elevated after 5 days  of probiotic treatment. the tnf-alpha and il-1beta expressions were observed from kidney and spleen. the results of this study reveal that e. faecium induces immune-responsible materials and protects olive flounder from lactococcosis.

TI  == oxalate-degrading capacities of lactic acid bacteria in canine feces.
AB  == in this study, lactic acid bacteria in canine feces were isolated and identified, and their oxalate-degrading capacities were evaluated. the oxalate-degrading capacities were determined for 24 of 47 (51.06%) lactic acid bacteria isolates. of these, 8 isolates [leuconostoc mesenteroides (rl75), lactococcus garvieae (cd2), lactococcus subsp. lactis (cs21), enterococcus faecium (cl71 and cl72), and enterococcus faecalis (cd14, cs62, and cd12)] degraded more than 5% of the oxalate present, while the others degraded less than 5% of the oxalate in vitro.  isolates that degraded more than 5% of the oxalate present were selected for further examination. the oxalate-degrading capacities of individual isolates, a mixture of enterococcus, a mixture of lactococcus, and a mixture of the eight isolates were evaluated in media containing different concentrations of glucose (sufficient, insufficient, or no glucose). in comparison with the control medium, all of the individual isolates and mixtures of isolates could degrade oxalate in  all three groups (p<0.05). in most cases, the isolates growing in medium with 20  g/l of glucose had higher oxalate-degrading capacities than those growing in medium with 2.5 g/l of glucose or no glucose. the mixture of all isolates showed  higher oxalate-degrading capacity than the individual isolates and other mixtures. the oxalate-degrading capacities of the isolates were isolate dependent.

TI  == detection of human intestinal catalase-negative, gram-positive cocci by rrna-targeted reverse transcription-pcr.
AB  == an analytical system based on rrna-targeted reverse transcription-quantitative pcr (rt-qpcr) for enumeration of catalase-negative, gram-positive cocci was established. subgroup- or species-specific primer sets targeting 16s or 23s rrna  from enterococcus, streptococcus, and lactococcus were newly developed. the rt-qpcr method using these primers together with the previously reported primer sets specific for the enterococcus genus, the streptococcus genus, and several streptococcus species was found to be able to quantify the target populations with detection limits of 10(3) to 10(4) cells per gram feces, which was more than 100 times as sensitive as the qpcr method (10(6) to 10(8) cells per gram feces).  the rt-qpcr analysis of fecal samples from 24 healthy adult volunteers using the  genus-specific primer sets revealed that enterococcus and streptococcus were present as intestinal commensals at population levels of log(10) 6.2 +/- 1.4 and  7.5 +/- 0.9 per gram feces (mean +/- standard deviation [sd]), respectively. detailed investigation using species- or subgroup-specific primer sets revealed that the volunteers harbored unique enterococcus species, including the e. avium  subgroup, the e. faecium subgroup, e. faecalis, the e. casseliflavus subgroup, and e. caccae, while the dominant human intestinal streptococcus species was found to be s. salivarius. various lactococcus species, such as l. lactis subsp.  lactis or l. lactis subsp. cremoris, l. garvieae, l. piscium, and l. plantarum, were also detected but at a lower population level (log(10) 4.6 +/- 1.2 per gram  feces) and prevalence (33%). these results suggest that the rt-qpcr method enables the accurate and sensitive enumeration of human intestinal subdominant but still important populations, such as gram-positive cocci.

TI  == lactic acid bacteria as reducing and capping agent for the fast and efficient production of silver nanoparticles.
AB  == there is a growing demand for silver-based biocides, including both ionic silver  forms and metallic nanosilver. the use of metallic nanosilver, typically chemically produced, faces challenges including particle agglomeration, high costs, and upscaling difficulties . additionally, there exists a need for the development of a more eco-friendly production of nanosilver. in this study, gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria were utilized in the non-enzymatic production of silver nanoparticles via the interaction of silver ions and organic compounds present on the bacterial cell. only lactic acid bacteria, lactobacillus spp., pediococcus pentosaceus, enterococcus faecium, and lactococcus garvieae, were able to reduce silver. the nanoparticles of the five best producing lactobacillus spp. were examined more into detail with transmission electron microscopy. particle localization inside the cell, the mean particle size, and size distribution were species dependent, with lactobacillus fermentum having the smallest mean particle size of 11.2 nm, the most narrow size distribution, and most nanoparticles associated with the outside of the cells. furthermore, influence of ph on the reduction process was investigated. with increasing ph, silver recovery increased as well as the reduction rate as indicated by uv-vis analyses. this study demonstrated that lactobacillus spp. can be used for a rapid and efficient production of silver nanoparticles.

TI  == a survey of the lactic acid bacteria isolated from serbian artisanal dairy product kajmak.
AB  == kajmak is an artisanal serbian dairy product made by fermentation of milk fat. overall, 374 bacterial isolates were collected from six kajmak samples of different ages produced in the households located in distinct regions of serbia.  in order to identify lactic acid bacteria present in chosen samples of kajmak, total 349 gram-positive and catalase-negative isolates were analyzed. the recognition of isolates was performed by phenotypic characterization followed by  molecular identification using (gtg)(5)-pcr and sequence analysis of 16s rrna gene. leuconostoc mesenteroides and enterococcus faecium were the most frequently isolated species from kajmak samples. in contrast, leuconostocs and enterococci were found in bgmk3 and bgmk1 kajmak respectively, only after using enrichment technique for isolation suggesting they are present in low numbers in these kajmaks. lactococcus lactis, lactococcus raffinolactis and lactococcus garvieae were also found in those samples but in lower proportion. results showed that lactobacillus plantarum, lb. paracasei and lb. kefiri were the most frequently isolated lactobacillus species in analyzed kajmaks.

TI  == antimicrobial and safety aspects, and biotechnological potential of bacteriocinogenic enterococci isolated from mallard ducks (anas platyrhynchos).
AB  == samples from the intestinal content and carcasses of mallard ducks (anas platyrhynchos) were evaluated for enterococci with antimicrobial activity, presence of genes coding bacteriocins and their expression, and potential virulence factors. enterococcus faecalis comprised the largest enterococcal species with antagonistic activity followed by e. faecium, e. hirae, enterococcus spp., and the non-enterococci. although all e. faecalis isolates manifested a potent direct antimicrobial activity, no activity was detected in supernatants of most producer cultures. however, all e. faecium isolates showed antimicrobial activity in their supernatants and encoded bacteriocins, although the occurrence  in the isolates of several enterocin genes did not always correlate with a higher antagonistic activity in supernatants. the efaafm determinant was the only virulence gene detected in e. faecium, while e. faecalis showed a larger number of virulence determinants, and e. hirae did not carry any of the virulence genes  examined. the rapid identification of genes coding described bacteriocins permits recognition of isolates that are potentially producers of novel bacteriocins. purification of the antimicrobial activity of e. hirae dch5 and lactococcus garvieae dcc43 revealed unique chromatographic fragments after maldi-tof mass spectrometry analysis, suggesting the antagonistic peptides were purified to homogeneity. bacteriocinogenic e. faecium and e. hirae isolates may be considered hygienic for production of bacteriocins, and potentially safe due to their low incidence of potential virulence genes and susceptibility to most clinically relevant antibiotics. however, the presence among the enterococci of e. faecalis  strains with a potent antagonistic activity and multiple virulence factors, raises concerns regarding their potential pathogenicity to consumers.

TI  == diversity of lactic acid bacteria associated with fish and the fish farm environment, established by amplified rrna gene restriction analysis.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria have become a major source of concern for aquaculture in recent decades. in addition to true pathogenic species of worldwide significance, such as streptococcus iniae and lactococcus garvieae, several species have been reported to produce occasional fish mortalities in limited geographic areas, and  many unidentifiable or ill-defined isolates are regularly isolated from fish or fish products. to clarify the nature and prevalence of different fish-associated  bacteria belonging to the lactic acid bacterium group, a collection of 57 isolates of different origins was studied and compared with a set of 22 type strains, using amplified rrna gene restriction analysis (ardra). twelve distinct  clusters were delineated on the basis of ardra profiles and were confirmed by sequencing of soda and 16s rrna genes. these clusters included the following: lactococcus raffinolactis, l. garvieae, lactococcus l., s. iniae, s. dysgalactiae, s. parauberis, s. agalactiae, carnobacterium spp., the enterococcus "faecium" group, a heterogeneous enterococcus-like cluster comprising indiscernible representatives of vagococcus fluvialis or the recently recognized  v. carniphilus, v. salmoninarum, and aerococcus spp. interestingly, the l. lactis and l. raffinolactis clusters appeared to include many commensals of fish, so opportunistic infections caused by these species cannot be disregarded. the significance for fish populations and fish food processing of three or four genetic clusters of uncertain or complex definition, namely, aerococcus and enterococcus clusters, should be established more accurately.

TI  == application of single strand conformation polymorphism --pcr method for distinguishing cheese bacterial communities that inhibit listeria monocytogenes.
AB  == the aim of this study was to compare the microbial communities of different cheeses where listeria monocytogenes either grew or did not grow. for this purpose, (i) isolates from the most inhibitory cheese ecosystem were identified and their ability to produce anti-listeria substances was determined, (ii) bacterial communities of cheeses with and without l. monocytogenes growth were compared using the single strand conformation polymorphism method. the study showed sscp to be an effective tool for differentiating between the bacterial communities of different cheeses manufactured with the same technology. all the cheeses with the lowest l. monocytogenes counts on day 8 were distinguished by the dominance in their sscp profiles, after amplification of the v2 region of the 16s rrna gene, of 3 peaks whose nucleotide sequences comigrated with enterococcus faecium and enterococcus saccharominimus, chryseobacterium sp and corynebacterium flavescens, lactococcus garvieae and lactococcus lactis respectively. however, no anti-listeria compounds were produced under our experimental conditions. these six bacterial species were inoculated, separately or together, into pasteurised milk and their anti-listerial activity in cheese was evaluated. the area of inhibition between the control and trial curves confirmed that l. monocytogenes is inhibited by e. saccharominimus, c. flavescens, l. lactis, l. garvieae and the mixture of all six bacterial strains. further studies should be performed to determine the metabolites involved in l. monocytogenes inhibition.

TI  == classification and characterization of lactic acid bacteria isolated from the intestines of common carp and freshwater prawns.
AB  == fifty-four isolates of lactic acid bacteria were obtained from the intestines of  the common carp (cyprinus carpio) and freshwater prawns (macrobrachium rosenbergii) in nakorn-pathom province, thailand. all isolates were gram-positive and catalase-negative cocci that did not produce gas from glucose and formed dl or l(+) lactic acid only. most isolates were able to grow in broth at ph 9.6, in  6.5% nacl (w/v) and 40% (w/v) bile. these isolates were divided into six groups (a-f) by sugar fermentation patterns. strains in the groups a, b, c, and d showed intergroup dna homology values of above 73.8%, indicating that these groups were  composed of a single species. following phylogenetic analysis, strains e 1, e 7,  and e 26 from groups a, e, and f were placed in the clusters of the genera lactococcus, pediococcus, and enterococcus, respectively. the type strains of lactococcus garvieae, pediococcus acidilactici, and enterococcus faecium were the most closely related species with e 1, e 7, and e 26 in the phylogenetic tree, respectively. the dna-dna hybridization results indicated that strains in groups  a (including groups b, c, and d), e, and f could be identified as belonging to the species lactococcus garvieae, pediococcus acidilactici, and enterococcus faecium, respectively. lactococcus garvieae was the dominant member of the population, accounting for 90.7% of the isolates.

TI  == identification of enterococcus species and phenotypically similar lactococcus and vagococcus species by reverse checkerboard hybridization to chaperonin 60 gene sequences.
AB  == data from four recent studies (s. h. goh et al., j. clin. microbiol. 36:2164-2166, 1998; s. h. goh et al., j. clin. microbiol. 34:818-823, 1996; s. h. goh et al., j. clin. microbiol. 35:3116-3121, 1997; a. y. c. kwok et al., int. j. syst. bacteriol. 49:1181-1192, 1999) suggest that an approximately 600-bp region  of the chaperonin 60 (cpn60) gene, amplified by pcr with a single pair of degenerate primers, has utility as a potentially universal target for bacterial identification (id). this cpn60 gene id method correctly identified isolates representative of numerous staphylococcal species and streptococcus iniae, a human and animal pathogen. we report herein that this method enabled us to distinguish clearly between 17 enterococcus species (enterococcus asini, enterococcus rattus, enterococcus dispar, enterococcus gallinarum, enterococcus hirae, enterococcus durans, enterococcus cecorum, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus mundtii, enterococcus casseliflavus, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus malodoratus, enterococcus raffinosus, enterococcus avium, enterococcus pseudoavium, enterococcus new sp. strain facklam, and enterococcus saccharolyticus), and vagococcus fluvialis, lactococcus lactis, and lactococcus garvieae. from 123 blind-tested samples, only two discrepancies were observed between the facklam and collins phenotyping method (r. r. facklam and m. d. collins, j. clin. microbiol. 27:731-734, 1989) and the cpn60 id method. in each case, the discrepancies were resolved in favor of the cpn60 id method. the species distributions of the 123 blind-tested isolates were enterococcus new sp.  strain facklam (atcc 700913), 3; e. asini, 1; e. rattus, 4; e. dispar, 2; e. gallinarum, 20; e. hirae, 9; e. durans, 9; e. faecalis, 12; e. mundtii, 3; e. casseliflavus, 8; e. faecium, 25; e. malodoratus, 3; e. raffinosus, 8; e. avium,  4; e. pseudoavium, 1; an unknown enterococcus clinical isolate, sp. strain r871;  vagococcus fluvialis, 4; lactococcus garvieae, 3; lactococcus lactis, 3; leuconostoc sp., 1; and pediococcus sp., 1. the cpn60 gene id method, coupled with reverse checkerboard hybridization, is an effective method for the identification of enterococcus and related organisms.

TI  == use of tests for acidification of methyl-alpha-d-glucopyranoside and susceptibility to efrotomycin for differentiation of strains of enterococcus and  some related genera.
AB  == a total of 107 enterococcus strains, 10 vagococcus fluvialis strains, and 8 lactococcus garvieae strains were tested for acidification of methyl-alpha-d-glucopyranoside (mgp) and susceptibility to 100-microg efrotomycin (efro) disks. all 26 strains of enterococcus casseliflavus, including 3 nonmotile and 2 nonpigmented strains, acidified mgp and were resistant to efro. all 22 strains of enterococcus gallinarum, including 5 nonmotile strains, also acidified mgp and were resistant to efro. none of the 26 strains of enterococcus faecium acidified mgp, and all were susceptible to efro. although all 12 enterococcus faecalis strains were also negative in the mgp test, they were resistant to efro. other enterococcal strains gave variable results. all 10 strains of v. fluvialis  and all 8 strains of l. garvieae gave positive and negative results, respectively, in the mgp test and were, respectively, resistant and susceptible to efro. these results indicate that tests of the production of acid from mgp and susceptibility to efro can be used as adjunct tests in the identification of typical and atypical strains of enterococci in the clinical microbiology laboratory.
