TI  == effects of ensiling fermentation and aerobic deterioration on the bacterial community in italian ryegrass, guinea grass, and whole-crop maize silages stored  at high moisture content.
AB  == the effects of storage period and aerobic deterioration on the bacterial community were examined in italian ryegrass (ir), guinea grass (gg), and whole-crop maize (wm) silages. direct-cut forages were stored in a laboratory silo for 3, 7, 14, 28, 56, and 120 d without any additives; live counts, content  of fermentation products, and characteristics of the bacterial community were determined. 2,3-butanediol, acetic acid, and lactic acid were the dominant fermentation products in the ir, gg, and wm silages, respectively. the acetic acid content increased as a result of prolonged ensiling, regardless of the type  of silage crop, and the changes were distinctively visible from the beginning of  gg ensiling. pantoea agglomerans, rahnella aquatilis, and enterobacter sp. were the major bacteria in the ir silage, indicating that alcoholic fermentation may be due to the activity of enterobacteria. staphylococcus sciuri and bacillus pumilus were detected when ir silage was spoiled, whereas between aerobically stable and unstable silages, no differences were seen in the bacterial community  at silo opening. lactococcus lactis was a representative bacterium, although acetic acid was the major fermentation product in the gg silage. lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus brevis, and morganella morganii were suggested to be associated with the increase in acetic acid due to prolonged storage. enterobacter cloacae appeared when the gg silage was spoiled. in the wm silage, no distinctive changes due to prolonged ensiling were seen in the bacterial community. throughout the ensiling, weissella paramesenteroides, weissella confusa, and klebsiella pneumoniae were present in addition to l. plantarum, l. brevis, and l. lactis. upon deterioration, acetobacter pasteurianus, klebsiella variicola, enterobacter hormaechei, and bacillus gibsonii were detected. these results demonstrate the diverse bacterial community that evolves during ensiling  and aerobic spoilage of ir, gg, and wm silages.

TI  == effects of wilting and molasses addition on fermentation and bacterial community  in guinea grass silage.
AB  == aims: acetic acid is considered an important preservative in tropical grass ensiling. the objective of the current experiments was to follow the ensiling fermentation of low dry matter (dm) tropical grass as a model to study changes in bacterial communities during acetic acid fermentation. methods and results: direct-cut and wilted guinea grass silage was prepared with and without molasses. a high acetic acid level was observed during the fermentation of direct-cut silage, and long storage increased the butyric acid and ethanol content if molasses was not added. the lactic acid production in wilted silage was greater than the acetic acid production, but prolonged ensiling decreased the lactic to acetic acid ratio regardless of molasses addition. adding molasses enhanced the lactic acid content in both direct-cut and wilted silage. the bacterial community, identified by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, was affected by wilting and molasses addition. bands for pantoea sp. and morganella sp. became faint when acetic acid fermentation was suppressed, and those for pediococcus pentosaceus and lactococcus garvieae were detected when lactic acid fermentation  was enhanced by wilting and molasses addition. lactobacillus plantarum and lactococcus lactis were found throughout the ensiling process in all silage types. conclusion: distinct changes occurred in the bacterial community in guinea grass silage because of wilting and molasses addition. these changes could explain how lactic acid fermentation was enhanced but could not help determine which bacteria were associated with enhanced acetic acid fermentation. significance and impact of the study: the study reveals the effects of wilting and molasses during ensiling of low dm tropical grasses and the associated bacteria.

TI  == a multiphasic approach for the identification of endophytic bacterial in strawberry fruit and their potential for plant growth promotion.
AB  == this study used a multiphasic approach, characterized by the simultaneous use of  culture-dependent and culture-independent methods, to investigate endophytic bacterial communities in strawberry (fragaria ananassa) fruit. a total of 92 bacterial endophytes were isolated and initially grouped by their repetitive extragenic palindromic (rep)-pcr banding pattern and biochemical features. phylogenetic analysis of the 16s rrna gene sequences of 45 representatives showed that the isolates belonged to the species bacillus subtilis (eight isolates), bacillus sp. (seven isolates), enterobacter sp. (seven isolates), enterobacter ludwigii (six isolates), lactobacillus plantarum (six isolates), pseudomonas sp.  (five isolates), pantoea punctata (three isolates), and curtobacterium citreum (three isolates). nucleic acids were extracted from the strawberry fruit and subjected to 16s rrna gene directed polymerase chain reaction denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (16s rrna pcr-dgge). the species b. subtilis, enterobacter sp., and pseudomonas sp. were detected both by isolation and dgge. the dgge fingerprints of total bacterial dna did not exhibit bands corresponding to several of the representative species isolated in the extinction dilution (l. plantarum, c. citreum, and p. punctata). in contrast, bands in the dgge profile that were identified as relatives of arthrobacter sp. and one uncultivable erythrobacter sp. were not recovered by cultivation techniques. after isolation,  the nitrogen fixation ability and the in vitro production of indole-3-acetic acid (iaa) equivalents and siderophores were evaluated. a high percentage of isolates  were found to possess the ability to produce siderophores and iaa equivalents; however, only a few isolates belonging to the genera pseudomonas and enterobacter showed the ability to fix nitrogen. plant growth promotion was evaluated under greenhouse conditions and revealed the ability of the bacillus strains to enhance the number of leaves, shoot length, root dry weight, and shoot dry weight. the activity of the bacterial isolate identified as b. subtilis na-108 exerted the greatest influence on strawberry growth and showed a 42.8% increase in number of  leaves, 15.26% for high shoot, 43.5% increase in root dry weight, and a 77% increase in shoot dry weight when compared with untreated controls.

TI  == comparison of the bacterial species diversity of spontaneous cocoa bean fermentations carried out at selected farms in ivory coast and brazil.
AB  == to compare the spontaneous cocoa bean fermentation process carried out in different cocoa-producing regions, heap and box (one ivorian farm) and box (two brazilian farms) fermentations were carried out. all fermentations were studied through a multiphasic approach. in general, the temperature inside the fermenting mass increased throughout all fermentations and reached end-values of 42-48 degrees c. the main end-products of pulp carbohydrate catabolism were ethanol, lactic acid, acetic acid, and/or mannitol. in the case of the fermentations on the selected ivorian farm, the species diversity of lactic acid bacteria (lab) and acetic acid bacteria (aab) was restricted. lactobacillus fermentum and leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides were the predominant lab species, due to their ethanol and acid tolerance and citrate consumption. the levels of mannitol, ascribed to growth of l. fermentum, were fermentation-dependent. also, enterobacterial species, such as erwinia soli and pantoea sp., were among the predominating microbiota during the early stages of both heap and box fermentations in ivory coast, which could be responsible for gluconic acid production. consumption of gluconic acid at the initial phases of the ivorian fermentations could be due to yeast growth. a wider microbial species diversity throughout the fermentation process was seen in the case of the box fermentations on the selected brazilian farms, which differed, amongst other factors, regarding pod/bean selection on these farms as compared to fermentations on the selected ivorian farm. this microbiota included lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus durianis, l. fermentum, lactobacillus mali, lactobacillus nagelii, l. pseudomesenteroides, and pediococcus acidilactici, as well as bacillus subtilis that was present at late fermentation, when the temperature inside the fermenting mass reached values higher than 50 degrees c. moreover, aab seemed to dominate the brazilian box fermentations studied, explaining higher acetic acid concentrations in the pulp and the beans. to conclude, it turned out that the species diversity and community dynamics, influenced by local operational practices, in particular pod/bean selection, impact the quality of fermented cocoa beans.

TI  == bacterial species associated with sound and botrytis-infected grapes from a greek vineyard.
AB  == grape bacterial microbiota plays central roles in the quality of grapes and wine, yet its diversity remains poorly described. in the present study, bacterial species associated with sound and botrytis-infected grapes of two cultivars originating from the same vineyard were assessed. isolates were identified by pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge) and sequence analysis of partial 16s rrna gene. comparable counts were recorded between botrytis-infected  and sound grape samples. in all cases, the majority of isolates belonged to different species of enterobacteriaceae. the dominant species in the vineyard was klebsiella oxytoca that was found in different combinations with citrobacter freundii, enterobacter spp., erwinia sp., pantoea dispersa, tatumella ptyseos or  other species. in fermenting musts, those populations declined while other species evolved, like lactobacillus plantarum and enterobacter ludwigii. populations in botrytised samples persisted longer during spontaneous fermentations. present study suggests that bacterial diversity on grapes may be wider than previously described.

TI  == taxonomic structure and stability of the bacterial community in belgian sourdough ecosystems as assessed by culture and population fingerprinting.
AB  == a total of 39 traditional sourdoughs were sampled at 11 bakeries located throughout belgium which were visited twice with a 1-year interval. the taxonomic structure and stability of the bacterial communities occurring in these traditional sourdoughs were assessed using both culture-dependent and culture-independent methods. a total of 1,194 potential lactic acid bacterium (lab) isolates were tentatively grouped and identified by repetitive element sequence-based pcr, followed by sequence-based identification using 16s rrna and  phes genes from a selection of genotypically unique lab isolates. in parallel, all samples were analyzed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) of v3-16s rrna gene amplicons. in addition, extensive metabolite target analysis of  more than 100 different compounds was performed. both culturing and dgge analysis showed that the species lactobacillus sanfranciscensis, lactobacillus paralimentarius, lactobacillus plantarum, and lactobacillus pontis dominated the  lab population of belgian type i sourdoughs. in addition, dgge band sequence analysis demonstrated the presence of acetobacter sp. and a member of the erwinia/enterobacter/pantoea group in some samples. overall, the culture-dependent and culture-independent approaches each exhibited intrinsic limitations in assessing bacterial lab diversity in belgian sourdoughs. irrespective of the lab biodiversity, a large majority of the sugar and amino acid metabolites were detected in all sourdough samples. principal component-based analysis of biodiversity and metabolic data revealed only little  variation among the two samples of the sourdoughs produced at the same bakery. the rare cases of instability observed could generally be linked with variations  in technological parameters or differences in detection capacity between culture-dependent and culture-independent approaches. within a sampling interval  of 1 year, this study reinforces previous observations that the bakery environment rather than the type or batch of flour largely determines the development of a stable lab population in sourdoughs.
