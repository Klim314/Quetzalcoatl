TI  - Classification, identification, and clinical significance of haemophilus and aggregatibacter species with host specificity for humans.
AB  - The aim of this review is to provide a comprehensive update on the current classification and identification of Haemophilus and Aggregatibacter species with exclusive or predominant host specificity for humans. Haemophilus influenzae and some of the other Haemophilus species are commonly encountered in the clinical microbiology laboratory and demonstrate a wide range of pathogenicity, from life-threatening invasive disease to respiratory infections to a nonpathogenic, commensal lifestyle. New species of Haemophilus have been described (Haemophilus pittmaniae and Haemophilus sputorum), and the new genus Aggregatibacter was created to accommodate some former Haemophilus and Actinobacillus species (Aggregatibacter aphrophilus, Aggregatibacter segnis, and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans). Aggregatibacter species are now a dominant etiology of infective endocarditis caused by fastidious organisms (HACEK endocarditis), and A. aphrophilus has emerged as an important cause of brain abscesses. Correct identification of Haemophilus and Aggregatibacter species based on phenotypic characterization can be challenging. It has become clear that 15 to 20% of presumptive H. influenzae isolates from the respiratory tracts of healthy individuals do not belong to this species but represent nonhemolytic variants of Haemophilus haemolyticus. Due to the limited pathogenicity of H. haemolyticus, the proportion of misidentified strains may be lower in clinical samples, but even among invasive strains, a misidentification rate of 0.5 to 2% can be found. Several methods have been investigated for differentiation of H. influenzae from its less pathogenic relatives, but a simple method for reliable discrimination is not available. With the implementation of identification by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry, the more rarely encountered species of Haemophilus and Aggregatibacter will increasingly be identified in clinical microbiology practice. However, identification of some strains will still be problematic, necessitating DNA sequencing of multiple housekeeping gene fragments or full-length 16S rRNA genes.
TI  - Association between HACEK bacteraemia and endocarditis.
AB  - We retrospectively examined medical records of 87 patients with bacteraemia caused by members of the HACEK group (Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Aggregatibacter aphrophilus, Aggregatibacter paraphrophilus, Cardiobacterium spp., Eikenella corrodens and Kingella spp.) to determine whether endocarditis was present, as defined by the Duke criteria. The overall positive predictive value (PPV) of HACEK bacteraemia for endocarditis was 60 %. The PPV varied with different HACEK species from 0 % (E. corrodens) to 100 % (A. actinomycetemcomitans).
TI  - Kingella kingae endocarditis: A rare case of mitral valve perforation.
AB  - Kingella kingae, a HACEK (Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Aggregatibacter aphrophilus, Cardiobacterium hominis, Eikenella corrodens, Kingella kingae) organism, is a common resident of the upper airway in children; it has been associated with endocarditis in children with pre-existing heart conditions. This case report describes K. kingae endocarditis leading to valvular damage in a previously healthy 18-month-old child. Our patient developed a K. kingae bacteremia that was later complicated by meningitis, septic embolic stroke, and endocarditis of the mitral valve, leading to perforation of the posterolateral leaflet. The patient was initially treated conservatively with cefotaxime but, subsequently, required a mitral valve repair with a pericardial patch and annuloplasty. This report draws attention to the need for clinicians to be aware of the potentially serious complications of K. kingae infection in young children. If K. kingae infection is suspected then therapy should be initiated promptly with a beta-lactam, followed by early echocardiographic assessment. This case also highlights the lack of specific guidelines available for K. kingae endocarditis.
TI  - Isolation of Aggregatibacter aphrophilus from a patient with acute appendicitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Acute appendicitis is a common surgical emergency. The etiology and pathophysiology of appendicitis have been well investigated. Aggregatibacter aphrophilus is a fastidious gram-negative coccobacilli. Detection of this organism in clinical samples and its differentiation from Haemophilus aphrophilus or from Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans in routine microbiology settings could be difficult. METHODS: In this rare case, we report the isolation of Aggregatibacter aphrophilus from the appendix of a 14-year-old boy presented with acute appendicitis. The genotypic method using 16S rRNA sequencing was used for identification of the organism at species level. CONCLUSION: This case highlights the importance of detecting fastidious and rare microorganisms such as Aggregatibacter aphrophilus that could be associated with acute appendicitis.
TI  - Identification of HACEK clinical isolates by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry.
AB  - Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry is a rapid and accurate tool for the identification of many microorganisms. We assessed this technology for the identification of 103 Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Aggregatibacter aphrophilus, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Cardiobacterium hominis, Eikenella corrodens, and Kingella kingae (HACEK) clinical isolates and 20 Haemophilus influenzae clinical isolates. Ninety-three percent of HACEK organisms were identified correctly to the genus level using the Bruker database, and 100% were identified to the genus level using a custom database that included clinical isolates.
TI  - [Endocarditis due to Aggregatibacter (formerly: Actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans, a bacterium that grows in characteristic star-shaped colonies].
AB  - A 72-year-old man, having had an artificial valve for almost 20 years now, presented with tiredness that had persisted for several weeks and reported weight loss of 5 kg. In more recent days he experienced fever and cold shivers, and an associated dry cough. Bearing in mind the potential for endocarditis, blood cultures were grown. In this, we identified a small, Gram-negative rod with a small, smooth, raised colony that grew slowly. We considered a micro-organism from the 'HACEK group', which is a group of micro-organisms including Haemophilus aphrophilus, Haemophilus paraphrophilus, Cardiobacterium hominis, Eikenella corrodens, Kingella kingae and Aggregatibacter (formerly: Actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans. More careful observation revealed that the bacteria formed star-shaped colonies, proving that A. actinomycetemcomitans was the cause of this non-acute endocarditis. The patient received antibiotic treatment. Because non-acute endocarditis is often caused by hidden abnormalities in the mouth or teeth and A. actinomycetemcomitans plays an important role in severe cases of peridontitis, a dental surgeon was consulted. The dental surgeon diagnosed multifocal peridontitis and treated the patient, who was able to leave the hospital after 6 weeks of antibiotic treatment.
TI  - Reclassification of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Haemophilus aphrophilus, Haemophilus paraphrophilus and Haemophilus segnis as Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans gen. nov., comb. nov., Aggregatibacter aphrophilus comb. nov. and Aggregatibacter segnis comb. nov., and emended description of Aggregatibacter aphrophilus to include V factor-dependent and V factor-independent isolates.
AB  - The aim of this study was to reinvestigate the relationships and the generic affiliations of the species Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Haemophilus aphrophilus, Haemophilus paraphrophilus and Haemophilus segnis. The nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase gene (nadV) conferring V factor-independent growth was identified in Haemophilus aphrophilus. The gene encodes a polypeptide of 462 amino acids that shows 74.5 % amino acid sequence identity to the corresponding enzyme from Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. Ten isolates of Haemophilus paraphrophilus all carried a nadV pseudogene. DNA from Haemophilus aphrophilus was able to transform Haemophilus paraphrophilus into the NAD-independent phenotype. The transformants carried a full-length nadV inserted in the former locus of the pseudogene. The DNA-DNA relatedness between the type strains of Haemophilus aphrophilus and Haemophilus paraphrophilus was 77 %. We conclude that the division into two species Haemophilus aphrophilus and Haemophilus paraphrophilus is not justified and that Haemophilus paraphrophilus should be considered a later heterotypic synonym of Haemophilus aphrophilus. Forty strains of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Haemophilus aphrophilus and Haemophilus segnis were investigated by multilocus sequence analysis. The 40 strains form a monophyletic group clearly separate from other evolutionary lineages of the family Pasteurellaceae. We propose the transfer of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Haemophilus aphrophilus and Haemophilus segnis to a new genus Aggregatibacter gen. nov. as Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans comb. nov. (the type species; type strain ATCC 33384(T)=CCUG 13227(T)=CIP 52.106(T)=DSM 8324(T)=NCTC 9710(T)), Aggregatibacter aphrophilus comb. nov. (type strain ATCC 33389(T)=CCUG 3715(T)=CIP 70.73(T)=NCTC 5906(T)) and Aggregatibacter segnis comb. nov. (type strain HK316(T)=ATCC 33393(T)=CCUG 10787(T)=CCUG 12838(T)=CIP 103292(T)=NCTC 10977(T)). The species of the genus Aggregatibacter are independent of X factor and variably dependent on V factor for growth in vitro.
TI  - Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Haemophilus aphrophilus in systemic and  nonoral infections in Finland.
AB  - The oral cavity is the ecological niche for Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans  and Haemophilus aphrophilus, but occasionally they cause severe nonoral infections. In this study we present 20 systemic or nonoral infections due to A. actinomycetemcomitans and H. aphrophilus, comprising all isolates of these species forwarded to and stored in Finnish reference laboratories during the years 1988-2000. The time from specimen collection to correct species identification was 9.3 days for A. actinomycetemcomitans and 10.7 days for H. aphrophilus. A. actinomycetemcomitans strains represented serotypes a, b, c, and d. Arbitrarily primed PCR distinguished four A. actinomycetemcomitans and six H. aphrophilus genotypes. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing with benzylpenicillin, amoxicillin, tetracycline, metronidazole, azithromycin, and trovafloxacin showed generally good activities against the present strains, and the susceptibility patterns closely resembled those of oral strains. The prolonged time to recover and identify A. actinomycetemcomitans and H. aphrophilus from systemic and nonoral infections may delay the correct diagnosis of the patient, but the good antimicrobial efficacies of antimicrobial agents against these pathogens give a good prognosis for the patients and advance the treatment of severe infections caused by these fastidious organisms of oral origin.
TI  - Bilateral endogenous endophthalmitis caused by HACEK microorganism.
AB  - PURPOSE: To report a case of bilateral endogenous endophthalmitis caused by a HACEK group organism (Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans). METHODS: An 85-year-old Caucasian female presented with bilateral light perception visual acuity, anterior chamber cells, hypopyon, posterior synechiae, and no red reflex. RESULTS: The patient underwent bilateral vitrectomy, with topical, intravitreal, and systemic antibiotics. Vitreous cultures revealed gram-negative cocco bacilli consistent with Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. At final follow-up, visual acuity was 20/25 RE and 20/40 LE. CONCLUSIONS: Prompt diagnosis and treatment of HACEK [Hemophilus sp. (parainfluenzae, aphrophilus, paraphrophilus), Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Cardiobacterium hominis, Eikenella corodens, and Kingella kingae] group bacterial endophthalmitis can yield good results.
TI  - Phosphorylcholine-dependent cross-reactivity between dental plaque bacteria and oxidized low-density lipoproteins.
AB  - Antibodies reactive with phosphorylcholine (PC) are ubiquitous in human sera, but the antigens stimulating their production and their function are not clear. Previous studies have shown that a significant proportion of dental plaque bacteria contain PC as determined by reactivity with PC-specific mouse myeloma proteins and monoclonal antibodies. Additionally, serum antibody concentrations of immunoglobulin (IgG) G anti-PC are higher in sera of individuals who have experienced periodontal attachment loss than those who are periodontally healthy. These data implicate the oral microflora as a source of antigen-stimulating anti-PC responses. Recent data also indicate that antibodies with specificity for PC are elevated in ApoE-deficient mice, a model for studies of athersclerosis, and that such antibodies bound oxidized low-density lipoproteins (LDL) (oxLDL) in atherosclerotic plaques. These data prompted the hypothesis that human anti-PC could bind to both oral bacteria and human oxLDL, and that these antigens are cross-reactive. We therefore examined the ability of human anti-PC to bind to PC-bearing strains of oral bacteria using enzyme-linked immunosorbent inhibition assays and by assessment of direct binding of affinity-purified human anti-PC to PC-bearing Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. Our results indicated that PC-bearing strains of Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus sanguis, Haemophilus aphrophilus, Actinomyces naeslundii, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and A. actinomycetemcomitans, as well as a strain of Streptococcus pneumoniae, absorbed up to 80% of anti-PC IgG antibody from human sera. Furthermore, purified anti-PC bound to a PC-bearing strain of A. actinomycetemcomitans but only poorly to a PC-negative strain. OxLDL also absorbed anti-PC from human sera, and oxLDL but not LDL reacted with up to 80% of the anti-PC in human sera. Furthermore, purified anti-PC bound directly to oxLDL but not to LDL. The data indicate that PC-containing antigens on a variety of common oral bacteria are cross-reactive with neoantigens expressed in oxLDL. We propose that PC-bearing dental plaque microorganisms may induce an antibody response to PC that could influence the inflammatory response associated with atherosclerosis.
TI  - Microtubules are associated with intracellular movement and spread of the periodontopathogen Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  - Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans SUNY 465, the invasion prototype strain, enters epithelial cells by an actin-dependent mechanism, escapes from the host cell vacuole, and spreads intracellularly and to adjacent epithelial cells via intercellular protrusions. Internalized organisms also egress from host cells into the assay medium via protrusions that are associated with just a single epithelial cell. Here we demonstrate that agents which inhibit microtubule polymerization (e.g., colchicine) and those which stabilize polymerized microtubules (e.g., taxol) both increase markedly the number of intracellular A. actinomycetemcomitans organisms. Furthermore, both colchicine and taxol prevented the egression of A. actinomycetemcomitans from host cells into the assay medium. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that protrusions that mediate the bacterial spread contain microtubules. A. actinomycetemcomitans SUNY 465 and 652, strains that are both invasive and egressive, interacted specifically with the plus ends (growing ends) of the filaments of microtubule asters in a KB cell extract. By contrast, neither A. actinomycetemcomitans 523, a strain that is invasive but not egressive, nor Haemophilus aphrophilus, a noninvasive oral bacterium with characteristics similar to those of A. actinomycetemcomitans, bound to microtubules. Together these data suggest that microtubules function in the spread and movement of A. actinomycetemcomitans and provide the first evidence that host cell dispersion of an invasive bacterium may involve the usurption of host cell microtubules.
TI  - Evaluation of two commercial kits and arbitrarily primed PCR for identification and differentiation of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Haemophilus aphrophilus, and Haemophilus paraphrophilus.
AB  - The closely related species Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Haemophilus aphrophilus, and Haemophilus paraphrophilus are common findings in oral microbiota. The aims of this study were to evaluate the applicability of the Rapid NH and API ZYM kits and arbitrarily primed PCR (AP-PCR) in the identification and differentiation of the three species from each other. The material included 62 clinical isolates and three reference strains of A. actinomycetemcomitans representing the 5 serotypes and 18 AP-PCR genotypes. Haemophilus species included 12 clinical isolates and 11 reference strains of H. aphrophilus, H. paraphrophilus, and 5 other species. For the PCR amplification, the oligonucleotide 5'-CAGCACCCAC-3' was used as a primer. Contrary to the consistent performance of API ZYM, the Rapid NH system was able to identify only 10 of 65 (15%) A. actinomycetemcomitans isolates, whereas all Haemophilus species were correctly identified. The API ZYM test differentiated A. actinomycetemcomitans from H. aphrophilus and H. paraphrophilus by negative beta-galactosidase and alpha-glucosidase reactions and a positive esterase lipase reaction. However, the API ZYM test was unable to differentiate H. aphrophilus from H. paraphrophilus, it also could not differentiate A. actinomycetemcomitans serotypes from each other. Among the H. aphrophilus isolates three AP-PCR genotypes and among H. paraphrophilus isolates only one AP-PCR genotype, distinct from those of A. actinomycetemcomitans, were found. The Rapid NH test showed poor ability to identify clinical isolates of all A. actinomycetemcomitans serotypes. Moreover, AP-PCR genotyping proved to be a rapid method for the species differentiation of A. actinomycetemcomitans, H. aphrophilus, and H. paraphrophilus.
TI  - Epithelial cell invasion by Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans strains from restriction fragment-length polymorphism groups associated with juvenile periodontitis or carrier status.
AB  - The epithelial cell invasiveness of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans strains  of different restriction fragment-length polymorphism (RFLP) groups associated with disease conversion and asymptomatic carrier status in localized juvenile periodontitis was examined. Twenty clinical isolates were studied for their ability to invade KB monolayers, using the quantitative gentamicin killing assay. Five isolates were found to be invasive, five were not invasive; and the other 10 did not invade better than an invasion negative control Haemophilus aphrophilus strain ATCC 19415. Using probe-specific DNA fingerprinting. 11 strains were assigned to RFLP group II (disease-associated); 4 to RFLP type XIII (carrier status associated); and the other to groups III, IV, V and VII. Eight isolates, all RFLP group II, were leukotoxin producers as determined by PCR amplification of the lkt promoter region. No correlation was found between invasiveness and RFLP group. Leukotoxin production was more associated with noninvasive than invasive strains.
TI  - Serum antibodies reacting with subgingival species in refractory periodontitis subjects.
AB  - The purpose of this investigation was to compare the levels of serum IgG antibody to 85 subgingival species in 32 refractory periodontitis, 56 successfully treated, and 33 periodontally healthy subjects. Refractory subjects showed mean full mouth attachment loss and/or >3 sites showing attachment loss >2.5 mm within 1 year after 2 treatment modalities, scaling and root planing and surgery plus systemically administered tetracycline. Successfully-treated subjects showed mean attachment level gain and no sites with attachment loss >2.5 mm, 1 year post-therapy. Periodontally healthy subjects exhibited no pocket or attachment level >3 mm, and no evidence of progressing attachment loss during 1 year of monitoring. Baseline serum was obtained from each subject and tested against 85 subgingival species, including reference strains and strains isolated from refractory subjects, using checkerboard immunoblotting. Significance of differences in levels of serum antibody among groups were sought using the Kruskal-Wallis test. Refractory subjects constituted a heterogeneous group based on their serum antibody response to subgingival species. Some individuals had antibody reactions to many subgingival species, while other subjects showed fewer or low numbers of responses. On average, refractory subjects exhibited higher numbers and levels of serum antibody reactions to a wide range of subgingival species than successfully treated or periodontally healthy subjects. Differences in serum antibody among clinical groups were more striking at higher threshold levels of antibody (>50 microg/ml and > 100 microg/ml). The data showed that a subject was 10.1 x more likely to be refractory if the subject exhibited antibody reactions with >9 subgingival species at >50 microg/ml (p<0.001, after adjusting for multiple comparisons). Serum antibody to a subset of the test species differed among the clinical groups. Porphyromonas gingivalis, Bacteroidesforsythus, and some strains isolated from refractory subjects (a novel Neisseria sp., Enterococcus faecalis, Prevotella loescheii and Prevotella oulora) elicited high serum antibody in the successfully treated and refractory subjects. High levels of serum antibody to a Microbacterium lacticum-like organism, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus constellatus, Actinobacillus actinonmycetemcomitans serotype c and Haemophilus aphrophilus significantly increased the likelihood of a subject being refractory to conventional periodontal therapy.
TI  - Rapid identification of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Haemophilus aphrophilus, and Haemophilus paraphrophilus by restriction enzyme analysis of PCR-amplified 16S rRNA genes.
AB  - Restriction enzyme analysis of PCR-amplified 16S rRNA genes was used to distinguish among clinical isolates of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Haemophilus aphrophilus, and Haemophilus paraphrophilus which were originally identified by conventional phenotypic methods. This PCR-based method is a reliable and rapid alternative to conventional methods for identification of these bacterial species.
TI  - Myeloperoxidase isoform activities released by human neutrophils in response to dental and periodontal bacteria.
AB  - Myeloperoxidase is an enzyme released by polymorphonuclear leukocytes which has been used, experimentally, as an indicator of periodontal disease activity when measured in gingival crevicular fluid. There are three myeloperoxidase isoforms: MPO I, MPO II and MPO III. We examined the activities of myeloperoxidase isoforms released by neutrophils in response to serum-opsonized Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Haemophilus aphrophilus, Eikenella corrodens, Capnocytophaga sputigena and Streptococcus sanguis. Isoform activities were determined using intermediate-pressure liquid chromatography and microenzyme assay. A. actinomycetemcomitans stimulated higher levels of myeloperoxidase release than any other oral bacteria unless pre-opsonized with serum (or protein-A-purified immunoglobulin) from an individual with localized juvenile periodontitis. Most oral bacteria stimulated the release of all myeloperoxidase isoforms with a profile enriched in MPO I and diminished in MPO III. Exceptionally, serum-opsonized A. actinomycetemcomitans stimulated myeloperoxidase isoform release in proportion to the neutrophil granule constituency with or without localized juvenile periodontitis serum pre-opsonization. Because myeloperoxidase isoform profiles reflect how neutrophils were stimulated, isoform analysis may refine future diagnostic tests based upon myeloperoxidase.
TI  - Novel FNR homologues identified in four representative oral facultative anaerobes: Capnocytophaga ochracea, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Haemophilus aphrophilus, and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  - Based upon DNA sequence data and positive immunochemical reactivity of expressed  protein, novel homologues of the FNR family were identified in four representative oral facultative anaerobes: Capnocytophaga ochracea, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Haemophilus aphrophilus, and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. The similarity to E. coli FNR and to HlyX (itself 71% similar to E. coli FNR, while regulating expression of hemolysin operon in Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae) was estimated from the deduced partial amino acid sequence to be, in the above order of tested species, 98, 98, 86, and 85%, and 75, 75, 88, and 88%, respectively. The phylogenetic relatedness indicates a rather closer link of HlyX to the FNR homologues from both pathogens, H. aphrophilus and A. actinomycetemcomitans. The possibility that the A. actinomycetemcomitans FNR homologue functions as a redox-sensing transcriptional factor to regulate, in addition to anaerobic respiration, microaerobic expression of the leukotoxin operon (ltx gene) is suggested.
TI  - PCR primers for the amplification of the 16S rRNA gene of oral bacteria and for the specific identification of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  - The aim of this study was to develop a PCR reaction specific to Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, which targets a widely conserved gene of this bacterium. Two sets of primers were designed based on published sequences of the 16S rRNA of several microorganisms. The first set amplifies a major part of the 16S small subunit rRNA gene of several strains of bacteria commonly found in the periodontal pocket. This reaction produced a 1306 bp-long product and served as a positive control. The second set was specific to A. actinomycetemcomitans and produced a 449 bp-long product. H. aphrophilus and E. coli yielded positive results with the control primers and negative results with the A. actinomycetemcomitans-specific primers. DNA-DNA hybridization was used to validate the identify of the amplified sequences. B. cereus, which is a common contaminator in the laboratory, and human DNA did not generate PCR products in either reaction. The developed primers seen useful for the identification of A. actinomycetemcomitans strains.
TI  - Molecular and immunological characterization of a 64-kDa protein of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  - The 64-kDa protein to which about half the sera from patients with localized juvenile periodontitis and rapidly progressive periodontitis reacted strongly was purified from Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans Y4. Determination of the N-terminal sequence of the protein revealed that it was a GroEL-like protein. The DNA fragment containing the groEL gene of A. actinomycetemcomitans was amplified by polymerase chain reaction, and the groESL operon was cloned by using colony hybridization with the amplified fragment from A. actinomycetemcomitans chromosomal DNA. Sequence analysis revealed that structures of the operon and its products were typical in gram-negative bacteria. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to the 64-kDa protein cross-reacted with approximately 65-kDa proteins of Haemophilus aphrophilus, Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus paraphrophilus, Escherichia coli and Eikenella corrodens but not with any cellular proteins of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia and Fusobacterium nucleatum. It is possible that antibodies reactive to the 64-kDa protein in periodontitis patients are induced by the cross-reactivity with the hsp60 proteins of other bacteria.
TI  - Use of a nonradioactive genetic probe identified, synthesized, and labeled in the polymerase chain reaction.
AB  - This study introduces a strategy to identify and produce sequences useful as genetic markers, or native genetic probes for DNA-DNA hybridization in bacterial strains where the genetics is not well described. Actinobacillus actinomy-cetemcomitans (A.a.) was used as an example. Fifty ng genomic DNA from A.a. ATCC 33384 and Haemophilus aphrophilus ATCC 33389 was amplified in a thermocycler using a single 10-mer primer. The PCR products were separated by electrophoresis on a 1% submarine agarose gel containing ethidium bromide and visualized by UV illumination, and the strain-specific amplitypes were compared. DNA from two bands, 0.9 and 4 kb, unique for the A.a. strain, was cut out, amplified under high stringency with the same primer and labeled by replacing 33.3 microM dTTP with digoxigenin-labeled dUTP in the reaction mixture. The labeled probe was then repeatedly used for hybridization to DNA from various A.a., H. aphrophilus, and other bacterial strains of the Pasteurellaceae family. The results showed that the 0.9-kb probe detected all A.a. tested, and distinguished it from other closely related bacterial species. We conclude that the described strategy is useful for identifying and selecting genetic sequences useful as genetic markers in A.a.
TI  - Polymorphonuclear leukocyte chemiluminescence induced by Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Haemophilus aphrophilus in serum and saliva.
AB  - The ability of different strains of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (A.a.) and Haemophilus aphrophilus (H.a.) to trigger activation of an oxidative burst in human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNL) was examined by measuring the luminol-amplified light emission--chemiluminescence (CL)--from these cells. Bacterial cells were incubated with PMNL from one healthy subject, in the presence of either active serum, heat-inactivated serum, saliva, or saliva and active serum. In the presence of active serum, all five H.a. strains and two out of five A.a. strains triggered a CL response. The CL induced in the presence of heat-inactivated serum was considerably less than that achieved with fresh serum. In the presence of only saliva, all strains induced considerably weaker CL responses than those induced in the presence of saliva with active serum. In the presence of serum, intracellular reactions appeared to be the main source of CL, while addition of saliva and active serum increased the extracellular CL. The results indicate that strain-dependent differences exist among A.a. strains in their ability to trigger the oxygen-dependent bactericidal mechanisms of human PNML. In contrast, the CL patterns of H.a. strains were equivalent. Various factors in the environment, such as activated complement and salivary compounds, affect the interaction of these species with neutrophils.
TI  - Electron microscopy of phages in serotypes of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  - Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Actinobacillus ureae, Haemophilus aphrophilus, Haemophilus paraphrophilus, Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Pasteurella haemolytica and Pasteurella multocida strains were examined by transmission electron microscopy for the presence of bacteriophages. Phages were detected in serotype a (SUNY 75) and e (UOH 1705) and in the fresh clinical isolates UOH Q1243 and UOH Q1247 of A. actinomycetemcomitans. Phages were not found in serotype b, c and d strains of A. actinomycetemcomitans, in the fresh clinical isolate UOH Q1244 of this species or in old strains (including reference strains) of related species from the Actinobacillus-Haemophilus-Pasteurella group.
TI  - Identification of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans by leukotoxin gene-specific hybridization and polymerase chain reaction assays.
AB  - Eleven strains of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans isolated from cases of systemic infections, local abscesses, and periodontitis were identified by genetic assays using the leukotoxin gene as the target. We have developed a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay, based on the leukotoxin structural gene of this pathogen, which clearly identified all tested strains of A. actinomycetemcomitans and separated them from the closely related Haemophilus aphrophilus as well as other bacterial species. Furthermore, DNA-DNA hybridization was performed with the cloned partial leukotoxin structural gene (lktA) as a probe, which again clearly distinguished A. actinomycetemcomitans from H. aphrophilus, parts of the normal oral flora, and species harboring RTX (repeats in toxin) family-related cytotoxins. The PCR fragment amplified from the leukotoxin structural gene gave results similar to those given by the cloned leukotoxin gene when used as a probe in hybridization experiments. The hybridization and PCR assays described here are fundamental improvements for the identification of A. actinomycetemcomitans.
TI  - Killing of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Haemophilus aphrophilus by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes in serum and saliva.
AB  - The ability of polymorphonuclear leukocytes from human peripheral blood to kill Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Haemophilus aphrophilus was examined with fresh isolates and laboratory strains from each species (5 strains within each group) under different conditions. Bacterial cells were mixed with a polymorphonuclear leukocyte suspension in the presence of either active serum or heat-inactivated serum or active serum together with sterile-filtered saliva. Surviving bacteria were determined by counting the number of bacterial colony-forming units in the mixtures after a 60-min incubation at 37 degrees C. Mixtures without polymorphonuclear leukocytes served as controls for the evaluation of the degree of killing of the bacteria. In general, A. actinomycetemcomitans resisted phagocytic killing to a greater extent than H. aphrophilus, and the killing of the former species mainly depended on the presence of heat-labile serum components, probably complement factors. Laboratory strains of A. actinomycetemcomitans were more easily killed than fresh isolates. The presence of saliva in the reaction mixtures decreased the degree of killing. However, strain-dependent variations in the killing were found under either condition. The leukotoxic activity of A. actinomycetemcomitans strains, determined by a [51Cr]-release assay, was not correlated with the resistance of these strains to the phagocytic killing. The results point out a strain-dependent difference in the ability of A. actinomycetemcomitans to evade the inflammatory response associated with polymorphonuclear leukocytes. This difference may constitute a potential virulence factor for this periodontopathogen. Furthermore, the leukotoxicity of the strains is not the main determinant that modifies the interaction of A. actinomycetemcomitans with human neutrophils.
TI  - Multivariate chemosystematics demonstrate two groups of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans strains.
AB  - Chemical analysis by us has indicated that Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans is not a homogeneous species. The present study used chemometric methods and a multitude of chemical characters to examine this further. Strains were characterized by cell sugar and fatty acid contents, lysis kinetics during EDTA and EDTA plus lysozyme exposure, methylene blue reduction, and API ZYM enzymatic assessment of whole cells and outer membrane vesicles/fragments. In total, 41 quantitative variables were analyzed from each of 9 strains and treated with principal component analysis and soft independent modeling of class analogy. These methods divided A. actinomycetemcomitans into 2 strain groups. One group contained ATCC 33384, ATCC 29522, FDC 2112 and FDC 2043; the other comprised ATCC 29524, ATCC 29523, FDC 2097, FDC 511 and FDC Y4. With an F-test, the groups (classes) of A. actinomycetemcomitans strains could be distinguished at 95% confidence limits. Both groups were distinct from members of the genera Haemophilus and Pasteurella (Haemophilus aphrophilus, Haemophilus paraphrophilus, Haemophilus influenzae, Pasteurella multocida and Pasteurella haemolytica).
TI  - Genetic relationship of strains of Haemophilus aphrophilus, H. paraphrophilus, and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans studied by ribotyping.
AB  - Strains of H. aphrophilus, H. paraphrophilus, and A. actinomycetemcomitans are phenotypically very similar. Ribotyping of 24 strains of H. aphrophilus, 22 strains of H. paraphrophilus, 8 strains of A. actinomycetemcomitans, and one strain each of the species Pasteurella aerogenes, H. parahaemolyticus, and the genus Capnocytophaga was studied using a non-radioactive digoxigenin labelled probe based on E. coli 16S- and 23S-ribosomal RNA. Restriction fragments were generated using restriction enzyme EcoRI. The ribotypes were analysed by a numerical approach using UPGMA clustering. Two major clusters were seen: One contained all A. actinomycetemcomitans strains, the other all H. aprophilus and all except one H. paraphrophilus strain intermingled between each other. The H. paraphrophilus strain not found in the H. aphrophilus/H. paraphrophilus cluster, the H. parahaemolyticus, P. aerogenes, and the Capnocytophaga strains clustered separately from each other and the two major clusters. The H. paraphrophilus strain with the deviating ribotype was atypical in other respects: it neither did ferment lactose nor mannose and it was isolated from a deer in contradiction to the remaining H. paraphrophilus strains, which were human isolates. This study supports the view that H. aphrophilus and H. paraphrophilus should be regarded as one species separated from A. actinomycetemcomitans.
TI  - Rapid identification of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans based on analysis of 23S ribosomal RNA.
AB  - Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans is a key microorganism in the pathogenesis of several different forms of periodontal diseases. Identification of this bacterium from clinical specimens may often be complicated by the fact that the colony morphology on TSBV selective medium closely resembles that of Haemophilus aphrophilus and a key differentiating characteristic, catalase reaction, may be variable. Recent genetic studies have shown that the 23S ribosomal RNA molecule is split into two smaller forms in A. actinomycetemcomitans, but is intact in H. aphrophilus. Based on this finding, we describe a new, rapid method for identifying A. actinomycetemcomitans in which single colonies isolated from culture on TSBV agar in 5% CO2 in air are lysed, electrophoresed on 1.5% submarine agarose gels and visualized by staining with ethidium bromide. Using this assay, A. actinomycetemcomitans can be easily distinguished from morphologically similar colonies such as H. aphrophilus strains by differences in 23S rRNA within 2 h.
TI  - Sensitivity of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Haemophilus aphrophilus to oxidative killing.
AB  - We examined the killing of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Haemophilus aphrophilus by oxygen metabolites generated by the xanthine-xanthine oxidase (X-XO) system. This system generates a mixture of oxidants, including superoxide radical, hydrogen peroxide, hydroxyl radical, and possibly singlet oxygen. Differential sensitivity to the X-XO system was observed among strains of A. actinomycetemcomitans; notably, 2 catalase-deficient strains and 2 strains representative of serotypes b and c were the most susceptible. H. aphrophilus was not sensitive. The amount of oxidants produced by the X-XO system more closely correlated with killing than the ratio of oxidant production. Cytochrome c, superoxide dismutase, catalase, dimethyl sulfoxide, and desferrioxamine were used to determine the role of superoxide radical, hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radical in the bactericidal process. Hydrogen peroxide was the major bactericidal agent against A. actinomycetemcomitans. Superoxide anion participated in killing of A. actinomycetemcomitans to varying but lesser degrees. The intracellular generation of hydroxyl radical was implicated in the killing of several strains. We conclude that (i) strains of A. actinomycetemcomitans are differentially sensitive to the bactericidal effects of the X-XO system and (ii) of the oxidants produced by the X-XO system, hydrogen peroxide is the most bactericidal against A. actinomycetemcomitans.
TI  - Cell surface hydrophobicity and electrokinetic potential of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Haemophilus aphrophilus.
AB  - Laboratory strains and fresh isolates of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Haemophilus aphrophilus were examined for cell surface hydrophobicity and for electrokinetic properties under different experimental conditions. Fresh isolates of A. actinomycetemcomitans and H. aphrophilus were hydrophobic. Laboratory strains of A. actinomycetemcomitans were 20-30% less hydrophobic than fresh isolates. No difference was observed between laboratory and fresh isolates of H. aphrophilus. The pH of the suspending buffer, growth phase or incubation atmosphere did not significantly affect the hydrophobicity of the 2 species, whereas agar cultures of H. aphrophilus were less hydrophobic than broth cultures. All A. actinomycetemcomitans strains treated with sterile filtered saliva showed a concentration-dependent decrease in hydrophobicity of at most 30%. H. aphrophilus strains were not affected by the same treatment. Laboratory strains of H. aphrophilus were more negatively charged than A. actinomycetemcomitans, whereas fresh isolates of the 2 species exhibited similar surface charge. In the presence of saliva the mean cell surface charge of laboratory strains decreased by 56% for A. actinomycetemcomitans and by 73% for H. aphrophilus. The results indicate that the 2 species differ in expression of cell structures accounting for hydrophobicity and surface charge and that environmental factors might differently influence the physical properties of the two species analyzed.
