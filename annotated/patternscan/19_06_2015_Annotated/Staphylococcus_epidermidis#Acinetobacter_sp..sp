TI  == antibacterial activity of ovary extract from sea urchin diadema setosum.
AB  == objective: sea urchin gonad is considered as a highly prized delicacy in several  countries. it is also rich in valuable bioactive compounds including polyunsaturated fatty acids (pufas) and beta-carotene. this study was undertaken  to examine the antimicrobial properties of the ovary extract from sea urchin diadema setosum against selected gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. materials and methods: the ovary extract was obtained using two different solvents such as methanol and chloroform. the obtained extract was used to examine its potential antimicrobial properties against the following 11 bacterial species using the disc diffusion method: gram-negative bacteria (salmonella typhi, salmonella typhimurium, shigella flexneri, pseudomonas aeruginosa, aeromonas hydrophila, acinetobacter sp, citrobacter freundii and klebsiella pneumonia) and gram-positive bacteria (bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus aureus). the activity was measured in terms of zone of inhibition (mm). results: the methanol extract exhibited a higher zone of inhibition against all the bacteria taken for examination. whereas, the ovary extract obtained by chloroform did not show any antimicrobial activity against s. typhi, s. epidermidis, c. freundii and k. pneumonia. the results indicated that the ovary extract obtained by methanol extracts are capable of inhibiting the growth of pathogenic microbes taken for analysis. moreover, the result indicates  the presence of antimicrobial agents in sea urchin ovary. conclusions: the study  suggests that the ovary extract of d. setosum may be a potential source of antimicrobial agent for pathogenic microorganisms.

TI  == physical impaction injury effects on bacterial cells during spread plating influenced by cell characteristics of the organisms.
AB  == aims: to understand the factors that contribute to the variations in colony-forming units (cfu) in different bacteria during spread plating. methods and results: employing a mix culture of vegetative cells of ten organisms varying in cell characteristics (gram reaction, cell shape and cell size), spread plating to the extent of just drying the agar surface (50-60 s) was tested in comparison  with the alternate spotting-and-tilt-spreading (sats) approach where 100 mul inoculum was distributed by mere tilting of plate after spotting as 20-25 microdrops. the former imparted a significant reduction in cfu by 20% over the spreader-independent sats approach. extending the testing to single organisms, gram-negative proteobacteria with relatively larger cells (escherichia, enterobacter, agrobacterium, ralstonia, pantoea, pseudomonas and sphingomonas spp.) showed significant cfu reduction with spread plating except for slow-growing methylobacterium sp., while those with small rods (xenophilus sp.) and cocci (acinetobacter sp.) were less affected. among gram-positive nonspore formers, staphylococcus epidermidis showed significant cfu reduction while staphylococcus haemolyticus and actinobacteria (microbacterium, cellulosimicrobium and brachybacterium spp.) with small rods/cocci were unaffected. vegetative cells of bacillus pumilus and b. subtilis were generally unaffected while others with larger rods (b. thuringiensis, brevibacillus, lysinibacillus and paenibacillus spp.) were significantly affected. a simulated plating study coupled with live-dead bacterial staining endorsed the chances of cell disruption with spreader impaction in afflicted organisms. conclusions: significant reduction in cfu could occur during spread plating due to physical impaction injury to bacterial cells depending on the spreader usage and the variable effects on different organisms are determined by gram reaction, cell size and cell shape. the inoculum spreader could impart physical disruption of vegetative cells against a hard surface. significance and impact of study: possibility of cfu reduction in sensitive organisms and the skewed selection of hardier organisms during spread plating, and the recommendation of sats as an easier and safer alternative for cfu enumerations.

TI  == [urinary tract infection in patient after brain injury].
AB  == intruduction: one of the most important problems in treating patients after head  injury is urinary complication. the first place take urinary infections, which disturb rehabilitation process. clean intermittent catherization, bladder training and good care do not preserve infection. the purpose of our study was to present the frequency of urinary infections and main pathogens involved in these  infections among patients treated in the department of rehabilitation after head  injury. material and methods: we gathered microbiological tests and observations  from 398 patients (from 2 to 73 years old) after head injury treated in years 2003-2005. some of them survived head injury and some of them had also multiorgan injury. results: in 133 of them we found bladder and urethra infections, vesical  calculus in 11 cases. in one case we found prostatic abscessus and in one case urethroscrotal fistula. each patient had microbiological test of urine after he was admitted to the department. if the test was positive he had pharmacological treatment. in 157 urinary infections we selected proteus sp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, klebsiella sp., enterococcus sp., acinetobacter sp. serratia marcescens, morganella morganii, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus agalactiae and candida albicans was represented not so often. conclusions: the most frequent pathogens were: proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, e. coli. most of patients had positive microbiological tests at the admittance to our department. these complications extend the rehabilitation process and generate high costs. it is necessary to create standards of care of neuropathic bladder in patients after head injury.

TI  == stability of microbial communities in goat milk during a lactation year: molecular approaches.
AB  == the microbial communities in milks from one herd were evaluated during 1-year of  lactation, using molecular methods to evaluate their stability and the effect of  breeding conditions on their composition. the diversity of microbial communities  was measured using two approaches: molecular identification by 16s and 18s rdna sequencing of isolates from counting media (two milks), and direct identification using 16s rdna from clone libraries (six milks). the stability of these communities was evaluated by counting on selective media and by single strand conformation polymorphism (sscp) analysis of variable region v3 of the 16s rrna gene and variable region v4 of the 18s rrna gene. one hundred and eighteen milk samples taken throughout the year were analyzed. wide diversity among bacteria and yeasts in the milk was revealed. in addition to species commonly encountered  in milk, such as lactococcus lactis, lactococcus garvieae, enterococcus faecalis, lactobacillus casei, leuconostoc mesenteroides, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus simulans, staphylococcus caprae, staphylococcus equorum, micrococcus sp., kocuria sp., pantoea agglomerans and pseudomonas putida, sequences were affiliated to other species only described in cheeses, such as corynebacterium variabile, arthrobacter sp., brachybacterium paraconglomeratum, clostridium sp. and rothia sp. several halophilic species atypical in milk were found, belonging to jeotgalicoccus psychrophilus, salinicoccus sp., dietza maris, exiguobacterium, ornithinicoccus sp. and hahella chejuensis. the yeast community  was composed of debaryomyces hansenii, kluyveromyces lactis, trichosporon beigelii, rhodotorula glutinis, rhodotorula minuta, candida pararugosa, candida intermedia, candida inconspicua, cryptococcus curvatus and cryptococcus magnus. the analyses of microbial counts and microbial sscp profiles both distinguished four groups of milks corresponding to four periods defined by season and feeding  regime. the microbial community was stable within each period. milks from winter  were characterized by lactococcus and pseudomonas, those from summer by p. agglomerans and klebsiella and those from autumn by chryseobacterium indologenes, acinetobacter baumanii, staphylococcus, corynebacteria and yeasts. however, the composition of the community can vary according to factors other than feeding. this study opens new investigation fields in the field of raw milk microbial ecology.

TI  == nature of bacteria found on some wards in sultan qaboos university hospital, oman.
AB  == this study aims to determine what objects lying in the hospital environment or brought in from outside contribute to the introduction of bacteria associated with nosocomial infections. one hundred swab specimens collected from children's  toys, sinks, door handles, telephone handsets and flowers brought into the hospital were plated on different culture media. colonial growth on the media was purified and identified subsequently using standard bacteriological methods. of the 100 samples cultured, 61 (61%) grew a range of bacteria including pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=14, 23.0%), acinetobacter spp. (n=13, 21.3%), serratia spp. (n=9, 14.7%), staphylococcus epidermidis (n=9, 14.7%), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n=4, 6.6%), staphylococcus aureus (n=4, 6.6%), enterobacter cloacae (n=3, 4.9%), pantoea sp. (n=2, 3.3%), chryseobacterium sp. (n=2, 3.3%) and klebsiella pneumoniae (n=1, 1.6%). although all the serratia, enterobacter, klebsiella and pantoea species isolates showed varying degrees of resistance to gentamicin, ceftriaxone, cefuroxime and cefotaxime, all were resistant to ampicillin. chryseobacterium and stenotrophomonas species isolates were resistant to amikacin, imipenem, gentamicin and ceftazidime, to which only three isolates of pseudomonas species were resistant. all the staphylococcal isolates were susceptible to methicillin. although there has been no major outbreak of a nosocomial infection in the hospital, it is strongly recommended that effective control measures (e.g., sampling the hospital water supply, disinfecting children's toys, use of appropriate hand washing and checking some of the disinfectants for presence of bacteria) are needed. these measures are necessary  to ensure that the antibiotic-resistant strains identified in this study are not  allowed to spread in the hospital.

TI  == multiple organ failure in septic patients.
AB  == multiple organ failure (mof) is the main cause of death in icus, especially affecting septic patients. it is strongly related to number of systems with failure, type of system involved, risk factors such as age, previous chronic diseases, delayed or inadequate resuscitation, persistent infection, immune suppression, and others. the prognoses is worse for patients rather than in elective or emergency surgical patients. the objective of this article is to provide data from our university teaching hospital icu related to the incidence of septic patients, the distribution of mof, and distribution of failure among each of the organs. the mortality rate, relationship between mortality and age, and mortality and types of organs affected were evaluated. the main bacterial causes of sepsis were also identified. a retrospective evaluation was done of 249 patients admitted to the icu in a 4 month period during 1999. fifty four patients had sepsis diagnosed by accs/sccm criteria. there were 37 men and 17 women; 24 medical and 30 post-surgical patients (9 after elective surgery and 21 emergency  patients). apache ii score was calculated on admission and mof, measured for the  first five days, was diagnosed using marshall and meakins criteria. the statistical method used was non-parametric mann-whitney test, p<0.05 was considered significant. the incidence of sepsis was recorded in 54/249 patients (22%). thirty of these 54 patients (56%) died. death occurred in 2 of 11 patients with one organ failure (18%), in 14/27 with 2 or 3 organ failures (52%), and 14/16 with 4 or more organ failures (88%). none of the three patients 15 to 20 years old died, 17/32 (55%) patients age 21-60 years, and >61 years 13/19 (68%),  died. there were 23 patients with positive bacterial culture. the most frequent bacteria found were: pseudomonas aeruginosa (5), multiresistant acinetobacter baumanii (3), staphylococcus epidermidis (3), enterobacter aerogenes (3), klebsiella pneumoniae (2) and multiresistant staphylococcus aureus (2). the mean  value +/- sd of apache ii (mortality risk) for survivors was 21 +/- 18 and for non-survivors 42 +/- 26 (p<0.001). we conclude that mof due to sepsis in an icu is frequent, with high mortality related to the number of failing organs, age and high apache ii.

TI  == [bacterial strains isolated from neutropenic patients and their resistance to antibiotics].
AB  == background: although gram negative as well as gram positive bacteria participate  in febrile episodes of neutropenic patients, in particular recently the ratio of  gram positive bacteria is increasing. the objective of the present work was to investigate the incidence and antibiotic resistance of pathogenic bacterial agents in neutropenic patients. methods and results: the presence of bacteria was investigated in 446 neutropenic patients hospitalized at the haematological clinic in 1995. haemocultures (apparatus bact/alert 120, cultivation media organon-teknika) and urine were examined. the sensitivity for antibiotics was tested by the standard dilution micromethod. in blood most frequently staphylococcus epidermidis was isolated (45.4%), coagulase-negative strains of staphylococcus haemolyticus, staphylococcus hominis and staphylococcus saprophyticus (14.4%), acinetobacter calcoaceticus-baumannii (complex 6.3%) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (6.3%). in urine the following were detected: staphylococcus epidermidis (36.5%), enterococcus sp. (14.5%), escherichia coli (13.1%), enterococcus faecalis (11.6%) and enterococcus solitarius (6.5%). in all strains resistance to antibiotics and chemotherapeutic drugs was assessed. conclusions: investigation of the frequency of different bacterial species, along with monitoring of the resistance is an essential prerequisite of initial antibiotic therapy of febrile episodes in neutropenic patients.

TI  == childhood bacteremia in israel: causes, age relation, predisposing factors and source.
AB  == to delineate the spectrum of childhood bacteremia in a tertiary medical center in israel and to define the historical, clinical and environmental variables that affect it, 339 bacteremic episodes were studied. ten of the episodes (3%) were polymicrobial and 148 (44%) were hospital acquired. staphylococcus epidermidis (17%), staph. aureus (10%), gram-negative bacilli and haemophilus influenzae (7%) were the most frequent etiologic pathogens. some organisms (e.g., h. influenzae,  streptococcus pneumoniae) caused mainly community-acquired bacteremia, while klebsiella sp., enterococcus faecalis, and acinetobacter sp. caused mainly nosocomial bacteremia. underlying conditions were noted in 72% of the bacteremic  children. a source of the bacteremia was identified in 60% of the episodes; the most common was i.v.-line infection. age, underlying condition, source and location in the hospital markedly affected the profile of microorganisms causing  childhood bacteremia. each of these variables defined 3-5 organisms that were most prominent. in each episode of suspected bacteremia, these variables should be considered, thus defining the most likely causative pathogen(s), which should  be covered by appropriate empiric antimicrobial treatment.

TI  == [clinical evaluation of imipenem/cilastatin sodium in the internal medicine].
AB  == fifty-two patients with moderate or severe infections associated with internal medicine were treated with imipenem/cilastatin sodium (ipm/cs) and the efficacy and the safety of this drug were evaluated. there were 20 patients with pneumonia, 10 with acute exacerbation of chronic respiratory tract infections, 9  with sepsis, 2 with pyothorax, 3 with intraabdominal infection, 2 with urinary tract infection, 1 with pulmonary abscess, 1 with infective endocarditis, 4 with  fever of unknown origin. forty-four patients were evaluable for the efficacy. clinical efficacies were excellent in 12 patients, good in 26, fair in 3 and poor in 3. the overall clinical efficacy was 86.4%. the efficacy rate was 63.6% in patients previously treated and 93.9% in patients previously untreated with other antibiotics. bacteriologically, staphylococcus aureus (8 strains), streptococcus  pneumoniae (5), streptococcus pyogenes (1), other gram-positive coccus (1), klebsiella pneumoniae (8), haemophilus influenzae (4), pseudomonas aeruginosa (3), serratia marcescens (3), escherichia coli (3), branhamella catarrhalis (1),  citrobacter freundii (1), klebsiella oxytoca (1), enterobacter sp. (1), and peptostreptococcus sp. (1) were eradicated. p. aeruginosa (3) and acinetobacter sp. (1) decreased. s. aureus (1), s. epidermidis (1), p. aeruginosa (5), and s. marcescens (1) persisted or appeared. the eradication rate was 83.7%. six patients showed adverse reactions including general fatigue 1, epigastralgia 1, eruption 1, eosinophilia 1 and elevation of s-got 2. but all of the adverse reactions were mild or slight, and transient. these findings indicate that ipm/cs is a useful and safe drug against bacterial infections in internal medicine.

TI  == [value of the technique of cellular lysis by thermic shock in the isolation of bacteria causing osteoarticular infections].
AB  == the purpose of this work is to compare, a conventional technique, for bacterial isolation, with a lysis-centrifugation method using a rapid freezing in liquid nitrogen, followed by decongelation at 37 degrees c for bone and joint samples. the bone and joint specimens were biopsies and punctions (35 cases) or fistula (10 cases). the residual antibiotic activity of the sample was determined using a susceptible strain of micrococcus luteus and of staphylococcus epidermidis. among the 45 samples, 20 were sterile with both methods among which 8 exhibited a residual antibiotic activity which may have contributed to isolation failure. in  12 cases, bacterial isolates were obtained with both methods. cultures were obtained from 13 samples with the lysis centrifugation method alone. the isolates were 4 staphylococcus aureus, 8 coagulase-negative staphylococcus and 1 acinetobacter sp. these results suggest that the intracellular location of bacteria may be responsible for the negative cultures from bone or joint specimens.

TI  == lid flora in blepharitis.
AB  == the microbiologic evaluations of 332 consecutive patients with the primary diagnosis of chronic blepharitis were reviewed and compared to those of 160 control patients. the most commonly isolated organisms from lids with blepharitis were staphylococcus epidermidis (95.8%), propronibacterium acnes (92.8%), corynebacterium sp. (76.8%), acinetobacter sp. (11.4%), and staphylococcus aureus (10.5%). compared to controls, s. epidermidis (p less than 0.01), p. acnes (p less than 0.02), and corynebacterium sp. (p less than 0.001) were present significantly more often. s. aureus and the isolation of more than one microbial  species were not more common in blepharitis patients. quantitatively, heavy growth, by total and individual species, was significantly more common in blepharitis patients (total, p less than 0.001; s. epidermidis, p less than 0.001, p. acnes, p less than 0.001). these data demonstrate that patients with blepharitis are more likely to have normal skin bacteria on their lids and in greater quantities than nonblepharitis patients.

TI  == [susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. focusing mainly on ofloxacin (first report). reported by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility of clinical isolates].
AB  == susceptibility tests were carried out on a variety of clinically isolated pathogens using the susceptibility disc method at 197 hospitals in japan between  may, 1985 through march, 1986. these tests were organized by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility on clinical isolates, and the results were statistically analyzed. this paper describes a comparison of susceptibilities of  clinical isolates including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, morganella  morganii, serratia marcescens, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp. and campylobacter jejuni to ofloxacin (oflx) and conventional antibacterial drugs. the results obtained were  summarized as follows. 1. oflx showed strong antibacterial activity against s. aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, e. aerogenes, e. cloacae, c. freundii, k. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp. and c. jejuni and only a few strains were resistant to oflx. moreover, oflx has superior antibacterial activity against many species compared not only to norfloxacin but also to most of the conventional antibacterial drugs. 2. when studied by sampled materials such as sputum, urine, abscesses and otorrhea, oflx occasionally showed different actions against the same species from different sources. almost species from the  urinary isolates were less sensitive than those from the sputum.

TI  == serum bactericidal activity and postantibiotic effect in serum of patients with urinary tract infection receiving high-dose amikacin.
AB  == ten patients received a 30-min infusion of amikacin (30 mg/kg) on day 1 and 15 mg/kg on day 2. mean serum creatinine was 1.1 +/- 0.3 (standard deviation) mg/dl  before and 1.0 +/- 0.3 mg/dl 3 days after the second infusion. mean serum amikacin concentrations before, at the end of infusion, and 1, 6, 12, and 24 h after 30 and 15 mg/kg were 0, 157, 79, 31, 16, 5, 5, 85, 51, 19, 12, and 5 mg/liter, respectively. five strains each of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis susceptible and resistant to oxacillin, streptococcus  (enterococcus) faecalis, corynebacterium sp. strain jk, listeria monocytogenes, mycobacterium fortuitum (three strains), klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were tested.  serum bactericidal activities (sbas) were greater than or equal to 1:8 in greater than or equal to 80% of the sera 1 and 6 h after 30 mg/kg and in greater than or  equal to 60% of the sera 1 and 6 h after 15 mg/kg against staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis susceptible to oxacillin, a. calcoaceticus, and k. pneumoniae. l. monocytogenes, serratia marcescens, and p. aeruginosa had lower sbas. very low or no activity was observed against oxacillin-resistant staphylococci and streptococcus faecalis. the study of the killing rate in serum  confirmed these results. postantibiotic effect was studied by incubating a strain from each species in serum samples obtained 1 and 6 h after both regimens for 0.5, 1, or 2 h. the duration of postantibiotic effect depended on the duration of contact and the concentration of amikacin for the following organisms: oxacillin-susceptible staphylococci, l. monocytogenes, p. aeruginosa, a. calcoaceticus, k. pneumoniae, and serratia marcescens. m. fortuitum was killed after 30 min of contact. no postantibiotic effect was observed with streptococcus faecalis, corynebacterium sp. strain jk, or oxacillin-resistant staphylococci. amikacin at 30 mg/kg provided high levels and sbas against susceptible pathogens. prolonged postantibiotic effects were observed. no signs of nephrotoxicity occurred.

TI  == assessment of head-space gas-liquid chromatography for the rapid detection of growth in blood cultures.
AB  == blood for transfusion was inoculated with between 10(0) and 10(2) colony-forming  units (cfu) per ml of each of 59 microbial isolates and added to cooked meat broth. at intervals up to 72 h incubation, the cultures were examined by conventional visual inspection and automated head-space gas-liquid chromatography (hs-glc). forty-six isolates including all those examined of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, s. pneumoniae, s. faecalis, s. milleri, s. mitior, s. mitis, s. salivarius, s. sanguis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, serratia sp., enterobacter cloacae, bacterioides fragilis, clostridium perfringens, candida albicans, c. krusei and torulopsis glabrata, and three isolates of staphylococcus epidermidis, were detected by hs-glc. hs-glc failed to detect the growth of eleven isolates including all those of pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter calcoaceticus. haemophilus influenzae, corynebacterium sp. and two isolates of s. epidermidis. the growth of all 59 isolates were detected by visual inspection. no significant difference was found between hs-glc analysis and visual inspection in the speed of detection of bacterial isolates. all the yeast isolates were detected by hs-glc after 24 h incubation, indicating that it may be possible to detect fungemias earlier by hs-glc analysis than by other methods.

TI  == isolations of aerobic bacteria from wild desert bighorn sheep (ovis canadensis nelsoni and o. c. mexicana) in arizona.
AB  == nasal, pharyngeal, cervical and vaginal swab specimens were obtained from 74 desert bighorn sheep for the purpose of investigating the normal aerobic bacterial flora of wild sheep. a total of 281 isolates was obtained and identified by standard microbiologic tests. one hundred seven of these isolates were gram positive and included bacillus sp. (36%), staphylococcus epidermidis (8%), s. aureus (4%), corynebacterium sp. (diphtheroids, 4%), and streptococcus sp. (48%). gram negative isolates totaled 174 and included neisseria sp. (18%), citrobacter sp. (3%), enterobacter sp. (2%), escherichia coli (2%), proteus sp. (2%) and non-fermentative bacilli (nfb) (73%). of the nfb isolates, pseudomonas sp. (25%), acinetobacter sp. (18%), moraxella sp. (15%) were identified.

TI  == in vitro activity of a new semisynthetic cephalosporin: cefoperazone.
AB  == cefoperazone is a new semisynthetic cephalosporin with excellent antibacterial activity. this study included more than 1,500 clinical isolates whose susceptibility to cefoperazone was determined by minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimal bactericidal concentration (mbc). cefoperazone was highly active against enterobacteriaceae including indolepositive proteus, serratia and  enterobacter sp. particularly noteworthy was the high activity of cefoperazone against pseudomonas and acinetobacter strains, which are usually resistant to first- and second-generation cephalosporins. the activity of cefoperazone against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, group d streptococci and haemophilus was also determined. in general, the differences between mic and mbc  were minimal. additional studies were carried out to determine the effect of inoculum size on cefoperazone activity.

TI  == rapid antimicrobial susceptibility test using tetrazolium reduction.
AB  == a rapid method of antimicrobial susceptibility testing has been developed, which  uses a modified microdilution procedure and an inoculum of 10(7) bacteria per ml. results are determined within 4 h with an indicator consisting of 2(p-iodophenyl)-3(p-nitrophenyl)-5-phenyltetrazolium chloride. the precipitation  of a red formazan by bacteria uninhibited by antimicrobials is accelerated by the addition of phenazine methosulfate. isolates are classified as resistant, indeterminate, or susceptible, based on growth in up to two antimicrobial concentrations which conform closely to concentrations which correlate with the millimeter breakpoints used in the bauer-kirby method. results of testing 10 antimicrobial agents against 1,126 isolates were compared with results obtained when the bauer-kirby method and the agar dilution procedure were used as reference methods. enterococci were excluded because of false resistance. discrepancies were classified as very major (false susceptibility), major (false  resistance), and minor (combinations of susceptibility or resistance with indeterminate results). the rapid method versus the agar dilution method yielded  2.3% very major, 0.7% major, and 2.9% minor discrepancies, for a total of 6.0%. of 58 organism-antimicrobial agent combinations tested, 23 displayed 1% very major discrepancies between the rapid method and the agar dilution method. six were not therapeutically important. the remainder involved staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, acinetobacter sp., and most organisms tested with chloramphenicol. it is suggested that adjustments in antibiotic concentrations and/or inoculum size may eliminate these discrepancies. the rapid method appeared economical when compared with autobac 1 and the bauer-kirby procedure.

TI  == [kinetics of setting up of a human fecal flora in germ free mice and trial of decontamination of antibiotherapy (author's transl)].
AB  == we have tried in this study to reproduce in germfree mice a bacterial equilibrium observed previously in the gastrointestinal tract of child "l.n.", reared in a plastic isolator. eight bacterial strains were studied. seven had been fortuitously introduced: acinetobacter lwoffi ln1, staphylococcus epidermidis ln2, clostridium perfringens ln3, plectridium anatum ln4, streptococcus bovis ln5, enterobacter cloacae ln6, corynebacterium sp ln7. the eighth strain was purposely administered to the child in order to take advantage of an antagonism between this strain and spontaneously acquired flora. this strain is bacillus licheniformis fd1. the gnotoxenic mice proved to be a good experimental model because we found their bacterial equilibrium comparable to that observed in child l.n. in addition, we studied the decontamination procedures of the gastrointestinal tract of mice by observing both the antagonism of b. licheniformis with bacitracin, and the action of a suitable mixture of antibiotics. conditions for the realization of this decontamination are discussed in this study.
