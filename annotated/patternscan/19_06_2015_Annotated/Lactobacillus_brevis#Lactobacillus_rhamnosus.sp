TI  == antimicrobial activity and antibiotic susceptibility of and spp. intended for use as starter and probiotic cultures.
AB  == antimicrobial activity and antibiotic susceptibility were tested for 23 lactobacillus and three bifidobacterium strains isolated from different ecological niches. agar-well diffusion method was used to test the antagonistic effect (against staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, bacillus cereus and candida albicans) of acid and neutralized (ph 5.5) lyophilized concentrated supernatants (cell-free supernatant; cfs) and whey (cell-free whey fractions; cfw) from de man-rogosa-sharpe/trypticase-phytone-yeast broth and skim milk. acid cfs and cfw showed high acidification rate-dependent bacterial inhibition; five strains were active against c. albicans. neutralized cfs/cfw assays showed six strains active against s. aureus (l. acidophilus l-1, l. brevis 1, l. fermentum 1, b. animalis subsp. lactis l-3), e. coli (l. bulgaricus 6) or b. cereus (l. plantarum 24-4capital ve, cyrillic). inhibition of two pathogens with neutralized cfs (l. bulgaricus 6, l. helveticus 3, l. plantarum 24-2l, l. fermentum 1)/cfw (l. plantarum 24-5d, l. plantarum 24-4capital ve, cyrillic) was detected. some strains maintained activity after ph neutralization, indicating presence of active substances. the antibiotics minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were  determined by the epsilometer test method. all strains were susceptible to ampicillin, gentamicin, erythromycin and tetracycline. four lactobacilli were resistant to one antibiotic (l. rhamnosus lio 1 to streptomycin) or two antibiotics (l. acidophilus l-1 and l. brevis 1 to kanamycin and clindamycin; l.  casei l-4 to clindamycin and chloramphenicol). vancomycin mics > 256 mug/ml indicated intrinsic resistance for all heterofermentative lactobacilli. the antimicrobially active strains do not cause concerns about antibiotic resistance  transfer and could be used as natural biopreservatives in food and therapeutic formulations.

TI  == examination of the technological properties of newly isolated strains of the genus and possibilities for their application in the composition of starters.
AB  == the ability of four lactobacillus strains - lactobacillus brevis lbrz7 (isolated  from fermented cabbage), lactobacillus plantarum lbrz12 (isolated from fermented  cabbage), lactobacillus fermentum lbrh9 (of human origin) and lactobacillus casei ssp. rhamnosus lbrc11 (isolated from home-made cheese) - to grow in flour/water environment and to accumulate high concentrations of viable cells was examined. two starters for sourdough were created for lab-scale production of wheat bread:  a two-strain starter and a four-strain starter. wheat bread with improved properties - greater loaf volume, enhanced flavour and softer and brighter crumb  - was obtained from the 7% four-strain starter sourdough. the addition of sourdough in the production of wheat bread affected positively the technological  and organoleptic characteristics of the final bread by inhibiting the growth of wild yeasts and mold and bacillus spores without the addition of preservatives. the inclusion of 15% of the four-strain starter sourdough in the bread-making process led to enhanced safety and longer shelf life of the baked bread.

TI  == inhibitory activity in vitro of probiotic lactobacilli against oral candida under different fermentation conditions.
AB  == clinical studies have shown that probiotics positively affect oral health by decreasing gum bleeding and/or reducing salivary counts of certain oral pathogens. our aim was to investigate the inhibitory effect of six probiotic lactobacilli against opportunistic oral candida species. sugar utilisation by both lactobacilli and candida was also assessed. agar overlay assay was utilised  to study growth inhibition of candida albicans, candida glabrata and candida krusei by lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactobacillus casei shirota, lactobacillus  reuteri sd2112, lactobacillus brevis cd2, lactobacillus bulgaricus lb86 and l. bulgaricus lb lact. the inhibitory effect was measured at ph 5.5, 6.4, and 7.2, respectively, and in the presence of five different carbohydrates in growth medium (glucose, fructose, lactose, sucrose, and sorbitol). growth and final ph values were measured at two-hour time points to 24 h. l. rhamnosus gg showed the  strongest inhibitory activity in fructose and glucose medium against c. albicans, followed by l. casei shirota, l. reuteri sd2112 and l. brevis cd2. none of the lactobacilli tested affected the growth of c. krusei. only l. rhamnosus gg produced slight inhibitory effect on c. glabrata. the lower ph values led to larger inhibition zones. sugar fermentation profiles varied between the strains.  l. casei shirota grew in the presence of all sugars tested, whereas l. brevis cd2 could utilise only glucose and fructose. all candida species metabolised the available sugars but the most rapid growth was observed with c. glabrata. the results suggest that commercially available probiotics differ in their inhibitory activity and carbohydrate utilisation; the above properties are modified by different ph values and sugars with more pronounced inhibition at lower ph.

TI  == probiotic lactic acid bacteria detoxify n-nitrosodimethylamine.
AB  == humans can be exposed to n-nitroso compounds (nocs) due to many environmental sources, as well as endogenous formation. the main nitrosamine found in food products and also synthesised in vivo by intestinal microbiota is n-nitrosodimethylamine (ndma). it can cause cancer of the stomach, kidney and colon. the effect of four probiotic lactobacillus strains on ndma was studied under different culture conditions (24 h in mrs, 168 h in modified mrs n, and 168 h in phosphate buffer). hplc and gc-tea methods were used for ndma determination  in supernatants. the influence of lactic acid bacteria on ndma genotoxicity was investigated by means of the comet assay. additionally, the effect of ndma (2-100 microg ml(-)(1)) on the growth and survival of the probiotic strains was studied. the results indicate that the bacteria decreased ndma concentration by up to 50%, depending on the culture conditions, time of incubation, ndma concentration, ph and bacterial strain. lb. brevis 0945 lowered the concentration and genotoxicity  of ndma most effectively by up to 50%. this could be due to either adsorption or  metabolism. the growth and survival of the bacteria was not affected by any of the tested ndma concentrations.

TI  == construction of a constitutively expressed homo-fermentative pathway in lactobacillus brevis.
AB  == lactobacillus brevis is a promising lactic acid producing strain that simultaneously utilizes glucose and xylose from lignocellulosic hydrolysate without carbon catabolic repression and inhibition. the production of by-products acetic acid and ethanol has been the major drawback of this strain. two genes, pfka (fructose-6-phosphate kinase [pfk]) and fbaa (fructose-1,6-biphosphate aldolase [fba]), that encode the key enzymes of the emp/glycolytic pathway from lactobacillus rhamnosus, were fused to the downstream of the strong promoter p32  and expressed in l. brevis s3f4 as a strategy to minimize the formation of by-products. by expressing the two enzymes, a homo-fermentative pathway for lactic acid production was constructed. the lactic acid yields achieved from glucose in the transformants were 1.12 and 1.16 mol/mol, which is higher than that of the native strain (0.74 mol/mol). however, the lactic acid yield from xylose in the transformants stayed the same as that of the native strain. enzyme  assay indicated that the activity of the foreign protein fba in the transformants was much higher than that of the native strains, but was ten times lower than that in l. rhamnosus. this result was consistent with the metabolic flux analysis, which indicated that the conversion efficiency of the expressed pfk and fba was somewhat low. less than 20 % of the carbons accumulated in the form of fructose-6-phosphate were converted into glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (gap) by the  expressed pfk and fba. metabolic flux analysis also indicated that the enzyme phosphoketolase (xpk) played an important role in splitting the carbon flow from  the pentose phosphate pathway to the phosphoketolase pathway. this study suggested that the lactic acid yield of l. brevis could be improved by constructing a homo-fermentative pathway.

TI  == purification and characterization of anti-alicyclobacillus bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus rhamnosus.
AB  == lactobacillus rhamnosus cicc 20975 produces a 6,502-da bacteriocin, named bacteriocin rc 20975, active against alicyclobacillus acidoterrestris, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus brevis, bacillus subtilis, and listeria  innocua. this bacteriocin is not quite heat stable but is effective after refrigerated storage and freeze-thaw cycles. bacteriocin rc 20975 was added at a  concentration of 256 au/ml to the endospores of a. acidoterrestris dsm 3922; no viable cells were detected after 24 h. the primary mode of action of bacteriocin  rc 20975 seems to be the formation of pores, as indicated by k(+) efflux from metabolically active cells of a. acidoterrestris. however, efflux of larger cytoplasmic content was not observed within the first 30 min after bacteriocin rc 20975 treatment. in addition, adsorption of bacteriocin rc 20975 to target cells  at different temperatures and ph levels and in the presence of surfactants was studied. finally, the effect that different media, media components, and addition of vitamins to the media had on bacteriocin rc 20975 production was also studied.

TI  == dynamics and rrna transcriptional activity of lactococci and lactobacilli during  cheddar cheese ripening.
AB  == cheddar cheese is a complex ecosystem where both the bacterial population and the cheese making process contribute to flavor and texture development. the aim of this study was to use molecular methods to evaluate the impact of milk heat treatment and ripening temperature on starter lactococci and non-starter lactic acid bacteria (nslab) throughout ripening of cheddar cheese. eight cheddar cheese batches were manufactured (four with thermized and four with pasteurized milk) and ripened at 4, 7 and 12 degrees c to analyze the bacterial composition and rrna transcriptional activity reflecting the ability of lactococci and lactobacilli to synthesize proteins. abundance and rrna transcription of lactococci and lactobacilli were quantified after dna and rna extraction by using quantitative pcr (qpcr) and reverse transcription-quantitative pcr (rt-qpcr) targeting the 16s rrna gene, respectively. results showed that lactococci remained dominant throughout ripening, although 16s rrna genome and cdna copies/g of cheese decreased by four and two log copy numbers, respectively. abundance and rrna transcription of lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus buchneri/parabuchneri, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus brevis, and lactobacillus coryniformis as well as total lactobacilli were also estimated using specific 16s rrna primers. l. paracasei and l. buchneri/parabuchneri concomitantly grew in cheese made from thermized milk at 7 and 12 degrees c, although l. paracasei displayed the most rrna transcription among lactobacillus species. this work showed that rrna transcriptional activity of lactococci decreased throughout ripening and supports the usefulness of rna analysis to assess which bacterial species have the ability to synthesize proteins during ripening, and could thereby contribute to cheese quality.

TI  == strain-specific probiotics properties of lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus brevis isolates from brazilian food products.
AB  == a total of 234 lab isolates from brazilian food products were initially screened  for their ability to survive at ph 2.0. fifty one of the isolates survived and were selected. they were characterized by phenotypic methods, rep-pcr and identified using 16s rrna gene sequencing as lactobacillus fermentum (34 isolates), lactobacillus plantarum (10) and lactobacillus brevis (7). based on being either highly tolerant to bile, showing an ability for auto-aggregation and/or hydrophobic properties, one l. fermentum (ch58), three l. plantarum (ch3,  ch41 and sau96) and two l. brevis (sau105 and ffc199) were selected. the highest  co-aggregation ability with escherichia coli was observed to l. plantarum ch41. l. brevis sau105 and ffc199 and l. fermentum ch58 exhibited antagonistic activity towards the pathogens listeria monocytogenes and staphylococcus aureus. l. plantarum ch3 and ch41 and l. brevis ffc199 showed adhesion ability to caco-2 cells (1.6, 1.1 and 0.9%, respectively) similar to the commercial probiotic, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg (1.5%). they were able to increase the transepithelial electrical resistance (teer) of caco-2 cells over 24 h (p < 0.05). the present work showed that the probiotic characteristics were strain-specific and that the  isolates l. plantarum ch3 and ch41 (cocoa) and l. brevis ffc199 (cauim) exhibited potential probiotics properties.

TI  == lactobacillus species isolated from vaginal secretions of healthy and bacterial vaginosis-intermediate mexican women: a prospective study.
AB  == background: lactobacillus jensenii, l. iners, l. crispatus and l. gasseri are the most frequently occurring lactobacilli in the vagina. however, the native species vary widely according to the studied population. the present study was performed  to genetically determine the identity of lactobacillus strains present in the vaginal discharge of healthy and bacterial vaginosis (bv) intermediate mexican women. methods: in a prospective study, 31 strains preliminarily identified as lactobacillus species were isolated from 21 samples collected from 105 non-pregnant mexican women. the samples were classified into groups according to  the nugent score criteria proposed for detection of bv: normal (n), intermediate  (i) and bacterial vaginosis (bv). we examined the isolates using culture-based methods as well as molecular analysis of the v1-v3 regions of the 16s rrna gene.  enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (eric) sequence analysis was performed to reject clones. results: clinical isolates (25/31) were classified into four groups based on sequencing and analysis of the 16s rrna gene: l. acidophilus (14/25), l. reuteri (6/25), l. casei (4/25) and l. buchneri (1/25). the remaining six isolates were presumptively identified as enterococcus species. within the l. acidophilus group, l. gasseri was the most frequently isolated species, followed by l. jensenii and l. crispatus. l. fermentum, l. rhamnosus and l. brevis were also isolated, and were placed in the l. reuteri, l. casei and l.  buchneri groups, respectively. eric profile analysis showed intraspecific variability amongst the l. gasseri and l. fermentum species. conclusions: these findings agree with previous studies showing that l. crispatus, l. gasseri and l. jensenii are consistently present in the healthy vaginal ecosystem. additional species or phylotypes were detected in the vaginal microbiota of the non-pregnant mexican (hispanic-mestizo) population, and thus, these results further our understanding of vaginal lactobacilli colonisation and richness in this particular population.

TI  == alleviating effects of lactobacillus strains on pathogenic vibrio parahaemolyticus-induced intestinal fluid accumulation in the mouse model.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate the probiotic effects of lactobacillus strains against vibrio parahaemolyticus causing gastroenteritis. six-week-old icr mice were pretreated with four lactobacillus strains at three dosages, and then challenged with v. parahaemolyticus tgqx01 (serotype o3:k6). the results showed that v. parahaemolyticus tgqx01 caused severe intestinal fluid accumulation (fa)  and villi damage in control mice which were pretreated with phosphate-buffered saline. in contrast, significant alleviation of fa was seen in mice pretreated by with a high dose of lactobacillus strains (p < 0.05, n = 6) but not in mice that  received low-dose pretreatments. among middle-dose treatments, two highly adhesive strains, lactobacillus rhamnosus h15 and lactobacillus brevis y29-4, significantly decreased intestinal fa and villi damage in treated mice (p < 0.05). two low-adhesive strains, lactobacillus acidophilus y14-3 and lactobacillus fermentum f16-6, had no significant alleviating effects. at the same dosing levels, no significant differences in fa were observed in mice pretreated with strains with similar adhesive abilities but different antagonistic activities. our findings suggest that lactobacillus strains can alleviate v. parahaemolyticus-induced intestinal fa in mice, and the doses required for in vivo efficacy depend more on adhesive ability than on the antibacterial activity of strains.

TI  == microbial dynamics of commercial makgeolli depending on the storage temperature.
AB  == market fresh makgeolli was stored at different temperatures of 4 degrees c and 25 degrees c to assess the change of the microbial diversity according to the storage temperature and period. yeast counts increased until day 3 of storage and decreased thereafter. general and lactic acid bacterial counts continuously increased during storage. the data indicated that the control of growth of microorganisms, particularly general bacteria and lactic acid bacteria (lab), is  essential. total acid levels started to decrease in the makgeolli stored at 4 degrees c, and increased from day 6 of storage in the makgeolli stored at 25 degrees c. the increase of total acid in the non-refrigerated condition greatly affected the quality of makgeolli. in both the fresh makgeolli samples stored at  4 degrees c and 25 degrees c, yeast (saccharomyces cerevisiae) and molds (aspergillus tubingensis, candida glaebosa, and aspergillus niger) were noted. denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) band patterns were almost constant regardless of the storage period. as for bacteria, lactobacillus crustorum, l. brevis, and microlaena stipoides were found in the makgeolli stored at 4 degrees  c, and l. crustorum, lactobacillus sp., l. plantarum, l. brevis, l. rhamnosus, and l. similis were found in the makgeolli stored at 25 degrees c. in particular, in the makgeolli stored at 25 degrees c, l. crustorum and l. plantarum presented  dark bands and were identified as the primary microorganisms that affected spoilage of fresh makgeolli.

TI  == effects of bile salt deconjugation by probiotic strains on the survival of antibiotic-resistant foodborne pathogens under simulated gastric conditions.
AB  == this study was designed to evaluate the effects of bile acid deconjugation by probiotic strains on the antibiotic susceptibility of antibiotic-sensitive and multiple antibiotic-resistant salmonella typhimurium and staphylococcus aureus. eight probiotic strains, bifidobacterium longum b6, lactobacillus acidophilus adh, lactobacillus brevis kacc 10553, lactobacillus casei kacc 12413, lactobacillus paracasei atcc 25598, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, leuconostoc mesenteroides kacc 12312, and pediococcus acidilactici kacc 12307, were used to examine bile acid tolerance. the ability to deconjugate bile acids was evaluated  using both thin-layer chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography.  the antibiotic susceptibility testing was carried out to determine the synergistic inhibitory activity of deconjugated bile acids. l. acidophilus, l. brevis, and p. acidilactici showed the most tolerance to the conjugated bile acids. p. acidilactici deconjugated glycocholic acid and glycodeoxycholate from 3.18 and 3.09 mm to the detection limits, respectively. the antibiotic susceptibility of selected foodborne pathogens was increased by increasing the concentration of deconjugated bile acids. the study results are useful for understanding the relationship between bile acid deconjugation by probiotic strains and antibiotic susceptibility in the presence of deconjugated bile acids, and they may be useful for designing new probiotic-antibiotic combination therapy based on bile acid deconjugation.

TI  == phylogenetic analysis of a spontaneous cocoa bean fermentation metagenome reveals new insights into its bacterial and fungal community diversity.
AB  == this is the first report on the phylogenetic analysis of the community diversity  of a single spontaneous cocoa bean box fermentation sample through a metagenomic  approach involving 454 pyrosequencing. several sequence-based and composition-based taxonomic profiling tools were used and evaluated to avoid software-dependent results and their outcome was validated by comparison with previously obtained culture-dependent and culture-independent data. overall, this approach revealed a wider bacterial (mainly gamma-proteobacteria) and fungal diversity than previously found. further, the use of a combination of different classification methods, in a software-independent way, helped to understand the actual composition of the microbial ecosystem under study. in addition, bacteriophage-related sequences were found. the bacterial diversity depended partially on the methods used, as composition-based methods predicted a wider diversity than sequence-based methods, and as classification methods based solely on phylogenetic marker genes predicted a more restricted diversity compared with  methods that took all reads into account. the metagenomic sequencing analysis identified hanseniaspora uvarum, hanseniaspora opuntiae, saccharomyces cerevisiae, lactobacillus fermentum, and acetobacter pasteurianus as the prevailing species. also, the presence of occasional members of the cocoa bean fermentation process was revealed (such as erwinia tasmaniensis, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and oenococcus oeni). furthermore, the sequence reads  associated with viral communities were of a restricted diversity, dominated by myoviridae and siphoviridae, and reflecting lactobacillus as the dominant host. to conclude, an accurate overview of all members of a cocoa bean fermentation process sample was revealed, indicating the superiority of metagenomic sequencing over previously used techniques.

TI  == qualitative and semiquantitative analysis of lactobacillus species in the vaginas of healthy fertile and postmenopausal chinese women.
AB  == the present study aimed to investigate the prevalence and quantity of lactobacillus species in the vaginas of healthy chinese women. vaginal samples from 92 fertile and 22 postmenopausal healthy chinese women were analysed using a 16s rrna gene clone library and species-specific pcr followed by sequencing and real-time pcr. a total of 13 different lactobacillus species were detected. species-specific pcr showed that 3% of the fertile women were colonized by one species of lactobacillus and 97% were colonized by two or more species. among the postmenopausal women, 91% were colonized by one species of lactobacillus and 9% were colonized by two species. in the fertile women, l. iners (82.61%), l. crispatus (70.65%) and l. gasseri (67.39%) were more prevalent than l. jensenii (40.22%), l. acidophilus (39.13%), l. brevis (23.91%), l. plantarum (5.43%), l. johnsonii (3.26%), l. fermentum (2.17%), l. salivarius (2.17%), l. rhamnosus (1.09%), l. reuteri (1.09%) and l. paracasei (1.09%); l. delbrueckii was not detected. in the postmenopausal women, l. fermentum, l. rhamnosus, l. reuteri and l. delbrueckii were not detected, and the other 10 species were detected in just  a few samples. the prevalence of these species according to the clone library differed from the prevalence indicated by the species-specific pcr. according to  the semiquantitative analysis, the total lactobacillus dna concentrations were higher in fertile women than in postmenopausal women. sixty-one per cent of the fertile women were predominantly colonized by l. iners, 35% by l. crispatus, and  2% by l. gasseri. associations between pairs of lactobacillus species in fertile  women were significant (p<0.05) between the following pairs: l. iners and l. gasseri, l. iners and l. jensenii, l. iners and l. acidophilus, l. gasseri and l. acidophilus, and l. gasseri and l. jensenii. in conclusion, this study provided detailed information on lactobacillus species colonizing the vaginas of healthy chinese fertile and postmenopausal women. the study also showed that the diversity of lactobacillus species in fertile women was higher than in postmenopausal women. according to our study, different techniques, such as species-specific pcr and comparison against a 16s rrna gene clone library, resulted in different findings regarding species prevalence. these findings highlight the importance of standardization of techniques used for evaluation of  bacterial communities. according to our findings regarding species associations,  l. iners and l. gasseri may have influences on colonization and proliferation of  other vaginal lactobacillus species.

TI  == evaluation of the functional potential of weissella and lactobacillus isolates obtained from nigerian traditional fermented foods and cow's intestine.
AB  == the characterisation of 24 lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolates from nigerian traditional fermented dairy foods, including some cow's intestine isolates, was conducted in order to select isolates for potential use as probiotics. lab isolates were identified by partial sequencing the 16s rrna gene as belonging to  the species lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus brevis and mainly weissella confusa. at the end of a characterisation process, 2 l. paracasei and 2 w. confusa isolates were selected, and their resistance to a simulated gastrointestinal digestion and their ability to adhere to eukaryotic cell lines were assessed. the survival to the simulated gastrointestinal passage was higher  when bacterial suspensions were made in skimmed milk (2.0+/-0.8 log units reduction) or at the simulated gastric juice ph 3 (2.7+/-0.9 log units reduction) than at ph 2.0 (5.5+/-0.7 log units reduction). adhesion of lab to both intestinal and vaginal epithelial models was comparable or higher than that of the reference lactobacillus rhamnosus gg. however, some of the isolates increased the adhesion of the pathogen escherichia coli lmg2092 to ht-29 and hela monolayers. overall, isolates l. paracasei ui14 and w. confusa ui7 are good candidates for further studying potential benefits that support their use as probiotics. this is one of the few articles reporting the characterisation and the probiotic potential of weissella, although more studies are needed in order to establish their safety for potential probiotic applications.

TI  == bacterial and fungal communities of wilted italian ryegrass silage inoculated with and without lactobacillus rhamnosus or lactobacillus buchneri.
AB  == aims: to understand the effects of lactic acid bacteria (lab) inoculation on fermentation products, aerobic stability and microbial communities of silage. methods and results: wilted italian ryegrass was stored in laboratory silos with  and without inoculation of lactobacillus rhamnosus and lactobacillus buchneri. the silos were opened after 14, 56 and 120 days and then subjected to aerobic deterioration for 7 days. intensive alcoholic fermentation was found in untreated silage; the sum of ethanol and 2,3-butanediol content at day 14 was about 7 times higher than that of lactic and volatile fatty acids. alcoholic fermentation was suppressed by l. rhamnosus and l. buchneri inoculation and lactic acid and acetic acid became the dominant fermentation products, respectively. silages were deteriorated in untreated and l. rhamnosus-inoculated silages, whereas no spoilage was found in l. buchneri-inoculated silage. enterobacteria such as erwinia persicina, pantoea agglomerans and rahnella aquatilis were detected in untreated silage, whereas some of these bacteria disappeared or became faint with l. rhamnosus treatment. when silage was deteriorated, lactobacillus brevis and bacillus pumilus were observed in untreated and l. rhamnosus-inoculated communities, respectively. the inoculated lab species was detectable in addition  to untreated bacterial communities. saccharomyces cerevisiae and pichia anomala were the main fungi in untreated and l. rhamnosus-inoculated silages; however, p. anomala was not visibly seen in l. buchneri-inoculated silage either at silo opening or after exposure to air. conclusion: inoculation with l. rhamnosus can suppress alcoholic fermentation of wilted grass silage with elimination of enterobacteria at the beginning of fermentation. addition of l. buchneri may improve aerobic stability, with distinct inhibitory effect observed on p. anomala after silo opening. significance and impact of the study: bacterial and fungal community analyses help us to understand how inoculated lab can function to improve the fermentation and aerobic stability of silage.

AB  == aims: the anti-infectious activity of lactobacilli against multi-drug resistant salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium dt104 (dt104) was examined in a murine model of an opportunistic antibiotic-induced infection. methods and results: explosive intestinal growth and subsequent lethal extra-intestinal translocation  after oral infection with dt104 during fosfomycin (fom) administration was significantly inhibited by continuous oral administration of lactobacillus casei  strain shirota (lcs), which is naturally resistant to fom, at a dose of 10(8) colony-forming units per mouse daily to mice. comparison of the anti-salmonella activity of several lactobacillus type strains with natural resistance to fom revealed that lactobacillus brevis atcc 14869(t) , lactobacillus plantarum atcc 14917(t) , lactobacillus reuteri jcm 1112(t) , lactobacillus rhamnosus atcc 7469(t) and lactobacillus salivarius atcc 11741(t) conferred no activity even when they obtained the high population levels almost similar to those of the effective strains such as lcs, lact. casei atcc 334(t) and lactobacillus zeae atcc 15820(t) . the increase in concentration of organic acids and maintenance of the lower ph in the intestine because of lactobacillus colonization were correlated with the anti-infectious activity. moreover, heat-killed lcs was not protective against the infection, suggesting that the metabolic activity of lactobacilli is important for the anti-infectious activity. conclusion: these results suggest that certain lactobacilli in combination with antibiotics may be  useful for prophylaxis against opportunistic intestinal infections by multi-drug  resistant pathogens, such as dt104. significance and impact of the study: antibiotics such as fom disrupt the metabolic activity of the intestinal microbiota that produce organic acids, and that only probiotic strains that are metabolically active in vivo should be selected to prevent intestinal infection when used clinically in combination with certain antibiotics.

TI  == lactic acid production from corn stover using mixed cultures of lactobacillus rhamnosus and lactobacillus brevis.
AB  == mixed cultures of lactobacillus rhamnosus and lactobacillus brevis was studied for improving utilization of both cellulose- and hemicellulose-derived sugars from corn stover for lactic acid production. during simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (ssf) of naoh-treated corn stover by the mixed cultures, a lactic acid yield of 0.70 g/g was obtained, which was about 18.6% and 29.6% higher than that by single cultures of l. rhamnosus and l. brevis, respectively.  our results indicated that lactic acid yield from naoh-pretreated corn stover by  mixed cultures of l. rhamnosus and l. brevis was comparable to that from pure sugar mixtures (0.73 g/g of glucose/xylose mixture at 3:1 w/w).

TI  == probiotic table olives: microbial populations adhering on olive surface in fermentation sets inoculated with the probiotic strain lactobacillus paracasei impc2.1 in an industrial plant.
AB  == this study reports the dynamics of microbial populations adhering on the surface  of debittered green olives cv. bella di cerignola in fermentation sets inoculated with the probiotic strain lactobacillus paracasei impc2.1 in different brining conditions (4% and 8% (w/v) nacl) at room temperature and 4 degrees c. the probiotic strain successfully colonized the olive surface dominating the natural  lab population and decreasing the ph of brines to <or=5.0 after 30 days until the end of fermentation. the dynamics of microbial populations associated with olive  surface and belonging to the different groups indicated that inoculated olives held at room temperature did not host enterobacteriaceae at the end of fermentation. yeast populations were present in a low number (<or=log(10) 5.7 cfu/g) throughout the process. a considerable genetic diversity of lab species colonizing the olive surface was found mainly in inoculated set brined in 8% nacl, as indicated by the shannon diversity index calculated for each set. generally, strains of lactobacillus coryniformis, l. paracasei, l. plantarum, l.  pentosus, l. rhamnosus, l. brevis, l. mali, l. vaccinostercus, l.casei, leuconostoc mesenteroides, leuc. pseudomesenteroides, lactococcus lactis, weissella paramesenteroides, w. cibaria, enterococcus casseliflavus group and e.  italicus were identified during the whole process. in particular, l. pentosus was the most frequently isolated species and it showed a high strain diversity throughout fermentation in all processes except for the one held at 4 degrees c.  also a notable incidence of leuc. mesenteroides on olives was highlighted in this study during all fermentation. results indicated that the human strain l. paracasei impc2.1 can be considered an example of a strain used in the dual role  of starter and probiotic culture which allowed the control of fermentation processes and the realization of a final probiotic product with functional appeal.

TI  == lactic acid bacteria population in children diagnosed with human immunodeficiency virus.
AB  == aim: to determine the effect of trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole treatment on the natural population of lactic acid bacteria in the intestinal tract and to determine if any of the strains developed resistance to antibiotics. methods: lactic acid bacteria were isolated from stool samples of 100 children. the isolates were identified based on biochemical characteristics and dna profiles obtained from polymerase chain reaction with genus- and species-specific primers. resistance to sulphamethoxazole, streptomycin, compound sulphonamides, chloramphenicol and vancomycin was tested using the paper-disk method. results: the lactic acid bacteria were identified as lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus pentosus, lactobacillus rhamnosus, leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides, enterococcus spp. and weissella spp. lactobacillus plantarum and bifidobacterium  spp. were not isolated. all strains, except two, were sensitive to chloramphenicol and streptomycin. thirty-five percent of the isolates were resistant to vancomycin, 50% to compound sulphonamides and 66% to sulphamethoxazole. conclusion: treatment with trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole repressed a large number of lactic acid bacteria normally present in the intestinal tract of children. a number of strains were resistant to sulphamethoxazole and may be used as probiotics to correct the imbalance in lactic acid bacteria.

TI  == heme and menaquinone induced electron transport in lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == background: for some lactic acid bacteria higher biomass production as a result of aerobic respiration has been reported upon supplementation with heme and menaquinone. in this report, we have studied a large number of species among lactic acid bacteria for the existence of this trait. results: heme- (and menaquinone) stimulated aerobic growth was observed for several species and genera of lactic acid bacteria. these include lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacilllus brevis, lactobacillus paralimentarius, streptococcus entericus and lactococcus garviae. the increased biomass production without further acidification, which are respiration associated traits, are suitable for high-throughput screening as demonstrated by the screening of 8000 lactococcus lactis insertion mutants. respiration-negative insertion-mutants were found with noxa, bd-type cytochrome and menaquinol biosynthesis gene-disruptions. phenotypic screening and in silico genome analysis suggest that respiration can be considered characteristic for certain species. conclusion: we propose that the cyd-genes were present in the common ancestor of lactic acid bacteria, and that multiple gene-loss events best explains the observed distribution of these genes  among the species.

TI  == diversity of lactic acid bacteria in two flemish artisan raw milk gouda-type cheeses.
AB  == pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge) was used to study the diversity of lactic acid bacteria (lab) in two flemish artisan raw milk gouda-type cheeses. in parallel, conventional culturing was performed. isolates were identified using (gtg)(5)-pcr and sequence analysis of 16s rrna and phes genes. discriminant analysis revealed some differences in overall lab diversity between the two batches and between the two cheeses. within each batch, the diversity of 8- and 12-week-old cheeses was relatively similar. conventional isolation mainly revealed the presence of lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus  plantarum, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus rhamnosus and pediococcus pentosaceus. pcr-dgge revealed the presence of three species of which no isolates were recovered, i.e. enterococcus faecalis, lactobacillus parabuchneri and lactobacillus gallinarum. conversely, not all isolated bacteria were detected by  pcr-dgge. we recommend the integrated use of culture-dependent and -independent approaches to maximally encompass the taxonomic spectrum of lab occurring in gouda-type and other cheeses.

TI  == probiotic properties of lactic acid bacteria isolated from stool samples of longevous people in regions of hotan, xinjiang and bama, guangxi, china.
AB  == a total of 567 lactic acid bacteria (lab) strains were isolated from the stool samples of longevous people in regions of hotan, xinjiang and bama, guangxi, china. in order to reduce the number of strains for further examinations, 36 isolates were screened out for further examination whilst the other strains, which had lower probiotic properties, were not suitable for yogurt production due to the absence of growth in ph 3.5 mrs medium and no curding during fermentation, and so were excluded. the result of identification by api, sequence analysis of 16s rrna and random amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) analysis showed that there were three strains of lactobacillus acidophilus, 10 strains of lactobacillus rhamnosus, three strains of lactobacillus casein, three strains of lactobacillus  brevis, two strains of enterococcus faecium, two strains of enterococcus faecalis, four strains of bifdibacterium infantis, three strains of bifdibacterium brevise, three strains of bifdibacterium bifidium, two strains of  bifdibacterium adolecentis and one strain of bifdibacterium longam among the 36 isolates. these strains were evaluated by in vitro methods including survival upon exposure to ph 2.0, 3.0 and/or 0.3% oxgall and adhesion to the human colon adenocarcinoma cell line caco-2 as well as antimicrobial activity against potential pathogens. the results presented here show that l. rhamnosus lv108, l.  rhamnosus f, b. brevise r39 and b. infantis r42 are acid and bile tolerant, adhere to the cultured human intestinal caco-2 cell line, antagonistic activity against potential pathogenic bacteria infection in vitro, and so are potential strains for probiotic use.

TI  == evidence for in vitro anti-genotoxicity of cheese non-starter lactobacilli.
AB  == the inhibition of direct acting dna reactive agents by 63 non-starter lactobacilli isolated from raw ewes milk cheeses was examined by short-term assay (sos-chromotest) and compared with already characterized starter lactobacilli. the screening revealed strains active against the nitroarene 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (nqo) and the alkylating agent n-methyl-n'-nitro-n-nitrosoguanidine (mnng) in different species of the genus lactobacillus (l. rhamnosus, l. casei, l. plantarum, l. brevis, lactobacillus spp.). it was proved that the anti-genotoxicity was strain-dependent, and always  associated with spectroscopic modification of genotoxins. the frequency of strains inhibiting nitroarene genotoxicity was comparable for non-starter and starter lactobacilli, whereas inhibition of the alkylating agent was largely predominant in non-starter isolates. seventeen strains presented inhibitory activity against both genotoxins. dna rapd-pcr performed with m13, pro-up and rpo2 primers on the lactobacilli under examination showed genetic diversity in these strains. the non-starter isolates clustered in seven groups and the strains presenting a high degree of activity against 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide clustered in a single group with a similarity around 75%. interestingly, the strains with anti-genotoxic properties also showed acid-bile tolerance, indicating that the autochthonous lactobacilli which survive cheese ripening may also reach the gut as viable cells and could prevent genotoxin dna damage to enterocytes, as is desirable for probiotic bacteria.

AB  == efficient selection of new silage inoculant strains from a collection of over 10,000 isolates of lactic acid bacteria (lab) requires excellent strain discrimination. toward that end, we constructed a gelcompar ii database of dna fingerprint patterns of ethidium bromide-stained ecori fragments of total lab dna separated by conventional agarose gel electrophoresis. we found that the total dna patterns were strain-specific; 56/60 american type culture collection strains of 33 species of lab could be distinguished. enterococcus faecium strains atcc19434 and atcc35667 had identical total dna patterns and riboprints. lactobacillus rhamnosus strains atcc7469 and atcc27773 also had identical total dna patterns, but different riboprints. ecori riboprint patterns could distinguish only about 9/23 lactobacillus plantarum strains and about 6/10 lactobacillus buchneri strains, whereas all 33 strains could be distinguished by  ecori total dna patterns. despite gel-to-gel variation, new dna patterns can be readily grouped with existing patterns using gelcompar ii. the database contains  large homogenous clusters of l. plantarum, e. faecium, l. buchneri, lactobacillus brevis and pediococcus species that can be used for tentative taxonomic assignment. we routinely use the dna fingerprint database to identify and characterize new strains, eliminate duplicate isolates and for quality control of inoculant product strains. the gelcompar ii database has been in continuous use for 7 years and contains more than 3600 patterns representing approximately 700 unique patterns from over 300 gels and is the largest computerized dna fingerprint database for lab yet reported.

TI  == the potential of dairy lactic acid bacteria to metabolise amino acids via non-transaminating reactions and endogenous transamination.
AB  == the metabolism of amino acids by 22 starter and 49 non-starter lactic acid bacteria (lab) was studied in a system consisting of amino acids and non-growing  cells without added amino acceptors such as alpha-ketoglutarate. there were significant inter- and intra-species differences in the metabolism of amino acids. some amino acids such as alanine, arginine, aspartate, serine and branched-chain amino acids (leucine, isoleucine and valine) were utilised, whereas other amino acids such as glycine, ornithine and citrulline were produced. alanine and aspartate were utilised by some lab and accumulated during  the incubation of other lab. arginine was degraded not only by lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (the lactococcal subspecies known to catabolise arginine), but also by pediococci, heterofermentative lactobacilli (lactobacillus brevis and lb. fermentum) and some unidentified homofermentative lactobacilli. serine was utilised predominantly by homofermentative lb. paracasei subsp. paracasei, lb. rhamnosus and lb. plantarum. of the lab studied, lb. brevis and lb. fermentum were the most metabolically active, utilising alanine, arginine, aspartate, glutamate and branched-chain amino acids. leuconostocs were the least metabolically active, showing little potential to metabolise amino acids. the formation of ammonia and acetate from amino acid metabolism varied both between species and between strains within species. these findings suggest that the potential of lab for amino acid metabolism via non-transaminating reactions and endogenous transamination will impact both on the physiology of lab and on cheese ripening, especially when transamination is rate-limiting in the absence of an exogenous amino acceptor such as alpha-ketoglutarate.

TI  == characterization of non-starter lactic acid bacteria from italian ewe cheeses based on phenotypic, genotypic, and cell wall protein analyses.
AB  == non-starter lactic acid bacteria (nslab) were isolated from 12 italian ewe cheeses representing six different types of cheese, which in several cases were produced by different manufacturers. a total of 400 presumptive lactobacillus isolates were obtained, and 123 isolates and 10 type strains were subjected to phenotypic, genetic, and cell wall protein characterization analyses. phenotypically, the cheese isolates included 32% lactobacillus plantarum isolates, 15% l. brevis isolates, 12% l. paracasei subsp. paracasei isolates, 9%  l. curvatus isolates, 6% l. fermentum isolates, 6% l. casei subsp. casei isolates, 5% l. pentosus isolates, 3% l. casei subsp. pseudoplantarum isolates, and 1% l. rhamnosus isolates. eleven percent of the isolates were not phenotypically identified. although a randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) analysis based on three primers and clustering by the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic average (upgma) was useful for partially differentiating the 10 type strains, it did not provide a species-specific dna band or a combination of bands which permitted complete separation of all the species considered. in contrast, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis cell wall protein profiles clustered by upgma were species specific and resolved the nslab. the only exceptions were isolates phenotypically identified as l. plantarum and l. pentosus or as l. casei subsp. casei and l. paracasei subsp. paracasei, which were grouped together. based on protein profiles, italian ewe cheeses frequently contained four different species and 3 to 16 strains. in general, the cheeses produced from raw ewe milk contained a larger number of more diverse strains than the cheeses produced from pasteurized  milk. the same cheese produced in different factories contained different species, as well as strains that belonged to the same species but grouped in different rapd clusters.

TI  == assessment of adhesion properties of novel probiotic strains to human intestinal  mucus.
AB  == potential new probiotic strains lactobacillus brevis peli, l. reuteri ing1, l. rhamnosus vtt e-800 and l. rhamnosus lc-705 were assessed for their adhesion properties using the human intestinal mucus model. the effect on the adhesion of  exposure to acid and pepsin and to milk were tested to simulate gastric and food  processing conditions, and the effect of different growth media on adhesion was tested. the properties of the four strains were compared to the well-investigated probiotic l. rhamnosus strain gg. three of the tested strains showed significant  adhesion properties in the mucus model, while l. brevis peli had intermediate adhesion and l. rhamnosus lc-705 adhered poorly. pretreatment with different milks decreased the adhesion and low ph and pepsin treatment reduced the adhesion of all tested strains except l. rhamnosus lc-705. no competitive exclusion of pathogenic salmonella typhimurium or escherichia coli sfaii was observed. the results indicate that major differences exist between tested proposed probiotic strains. the growth media and the food matrix significantly affect the adhesive ability of the tested strains. this has previously not been taken into account when selecting novel probiotic strains.

TI  == comparison of proteolytic activities in various lactobacilli.
AB  == a total of 169 lactobacillus strains from 12 species (lb. acidophilus, lb. brevis, lb. buchneri, lb. casei, lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, lb. delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii, lb. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, lb. fermentum, lb. helveticus, lb. paracasei subsp. paracasei, lb. plantarum and lb. rhamnosus), isolated from raw milk and various milk products, and 9 lactococcus lactis strains were evaluated for peptidase activities with five chromogenic substrates  and a tryptic digest of casein. within each species, the peptidase activity of the cell-free extracts of the strains varied. furthermore, differences were observed between the lactobacillus species and lc. lactis. lb. helveticus had by  far the highest hydrolysing activities towards all substrates, indicating the presence of powerful aminopeptidases, x-prolyl-dipeptidyl aminopeptidases and proline iminopeptidases. lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus possessed high hydrolysing activities towards substrates containing proline, alanyl-prolyl-p-nitroanilide and prolyl-p-nitroanilide. on the other hand, lb. fermentum and lb. brevis could be considered as weakly proteolytic species. a more detailed study with highly proteolytic lactobacillus strains indicated that  at least three different proteinases or endopeptidases were present. compared with lc. lactis, the lactobacillus strains had a much lower hydrolytic action on  glutamyl-glutamic acid, suggesting that glutamyl aminopeptidase was absent in lactobacilli.

TI  == nucleic acids of species of lactobacillus.
AB  == nucleic acid composition of 17 cultures representing the type or neotype strains  of 15 named lactobacillus species was studied. nucleic acid characterization of these isolates was accompanied by a comparative study of conventional phenotypic  reactions. the overall guanine plus cytosine mean deoxyribonucleic acid base composition ranged from 33 to 50% and genome sizes varied between 700 and 1500 x  10(6) daltons. sporolactobacillus inulinus contained 2500 x 10(6) daltons of chromosomal deoxyribonucleic acid and was therefore similar in size to members of the genus bacillus. deoxyribonucleic acid hybridization at a temperature 15 degrees c below the thermal melting temperature confirmed the extreme molecular heterogeneity of many species. the genus can be divided into three major groups,  each containing four or more species based on a combination of nucleic acid characteristics and conventional phenotypic reactions. group i (33 to 39% guanine plus cytosine) contains lactobacillus jensenii, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus helveticus nov. ssp. jugurt, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus salivarius, and lactobacillus sanfrancisco. group ii (42 to 48% guanine plus cytosine contains lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus,  lactobacillus casei, and lactobacillus brevis, and group iii (48 to 50% guanine plus cytosine) contains lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus delbrueckii nov. ssp. bulgaricus, lactobacillus delbrueckii nov. ssp. lactis, lactobacillus delbrueckii nov. ssp. leichmanii, lactobacillus fermentum, and lactobacillus fermentum nov. ssp. cellobiosis.
