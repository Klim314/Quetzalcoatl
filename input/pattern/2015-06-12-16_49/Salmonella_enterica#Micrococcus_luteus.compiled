TI  - Identification and antimicrobial activity detection of lactic Acid bacteria isolated from corn stover silage.
AB  - A total of 59 lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains were isolated from corn stover silage. According to phenotypic and chemotaxonomic characteristics, 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) sequences and recA gene polymerase chain reaction amplification, these LAB isolates were identified as five species: Lactobacillus (L.) plantarum subsp. plantarum, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Enterococcus mundtii, Weissella cibaria and Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, respectively. Those strains were also screened for antimicrobial activity using a dual-culture agar plate assay. Based on excluding the effects of organic acids and hydrogen peroxide, two L. plantarum subsp. plantarum strains ZZU 203 and 204, which strongly inhibited Salmonella enterica ATCC 43971(T), Micrococcus luteus ATCC 4698(T) and Escherichia coli ATCC 11775(T) were selected for further research on sensitivity of the antimicrobial substance to heat, pH and protease. Cell-free culture supernatants of the two strains exhibited strong heat stability (60 min at 100 degrees C), but the antimicrobial activity was eliminated after treatment at 121 degrees C for 15 min. The antimicrobial substance remained active under acidic condition (pH 2.0 to 6.0), but became inactive under neutral and alkaline condition (pH 7.0 to 9.0). In addition, the antimicrobial activities of these two strains decreased remarkably after digestion by protease K. These results preliminarily suggest that the desirable antimicrobial activity of strains ZZU 203 and 204 is the result of the production of a bacteriocin-like substance, and these two strains with antimicrobial activity could be used as silage additives to inhibit proliferation of unwanted microorganism during ensiling and preserve nutrients of silage. The nature of the antimicrobial substances is being investigated in our laboratory.
TI  - Improved antimicrobial activities of synthetic-hybrid bacteriocins designed from  enterocin E50-52 and pediocin PA-1.
AB  - Two hybrid bacteriocins, enterocin E50-52/pediocin PA-1 (EP) and pediocin PA-1/enterocin E50-52 (PE), were designed by combining the N terminus of enterocin E50-52 and the C terminus of pediocin PA-1 and by combining the C terminus of pediocin PA-1 and the N terminus of enterocin E50-52, respectively. Both hybrid bacteriocins showed reduced MICs compared to those of their natural counterparts. The MICs of hybrid PE and EP were 64- and 32-fold lower, respectively, than the MIC of pediocin PA-1 and 8- and 4-fold lower, respectively, than the MIC of enterocin E50-52. In this study, the effect of hybrid as well as wild-type (WT) bacteriocins on the transmembrane electrical potential (DeltaPsi) and their ability to induce the efflux of intracellular ATP were investigated. Enterocin E50-52, pediocin PA-1, and hybrid bacteriocin PE were able to dissipate DeltaPsi, but EP was unable to deplete this component. Both hybrid bacteriocins caused a loss of the intracellular concentration of ATP. EP, however, caused a faster efflux than PE and enterocin E50-52. Enterocin E50-52 and hybrids PE and EP were active against the Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria tested, such as Micrococcus luteus, Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis 20E1090, and Escherichia coli O157:H7. The hybrid bacteriocins designed and described herein are antimicrobial peptides with MICs lower those of their natural counterparts. Both hybrid peptides induce the loss of intracellular ATP and are capable of inhibiting Gram-negative bacteria, and PE dissipates the electrical potential. In this study, the MIC of hybrid bacteriocin PE decreased 64-fold compared to the MIC of its natural peptide counterpart, pediocin PA-1. Inhibition of Gram-negative pathogens confers an additional advantage for the application of these peptides in therapeutics.
TI  - Further in vitro evaluation of antiradical and antimicrobial activities of phytol.
AB  - The antiradical activity of phytol was evaluated by electron paramagnetic resonance towards hydroxyl radical (.OH), superoxide anion radical (.O2(-)), methoxy radical (.CH2OH), carbon-dioxide anion radical (.CO2(-)), as well as towards nitric-oxide radical (.NO) and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (.DPPH) radical. It reduced the production of all tested radicals showing more promising activity against .CO2(-), .CH2OH and .DPPH radicals (56%, 50% and 48%, respectively) in comparison with .NO, .O2(-) and .OH radicals (38%, 23% and 15%, respectively). The antimicrobial activity of phytol was evaluated by the microdilution method against eight bacterial and eight fungal strains. To varying degrees, it was proven to be active against all tested bacteria and fungi (MIC 0.003-0.038 mg/mL and MBC 0.013-0.052 mg/mL, MIC 0.008-0.016 mg/mL and MFC 0.090-0.520 mg/mL, respectively). According to the obtained results, medical foods containing phytol may support development of new therapies for heart disease.
TI  - cgMolluscidin, a novel dibasic residue repeat rich antimicrobial peptide, purified from the gill of the Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas.
AB  - A 5.5 kDa antimicrobial peptide consisting of 55 amino acids, cgMolluscidin, was  purified from the acidified gill extract of the Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas, by ion-exchange and C18 reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography. By comparing the N-terminal amino acid sequences and the molecular weight of this peptide with those of other known antimicrobial peptides, it has been revealed that this peptide had no homology with any known peptides. cgMolluscidin showed potent antimicrobial activity against both Gram-positive bacteria, including Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, and Staphylococcus aureus (minimal effective concentrations [MECs]; 1.3-31.3 mug/mL), and Gram-negative bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, and Vibrio parahaemolyticus ([MECs]; 0.4-2.3 mug/mL), without hemolytic activity. However, cgMolluscidin did not show any significant activity against Candida albicans. The deduced amino acid sequence of the cgMolluscidin showed no hit in public protein databases, while the nucleotide sequence had a 99% homology (E value = 0) with only the unknown ESTs sequenced by C. gigas EST project. Tissue distribution of the cgMolluscidin mRNA suggests that it is constitutively expressed as a mature form in a non-tissue-specific manner. The cgMolluscidin mRNA expression level was significantly up-regulated at 12 h (2.8-fold) post injection with Vibrio sp. This peptide is highly basic and contains several dibasic residue repeats including Lysine-Lysine or Lysine-Arginine in the sequence, but may not form an ordered structure. These results suggest that cgMolluscidin might be an oyster-specific novel antimicrobial peptide.
TI  - New sub-family of lysozyme-like proteins shows no catalytic activity: crystallographic and biochemical study of STM3605 protein from Salmonella Typhimurium.
AB  - Phage viruses that infect prokaryotes integrate their genome into the host chromosome; thus, microbial genomes typically contain genetic remnants of both recent and ancient phage infections. Often phage genes occur in clusters of atypical G+C content that reflect integration of the foreign DNA. However, some phage genes occur in isolation without other phage gene neighbors, probably resulting from horizontal gene transfer. In these cases, the phage gene product is unlikely to function as a component of a mature phage particle, and instead may have been co-opted by the host for its own benefit. The product of one such gene from Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, STM3605, encodes a protein with modest sequence similarity to phage-like lysozyme (N-acetylmuramidase) but appears to lack essential catalytic residues that are strictly conserved in all lysozymes. Close homologs in other bacteria share this characteristic. The structure of the STM3605 protein was characterized by X-ray crystallography, and functional assays showed that it is a stable, folded protein whose structure closely resembles lysozyme. However, this protein is unlikely to hydrolyze peptidoglycan. Instead, STM3605 is presumed to have evolved an alternative function because it shows some lytic activity and partitions to micelles.
TI  - Effects of parabens and isothiazolinone on the microbiological quality of baby shampoo: the challenge test.
AB  - An in vitro microbial challenge test has been developed to predict the likelihood of consumer contamination of baby shampoo. Four preservatives were tested in our study: the parbens Medcide D, Medcide PB, Sepicide HB. and isothiazolinone Methylisothiazolinone/Chloromethylisothiazolinone [MI/MCI]. These preservatives were tested separately and in combination. The challenge test involved inoculating the product with Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Aspergillus brasiliensis and Candida albicans. Inhibition growth of these microorganisms at each preservative concentration was followed over a 28 d period. The test was used to classify products as poorly preserved, marginally preserved, or well-preserved. Interestingly, it was the combination (0.1% Isothiazolinone [MI/MCI] and 0.1% Sepicide HB) which inhibited most the microbial growth of microorganims while preserving the physicochemical properties of the product. As a result, the challenge test described can be accurately used to predict the risk of consumer contamination of cosmetic products.
TI  - Antibacterial effect of phosphates and polyphosphates with different chain length.
AB  - The aim of this study was to monitor the antibacterial effect of seven phosphate  salts on selected strains of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, which could be considered responsible for food-borne diseases (Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Citrobacter freundii, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella enterica ser. Enteritidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). For these purposes, phosphates differing in chain length were used. The tested concentrations were in the range of 0.1-2.0% (wt v(-1)) applied at the model conditions. In the majority of cases the visible inhibitory effect on the growth of observed microorganisms could be seen. Due to the chemical structure of salts and their dissociation both the pH values of cultivation broth and similarly the growth characteristics of bacterial strains were affected. The inhibition of above mentioned bacteria was apparently supported by this dissociation. Phosphates obviously made the development of most Gram-positive bacteria impossible. Especially Micrococcus luteus was extremely sensitive to the presence of these substances. On the other hand, Gram-negative bacteria seemed to be resistant to the phosphate incidence. The exemption clause from the tested salts was represented by a high alkaline trisodium phosphate. It should be pointed out that generally the most significant antibacterial effects were shown by polyphosphates HEXA68 and HEXA70, trisodium phosphate undecahydrate, tetrasodium pyrophosphate and finally trisodium phosphate. By comparing the inhibitory effects of various phosphate salts can be concluded that the antibacterial activity was not determined only by the condensation degree but there was also proved the dependence on pH values.
TI  - An expeditious regioselective synthesis of novel bioactive indole-substituted chromene derivatives via one-pot three-component reaction.
AB  - Novel fused 1H-benzo[f]chromen-indole derivatives were synthesized regioselectivly in good to high yields by triethyl amine catalyzed condensation of 3-cyanoacetylindoles, beta-naphthol and aryl aldehydes in methanol under ultrasounic irradiations and conventional conditions. The easy work-up of the products, rapidity, and mild reaction conditions are notable features of this protocol. The antibacterial activity of the selected products was examined. Some products showed promising activities.
TI  - Identification of a new Bacillus licheniformis strain producing a bacteriocin-like substance.
AB  - The emergence of antibiotic resistance has spurred a great number of studies for  development of new antimicrobials in the past decade. The purpose of this study was to screen environmental samples for Bacillus strains producing potent antimicrobial agents. A new strain, which showed strong antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella enterica ser. Pullorum, was isolated from soil and designated as B116. This new isolate was identified as Bacillus licheniformis by morphological, biochemical and genetic analyses. The production of bacteriocin-like substance (BLS) started at early exponential phase and achieved highest level at early stationary phase. The BLS was precipitated by ammonium sulfate and its molecular mass was determined as approximately 4 kDa by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Culture supernatant of the new isolate exhibited antimicrobial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, Micrococcus luteus, Escherichia coli, and Salmonella spp. The BLS was resistant to heat, acid and alkaline treatment. Activity of the BLS was totally lost after digestion by pronase and partially lost after digestion by papain and lipase. The new isolate and relevant BLS are potentially useful in food and feed applications.
TI  - Enzymes of SPZ7 phage: isolation and properties.
AB  - Bacteriophage enzyme preparations exolysin and endolysin were studied. Exolysin (a phage-associated enzyme) was obtained from tail fraction and endolysin from phage-free cytoplasmic fraction of disintegrated Salmonella enteritidis cells. A new method for purification of these enzymes was developed, and their molecular masses were determined. The main catalytic properties of the studied enzymes (pH optimum and specificity to bacterial substrates) were found to be similar. Both enzymes lyse Escherichia coli cells like chicken egg lysozyme, but more efficiently lyse S. enteritidis cells and cannot lyse Micrococcus luteus, a good substrate for chicken egg lysozyme. Similar properties of exolysin and endolysin suggest that these enzymes are structurally similar or even identical.
TI  - Antibacterial effects of the essential oils of commonly consumed medicinal herbs  using an in vitro model.
AB  - The chemical composition and antibacterial activity of essential oils from 10 commonly consumed herbs: Citrus aurantium, C. limon, Lavandula angustifolia, Matricaria chamomilla, Mentha piperita, M. spicata, Ocimum basilicum, Origanum vulgare, Thymus vulgaris and Salvia officinalis have been determined. The antibacterial activity of these oils and their main components; i.e. camphor, carvacrol, 1,8-cineole, linalool, linalyl acetate, limonene, menthol, a-pinene, b-pinene, and thymol were assayed against the human pathogenic bacteria Bacillus subtilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Micrococcus flavus, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enteritidis, S. epidermidis, S. typhimurium, and Staphylococcus aureus. The highest and broadest activity was shown by O. vulgare oil. Carvacrol had the highest antibacterial activity among the tested components.
TI  - Discorhabdins from the Korean marine sponge Sceptrella sp.
AB  - Two new pyrroloiminoquinone alkaloids of the discorhabdin class, along with 12 compounds including one previously described synthetic derivative of the same and related skeletal classes, were isolated from the sponge Sceptrella sp., collected from Gageodo, Korea. The structures of these new compounds, designated as (-)-3-dihydrodiscorhabdin D (11) and (-)-discorhabdin Z (12), were determined by combined spectroscopic analyses. Compound 12 possesses an unusual hemiaminal group among the discorhabdin alkaloids. These compounds exhibited moderate to significant cytotoxicity, antibacterial activity, and inhibitory activity against sortase A.
TI  - Mitracarpus frigidus aerial parts exhibited potent antimicrobial, antileishmanial, and antioxidant effects.
AB  - The crude extract and the hexane, CH(2)Cl(2), EtOAc, n-BuOH, and hydromethanolic  fractions of the aerial parts of Mitracarpus frigidus were evaluated against promastigote forms of two species of Leishmania (L. chagasi and L. amazonensis), 11 strains of bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enterica sorovar Tythimurium, Shigella sonnei, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterobacter cloacae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Bacillus cereus) and two yeasts (Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans). The antioxidant activity (DPPH radical scavenging activity and reducing power), cytotoxicity against mammalian cells, and the contents of phenolics and flavonoids were determined. Phytochemical analysis of the major groups of phytoconstituents is also reported. All samples showed antioxidant activity which was positively correlated to the content of phenolic compounds. S. sonnei, B. cereus and C. neoformans were susceptible to all extracts tested, except for the n-BuOH and hydromethanolic fractions, which demonstrated no antimicrobial activity. The lowest MIC was recorded for the CH(2)Cl(2) fraction against C. neoformans (MIC of 10 microg/ml), followed by B. cereus, S. sonnei, and E. cloacae (MIC of 20, 39 and 39 microg/ml, respectively). The CH(2)Cl(2) fraction was the most effective against L. chagasi (IC(50) of 6.7 microg/ml), and the hydromethanolic fraction exhibited the best activity against L. amazonensis (IC(50) of 9 microg/ml). A cytotoxic effect on mammalian cells was observed only for the crude extract and CH(2)Cl(2) fraction at the concentrations of 130 and 31 microg/ml, respectively. These results suggest that M. frigidus has interesting antimicrobial, antileishmanial and antioxidant activities.
TI  - Bovine hemoglobin: an attractive source of antibacterial peptides.
AB  - A peptic hemoglobin hydrolysate was fractioned by a semi-preparative reversed-phase HPLC and some fractions have an antibacterial activity against four bacteria strains: Micrococcus luteus A270, Listeria innocua, Escherichia coli and Salmonella enteritidis. These fractions were analyzed by ESI/MS and ESI/MS/MS, in order to characterize the peptides in these fractions. Each fraction contains at least three peptides and some fractions contain five peptides. All these fractions were purified several times by HPLC to obtain pure peptides. Thirty antibacterial peptides were identified. From the isolated antibacterial peptides, 24 peptides were derived from the alpha chains of hemoglobin and 6 peptides were derived from the beta chains of hemoglobin. The lowest concentration of these peptides (minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)) necessary to completely inhibit the growth of four bacteria strain was determined. The cell population of all of the tested bacteria species decreased by at least 97% after a 24-h incubation with any of the peptides at the minimum inhibitory concentration.
TI  - Synthesis, structure and biological activities of cobalt(II) and zinc(II) coordination compounds with 2-benzimidazole derivatives.
AB  - In this work we present the synthesis, structural and spectroscopic characterisation of a series of cobalt(II) and zinc(II) coordination compounds with benzimidazole (bz) and its 2-benzimidazole derivatives: 2-aminobenzimidazole (2ab), albendazole (abz) and tris(2-benzimidazolylmethyl)amine (ntb). The compounds were evaluated for their in vitro antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Micrococcus luteus, Salmonella typhi, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Proteus vulgaris. Their cytotoxic activity was also evaluated using human cancer lines, HeLa, HCT-15 and SKLU-1. The halide tetrahedral compounds [Co(bz)2Br2] 3, [Zn(2ab)2Cl2].0.5H2O 11, [Co(abz)Cl2(H2O)].3H2O 14, [Co(abz)Br2(H2O)] 15, [Zn(abz)Cl2(H2O)].3H2O 17 and [Zn(abz)Br2(H2O)].H2O 18 displayed similar minimal inhibition concentration (MIC) values against Micrococcus luteus and Escherichia coli, comparable to those of amoxicillin and chloramphenicol. Additionally, 11 showed a wide range of activity towards Gram(+) and Gram(-) microorganisms. The tetradentate ntb and its trigonal bipyramidal cobalt(II) and zinc(II) compounds were active, regardless of the anion present in the complex. Compound [Co(abz)Cl2(H2O)].3H2O 14 showed promising activity in HeLa cells, while [Co(ntb)Br]Br.H2O 21 inhibited Hela and HCT-15 cell lines.
TI  - Characterization of Antarctic psychrotrophic bacteria with antibacterial activities against terrestrial microorganisms.
AB  - Five-hundreds and eighty bacterial strains, isolated from various Antarctic marine sources and locations, were screened for antimicrobial activity against terrestrial microorganisms. Twenty-two Antarctic isolates (3.8%), mainly retrieved from the water column at Terra Nova Bay (Ross Sea), expressed antagonistic activity against one to three indicator organisms. Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis resulted as the more susceptible, followed by Micrococcus luteus and Bacillus subtilis. None of the isolates inhibited the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella enterica and the eukaryotic fungus Candida albicans. Active Antarctic isolates, identified by 16S rDNA sequencing and phenotypically characterized by classical methods, were phylogenetically affiliated to the Actinobacteria (16 strains) and the gamma-Proteobacteria (6 strains). Inhibition patterns, as well as phenotypic characteristics, highly vary for different isolates, even though they were affiliated to the same genus or closely related to the identical microorganism retrieved from the database, suggesting that these features were more likely strain-rather than species-specific.Results obtained from the present study confirm previous observations and highlight the potentiality of Antarctic marine bacteria as novel source of antibacterial substances.
TI  - The geomicrobiology of gold.
AB  - Microorganisms capable of actively solubilizing and precipitating gold appear to  play a larger role in the biogeochemical cycling of gold than previously believed. Recent research suggests that bacteria and archaea are involved in every step of the biogeochemical cycle of gold, from the formation of primary mineralization in hydrothermal and deep subsurface systems to its solubilization, dispersion and re-concentration as secondary gold under surface conditions. Enzymatically catalysed precipitation of gold has been observed in thermophilic and hyperthermophilic bacteria and archaea (for example, Thermotoga maritime, Pyrobaculum islandicum), and their activity led to the formation of gold- and silver-bearing sinters in New Zealand's hot spring systems. Sulphate-reducing bacteria (SRB), for example, Desulfovibrio sp., may be involved in the formation of gold-bearing sulphide minerals in deep subsurface environments; over geological timescales this may contribute to the formation of economic deposits. Iron- and sulphur-oxidizing bacteria (for example, Acidothiobacillus ferrooxidans, A. thiooxidans) are known to breakdown gold-hosting sulphide minerals in zones of primary mineralization, and release associated gold in the process. These and other bacteria (for example, actinobacteria) produce thiosulphate, which is known to oxidize gold and form stable, transportable complexes. Other microbial processes, for example, excretion of amino acids and cyanide, may control gold solubilization in auriferous top- and rhizosphere soils. A number of bacteria and archaea are capable of actively catalysing the precipitation of toxic gold(I/III) complexes. Reductive precipitation of these complexes may improve survival rates of bacterial populations that are capable of (1) detoxifying the immediate cell environment by detecting, excreting and reducing gold complexes, possibly using P-type ATPase efflux pumps as well as membrane vesicles (for example, Salmonella enterica, Cupriavidus (Ralstonia) metallidurans, Plectonema boryanum); (2) gaining metabolic energy by utilizing gold-complexing ligands (for example, thiosulphate by A. ferrooxidans) or (3) using gold as metal centre in enzymes (Micrococcus luteus). C. metallidurans containing biofilms were detected on gold grains from two Australian sites, indicating that gold bioaccumulation may lead to gold biomineralization by forming secondary 'bacterioform' gold. Formation of secondary octahedral gold crystals from gold(III) chloride solution, was promoted by a cyanobacterium (P. boryanum) via an amorphous gold(I) sulphide intermediate. 'Bacterioform' gold and secondary gold crystals are common in quartz pebble conglomerates (QPC), where they are often associated with bituminous organic matter possibly derived from cyanobacteria. This may suggest that cyanobacteria have played a role in the formation of the Witwatersrand QPC, the world's largest gold deposit.
TI  - Bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances from Campylobacter spp.
AB  - Twenty-five Campylobacter isolates were screened for production of antimicrobial  substances using a deferred antagonism assay. Sixteen isolates showed activity against either Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis or Candida albicans. The inhibitory activity was sensitive to treatment with pronase E, trypsin and pepsin, suggesting that the antimicrobial compound(s) are proteinaceous. Activity spectra of isolates included S. aureus, Micrococcus luteus, Streptococcus sp., Bacillus subtilis, a drug-resistant clinical isolate of S. aureus and one isolate of C. albicans. Producing isolates showed cross-immunity and inhibitory activity was only observed on solid media. The findings of this study suggest that Campylobacter produces proteinaceous inhibitory substances.
TI  - Resuscitation of the viable but non-culturable state of Salmonella enterica serovar Oranienburg by recombinant resuscitation-promoting factor derived from Salmonella Typhimurium strain LT2.
AB  - A gene encoding the resuscitation-promoting factor (Rpf) from Salmonella Typhimurium LT2 was cloned and characterized. The amino acid sequence encoded by S. Typhimurium LT2 rpf gene shares 24.2% homology with Micrococcus luteus Rpf, which is secreted by growing cells, and required to resuscitate from viable but non-culturable (VNC) state. The S. Typhimurium LT2 rpf gene is 696 bp long, and shared a conserved segment with Salmonella enterica serovar Oranienburg (99.4%). Recombinant Rpf (rRpf) proteins of S. Typhimurium LT2 after expression in E. coli BL21 harboring the pET15-b plasmid was approximately 25 kDa. Since S. Oranienburg cells are relatively quick to enter the VNC state just after incubating in the presence of 7% NaCl at 37 degrees C for 3 days, we evaluated the biological effect of rRpf by using S. Oranienburg VNC cells. The rRpf not only promoted proliferation but also induced resuscitation of VNC cells to the culturable state in a dose-dependent manner. Therefore, rRpf may be useful for detection of bacterial contaminants present in the VNC form in food samples and the environment.
TI  - New antibacterial peptide derived from bovine hemoglobin.
AB  - Peptic digestion of bovine hemoglobin at low degree of hydrolysis yields an intermediate peptide fraction exhibiting antibacterial activity against Micrococcus luteus A270, Listeria innocua, Escherichia coli and Salmonella enteritidis after separation by reversed-phase HPLC. From this fraction a pure peptide was isolated and analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) and electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS). This peptide correspond to the 107-136 fragment of the alpha chain of bovine hemoglobin. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) towards the four strains and its hemolytic activity towards bovine erythrocytes were determined. A MIC of 38 microM was reported against L. innocua and 76 microM for other various bacterial species. This peptide had no hemolytic activity up to 380 microM concentration.
TI  - Synthesis and study of antibacterial and antifungal activities of novel 2-[[(benzoxazole/benzimidazole-2-yl)sulfanyl] acetylamino]thiazoles.
AB  - Several 2-[[(benzoxazole/benzimidazole-2-yl)sulfanyl]acetylamino]thiazoles derivatives were synthesized by reacting 4-substituted-2-(chloroacetylamino)thiazoles with benzoxazole/benzimidazole-2-thioles in acetone and in the presence of K2CO3. The chemical structures of the compounds were elucidated by IR, 1H-NMR, and FAB(+)-MS spectral data. Their antimicrobial activities against Micrococcus luteus (NRLL B-4375), Bacillus cereus (NRRL B-3711), Proteus vulgaris (NRRL B-123), Salmonella typhimurium (NRRL B-4420), Staphylococcus aureus (NRRL B-767), Escherichia coli (NRRL B-3704), Candida albicans and Candida globrata (isolates obtained from Osmangazi Uni. Fac.of Medicine) were investigated and in this investigation, a significant level of activity was illustrated.
TI  - [Interaction of neomycin with other antibiotics on selected bacterial strains].
AB  - Antimicrobial combinations are used most frequently to provide broad-spectrum empirical coverage in the treatment of bacterial infections. However, combination of two antibiotics may not influence their activity, may lead to synergy or antagonism in the activity. Neomycin may be combined with one of the following antibiotics: ampicillin, procaine penicillin, gramicidin, bacitracin, polymyxin B, lincomycin, oxytetracycline, and erythromycin in some human and veterinary multiantibiotic drugs distributed in Poland. The checkerboard method has been one of the traditional assays for the measurement of antibiotic interactions. The aim of this study was to analyse the activity interaction of neomycin with second antibiotic in multiantibiotic drugs distributed in Poland on standards and clinical bacterial strains. Checkerboard results for all strains demonstrated synergism for 2.5% of combinations, only for standards strains. In one case Salmonella Enteritidis, in combination of neomycin with bacitracin, inhibition effect was observed. Additive effects were predominant--49%. In 18% neutral effects were shown, but in 26% of combinations FIC indexes were not possible to calculate, because of the resistance of clinical strains to the highest concentration of at least one antibiotic. In combination of aminoglycoside (neomycin) with beta-lactams antibiotics (ampicillin, procaine penicillin) in vitro, no synergy was observed for all examined strains. The best results were achieved for combinations of neomycin with peptide antibiotics (polymyxin, gramicidin and bacitracin)--5 for all 6 synergy effect observed.
TI  - Correlation of the antibacterial activities of cationic peptide antibiotics and cationic steroid antibiotics.
AB  - The antibacterial activities of cationic steroid antibiotics and cationic peptide antibiotics have been compared. Depolarization of bacterial membranes, activation of bacterial stress-related gene promoters, and changes in bacterial morphologies caused by these antibiotics suggest that cationic steroid and peptide antibiotics share mechanistic aspects. Modified cationic steroid antibiotics display improved selectivity for prokaryotic cells over eukaryotic cells presumably due to increased charge recognition.
TI  - cDNA cloning and antibacterial activities of cecropin D-like peptides from Agrius convolvuli.
AB  - We have characterized full-length cDNAs encoding two isoforms of agriusin, cecropin D-like antibacterial peptide, present in the hemolymph of the immunized Agrius convolvuli larvae. The cloned cDNAs of agriusins 1 and 2 contain 331 and 329 bp, respectively. The nucleotide sequencing of cDNAs showed that they encode 62 amino acids, whose mature portion was deduced to consist of 38 amino acid residues with over 94% sequence identity. In the sequence homology search, mature agriusin 1 showed over 86 and 71% amino acid sequence homology with bactericidin 4 from Manduca sexta and cecropin D from Hyalophora cecropia, respectively. Since it was demonstrated from the deduced amino acid sequences that the C-terminal residues of agriusins are followed by a Gly residue, two types of synthetic agriusin 1 (syn-agriusin 1 amide and acid) were prepared to verify if natural agriusin 1 is C-terminally amidated. From acid-urea PAGE and reversed phase HPLC profiles to compare two synthetic peptides, we could confirm that the C-terminal amino acid residue of natural agriusin 1, like several cecropins so far identified, is amidated. Finally, our antibacterial assay performed with two syn-agriusins 1 revealed that there is little difference between antibacterial activities of both peptides against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Effect of chelators and nisin produced in situ on inhibition and inactivation of  gram negatives.
AB  - The ability of chelators and nisin generated in situ to inhibit and inactivate E. coli and other gram negatives in a model substrate was investigated. The effect of various chelators and different concentrations of exogenous nisin on inhibition of E. coli in broth medium showed that only EDTA and pyrophosphates were able to cause appreciable inhibition of E. coli by nisin. In a broth where L. lactis NCFB 497 produced nisin in a concentration of 250-300 IU/ml, pyrophosphates were unable to inactivate E. coli. Under the same conditions, addition of EDTA led to inactivation of E. coli at neutral and slightly acidic pH only. A cocktail of strains of E. coli was less sensitive than E. coli ATCC 25922 alone. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was more sensitive and salmonellae more resistant. EDTA also caused a slight reduction in the L. lactis population and its biochemical activity as regards pH drop and acid production. Some of the inhibition of E. coli could be ascribed to the physical presence of Lactococcus cells rather than their metabolites excreted into the medium. Failure to observe any inhibition in fermented broths at their natural pH (4.0) was ascribed to the poor chelating power of EDTA under acid conditions.
TI  - [Effect of ozone on airborne microorganisms].
AB  - The microbicidal effect of ozone in air was tested at concentrations between 50 and 600 micrograms/m3 against the species: Staphylococcus epidermidis, Micrococcus luteus, Arthrobacter citreus, Bacillus subtilis (veg.), Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas fluorescens and Candida albicans. The microorganisms were exposed on membrane filters at 60-75% relative humidity and 21.5-22.5 degrees C. After exposure times between 1 min and 60 min, the filters were incubated on appropriate agar media. The effect of ozone was determined by comparing the number of colonies on exposed filters to the number on nonexposed filters. The die-off curves (colony count against time) proved not to be rectilinear, but to become steeper with increasing time of exposure. Furthermore, the velocity of reduction increased more than proportional with increasing concentration of ozone. Therefore, the bacterial decay seems not to follow first order reaction kinetics. The values presented for k (constant of the velocity of die-off) and D (decimal reduction time) are valid only for narrow ranges of the initial part of the exposure. Concentrations of 50 to 100 micrograms (0)3/m3 for 1 h resulted only in little reduction, whereas 500 to 600 micrograms/m3 for one hour led to 99% reduction in all bacterial species tested. The gram-positive species seemed to be more sensitive than the gram-negative species, C. albicans proved to be more resistant than the bacteria.

AB  - Bacterial lipid macroamphiphiles extracted with phenol/water can be purified in one step by hydrophobic interaction chromatography. Lipids and the major part of protein are separated from macroamphiphiles during phenol/water extraction. Coextracted nucleic acids, polysaccharides, and residual protein are effectively removed by column chromatography on octyl-Sepharose whereby macroamphiphiles are primarily adsorbed and later eluted with a buffered propanol gradient. The procedure is applicable to macroamphiphiles with various lipid structures as was demonstrated using the diacylglycerol-containing lipoglycan of Micrococcus luteus, the lipid A-containing lipopolysaccharide of Salmonella typhimurium, and the diglyceryl tetraether lipoglycans of Thermoplasma acidophilum and Thermoplasma volcanicum. On elution from octyl-Sepharose, separation into molecular species of different compositions was observed with the lipopolysaccharide of S. typhimurium and the lipoglycan of T. volcanicum. It was also shown that, after phenol/water extraction, membrane lipids are completely recoverable from the phenol layer, which makes it possible to isolate lipids along with macroamphiphiles from the same sample of bacteria.
