TI  == effect of in-feed administration and withdrawal of tylosin phosphate on antibiotic resistance in enterococci isolated from feedlot steers.
AB  == tylosin phosphate is a macrolide commonly administered to cattle in north america for the control of liver abscesses. this study investigated the effect of in-feed administration of tylosin phosphate to cattle at subtherapeutic levels and its subsequent withdrawal on macrolide resistance using enterococci as an indicator bacterium. fecal samples were collected from steers that received no antibiotics  and steers administered tylosin phosphate (11 ppm) in-feed for 197 days and withdrawn 28 days before slaughter. enterococcus species isolated from fecal samples were identified through sequencing the groes-el intergenic spacer region  and subject to antimicrobial susceptibility testing, identification of resistance determinants and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis profiling. tylosin increased (p < 0.05) the proportion of ery(r) and tyl(r) enterococci within the population. just prior to its removal, the proportion of ery(r) and tyl(r) resistant enterococci began decreasing and continued to decrease after tylosin was withdrawn from the diet until there was no difference (p > 0.05) between treatments on d 225. this suggests that antibiotic withdrawal prior to slaughter  contributes to a reduction in the proportion of macrolide resistant enterococci entering the food chain. among the 504 enterococci isolates characterized, enterococcus hirae was found to predominate (n = 431), followed by enterococcus villorum (n = 32), enterococcus faecium (n = 21), enterococcus durans (n = 7), enterococcus casseliflavus (n = 4), enterococcus mundtii (n = 4), enterococcus gallinarum (n = 3), enterococcus faecalis (n = 1), and enterococcus thailandicus  (n = 1). the diversity of enterococci was greater in steers at arrival than at exit from the feedlot. erythromycin resistant isolates harbored the erm(b) and/or msrc gene. similar pfge profiles of ery(r) e. hirae pre- and post-antibiotic treatment suggest that increased abundance of ery(r) enterococci after administration of tylosin phosphate reflects selection for strains that were already present within the gastrointestinal tract of cattle at arrival.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance profile of enterococcus species isolated from intestinal tracts of hospitalized patients in jimma, ethiopia.
AB  == background: multi-drug-resistant enterococci colonizing the intestinal tract of hospitalized patients are the major source of infection as well as nosocomial spread. despite worldwide increasing rate of multidrug resistant enterococci colonization and infection among hospitalized patients, there is scarcity of data from resource limited setting. the present study aimed at determining the antimicrobial resistance profile of enterococcus species from intestinal tracts of hospitalized patients in jimma, ethiopia. methods: the study was conducted among hospitalized patients at jimma university specialized hospital, from january to july 2013. fecal samples were collected and processed for bacterial isolation and susceptibility testing to antimicrobial agents. stool samples were  inoculated onto enterococcus selective media (bile esculin azide agar plate) with and without 6 microg/ml of vancomycin. the isolates were identified to genus and  species level by cultural characteristics, gram's stain, catalase test, growth in 6.5% nacl broth, growth at 45 degrees c, motility test and by using api 20 streptococcus system. sensitivity testing was done using kirby-bauer disk diffusion method. minimum inhibitory concentrations for vancomycin were determined using e-test strips. result: overall, enterococci were isolated from 114 (76%) of the study subjects. the isolates were enterococcus faecium (35.1%) followed by enterococcus faecalis (29.8%), enterococcus gallinarum (17.5%), enterococcus casseliflavus (8.8%) and enterococcus durans (8.8%). among 114 tested enterococci isolates, 41 (36%) were resistant to ampicillin, 62 (54.4%) to streptomycin and 39 (34.2%) to gentamycin. other alternative antibiotics to treat mixed nosocomial infection caused by enterococci also showed high rate of resistance in vitro: ciprofloxacin (50% of resistance), norfloxacin (49.1%), erythromycin (63.2%), tetracycline (64.9%), chloramphenicol (34.2%), and nitrofrantoin (32.4%). multiple drug resistance was observed among 89.5% of e. faecium and e. faecalis. vancomycin resistant enterococci were observed in 5% of  e. faecium isolates. conclusion: this study reveals high rate of fecal colonization by multidrug-resistant enterococci and prevalence of vancomycin resistance strains. thus periodic surveillance of antibacterial susceptibilities  is recommended to detect emerging resistance and to prevent the spread of antibacterial-resistant strains.

TI  == diversity of enterococcal species and characterization of high-level aminoglycoside resistant enterococci of samples of wastewater and surface water in tunisia.
AB  == one hundred-fourteen samples of wastewater (n=64) and surface-water (n=50) were inoculated in slanetz-bartley agar plates supplemented or not with gentamicin (sb-gen and sb plates, respectively) for enterococci recovery. enterococci were obtained from 75% of tested samples in sb media (72% in wastewater; 78% in surface-water), and 85 enterococcal isolates (one/positive-sample) were obtained. enterococcus faecium was the most prevalent species (63.5%), followed by enterococcus faecalis (20%), enterococcus hirae (9.4%), enterococcus casseliflavus (4.7%), and enterococcus gallinarum/enterococcus durans (2.4%). antibiotic resistance detected among these enterococci was as follows [percentage/detected gene (number isolates)]: kanamycin [29%/aph(3')-iiia (n=22)], streptomycin [8%/ant(6)-ia (n=4)], erythromycin [44%/erm(b) (n=34)], tetracycline [18%/tet(m) (n=6)/tet(m)-tet(l) (n=9)], chloramphenicol [2%/cat(a) (n=1)], ciprofloxacin [7%] and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole [94%]. high-level-gentamicin resistant (hlr-g) enterococci were recovered from 15 samples in sb-gen or sb plates [12/64 samples of wastewater (19%) and 3/50 samples of surface-water (6%)]; hlr-g isolates were identified as e. faecium (n=7), e. faecalis (n=6), and e. casseliflavus (n=2). these hlr-g enterococci carried the aac(6')-ie-aph(2'')-ia and erm(b) genes, in addition to aph(3')-iiia  (n=10), ant(6)-ia (n=9), tet(m) (n=13), tet(l) (n=8) and cat(a) genes (n=2). three hlr-g enterococci carried the esp virulence gene. sequence-types detected among hlr-g enterococci were as follows: e. faecalis (st480, st314, st202, st55,  and the new ones st531 and st532) and e. faecium (st327, st12, st296, and the new ones st985 and st986). thirty-two different pfge patterns were detected among 36  high-level-aminoglycoside-resistant enterococci recovered in water samples. diverse genetic lineages of hlr-g enterococci were detected in wastewater and surface-water in tunisia. water can represent an important source for the dissemination of these antibiotic resistant microorganisms to other environments.

TI  == occurrence and antimicrobial resistance of enterococci isolated from organic and  conventional retail chicken.
AB  == antibiotic-resistant bacteria existing in agricultural environments may be transferred to humans through food consumption or more multifaceted environmental paths of exposure. notably, enterococcal infections are becoming more challenging to treat as their resistance to antibiotics intensifies. in this study, the prevalence and antibiotic resistance profiles of enterococci in organic and conventional chicken from retail stores were analyzed. of the total 343 retail chicken samples evaluated, 282 (82.2%) were contaminated with enterococcus spp. the prevalence was higher in organic chicken (62.5%) than conventional chicken (37.5%). enterococcus isolates were submitted to susceptibility tests against 12  antimicrobial agents. among the isolates tested, streptomycin had the highest frequencies of resistance (69.1 and 100%) followed by erythromycin (38.5 and 80.0%), penicillin (14.1 and 88.5%), and kanamycin (11.3 and 76.9%) for organic and conventional isolates, respectively. chloramphenicol had the lowest frequency (0.0 and 6.6%, respectively). the predominant species in raw chicken was e. faecium (27.3%), followed by e. gallinarum (6.0%), e. casseliflavus (2.1%), and e. durans (1.4%). these species were also found to be resistant to three or more  antibiotics. the data indicated that antibiotic-resistant enterococci isolates were found in chicken whether it was organic or conventional. however, enterococci isolates that were resistant to antibiotics were less common in organic chicken (31.0%) when compared with those isolated from conventional chicken (43.6%). the results of this study suggest that raw retail organic and conventional chickens could be a source of antibiotic-resistant enterococci.

TI  == detection of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis st6-vanb2 and e. faecium  st915-vana in faecal samples of wild rattus rattus in spain.
AB  == the detection of vancomycin-resistant-enterococci (vre) among wild animals represents a worrisome public health concern. the objectives of the study were to determine the possible presence of vre in faecal samples of wild small mammals in spain, to characterize the vancomycin resistance mechanisms and genetic lineages  of recovered isolates and to know the diversity of enterococcal species in these  animals. a total of 155 faecal samples from small mammals were inoculated in slanetz-bartley agar supplemented or not with vancomycin (van-sb/sb plates). the  antimicrobial susceptibility profile to 12 antimicrobials and the presence of 20  antimicrobial resistance genes was analyzed. the structure of tn1546 and the presence of gele, cyla, asa, esp and hyl genes was studied. multilocus-sequence-typing (mlst) technique was also performed. vre isolates were recovered in van-sb plates in 11 samples. two samples contained vanb2-positive e. faecalis isolates of lineage st6, which showed a multiresistance phenotype and harboured the virulence genes gele and asa. one sample contained a vancomycin-resistant e. faecium isolate of the new lineage st915, with the vana gene included into tn1546 (truncated with is1542 and is1216 elements). the vanb2  and vana isolates were obtained from rattus rattus. the remaining eight vre-positive samples contained species with intrinsic vancomycin-resistance mechanisms: e. casseliflavus (n=5) and e. gallinarum (n=3). one hundred and forty-seven vancomycin-susceptible-enterococcal isolates were obtained in sb plates, and e. faecalis and e. faecium were the most frequent detected species. this is the first report of vanb2-containing enterococci in wild animals.

TI  == modified 16s-23s rrna intergenic region restriction endonuclease analysis for species identification of enterococcus strains isolated from pigs, compared with  identification using classical methods and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry.
AB  == fast and reliable identification of bacteria to at least the species level is currently the basis for correct diagnosis and appropriate treatment of infections. this is particularly important in the case of bacteria of the genus enterococcus, whose resistance profile is often correlated with their species (e.g. resistance to vancomycin). in this study, we evaluated restriction endonuclease analysis of the 16s-23s rrna gene intergenic transcribed spacer (its) region for species identification of enterococcus. the utility of the method was compared with that of phenotypic methods [biochemical profile evaluation and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms)]. identification was based on 21 enterococcus reference strains, of the species e. faecalis, e. faecium, e. hirae, e. durans, e. casseliflavus, e. gallinarum, e. avium, e. cecorum and e. columbae, and 47 enterococcus field strains isolated from pigs. restriction endonuclease analysis  of the its-pcr product using hinfi, rsai and mboi, in the order specified, enabled species differentiation of the enterococcus reference and field strains,  and in the case of the latter, the results of species identification were identical (47/47) to those obtained by maldi-tof ms. moreover, as a result of digestion with mboi, a unique restriction profile was also obtained for the strains (3/3) identified by maldi-tof ms as e. thailandicus. in our opinion, restriction endonuclease analysis of the 16s-23s rrna gene its region of enterococcus may be a simple and relatively fast (less than 4 h) alternative method for identifying the species occurring most frequently in humans and animals.

TI  == identification of enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis as vanc-type vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) from sewage and river water in the provincial city of miyazaki, japan.
AB  == as a first step for assessing the risk to human health posed by vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) in the aquatic environment, we screened sewage and urban river water samples from miyazaki, japan for vre. because vancomycin-resistant organisms are not as prevalent in sewage and river water as  vancomycin-susceptible organisms, the samples were screened by minimum inhibitory concentration test using the vancomycin-supplemented membrane-enterococcus indoxyl-beta-d-glucoside (mei) agar. the isolates, presumed to be enterococci, were identified using 16s rrna sequencing analysis. the percentages of vre isolates screened using 4 mug ml(-1) vancomycin-supplemented mei agar from sewage and urban river water samples were 12% and 24%, respectively. the vancomycin-resistant genes vanc1 and vanc2/3 were detected in the isolates from both samples by pcr analysis. all enterococci isolates containing vanc1, which is a specific gene for vanc-type of vre, were identified as enterococcus casseliflavus/gallinarum. further, 92% enterococci isolates containing vanc2/3 were identified as e. casseliflavus/gallinarum, the remaining isolates containing vanc2/3 were e. faecium (4%) and e. faecalis (4%). thereafter, the distribution of e. faecium and e. faecalis, which are the major types of enterococci in humans containing vanc2/3, was observed in the water samples collected.

TI  == identification and characterization of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus species  frequently isolated from laboratory mice.
AB  == to determine the prevalence of drug resistant bacteria colonizing laboratory mice, we isolated and characterized vancomycin-resistant enterococcus species (vre) from commercially available mice. a total of 24 vre isolates were obtained  from 19 of 21 mouse strains supplied by 4 commercial breeding companies. of these, 19 isolates of e. gallinarum and 5 isolates of e. casseliflavus possessing the vanc1 and vanc2/3 genes intrinsically, exhibited intermediate resistance to vancomycin respectively. in addition, these isolates also exhibited diverse resistant patterns to erythromycin, tetracycline, and ciprofloxacin, whereas the  use of antibiotics had not been undertaken in mouse strains tested in this study. although 6 virulence-associated genes (ace, asa, cyla, efaa, esp, and gele) and secretion of gelatinase and hemolysin were not detected in all isolates, 23 of 24 isolates including the isolates of e. casselifalvus secreted atp into culture supernatants. since secretion of atp by bacteria resident in the intestinal tract modulates the local immune responses, the prevalence of atp-secreting vre in mice therefore needs to be considered in animal experiments that alter the gut microflora by use of antibiotics.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of enterococcal species isolated from antibiotic-treated dogs and cats.
AB  == in this study, we examined the antimicrobial susceptibility of the enterococci isolated from dogs and cats in japan during 2011-2012. fecal samples were collected from 84 dogs and 16 cats that underwent antibiotic treatment. enterococci were detected in 70 of 84 dogs (83.3%) and 7 of 16 cats (43.8%). the  most prevalent enterococcus species was enterococcus faecalis (64.9%); enterococcus faecium and enterococcus durans were also isolated from 14 of 77 (18.2%) and 5 of 77 (6.5%) of these animals, respectively. the most active resistance was observed for erythromycin (44.2%) and oxytetracycline (44.2%), and there was considerable resistance to lincomycin (41.6%), gentamicin (31.2%) and kanamycin (31.2%). compared with the results of a similar study conducted in 2006 and 2007, enterococci susceptibility to enrofloxacin and ampicillin had significantly increased. enterococcus gallinarum harboring vanc1 and enterococcus casseliflavus harboring vanc2/3 were isolated from 4 of 77 enterococcal isolates. however, no enterococcal isolates were resistant to vancomycin. multidrug resistance was found for as few as two and as many as nine antimicrobials regardless of the class. these results demonstrate that dogs and cats treated with antibiotics are commonly colonized with antimicrobial-resistant enterococci.

TI  == first report of multiresistance gene cfr in enterococcus species casseliflavus and gallinarum of swine origin.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the presence and genetic environment of  the multiresistance gene cfr in enterococcus species of swine origin. twenty-five cfr-carrying enterococcus isolates were collected from swine in beijing, guangzhou, and shandong, china. the isolates consist of 24 enterococcus casseliflavus and one enterococcus gallinarum isolate, and exhibited six smai pfge patterns. the cfr gene was located on plasmids in all isolates except e. casseliflavus en83, in which cfr was located on the chromosomal dna. the cfr gene environments in most of these isolates contain dna sequences similar to pef-01, which was first found in enterococcus. however, inverse pcr analysis suggested that the cfr-carrying circular forms might be different from pef-01. the circular forms in eg51 and its transconjugant, and en23, en10, and en94 are similar to the circular form in pef-01, except for the truncated is1216, which is replaced by a  transposase of the is256 family in en24. the cfr circular form could not be detected in either en77 or en83, and the same cfr-carrying segments of approximately 10 kb had only 3500bp of sequence similar to pef-01. this is the first report of cfr gene in e. casseliflavus and e. gallinarum. the potential dissemination of the multidrug resistance gene amongst different bacterial species, especially in enterococci of human and animal origins, is concerning and should be closely monitored.

TI  == enterococcal disease, epidemiology, and implications for treatment
AB  == during the past few decades, enterococci have emerged as important healthcare-associated pathogens (arias & murray, 2012; austin, bonten, weinstein, slaughter, & anderson, 1999; boyce, et al., 1994; benenson, et al., 2009; goossens, 1998; handwerger, et al., 1993). the continuing progress of modern medical care toward more intensive and invasive medical therapies for human disease has undoubtedly contributed to the increased prevalence of these remarkable opportunistic pathogens. this trend has also been attributed to the increasing antibiotic resistance among clinical isolates of enterococci. the rapid spread of enterococci with resistance to vancomycin (vre) has been of particular concern. many healthcare-associated strains that are resistant to vancomycin also show resistance to penicillin, as well as high-level resistance (hlr) to aminoglycosides. finally, as has historically been the case with enterococci, resistance is emerging to newer agents used to treat vre infections, such as linezolid, quinupristin/dalfopristin, and daptomycin (chow, donahedian, & zervos, 1997; herrero, issa, & patel, 2002; sabol, patterson, lewis ii, aaron, cadena, & jorgensen, 2005). over the past two decades, enterococcus faecium has emerged as a leading cause of multidrug-resistant enterococcal infection in the united states (hidron, et al., 2008). e. faecium is intrinsically more antibiotic-resistant than e. faecalis, with more than half of its pathogenic isolates expressing resistance to vancomycin, ampicillin, and high-levels of aminoglycosides. treating infections caused by this species can be difficult, and the magnitude of the problem is vast. approximately 40% of medical intensive care units in a recent national healthcare safety network report found that the majority of device-associated infections (namely, infections due to central lines, urinary drainage catheters, and ventilators) were due to vancomycin- and ampicillin-resistant e. faecium (80% and 90.4%, respectively) (hidron, et al., 2008). although they were often resistant to high-level aminoglycosides and some  macrolides, healthcare-associated infections in these units due to e. faecalis remained largely susceptible to vancomycin and ampicillin (93.1% and 96.2%, respectively) for reasons that are not entirely known. other enterococcal species are rarer causes of human infection, including e. durans, e. avium, e. casseliflavus, e. hirae, e. gallinarum, e. raffinosus, and e. muntdii (gordon, et al., 1992). in the following sections, the common human infections caused by enterococci are briefly described. the epidemiology of antibiotic-resistant enterococci in healthcare settings is summarized, including the role of colonization pressure and host factors on the emergence of vre in clinical settings. finally, the current challenges facing clinicians who treat antibiotic-resistant enterococcal infections are reviewed.

TI  == drug-resistant and hospital-associated enterococcus faecium from wastewater, riverine estuary and anthropogenically impacted marine catchment basin.
AB  == background: enterococci, ubiquitous colonizers of humans and other animals, play  an increasingly important role in health-care associated infections (hais). it is believed that the recent evolution of two clinically relevant species, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium occurred in a big part in a hospital environment, leading to formation of high-risk enterococcal clonal complexes (hireccs), which combine multidrug resistance with increased pathogenicity and epidemicity. the aim of this study was to establish the species composition in wastewater, its marine recipient as well as a river estuary and to investigate the antimicrobial susceptibility of collected isolates. molecular methods were additionally applied to test the presence of hirrecc-related e. faecium. results: two wastewater treatment plants (wwtps), their marine outfalls  and vistula river that influence significantly the quality of waters in gulf of gdansk were sampled to investigate the presence of enterococcus spp. four-hundred-twenty-eight isolates were obtained, including e. faecium (244 isolates, 57.0%), e. hirae (113 isolates, 26.4%) and e. faecalis (63 isolates, 14.7%); other species (e. gallinarum/casseliflavus, e. durans and e. avium) accounted for 1.9%. antimicrobial susceptibility testing revealed the presence of isolates resistant to erythromycin, tetracycline, amipicillin, fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides (high-level resistance), especially among e. faecium, where such isolates were usually characterized by multilocus sequence types associated  with nosocomial lineages 17, 18 and 78 of this species representing hirecc, formerly called cc17. these isolates not only carried several resistance determinants but were also enriched in genes encoding pathogenicity factors (esp, pili) and genes associated with mobile genetic elements (mge), a feature also typical for nosocomial hirecc. conclusions: our data show that wwtps constitute an important source of enterococcal strains carrying antimicrobial resistance determinants, often associated with the presence of mge, for the recipient water  environment, thus increasing a pool of such genes for other organisms. the presence of hireccs in wastewaters and marine/river environment may indicate that adaptations gained in hospitals may be also beneficial for survival of such clones in other settings. there is an obvious need to monitor the release and spread of such strains in order to elucidate better ways to curb their dissemination.

TI  == significance and survival of enterococci during the house fly development.
AB  == house flies are among the most important nonbiting insect pests of medical and veterinary importance. larvae develop in decaying organic substrates and their survival strictly depends on an active microbial community. house flies have been implicated in the ecology and transmission of enterococci, including multi-antibiotic-resistant and virulent strains of enterococcus faecalis. in this study, eight american type culture collection type strains of enterococci including enterococcus avium, enterococcus casseliflavus, enterococcus durans, enterococcus hirae, enterococcus mundtii, enterococcus gallinarum, enterococcusfaecalis, and enterococcusfaecium were evaluated for their significance in the development of house flies from eggs to adults in bacterial feeding assays. furthermore, the bacterial colonization of the gut of teneral flies as well as the importance of several virulence traits of e. faecalis in larval mortality was assessed. overall survival of house flies (egg to adult) was significantly higher when grown with typically nonpathogenic enterococcal species such as e. hirae (76.0% survival), e. durans (64.0%), and e. avium (64.0%) compared with that with clinically important species e. faecalis (24.0%) and e. faecium (36.0%). however, no significant differences in survival of house fly larvae were detected when grown with e. faecalis strains carrying various virulence traits, including isogenic mutants of the human clinical isolate e. faecalis v583 with in-frame deletions of gelatinase, serine protease, and capsular polysaccharide serotype c. enterococci were commonly detected in fly puparia (range: 75-100%; concentration: 103-105 cfu/puparium);however, the prevalence of enterococci in teneral flies varied greatly: from 25.0 (e. casseliflavus) to 89.5% (e. hirae). in conclusion, depending on the species, enterococci variably support house fly larval development and colonize the gut of teneral adults. the human pathogenic species, e. faecalis and e. faecium, poorly  support larval development and are likely acquired in nature by adult flies during feeding. house fly larvae do not appear to be a suitable model organism for assessment of enterococcal virulence traits.

TI  == vana-containing e. faecium isolates of clonal complex cc17 in clinical and environmental samples in a tunisian hospital.
AB  == twenty-eight vancomycin (va)-resistant enterococci isolated from different patients (n = 16) and also from the environment (n = 12) were recovered in a tunisian military hospital during 2012-2013. the mechanisms of resistance to va and to other antibiotics as well as the presence of esp and hyl virulence genes were determined in these isolates by pcr, being their clonal relationship analyzed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge). va resistance mechanisms detected were as follows (species-patient/environment): vana (enterococcus faecium, 13/5), vanc1 (enterococcus gallinarum, 3/0), and vanc2 (enterococcus casseliflavus, 0/7). most of the va-resistant enterococci presented a multiresistance phenotype and harbored different resistance genes (erm(b), tet(m), tet(l), ant(6)-ia, aac(6')-aph(2"), aph(3')-iiia, and cata). the pfge revealed the presence of 3 clones (a, b, c) and 1 closely related pattern (a1) among the 13 vana-containing e. faecium isolates of patients showing 11 of them the a-a1 patterns. the clone a was also detected in all 5 environmental vana-containing e. faecium isolates. strains did not contain esp or hyl virulence genes. multilocus sequence typing was performed in 4 e. faecium isolates representative of the 4 detected pulsotypes (a, a1, b, and c), and 2 different sequence types were identified (st18 and st80), both of them included in clonal complex cc17. these strains contained the is16 element and showed ampicillin and  ciprofloxacin resistance. va resistance could be an emerging problem in tunisia,  and this is one of the first cases described so far in this country.

TI  == genetic characterization of antibiotic resistance and virulence factors in enterococcus spp. from japanese retail ready-to-eat raw fish.
AB  == little information is available on the diversity and distribution of resistance and virulence factors in enterococci isolated from retail fish. in this study, 200 samples of retail ready-to-eat raw fish (sashimi) collected from the japanese prefecture of hiroshima were analyzed for incidence of enterococcus spp. we recovered 96 enterococcal isolates from 90 (45%, 90/200) samples. fifty-six strains were identified at the species level: e. faecalis (n = 31), e. faecium (n = 7), e. casseliflavus (n = 7), e. gallinarum (n = 3), e. phoeniculicola (n = 4), e. raffinosus (n = 2), e. saccharolyticus (n = 1), and e. gilvus (n = 1). twenty-five (26%, 25/96) strains carried antibiotic resistance genes. these included the tet(m), tet(l), tet(k), erm(b), msr(a/b), aph(3'), and blaz genes, which were detected in 12.5%, 9.3%, 2%, 14.5%, 1%, 1%, and 2% of isolates, respectively. the virulence genes gele and asa1 were detected in 31 and 24 e. faecalis strains, respectively. both genes were detected in one e. faecium strain. in conclusion, this is the first study to underscore the importance of sashimi as not only a reservoir of enterococcus spp. carrying resistance and virulence genes, but also a reservoir for unusual enterococcus spp.

TI  == presence of the vancomycin resistance gene cluster vanc1, vanxyc, and vant in enterococcus casseliflavus.
AB  == the three chromosomally located clustered genes vanc1, vanxyc, and vant confer intrinsic resistance to vancomycin and are used for species identification of enterococcus gallinarum. in this study, 28 strains belonging to the e. gallinarum/casseliflavus group isolated from cloacal swabs from laying hens were  screened for the presence of vanc1. as confirmed by species-specific multiplex pcr, 11 vanc1-positive strains were identified as e. gallinarum. surprisingly, one yellow pigmented strain, verified as e. casseliflavus by species-specific multiplex pcr, was also vanc1 positive; vanxyc and vant were additionally detectable in this strain. to our knowledge, this is the first report of vanc1, vanxyc, and vant in e. casseliflavus. the minimum inhibitory concentration of vancomycin was 4 mg/l. real-time reverse transcription-pcr revealed that none of  the clustered genes was expressed in this strain. even if the genes seem not to be active, there is a certain risk that they will be transferred to other bacteria where they might be functionally expressed. therefore, it may be advisable to expand the search for vanc1, vanxyc, and vant from e. gallinarum to  other (enterococcal) species. this study confirms that enterococci live up to their name as being reservoir bacteria and should therefore always be closely monitored.

AB  == vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) consist mainly of enterococcus faecalis and e faecium, the latter mostly hospital-acquired. in addition, e gallinarum and e casseliflavus are intrinsically vancomycin-resistant and are community-acquired. vre have become common in many hospitals throughout the world and, once established, are very difficult to eradicate. vre are difficult to treat; therefore, infection control measures in hospitals are of prime importance in preventing the establishment of these pathogens. most severe vre infections will need combination therapy because many of the effective antimicrobial agents, when used alone, have only a bacteriostatic effect.

TI  == microbiological quality of ready-to-eat salads: an underestimated vehicle of bacteria and clinically relevant antibiotic resistance genes.
AB  == the increase demand for fresh vegetables is causing an expansion of the market for minimally processed vegetables along with new recognized food safety problems. to gain further insight on this topic we analyzed the microbiological quality of portuguese ready-to-eat salads (rts) and their role in the spread of bacteria carrying acquired antibiotic resistance genes, food products scarcely considered in surveillance studies. a total of 50 rts (7 brands; split or mixed leaves, carrot, corn) were collected in 5 national supermarket chains in porto region (2010). they were tested for aerobic mesophilic counts, coliforms and escherichia coli counts as well as for the presence of salmonella and listeria monocytogenes. samples were also plated in different selective media with/without antibiotics before and after enrichment. the e. coli, other coliforms and enterococcus recovered were characterized for antibiotic resistance profiles and  clonality with phenotypic and genetic approaches. a high number of rts presented  poor microbiological quality (86%--aerobic mesophilic counts, 74%--coliforms, 4%--e. coli), despite the absence of screened pathogens. in addition, a high diversity of bacteria (species and clones) and antibiotic resistance backgrounds  (phenotypes and genotypes) were observed, mostly with enrichment and antibiotic selective media. e. coli was detected in 13 samples (n=78; all types and 4 brands; phylogenetic groups a, b1 and d; none stec) with resistance to tetracycline [72%; tet(a) and/or tet(b)], streptomycin (58%; aada and/or stra-strb), sulfamethoxazole (50%; sul1 and/or sul2), trimethoprim (50%; dfra1 or dfra12), ampicillin (49%; blatem), nalidixic acid (36%), ciprofloxacin (5%) or chloramphenicol (3%; cata). e. coli clones, including the widespread group d/st69, were detected in different samples from the same brand or different brands pointing out to a potential cross-contamination. other clinically relevant resistance genes were detected in 2 raoultella terrigena carrying a bla(shv-2) and 1 citrobacter freundii isolate with a qnrb9 gene. among enterococcus (n=108;  35 samples; enterococcus casseliflavus--40, enterococcus faecalis--20, enterococcus faecium--18, enterococcus hirae--9, enterococcus gallinarum--5, and  enterococcus spp.--16) resistance was detected for tetracyclines [6%; tet(m) and/or tet(l)], erythromycin [3%; erm(b)], nitrofurantoin (1%) or ciprofloxacin (1%). the present study places ready-to-eat salads within the spectrum of ecological niches that may be vehicles for antibiotic resistance bacteria/genes with clinical interest (e.g. e. coli-d-st69; bla(shv-2)) and these findings are worthy of attention as their spread to humans by ingestion cannot be dismissed.

TI  == diversity, distribution and antibiotic resistance of enterococcus spp. recovered  from tomatoes, leaves, water and soil on u.s. mid-atlantic farms.
AB  == antibiotic-resistant enterococci are important opportunistic pathogens and have been recovered from retail tomatoes. however, it is unclear where and how tomatoes are contaminated along the farm-to-fork continuum. specifically, the degree of pre-harvest contamination with enterococci is unknown. we evaluated the prevalence, diversity and antimicrobial susceptibilities of enterococci collected from tomato farms in the mid-atlantic united states. tomatoes, leaves, groundwater, pond water, irrigation ditch water, and soil were sampled and tested for enterococci using standard methods. antimicrobial susceptibility testing was  performed using the sensititre microbroth dilution system. enterococcus faecalis  isolates were characterized using amplified fragment length polymorphism to assess dispersal potential. enterococci (n = 307) occurred in all habitats and colonization of tomatoes was common. seven species were identified: enterococcus  casseliflavus, e. faecalis, enterococcus gallinarum, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus avis, enterococcus hirae and enterococcus raffinosus. e. casseliflavus predominated in soil and on tomatoes and leaves, and e. faecalis predominated in pond water. on plants, distance from the ground influenced presence of enterococci. e. faecalis from samples within a farm were more closely related than those from samples between farms. resistance to rifampicin, quinupristin/dalfopristin, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin was prevalent. consumption of raw tomatoes as a potential exposure risk for antibiotic-resistant enterococcus spp. deserves further attention.

TI  == detection and genotyping of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus spp. by multiplex polymerase chain reaction in korean aquatic environmental samples.
AB  == the distribution characteristics of enterococcus spp., which are indicators of fecal pollution, were investigated at 33 sites within the 3 major water systems of korea. enterococci were detected at concentrations ranging from 1 to 37 cfu/100ml in 41 of 132 samples (31.1%) from the 3 major water systems. the overall average detected concentration was 1.2 cfu/100ml, while the average concentration for all detection sites was 5.3 cfu/100ml. after optimized multiplex polymerase chain reaction (pcr) was performed with newly developed vana, vanb, vanc-1, and vanc-2/3 primers, concentrations of vancomycin-resistant  enterococcus spp. (vre) ranging from 1 to 23 cfu/100ml were detected in 17 of 132 samples (12.9%). of 216 individual enterococcal colonies, 64 (29.6%) displayed the vanc genotype. the results of a susceptibility test to vancomycin showed that the range of the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic), an indicator of bacterial resistance, was 4 to 24mug/ml, with the average mic at 9.2+/-4.5mug/ml. of the bacterial isolates, 1 colony with the vanc-1 genotype was identified as e. gallinarum by 16s rdna sequencing, whereas the other 63 colonies had the vanc-2/3 genotype and were identified as e. casseliflavus. although these results imply that the major head bays of korea are not contaminated with the highly vancomycin-resistant vana- or vanb-type vres, the misuse of antibiotics should be prohibited to minimize the presence of vres and to maintain a safe water supply for protecting the health of the general population. based on the study results,  we also recommend the implementation of a continuous, broad-spectrum inspection program for enterococcus spp. and vre contamination in the major head bays. furthermore, the multiplex pcr method described in this study can be used effectively for this purpose.

TI  == environmental contamination by dog&#8217;s faeces: a public health problem?
AB  == the risk to public health from the large number of dog stools present on streets  of urban areas is cause for concern. dog faeces may be a serious hazard because they may contain microorganisms that are both pathogenic to humans and resistant  to several classes of antibiotics. the aim of this study was to evaluate the potential for zoonotic infections and for the presence of antibiotic resistant bacteria in canine faeces which contaminates the urban environment. a total of 418 canine faecal samples were collected from streets in seven areas of bari, southern italy. we have isolated multi-drug resistant enterococci and meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus from these dog faecal samples. the presence of the resistant bacteria in an urban environment may represent a public health hazard which requires control measures by competent authorities. no salmonella, yersinia or campylobacter species were isolated. giardia cysts were detected in 1.9% of the samples. the predominant enterococcus species were e. faecium (61.6%), e. gallinarum (23.3%) and e. casseliflavus (5.5%). other species, including e. faecalis were also isolated. these strains were resistant to clindamycin (86.3%), tetracycline (65.7%), erythromycin (60.27%) and ampicillin (47.9%). high-level aminoglycoside resistance (hlar) was found in 65.7% of enterococci. resistance to three or more antibiotics and six or more antibiotics were observed in 67.12% and 38.4% of enterococcus spp., respectively. resistance to vancomycin and teicoplanin was not detected in any of the enterococcus spp. isolated. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus was isolated in 0.7% of the faecal samples. canine faeces left on the streets may represent a risk factor for transmission of microorganisms and a reservoir of multidrug- resistant bacteria thus contributing to the spread of resistance genes into an urban area.

TI  == screening fecal enterococci from greek healthy infants for susceptibility to antimicrobial agents.
AB  == enterococci are among the first lactic acid bacteria to colonize the neonatal gastrointestinal tract, but they are also characterized as significant nosocomial pathogens. the aim of this study was to investigate the incidence of antibiotic resistance in enterococci isolated from neonates' gut microbiota as well as the presence of genetic determinants encoding for certain antibiotic resistance traits. a total of 263 fecal samples derived from 97 infants were collected on day 4, 30, and 90 after delivery. enterococcus faecalis was the most frequently identified species (54.6%) followed by e. faecium, while e. casseliflavus/e. flavescens and e. gallinarum were also traced. the isolates were examined for their resistance to 12 antibiotics. rifampicin resistance was the highest observed (53.2%), followed by resistance to tetracycline (42.0%), erythromycin (35.7%), and vancomycin (11.2%). multiresistant strains were highly prevalent. only intrinsic vancomycin resistance (vanc1 and vanc2/c3) was traced. the ermb gene was detected in 49 out of 96 erythromycin-resistant isolates, while tet genes were detected in 51 out of 113 tetracycline-resistant strains, with tet(l)  being the most frequently observed. in conclusion, antibiotic-resistant enterococci are already established in the fecal microbiota of healthy neonates,  from the first days of an infant's life.

TI  == antibiotic-resistant enterococci in seawater and sediments from a coastal fish farm.
AB  == the aim of this study was to detect and characterize antibiotic-resistant enterococci in seawater and sediment from a mediterranean aquaculture site where  no antibiotics are used. colonies (650) grown on slanetz-bartley (sb) agar were amplified on antibiotic-supplemented sb, and erythromycin (ery), tetracycline (tet), and ampicillin (amp) mics were determined. of 75 resistant isolates (17 to tet, 5 to ery, and 45 to amp), 5 enterococcus faecalis, 25 e. faecium, 5 e. casseliflavus, 1 e. gallinarum, 1 e. durans, and 23 enterococcus spp. were identified by genus- and species-specific polymerase chain reaction (pcr). tet(m), tet(o), tet(l), tet(k), erm(b), erm(a), erm(c), mef, msr, blaz, and int(tn916) were sought by pcr, including an improved multiplex pcr assay targeting tet(m), tet(l), and erm(b). tet(m) was the most frequent tet resistance gene; msr(c) was the sole ery resistance gene detected. blaz was found in 29/45 amp-resistant isolates; however, no beta-lactamase production was detected. antibiotic-resistant enterococci were recovered 2 km off the coast despite the absence of selective pressure exerted by antibiotic use. the occurrence of resistant strains in the absence of the tested genes may indicate the presence of less common resistance determinants. this first evidence of resistant enterococci at a mediterranean aquaculture site suggests the existence of a marine reservoir  of antibiotic resistances potentially transmissible to virulent strains that could be affected by mariculture in an antibiotic-independent manner.

TI  == risk factors for vancomycin-resistant enterococci colonisation in critically ill  patients.
AB  == vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) are important hospital pathogens and have  become increasingly common in patients admitted to the intensive care unit (icu). to determine the incidence and the risk factors associated with vre colonisation  among icu patients, active surveillance cultures for vre faecal carriages were carried out in patients admitted to the icu of the university hospital of uberlandia, minas gerais, brazil. risk factors were assessed using a case-control study. seventy-seven patients (23.1%) were found to be colonised with vanc vre and only one patient (0.3%) was colonised with vana vre. independent risk factors for vre colonisation included nephropathy [odds ratio (or) = 13.6, p < 0.001], prior antibiotic use (or = 5.5, p < 0.03) and carbapenem use (or = 17.3, p < 0.001). our results showed a higher frequency (23.1%) of enterococcus gallinarum  and enterococcus casseliflavus, species that are intrinsically resistant to low levels of vancomycin (vanc), without an associated infection, associated with prior antibiotic use, carbapenem use and nephropathy as comorbidity. this study is the first to demonstrate the risk factors associated with vanc vre colonisation in icu hospitalised patients. although vana and vanb enterococci are of great importance, the epidemiology of vanc vre needs to be better understood.  even though the clinical relevance of vanc vre is uncertain, these species are opportunistic pathogens and vanc vre-colonised patients are a potential epidemiologic reservoir of resistance genes.

TI  == bacteriophage lysis of enterococcus host strains: a tool for microbial source tracking?
AB  == this paper describes the isolation of enterococcus host strains, for potential use as simple bacteriophage (phage)-based microbial source tracking (mst) tools.  presumptive enterococcus host strains were isolated from cattle feces, raw municipal wastewater, agricultural runoff, and waters impacted by farms or wastewater treatment works (wwtw) in southern england, united kingdom (uk). all enterococcal host strains (n = 390) were first screened for their ability to detect phage in samples of raw municipal wastewater and fecal material from cattle, pigs, and sheep. host strains that detected phage (n = 147) were ranked according to both their specificity to a particular fecal source and also the number of phages (expressed as plaque-forming units, pfu) that they detected per  milliliter of sample. host strains that demonstrated host specificity and which detected phages at levels greater than 100 pfu/ml (n = 29) were further tested using additional fecal samples of human and nonhuman origin. the specificity and  sensitivity of the enterococcal host strains were found to vary, ranging from 44  to 100% and from 17 to 83%, respectively. most notably, seven strains exhibited 100% specificity to either cattle, human, or pig samples. isolates exhibiting specificity to cattle were identified as belonging to the species enterococcus casseliflavus , enterococcus mundtii , or enterococcus gallinarum , while human and pig isolates were members of either enterococcus faecium or enterococcus faecalis . the high specificity of phages infecting enterococcus hosts and the simplicity and relatively low cost of the approach collectively indicate a strong potential for using this method as a tool in mst.

TI  == antibiotic resistance in faecal microbiota of greek healthy infants.
AB  == increasing use of antibiotics for the treatment of infectious diseases and also for non-therapeutic reasons (agriculture, animal husbandry and aquaculture) has led to the increasing incidence of antibiotic resistance and the ineffectiveness  of antimicrobial treatment. commensal intestinal bacteria are very often exposed  to the selective pressure of antimicrobial agents and may constitute a reservoir  of antibiotic resistance determinants that can be transferred to pathogens. the present study aimed to investigate the antibiotic susceptibility profile and the  presence of selected resistance genes in cocci isolated from the faecal microbiota of 35 healthy, full-term infants at 4, 30 and 90 days after delivery.  a total of 148 gram-positive, catalase-negative cocci were isolated and tested for susceptibility to 12 different antibiotics by disk-diffusion technique. multiplex pcr analysis was performed for the identification of enterococcus spp.  isolates and the simultaneous detection of vancomycin-resistance genes. pcr-based methodology was used also for identification of tetracycline and erythromycin resistance determinants. identification results indicated e. faecalis as the predominant species (81 strains), followed by e. faecium, e. casseliflavus/e. flavescens and e. gallinarum. high prevalence of resistance to tetracycline (39.9%), erythromycin (35.1%), vancomycin (19.6%) and to nucleic acid synthesis inhibitors was detected. pcr data revealed 24 out of 52 erythromycin-resistant isolates carrying the ermb gene and 32 out of 59 tetracycline-resistant strains carrying tet genes, with tet(l) determinant being the most frequently detected. only intrinsic vancomycin resistance (vanc1 and vanc2/c3) was reported among tested isolates. in conclusion, erythromycin and tetracycline acquired resistant  traits are widespread among faecal cocci isolates from greek, healthy infants under no apparent antimicrobial selective pressure.

AB  == the trimethoprim resistance gene dfrk has been recently described in staphylococcus aureus, but so far has not been found in other bacteria. a total of 166 enterococci of different species (e. faecium, e. faecalis, e. hirae, e. durans, e. gallinarum, and e. casseliflavus) and origins (food, clinical diseases in humans, healthy humans or animals, and sewage) were studied for their susceptibility to trimethoprim as determined by agar dilution (european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing) and the presence of (a) the dfrk gene and its genetic environment and (b) other dfr genes. the dfrk gene was detected in 49% of the enterococci (64% and 42% of isolates with minimum inhibitory concentrations of >/=2 mg/l or </=1 mg/l, respectively). the tet(l)-dfrk linkage  was detected in 21% of dfrk-positive enterococci. the chromosomal location of the dfrk gene was identified in one e. faecium isolate in which the dfrk was not linked to tet(l) gene but was part of a tn559 element, which was integrated in the chromosomal radc gene. this tn559 element was also found in 14 additional isolates. all combinations of dfr genes were detected among the isolates tested (dfrk, dfrg, dfrf, dfrk+dfrg, dfrk+dfrf, dfrf+dfrg, and dfrf+dfrg+dfrk). the gene dfrk gene was found together with other dfr genes in 58% of the tested enterococci. this study suggested an exchange of the trimethoprim resistance gene dfrk between enterococci and staphylococci, as previously observed for the trimethoprim resistance gene dfrg.

TI  == prevalence of vanc vancomycin-resistant enterococci in the teaching hospitals of  the university of debrecen, hungary.
AB  == vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) are common nosocomial pathogens; however,  until now they have been rarely encountered in hungary. in the present study, we  investigated the prevalence of vre in the teaching hospitals of the university of debrecen. of 7,271 enterococcus-containing clinical samples collected between 2004 and 2009, we identified 16 vre. species-specific polymerase chain reaction was used to detect enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus casseliflavus, and enterococcus gallinarum. multiplex polymerase chain reaction was performed to identify the vancomycin resistance genes: vana, vanb, vanc1/c2,  vand, vane, and vang. restriction digestion with sali and hindiii was introduced  to differentiate the vanc1 and vanc2 genes from each other. genetic relationships between the strains were investigated by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. overall, we identified the vanc1 resistance gene in 14 e. gallinarum and the vanc2 resistance gene in two e. casseliflavus strains. except for two samples, the isolates had different pulsed-field gel electrophoresis types, suggesting sporadic emergence of the resistant bacteria. in addition, antibiotic resistance  profile was determined by e-test. three e. gallinarum strains proved to be resistant to gentamicin because of the presence of the aaca-aphd gene. although the prevalence of vre in debrecen is rather low, the appearance of multiple resistances is of concern.

TI  == characterization of the mechanisms of fluoroquinolone resistance in vancomycin-resistant enterococci of different origins.
AB  == the mutations in gyra and parc genes were analyzed in 22 vancomycin-resistant enterococci of different origins and species, which had varying susceptibility to ciprofloxacin (minimum inhibitory concentration, mic: 0.5- >256 mg/l). all vana or vanb2-containing strains with ciprofloxacin mic of >32 mg/l presented amino acid changes in gyra protein (s83i, s83y, s83r or s83i-e87g) with/without changes in parc protein (s80i or s80r or s80l). strains with lower ciprofloxacin mics presented the gyra and parc wild type. one vana-containing enterococcus durans strain with a ciprofloxacin mic of 64 mg/l presented the s83i and s80i changes in gyra and parc proteins, respectively. two vanb2 enterococcus faecium strains were typed by multi-locus-sequencetyping and both were ascribed to the cc17 clonal complex with two sequence-types (st78 and st17-like). all seven vancomycin-resistant and ciprofloxacin-resistant e. faecium strains showed ampicillin resistance (mic 32-256 mg/l), identifying the following amino acid changes in pbp5 protein: q461k, v462k, h470q, m485a, n496k, a499t, e525d, n546t,  a558t, g582s, k632q, p642l, e629v and p667s, together with a serine insertion at  position 466 . the 12 enterococcus gallinarum and enterococcus casseliflavus isolates included in the study exhibited an mic for ciprofloxacin in the range 0.5-16 mg/l and no amino acid changes were identified in gyra or parc proteins. specific mutations in gyra and parc genes are associated with fluoroquinolone resistance in e. faecium and e. durans of different origins.

TI  == species distribution and antimicrobial susceptibility of enterococci isolated from broilers infected experimentally with eimeria spp and fed with diets containing different supplements.
AB  == resistant bacteria in animal can be spread to environment and to humans. poultry  feed and infections caused by eimeria spp. are important factors in determining the intestinal microbial communities. the aim of this study was to verify the prevalence of species and antimicrobial susceptibility of enterococcus isolated from broilers fed with different supplements and infected experimentally with eimeria spp. broilers were divided in eight groups, fed with diets supplemented with a combination of antimicrobial, ionophore-coccidiostatics, probiotic, essential oil. at 14 days old all birds, except the control, received a solution  containing oocysts of eimeria spp. samples of cloacal swabs from broilers were collected. a total of 240 enterococcus sp. strains were isolated, confirmed genus by pcr, classified as species, tested for antimicrobial susceptibility and screened by pcr for the presence of tet(l), tet(m) and erm(b) genes. the overall  distribution of species isolated from fecal samples was e. faecalis (40%), followed by e. casseliflavus/e. gallinarum (10.8%), e. mundtii (10.8%), e. faecium (10.8%), e. columbae (5.8%) and e. gallinarum (4.2%). changes in the composition or frequency of enterococcus species were observed in all dietary supplementation. antimicrobial susceptibility tests showed resistance phenotypes  a range of antibiotics, especially used in humans such as, streptomycin, penicillin, rifampicin and vancomycin. there was no correlation between different supplementation for broilers and antimicrobial resistance and the presence of tet(m), tet(l) and erm(b) genes. dietary supplementation had effect on the enterococcus sp. colonization, but did not have significant effect on the phenotype and genotype of antimicrobial resistance in enterococci.

TI  == bacteriophage-mediated transduction of antibiotic resistance in enterococci.
AB  == aims: temperate bacteriophages are bacterial viruses that transfer genetic information between bacteria. this phenomenon is known as transduction, and it is important in acquisition of bacterial virulence genes and antimicrobial resistance determinants. the aim of this study was to demonstrate the role of bacteriophages in gene transfer (antibiotic resistance) in enterococci. methods and results: three bacteriophages from environmental samples isolated on pig host strains of enterococcus gallinarum and enterococcus faecalis were evaluated in transduction experiments. antibiotic resistance was transferred from ent. gallinarum to ent. faecalis (tetracycline resistance) and from ent. faecalis to enterococcus faecium, enterococcus hirae/durans and enterococcus casseliflavus (gentamicin resistance). conclusions: bacteriophages play a role in transfer of antibiotic resistance determinants in enterococci. significance and impact of the study: this study confirms previous suggestions on transduction in enterococci, in particular on interspecies transduction. interspecies transduction is significant because it widens the range of recipients involved in antimicrobial resistance transfer.

TI  == development of a dna microarray for enterococcal species, virulence, and antibiotic resistance gene determinations among isolates from poultry.
AB  == a dna microarray (enteroarray) was designed with probes targeting four species-specific taxonomic identifiers to discriminate among 18 different enterococcal species, while other probes were designed to identify 18 virulence factors and 174 antibiotic resistance genes. in total, 262 genes were utilized for rapid species identification of enterococcal isolates, while characterizing their virulence potential through the simultaneous identification of endogenous antibiotic resistance and virulence genes. enterococcal isolates from broiler chicken farms were initially identified by using the api 20 strep system, and the results were compared to those obtained with the taxonomic genes atpa, reca, phes, and ddl represented on our microarray. among the 171 isolates studied, five different enterococcal species were identified by using the api 20 strep system:  enterococcus faecium, e. faecalis, e. durans, e. gallinarum, and e. avium. the enteroarray detected the same species as api 20 strep, as well as two more: e. casseliflavus and e. hirae. species comparisons resulted in 15% (27 isolates) disagreement between the two methods among the five api 20 strep identifiable species and 24% (42 isolates) disagreement when considering the seven enteroarray identified species. the species specificity of key antibiotic and virulence genes identified by the enteroarray were consistent with the literature adding further  robustness to the redundant taxonomic probe data. sequencing of the cpn60 gene further confirmed the complete accuracy of the microarray results. the new enteroarray should prove to be a useful tool to accurately genotype strains of enterococci and assess their virulence potential.

TI  == the occurrence of virulence traits among high-level aminoglycosides resistant enterococcus isolates obtained from feces of humans, animals, and birds in south  korea.
AB  == enterococcus isolates (1500) obtained from the feces of 48 humans, 209 domesticated food animals, and 155 wild geese in south korea were characterized with respect to species status by pcr analyses and resistance to antibiotics. of  the 1500 strains examined, the majority (n=577) were enterococcus faecalis from 224 (54.4%) of the samples feces, while 299 were of e. faecium from 125 of the samples (30.3%), 224 were e. hirae from 101 (24.5%) of the samples, 94 were e. casseliflavus from 43 (10.4%) of the samples, and one was e. gallinarum. while 305 isolated from 125 (30.3%) of the samples were unidentified species. approximately 15, 60, 50, 55, 3, and 40% of samples obtained from beef cattle, chickens, ducks, swine, wild geese, and humans, respectively, yielded enterococcus isolates that were resistant to high-levels of aminoglycosides (i.e., of gentamicin, kanamycin, and streptomycin, minimum inhibitory concentrations were >1000 mg/l). the 180 enterococcus isolates that showed high levels of resistance to aminoglycoside antibiotics (hlar) were screened for virulence genes encoding for aggregation substance (agg), cytolysin activator (cyla), gelatinase (gele) and surface protein (esp). of those, the gele gene was  found most frequently in chickens and ducks of the hlar isolates, while 56 e. faecalis and 13 e. faecium hlar were gelatinase positive and showed hemolysin activity. multiple antibiotic resistant enterococcus isolates carrying virulence  genes were most frequently isolated from poultry and swine, and were mostly e. faecalis or e. faecium. these findings suggest that restriction of the use of antibiotics in food animal operations in south korea, especially those involved in poultry and swine production would be desirable.

TI  == antimicrobial and heavy metal resistance in commensal enterococci isolated from pigs.
AB  == antibiotic resistance in animal isolates of enterococci is of public health concern because of the risk of transfer of antibiotic resistance isolates or resistance determinants to consumers via the food chain. in this study, phenotypic and genotypic resistance in 192 pig isolates of enterococci to ampicillin, avilamycin, avoparcin, bacitracin, flavophospholipol, gentamicin, narasin, tetracycline, tiamulin, tylosin, vancomycin, virginiamycin, copper and zinc were investigated by susceptibility test and molecular methods. resistance rates varied between the species but all isolates were susceptible to ampicillin, avilamycin, avoparcin, gentamicin and narasin but resistant to tetracycline and tylosin and intermediately resistant to copper. only enterococcus gallinarum and  enterococcus casseliflavus were resistant to vancomycin and virginiamycin resistance was present in less than half the enterococcus faecium isolates. zinc  resistance was largely confined to enterococcus faecalis but bacitracin resistance was uncommon in e. faecalis in comparison with the other species. tiamulin resistance was common in all species except e. casseliflavus. resistance to flavophospholipol was detected in most e. faecium isolates and in a high proportion of e. gallinarum, e. casseliflavus and e. hirae/durans but was only found in one isolate of e. faecalis. no teto, rplc, rpld, vana, vanb, vata and vatd genes were found. the presence of ermb, tetl, tetm, tcrb, aac6-aph2, tetk, tets, vanc1, vanc2, lsaa, lsab and vate varied between the species and largely corresponded to the susceptibility phenotype. the findings show that resistance to antibiotics of high clinical significance for nosocomial enterococcus infections is absent, whereas antimicrobial resistance was detected for some other antibiotics including bacitracin, flavophospholipol, tetracycline, tiamulin, tylosin and virginiamycin.

AB  == the presence, distribution and expression of cassette chromosome recombinase (ccr) genes, which are homologous to the staphylococcal ccrab genes and are designated ccrab(ent) genes, were examined in enterococcal isolates (n=421) representing 13 different species. a total of 118 (28 %) isolates were positive for ccrab(ent) genes by pcr, and a number of these were confirmed by southern hybridization with a ccra(ent) probe (n=76) and partial dna sequencing of ccra(ent) and ccrb(ent) genes (n=38). ccrab(ent) genes were present in enterococcus faecium (58/216, 27 %), enterococcus durans (31/38, 82 %), enterococcus hirae (27/52, 50 %), enterococcus casseliflavus (1/4, 25 %) and enterococcus gallinarum (1/2, 50 %). in the eight other species tested, including enterococcus faecalis (n=94), ccrab(ent) genes were not found. thirty-eight sequenced ccrab(ent) genes from five different enterococcal species showed 94-100 % nucleotide sequence identity and linkage pcrs showed heterogeneity in the ccrab(ent) flanking chromosomal genes. expression analysis of ccrab(ent) genes from the e. faecium do strain showed constitutive expression as a bicistronic mrna. the ccrab(ent) mrna levels were lower during log phase than stationary phase in relation to total mrna. multilocus sequence typing was performed on 39 isolates. ccrab(ent) genes were detected in both hospital-related (10/29, 34 %) and non-hospital (4/10, 40 %) strains of e. faecium. various sequence types were  represented by both ccrab(ent) positive and negative isolates, suggesting acquisition or loss of ccrab(ent) in e. faecium. in summary, ccrab(ent) genes, potentially involved in genome plasticity, are expressed in e. faecium and are widely distributed in the e. faecium and e. casseliflavus species groups.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance of fecal indicators in municipal wastewater treatment plant.
AB  == antimicrobial resistance of fecal coliforms (n = 153) and enterococci (n = 199) isolates was investigated in municipal wastewater treatment plant (wwtp) based on activated sludge system. the number of fecal indicators (in influent and effluent as well as in the aeration chamber and in return activated sludge mixture) was determined using selective media. susceptibility of selected strains was tested against 19 (aminoglycosides, aztreonam, carbapenems, cephalosporins, beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitors, fluoroquinolones, penicillines, tetracycline and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole) and 17 (high-level aminoglycosides, ampicillin, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, fluoroquinolones, glycopeptides, linezolid, lincosamides, nitrofuration, streptogramins, tetracycline) antimicrobial agents respectively. among enterococci the predominant species were enterococcus faecium (60.8%) and enterococcus faecalis (22.1%), while remaining isolates belonged to enterococcus hirae (12.1%), enterococcus casseliflavus/gallinarum (4.5%), and enterococcus durans (0.5%). resistance to nitrofuration and erythromycin was common among enterococci (53% and 44%, respectively), and followed by resistance to ciprofloxacin (29%) and tetracycline (20%). the resistance phenotypes related to glycopeptides (up to 3.2%) and high-level aminoglycosides (up to 5.4%) were also observed. most frequently, among escherichia coli isolates the resistance patterns were found for ampicillin (34%), piperacillin (24%) and tetracycline (23%). extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing e. coli was detected once, in the aeration chamber. in the study the applied wastewater treatment processes considerably reduced the number of fecal indicators. nevertheless their number in the wwtp effluent was higher than 10(4) cfu per 100 ml and periodically contained 90% of bacteria with antimicrobial resistance patterns. the positive selection of isolates with antimicrobial resistance patterns was observed during the treatment processes. substantial concern should be paid to the isolates resistant to 3 or more chemical classes of antimicrobials (mar). in treated wastewater mar e. coli  and mar enterococci constituted respectively 9% and 29% of tested isolates.

TI  == enterococcus species composition determined by capillary electrophoresis of the groesl gene spacer region dna.
AB  == marine recreational beaches are monitored for fecal contamination by enterococcus spp. (ent) counts. although different ent species in the environment tend to thrive in and originate from distinct hosts, the current monitoring method does not differentiate among species. time-consuming isolation-based species identification precludes routine analysis of environmental ent communities. therefore, an isolation-independent dna fingerprinting method was developed to characterize environmental ent communities using dna length polymorphism of the spacer region between the groes and groel genes common to most ent species. capillary electrophoresis resulted in distinct peak sizes of pcr products that carried polymorphic groesl spacers (300-335 bp in length) among 8 different ent species (enterococcus avium, enterococcus gallinarum, enterococcus casseliflavus, enterococcus mundtii, enterococcus hirae, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus durans, and enterococcus faecalis). distortions in true species ratios observed in electropherograms were caused by pcr biases arising in a mixed ent community dna template. e. faecalis was overestimated and e. avium and e. faecium were underestimated compared to the original species ratios in the mixed community. the pcr product bias was constant between species, so good approximation of the species ratio in ent communities is possible. in environmental samples, a high percentage of e. faecalis (96%) together with high total ent counts were observed in samples collected from a sewer line and from several sites in a storm drain system where sewage leaks were suspected. in contrast, samples with <400 cfu 100  ml-1 ent were either dominated by e. mundtii or had 4 or more ent species. the latter ent community profiles are considered to be signatures of enterococci rarely associated with animals with low or of non-fecal origin.

TI  == characterization of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus isolates from broilers in selangor, malaysia.
AB  == vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre) is an emerging nosocomial pathogen in humans. the use of antibiotics in human therapy and in the production of food animals has been incriminated in the emergence of this organism. the present study describes the distribution of vre species, the vancomycin-resistant genes detected, the vancomycin resistance pattern observed, and the genetic diversity of the isolates found in live broiler chickens in malaysia. overall 140 vre were  isolated with species comprising enterococcus faecalis (48%), enterococcus faecium (25.7%), enterococcus gallinarum (12.1%), enterococcus casseliflavus (1.4%) and other enterococcus species (12.8%). vancomycin resistance gene vana and intrinsic genes vanc1 and vanc2/3 were detected in the study population. vana was detected in 15 (63.9%) of e. faecium, 23 (22.4%) of e. faecalis and in 3 (17.6%) e. gallinarum isolates. e-test was conducted on randomly selected 41 of the isolates and the minimum inhibition concentration (mic) of vancomycin for five (11.9%) of tested isolates is more than 256 mug/ml. genotypic analysis using random amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) showed genetic diversity within the enterococcus species.

TI  == prevalence and antibiotic resistance profiles of enterococcus species in chicken  at slaughter level; absence of vana and vanb genes in e. faecalis and e. faecium.
AB  == the prevalence of enterococci in neck skin samples of poultry from ankara region  in turkey was investigated and their antibiotic resistance patterns were determined. in the study, 83 of 106 analyzed neck skin samples were positive for  enterococcus, with e. faecium as the most prevalent species (48%) followed by e.  durans (23%) and e. faecalis (19%). lower numbers were detected for e. gallinarum, e. hirae, e. mundtii and e. casseliflavus. using the disc diffusion method, it was established that over 90% of e. faecium and e. faecalis isolates were high-level resistant against erythromycin and tetracycline. four e. faecium  isolates were additionally resistant to chloramphenicol, gentamicin and streptomycin, though they were susceptible to penicillin g. the most frequently observed multiple resistance in e. faecium (25%) was against erythromycin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol and streptomycin. of the e. faecalis isolates, 44%  were multiple resistant to erythromycin, tetracycline and streptomycin. vancomycin resistance could not be demonstrated phenotypically and vana or vanb genes were not detected by multiplex pcr in any of the isolates. nevertheless, the observed resistance patterns are of concern for public health.

TI  == enterococcus species distribution among human and animal hosts using multiplex pcr.
AB  == aims: this study evaluated the use of enterococcus species differentiation as a tool for microbial source tracking (mst) in recreational waters. methods and results: avian, mammalian and human faecal samples were screened for the occurrence of enterococcus avium, enterococcus casseliflavus, enterococcus durans, enterococcus gallinarum, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus hirae and enterococcus saccharolyticus using multiplex pcr. host-specific patterns of enterococcus species presence were observed only when data for multiple enterococcus species were considered in aggregate. conclusions: the results suggest that no single enterococcus species is a reliable indicator of the host faecal source. however, enterococcus species composite 'fingerprints' may offer auxiliary evidence for bacterial source identification. significance and impact of study: this study presents novel information on the enterococci species assemblages present in avian and mammalian hosts proximate to the nearshore ocean. these data will aid the development of appropriate mst strategies, and the approach used in this study could potentially assist in the identification of faecal pollution sources.

TI  == cross-transmission of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus in patients undergoing dialysis and kidney transplant.
AB  == the objective of this study was to investigate the occurrence of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre) cross-transmission between two patient groups (long-term dialysis and kidney transplant patients). molecular typing, by  automated ribotyping with the riboprinter microbial characterization system (qualicon, usa), was used to analyze vre isolates from 31 fecal samples of 320 dialysis patients and 38 fecal samples of 280 kidney transplant patients. clonal  spread of e. faecalis and e. casseliflavus was observed intragroup, but not between the two groups of patients. in turn, transmission of e. gallinarum and e. faecium between the groups was suggested by the finding of vancomycin-resistant isolates belonging to the same ribogroup in both dialysis and transplant patients. the fact that these patients were colonized by vre from the same ribogroup in the same health care facility provides evidence for cross-transmission and supports the adoption of stringent infection control measures to prevent dissemination of these bacteria.

TI  == characterization of enterococci populations collected from a subsurface flow constructed wetland.
AB  == aims: the aim of this study was to identify and characterize the population of enterococcus sp. in domestic wastewater as it flows through a constructed wetland. methods and results: four hundred and eighty-four enterococcus isolates  were collected from the inlet, various sites within and from the outlet of a plastic lined constructed wetland in college station, tx. the wetland treated septic tank effluent that passed sequentially through two 1.89 m(3) septic tanks  and a 1.89 m(3) pump tank allowing 48 l doses at a 24 l min(-1) rate. the enterococcus isolates were identified to species using the commercial biolog system. the 484 enterococcus isolates were comprised of ten different species, including enterococcus faecalis (30.6%), enterococcus pseudoavium (24.0%), enterococcus casseliflavus (12.8%), enterococcus faecium (11.2%), enterococcus mundtii (7.9%), enterococcus gallinarum (6.2%), enterococcus dispar (3.7%), enterococcus hirae (2.1%), enterococcus durans and enterococcus flavescens both 0.8%. of the 88 isolates collected from the inlet, only 9.1% of the isolates were identified as ent. faecalis and ent. pseudoavium (36.4%) was identified as the predominant species. whereas of the 74 isolates collected from the outlet, the predominant species were identified as ent. faecalis (29.7%). species identification varied among sites within the wetland, but often ent. faecalis was the predominant species. conclusions: our data suggest that while ent. faecalis is the predominant species of enterococcus found in domestic wastewater, the populations may shift during treatment as the wastewater flows through the constructed wetland. significance and impact of the study: we found that shifts in enterococcus species composition occurred during domestic wastewater treatment. this has implications for the identification of faecal pollution based on the presence of specific bacterial types associated with domestic wastewater.

TI  == vana in enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, and enterococcus casseliflavus detected in french cattle.
AB  == the goal of this study was to assess the presence of enterococci species presenting van-mediated glycopeptide resistance in french cattle. fecal samples were collected from healthy and sick animals, and enterococci were screened for vancomycin resistance. vancomycin resistance was principally encountered in enterococcus gallinarum and enterococcus casseliflavus strains. however, glycopeptide resistance was detected in three different species of enterococci (e. faecalis, e. faecium, and e. casseliflavus). molecular characterization of the genetic support proved that they all presented the prototypic vana element. interestingly, the e. casseliflavus strain displayed a remarkable vanb phenotype/vana-vanc genotype. transferability, associated resistances, and factors of vana cotransfer were sought. this study proved that acquired vana genes can still be detected in food-producing animals more than a decade after the avoparcin ban. indeed, calves, which are recurrently exposed to antibiotics in france, may allow the re-emergence of glycopeptide resistance through coselection factors, and this might potentially be concerning for human health.

TI  == molecular epidemiology of vancomycin-resistant enterococci in singapore.
AB  == aims: to characterise the mechanism of glycopeptide resistance, genetic relatedness, and pathogenicity factors in isolates of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) in singapore. methods: a total of 292 enterococcus faecium and  17 enterococcus faecalis were isolated from humans, and five e. faecium, two enterococcus durans, two enterococcus flavescens, one enterococcus casseliflavus, and one enterococcus gallinarum from chickens. the mechanism of glycopeptide resistance and pathogenicity factors were studied by pcr and the genetic relatedness determined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge), multi-locus variable number tandem repeat analysis (mlva), and tn1546 analysis. results: there were five outbreak clones among the vancomycin-resistant e. faecium with one clone predominant. four of the clones were vanb positive, and only one clone  carried vana. all outbreak clones were esp gene positive. sporadic human isolates and chicken isolates were vana positive and did not contain any pathogenicity genes. the situation was reversed in vancomycin-resistant e. faecalis where almost all isolates were vana positive. conclusions: most vre in singapore is hospital associated with a small number of clones of esp-positive vanb e. faecium responsible for the majority of isolates.

TI  == [glycopeptide-resistant enterococci carriage: are actual isolation and identification techniques sufficient?].
AB  == the monitoring of infection by glycopeptide-resistant enterococci (gre) is one of the main elements of hospital hygiene policy. it involves systematic rectal swabs in clinics at risk (asymptomatic carriage). aim: we compare two gre screening methods and evaluate a new kit associating multiplex pcr and hybridization (genotype((r)) enterococcus, hain lifescience) on a panel of 448 samples collected over a 4-month period. patients and methods: the first method is based  on direct inoculation of the sample; the second one involves a preliminary enrichment phase followed by molecular diagnosis allowing the identification of species of enterococci as well as glycopeptide resistance genes. results: all the resistant strains were isolated using the enrichment technique. the incidence of  gre (vana) carriage was 0,55% (two out of 362 patients, two out of 448 isolates)  with two enterococcus faecium vana. six enterococcus gallinarum vanc1 and two enterococcus casseliflavus vanc2/c3 were also isolated and identified. the main clinics concerned are intensive care and hematology. the two patients with e. faecium vana had been previously given glycopeptides for 10 days. for three strains, the molecular method allowed to correct prior erroneous results based on rapid identification (rapidid32strep v2.0). conclusion: the method using direct samples inoculation underestimates real incidence of gre carriage. the performances of genotype((r)) enterococcus molecular method, evaluated for other  parameters using reference strains and dna sequencing, offer new possibilities applicable to routine laboratory.

TI  == enterococcus faecalis with the gelatinase phenotype regulated by the fsr operon and with biofilm-forming capacity are common in the agricultural environment.
AB  == the prevalence of gelatinase activity and biofilm formation among environmental enterococci was assessed. in total, 396 enterococcal isolates from swine and cattle faeces and house flies from a cattle farm were screened for gelatinase activity. the most prevalent phenotype on todd-hewitt agar with 1.5% skim milk was the weak protease (wp) (72.2% of isolates), followed by the strong protease (sp) 18.7%, and no protease (np) (9.1%). the majority of wp isolates was represented by enterococcus hirae (56.9%), followed by enterococcus faecium (25.9%), enterococcus casseliflavus (10.4%), enterococcus gallinarum (5.2%) and enterococcus saccharolyticus (1.7%). all wp isolates were negative for gele (gelatinase) and spre (serine protease) as well as the fsrabdc operon that regulates the two proteases, and only four isolates (7.0%) formed biofilms in vitro. all sp isolates were enterococcus faecalis positive for the fsrabdc, gele, spre genes and the majority (91.2%) formed a biofilm. diversity of np isolates was relatively evenly distributed among e. hirae, e. faecium, e. casseliflavus, e. gallinarum, enterococcus durans, e. saccharolyticus and enterococcus mundtii.  all np isolates were negative for the fsr operon and only four e. hirae (11.1%) formed a biofilm. of further interest was the loss of the gelatinase phenotype (18.9% of isolates) from sp isolates after 4 month storage at 4-8 degrees c and several passages of subculture. results of reverse transcription pcr analysis indicated that mrna was produced for all the genes in the frs operon and sequencing of the gele gene did not reveal any significant mutations. however, gelatinase was not detectable by western blot analysis. our study shows that e. faecalis with the complete fsr operon and the potential to form a biofilm are relatively common in the agricultural environment and may represent a source/reservoir of clinically relevant strains. in addition, many environmental  enterococci, especially e. hirae, produce an unknown wp that can hydrolyse casein but does not contribute to biofilm formation. the stability of the gelatinase phenotype in e. faecalis and its regulation will require additional studies.

TI  == the homogeneity of vanb gene cluster among enterococcal isolates in iran.
AB  == aims: this study aimed to analyse the diversity of the vanb gene cluster in enterococcal species isolated from sewage treatment plants (stp) in tehran, iran. methods and results: the enterococcal isolates were collected from three sewage treatment plants in tehran, iran, during 2005. a total of 203 enterococcal isolates, collected over six rounds of sampling from three stps were tested for the presence of vanb gene. long-pcr showed that amongst the isolates, three enterococcus faecium, one enterococcus gallinarum and one enterococcus casseliflavus harboured the complete vanb gene cluster. restriction fragment length polymorphism (rflp) of the vanb1 gene cluster (5900 bp) from the isolates  showed an identical pattern to a standard strain of enterococcus faecalis (v583). none of the isolates were able to transfer the vanb gene in conjugation experiments. different pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns were obtained for the three e. faecium isolates with vanb gene clusters. conclusions: our results indicated that the dissemination of vanb is not widespread in tehran. although only a few vanb positive isolates were detected, vanb was found in several enterococcal species. significance and impact of the study: in view of the lack of information on vanb resistance genes and their diversity in iran, knowledge of the global dissemination of vanb genes in enterococcus spp. is noteworthy.

TI  == prevalence and characterization of enterococcus spp. isolated from brazilian foods.
AB  == enterococci can be used in the food industry as starter or probiotic cultures. however, enterococci are also implicated in severe multi-resistant nosocomial infections. in this study, the prevalence of enterococci in selected brazilian foodstuffs (raw and pasteurized milk, meat products, cheeses and vegetables) was  evaluated. phenotypic and pcr protocols were used for species identification. tests for production of gelatinase, haemolysin, bacteriocin and bile salt hydrolysis were done with all enterococci isolates, whereas molecular determination of virulence markers (genes esp, gel, ace, as, efaa, hyl and cyla)  and antibiotic resistance was checked only for enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis isolates. the antibiotic-resistant isolates were assayed for biofilm formation and adhesion to mammalian cells. from the 120 food samples  analyzed, 52.5% were positive for enterococci, meat and cheese being the most contaminated. e. faecium was the predominant species, followed by e. faecalis, e. casseliflavus and enterococcus gallinarum. phenotypic tests indicated that 67.7%  of isolates hydrolyzed bile salts, 15.2% produced bacteriocin, 12.0% were beta-hemolytic and 18.2% produced gelatinase. antibiotic resistance (gentamicin,  tetracycline and erythromycin) and genes encoding for virulence traits were more  frequent in e. faecalis than in e. faecium. three e. faecium isolates were resistant to vancomycin. among antibiotic-resistant isolates, 72.4% of e. faecalis were able to form biofilm and 13.8% to adhere to caco-2 cells. antibiotic-resistant e. faecalis and e. faecium isolates were grouped by rapd-pcr and a scattered distribution was noted, indicating that resistance was not related to a particular clone. the spread of virulence/resistance traits in isolates of the two species and different rapd-types suggest the pathogenic potential of both species. by contrast, the recovery of bacteriocinogenic e. faecium isolates with no virulence traits suggests their potential for biotechnological applications. in conclusion, our results showed that enterococci from brazilian foods present important dualist aspects for food safety.

TI  == comparative analysis of genetic diversity and incidence of virulence factors and  antibiotic resistance among enterococcal populations from raw fruit and vegetable foods, water and soil, and clinical samples.
AB  == a comparative study was carried out among enterococci isolated from fruits and vegetable foods, water and soil, and clinical samples. results indicate strong differences in the numbers of enterococcal species found in different environments as well as their abundance. while enterococcus faecalis was clearly  the predominant species in clinical samples, enterococcus faecium predominated in vegetables, and it slightly outnumbered e. faecalis in water samples. other species (enterococcus hirae, enterococcus mundtii, enterococcus durans, enterococcus gallinarum and enterococcus casseliflavus) were found more frequently in vegetables, water, and specially in soil. isolates from vegetable foods showed a lower incidence of antibiotic resistance compared to clinical isolates for most antimicrobials tested, especially erythromycin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, gentamicin and streptomycin for e.  faecalis, and quinupristin/dalfopristin, ampicillin, penicillin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, rifampicin, choramphenicol, gentamicin and nitrofurantoin for e. faecium. e. faecium isolates from vegetable foods and water showed an average lower number of antibiotic resistance traits (2.95 and 3.09 traits for vegetable  and water isolates, respectively) compared to clinical samples (7.5 traits). multi-resistant strains were also frequent among clinical e. faecalis isolates (5.46 traits on average). none of e. faecalis or e. faecium isolates from vegetable foods, water and soil showed beta-haemolytic activity, while 25.64% of  clinical e. faecalis did. a 51.28% of e. faecalis clinical isolates tested positive for the cyla, cylb, cylm set of genes, while some or all of these genes  were missing in the rest of isolates. in clinical e. faecalis and e. faecium isolates, the genetic determinants for the enterococcal surface protein gene (esp), the collagen adhesin gene (ace) and the sex pheromone gene ccf (as well as cob in e. faecalis) showed a clearly higher incidence compared to isolates from other sources. e. faecalis isolates from vegetable foods and water had much lower average numbers of virulence genetic determinants per strain (4.23 and 4.0, respectively) compared to clinical isolates (8.71). similarly, among e. faecium the lowest average number of traits per strain occurred in vegetable food isolates (1.72) followed by water (3.9) and clinical isolates (4.73). length heterogeneity (lh)-pcr typing with espf-acef-ccff and espf-ccff primers revealed  genomic groups that clearly differentiated clinical isolates from those of vegetable foods, water and soil (except for two clinical isolates). the large differences found in the incidence of antibiotic resistance and virulence factors and in the genetic fingerprints determined by lh-pcr suggest a clear separation of hospital-adapted populations of enterococci from those found in open environments.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance profiles of enterococci isolated from poultry meat and pasteurized milk in rio de janeiro, brazil.
AB  == the enterococci are important nosocomial pathogens with a remarkable capacity of  expressing resistance to several antimicrobial agents. their ubiquitous nature and resistance to adverse environmental conditions take account for their ability to colonize different habitats and for their potential for easy spreading through the food chain. in the present study we evaluated the distribution of species and antimicrobial susceptibility among enterococcal isolates recovered from food obtained in retail stores in rio de janeiro, brazil. the following species were identified among 167 isolates obtained from poultry meat and 127 from pasteurized milk: enterococcus faecalis (62.6%), e. casseliflavus (17.3%), e. durans (6.5%),  e. gallinarum (3.0%), e. gilvus (2.4%), e. faecium (2.0%), e. hirae (1.4%), and e. sulfureus (1.0%). the overall percentages of antimicrobial resistant isolates  were: 31.2 % to tetracycline, 23.8% to erythromycin, 11.3% to streptomycin, 4.3%  to chloramphenicol, 3.9% to gentamicin, 1.4% to norfloxacin, 1.1% to imipenem, 0.7% to ciprofloxacin, nitrofurantoin, and penicillin, and 0.4% to ampicillin. intermediate resistance was detected in frequencies varying from 0.5% for linezolid to 58.2% for erythromycin. none of the isolates showed resistance to glycopeptides. high-level resistance to aminoglycosides was observed in 13.1% of  the isolates. multiresistance was observed in e. faecalis, e. casseliflavus, e. faecium, e. gallinarum, e. durans and e. gilvus.

AB  == the aim of the work was the evaluation of different pcr-based methods to found an appropriate identification and typing strategy for environmental enterococci. environmental enterococci were isolated mainly from surface- and waste-waters. species identification was provided by combination of phenotypic (micronaut system, merlin) and molecular detection methods (fluorescent its-pcr, ddl-pcr, rep-pcr, aflp). very similar results were observed among molecular methods, however several discrepancies were recognized during comparison of molecular and  biochemical identification. seven enterococcal species (e. faecium, e. hirae, e.  casseliflavus, e. mundtii, e. faecalis, e. durans and e. gallinarum) were identified within 166 environmental isolates. the results obtained in this work attest the importance of pcr-based methods for identification and typing of environmental enterococci. the fluorescent its-pcr (fits-pcr) showed the best results in order to identify the enterococci strains, the method used the automated capillary electrophoresis to separate the pcr products in a very rapid  and precise way. the aflp method was suitable to identify and characterize the isolates, while the rep-pcr can be used for species identification.

TI  == [a 6-year study of glycopeptides-resistant enterococci in 3 intensive care units  of the university hospital of montpellier].
AB  == aim of the study: the aim of this study was to evaluate the rate of glycopeptides-resistant enterococci (gre) fecal carriage (species and resistance  determinants). strains isolated between 1999 and 2005 during systematic screening for multiresistant bacteria in patients hospitalized in 3 intensive care units (icu) of the university hospital of montpellier were studied. methods: the systematic screening was weekly performed. rectal swabs were cultured on d-coccosel agar medium containing 4 mg/l vancomycin and mics for vancomycin and teicoplanin were determined by e-test. strains were subjected to both phenotypic  and genotypic identification and vana, vanb and vanc genes were detected by pcr.  results: we analyzed 13003 samples for 5113 patients. among them, 401 (7.84%) patients were gre carriers with 280 enterococcus gallinarum (vanc(1)), 102 enterococcus casseliflavus-flavescens (vanc(2)-c(3)), 5 enterococcus faecalis (3  vana, 2 vanb), and 14 enterococcus faecium (10 vana, 4 vanb). a unique case of cross contamination between two patients was observed. during the same time, only one strain of gre was isolated during an infectious process in another unit. carriage rate of e. faecium and e. faecalis vana or vanb was 0.37%: 68.4, 21 and  10.6% in the gastrointestinal, in the polyvalent and the respiratory icu, respectively. conclusion: our results were in agreement with national data showing a relatively low gre fecal carriage rate in icus, e. faecium vana being the mainly encountered gre. since 2004, gre detection is increasingly reported in france and an emerging e. faecium vana clone has been identified during outbreaks. in contrast, only one e. faecium vanb strain has been isolated in our  institution since this date and a unique strain of e. faecalis vana was isolated  during an infectious process since 1999. these data underlined the efficacy of transmission prevention measures established when gre are identified.

TI  == assessment of safety of enterococci isolated throughout traditional terrincho cheesemaking: virulence factors and antibiotic susceptibility.
AB  == enterococci account for an important fraction of the adventitious microflora of traditional cheeses manufactured in mediterranean countries from small ruminants' raw milk and play an important role in the development of suitable organoleptic characteristics of the final product. it has been suggested that animals used for food or animals that supply edible products are a reservoir of antibiotic-resistant enterococci. the main purpose of this research effort was thus to identify, to the species level, a total of 73 enterococci with high tolerance to acidic ph and bile salts (as prevailing environmental conditions in  the first portion of the gastrointestinal tract), which were previously isolated  from the milk feedstock to the final product of terrincho cheesemaking, and to determine their profiles of antibiotic susceptibility, coupled with the occurrence of specific virulence factors (especially in those that might eventually be claimed to exhibit suitable probiotic and technological performances). isolates, identified by both api 20 strep and pcr methods, were found to belong to the following enterococcus species: e. casseliflavus, e. durans, e. faecalis, e. faecium, and e. gallinarum. susceptibility of those isolates was observed to most antibiotics tested, whereas none harbored aminoglycoside resistance genes. pcr screenings for cytolysin genes (cyll(l), cyll(s), cylm, cylb, and cyla), surface adhesin genes (efaa(fs), efaa(fm), and esp), the aggregation protein gene (agg), and the extracellular metalloendopeptidase gene (gele) were performed. all isolates proved negative for cyll(l), cylm, cylb, and agg genes. both e. faecalis strains were positive for the cell wall-associated protein esp and the cell wall adhesin efaa(fs), whereas  the cell wall adhesin efaa(fm) was detected in 11 of the 12 e. faecium strains. only one strain possessed the cyll(s) determinant, and another possessed the cyla gene. incidence of virulence determinants was thus very low; hence, the enterococcal adventitious microflora tested is essentially safe.

TI  == high prevalence of tetracycline resistance in enterococcus isolates from broilers carrying the erm(b) gene.
AB  == a total of 73 isolates of enterococcus spp. carrying the erm(b) gene were obtained from cloacal swabs of broiler chickens derived from 13 different farms in belgium. the erm(b) gene encodes resistance to macrolides, lincosamides and streptogramin b antibiotics (mls(b)). the isolates belonged to eight different species: enterococcus avium (eight isolates), enterococcus casseliflavus (11 isolates), enterococcus cecorum (eight isolates), enterococcus durans (seven isolates), enterococcus faecalis (10 isolates), enterococcus faecium (17 isolates), enterococcus gallinarum (seven isolates) and enterococcus hirae (five  isolates). acquired resistance to tetracycline was detected in 68 of the isolates, and in 62 of these it was associated with the presence of the resistance genes tet(l), tet(m), tet(o) or tet(s). in three e. faecium isolates that were phenotypically susceptible to tetracycline, tet(l) or tet(m) was present. the transposon integrase gene (int gene) of the tn916/tn1545 transposon  family was detected in 18 of the 54 isolates that contained the tet(m) gene. it was concluded that acquired resistance to tetracycline antibiotics is often present in enterococci from poultry carrying the erm(b) gene. the use of tetracyclines in poultry may therefore co-select for resistance to mls(b) antibiotics, which may be important as alternative therapy for enterococcal infections in humans.

TI  == epidemiology and molecular characterization of vancomycin resistant enterococci isolates in india.
AB  == little attention has been paid to the problem of the spread of vancomycin resistant enterococci (vre) in india. between august 2002 to march 2003, faecal and urine samples of patients from various wards of the postgraduate institute of medical education and research, chandigarh, india, were screened for vancomycin resistance. 36 vre were isolated (18 enterococcus gallinarum, 9 e. casseliflavus, 7 e. faecium and 2 e. faecalis). these isolates were characterized as low-, moderate- and high-level resistant strains by phenotypic as well as genotypic methods such as minimum inhibitory concentration determination, polymerase chain  reaction assays, sequencing of pcr products and multiple sequence alignment of van genes. correlations established between these results and the vancomycin resistance markers were designated as vana (783 bp), vanb (635 bp), vanc1 (822 bp) and vanc2 (484 bp) according to the findings of earlier workers as well as comparison with existing databases. prolonged hospital stay and vancomycin were important risk factors for both vre uti and colonization. renal dialysis, renal failure, prior aminoglycoside and third generation cephalosporin were the other significant factors for vre uti. the study also highlights the importance of screening for vre in clinical samples and recommends the institution of control measures to prevent the further spread of vre.

TI  == molecular identification and diversity of enterococci isolated from slovak bryndza cheese.
AB  == three hundred and eight presumed enterococcal isolates were recovered from bryndza, a soft sheep milk cheese. the cheese samples were obtained from five different commercial distributors in slovakia and were taken at three different seasonal intervals. all isolates were identified to the species level using genotypic tools. species-specific pcr using ddl genes highlighted the predominance of enterococcus faecium (176 isolates) and assigned 50 isolates to the species enterococcus faecalis. the remaining 82 isolates were classified using repetitive element sequence-based polymerase chain reaction (pcr) with primer (gtg)(5)-(gtg)(5)-pcr, in combination with phenylalanyl-trna synthase gene (phes) sequence analysis and by whole-cell protein analysis (sds-page). these strains were identified as enterococcus durans (59 strains), enterococcus italicus (8 strains), enterococcus casseliflavus (3 strains), enterococcus gallinarum (3 strains), enterococcus hirae (1 strain), and 8 strains were members of the species lactococcus lactis. of the seven enterococcal species isolated, three of them, e. durans, e. faecalis and e. faecium were present in all samples  studied, with e. faecium as the predominant one. the precise identification of enterococci in bryndza cheese is an essential step in the process of evaluation of their functional properties which will be further studied and assessed.

AB  == the phoenix system (becton dickinson diagnostic systems, sparks, md) was evaluated for identification (id) to the species level of streptococci and enterococci. two hundred clinical isolates were investigated: beta-hemolytic streptococci (n = 50), streptococcus pneumoniae organisms (n = 46), viridans group streptococci (n = 31), enterococcus faecium (n = 36), enterococcus faecalis (n = 25), and other catalase-negative cocci (n = 12). the api system (biomerieux, marcy l'etoile, france) was used as a comparator. molecular methods (sequencing of 16s rrna and zwf and gki genes and ddl gene amplification) were used to investigate discordant results. upon resolution of discrepancies, correct species id was achieved by the phoenix system for 121/129 (93.8%) streptococci and 63/70  (90.0%) enterococci. excellent results were obtained for s. pneumoniae (45/45) and beta-hemolytic streptococci (49/50). with regard to viridans streptococci, the accuracy of the phoenix system was 83.9%. among the latter organisms, the best performance was obtained with isolates of the streptococcus sanguinis group  and streptococcus anginosus group; problems were instead encountered with the streptococcus mitis group. four e. faecium and three e. faecalis isolates were misidentified as enterococcus casseliflavus/enterococcus gallinarum or enterococcus durans. thus, these isolates were identified only at the genus level. compared with commercially available systems, the phoenix system appears a reliable diagnostic tool for identifying clinically relevant streptococci and enterococci. the smic/id-2 panel proved particularly effective for beta-hemolytic streptococci and pneumococci.

TI  == assessment of two commercial susceptibility test methods for determination of daptomycin mics.
AB  == daptomycin is a lipopeptide antibiotic with activity against several important gram-positive bacterial pathogens, including drug-resistant staphylococci and enterococci. because the mechanism of action of daptomycin is calcium-dependent depolarization of the cell membrane, susceptibility testing requires medium supplemented with a physiological level of calcium. this study assessed two food  and drug administration-cleared commercial test devices for determination of daptomycin mics, etest and justone. a collection of 220 selected isolates, including staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, e. avium, e. durans, e. casseliflavus, and e. gallinarum, were tested by both methods. included in the collection were 22 s. aureus and 14  enterococcus sp. isolates that were recovered from patients and were nonsusceptible on the basis of the daptomycin mics. as the reference method for comparison, all isolates were tested by the clinical and laboratory standards institute broth microdilution method incorporating cation-adjusted mueller-hinton broth with 50 microg/ml calcium. daptomycin mics agreed, within 1 twofold dilution, for 97% of the isolates by etest and for 100% by justone. however, daptomycin mics determined by etest were 1 dilution lower than the reference mics for 65% of the enterococcus sp. isolates tested. this resulted in 28.5% very major (vm) errors (4/14) with enterococci (all e. faecium) but none (0/22) with staphylococci. use of justone yielded mics that were 1 dilution lower than the reference mics for 69% of the staphylococci and 25% of the enterococci. this resulted in 13.6% vm errors (3/22) with staphylococci and 14.3% vm errors (2/14)  with enterococci. the manufacturer-recommended justone inoculum preparation resulted in mean colony counts of only 5 x 10(4) to 1 x 10(5) cfu/ml in the wells of the strip. increasing the inoculum to 3 x 10(5) to 4 x 10(5) cfu/ml eliminated two of five vm errors upon retesting. no major interpretive errors occurred with  either device. in summary, daptomycin mics generated by the etest or justone method generally agreed within 1 dilution of the reference daptomycin mics. however, both devices produced slightly lower mics that resulted in some vm errors.

AB  == enterococcal infection has become a major clinical problem and e. faecalis and e. faecium are the most frequently isolated species. however, the isolation of other species (e. casseliflavus, e. gallinarum, e. durans) from clinical materials was  reported recently. the aim of this study was to evaluate drug resistance of 97 species of enterococci isolated from clinical specimens of upper silesian health  center of child and mother in katowice. each strain was tested for susceptibility to vancomycin, teicoplanin, aminoglycosides (gentamycin and streptomycin) and synercid (quinupristine/ dalfopristine) by the e-test method. fifty three percent of studied enterococci demonstrated high level aminoglycoside resistance (hlar) (mic > 1024 microg/ml). sixty three strains of e. faecalis were sensitive to vancomycin (mic 1-4 microg/ml), but 5 strains demonstrated low sensitivity (3 strains with mic = 6 microg/ml and 2 strains with mic = 24 microg/ml). all studied enterococci were sensitive to teicoplanin (mic < 2 microg/ml). a high percentage of e. faecium (70%) resistant to synercid was demonstrated (mic = 2-24 microg/ml). infection control and monitoring of antibiotic sensitivity among isolated hospital strains may prevent the transmission of resistant strains in a  pediatric hospital.

TI  == virulence of enterococcus isolates collected in lower silesia (poland).
AB  == 148 enterococcal strains: e.faecalis (108), e.faecium (35), e.gallinarum (3), e.casseliflavus (1) and e.durans (1) from various clinical specimens were investigated for their ability to adhere to caco-2 and hep-2 cell lines, and also for the presence of the esp gene, biofilm formation, production of haemolysins, dnase and lipase. several types of enterococcal adhesion to both cell lines were  noted. an aggregative adherence was the most frequent among e.faecalis and e.faecium isolates. other species presented various adhesive types. the occurrence of virulence factors in the whole group of strains was as follows: esp gene in 53.4%, biofilm in 45.3%, haemolysins in 15.5%, dnase in 12.2% and lipase  in 33.1% of enterococcal isolates. it appears that the adherence of the enterococci studied was not significantly associated with the presence of virulence factors.

TI  == [vca agar (biomerieux) for selective isolation of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) from fecal specimens].
AB  == screening for vancomycin resistant enterococci (vre) is recommended for preventing nosocomial infections with vre. the aim of this study was to assess the performance of vca3 agar (biomerieux) in vre isolation from fecal specimens.  220 specimens were cultured on vca3 agar, which contains vancomycin and in parallel, on cap agar (oxoid), which is vancomycin-free. 36 vancomycin resistant  enterococci were isolated: 24 isolates of enterococcus faecium expressed a high-level resistance to vancomycin and 12 isolates of e. gallinarum/casseliflavus exhibited resistance at low-level. the sensitivity of vca3 appeared greater than that of cap for vre isolation: 92% (22/24) vs 79% (19/24) for e. faecium (ns, p>0.05) ; 83% (10/12) vs 50% (6/12) for e. gallinarum/casselliflavus (ns, p>0.05). as expected, initial cultures of multiple gram positive organisms were far more frequent on cap agar than on vca3 agar. the isolation rate of vancomycin susceptible gram positive strains was impressively lower on vca3 medium than on cap medium. vca3 agar avoided therefore additional subcultures, useless identification and susceptibility tests. in conclusion, vca3 medium could be useful for the direct, rapid and selective isolation of vre from  fecal specimens.

TI  == prevalence and molecular epidemiology of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) strains isolated from animals and humans in korea.
AB  == background: to assess the possibility of vre transmission from animals to humans, we studied the prevalence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) in farm animals, raw chicken meat, and healthy people. we then determined the molecular relatedness of vre isolates between animals and humans in korea. methods: we aimed to isolate vre from 150 enterococci specimens of farm animals, 15 raw chicken meat samples, and stools from 200 healthy people. species differentiation was done with conventional biochemical tests. vancomycin resistance genotyping was done by polymerase chain reaction (pcr). using the agar dilution method, antimicrobial susceptibility was tested for 8 antimicrobials and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) was done to evaluate the molecular relatedness of vre isolates. results: the prevalence of vre was 14.7% (22/150) in farm animal specimens, 1% (2/200) in healthy people, and 60% (9/15) in raw chicken meat. of 22 animal vre isolates, 1 vana e. faecium, 15 vanc1 e. gallinarum, and 6 vanc2 e. casseliflavus were identified. all of the 9 vre from raw chicken meat and all of  the 20 clinical vre strains were vana e. faecium. however, in healthy people, only 2 vanc2 e. casseliflavus were isolated. these showed low-level resistance to vancomycin and susceptibility to teicoplanin. however, 9 vre strains from raw chicken meat had high-level resistance to vancomycin (mic(50,90): >128 microg/ml), teicoplanin (mic(50,90): >128 microg/ml), ampicillin (mic(50,90): >128 nicrog/ml), erythromycin (mic(50.90): >128 microg/ml), and tetracycline (mic(50/90): 128/>128 microg/ml). conclusion: this study demonstrated little evidence of vre colonization in healthy people despite high recovery of vre among raw chicken meat. it is suggested that there is little evidence of vre transmission from animals to healthy people. however, we assumed that there exists the possibility of vre contamination during the processing of chicken meat.

TI  == contribution of enterococci to the spread of antibiotic resistance in the production chain of swine meat commodities.
AB  == thirty-six samples, including fecal specimens, dry feedstuffs, raw and processed  pork meat products, and dry fermented sausages, were collected from two production chains of swine meat commodities and analyzed for the presence of 11 antibiotic resistance (ar) genes. specific pcr assays carried out on dna extracted directly from the samples revealed a high incidence of the genes tet(k) (80.5%), ermb (66.7%), and tet(m) (66.7%). feces and feedstuffs gave the largest  number of positive amplifications. to elucidate the contribution of enterococci to the occurrence and spread of ar, 146 resistant enterococci were isolated, and  their identity, genetic fingerprints, and ar gene profiles were determined by means of molecular techniques. enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium were the predominant isolated species (43.8 and 38.4%, respectively); other enterococcus species identified were e. durans (8.9%), e. hirae (2.7%), e. gallinarum (2.1%), e. mundtii (2.1%), and e. casseliflavus (2.1%). a number of isolates displayed a complex ar gene profile comprising up to four different resistance determinants. the genes tet(m) and ermb were highly diffused, being present in 86.9 and 84.9%, respectively, of the isolates. the application of amplified fragment length polymorphism fingerprinting was particularly valuable to monitor the resistant enterococcal isolates along the production chain and to  individuate steps in which contamination might occur. in fact, isolates of e. faecalis and e. faecium showing the same amplified fragment length polymorphism profile and ar gene pattern were detected in samples taken at different steps of  the food chain suggesting three cases of bacterial clonal spread.

TI  == genetic diversity and safety aspects of enterococci from slightly fermented sausages.
AB  == aims: to determine the biodiversity of enterococci from slightly fermented sausages (chorizo and fuet) at species and strain level by molecular typing, while considering their safety aspects. methods and results: species-specific pcr and partial sequencing of 16s rrna and soda genes were used to identify enterococcal population. enterococcus faecium was the most frequently isolated species followed by e. faecalis, e. hirae and e. durans. randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd)-pcr revealed species-specific clusters and allowed strain  typing. sixty strains of 106 isolates exhibited different rapd profiles indicating a high genetic variability. all the e. faecalis strains carried virulence genes (efaafs, esp, agg and gele) and all e. faecium isolates carried efaafm gene. enterococcus faecalis showed higher antibiotic resistance than the other species. only one e. faecium strain showed vana genotype (high-level resistance to glycopeptides) and e. gallinarum and e. casseliflavus/flavescens isolates showed vanc1 and vanc2/c3 genotypes (low-level resistance only to vancomycin) respectively. conclusions: e. faecalis has been mainly associated with virulence factors and antimicrobial multi-resistance and, although potential risk for human health is low, the presence of this species in slightly fermented  sausages should be avoided to obtain high quality products. significance and impact of the study: the enterococcal population of slightly fermented sausages has been thoroughly characterized. several relevant safety aspects have been revealed.

TI  == emergence of unusual species of enterococci causing infections, south india.
AB  == background: enterococci tend to be one of the leading causes of nosocomial infections, with e. faecalis and e. faecium accounting up to 90% of the clinical  isolates. nevertheless, the incidence of other species of enterococci from clinical sources shows an alarming increase with the properties of intrinsic resistance to several antibiotics including beta-lactams and glycopeptides. thus  proper identification of enterococci to species level is quintessential for management and prevention of these bacteria in any healthcare facility. hence this work was undertaken to study the prevalence of unusual species of enterococci causing human infections, in a tertiary care hospital in south india. methods: the study was conducted in a tertiary care hospital in south india from  july 2001 to june 2003. isolates of enterococci were collected from various clinical specimens and speciated using extensive phenotypic and physiological tests. antimicrobial susceptibility testing were performed and interpreted as per nccls guidelines. whole cell protein (wcp) fingerprinting of enterococci were done for species validation by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) and analyzed computationally. results: our study showed the prevalence of unusual (non-faecalis and non-faecium enterococci) and atypical (biochemical variant) species of enterococci as 19% (46 isolates) and 5% (12 isolates) respectively. the 7 unusual species (46 isolates) isolated and confirmed by phenotypic characterization includes: 15 e. gallinarum (6.2%), 10 e. avium (4.1%), 6 e. raffinosus (2.5%), 6 e. hirae (2.5%), 4 e. mundtii (1.7%), 3 e. casseliflavus-including the two atypical isolates (1.2%) and 2 e. durans (0.8%). the 12 atypical enterococcal species (5%) that showed aberrant sugar reactions in conventional phenotyping were confirmed as e. faecalis, e. faecium and e. casseliflavus respectively by wcp fingerprinting. the antimicrobial susceptibility testing depicted the emergence of high-level aminoglycoside and beta-lactam resistance among different species apart from intrinsic vancomycin resistance by some species, while all the species tested were susceptible for linezolid and teicoplanin. conclusion: our study reveals the emergence of multi-drug resistance among unusual species of enterococci posing a serious therapeutic challenge. precise identification of enterococci to species level enables us to access the species-specific antimicrobial resistance characteristics, apart from knowing the epidemiological pattern and their clinical significance in human infections.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance of enterococcus sp. isolated from the intestinal tract of patients from a university hospital in brazil.
AB  == this study reports the results about antimicrobial resistance of enterococcus spp. isolated from intestinal tract of patients from a university hospital in brazil. the identification of strains at species level was performed by conventional biochemical tests, api 20 strep (biomerieux), and polymerase chain reaction assay. the species distribution was e. faecium (34%), followed by e. faecalis (33%), e. gallinarum (23.7%), e. casseliflavus (5.2%), e. avium (1%), and e. hirae (1%). intrinsic resistance to vancomycin characterized by presence of vanc genes was found in e. gallinarum and e. casseliflavus. the high prevalence of vanc phenotype enterococci is very important because these species  have been reported as causing a wide variety of infections. vancomycin-resistant  e. faecium or e. faecalis were not found and no one isolate of these species was  a beta-lactamase producer. thirteen clinical isolates of enterococci (13.4%) showed multiresistance patterns, which were defined by resistance to three classes of antibiotics plus resistance to at least one aminoglycoside (gentamicin and/or streptomycin). the resistance to several antimicrobials shown by enterococcal strains obtained in this study is of concern because of the decrease in the therapeutic options for treatment of infections caused by enterococci.

TI  == identification of clinically relevant enterococcus species by direct sequencing of groes and spacer region.
AB  == we determined the groesl sequences (groes, groel, and the intergenic spacer) of 10 clinically relevant enterococcus species and evaluated the feasibility of identifying enterococcus species on the basis of these sequences. seven common clinical enterococcus species, e. faecalis, e. faecium, e. casseliflavus, e. gallinarum, e. avium, e. raffinosus, and e. hirae, and three less common enterococcus species, e. cecorum, e. durans, and e. mundtii, were examined in this study. we found that the groes genes of these enterococcal species are identical in length (285 nucleotides) and contain an unusual putative start codon, gtg. the lengths and sequences of the intergenic regions (spacers between  the groes and groel genes) are quite variable (17 to 57 bp in length) among enterococcus species but are conserved in strains within each species, with only  a few exceptions. considerable variation of groes or groel sequences was also observed. the evolutionary trees of groes or groel sequences revealed similarities among enterococcus species. however, the overall intraspecies variation of groes was less than that of groel. the high interspecies variation and low intraspecies variation indicate that the groes and spacer sequences are more useful than groel for identification of clinically relevant enterococcus species. the sequences of these two genetic traits, groes and spacer, can be determined by a single pcr and direct sequencing and may provide important information for the differentiation of closely related species of enterococcus.

TI  == no regional spread of vancomycin-resistant enterococci with vana or vanb in kitakyushu, japan.
AB  == outbreaks of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) infection occur sporadically  in japan, and their frequency has been gradually increasing. we experienced a nosocomial outbreak of vre in two hospitals in the city of kitakyushu, and the spread of vre strains was suspected in this area. to examine the prevalence rate  of infection and colonization of vre in kitakyushu, we screened a total of 24 297 clinical samples from patients in hospitals and clinics in kitakyushu from october through december 2002 for vre. the isolates screened as positive for vre  accounted for 2.3% (566/24 297) of the tested clinical samples. polymerase chain  reaction (pcr) analyses for vana, vanb, vanc1, and vanc2/3 were performed to confirm the screening test results. neither vana nor vanb genes were detected in  any isolates. the 265 vanc1-positive isolates were enterococcus gallinarum, and the 150 vanc2/3-positive isolates were e. casseliflavus. other enterococcus species were negative in this pcr-detection test. in this study, the pcr procedure was considered reliable and successful because although neither vana nor vanb was detected, vanc1 and vanc2/3 were completely detectable. therefore, we concluded that the regional spread of vre with vana and vanb had not occurred  in kitakyushu in 2002. in the near future, the prevalence of vre with vana or vanb is likely to increase in japan, as it has in other countries. we should continue to find and prevent nosocomial outbreaks of infection and colonization by vre.

TI  == drug resistance in fecal enterococci in hong kong.
AB  == our purpose was to estimate the rate of carriage of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) in hospitalized patients in a district hospital and in healthy  subjects in the community in hong kong. rectal swabs were collected from all patients admitted to the intensive care unit, and stool specimens were collected  from all patients presenting with suspected antibiotic-associated diarrhea over a 2-month period. stool specimens were also collected from healthy subjects in the  community. specimens were enriched and cultured on selective media for the isolation of enterococci. all isolates were identified, and their minimum inhibitory concentration for vancomycin was determined. susceptibility to other antibiotics was investigated. samples yielded 125 isolates of enterococci, the majority of isolates being enterococcus faecalis (75) and e. faecium (35). nine of 11 strains of e. gallinarum and 2 of 2 strains of e. casseliflavus isolated from hospitalized patients were intermediately resistant to vancomycin, but no strains highly resistant to vancomycin were isolated. resistance to other drugs,  including the fluoroquinolones, was present, and a high-level resistance to gentamicin and streptomycin was found in 37% and 46% of strains, respectively. colonization with vre remains low in hong kong. this result is supported by the low level of isolation of vre from infections in the region and may be attributable to low levels of vancomycin use. high-level aminoglycoside resistance and fluoroquinolone resistance are common, and continued monitoring for vre is suggested.

TI  == [detection of vancomycin-resistant enterococci by a fully automated microbiology  system, raisus].
AB  == a fully automated microbiology system, raisus recently developed (nissui pharmaceuticals co., ltd., tokyo) was evaluated for identification of enterococci and for detection of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre). when a total of 124  enterococcal isolates were tested, raisus correctly identified 122 (98.4%) isolates. two isolates resulted in species-identifications disagreed with the reference but agreed as belonging to the genus of enterococcus. when a total of fifty-seven vre isolates confirmed to be positive for vana and/or vanb genes were tested against vancomycin, the current raisus susceptibility program version 1.76 could detect 41 (71.9%) isolates of vre as having > or = 32 microg/ml mic for vancomycin, but one was intermediate (mic, 8.0 microg/ml) and the remaining 15 vanb-type isolates were incorrectly interpreted as vancomycin-susceptible (mic, < or = 4.0 microg/ml). the test program based on the algorism to determine bacterial growth in the presence of vancomycin was developed and evaluated. with  this test program, all the vre isolates positive for vana and/or vanb genes were  identified as being vancomycin-resistant or intermediate interpretation. however, eight of 19 clinical isolates of e. casseliflavus and e. gallinarum intrinsically possessing vanc gene were determined as being < or = 4.0 microg/ml mic for vancomycin. with the influence of program revision, raisus became to incubate the test plate longer than with the current program, but 50% of enterococcal isolates including vancomycin-resistant and vancomycin-susceptible isolates were determined within 5 hour-incubations and 90% were within 9 to 10 hour-incubations. with these results, we can conclude that the revised test program for enterococcal isolates could rapidly and correctly identify vancomycin-resistance, and will be applicable to the routine susceptibility test  in clinical laboratories.

TI  == [antibiotic susceptibility analysis of enterococcus spp. isolated from urine].
AB  == recently increase of enterococcal infections has been observed. these bacteria, mainly enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium are members of the normal flora of gastrointestinal tract but also are typical opportunistic pathogens. enterococci are characterized by natural resistance to numerous antibiotics (among them cephalosporins), and also by easy acquired resistance to antibiotics. infections caused by multiresistant strains are difficult in treatment, chronic,  recurrent and sometimes fatal are described. enterococcal infections are caused often by e. faecalis, rarely by e. faecium. in the last years other species of enterococci have been isolated from different clinical materials (e. casseliflavus, e. avium, e. durans, e. gallinarum). the aim of this study was to  analyze the antibiotics susceptibility of enterococcus spp. isolated from urine of children with urinary tract infection (uti), hospitalized in the upper silesian health center of child and mother or treated ambulatory. susceptibility  of the 130 strains of e. faecalis and 41 e. faecium to: penicillin, tetracycline, high level of aminoglycoside (gentamycin 120 microg and streptomycin 300 microg), glycopeptides (vancomycin and teicoplanin), ciprofloxacin and nitrofurantoin was  estimated. all isolated strains of e. faecalis (100%) were sensitive to glycopeptides (vancomycin and teicoplanin) and to nitrofurantoin, 96% strains were sensitive to penicillin, 43% to ciprofloxacin and 28% to tetracycline. all strains of e. faecium were sensitive to glycopeptides (vancomycin and teicoplanin), 32% strains were sensitive to penicillin, 19% to tetracycline 14% to ciprofloxacin and 50% to nitrofurantoin. twenty two strains of e. faecalis (17%) and twelve strains of e. faecium (29%) were demonstrated high level resistance to aminoglycosides (hlar). among hlar strains of enterococci, were observed strains of high level resistance only to streptomycin, high level resistance only to gentamycin and high level resistance to both aminoglycosides.  the hlar strains of e. faecalis and e. faecium were also resistant to other antibiotics: penicillin, tetracycline and ciprofloxacin. the most frequent cause  of child urinary tract infection was e. faecalis, with high sensitivity to penicillins, glycopeptides and nitrofurantoin. the increased role of e. faecium and other strains of enterococci also has been shown. these species demonstrated  sensitivity to glycopeptides, but resistance to other antibiotics, routinely used for treatment of uti as well as to nitrofurantoin.

TI  == evaluation of the prevalence and risk factors for colonization by vancomycin-resistant enterococcus among patients on dialysis.
AB  == background: vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre) has been reported among long-term dialysis patients, although risk factors for vre colonization are not well defined. this study aims to appraise the prevalence and risk factors for vre colonization among patients on long-term dialysis therapy, as well as the mechanisms for dissemination of vancomycin resistance. methods: this is a cross-sectional survey of 320 patients on long-term dialysis therapy at 2 hospitals of the federal university of sao paulo from june 2001 to march 2003. fecal samples were collected from each patient once a week for 1 month. samples with positive test results for vre were submitted to molecular typing through automated ribotyping. results: vre prevalence was 14.4%. there were significant associations between vre and dialysis type (hemodialysis, p = 0.04), number of hospitalizations (p = 0.03), low hemoglobin level (p = 0.03), and leukocytosis (p = 0.05). among samples with vre (n = 56), 25% were enterococcus faecium; 10.7%, enterococcus casseliflavus; 57.1%, enterococcus gallinarum; and 3.6%, enterococcus faecalis. all samples isolated were sensitive to teicoplanin, except for e faecium samples, which were strongly resistant, although 9 of 14 patients with this isolate presented the same ribogroup (111-s-4). typing of 6 samples from 8 dialysis patients with e gallinarum was performed, showing a predominant ribogroup (112-s-4). conclusion: hospital environment, hemodialysis, anemia, and  leukocytosis appear to be associated with vre colonization. these results suggest that dissemination of these bacteria among patients on long-term dialysis therapy may be taking place.

AB  == a total of 123 genetically-unrelated strains of enterococcus spp. strains (51 enterococcus faecalis, 57 enterococcus faecium, 10 enterococcus gallinarum, and 5 enterococcus casseliflavus) were phenotypically identified by biochemical profiles and by using an automated method. the strains were also analyzed by a pcr assay to assess the accuracy of the phenotypically-based methods for identification of enterococcus spp. with this aim, a pcr assay using different cell targets, which allows simultaneous detection of glycopeptide-resistant genotypes as well as identification to the species level by means of different gene targets, was used as the gold standard method. all 51 strains of e. faecalis were correctly identified, whereas 48 of 57 strains (84.2%) of e. faecium, were correctly identified. all of the strains of e. gallinarum and 3 out of 5 strains  of e. casseliflavus were also correctly identified. the overall results showed that it is possible to identify enterococcus spp. at the molecular level in less  than 30 hours, compared with the 48-96 hours required for the phenotypically-based methods. the excellent accuracy of the pcr assay in identifying these species, particularly e. faecium, must also be emphasized. these findings may have implications for the routine clinical identification of enterococci species.

TI  == molecular study of vancomycin-resistant enterococci isolated from humans and from food in a cattle-rearing area of france.
AB  == objectives: study possible links between vancomycin-resistant enterococci strains isolated from human stool samples and from pork or poultry food products. methods: one hundred and eleven vancomycin-resistant enterococci strains (15 vana and 96 vanc) were isolated from human stool samples and from pork or poultry food products. characterization of the tn1546-like element of the 15 vana strains was  realized by restriction analysis of pcr products and polymorphism study. the 96 strains of vanc phenotype (75 enterococcus gallinarum and 21 enterococcus casseliflavus) were analysed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge). results: in the study described here, polymorphism of the tn1546-like element enabled the  establishment of five groups. groups iii, iv and v were found only in human strains. groups i and ii were found to occur in strains isolated from humans and  from food, suggesting a possible transfer of the tn1546-like element. the isolates from group i harboured the whole tn1546 element. in group ii, the five strains possessed a novel tn1546-like element, characterized by a single-nucleotide difference in the vanx gene and a deletion upstream from the nucleotide 164. analysis by pfge of the 75 e. gallinarum strains revealed 20 different patterns. one pattern was shared by isolates from pork food and human samples. none of the 21 e. casseliflavus strains tested was found to share similar pfge patterns. conclusions: results tend to support the possible transfer of the tn1546-like element between strains of vana phenotype. concerning vanc phenotype strains, the transfer was not demonstrated.

TI  == prevalence and molecular characterization of tetracycline resistance in enterococcus isolates from food.
AB  == in the present study, a collection of 187 enterococcus food isolates mainly originating from european cheeses were studied for the phenotypic and genotypic assessment of tetracycline (tc) resistance. a total of 45 isolates (24%) encompassing the species enterococcus faecalis (n = 33), e. durans (n = 7), e. faecium (n = 3), e. casseliflavus (n = 1), and e. gallinarum (n = 1) displayed phenotypic resistance to tc with mic ranges of 16 to 256 microg/ml. eight of these strains exhibited multiresistance to tc, erythromycin, and chloramphenicol. by pcr detection, tc resistance could be linked to the presence of the tet(m) (n  = 43), tet(l) (n = 16), and tet(s) (n = 1) genes. in 15 isolates, including all of those for which the mic was 256 micro g/ml, both tet(m) and tet(l) were found. furthermore, all tet(m)-containing enterococci also harbored a member of the tn916-tn1545 conjugative transposon family, of which 12 erythromycin-resistant isolates also contained the erm(b) gene. filter mating experiments revealed that  10 e. faecalis isolates, 3 e. durans isolates, and 1 e. faecium isolate could transfer either tet(m), tet(l), or both of these genes to e. faecalis recipient strain jh2-2. in most cases in which only tet(m) was transferred, no detectable plasmids were acquired by jh2-2 but instead all transconjugants contained a member of the tn916-tn1545 family. sequencing analysis of pcr amplicons and evolutionary modeling showed that a subset of the transferable tet(m) genes belonged to four sequence homology groups (shgs) showing an internal homology of  > or = 99.6%. two of these shgs contained tet(m) mosaic structures previously found in tn916 elements and on lactobacillus and neisseria plasmids, respectively, whereas the other two shgs probably represent new phylogenetic lineages of this gene.

AB  == the quinolone resistance determining regions of gyra and parc in four species of  enterococci from environmental samples with reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin were sequenced. the nucleotide sequence variations of parc could be related to the different enterococcal species. mutations in enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium related to reduced susceptibility were identical to mutations detected in e. faecalis and e. faecium of clinical origin. a minimal inhibitory concentration of 8 microg ml(-1) to ciprofloxacin was not associated with any mutations in the gyra and parc gene of enterococcus casseliflavus and enterococcus gallinarum. these two species may be intrinsically less susceptible  to ciprofloxacin.

AB  == the clinical significance and virulence potential of enterococcus casseliflavus/flavescens and enterococcus gallinarum are still uncertain. we retrospectively analyzed 56 cases of significant bacteremia caused by e. casseliflavus or e. gallinarum. of these cases, 25 (44.6%) were associated with polymicrobial bacteremia, and 43 (76.8%) were associated with entry via the biliary tract. resistance to vancomycin was observed in 17 (30.4%) of these 56 patients, and this resistance was significantly associated with e. gallinarum bacteremia (adjusted odds ratio [aor], 10.56; 95% confidence interval [ci], 2.41-46.27) and bacteremia without biliary tract origin (aor, 6.74; 95% ci, 1.44-31.67). the crude mortality rate was 13%, and the bacteremia-related mortality rate was 1.9%. in conclusion, bacteremia due to e. casseliflavus and e. gallinarum is commonly associated with biliary tract disease and may be associated with a low risk of mortality.

TI  == in vitro activity of daptomycin against vancomycin-resistant enterococci of various van types and comparison of susceptibility testing methods.
AB  == the increasing prevalence of vancomycin-resistant enterococcal (vre) infections and the limited number of antimicrobial agents for their treatment emphasize a need for new, more effective agents. in this study, the in vitro activity of daptomycin was determined against a collection of 156 vre from seven different institutions. van types were characterized by pcr, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis was performed to exclude isolates with >85% relatedness by dendrogram. included were 126 enterococcus faecium (109 vana, 17 vanb) isolates,  5 enterococcus faecalis (3 vana, 2 vanb) isolates, 2 enterococcus avium (vana) isolates, 1 enterococcus durans (vana) isolate, 10 enterococcus gallinarum (vanc1) isolates, and 12 enterococcus casseliflavus (vanc2) isolates. mics of daptomycin and five additional agents were determined by the nccls broth microdilution method with mueller-hinton (mh) broth containing supplemental calcium. mics were also determined using two investigational e-test strip formulations, and disk diffusion testing was performed by the standard nccls method. the mic of daptomycin at which 50% of the isolates tested were inhibited  for this isolate collection was 4 microg/ml, and the mic at which 90% of the isolates tested were inhibited was 8 microg/ml. two isolates of vana e. faecium were resistant to linezolid, and one isolate was resistant to quinupristin-dalfopristin. mics of daptomycin determined by the e test with and without added calcium varied by 8- to 16-fold, and disk diffusion zones varied by 3 to 6 mm according to the calcium content of the commercial mh agar lots used in the study. this study has shown daptomycin to have good activity against a diverse collection of contemporary vre isolates. however, improved standardization of the calcium content of mh agar will be important for reliable  testing of daptomycin by clinical laboratories using either the e test or disk diffusion methods.

TI  == species distribution and antibiotic resistance patterns of enterococci isolated from food of animal origin in germany.
AB  == presently, enterococci take the third place of bacterial pathogens associated with nosocomial infections, after staphylococci and escherichia coli. especially, the resistances of enterococci to several available antibiotics are threatening.  we attempted to determine which species of enterococci could be found in food of  animal origin and their significance according to their antibiotic resistances for human beings. from november 2000 to may 2002 we investigated 155 samples of food of animal origin bought in retail outlets in germany: 27 samples of sausages, 19 of ham, 83 of minced meat, 26 of cheese. from these food samples we  isolated 416 enterococcal strains. the most frequent species was enterococcus faecalis (299 strains); furthermore, we found enterococcus faecium (54 strains),  enterococcus durans together with enterococcus hirae (24 strains), enterococcus casseliflavus (22 strains), enterococcus avium (9 strains) and enterococcus gallinarum (8 strains). we focused on the resistance patterns of 118 selected e.  faecium and e. faecalis strains to 13 antimicrobial active agents (ampicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, avilamycin, chloramphenicol, enrofloxacin, erythromycin, flavomycin, gentamicin, penicillin, quinupristin/dalfopristin, teicoplanin, tetracycline and vancomycin). from the clinical point of view, the situation of antibiotic resistance to the examined antimicrobial agents seemed to be favourable. the investigated strains were sensitive to ampicillin and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. these antibiotics are, in combination with an aminoglycoside, for example gentamicin, agents of choice for the treatment of enterococcal infections in human medicine. only one e. faecium strain was resistant to penicillin, while all strains were sensitive to the glycopeptide antibiotics, vancomycin and teicoplanin. resistances found against the antibiotics, tetracycline, quinupristin/dalfopristin and erythromycin, are causes for concern.

TI  == species identification and detection of vancomycin resistance genes in enterococci of animal origin by multiplex pcr.
AB  == a multiplex pcr assay for the differentiation of species and detection of vancomycin (van) resistance genes in enterococci was established. three hundred sixty-seven enterococcal strains isolated from food were selected from a sample collection and were examined with regards to the existence of four vancomycin resistance genes (vana, vanb, vanc1 and vanc2) and to species differentiation (e. faecalis, e. faecium, e. casseliflavus and e. gallinarum) by multiplex pcr. apart from unambiguous results for the majority of strains, the e. faecium specific primers used here, showed weak points in the specificity and sensitivity, respectively. despite these rare instances, we succeeded in optimising the multiplex pcr assay by variation of annealing temperature and primer combination. the assay presented here, with its optimised parameters, is therefore suitable for routine use and because of time and material saving, it is an alternative and rapid method in comparison to conventional tests.

TI  == taxonomy, ecology and antibiotic resistance of enterococci from food and the gastro-intestinal tract.
AB  == apart from genotypic identification methods, there is a need for reliable conventional phenotypic identification schemes for simple and rapid determination of enterococcal species in food or in the gastro-intestinal tract (git). only a limited number of enterococcal species is of importance for the ecology of the git or the food microflora, including e. faecalis, e. faecium, e. durans/hirae, e. gallinarum and e. casseliflavus. after genus identification the differentiation within these species can include, e.g. mannitol and arabinose fermentation and growth at 50 degrees c. widely used commercial identification systems may fail to precisely identify rare species. ecological aspects should also be taken into account. in the human git e. faecium is the most common species whereas in most animal species e. faecalis is at least present in the same amount. especially in foods of animal origin (cheese, pork meat, beef, poultry meat) also e. faecalis is very frequent. this is of special interest as glycopeptide resistance is most often found in human clinical e. faecium strains  as well as in e. faecium from the environment or animal samples and less frequent in e. faecalis strains. eu experts propose as safety criteria for probiotics in feed additives the exclusion of resistances or the lack of transferability. this  proposal can also be applied to enterococci in foods. specific resistances must be excluded, but transferability or acquisition of resistance (e.g. vancomycin) cannot be excluded per se. however, technologically used strains should differ from clinical strains concerning their resistance patterns and transfer rates.

TI  == mechanism of metronidazole-resistance by isolates of nitroreductase-producing enterococcus gallinarum and enterococcus casseliflavus from the human intestinal  tract.
AB  == enterococcus casseliflavus and enterococcus gallinarum strains resistant to metronidazole, nitrofurantoin and nitrofurazone were isolated from fecal samples  of a patient with recurrent ulcerative colitis treated with metronidazole. unlike other metronidazole-resistant bacteria, these strains produced nitroreductase but metabolized metronidazole to compounds that could not be detected by liquid chromatography with uv or mass spectral analysis. metronidazole-susceptible clostridium perfringens grew equally well in spent cultures of enterococcus spp.  incubated with or without metronidazole. these data indicate that the nitroreductases produced by these enterococcus strains did not activate metronidazole to bactericidal metabolites and these bacteria may reduce the effectiveness of metronidazole. we have indirect evidence for an alternative pathway that results in metronidazole resistance. these strains of enterococcus had nitroreductase so resistance should not have occurred.

AB  == objective: to determine the prevalence of stool colonization with vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) among healthcare workers (hcws) and their  families. design: prospective assessment of fecal colonization with vre. setting: a 603-bed, tertiary-care teaching hospital. participants: healthy volunteers recruited from hospital employees and their households were screened to exclude pregnancy, diabetes mellitus, immunosuppressive disorders, and recent use of antimicrobials. intervention: self-obtained stool swabs were used to obtain cultures. isolated enterococci were screened for vancomycin resistance and species were identified. intra-household isolates were genotyped using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge). results: the participants (n = 228; age  range, 28 days to 80 years) were from 137 households with and 91 without employees who had contact with patients. enterococcus species were isolated from  127 stool specimens (55.7%). vre were detected in 12 individuals, representing 6  e. casseliflavus, 5 e. faecium, and 1 e. gallinarum. vre were more commonly isolated in employees who had contact with patients (5 of 52 vs 0 of 40; relative risk [rr], 1.9; 95% confidence interval [ci95], 1.5 to 2.2; p = .07) and their household members (10 of 137 vs 2 of 91; rr, 3.3; ci95, 0.7 to 14.8; p = .13). in 2 households (2 adults in a physician's household and an adult plus a child in a  nurse's household) pfge analysis demonstrated identical intra-household strains of vancomycin-resistant e. faecium. conclusions: vre colonization was found in 5.3% of screened stools and was more prevalent in hcws who had contact with patients and their households. identical pfge patterns between 2 employees who had contact with patients and their household members demonstrated probable intra-household spread. although the mode of acquisition was uncertain, the association with employees who had contact with patients suggests possible occupational sources. these findings demonstrate the spread of vre within the household and implicate occupational risk for its acquisition.

TI  == identification of enterococci and determination of their glycopeptide resistance  in german and austrian clinical microbiology laboratories.
AB  == objective: to determine exactly how german and austrian routine laboratories perform tests for the identification of enterococci and determination of their glycopoptide resistance. methods: six enterococcal test strains with different types of glycopeptide resistance (enterococcus faecium, vana; e. faecalis, vana;  e. faecium, vanb; e. faecalis, vanb; e. gallinarum, vanc1; e. casseliflavus, vanc2) were sent as anonymous isolates to 73 clinical microbiology laboratories (65 in germany; eight in austria). the participating laboratories had to identify the strains up to the species level and to determine their antibiotic susceptibilities to the glycopeptides vancomycin and teicoplanin by the test method(s) that are used daily in the corresponding laboratories. results: the analysis of the results received from 62 laboratories (56 from germany, six from  austria) demonstrated that the most used routine method in susceptibility testing was the agar diffusion test, followed by the etest, and the microbroth dilution procedure. the majority of participants had no difficulties in susceptibility testing with the vana-type strains. however, the agar diffusion test was often not able to recognize clearly the vanb and vanc strains; some problems also arose with vanb isolates in the etest. with the microbroth dilution method, the corresponding type of glycopeptide resistance was correctly determined in the majority of enterococcal test strains. difficulties also arose in identification, especially with the vanc strains (e. gallinarum and e. casseliflavus), which were often falsely identified as e. faecium. the reasons for these errors are obviously based on the lack of important tests (such as motility and presence of  a yellow pigment) in some commercially available identification test kits.

TI  == composition of enterococcal and streptococcal flora from pigeon intestines.
AB  == aims: to identify the streptococcal and enterococcal components of the microflora from pigeon intestines to species level by tdna-intergenic polymerase chain reaction. methods and results: gram-positive coccal strains were isolated from the intestines or faeces of 50 different pigeons, all from different lofts, on columbia cna blood agar. sodium azide-sensitive enterococci were found to constitute the major coccal members of the intestinal flora of pigeons. forty-two of 69 isolates were identified as enterococcus columbae (84% of animals tested positive), while e. cecorum was encountered in 28% of all animals (14 isolates).  minor species (less than 10% of pigeons positive) were e. faecalis, e. faecium, e. gallinarum, e. casseliflavus, streptococcus alactolyticus and strep. gallolyticus. contrary to the species description of e. columbae and e. cecorum,  some of the strains were found to be motile. certain other minor differences with the species description of e. columbae are also indicated. conclusions: enterococcus columbae is the major gram-positive facultatively anaerobic component of the pigeon intestinal flora. certain phenotypic characteristics differ from the original species description. the potentially pathogenic strep. gallolyticus is a minor component of the microflora. enterococcus faecium and e.  faecalis are rare in pigeons. significance and impact of the study: the enterococcal and streptococcal flora of pigeons is composed of mainly host-specific bacteria. these are not likely to act as zoonotic pathogens nor as  carriers of antibiotic resistance determinants possibly spreading to humans.

TI  == the duel study: a multi-center in vitro evaluation of linezolid compared with other antibiotics in the netherlands.
AB  == objective: to evaluate bacterial susceptibility to linezolid in the netherlands in comparison with other antibiotics. methods: bacterial strains were isolated between september 1999 and january 2000 from patients presumed to require antibiotic treatment. the in vitro activity of 1226 strains from 34 participating laboratories was tested against linezolid, vancomycin, teicoplanin, oxacillin, penicillin, erythromycin, ampicillin and other antibiotics against enterococci, coagulase-negative staphylococci, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae. minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) were obtained with the e test on mueller-hinton agar: every laboratory included control strains. for vancomycin and teicoplanin only, brain-heart infusion agar and an inoculum of 2.0 mcfarland  was used for staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci and enterococci to support a better growth and clear recognition of hetero-resistant  colonies. results: the values of mic90 for linezolid were 1.5, 0.75, 0.75 and 1 mg/l for staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, streptococcus pneumoniae and enterococci, respectively. six enterococcal strains with decreased susceptibility against vancomycin or teicoplanin were identified as enterococcus  faecium, e. gallinarum and e. casseliflavus (two strains each) and they were found to harbor vana, vanc1 and vanc2/3 genes, respectively. nine per cent of streptococcus pneumoniae (an increase from 1% 4 years ago) showed decreased susceptibility to erythromycin, of both the ermb and mefe type; there was no cross-resistance with linezolid. twelve coagulase-negative staphylococcal strains were resistant to teicoplanin. conclusion: linezolid is a promising drug in the treatment of infections caused by gram-positive cocci. cross-resistance with other antibiotics tested was not found.

TI  == [epidemiological study on vancomycin-resistant enterococci from fecal samples in  the east area of japan].
AB  == recently, vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) have become important nosocomial pathogens in the world. in japan, the vre-infection was first reported in 1996. however, an epidemiological study on vre has not been aggressively done in japan. we conducted a survey study to explore the incidence and antimicrobial susceptibility of vancomycin-resistant enterococci isolated from fecal samples at 45 hospitals in the east area of japan (kanto, koshinetsu, tohoku, and hokkaido)  during june 1998 to march 1999. the enterococcosel agar containing vanocomycin (bbl) was used for screening vre from fecal samples in each hospital. the susceptibilities of the isolates to 8 antimicrobials were determined by the broth microdilution method and the definitions of resistance were based on current standards of the nccls standards. the vre genotypes (vana, vanb, vanc1, and van c2/3) were confirmed by amplifying the respective genes by pcr. eight hundred and ninety four strains of enterococci were tested by the microtiter plates hybridization method (wakunaga seiyaku, japan). one thousand five hundred eighty  three strains of enterococci were collected from 6,914 patients in 45 hospitals.  these strains included 72 (4.5%) strains enterococcus faecalis, 33 (2.1%) strains enterococcus faecium, 17 (1.1%) strains enterococcus avium, 1,040 (65.7%) strains enterococcus gallinarum, 386 (24.4%) strains enterococcus cassliflavus, and 35 (2.2%) strains enterococcus flavescens. these strains of vancomycin-resistant e.  faecalis were isolated from 3 patients, two of these 3 strains had van a gene and other one had van b gene. those 3 strains were in the kanto area, and 2 of 3 strains were in tokyo, generally, though van a type vre was highly resistaant to  both vancomycin and teicoplanin. in our study, two strains of van a type e. faecalis were highly resistant to vancomycin (mics > 128 micrograms/ml) and susceptible to teicoplanin with mics 4 micrograms/ml. those two strains were different in susceptibilities of minocycline and ofloxacin. the result of the analysis of pfge had also different patterns. vanb type e. fecalis was highly resistant to vancomycin and susceptible to teicoplanin (mics 0.25 microgram/ml).  for ampicillin and imipenem, 3 strains of e. faecalis were susceptible (mic < or  = 1 microgram/ml). one of 562 strains of e. gallinarum had vanb and vanc1 genes and was moderately resistant to vancomycin and susceptible to teicoplanin. all strains of e. casseliflavus and e. flavescens had vanc2/c3 gene only. all strains of e. faecium and e. avium did not detect van genes. from this result, it was supposed that vre were very rare in the east of japan.

TI  == the in vitro activity of daptomycin against 514 gram-positive aerobic clinical isolates.
AB  == the in vitro activity of daptomycin was assessed in comparison with that of vancomycin and penicillin against a wide range of gram-positive aerobic clinical  isolates. mics were determined by an agar dilution method on mueller-hinton agar  (nccls/eucast) and on isotonic agar adjusted to contain 50 mg/l free calcium (bsac). both media were enriched with 5% horse blood for fastidious organisms. daptomycin mics for all 172 staphylococci, including methicillin-susceptible and  methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus haemolyticus, were 0.03-0.5 mg/l. for 99 of the 100 enterococci (enterococcus faecalis, n = 50; enterococcus faecium, n = 50), including 37 vancomycin-resistant isolates, they were 0.25-2 mg/l. for all 108 beta-haemolytic streptococci, including streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus agalactiae, daptomycin mics were 0.016- 0.25 mg/l; for 101 alpha-haemolytic streptococci, including streptococcus pneumoniae and 'viridans' streptococci, they were 0.016-2 mg/l. for miscellaneous vancomycin-resistant isolates including lactobacillus spp., lactococcus spp., leuconostoc spp., pediococcus spp. and isolates of enterococcus casseliflavus and enterococcus gallinarum, daptomycin mics were 0.03-2 mg/l; mics for the seven isolates of listeria monocytogenes were 0.25-4 mg/l. there was little difference between the results on mueller-hinton agar and  on supplemented isotonic agar the discrepant results occasionally obtained tended to be one dilution higher on supplemented isotonic agar. daptomycin was active (mics < or = 2 mg/l) against all the isolates tested with the exception of one isolate each of e. faecium and l. monocytogenes (mics = 4 mg/l). our results indicate that daptomycin mics are independent of methicillin and vancomycin mics.

TI  == bile salt hydrolase activity of enterococci isolated from food: screening and quantitative determination.
AB  == one hundred seventeen enterococcal strains isolated from food (47 enterococcus faecium, 48 enterococcus faecalis, 16 enterococcus durans, 2 enterococcus gallinarum, 3 enterococcus casseliflavus, and 1 enterococcus malodoratus) were screened for bile salt hydrolase (bsh) activity on de man, rogosa, and sharpe agar medium containing taurocholic acid and calcium chloride. the highest incidence of bsh-active strains was observed for e. faecalis (81%) followed by e. faecium (50%) and e. durans (44%). isolates were grouped into four putative activity groups (no, low, medium, and high activity) based on the size of precipitation zones observed in the screening experiment. our results showed that assumptions on bsh activity based on the size of bile precipitation zones in screening experiments did not correlate with actual activity as quantified by high-pressure liquid chromatography, but the screening assay is useful for assessing the presence or absence of bsh activity.

(< or = 11 mm, resistant; > or = 18 mm, susceptible), 5% of the vancomycin-resistant strains tested would have been considered fosfomycin resistant. minimal inhibitory concentrations of most vancomycin-resistant isolates were in the intermediate sensitivity range, yielding an mic50 of 32 mg/l and an mic90 of 64 mg/l. moreover the majority of inhibitory zone sizes by the disc diffusion method (din 58940) corresponded to intermediate susceptibility. these results suggest that fosfomycin at a high dosage and possibly used in combination with other drugs could be a potentially useful drug for the treatment of infections caused by vancomycin-resistant enterococci.

TI  == evidence for horizontal gene transfer in evolution of elongation factor tu in enterococci.
AB  == the elongation factor tu, encoded by tuf genes, is a gtp binding protein that plays a central role in protein synthesis. one to three tuf genes per genome are  present, depending on the bacterial species. most low-g+c-content gram-positive bacteria carry only one tuf gene. we have designed degenerate pcr primers derived from consensus sequences of the tuf gene to amplify partial tuf sequences from 17 enterococcal species and other phylogenetically related species. the amplified dna fragments were sequenced either by direct sequencing or by sequencing cloned  inserts containing putative amplicons. two different tuf genes (tufa and tufb) were found in 11 enterococcal species, including enterococcus avium, enterococcus casseliflavus, enterococcus dispar, enterococcus durans, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus gallinarum, enterococcus hirae, enterococcus malodoratus, enterococcus mundtii, enterococcus pseudoavium, and enterococcus raffinosus. for  the other six enterococcal species (enterococcus cecorum, enterococcus columbae,  enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus sulfureus, enterococcus saccharolyticus, and  enterococcus solitarius), only the tufa gene was present. based on 16s rrna gene  sequence analysis, the 11 species having two tuf genes all have a common ancestor, while the six species having only one copy diverged from the enterococcal lineage before that common ancestor. the presence of one or two copies of the tuf gene in enterococci was confirmed by southern hybridization. phylogenetic analysis of tuf sequences demonstrated that the enterococcal tufa gene branches with the bacillus, listeria, and staphylococcus genera, while the enterococcal tufb gene clusters with the genera streptococcus and lactococcus. primary structure analysis showed that four amino acid residues encoded within the sequenced regions are conserved and unique to the enterococcal tufb genes and the tuf genes of streptococci and lactococcus lactis. the data suggest that an ancestral streptococcus or a streptococcus-related species may have horizontally  transferred a tuf gene to the common ancestor of the 11 enterococcal species which now carry two tuf genes.

TI  == random amplification of polymorphic dna versus pulsed field gel electrophoresis of smai dna macrorestriction fragments for typing strains of vancomycin-resistant enterococci.
AB  == genetic typing of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) can be performed using a variety of methods, but comparative analyses of the quality of these methods are  still relatively scarce. we here compare random amplification of polymorphic dna  (rapd) analysis with pulsed field gel electrophoresis (pfge) of dna macrorestriction fragments as examples of two of the recent and well-accepted molecular typing methods. for the latter method, empirical guidelines for the interpretation of the dna fingerprints have been proposed in the international literature. based on our experimental analyses, we define similar criteria for rapd fingerprinting. a collection of 100 strains of vre, comprising enterococcus  faecium, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus avium, enterococcus gallinarum and enterococcus casseliflavus, was assembled. fifty isolates were dutch, another 50  were isolated in the uk. strains were selected on the basis of previously determined putative identity, close relatedness or uniqueness. the strains were analysed using well-standardised rapd and pfge protocols. resulting fingerprints  were interpreted with computerised methods involving band positioning and we show that typing of vre by pfge and rapd generates highly congruent dna fingerprint clustering. when the proposed international criteria for interpretation of pfge fingerprints were applied in our case, 86% pfge homology as discriminating value  between close relatedness and uniqueness, a 75% homology cut-off for the comparison of the rapd-generated dna fingerprints revealed essentially identical  strain clusters. as a spin-off it is revealed that strains from the different species can be efficiently discriminated, that strains from the uk and the netherlands form separate clusters and that strains from veterinary origin can be identified separately as well.

AB  == a study was undertaken to develop an easy-to-use and cost-effective algorithm for the detection and identification of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) in surveillance cultures, because the incidence of vre outbreaks in institutions across canada has made continuous surveillance a necessity. enterococcus faecium  and enterococcus faecalis carry transferable resistance genes and hence are a problem for infection control. in laboratory surveillance, however, enterococcus  gallinarum and enterococcus casseliflavus, which exhibit low-level nontransferable resistance, are also encountered and often create confusion in identification. included in this study were a total of 218 strains of enterococci and other streptococci isolated from surveillance cultures. conventional methods  were used to determine their biochemical activities, and speciation was attempted in 121 strains using a rapid multiplex polymerase chain reaction (pcr) method that utilized primers for the vana, b, c1, c2/c3 and ddl genes. the results indicated that by using only a few tests (gram stain, pyrrolidonyl arylamidase activity, motility, xylose and methyl-alpha-d-glucopyranoside utilization), enterococcus faecium/faecalis strains could be accurately differentiated from enterococcus gallinarum/casseliflavus strains. for the 121 strains on which pcr was performed, there was a 100% correlation with the biochemical identification,  with the added advantage that the presence of van genes could be determined at the same time. the cost of identification using minimal biochemical testing and pcr was less than that of identification using automated systems or a battery of  conventional biochemical methods. the algorithm presented here may be used in the microbiology laboratory.

TI  == susceptibility to quinupristin/dalfopristin and other antibiotics of vancomycin-resistant enterococci from the uk, 1997 to mid-1999.
AB  == susceptibility to quinupristin/dalfopristin and other antibiotics was studied for clinical isolates of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) referred by uk hospitals between january 1997 and june 1999. single isolates of vre from 858 patients in 136 hospitals were received, of which 76% were enterococcus faecium and 21% were enterococcus faecalis, the remainder comprising minor species. most  isolates were multi-resistant. after allowing for the effect of blood, which raised the mics of quinupristin/dalfopristin four-fold, 98.3% of e. faecalis isolates and all the enterococcus avium, enterococcus casseliflavus and enterococcus gallinarum appeared resistant to quinupristin/dalfopristin, whereas  98.8% of the e. faecium isolates and the single enterococcus raffinosus isolate were susceptible.

TI  == evaluation of a new system, vitek 2, for identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of enterococci.
AB  == we evaluated the new automated vitek 2 system (biomerieux) for the identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of enterococci. the results obtained with the vitek 2 system were compared to those obtained by reference methods: standard identification by the scheme of facklam and sahm [r. r. facklam and d. f. sahm, p. 308-314, in p. r. murray et al., ed., manual of clinical microbiology, 6th ed., 1995] and with the api 20 strep system and, for antimicrobial susceptibility testing, broth microdilution and agar dilution methods by the procedures of the national committee for clinical laboratory standards. the presence of vana and vanb genes was determined by pcr. a total of  150 clinical isolates were studied, corresponding to 60 enterococcus faecalis, 55 enterococcus faecium, 26 enterococcus gallinarum, 5 enterococcus avium, 2 enterococcus durans, and 2 enterococcus raffinosus isolates. among those isolates, 131 (87%) were correctly identified to the species level with the vitek 2 system. approximately half of the misidentifications were for e. faecium with low-level resistance to vancomycin, identified as e. gallinarum or e. casseliflavus; however, a motility test solved the discrepancies and increased the agreement to 94%. among the strains studied, 66% were vancomycin resistant (57 vana, 16 vanb, and 26 vanc strains), 23% were ampicillin resistant (mics, >/=16 microgram/ml), 31% were high-level gentamicin resistant, and 45% were high-level streptomycin resistant. percentages of agreement for susceptibility and resistance to ampicillin, vancomycin, and teicoplanin and for high-level gentamicin resistance and high-level streptomycin resistance were 93, 95, 97, 97, and 96%, respectively. the accuracy of identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of enterococci with the vitek 2 system, together with the  significant reduction in handling time, will have a positive impact on the work flow of the clinical microbiology laboratory.

TI  == enterococcal-type glycopeptide resistance genes in non-enterococcal organisms.
AB  == although the emergence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci can be attributed, in  part, to the increasing use of vancomycin in clinical practice, and glycopeptide  use in animal husbandry, the origins of the enterococcal vancomycin resistance genes are not clear. the vancomycin resistance-associated genes in enterococcus gallinarum, enterococcus casseliflavus/flavescens, lactobacillus spp., leuconostoc spp., pediococcus spp., and erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, are not the source of the high-level vancomycin resistance-associated genes in enterococci. there are, however, environmental organisms which have been found to have gene clusters homologous to the enterococcal vana, vanb and vanc gene clusters; these  include the biopesticide paenibacillus popilliae, and, to a lesser extent, the glycopeptide-producing organisms amycolatopsis orientalis and streptomyces toyocaensis. still, the exact sources of the enterococcal vancomycin resistance genes remain a mystery.

TI  == comparison of phenotypic methods to identify enterococci intrinsically resistant  to vancomycin (vanc vre).
AB  == clinical laboratories must be able to differentiate between enterococci possessing acquired resistance to vancomycin (vana and vanb genotypes) from those that are inherently resistant (vanc1 and vanc2/c3 genotypes). we compared several routine phenotypic tests to determine the species identity of clinical isolates of enterococci and a pcr assay for the van ligase genes was used to confirm identification of vanc vre. the vitek gram positive identification card identified 53/60 (88%) enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium isolates and 81/141 (57%) vanc vre without additional testing. another 32 of the vanc vre required additional testing (e.g., motility and pigmentation) for correct identification.  however, 7 of these 32 vanc vre were nonmotile. the rapid id 32 strep strips identified 50/60 (83%) e. faecalis and e. faecium isolates and 102/141 (72%) vanc vre. all e. faecalis and e. faecium isolates were nonmotile and did not acidify 1% methyl-alpha-d-glucopyranoside (mgp). only 93/115 (81%) e. gallinarum and 21/26 (81%) e. casseliflavus/e. flavescens were motile but all 141 vanc vre acidified mgp. mgp acidification can accurately differentiate vanc vre from e. faecalis and e. faecium. because some vanc vre isolates are nonmotile, mgp acidification is preferred as a simple and less costly test for identification of these isolates.

TI  == prevalence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci in fecal samples from hospitalized patients and nonhospitalized controls in a cattle-rearing area of france.
AB  == vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) have emerged as nosocomial pathogens over  the last decade, but little is known about their epidemiology. we report on the prevalence of vre fecal colonization on the basis of a prospective study among patients hospitalized in a hematology intensive care unit and among nonhospitalized subjects living in the local community. a total of 243 rectal swabs from hematology patients and 169 stool samples from the control group were  inoculated onto bile-esculin agar plates with and without 6 mg of vancomycin per  liter and into an enrichment bile-esculin broth supplemented with 4 mg of vancomycin per liter. a total of 37% of the hospitalized patients and 11.8% of the subjects from the community were found to be vre carriers. a total of 65 vre  strains were isolated: 12 (18.5%) e. faecium, 46 (70.7%) e. gallinarum, and 7 (10.8%) e. casseliflavus strains. no e. faecalis strains were detected. all the e. faecium strains were of the vana genotype. molecular typing by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis revealed a different pattern for each vana vre strain that originated from an individual subject. to our knowledge, this is the first study  to be carried out in a cattle-rearing region of france. it reports a higher vre prevalence than that reported in previous european or u.s. studies. a partial explanation is the use of an enrichment broth step which enabled detection of strains which would otherwise have been missed, but the fact that subjects and patients were recruited from a predominantly agricultural area where vancomycin-related antibiotics have recently been used in animal husbandry could  also contribute to the high levels of vre in patients and subjects alike.

AB  == simple pcr and sequencing assays that utilize a single pair of degenerate primers were used to characterize a 438-bp-long dna fragment internal (soda(int)) to the  soda gene encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase in 19 enterococcal type strains (enterococcus avium, enterococcus casseliflavus, enterococcus cecorum, enterococcus columbae, enterococcus dispar, enterococcus durans, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus flavescens, enterococcus gallinarum, enterococcus hirae, enterococcus malodoratus, enterococcus mundtii, enterococcus pseudoavium, enterococcus raffinosus, enterococcus saccharolyticus, enterococcus seriolicida, enterococcus solitarius,  and enterococcus sulfureus). sequence analysis of the soda(int) fragments enabled reliable identification of 18 enterococcal species, including e. casseliflavus-e. flavescens and e. gallinarum. the soda(int) fragments of e. casseliflavus and e.  flavescens were almost identical (99.5% sequence identity), which suggests that they should be associated in a single species. our results confirm that the soda  gene constitutes a more discriminative target sequence than 16s rrna gene in differentiating closely related bacterial species.

AB  == the molecular epidemiology of glycopeptide-resistant enterococci (gre) colonizing the intestinal tracts of belgian renal dialysis patients was studied among 1318 patients of a population of 1800 dialysis patients from 29 dialysis centers. of these, 185 patients (14.0%) were colonized with a vana-positive gre; gre harboring the vanb gene were not detected. the majority of the vana gre (80.5%) were identified as enterococcus faecium; 14.8% were identified as e. faecalis; and a limited number were identified as e. avium, e. casseliflavus, e. dispar, e. durans, or e. gallinarum. genome analysis of 277 vana-positive gre by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis revealed a high genetic variability both within  the different dialysis centers and within the patients' own gre flora. no high-level gentamicin-resistant vana-positive gre were detected, and most strains remained susceptible to ampicillin. these findings do not support a hospital-driven endemicity of vana-positive enterococcal isolates in belgium.

TI  == characterization of 'faecal streptococci' as indicators of faecal pollution and distribution in the environment.
AB  == the recent revision of the taxonomy of 'faecal streptococci' prompted us to verify the importance of identifying the species of this group of cocci. during a study carried out to assess the hygienic quality of environmental samples from a  variety of sources, we isolated 198 strains named faecal streptococci on the basis of conventional international tests (eva broth multiple tube test) used for public health purposes. the predominant species were enterococcus faecalis (39%)  and ent. faecium (29%), followed by ent. durans/hirae, ent. casseliflavus/gallinarum, ent. raffinosus, with a different prevalence of the species depending on the source. eighty-four per cent of isolates were true faecal species. only one isolate was identified as belonging to the streptococcus genus. the authors stress the opportunity to identify the species. this may help  to clarify the ecological and epidemiological characteristics of intestinal enterococci and streptococci in the environment, in drinking and recreational waters and their meaning as indicators of faecal pollution. all isolates were tested for their susceptibility to some antimicrobial agents widely used in medical therapy and the pattern was compared with the pattern of isolates from clinical specimens.

AB  == we isolated 1487 enterococcus species from 1200 stool specimens collected from high-risk patients in 12 canadian tertiary care hospitals between october 1995 and november 1996. the composition of the 1487 isolates was 601 vancomycin-sensitive enterococcus faecalis (40.4%), 667 vancomycin-sensitive enterococcus faecium (44.9%), 18 vancomycin-resistant (nine isolates mic 8-16 micrograms/ml; nine isolates mic > or = 32 micrograms/ml) e. faecium (vref) (1.2%), 95 vancomycin-sensitive enterococcus gallinarum (6.4%), 29 vancomycin-resistant (all mics 8-16 micrograms/ml) e. gallinarum (2.0%), and 77 vancomycin-sensitive enterococcus casseliflavus (5.2%). nine of the 18 vref isolates collected possessed the vana genotype and were from three patients at one hospital. two other vref isolates, of the vanb genotype, were from a single patient at a second hospital, and the remaining seven isolates, also all of the vanb genotype, were from five patients at a third hospital. all vref were ampicillin resistant (mic > or = 16 micrograms/ml), streptomycin resistant (mic > 1000 micrograms/ml), and ciprofloxacin resistant (mic > or = 4 micrograms/ml). ten of the 18 vref were also resistant to gentamicin (mic > 500 micrograms/ml), while all 18 isolates had quinupristin/dalfopristin mics < or = 0.5 microgram/ml. in conclusion, high-risk patients in tertiary care canadian hospitals are rarely  colonized (9/1200 patients, 0.75%) with vref in their lower gastrointestinal tract. these findings correlate well with the lack of reported vref infection in  high-risk patients in canadian hospitals. quinupristin/dalfopristin demonstrated  excellent in vitro activity against vref and other non-faecalis species of enterococcus, many of which also possessed high-level ampicillin, and/or high-level aminoglycoside, and/or ciprofloxacin resistance.

TI  == development of a pcr assay for rapid detection of enterococci.
AB  == enterococci are becoming major nosocomial pathogens, and increasing resistance to vancomycin has been well documented. conventional identification methods, which are based on culturing, require 2 to 3 days to provide results. pcr has provided  a means for the culture-independent detection of enterococci in a variety of clinical specimens and is capable of yielding results in just a few hours. however, all pcr-based assays developed so far are species specific only for clinically important enterococci. we have developed a pcr-based assay which allows the detection of enterococci at the genus level by targeting the tuf gene, which encodes elongation factor ef-tu. initially, we compared the nucleotide sequences of the tuf gene from several bacterial species (available in public databases) and designed degenerate pcr primers derived from conserved regions. these primers were used to amplify a target region of 803 bp from four enterococcal species (enterococcus avium, e. faecalis, e. faecium, and e. gallinarum). subsequently, the complete nucleotide sequences of these amplicons were determined. the analysis of a multiple alignment of these sequences revealed regions conserved among enterococci but distinct from those of other bacteria. pcr primers complementary to these regions allowed amplification of genomic dnas  from 14 of 15 species of enterococci tested (e. solitarius dna could not be amplified). there was no amplification with a majority of 79 nonenterococcal bacterial species, except for 2 abiotrophia species and several listeria species. furthermore, this assay efficiently amplified all 159 clinical isolates of enterococci tested (61 e. faecium, 77 e. faecalis, 9 e. gallinarum, and 12 e. casseliflavus isolates). interestingly, the preliminary sequence comparison of the amplicons for four enterococcal species demonstrated that there were some sequence variations which may be used to generate species-specific internal probes. in conclusion, this rapid pcr-based assay is capable of detecting all clinically important enterococci and has potential for use in clinical microbiology laboratories.

(25%) and 107 strains (17%) isolated from slanetz-bartley agar were not enterococci. we found that the non-enterococcal group consisted of other gram-positive cocci and gram-positive and gram-negative rods. based on the identification we tried to find a relation between taxonomic position of isolated strains and their colony morphology on slanetz-bartley agar. our of the total of 523 identified enterococci, 345 strains (66%) formed purple colonies, 136 red colonies (26%), 37 pink colonies (7%) and 5 cream colored colonies (1%). there was no correlation among the color, size or colony morphology and the taxonomic characterization of enterococcal strains.

TI  == practical approach to the identification of clinically relevant enterococcus species.
AB  == enterococci have become important nosocomial pathogens, with enterococcus faecalis and then enterococcus faecium predominating. because of the emergence of glycopeptide (vancomycin and teicoplanin) resistance in enterococci, laboratories have been required to screen for resistant strains and to identify them to the species level. this has resulted in the need for accurate identification of species less commonly associated with clinical infections, such as enterococcus casseliflavus and enterococcus gallinarum, which are inherently resistant to the  glycopeptides. studies evaluating commonly used commercial identification systems, have found error rates for enterococcal species identification of 2-21%  for e. faecalis, 5-9% for e. faecium, and 14-79% for other species. reporting errors may have adverse effects on the management of clinical infections, as well as in the control of multidrug-resistant strain outbreaks. the purpose of this document is to present a simplified approach to the identification of enterococcus species that uses a combination of rapid, readily available, and inexpensive tests.

AB  == the results of prevalence studies on glycopeptide-resistant enterococci (gre) in  the intestine may be influenced by the detection methods applied. in most studies different media, different concentrations of antibiotics, and different methods are used, and these differences result in differences in recovery rates. in this  cross-sectional study on the carrier state of gre among patients at the university hospital antwerp, antwerp, belgium, performed on 21 may 1996, direct plating and broth enrichment were compared by using the same media. stool samples (n = 213) or rectal swabs (n = 122) were plated directly on enterococcosel agar (biomerieux) and after enrichment in enterococcosel broth. the prevalence of gre  was 12.8%. direct plating recovered 53.4% of the gre isolates, and broth enrichment recovered an additional 46.5% of them; in the latter test the isolates were thus present at less than 10(3) cfu per g of feces. the prevalence of gre among dialysis patients was higher than among the other patients, but the difference was not significant (p = 0.06), possibly as a result of the small numbers of dialysis patients examined. the gre species isolated included 19 e. gallinarum (44.2%), 13 e. faecium (30.2%), 6 e. faecalis (13.9%), and 5 e. casseliflavus (11.6%) isolates. all e. faecalis and e. faecium strains isolated carried the vana gene, and e. gallinarum and e. casseliflavus carried the vanc1 and vanc2 gene, respectively. the majority of isolates were polyclonal. our data  indicate that the rate of detection of gre from both stool samples and rectal swabs is significantly increased with enrichment cultures.

AB  == three different methodologies, reduction of litmus milk (lm) and acidification of arabinose (ara), acidification of methyl-alpha-d-glucopyranoside (mgp), and rapid motility (rm), for differentiating isolates of enterococcus casseliflavus and enterococcus gallinarum (intrinsically vancomycin-resistant enterococci [ivre]) from enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium were evaluated. all 33 isolates of e. faecalis tested reduced lm within 4 h and were negative in all other tests, while the 53 isolates of e. faecium were ara positive only. in contrast, 45 of 46 (98%) ivre isolates examined (26 e. casseliflavus and 20 e. gallinarum isolates) acidified mgp, 41 of 46 (89%) were lm and ara positive, and  45 of 46 (98%) were rm positive. acidification of mgp was therefore the single most useful test for differentiating ivre from vancomycin-resistant e. faecium and e. faecalis; however, a combination of lm-ara and rm testing enabled the correct designation of organisms without the need for overnight incubation.

AB  == the motile enterococci with the vanc gene have intrinsic low-level resistance to  vancomycin, but have not been implicated in a nosocomial outbreak. we determined  the colonization rate of motile enterococci in hospitalized and nonhospitalized patients. perianal or stool specimens were cultured in enterococcosel broth supplemented with 6 micrograms of vancomycin per ml. rapid motility and pigment tests were performed on all enterococci isolated. a total of 82 motile and/or pigmented enterococci were isolated from 679 patients for a colonization rate of  12.1%. there were 43 enterococcus gallinarum, 32 enterococcus casseliflavus, 4 enterococcus flavescens, and 3 enterococcus mundtii identified. the e. gallinarum vancomycin mic90 was 32 micrograms/ml and the e. casseliflavus vancomycin mic90 was 8 micrograms/ml.

TI  == detection and differentiation of vanc-1, vanc-2, and vanc-3 glycopeptide resistance genes in enterococci.
AB  == the vanc phenotype, as found in enterococcus gallinarum, e. casseliflavus, and e. flavescens, is characterized by intrinsic low-level resistance to vancomycin. the nucleotide sequences of the vanc-1 gene in e. gallinarum, the vanc-2 gene in e. casseliflavus, and the vanc-3 gene in e. flavescens have been reported, although  there is some disagreement as to whether e. flavescens is a legitimate enterococcal species. previous attempts to differentiate the vanc-2 and vanc-3 genes by pcr analysis have been unsuccessful. the purpose of the present study was to detect and differentiate the three vanc determinants and examine the distribution of these genes in a collection of both typical and atypical enterococci. the 796-bp vanc-1 pcr product was amplified only from e. gallinarum  isolates. as expected, due to the extensive homology in the vanc-2 and vanc-3 gene sequences, all of the e. casseliflavus and e. casseliflavus/flavescens isolates produced the 484-bp vanc-2 pcr product, although the e. gallinarum isolates were negative. only the e. casseliflavus/flavescens isolates produced the 224-bp vanc-3 product. using the three sets of primers, we were able to detect and distinguish the vanc-1, vanc-2, and vanc-3 genes from both typical and atypical enterococci strains. antimicrobial susceptibility tests and analysis of  genomic dna by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis were also performed, but the results indicated that they were not able to distinguish among strains possessing the three vanc genotypes.

TI  == effects of different test conditions on mics of food animal growth-promoting antibacterial agents for enterococci.
AB  == the influence of the addition of sheep blood to mueller-hinton ii agar and the effects of aerobic incubation with or without co2 and of anaerobic incubation were tested with bacitracin, tylosin, avoparcin, virginiamycin, avilamycin, narasin, and flavomycin on enterococci. the antibacterial activity of bambermycin (flavomycin) was strongly inhibited by the addition of blood, except with the species enterococcus faecium, enterococcus mundtii, enterococcus hirae, enterococcus casseliflavus, and enterococcus gallinarum, which were not susceptible to this antibiotic on blood-free medium. with all other antimicrobials except avoparcin and tylosin, the presence of blood resulted in mic increases of 1 to 3 log2 differences. incubation in aerobic or anaerobic atmospheres enriched with co2 lowered the susceptibility of enterococci to tylosin and increased their susceptibility to avilamycin, narasin, and avoparcin. this effect was most pronounced in tests on blood-free media. results of susceptibility tests incubated under anaerobiosis and in a co2-enriched atmosphere did not differ. for all enterococcal species, the preferred conditions for testing the susceptibility are mueller-hinton ii medium supplemented with blood and incubation in a co2-enriched atmosphere. however, when only e. faecium  and enterococcus faecalis are being tested, mueller-hinton ii medium without blood incubated aerobically gives satisfactory results.

TI  == identification of clinically important species of enterococcus within 1 day with  randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd).
AB  == the use of randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) for rapid, reliable, and easily interpreted identification of enterococci was evaluated. nineteen type strains of enterococcus, 12 reference strains, and 114 clinical isolates of enterococcus were analyzed. discrimination was obtained between most type strains, the exceptions being ent. casseliflavus and ent. flavescens, which had relatively similar rapd-profiles. ent. faecalis and ent. faecium were readily separated, and ent. gallinarum and ent. durans could also be identified. extracts to be used in the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) were prepared directly from agar plate colonies, which made it possible to complete the identification procedure in one day. rapd was proved to be a fast and reliable method for identification of most enterococcus spp. of clinical significance.

TI  == comparative in vitro and bactericidal activity of oxazolidinone antibiotics against multidrug-resistant enterococci.
AB  == increasing resistance among enterococci poses a considerable therapeutic problem. in this study, we evaluated the comparative in vitro activity of two investigational oxazolidinone antibiotics, eperezolid and linezolid, versus clinical isolates of multidrug-resistant enterococci. one hundred isolates (16 enterococcus faecalis, 69 e. faecium, 10 e. gallinarum, 2 e. casseliflavus, 1 e.  avium, 1 e. hirae, and 1 e. raffinosus) evaluated were collected from diverse geographic areas in north america and europe from 1991 to 1995. eperezolid mic50  and mic90 were 1.0 microgram/ml and 2.0 micrograms/ml (1.0-2.0 micrograms/ml range). linezolid mic50 and mic90 were 2.0 micrograms/ml and 2.0 micrograms/ml (0.5-2.0 micrograms/ml range), respectively. mics were the same at 10(3) cfu/ml and 10(8) cfu/ml initial inoculum. in time-kill experiments using 10 strains and  concentrations of 4 micrograms/ml, 8 micrograms/ml, and 16 micrograms/ml (achievable serum concentrations) of eperezolid and linezolid there was a 2 log10 reduction of growth for 2 of 10 isolates tested using eperezolid and a 1 log10 reduction for 50% of isolates with both agents. there was indifferent bactericidal killing when either oxazolidinone was combined with gentamicin, ampicillin, or streptomycin for isolates lacking these resistances. this study demonstrates these oxazolidinone agents to have excellent in vitro activity versus multidrug-resistant enterococci.

TI  == comparison of agar dilution, broth microdilution, e-test, disk diffusion, and automated vitek methods for testing susceptibilities of enterococcus spp. to vancomycin.
AB  == an evaluation was undertaken to determine the optimal method for testing the susceptibilities of 100 clinical isolates and two reference strains of enterococcus spp. to vancomycin in vitro. six testing methods were studied by using the following media and incubation times: agar screen with the synergy quad plate (remel, lenexa, kans.), an in-house-prepared brain heart infusion (bhi) agar plate, and an in-house-prepared mueller-hinton (mh) agar plate, all incubated for 24 or 48 h; broth microdilution (sensititre just one strip; accumed international, inc., west lake, ohio) with bhi or cation-adjusted mh broth incubated for 24 or 48 h; agar dilution with bhi or mh agar incubated for 24 or 48 h; epsilometer test (e test; ab biodisk, solna, sweden) with bhi or mh agar incubated for 24 or 48 h; disk diffusion with bhi or mh agar incubated for 24 or  48 h; and the automated vitek method with the gram-positive susceptibility staphylococcus aureus card and r02.03 software (biomerieux, inc., hazelwood, mo.). growth failures occurred with mh media (n = 6) but not with bhi media. one  growth failure occurred with the vitek method. results for each testing method for each enterococcus strain were interpreted as susceptible, intermediate, or resistant according to current national committee for clinical laboratory standards (nccls) criteria and compared to the vancomycin resistance genotype (i.e., vana, vanb, vanc-1, or vanc-2/3). for all methods, extension of the incubation time from 24 h to 48 h either produced no difference in the results or gave poorer results. the following methods produced no very major or major interpretive errors: broth microdilution with bhi media incubated for 24 h, agar  dilution with bhi media incubated for 24 or 48 h, and e test with bhi media incubated for 24 or 48 h. unacceptable frequencies of very major errors (> 1%) occurred with all methods for which mh media were used. minor interpretive errors were frequent with all methods. these minor interpretive errors also occurred most frequently with enterococcus strains with vanc genes, which encoded low-level vancomycin resistance (mic < or = 8 microg/ml), as opposed to enterococcus strains which possessed vana or vanb genes, which encoded higher-level vancomycin resistance (mic > or = 64 microg/ml). modification of nccls breakpoints, especially for motile enterococcus spp. (e. casseliflavus, e.  flavescens, and e. gallinarum), may resolve this problem; however, in the current study, one e. faecalis strain and one e. faecium strain carried only the vanc gene. the agar screen method may also require reformulation. the current agar screen plate contains 6 microg of vancomycin per ml, which may not detect all low-level resistance associated with vanc genotypes. nevertheless, the clinical significance of this low-level vancomycin resistance remains unknown.

TI  == effect of vancomycin on intestinal flora of patients who previously received antimicrobial therapy.
AB  == to evaluate the ecological disturbances of peroral vancomycin administration following cephalosporin administration, 20 healthy volunteers received cefuroxime axetil tablets (250 mg) perorally twice a day for 1 week, and 10 of these volunteers subsequently received vancomycin capsules (125 mg) perorally four times daily for 7 days. the concentration of vancomycin in feces after 1 week of  vancomycin administration was high (mean +/- sd, 520 +/- 197 mg/kg), which correlated with the ecological disturbances noted in the vancomycin recipients. vancomycin administration resulted in a rapid decrease in the numbers of intestinal enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, and enterococcus durans (p < or = .05), while there was a significant emergence of motile enterococci with decreased susceptibility to vancomycin (enterococcus gallinarum and enterococcus casseliflavus; minimum inhibitory concentration, 4-16 mg/l) (p < or  = .01). because of vancomycin administration, there was also a significant overgrowth of vancomycin-resistant pediococcus species and lactobacilli as well as of klebsiella species, citrobacter species, and enterobacter species (p < or = .01). the numbers of bifidobacteria and bacteroides species were significantly reduced during vancomycin administration. none of the enterococcal strains carried vana or vanb. twenty-two of the 27 motile enterococci carried the vanc-1  gene specific for e. gallinarum, whereas five strains carried the vanc-2(c-3) gene, thus implicating that they were e. casseliflavus or enterococcus flavescens.

TI  == bacterial resistance to vancomycin: overproduction, purification, and characterization of vanc2 from enterococcus casseliflavus as a d-ala-d-ser ligase.
AB  == the vanc phenotype for clinical resistance of enterococci to vancomycin is exhibited by enterococcus gallinarum and enterococcus casseliflavus. based on the detection of the cell precursor udp-n-acetylmuramic acid pentapeptide intermediate terminating in d-ala-d-ser instead of d-ala-d-ala, it has been predicted that the vanc ligase would be a d-ala-d-ser rather than a d-ala-d-ala ligase. overproduction of the e. casseliflavus atcc 25788 vanc2 gene in escherichia coli and its purification to homogeneity allowed demonstration of atp-dependent d-ala-d-ser ligase activity. the kcat/km2 (km2 = km for d-ser or c-terminal d-ala) ratio for d-ala-d-ser/d-ala-d-ala dipeptide formation is 270/0.69 for a 400-fold selection against d-ala in the c-terminal position. vanc2 also has substantial d-ala-d-asn ligase activity (kcat/km2 = 74 mm-1min-1).

TI  == rapid characterization schemes for surveillance isolates of vancomycin-resistant  enterococci.
AB  == surveillance cultures for vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) and subsequent characterization of the isolates can be extremely burdensome and difficult. therefore, efficient and reliable schemes for the characterization of surveillance isolates are needed. in this study, a commercial agar (bile esculin  azide agar with 6 microg of vancomycin per ml [beaa]; remel, lenexa, kans.) was used in the initial screening step to establish relatively rapid (i.e., in < or = 24 h from the time of isolation) phenotype-based and pcr-based schemes for the detection and characterization of vre. the phenotype-based scheme included gram staining of growth on beaa and subculture of cocci on sheep blood agar plates for vancomycin disk diffusion and pyrazinamidase (pyr) testing. for the pcr scheme, inocula for van gene detection were taken directly from the beaa plates. the phenotypic approach was applied to 378 surveillance cultures that yielded growth  on beaa. gram staining quickly eliminated gram-positive bacilli from further testing, and a negative pyr test classified 25 additional isolates as probable pediococci. a positive pyr test reliably identified 121 single-patient vre isolates that included 83 enterococcus faecium, 33 e. gallinarum, and 5 e. casseliflavus strains. the vancomycin inhibition zone size clearly distinguished  vana and vanb strains from vanc strains within 24 h of beaa isolation. all vana and vanb strains failed to produce zones of >6 mm, while only one vanc strain produced a zone of < 15 mm. challenging this phenotypic scheme with 47 stock vre  isolates produced similar findings. in direct pcr analyses, false-negative vana and vanb results occurred with 12% of the specimens. many of the false-negative reactions also failed to produce an internal control product, which underscores the need for including control primers when a pcr scheme is used. in summary, the phenotype- and the pcr-based schemes provide efficient methods for characterizing vre within 24 h of isolation.

TI  == surveillance for antimicrobial resistance in enterococci.
AB  == aim: to describe antimicrobial resistance patterns of enterococcus species in auckland. background: antimicrobial resistant enterococci have emerged as major nosocomial pathogens in overseas hospitals. it is recommended that hospitals perform periodic surveys to determine local enterococcal resistance patterns. methods: enterococcal isolates from four patient groups were tested: group i were recovered from routine clinical specimens; group ii were stool isolates from patients at risk of having vancomycin resistant enterococci, eg, intensive care unit patients, patients receiving vancomycin, and immunocompromised patients receiving antibiotics; group iii were enterococci from stool specimens sent for clostridium difficile toxin testing; group iv were isolates from stool specimens  submitted to a community laboratory for enteric pathogen testing. all enterococci isolated were tested for the presence of beta-lactamase, susceptibility to amoxycillin, teicoplanin, vancomycin, and for high level gentamicin and streptomycin resistance. results: there were 121 group i enterococcal isolates. 628 stool specimens were cultured. enterococci were isolated from: 76/148 (51%) group ii specimens; 166/279 (60%) group iii specimens; and 70/201 (35%) of group  iv specimens. antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed on 433 isolates; 74% were e faecalis, 12% e faecium, 6% e gallinarum/casseliflavus group and 8% other enterococcal species. no isolate produced beta-lactamase. all e faecalis were susceptible to amoxycillin. two e faecium and one enterococcus species were  resistant to amoxycillin (mics all 16 mg/l). all isolates were susceptible to teicoplanin. fourteen e gallinarum/casseliflavus group isolates had intermediate  susceptibility to vancomycin (mics of 8 mg/l). one e faecium had intermediate susceptibility to vancomycin (mic 8 mg/l). high level gentamicin and streptomycin resistance occurred in 64 (15%) and 50 (12%) isolates respectively. conclusion: vancomycin resistance is rare and is essentially restricted to species that are rarely clinical pathogens, i.e., e casseliflavus and e gallinarum. our results have established the local susceptibility profile for enterococcal isolates. this allows comparison with other locations and the detection of emerging trends of resistance.

TI  == species identification of enterococci via intergenic ribosomal pcr.
AB  == accurate species identification of enterococci has become important with the wide prevalence of acquired vancomycin resistance and the presence of less epidemiologically important, inherently vancomycin-resistant enterococci. using a collection of enterococcal strains, we found that pcr amplification of the intergenic spacer (its-pcr) between the 16s and 23s rrna genes can produce amplicon profiles characteristic of the enterococcus examined. the species examined were group i enterococci (enterococcus avium, enterococcus raffinosus, enterococcus malodoratus, and enterococcus pseudoavium), group ii enterococci (enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus casseliflavus, enterococcus mundtii, and enterococcus gallinarum), and group iii enterococci (enterococcus durans and enterococcus hirae). the enterococcal species in group i, as well as e. faecalis and two strains of e. hirae, were similar and therefore had to be differentiated from each other by sau3a restriction digests. this produced patterns characteristic of each of these species. the remaining group ii and group iii enterococcal species produced amplicons characteristic of a particular species except e. gallinarum. the pcr products from e. gallinarum displayed strain-to-strain heterogeneity in the number and size of amplicons. to  further test the utility of this technique, 11 phenotypically aberrant strains which had been assigned species identification based on facklam and collins-type  strain reactions (r.r. facklam and m.d. collins, j. clin. microbiol. 27:731-734,  1989) were subjected to its-pcr. its-pcr of the phenotypically aberrant strains identified six strains with reactions consistent with those of type strains. however, five strains were characterized as follows: two strains originally identified as e. mundtii were identified by its-pcr as e. casseliflavus, one strain originally identified as e. raffinosus was identified by its-pcr as e. durans, one strain originally identified as e. hirae was identified by its-pcr as e. faecium [corrected]. we conclude that amplification of the intergenic 23s and  16s rrna gene regions of enterococci provides a reliable technique for species identification of enterococci.

AB  == objective: to evaluate the prevalence of fecal carriage of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) by patients hospitalized in intensive care units from 24 french general hospitals. methods: rectal swabs were obtained from 647 patients hospitalized in intensive care units during the month of june 1994 and plated on  agar medium selective for vancomycin-resistant enterococci. the glycopeptide resistance phenotypes and genotypes of the enterococci detected were characterized. results: thirty-two of 647 patients (4.9%) carried vre. thirteen strains (2%) were identified as enterococcus faecium and 19 (2.9%) as enterococcus gallinarum or enterococcus casseliflavus. none of these strains was  highly resistant to gentamicin. the e. gallinarum and e. casseliflavus strains contained the vanc1 and vanc2 genes, respectively. the e. faecium strains were highly resistant to vancomycin and teicoplanin and carried the vana gene. no infection due to vre was observed during the study period. pulsed-field gel analysis of total dna following digestion with smai or kspi from 13 vana-type e.  faecium strains revealed intra- and inter-hospital strain heterogeneity. however, the finding of isolates with indistinguishable pulsed-field types within the same ward and in two medical centers suggests patient-to-patient transmission or a common source. four e. faecium strains were isolated within 48 h after admission  of patients. conclusions: these results indicate that vre form part of the normal flora of patients and that, despite the actual scarcity of infections due to vre, there is a potential risk for dissemination of these strains in french hospitals.

TI  == evaluation of arbitrarily primed pcr analysis and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of large genomic dna fragments for identification of enterococci  important in human medicine.
AB  == the increasing problems encountered with enterococcal nosocomial infections and the intrinsic and acquired resistance of the enterococci to different antimicrobial compounds highlight the need for a rapid identification technique.  enterococcus faecalis is readily identified by biochemical tests, but species differentiation within the enterococcus faecium and enterococcus gallinarum species groups is less well established. in the present study, 66 strains representing the most prevalent human enterococci were used to develop a pcr-based species-specific identification protocol. whole-cell protein analysis by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was used as a reference method for species identification. in addition, the genomic smai macro-restriction fragment distribution of all of the strains was examined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge). oligonucleotide d11344-primed pcr was as discriminative as whole-cell protein analysis and resulted in more easily interpreted band patterns. this pcr-based technique allowed identification of clinical isolates by visual examination of the dna profiles obtained. the inability of both methods to discriminate between enterococcus casseliflavus and  enterococcus flavescens brought into question the species status of e. flavescens. pfge did not result in species-discriminative dna bands or band patterns, but proved to be superior for interpretation of interstrain relationships.

AB  == vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) are increasingly isolated from clinical specimens. one hundred clinical isolates of enterococci (e. casseliflavus/e. flavescens [n = 10], e. faecalis [n = 34], e. faecium [n = 43], e. avium [n = 1], e. gallinarum [n = 11], and e. raffinosus [n = 1]) were examined for the presence of vana, vanb, vanc-1, and vanc-2/3 genes by a single multiplex pcr performed directly with colonies from blood agar plates. six previously characterized vre strains which carry either vana, vanb, vanc-1, or vanc-2 genes were used as controls. to discriminate among van genes, the pcr amplicons were digested with mspi and were electrophoresed on agarose gels. because of significant sequence homology between vanc-2 and vanc-3 genes, this assay is unable to discriminate these genes from each other; therefore, these are referred to as vanc-2/3 genes.  pcr products were detected in 63 of the 100 clinical isolates. the restriction fragment length patterns were consistent with vana for 10 strains, vanb for 30 strains, vanc-1 for 12 strains, vanc-2 for 6 strains, and vana and vanc-1 for 1 strain. the vancomycin mics for the isolates with restriction fragment length patterns consistent with vana and vanb were all > and = 64 micrograms/ml. the vancomycin mics for the isolates with restriction fragment length patterns consistent with vanc-1 or vanc-2 were 4 to 8 micrograms/ml. the vancomycin mics for the isolates from which no pcr amplicons were produced were 2 to 4 micrograms/ml. a pcr product was produced in four isolates (vancomycin mics, 4 to > 256 micrograms/ml) with restriction fragment length patterns differing from those for the control vana, vanb, vanc-1, and vanc-2 isolates. dna sequencing of  these amplicons revealed that two of the four isolates had nucleic acid sequences which were closely related to the published sequence for the vanb gene and two had nucleic acid sequences which were closely related to the published sequence for the vanc-2 and vanc-3 genes. multiplex pcr-restriction fragment length polymorphism appears to be a useful and convenient method for rapidly detecting and discriminating genotypes for vancomycin-resistant enterococcus spp. in the clinical laboratory. in instances in which unusual restriction fragment patterns  of pcr amplicons occur, dna sequencing can be performed to discriminate van genotypes.

AB  == enterococcus gallinarum and e. casseliflavus are difficult to differentiate from  other enterococci, particularly e.faecium. the former two species were found to produce acid from methyl-alpha-d-glucopyranoside in phenol red broth, while e.faecalis strains and strains of the e.faecium species group, including e.faecium, e.durans, e. hirae, and e.mundtii, failed to produce acid from this substrate.

TI  == semisynthetic glycopeptide antibiotics derived from ly264826 active against vancomycin-resistant enterococci.
AB  == certain derivatives of the glycopeptide antibiotic ly264826 with n-alkyl-linked substitutions on the epivancosamine sugar are active against glycopeptide-resistant enterococci. six compounds representing our most active series were evaluated for activity against antibiotic-resistant, gram-positive pathogens. for enterococcus faecium and e. faecalis resistant to both vancomycin  and teicoplanin, the mics of the six semisynthetic compounds for 90% of the strains tested were 1 to 4 micrograms/ml, compared with 2,048 micrograms/ml for vancomycin and 256 micrograms/ml for ly264826. for e. faecium and e. faecalis resistant to vancomycin but not teicoplanin, the mics were 0.016 to 1 micrograms/ml, compared with 64 to 1,024 micrograms/ml for vancomycin. the compounds were highly active against vancomycin-susceptible enterococci and against e. gallinarum and e. casseliflavus and showed some activity against isolates of highly vancomycin-resistant leuconostocs and pediococci. the mics for 90% of the strains of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus tested were typically 0.25 to 1 micrograms/ml, compared with 1 microgram/ml for vancomycin. against methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis mics ranged from 0.25 to 2 micrograms/ml, compared with 1 to 4 micrograms/ml for vancomycin and 4 to 16 micrograms/ml for teicoplanin. the spectrum of these new compounds included activity against teicoplanin-resistant, coagulase-negative staphylococci. the compounds exhibited exceptional potency against pathogenic streptococci, with mics of < or = 0.008 microgram/ml against streptococcus pneumoniae, including penicillin-resistant isolates. in in vivo studies with a mouse infection model, the median effective doses against a challenge by s. aureus, s. pneumoniae, or s. pyogenes were typically 4 to 20 times lower than those of vancomycin. overall, these new glycopeptides, such as ly307599 and ly333328, show promise for use as agents against resistant enterococci, methicillin-resistant s. aureus, and penicillin-resistant pneumococci.

TI  == the gene encoding for penicillin-binding protein 5 of enterococcus faecalis is useful for development of a species-specific dna probe.
AB  == recently, in escherichia coli was cloned a sau3ai 3.4-kb fragment containing the  gene encoding for penicillin-binding protein 5 (pbp5) of enterococcus faecalis. the structural gene for the pbp of e. faecalis and the flanking regions were entirely sequenced (c. signoretto, m. boaretti, and p. canepari, fems microbiol.  lett. 123:99-106, 1994). when the entire cloned e. faecalis dna insert, labeled with digoxigenin, was used as a probe to detect a homology gene in enterococci, it was observed that only dnas of all the e. faecalis strains reacted to the probe. the same results were obtained when a hindiii fragment of 0.35 kb from the entire insert of 3.4 kb was used. in this study we tested a total of 62 clinically isolated enterococcal strains, belonging to the species e. faecalis (36 strains), e. faecium (13), e. gallinarum (6), e. bovis (2) e. avium (3), e. hirae (1), and e. casseliflavus (1). the results indicate that both the entire segment and the hindiii fragment may be useful for preparing a species-specific probe for rapid identification of e. faecalis species.

TI  == species identification and antibiotic susceptibility of enterococci isolated from clinical specimens of hospitalized patients.
AB  == over a 4-month period, a total of 315 enterococci were isolated from various clinical specimens of hospitalized patients. by applying an array of biochemical  tests, all strains were accurately identified to the species level, and their susceptibilities to clinically relevant antibiotics were determined by a standardized agar dilution technique. e. faecalis and e. faecium accounted for 87.3% and 9.2% of isolates, respectively. e. avium (1%), e. gallinarum (1%), e. durans (0.6%), e. hirae (0.6%), and e. casseliflavus (0.3%) isolates were also identified. eleven strains of e. faecium and 1 e. hirae isolate were resistant to ampicillin, but none of the isolates produced beta-lactamase. twenty-three e. faecium and 3 e. faecalis strains as well as 1 e. hirae isolate revealed imipenem resistance. a total of 25.4% enterococci (60 e. faecalis and 19 e. faecium isolates, 1 e. hirae strain) were erythromycin-resistant. twelve strains (11 e. faecium and 1 e. avium) exhibited ciprofloxacin resistance. high-level resistance to streptomycin was found in 58 (21.1%) e. faecalis, 9 (31%) e. faecium, and both e. hirae strains, whereas high-level gentamicin resistance (hlgr) was exclusively seen in the species e. faecalis (11.6% of isolates belonging to this species). a  simple agar screening test containing 500 micrograms of gentamicin per ml proved  to be highly reliable for detection of hlgr. the structural gene coding for hlgr  was specifically amplified by the polymerase chain reaction in all isolates showing this resistance trait. moreover, the gene was specifically detected by a  nonradioactively labelled oligonucleotide probe in colony blot hybridization assays, indicating the potential application of these molecular approaches as a diagnostic tool.

TI  == use of primers selective for vancomycin resistance genes to determine van genotype in enterococci and to study gene organization in vana isolates.
AB  == vancomycin resistance in enterococci is an emerging therapeutic problem. resistance is not always detected by standard microbiological methods. oligonucleotide primers for pcr were designed to target amplification of defined  regions of genes of the vana cluster, as well as vanb and vanc1. these primers correctly identified 30 vancomycin-resistant isolates tested (17 vana, 7 vanb, and 6 enterococcus gallinarum). no amplification was observed with enterococcus casseliflavus or vancomycin-susceptible strains. using pcr and southern blotting, we found that all 17 vana isolates had orf-1, orf-2, vanr, vans, vanh, vana, and  vany genes in the same sequence and that the intergenic distances in the vanr-vana segments were the same. the described methods should be applicable to the rapid detection of the different vancomycin resistance genotypes in enterococci.

AB  == forty-eight clinical isolates identified as either enterococcus faecium or enterococcus faecalis with the microscan system (dade international, microscan inc., west sacramento, calif.) were further characterized by two supplementary biochemical tests (pigment production and motility). twenty isolates (42%), all initially identified as e. faecium, were motile. of these 20, 8 isolates (17%) produced yellow pigment and were identified as enterococcus casseliflavus and the remaining 12 (25%) were nonpigmented and were identified as enterococcus gallinarum. identical identification results were obtained when pcr amplification of regions of the vanc gene was used as a technique for differentiating these organisms. the results of this study indicate that motility and pigment production tests together with commercial test systems are sufficient for reliable identifications of e. faecium, e. casseliflavus, and e. gallinarum.

TI  == investigation of the reformulated remel synergy quad plate for detection of high-level aminoglycoside and vancomycin resistance among enterococci.
AB  == we investigated the accuracy of the recently released remel synergy quad plate, a commercially available agar screening method for detecting high-level aminoglycoside and vancomycin resistance among enterococci that is based on the national committee for clinical laboratory standards recommended guidelines (national committee for clinical laboratory standards, m7-a3, 1993). the synergy  quad correctly determined the gentamicin and streptomycin resistance status for > or = 97% of 147 enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium isolates tested. detection of vancomycin resistance also was reliable, as no false susceptibility  occurred with 36 vancomycin-resistant e. faecalis and e. faecium strains and false resistance occurred only once with the 47 susceptible strains tested. one strain each of enterococcus gallinarum and enterococcus casseliflavus failed to grow on the screen, but because the true nature and significance of resistance in such isolates is unknown the implication of their screen negativity is uncertain. in summary, the remel synergy quad provides a highly accurate and convenient method for susceptibility testing of enterococci against gentamicin, streptomycin, and vancomycin.

TI  == high-level gentamicin resistance among enterococci.
AB  == the bi-functional enzyme 6'-aminoglycoside acetyltransferase (aac-6')-2" aminoglycoside phosphotransferase (aph-2"), which is encoded by the 2 kb fused gene aaca-aphd, mediates gentamicin resistance in enterococcus faecalis. this gene is associated with the composite transposon tn5281 that shares extensive homology with transposons tn4001 and tn4031 found in staphylococci. typically these transposons are characterized by the resistance gene being flanked by 1.35  kb insertion sequences (is256). the resistance gene (aaca-aphd) appears identical among all e. faecalis studied, but restriction enzyme analysis indicates notable  heterogeneity within the flanking regions. various combinations of is256-like and is257-like elements, or portions thereof, have been described in different resistant isolates. as gentamicin resistance has been described in other enterococcal species (e. faecium, e. avium, e. gallinarum, e. raffinosus, e. casseliflavus) homology with the resistance gene of e. faecalis has largely been  maintained, but more extensive variations in the flanking sequences have been noted. although many similarities exist among enterococcal gentamicin resistance  determinants, heterogeneity in the flanking regions indicates that measurable divergence exists among these determinants. this divergence may be of value in characterizing the mechanisms and natural course of gentamicin resistance dissemination which now includes staphylococci, enterococci and streptococci.

AB  == a pcr assay that allows simultaneous detection of glycopeptide resistance genotypes and identification to the species level of clinically relevant enterococci (enterococcus faecium, e. faecalis, e. gallinarum, and e. casseliflavus) was developed. this assay was based on specific amplification of internal fragments of genes encoding d-alanine:d-alanine ligases and related glycopeptide resistance proteins. the specificity of the assay was tested on 5 well-characterized glycopeptide-resistant strains and on 15 susceptible enterococcal type strains. clinical isolates of enterococci that could not be identified to the species level by conventional methods were identified by the pcr test. this assay offers a specific and rapid alternative to antibiotic susceptibility tests, in particular for detection of low-level vancomycin resistance.

AB  == we collected 705 isolates of enterococci (1 per patient) from cultures of a variety of anatomic sites from patients at eight tertiary-care hospitals in six geographic regions of the united states. a total of 632 (90%) enterococcus faecalis, 58 (8%) e. faecium, 5 e. gallinarum, 4 e. avium, 3 e. casseliflavus, 1  e. raffinosus, and 1 e. hirae isolate and 1 biochemical variant of e. faecalis were identified; 606 (86%) of these isolates were associated with clinical infections. the most common sites of isolation were the urinary tract (402 [57%]), nonsurgical wounds (94 [13%]), the bloodstream (74 [10%]), and surgical wounds (62 [9%]). high-level resistance to gentamicin or streptomycin or both was detected in 265 (38%) of the isolates. we identified two e. faecalis isolates resistant to vancomycin (mics, 32 and 128 micrograms/ml) and 11 beta-lactamase-producing e. faecalis isolates. e. faecium isolates were significantly more resistant than e. faecalis isolates to penicillin, ampicillin, piperacillin, imipenem, and ciprofloxacin (p less than 0.001). the mics for the 15 non-e. faecalis, non-e. faecium enterococci indicated variable resistance to ciprofloxacin and the penicillins. antimicrobial susceptibility patterns vary among species of enterococci, and these organisms, while commonly resistant to high-level aminoglycosides, can also acquire resistance to vancomycin or the ability to produce beta-lactamase. because of these diverse antimicrobial resistance mechanisms, successful treatment and control of enterococcal infections with current antimicrobial agents are becoming increasingly difficult.

TI  == detection of high-level aminoglycoside resistance in enterococci other than enterococcus faecalis.
AB  == the ability of six screening methods to detect high-level aminoglycoside resistance in enterococcal species other than enterococcus faecalis was investigated. the 85 enterococcus isolates, which included 55 e. faecium, 11 e. gallinarum, 9 e. casseliflavus, 5 e. raffinosus, 4 e. avium, and 1 e. mundtii, were tested by using aminoglycoside-supplemented brain heart infusion agar (bhi), remel ef synergy quad plates, high-content aminoglycoside diffusion disks, standard (prepared in-house) microdilution panels, pasco mic gram positive microdilution panels, and vitek gps-ta cards. when tested on bhi, 32 and 35 strains showed resistance to gentamicin and streptomycin, respectively. resistance profiles obtained with remel ef synergy quad plates were in complete agreement with those obtained on bhi. however, growth on mueller-hinton agar-based plates was not as heavy. some isolates showed only weak growth and required 48 h for resistance to become evident, especially with swab inoculation  of quadrants containing 2,000 micrograms of gentamicin per ml. profiles obtained  by use of the agar-based screens were used as the basis for evaluating the other  methods. disk diffusion showed complete agreement. no false resistance occurred by either microdilution method, but 48 h of incubation was needed for detection of some gentamicin-resistant isolates, and 14% of the streptomycin-resistant strains were not detected by standard microdilution. the vitek gps-ta card detected 81 and 100% of the gentamicin- and streptomycin-resistant isolates, respectively. in general, most methods used to detect high-level aminoglycoside resistance in e. faecalis appear to be reliable for the testing of the other enterococcal species. however, further investigations with a greater number of resistant e. raffinosus, e. avium, and e. mundtii isolates, when they are available, will be useful for establishing the full range of enterococci that can reliably be tested by the various methods.

TI  == recovery of vancomycin-resistant gram-positive cocci from pediatric liver transplant recipients.
AB  == between november 1988 and october 1989, 49 first-time pediatric liver transplant  recipients at the children's hospital of pittsburgh were prospectively monitored  for the presence of stool colonization and the development of disease caused by vancomycin-resistant gram-positive cocci (vrgpc). quantitative stool culturing was done on a weekly basis, and cultures were planted onto a selective medium for vrgpc. isolates for which the mic was greater than or equal to 8 were considered  resistant to vancomycin. patients were monitored clinically for the development of infection, and their charts were systematically reviewed for the use of antibiotics. eighty-six isolates were recovered from 36 of the 49 patients. enterococcal species were isolated from 31 patients and included enterococcus gallinarum (n = 28), e. casseliflavus (n = 14), e. faecium (n = 9), e. faecalis (n = 2), e. mundtii (n = 2), and e. durans (n = 1). stool colonization with vancomycin-resistant enterococci was noted to increase steadily during the first  month after transplantation. only 9 of 31 patients demonstrated clearance of these organisms in serial repeat cultures. additional isolates of vrgpc included  lactobacillus confusus (n = 13), lactobacillus spp. (n = 12), and pediococcus pentosaceus (n = 4). infection due to vrgpc developed in three patients: a urinary tract infection in two and peritonitis in one. e. faecium was the pathogen in each of these cases. the ranges of mics of vancomycin were 8 to 32 micrograms/ml for all enterococcal isolates and greater than 128 micrograms/ml for lactobacillus and pediococcus isolates. all lactobacillus and pediococcus isolates were resistant to teicoplanin, although they were susceptible to daptomycin. all other isolates were susceptible to both teicoplanin and daptomycin. this study demonstrates that stool colonization with vrgpc may be a common and early finding among pediatric liver transplant recipients. however, infection appears to be uncommon.

TI  == vancomycin susceptibility and identification of motile enterococci.
AB  == thirty-seven clinical isolates of enterococcus gallinarum and enterococcus casseliflavus and three type or reference strains of the species were studied with respect to vancomycin susceptibility and key identification characteristics. with the exception of one clinical isolate of e. casseliflavus (mic, 4 micrograms/ml), mics of vancomycin were 8 to 32 micrograms/ml. the type strain of e. gallinarum, ncdo 2313, and five of the clinical isolates had similar penicillin-binding protein profiles and shared 90 to 100% dna homology. two isolates, identified as e. gallinarum by conventional tests, were shown to be non-pigment-producing e. casseliflavus on the basis of penicillin-binding protein profile and dna homology. the type and reference strains of e. casseliflavus, atcc 25788 and atcc 25789, were nonmotile in our experiments. however, both shared 65 to 100% dna homology with each other and with five clinical isolates of e. casseliflavus. these data suggest that the mics of vancomycin observed for strains of e. gallinarum and e. casseliflavus are higher than those usually associated with other enterococci and may be a common property of these species.  additionally, pigment production and motility may occasionally be misleading criteria for definitive identification of these organisms.

TI  == intrageneric relationships of enterococci as determined by reverse transcriptase  sequencing of small-subunit rrna.
AB  == the 16s ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rrna) sequences of eleven enterococcus species were determined by reverse transcription in an attempt to clarify their intrageneric relationships. comparative analysis of the sequence data revealed the presence of several species groups within the genus. the species e. avium, e. malodoratus, e. pseudoavium and e. raffinosus formed a distinct group as did e. durans, e. faecium, e. hirae and e. mundtii and the pair of species e. casseliflavus and e. gallinarum. of the remaining species, e. cecorum, e. columbae, e. faecalis and e. saccharolyticus formed distinct lines of descent within the genus, whereas e. solitarius displayed a closer affinity with tetragenococcus halophilus than with other enterococcal species.

TI  == species identities of enterococci isolated from clinical specimens.
AB  == conventional tests and commercially available systems were used to determine the  species identities of clinical isolates of enterococci. strict adherence to the conventional test scheme of facklam and collins (r. r. facklam and m. d. collins, j. clin. microbiol. 27:731-734, 1989) resulted in the misidentification of lactose-negative enterococcus faecalis isolates as enterococcus solitarius, but this problem was overcome by the application of additional tests. the commercially available systems tested were unable to recognize some of the more recently described enterococcal species. e. faecalis accounted for 87.1% of 302 consecutive isolates. enterococcus faecium (8.6%), enterococcus avium (0.7%), enterococcus durans (0.3%), enterococcus gallinarum (1.0%), enterococcus casseliflavus (1.0%), enterococcus hirae (0.3%), and enterococcus raffinosus (0.3%) isolates were also identified. none of the isolates produced beta-lactamase, but 15.4% of 235 isolates tested, including 1 strain of e. gallinarum, displayed high-level resistance to gentamicin.

TI  == use of penicillin-binding proteins for the identification of enterococci.
AB  == the results of 20 physiological and fermentation tests and examination of the penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) of 85 enterococcal strains demonstrated that the genus enterococcus could be divided into at least nine distinct species: e. faecalis, e. faecium, e. durans, e. hirae, e. avium, e. gallinarum, e. casseliflavus, e. malodoratus and e. mundtii. each species had a specific pattern of at least five pbps, with molecular masses in the range of about 40-130 kda. the pattern of pbps may be useful for identification purposes, since some strains with unusual fermentation characteristics were assigned to species by this technique.

TI  == numerical taxonomy of streptococcus.
AB  == a numerical taxonomic study of strains of streptococcus, together with representatives of allied genera, showed 28 reasonably distinct phenons. the major areas, with their phenons, were: (a) enterococcal species group (s. faecalis, s. faecium, 's. avium' and a proposed new species 's. gallinarum'); (b) paraviridans species group (s. bovis, s. equinus, s. salivarius, 's. casseliflavus', s. mutans, s. raffinolactis and an unidentified oral group i); (c) lactic species group (s. lactis including s. cremoris); (d) thermophilic species group (s. thermophilus); (e) viridans species group (s. mitis, s. sanguis, a proposed new species 's. oralis' and 's. milleri'); (f) pyogenic species group (s. agalactiae, s. pyogenes, s. equi, 's. equisimilis' including 's. zooepidemicus, and a cluster of lancefield group b strains of human origin);  (g) parapyogenic species group (s. uberis, 's. dysgalactiae', and a cluster of strains of lancefield groups r, s and t). species of aerococcus, gemella, leuconostoc and pediococcus are very closely related to the streptococci.
