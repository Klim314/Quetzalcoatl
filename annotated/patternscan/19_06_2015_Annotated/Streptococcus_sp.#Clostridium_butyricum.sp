TI  == effectiveness of probiotic therapy for the prevention of relapse in patients with inactive ulcerative colitis.
AB  == aim: to evaluate the effectiveness of probiotic therapy for suppressing relapse in patients with inactive ulcerative colitis (uc). methods: bio-three tablets, each containing 2 mg of lactomin (streptococcus faecalis t-110), 10 mg of clostridium butyricum to-a, and 10 mg of bacillus mesentericus to-a, were used as probiotic therapy. sixty outpatients with uc in remission were randomly assigned  to receive 9 bio-three tablets/day (bio-three group) or 9 placebo tablets/day (placebo group) for 12 mo in addition to their ongoing medications. clinical symptoms were evaluated monthly or on the exacerbation of symptoms or need for additional medication. fecal samples were collected to analyze bacterial dna at baseline and 3-mo intervals. terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism and cluster analyses were done to examine bacterial components of the fecal microflora. results: forty-six patients, 23 in each group, completed the study, and 14 were excluded. the relapse rates in the bio-three and placebo groups were  respectively 0.0% vs 17.4% at 3 mo (p = 0.036), 8.7% vs 26.1% at 6 mo (p = 0.119), and 21.7% vs 34.8% (p = 0.326) at 9 mo. at 12 mo, the remission rate was  69.5% in the bio-three group and 56.6% in the placebo group (p = 0.248). on cluster analysis of fecal flora, 7 patients belonged to cluster i, 32 to cluster  ii, and 7 to cluster iii. conclusion: probiotics may be effective for maintaining clinical remission in patients with quiescent uc, especially those who belong to  cluster i on fecal bacterial analysis.

TI  == genome sequencing of clostridium butyricum dku-01, isolated from infant feces.
AB  == background: clostridium butyricum is a butyric acid-producing anaerobic bacteriuma, and commonly present as gut microbiota in humans. this species has been used as a probiotic for the prevention of diarrhea in humans. in this study, we report the draft genome of c. butyricum dku-01, which was isolated from infant feces, to better understand the characteristics of this strain so that it can later be used in the development of probiotic products. results: a total of 79 contigs generated by hybrid assembly of sequences obtained from roche 454 and illumina miseq sequencing systems were investigated. the assembled genome of strain dku-01 consisted of 4,519,722 bp (28.62% g + c content) with a n50 contig  length of 108,221 bp and 4,037 predicted cdss. the extracted 16s rrna gene from genome sequences of dku-01 was similar to clostridium butyricum with 99.63% pairwise similarity. the sequence of strain dku-01 was compared with previously reported genome sequences of c. butyricum. the value of average nucleotide identity between strains dku-01 and c. butyricum 60e3 was 98.74%, making it the most similar strain to dku-01. conclusions: we sequenced the dku-01 strain isolated from infant feces, and compared it with the available genomes of c. butyricum on a public database. genes related to fructooligosaccharide utilization were detected in the genome of strain dku-01 and compared with other  genera, such as bifidobacterium and streptococcus. we found that strain dku-01 can metabolize a wide range of carbohydrates in comparative genome result. further analyses of the comparative genome and fermentation study can provide the information necessary for the development of strain dku-01 for probiotics.

TI  == pontic morphology as local risk factor in root decay and periodontal disease.
AB  == introduction: in absence of treatment, old single edentulous spaces are subjected to progressively decrease in length due to tilting and rotation of the teeth situated mesial and distal. lately when these spaces are prosthetically restored  with a bridge and these teeth are becoming abutments, sanitizing of the prosthetic restoration is achieved with difficulty, the space between the pontic  and the gingival surface becoming an area rich in pathogens that can cause various complications on the abutments. aim: considering these aspects, in this study we wanted to highlight the presence and the types of the microorganisms that can be found under the pontic even in an ideal situation, selecting only young adult patients with a good oral hygiene and only with metal-ceramic bridges. materials and methods: determination of microorganisms was achieved by growing on bd columbia agar with 5% sheep blood. incubation was done in anaerobe  condition using genbag system produced by biomerieux company. results: the microorganisms that we determined were streptococcus mutans, s. mitis, s. oralis, gram-negative bacilli (bacteroides ovatus, b. thetaiotaomicron) and gram-positive bacilli (bifidobacterium spp., actinomyces israelii, clostridium butyricum / beijerinckii) with relevance in the carious and periodontal disease. conclusions: in cases of single unit bridges with very narrow pontics, even in patients with a very good oral hygiene and metal-ceramic restorations, we can still find micro-organisms that can potentially generate decay or periodontal disease on the abutments, located in the gingival area underneath these pontics. these bacteria  can have negative implications on the long-term prognosis of prosthetic restorations.

TI  == an open-label randomized controlled trial of lactulose and probiotics in the treatment of minimal hepatic encephalopathy.
AB  == background and aim: minimal hepatic encephalopathy (mhe) is associated with poor  quality of life and increased work disability. treatment with lactulose and probiotics has shown some benefit. we compared lactulose with probiotics and a combination of lactulose plus probiotics in the treatment of mhe. patients and methods: one hundred and ninety cirrhotic patients without overt encephalopathy [child's a grade 71 patients (37.4%), child's b grade 72 patients (37.9%), child's c grade 47 patients (24.7%)] were evaluated by psychometry (number connection tests a and b or figure connection tests a and b) and p300 auditory event-related potential (p300erp). mhe was diagnosed by abnormal psychometry and/or p300erp. patients were randomized to receive lactulose [group a (n=35): dose 30-60 ml/day], probiotics [group b (n=35): dose 1 capsule three times/day, each capsule contained streptococcus faecalis 60 million, clostridium butyricum 4 million, bacillus mesentricus 2 million, lactic acid bacillus 100 million] and lactulose plus probiotics [group c (n=35)] for 1 month. response was defined by normalization of the abnormal test parameters. results: mhe was diagnosed in 105  (55.2%) patients. of the 105 patients, 75 (71%) had both abnormal psychometry and p300erp, whereas 90 (86%) had abnormal psychometry alone, and 89 patients (85%) had abnormal p300erp alone. significant improvement was seen in abnormal psychometry tests (group a: n=31 vs. n=12, group b: n=29 vs. n=14, group c: n=30  vs. n=10), p300erp (group a: 376.8+/-22.3 vs. 344.3+/-30.6 ms, group b: 385.4+/-28.5 vs. 355.5+/-27.9 ms, group c: 387.7+/-27.5 vs. 347.7+/-31.5 ms) and  venous ammonia levels (group a: 102.3+/-63.1 vs. 69.3+/-33.3 micromol/l, group b: 108.2+/-37.5 vs. 75.7+/-33.0 micromol/l, group c: 96.3+/-27.7 vs. 68.7+/-28.4 micromol/l) in lactulose, probiotics and a combination of lactulose plus probiotics groups after treatment. normalization of abnormal psychometry and p300erp was seen in 54.8, 51.6 and 56.6% of patients treated with lactulose, probiotics and lactulose plus probiotics groups, respectively. conclusion: a total of 55% of the patients with cirrhosis had mhe. lactulose or probiotics or combinations of both are equally effective in the treatment of mhe.

TI  == clostridium butyricum to-a culture supernatant downregulates tlr4 in human colonic epithelial cells.
AB  == the present study was performed to examine whether probiotics affect toll-like receptor 4 (tlr4) expression in human colonic epithelial cells. culture supernatants or heat-killed bacteria of bacillus mesentericus to-a, clostridium butyricum to-a, and streptococcus faecalis t-110 were applied to human colonic epithelial cells. treatment with c. butyricum to-a culture supernatant significantly reduced tlr4 mrna level (x0.16), even in the presence of interferon-gamma (ifn-gamma; x0.21) as compared with untreated controls. high-performance liquid chromatography analysis showed that c. butyricum to-a supernatant contains formate, acetate, and butyrate. interestingly, tlr4 mrna was significantly suppressed (x0.15-x0.22) only when cells were treated with solutions containing butyrate. electrophoretic mobility shift assay suggested that the binding affinity of pu.1 to the promoter region of the tlr4 gene was markedly inhibited when the cells were treated with butyrate. this study suggested that butyrate produced by c. butyricum to-a downregulates tlr4 mrna level in human colonic epithelial cells.

TI  == characterization of culturable anaerobic bacteria from the forestomach of an eastern grey kangaroo, macropus giganteus.
AB  == aim: to determine the culturable biodiversity of anaerobic bacteria isolated from the forestomach contents of an eastern grey kangaroo, macropus giganteus, using phenotypic characterization and 16s rdna sequence analysis. methods and results:  bacteria from forestomach contents of an eastern grey kangaroo were isolated using anaerobic media containing milled curly mitchell grass (astrebla lappacea). dna was extracted and the 16s rdna sequenced for phylogenetic analysis. forty bacterial isolates were obtained and placed in 17 groups based on phenotypic characteristics and restriction enzyme digestion of 16s rdna pcr products. dna sequencing revealed that the 17 groups comprised five known species (clostridium  butyricum, streptococcus bovis, clostridium sporogenes, clostridium paraputrificum and enterococcus avium) and 12 groups apparently representing new  species, all within the phylum firmicutes. conclusions: foregut contents from australian macropod marsupials contain a microbial ecosystem with a novel bacterial biodiversity comprising a high percentage of previously unrecognized species. significance and impact of the study: this study adds to knowledge of australia's unique biodiversity, which may provide a future bioresource of genetic information and bacterial species of benefit to agriculture.

TI  == probiotic mixture decreases dna adduct formation in colonic epithelium induced by the food mutagen 2-amino-9h-pyrido[2,3-b]indole in a human-flora associated mouse model.
AB  == consumption of probiotic bacteria such as bifidobacteria has been shown to reduce the risk of colon cancer in animal models. however, the composition and metabolic activities of the intestinal flora of experimental animals are significantly different from those of humans. the aim of the study was to examine whether the probiotic mixture, which consisted of streptococcus faecalis, clostridium butyricum and bacillus mesentericus, could decrease dna adduct formation induced  by 2-amino-9h-pyrido[2,3-b]indole (2-amino-alpha-carboline; aac) in the colonic epithelium of a human-flora-associated (hfa) mouse model. ten hfa mice were divided into a control group (n=4) and a probiotic group (n=6). the control group was administered aac for 3 days and sacrificed 24 h after the last dose. the probiotic group was administered the probiotic mixture for 2 weeks prior to the administration of aac. analysis of dna adducts with the 32p-high-performance liquid chromatography method was performed on stomach, jejunum and colonic epithelium, representing direct exposure sites of aac, and colon wall, liver and  kidney, representing indirect exposure sites. the mean level of the dna adducts in the colonic epithelium of the probiotic group was significantly lower than that of control group, while the mean levels at the other sites did not differ significantly between the groups. the results indicated that the probiotic mixture could decrease the dna adduct formation in the colonic epithelium induced by aac.

TI  == [combination use of kampo-medicines and drugs affecting intestinal bacterial flora].
AB  == the intestinal bacteria, eubacterium sp. and bifidobacterium sp., participate in  the metabolism of active kampo-ingredients, glycyrrhizin (gl), sennoside (sen) and baicalin (bl). since antibiotics and bacterial preparations, bifidobacterium  longum (lac-b), clostridium butyricum (miya-bm), and streptococcus faecalis (biofermin), affect the bacterial population in intestinal bacterial flora, metabolism of the active kampo-ingredients in the bacterial flora may be altered  by their combined administration. we investigated 1199 prescriptions including kampo-medicines for 308 patients. combination use of kampo-medicines with antibiotics and bacterial preparations occurred with 7% and 10% of the kampo-prescription, respectively. most antibiotics have activity against intestinal bacteria, except that cephems and macrolides are not active against to e. coli. this means that antibiotics may lower the metabolism of gl, sen and bl when administered in combination. on the other hand, it is also highly possible that bacterial preparations increase the number of eubacterium sp. and bifidobacterium sp., resulting in enhanced metabolism of gl and sen when they are used concomitantly with kampo-medicines. the present results suggested that the drug interactions of kampo-medicines with antibiotics and bacterial preparations  should be confirmed in clinical studies.

TI  == in vitro utilization of amylopectin and high-amylose maize (amylomaize) starch granules by human colonic bacteria.
AB  == it has been well established that a certain amount of ingested starch can escape  digestion in the human small intestine and consequently enters the large intestine, where it may serve as a carbon source for bacterial fermentation. thirty-eight types of human colonic bacteria were screened for their capacity to  utilize soluble starch, gelatinized amylopectin maize starch, and high-amylose maize starch granules by measuring the clear zones on starch agar plates. the six cultures which produced clear zones on amylopectin maize starch- containing plates were selected for further studies for utilization of amylopectin maize starch and high-amylose maize starch granules a (amylose; sigma) and b (culture pro 958n). sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) was used to detect bacterial starch-degrading enzymes. it was demonstrated that bifidobacterium spp., bacteroides spp., fusobacterium spp., and strains of eubacterium, clostridium, streptococcus, and propionibacterium could hydrolyze the gelatinized amylopectin maize starch, while only bifidobacterium spp. and clostridium butyricum could efficiently utilize high-amylose maize starch granules. in fact, c. butyricum and bifidobacterium spp. had higher specific growth rates in the autoclaved medium containing high-amylose maize starch granules and hydrolyzed 80 and 40% of the amylose, respectively. starch-degrading enzymes were cell bound on bifidobacterium and bacteroides cells and were extracellular for c. butyricum. active staining for starch-degrading enzymes on sds-page gels showed that the bifidobacterium cells produced several starch-degrading enzymes with high relative molecular (m(r)) weights (>160,000),  medium-sized relative molecular weights (>66,000), and low relative molecular weights (<66,000). it was concluded that bifidobacterium spp. and c. butyricum degraded and utilized granules of amylomaize starch.

TI  == does probiotics administration decrease serum endotoxin levels in infants?
AB  == purpose: the aim of this study was to examine whether administration of probiotics to infants can change the ratio of intestinal flora and thereby decrease serum endotoxin produced by potentially pathogenic microorganisms. methods: nine infants including five with of biliary atresia, two with omphalocele, one each with hirschsprung's disease and imperforate anus were studied. all patients were stable, and no antibiotics were given during this study. a probiotic mixture consisting of streptococcus faecalis, clostridium butyricum and bacillus mesentericus was administered orally to each infant at 2 g/day for 2 weeks. fecal aerobic and anaerobic bacterial cultures, serum endotoxin level, and other biochemical parameters were examined. results: in fecal cultures, anaerobic bacteria including bifidobacterium increased significantly whereas escherichia coli, streptococcus, and klebsiella tended to decrease. the ratio of anaerobic to aerobic bacteria increased five times as a result of administration of probiotics, and serum endotoxin levels decreased. conclusions: probiotics affect intestinal bacterial flora by increasing anaerobic bacteria and decreasing the population of potentially pathogenic microorganisms.  a decrease in luminal endotoxin may result in less endotoxin translocation or bacterial translocation.

TI  == [estimation of probiotics by infection model of infant rabbit with enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli o157:h7].
AB  == we examined the preventative effect against enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli o157:h7 (ehec) infection in rabbits on administration of probiotics contained in  streptococcus faecalis, clostridium butyricum and bacillus mesentericus. the probiotics were administered to 5 days old japanese white rabbits throughout the  experiment. inoculation of 10(6) colony forming units (cfus) of ehec per rabbit was tried 8 days after birth. three days after ehec inoculation, in the control group (not administered probiotics), diarrhea was observed in approximately 80% of the rabbits, on the other hand, in the group administered probiotics, rabbits  showed diarrhea in 15%. in necropsy, the number of ehec in the contents of the cecum and the number of attaching and effacing (ae) lesions were fewer in the probiotics group than in the control group. these results suggest that infant rabbits are useful as a colitis model for ehec, and the probiotics are effective  for the prevention of the growth of ehec in the intestine and for diarrhea.

TI  == molecular analysis of a clostridium butyricum ncimb 7423 gene encoding 4-alpha-glucanotransferase and characterization of the recombinant enzyme produced in escherichia coli.
AB  == an escherichia coli clone was detected in a clostridium butyricum ncimb 7423 plasmid library capable of degrading soluble amylose. deletion subcloning of its  recombinant plasmid indicated that the gene(s) responsible for amylose degradation was localized on a 1.8 kb nsphi-scal fragment. this region was sequenced in its entirety and shown to encompass a large orf capable of encoding  a protein with a calculated molecular mass of 57,184 da. although the deduced amino acid sequence showed only weak similarity with known amylases, significant  sequences identity was apparent with the 4-alpha-glucano-transferase enzymes of streptococcus pneumoniae (46.9%), potato (42.9%) and e. coli (16.2%). the clostridial gene (designated maiq) was followed by a second orf which, through its homology to the equivalent enzymes of e. coli and s. pneumoniae, was deduced  to encode maltodextrin phosphorylase (maip). the translation stop codon of maiq overlapped the translation start codon of the putative maip gene, suggesting that the two genes may be both transcriptionally and translationally coupled. 4-alpha-glucanotransferase catalyses a disproportionation reaction in which single or multiple glucose units from oligosaccharides are transferred to the 4-hydroxyl group of acceptor sugars. characterization of the recombinant c. butyricum enzyme demonstrated that glucose, maltose and maltotriose could act as  acceptor, whereas of the three only maltotriose could act as donor. the enzyme therefore shares properties with the e. coli maiq protein, but differs significantly from the glucanotransferase of thermotoga maritima, which is unable to use maltotriose as donor or glucose as acceptor. physiologically, the concerted action of 4-alpha-glucanotransferase and maltodextrin phosphorylase provides c. butyricum with a mechanism of utilizing amylose/maltodextrins with little drain on cellular atp reserves.

TI  == conjugative plasmid transfer from escherichia coli to clostridium acetobutylicum.
AB  == the conjugation mechanism of incp plasmids may be employed to mobilize small non-conjugative plasmids from escherichia coli to a wide range of different organisms. this strategy has been adapted for use with the gram-positive anaerobe, clostridium acetobutylicum ncib 8052. several shuttle vectors containing replicons from pam beta 1 (enterococcus faecalis), pcb101 (clostridium butyricum) or pwv01 (streptococcus cremoris), together with the cis-acting orit region of rk2, have been constructed, and transferred to and established in this  organism. one of the vectors apparently contains a hot spot for insertion of is1. conjugative mobilization of plasmids from e. coli will provide a useful alternative to electroporation for effecting gene transfer to this industrially important anaerobe.

TI  == pathogenicity of clostridium species with other bacteria in mixed infections.
AB  == the relationship of clostridial isolates with other bacteria in mixed infections  was studied by means of a subcutaneous abscess model in mice. we used 26 isolates of seven clostridial species, two bacteroides spp., eight gram-positive facultative or anaerobic cocci and three enteric gram-negative aerobic rods. abscesses were induced by all seven clostridium perfringens and three c. butyricum isolates and by some of the others. selective antimicrobial therapy experiments showed that enteric gram-negative rods were of equal or greater significance in the formation of abscesses than were clostridial strains in mixed infections. enhancement or suppression of each component of the mixed infection was studied by comparing the number of each bacterium to its number when injected alone. enhancement was observed mainly with c. perfringens in mixed infections. by contrast, other clostridium spp. were less able to induce enhancement. clostridium difficile and c. sporogenes often inhibited other bacterial species.  this study demonstrated the synergistic and antagonistic relationship between clostridial species and other bacteria.
