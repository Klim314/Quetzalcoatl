TI  - Intracranial bacterial infections of oral origin.
AB  - Brain abscesses are rare but potentially deadly complications of odontogenic infections. This phenomenon has been described mainly in the form of case reports, as large-scale studies are difficult to perform. We compiled a total of 60 previously published cases of such a complication to investigate the predisposing factors, microbiology, and clinical outcomes of intracranial abscesses of odontogenic origin. A systematic review of the literature using the PubMed database was performed. Men accounted for 82.1% of cases, and the mean age was 42.1 years. Caries with periapical involvement and periodontitis were the two most common intra-oral sources, and wisdom tooth extraction was the most common preceding dental procedure. In 56.4% of cases, there were obvious signs of dental disease prior to development of intracranial infection. Commonly implicated microorganisms included Streptococcus viridans (especially the anginosus group), Actinomyces, Peptostreptococcus, Prevotella, Fusobacterium, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and Eikenella corrodens. There was an 8.3% mortality rate. Intracranial abscesses can form anywhere within the brain, and appear unrelated to the side of dental involvement. This suggests that hematogenous spread is the most likely route of dissemination.
TI  - Quantitative proteomics reveal distinct protein regulations caused by Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans within subgingival biofilms.
AB  - Periodontitis is an infectious disease that causes the inflammatory destruction of the tooth-supporting (periodontal) tissues, caused by polymicrobial biofilm communities growing on the tooth surface. Aggressive periodontitis is strongly associated with the presence of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans in the subgingival biofilms. Nevertheless, whether and how A. actinomycetemcomitans orchestrates molecular changes within the biofilm is unclear. The aim of this work was to decipher the interactions between A. actinomycetemcomitans and other bacterial species in a multi-species biofilm using proteomic analysis. An in vitro 10-species "subgingival" biofilm model, or its derivative that included additionally A. actinomycetemcomitans, were anaerobically cultivated on hydroxyapatite discs for 64 h. When present, A. actinomycetemcomitans formed dense intra-species clumps within the biofilm mass, and did not affect the numbers of the other species in the biofilm. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was used to identify the proteomic content of the biofilm lysate. A total of 3225 and 3352 proteins were identified in the biofilm, in presence or absence of A. actinomycetemcomitans, respectively. Label-free quantitative proteomics revealed that 483 out of the 728 quantified bacterial proteins (excluding those of A. actinomycetemcomitans) were accordingly regulated. Interestingly, all quantified proteins from Prevotella intermedia were up-regulated, and most quantified proteins from Campylobacter rectus, Streptococcus anginosus, and Porphyromonas gingivalis were down-regulated in presence of A. actinomycetemcomitans. Enrichment of Gene Ontology pathway analysis showed that the regulated groups of proteins were responsible primarily for changes in the metabolic rate, the ferric iron-binding, and the 5S RNA binding capacities, on the universal biofilm level. While the presence of A. actinomycetemcomitans did not affect the numeric composition or absolute protein numbers of the other biofilm species, it caused qualitative changes in their overall protein expression profile. These molecular shifts within the biofilm warrant further investigation on their potential impact on its virulence properties, and association with periodontal pathogenesis.
TI  - Oral bacterial DNA findings in pericardial fluid.
AB  - BACKGROUND: We recently reported that large amounts of oral bacterial DNA can be  found in thrombus aspirates of myocardial infarction patients. Some case reports describe bacterial findings in pericardial fluid, mostly done with conventional culturing and a few with PCR; in purulent pericarditis, nevertheless, bacterial PCR has not been used as a diagnostic method before. OBJECTIVE: To find out whether bacterial DNA can be measured in the pericardial fluid and if it correlates with pathologic-anatomic findings linked to cardiovascular diseases. METHODS: Twenty-two pericardial aspirates were collected aseptically prior to forensic autopsy at Tampere University Hospital during 2009-2010. Of the autopsies, 10 (45.5%) were free of coronary artery disease (CAD), 7 (31.8%) had mild and 5 (22.7%) had severe CAD. Bacterial DNA amounts were determined using real-time quantitative PCR with specific primers and probes for all bacterial strains associated with endodontic disease (Streptococcus mitis group, Streptococcus anginosus group, Staphylococcus aureus/Staphylococcus epidermidis, Prevotella intermedia, Parvimonas micra) and periodontal disease (Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema denticola, Fusobacterium nucleatus, and Dialister pneumosintes). RESULTS: Of 22 cases, 14 (63.6%) were positive for endodontic and 8 (36.4%) for periodontal-disease-associated bacteria. Only one case was positive for bacterial culturing. There was a statistically significant association between the relative amount of bacterial DNA in the pericardial fluid and the severity of CAD (p=0.035). CONCLUSIONS: Oral bacterial DNA was detectable in pericardial fluid and an association between the severity of CAD and the total amount of bacterial DNA in pericardial fluid was found, suggesting that this kind of measurement might be useful for clinical purposes.
TI  - Microarray analysis of microbiota of gingival lesions in noma patients.
AB  - Noma (cancrum oris) is a gangrenous disease of unknown etiology affecting the maxillo-facial region of young children in extremely limited resource countries. In an attempt to better understand the microbiological events occurring during this disease, we used phylogenetic and low-density microarrays targeting the 16S rRNA gene to characterize the gingival flora of acute noma and acute necrotizing gingivitis (ANG) lesions, and compared them to healthy control subjects of the same geographical and social background. Our observations raise doubts about Fusobacterium necrophorum, a previously suspected causative agent of noma, as this species was not associated with noma lesions. Various oral pathogens were more abundant in noma lesions, notably Atopobium spp., Prevotella intermedia, Peptostreptococcus spp., Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus anginosus. On the other hand, pathogens associated with periodontal diseases such as Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Capnocytophaga spp., Porphyromonas spp. and Fusobacteriales were more abundant in healthy controls. Importantly, the overall loss of bacterial diversity observed in noma samples as well as its homology to that of ANG microbiota supports the hypothesis that ANG might be the immediate step preceding noma.
TI  - No evidence of triclosan-resistant bacteria following long-term use of triclosan-containing toothpaste.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: There is a paucity of data in relation to the possible  emergence of triclosan (TCS)-resistant bacteria following long-term exposure to TCS toothpaste. Therefore, this study investigated whether long-term continuous exposure to TCS in toothpaste selects for TCS-resistant bacteria within the oral biofilm. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Dental plaque samples were collected from 40 individuals during year 5 of a randomised controlled trial. Participants had been randomly assigned to use TCS (3000 mug/mL TCS) (n = 18) or placebo toothpaste (n = 22). Diluted plaque samples were plated on to Wilkins-Chalgren agar plates containing 5% (v/v) laked sheep red blood cells and TCS (concentrations ranging from 25 to 150 mug/mL) and incubated at 37 degrees C under microaerophilic and anaerobic conditions for 2-10 d. Selected bacterial isolates were identified by partial 16S rDNA sequencing and TCS minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) determined for each isolate. RESULTS: At 3000 mug/mL TCS no growth was observed under microaerophilic or anaerobic conditions in either group. The MICs of TCS for all isolates ranged from 125 to 1000 mug/mL in both groups. Species common to both groups had similar MICs. Veillonella parvula and Campylobacter gracilis were the most frequent isolates from both groups, with similar MICs in both groups. CONCLUSION: The use of TCS-containing toothpaste did not appear to lead to an increase in MIC of TCS of oral bacterial isolates.
TI  - Mechanical non-surgical treatment of peri-implantitis: a single-blinded randomized longitudinal clinical study. II. Microbiological results.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Peri-implantitis is common in patients with dental implants. We performed a single-blinded longitudinal randomized study to assess the effects of mechanical debridement on the peri-implant microbiota in peri-implantitis lesions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An expanded checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization assay encompassing 79 different microorganisms was used to study bacterial counts before and during 6 months following mechanical treatment of peri-implantitis in 17 cases treated with curettes and 14 cases treated with an ultrasonic device. Statistics included non-parametric tests and GLM multivariate analysis with p<0001 indicating significance and 80% power. RESULTS: At selected implant test sites, the most prevalent bacteria were: Fusobacterium nucleatum sp., Staphylococci sp., Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Helicobacter pylori, and Tannerella forsythia. 30 min. after treatment with curettes, A. actinomycetemcomitans (serotype a), Lactobacillus acidophilus, Streptococcus anginosus, and Veillonella parvula were found at lower counts (p<0.001). No such differences were found for implants treated with the ultrasonic device. Inconsistent changes occurred following the first week. No microbiological differences between baseline and 6-month samples were found for any species or between treatment study methods in peri-implantitis. CONCLUSIONS: Both methods failed to eliminate or reduce bacterial counts in peri-implantitis. No group differences were found in the ability to reduce the microbiota in peri-implantitis.
TI  - Does pregnancy have an impact on the subgingival microbiota?
AB  - BACKGROUND: We investigated clinical and subgingival microbiologic changes during pregnancy in 20 consecutive pregnant women > or =18 years not receiving dental care. METHODS: Bacterial samples from weeks 12, 28, and 36 of pregnancy and at 4 to 6 weeks postpartum were processed for 37 species by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Clinical periodontal data were collected at week 12 and at 4 to 6 weeks postpartum, and bleeding on probing (BOP) was recorded at sites sampled at the four time points. RESULTS: The mean BOP at week 12 and postpartum was 40.1% +/- 18.2% and 27.4% +/- 12.5%, respectively. The corresponding mean BOP at microbiologic test sites was 15% (week 12) and 21% (postpartum; not statistically significant). Total bacterial counts decreased between week 12 and postpartum (P <0.01). Increased bacterial counts over time were found for Neisseria mucosa (P <0.001). Lower counts (P <0.001) were found for Capnocytophaga ochracea, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Eubacterium saburreum, Fusobacterium nucleatum naviforme, Fusobacterium nucleatum polymorphum, Leptotrichia buccalis, Parvimonas micra (previously Peptostreptococcus micros or Micromonas micros), Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella melaninogenica, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus sanguinis, Selenomonas noxia, and Veillonella parvula. No changes occurred between weeks 12 and 28 of pregnancy. Counts of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia (previously T. forsythensis), and Treponema denticola did not change. Counts of P. gingivalis and T. forsythia at week 12 were associated with gingivitis (P <0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Subgingival levels of bacteria associated with periodontitis did not change. P. gingivalis and T. forsythia counts were associated with BOP at week 12. A decrease was found in 17 of 37 species from week 12 to postpartum. Only counts of N. mucosa increased.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Mahonia aquifolium and two of its alkaloids against oral bacteria.
AB  - Extracts or alkaloids isolated from Mahonia aquifolium exhibit antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, fungi, and protozoa. In this study the bacteriostatic and bacteriocidal activities of a M. aquifolium extract and two of its major alkaloids, berberine chloride and oxyacanthine sulphate, were tested in vitro against nine different oral bacteria. Minimum inhibitory concentrations were in the range from < or = 0.0031% to 0.1993% for the M. aquifolium extract, from 0.002% to > 0.125% for berberine chloride, and from 0.0156% to > 0.0625% for oxyacanthine sulphate. The values for the minimum bactericidal concentrations were in the same range, indicating that the test substances most probably acted in a bactericidal manner. The most susceptible bacterium against all three test substances was Porphyromonas gingivalis.
TI  - Microbiological composition associated with interleukin-1 gene polymorphism in subjects undergoing supportive periodontal therapy.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Interleukin-1 gene polymorphism (IL-1 gene) has been associated with  periodontitis. The present study examined the subgingival microbiota by IL-1 gene status in subjects undergoing supportive periodontal therapy (SPT). METHODS: A total of 151 subjects with known IL-1 gene status (IL-1A +4845/IL-1B -3954) (IL-1 gene) were included in this study. Clinical data and subgingival plaque samples (40 taxa) were collected. These taxa were determined by the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization method. RESULTS: Gender, smoking habits (n-par tests), age, and clinical periodontal conditions did not differ by IL-1 gene status. IL-1 gene-negative subjects had a higher total bacterial load (mean difference, 480.4 x 10(5); 95% confidence interval [CI], 77 to 884 x 10(5); P <0.02). The levels of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (mean difference, 30.7 x 10(5); 95% CI, 2.2 to 59.5 x 10(5); P <0.05), Eubacterium nodatum (mean difference, 4.2 x 10(5); 95% CI, 0.6 to 7.8 x 10(5); P <0.02), Porphyromonas gingivalis (mean difference, 17.9 x 10(5); 95% CI, 1.2 to 34.5 x 10(5); P <0.05), and Streptococcus anginosus (mean difference, 4.0 x 10(5); 95% CI, 0.2 to 7.2 x 10(5); P <0.05) were higher in IL-1 gene-negative subjects, an observation specifically found at sites with probing depths <5.0 mm. CONCLUSIONS: Bleeding on probing did not differ by IL gene status, reflecting clinical SPT efficacy. IL-1 gene-negative subjects had higher levels of periodontal pathogens. This may suggest that among subjects undergoing SPT, a lower bacterial load is required in IL-1 gene-positive subjects to develop the same level of periodontitis as in IL-1 gene-negative subjects.
TI  - The efficacy of povidone-iodine products against periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  - A total of 8 strains of 6 bacterial species, Porphyromonas gingivalis ATCC33277 and TDC286, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans ATCC29523 and JP2, Fusobacterium nucleatum No. 2, Tannerella forsythensis ATCC43937, Prevotella intermedia ATCC25611 and Streptococcus anginosus ATCC33397, were treated with povidone-iodine (PVP-I) gargle (PVP-I: 0.47 and 0.23% w/v) or chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) gargle (CHG: 0.002% w/v) for 15, 30 or 60 s, after which they were inoculated into various media, cultured and counted for residual bacteria. At both concentrations, PVP-I gargle reduced the viable cell count of all 8 bacterial strains to below the measurable limit within 15 s. By contrast, there were more than 1,000 viable colonies 60 s following treatment with the CHG gargle. The results demonstrate that povidone-iodine gargle has rapid bactericidal activity against the causative bacteria of periodontal disease.
TI  - Microbial profile on metallic and ceramic bracket materials.
AB  - The placement of orthodontic appliances creates a favorable environment for the accumulation of a microbiota and food residues, which, in time, may cause caries or exacerbate any pre-existing periodontal disease. The purpose of the present study was to compare the total bacterial counts present on metallic and ceramic orthodontic brackets in order to clarify which bracket type has a higher plaque retaining capacity and to determine the levels of Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus spp on both types of brackets. Thirty-two metallic brackets and 24 ceramic brackets were collected from orthodontic patients at the day of debonding. Two brackets were collected from each patient; one from a maxillary central incisor and another from a maxillary second premolar. Sixteen patients who used metallic brackets and 12 patients who used ceramic brackets were sampled. Bacterial populations were studied using "checkerboard" DNA-DNA hybridization, which uses DNA probes to identify species in complex microbial samples. The significance of differences between groups was determined using the Mann-Whitney U-test. Results showed no significant differences between metallic and ceramic brackets with respect to the caries-inducing S mutans and L acidophilus spp counts. Mean counts of 8 of 35 additional species differed significantly between metallic and ceramic brackets with no obvious pattern favoring one bracket type over the other. This study showed higher mean counts of Treponema denticola, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum ss vincentii, Streptococcus anginosus, and Eubacterium nodatum on metallic brackets while higher counts of Eikenella corrodens, Campylobacter showae, and Selenomonas noxia were found on ceramic brackets.
TI  - Salivary microbiota levels in relation to periodontal status, experience of caries and miswak use in Sudanese adults.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the present investigation was to assess the salivary levels of 25 oral bacteria in relation to periodontal status and experience of caries, and to compare the levels of these bacteria between habitual miswak and toothbrush users in adult Sudanese subjects. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study subjects consisted of 56 individuals with age range 19-53 years (mean 35.2 years) and included 30 miswak and 26 toothbrush users. The periodontal status and presence of dental caries were assessed clinically. Whole saliva was collected from all subjects, and the levels of 25 selected bacterial species in saliva were assessed by the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization method using whole genomic DNA probes. RESULTS: A high percentage of the subjects had detectable levels (> or = 105 bacterial cells) of several bacterial species in saliva. Between 12% and 16% of the subjects showed high (> or = 106 cells) salivary levels of the periodontitis-associated bacteria A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. melaninogenica, P. intermedia, C. rectus and E. corrodens, whereas only two (3.6%) and four (7.1%) subjects had high levels of P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum, respectively. There were no significant differences in the levels of all or most bacterial species by age group, gender or periodontal status. Presence of > or = 105 L. acidophilus bacterial cells in saliva was associated with high caries scores (p = 0.02). There were significantly higher levels of A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. melaninogenica, C. rectus, P. micros, V. parvula, S. mutans, S. anginosus, A. israelii, C. sputigena, and C. gingivalis, and significantly lower levels of P. intermedia, F. nucleatum, S. sputigena, E. corrodens, L. acidophilus, S. sanguis, S. salivarius, S. oralis, and S. mitis in the miswak than in the toothbrush group. CONCLUSIONS: : The findings suggest that miswak may have a selective inhibitory effect on the level of certain bacteria in saliva, particularly several oral streptococci species. This is the first report that the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization method can be useful for assessing the levels of a wide range of bacterial taxa in saliva.
TI  - The antimicrobial activity of Prevention mouthrinse.
AB  - Prevention mouthrinse was designed to serve as a vital supplement to normal oral  hygiene procedures. To determine the antimicrobial potency of this mouthrinse, minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs), bactericidal kinetics, and short-term exposure studies were conducted. A spectrum of oral microorganisms was employed in this investigation: Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus mutans, Actinomyces viscosus, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Eikenella corrodens, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Serratia marcescens and Candida albicans. Microorganisms were cultured in standard enriched media and under appropriate atmospheric conditions. Inhibition assays were conducted in tubes, with each mouthrinse dilution assayed in triplicate. MIC determinations revealed that all of the microorganisms studied were highly susceptible to Prevention mouthrinse, with MICs ranging from 16-fold to 128-fold dilutions. Bactericidal kinetics assays showed rapid killing of the test organisms in the presence of the mouthrinse. Brief (5-minute) exposure of S. mutans to 8-fold diluted mouthrinse resulted in a substantial delay in growth. Under the constraints of this type of study, Prevention mouthrinse exhibited potent antimicrobial activity against all of the microorganisms studied. We support the notion that Prevention mouthrinse may be a valuable supplement to normal oral hygiene procedures. A 6-month clinical trial assessing the in vivo efficacy of Prevention mouthrinse is currently being conducted.
