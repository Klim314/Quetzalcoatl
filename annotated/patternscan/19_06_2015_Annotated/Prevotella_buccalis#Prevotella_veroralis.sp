TI  == new findings on the microbial flora associated with adult periodontitis.
AB  == the predominant microbial flora associated with adult periodontitis was investigated in 21 patients aged 20-40 years. microorganisms from samples of subgingival plaque were cultured on selective and non-selective media under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. ten species or groups out of a total of 31 were found to comprise the predominant cultivable flora: diphtheroids, porphyromonas asaccharolytica, coagulase-negative staphylococci, 'streptococcus milleri'-group, bacteroides ureolyticus, capnocytophaga ochracea, the prevotella veroralis/buccalis complex, p. intermedia, p. oralis and unidentified prevotella  spp. two species previously reported at periodontitis sites, namely p. gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum, were not isolated, whereas prevotella species accounted for the majority of isolates in this investigation. the large proportion of non-pigmented prevotella species, p. asaccharolytica and b. ureolyticus that were found have not generally been reported previously. the role of these microorganisms and also coagulase-negative staphylococci, diphtheroids and the 'streptococcus milleri'-group requires further investigation in adult periodontitis.

TI  == effects of root planing on the distribution of microorganisms adult periodontitis sites.
AB  == the aims of this study were to identify the microbial species present in subgingival plaque in patients with adult periodontitis, and to investigate the effects of root planing upon the microbial flora for 12 months following root planing. microorganisms from samples of subgingival plaque obtained from adult periodontitis sites in 15 patients were cultured, both aerobically and anaerobically, on a variety of media and identified. prevotella intermedia and porphyromonas asaccharolytica were the most frequently identified species before  treatment. bacteroides ureolyticus, the prevotella veroralis/buccalis complex and other microorganisms including capnocytophaga ochracea, species of streptococci,  staphylococci and diphtheroids were also frequently isolated. root planing improved periodontal health, and was accompanied by reductions in the frequencies with which p. intermedia, p. asaccharolytica, the p. veroralis/buccalis complex and c. ochracea were isolated. regular scaling and oral hygiene reviews maintained the clinical improvements and balance in favour of beneficial microbial species during the study.

TI  == emended descriptions of prevotella denticola, prevotella loescheii, prevotella veroralis, and prevotella melaninogenica.
AB  == during studies of human periodontal disease, a number of bacterial strains were encountered that, on the basis of results of standard biochemical tests, appeared to be prevotella buccalis, prevotella denticola, prevotella melaninogenica, or prevotella loescheii. however, use of the standard biochemical tests, cellular fatty acid analyses, and the polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis patterns of soluble proteins resulted in conflicting identifications of these strains. the results of tests for cellobiose fermentation, inulin fermentation, and pigment production were responsible for most of the discordant results. cellular fatty acid analyses in which the microbial identification system was used did not differentiate these strains from validly described species, even though separate  library entries were created for them. dna reassociation determinations in which  the s1 nuclease procedure was used showed that cellobiose fermentation and pigment production are variable among strains of p. melaninogenica and p. denticola and that fermentation of xylan is not a reliable characteristic for differentiating p. buccalis from prevotella veroralis. in contrast to previous indications, most strains of p. veroralis do not ferment xylan. these species can be differentiated by dna-dna reassociation and by cellular fatty acid analysis, using the microbial identification system, but differentiation by currently described phenotypic characteristics is not reliable. similarly, p. loescheii and the genetically distinct (but closely related) d1c-20 group cannot be distinguished reliably from each other or from p. veroralis, p. denticola, and p. melaninogenica on the basis of currently described phenotypic tests other than cellular fatty acid composition or, for some species, electrophoretic patterns of soluble whole-cell proteins.

TI  == characterisation of non-pigmented species of the genus prevotella by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
AB  == gram-negative anaerobic bacilli previously known as the melaninogenicus-oralis group of bacteroides have been assigned to a new genus, prevotella. the non-pigmented members of this genus share several general characteristics and cannot be readily distinguished by routine tests. a polyacrylamide slab gel electrophoresis procedure, with visual analysis of protein patterns, was used to  compare cellular protein patterns from clinical isolates with those from collection (reference) strains. reference strains of p. oralis, p. veroralis, p.  buccalis, p. oris, p. buccae, p. zoogleoformans, p. bivia, p. disiens, p. oulora, b. (p.) capillus and b. (p.) pentosaceus, and 91 non-pigmented isolates from patients with adult periodontal disease were examined by conventional biochemical tests, gas-liquid chromatography (glc) and enzyme tests, and whole-cell protein profiles were obtained by sds-page. there was close correlation between patterns  of results in biochemical and glc tests and the sds-page profiles, and the species were readily distinguished in sds-page. the periodontal isolates were assigned to 10 groups by conventional test reaction patterns and nine groups by sds-page; the profiles of 79 isolates corresponded to those of seven species reference strains. by sds-page, clinical isolates of p. buccae (42 isolates) and  p. oralis (eight isolates) showed good similarity with reference strains. however, for p. veroralis (15), p. oris (7), p. bivia (4), p. zoogleoformans (2)  and p. buccalis (1), clinical isolates showed some minor variations from reference strains. twelve isolates remained undesignated in sds-page analysis. variant sds-page profiles divided clinical isolates of p. buccae into two subgroups and those of p. veroralis into five subgroups.

TI  == use of the rapid-ana system to screen for enzyme activities that differ among species of bile-inhibited bacteroides.
AB  == the rapid-ana system (innovative diagnostics systems, inc., atlanta, ga.) was used to test 102 strains of 14 species of phenotypically similar bile-inhibited bacteroides from humans. bacteroides oris, bacteroides veroralis, bacteroides buccalis, bacteroides melaninogenicus, bacteroides loescheii, and bacteroides denticola had very similar enzyme activity profiles. clear differentiation of these six species by the rapid-ana system was not possible, but tests for arginine aminopeptidase and beta-glucosidase were helpful. bacteroides oralis, bacteroides intermedius, bacteroides corporis, bacteroides disiens, bacteroides bivius, bacteroides gingivalis, bacteroides asaccharolyticus, and bacteroides buccae each had unique enzyme activity profiles. no consistent differences in enzyme activities were found between the two dna homology groups within bacteroides melaninogenicus, bacteroides loescheii, or bacteroides intermedius. tests for glycine aminopeptidase, alpha-galactosidase, arginine aminopeptidase, alpha-fucosidase, n-acetylglucosaminidase, reduction of triphenyltetrazolium, and production of indole were helpful in the differentiation of the species studied.
