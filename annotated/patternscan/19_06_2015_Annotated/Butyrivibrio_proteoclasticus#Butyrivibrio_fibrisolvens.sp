TI  == milk fatty acid composition, rumen microbial population, and animal performances  in response to diets rich in linoleic acid supplemented with chestnut or quebracho tannins in dairy ewes.
AB  == the aim of the study was to evaluate milk fatty acid (fa) profile, animal performance, and rumen microbial population in response to diets containing soybean oil supplemented or not with chestnut and quebracho tannins in dairy ewes. eighteen comisana ewes at 122+/-6 d in milking were allotted into 3 experimental groups. diets were characterized by chopped grass hay administered ad libitum and by 800 g/head and day of 3 experimental concentrates containing 84.5 g of soybean oil/kg of dry matter (dm) and 52.8 g/kg of dm of bentonite (control diet), chestnut tannin extract (cht diet), or quebracho tannin extract (que diet). the trial lasted 4 wk. milk yield was recorded daily, and milk composition and blood parameters were analyzed weekly. at the end of the experiment, samples of rumen fluid were collected to analyze ph, volatile fatty acid profile, and the relative proportions of butyrivibrio fibrisolvens and butyrivibrio proteoclasticus in the rumen microbial population. hepatic functionality, milk yield, and gross composition were not affected by tannin extracts, whereas milk fa composition was characterized by significant changes in the concentration of linoleic acid (cht +2.77% and que +9.23%), vaccenic acid (cht +7.07% and que +13.88%), rumenic acid (cht -1.88% and que +24.24%), stearic  acid (cht + 8.71% and que -11.45%), and saturated fatty acids (cht -0.47% and que -3.38%). these differences were probably due to the ability of condensed versus hydrolyzable tannins to interfere with rumen microbial metabolism, as indirectly  confirmed by changes in the relative proportions of b. fibrisolvens and b. proteoclasticus populations and by changes in the molar proportions of volatile fatty acids. the effect of the cht diet on the milk fa profile and microbial species considered in this trial was intermediate between that of que and the control diet, suggesting a differential effect of condensed and hydrolyzable tannins on rumen microbes. compared with control animals, the presence of b. fibrisolvens increased about 3 times in ewes fed cht and about 5 times in animals fed que. in contrast, the abundance of b. proteoclasticus decreased about 5- and  15-fold in rumen liquor of ewes fed cht and que diets, respectively. the use of soybean oil and a practical dose of que or cht extract in the diet of dairy ewes  can be an efficient strategy to improve the nutritional quality of milk.

TI  == diversity of butyrivibrio group bacteria in the rumen of goats and its response to the supplementation of garlic oil.
AB  == this study aimed to investigate the diversity of the butyrivibrio group bacteria  in goat rumen and its response to garlic oil (go) supplementation as revealed by  molecular analysis of cloned 16s rrna genes. six wethers fitted with ruminal fistulas were assigned to two groups for a cross-over design with 28-d experimental period and 14-d interval. goats were fed a basal diet without (control) or with go ruminal infusion (0.8 g/d). ruminal contents were used for dna extraction collected before morning feeding on d 28. a total bacterial clone  library was firstly constructed by nearly full-length 16s rrna gene cloned sequences using universal primers. the resulting plasmids selected by butyrivibrio-specific primers were used to construct a butyrivibrio group-specific bacterial clone library. butyrivibrio group represented 12.98% and 10.95% of total bacteria in control and go group, respectively. in libraries, clones were classified to the genus pseudobutyrivibrio, butyrivibrio and others within the family lachnospiraceae. additionally, some specific clones were observed in go group, being classified to the genus ruminococcus and others within the family ruminococcaceae. based on the criterion that the similarity was 97% or greater with database sequences, there were 29.73% and 18.42% of clones identified as known isolates (i.e. b. proteoclasticus and ps. ruminis) in control and go groups, respectively. further clones identified as b. fibrisolvens (5.41%) and r. flavefaciens (7.89%) were specifically found in control and go groups, respectively. the majority of clones resembled ps. ruminis (98% to 99% similarity), except for lachnospiraceae bacteria (87% to 92% similarity) in the two libraries. the two clone libraries also appeared different in shannon diversity index (control 2.47 and go group 2.91). our results indicated that the  butyrivibrio group bacteria had a complex community with considerable unknown species in the goat rumen.

TI  == effects of pistachio by-products in replacement of alfalfa hay on populations of  rumen bacteria involved in biohydrogenation and fermentative parameters in the rumen of sheep.
AB  == the objective of this study was to investigate the effect of sundried pistachio by-products (pbp) as a replacement of alfalfa hay (ah) on blood metabolites, rumen fermentation and populations of rumen bacteria involved in biohydrogenation (bh) in baluchi sheep. four adult male baluchi sheep (41 +/- 1.3 kg, bw) fitted with ruminal cannulae were randomly assigned to four experimental diets in a 4 x  4 latin square design. the dietary treatments were as follows: (i) control, (ii)  12% pbp (0.33 of ah in basal diet replaced by pbp), (iii) 24% pbp (0.66 of ah in  basal diet replaced by pbp) and (iv) 36% pbp (all of ah in basal diet replaced by pbp). the basal diet was 360 g/kg dry matter (dm) alfalfa hay, 160 g/kg dm wheat  straw and 480 g/kg dm concentrate. the trial consisted of four periods, each composed of 16 days adaptation and 4 days data collection including measurement of blood metabolites, rumen fermentation and population of bacteria. no differences were observed in rumen ph among the treatments, while rumen ammonia-n concentrations were decreased (p< 0.05) with increasing pbp by up to 36% dm of the diets. using of 36% pbp in the diet reduced (p < 0.05) total volatile fatty acids (vfa) concentrations and the molar proportion of acetate, while the concentration of propionate, butyrate and acetate to propionate ratio were similar to all other treatments. the concentration of blood urea nitrogen (bun) decreased (p < 0.01) with increasing pbp by up to 36% dm in the diets of sheep. however, other blood metabolites were not affected by the experimental diets. it  was concluded that pbp in replacement of ah had no effects on the relative abundance of butyrivibrio fibrisolvens and butyrivibrio proteoclasticus in relation to the control diet.

TI  == effects of incremental amounts of fish oil on trans fatty acids and butyrivibrio  bacteria in continuous culture fermenters.
AB  == previous studies have shown that adding fish oil (fo) to ruminant animal diets increased vaccenic acid (va; t11 c18:1) accumulation in the rumen. therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of dietary fo amounts on selected strains of rumen bacteria involved in biohydrogenation. a single-flow continuous culture system consisting of four fermenters was used in a 4 x 4 latin square design with four 9 days consecutive periods. treatment diets were as follows: (i) control diet (53:47 forage to concentrate; con), (ii) control plus fo at 0.5% (dm basis; fol), (iii) control plus fo at 2% (dm basis; fom) and (iv)  control plus fo at 3.5% (dm basis; foh). fermenters were fed treatment diets three times daily at 120 g/day. samples were collected from each fermenter on day 9 of each period at 1.5, 3 and 6 h post-morning feeding and then composited into  one sample per fermenter. increasing dietary fo amounts resulted in a linear decrease in acetate and isobutyrate concentrations and a linear decrease in acetate-to-propionate ratio. propionate, butyrate, valerate and isovalerate concentrations were not affected by fo supplementation. concentrations of c18:0 in fermenters linearly decreased, while concentrations of t10 c18:1 and va linearly increased as dietary fo amounts increased. the concentrations of c9t11 and t10c12 conjugated linoleic acid were not affected by fo supplementation. the  dna abundance for butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, butyrivibrio vaccenic acid subgroup, butyrivibrio stearic acid subgroup and butyrivibrio proteoclasticus linearly decreased as dietary fo amounts increased. in conclusion, fo effects on trans fatty acid accumulation in the rumen may be explained in part by fo influence on  butyrivibrio group.

TI  == ricinoleic acid inhibits methanogenesis and fatty acid biohydrogenation in ruminal digesta from sheep and in bacterial cultures.
AB  == ricinoleic acid (ra; 12-hydroxy-cis-9-18:1) is the main fatty acid component of castor oil. although a precursor for cla synthesis in lactic acid bacteria, ra was found previously not to form cla in ruminal digesta but to have some inhibitory properties. the present study was undertaken to evaluate the potential of ra to modulate ruminal biohydrogenation and methanogenesis. ruminal digesta from 4 sheep receiving a mixed hay-concentrate diet was incubated in vitro with 0.167 g/l of linoleic acid (la; cis-9,cis-12-18:2) or with a combination of la and ra or la and castor oil (la, ra, and castor oil added to a final concentration of 0.167 g/l) in the presence and absence of lipase. the cla rumenic acid (cis-9,trans-11-18:2) accumulated when either ra or castor oil and lipase was present. vaccenic acid (va; trans-11-18:1) also accumulated, and a decrease of the rate of production of stearic acid (sa; 18:0) was observed. when  la was incubated with castor oil in the absence of lipase, no effects on biohydrogenation were observed. ricinoleic acid at 0.02 g/l did not affect growth of butyrivibrio fibrisolvens but it inhibited growth of butyrivibrio proteoclasticus. butyrivibrio proteoclasticus but not b. fibrisolvens metabolized ra to 12-hydroxystearate. linoleic acid metabolism by b. proteoclasticus appeared to be unaffected by ra addition whereas rumenic acid accumulation increased (p =  0.015 at 12 h) when ra was added. a 28% decrease (p = 0.004) in methane was obtained in 24 h in vitro incubations of diluted buffered ruminal fluid with added 0.2 g ra/l. there was no effect on the total concentration of vfa after 24  h as a result of ra addition, but the molar proportions of acetate and butyrate were decreased (p = 0.041 and p < 0.001, respectively) whereas that of propionate increased (p < 0.001). it was concluded that, at least in vitro, ra or the combination of castor oil and lipase inhibit biohydrogenation, causing the accumulation of rumenic acid and va, with potential health benefits for ruminant  products. the effect appeared to be mediated via an inhibitory effect on the biohydrogenating activity of b. proteoclasticus. an added environmental benefit could be a concomitant decrease in methane emissions. in vivo studies are now required to confirm the potential of these additives.

TI  == the effect of lipid supplements on ruminal bacteria in continuous culture fermenters varies with the fatty acid composition.
AB  == a single flow continuous culture fermenter system was used in this study to investigate the influence of dietary lipid supplements varying in their fatty acid content on the dna concentration of selected rumen bacteria. four continuous culture fermenters were used in a 4 x 4 latin square design with four periods of  10 d each. treatment diets were fed at 45 g/d (dm basis) in three equal portions  during the day. the diets were: 1) control (con), 2) control with animal fat source (sat), 3) control with soybean oil (sbo), and 4) control with fish oil (fo). lipid supplements were added at 3% of diet dm. the concentrations of total  volatile fatty acids and acetate were not affected (p>0.05) by lipid supplements. concentrations of propionate, iso-butyrate, valerate and iso-valerate were highest (p<0.05) with the fo diet compared with the other treatment diets. the concentration of til c18:l (vaccenic acid, va) in effluents increased (p<0.05) with sbo and fo diets and was highest with the sbo diet. the concentrations of c18:0 in effluents were lowest (p<0.05) for the fo diet compared with the other treatment diets. concentrations of dna for anaerovibrio lipolytica, and butyrivibrio proteoclasticus in fermenters were similar (p>0.05) for all diets. the dna concentrations of butyrivibrio fibrisolvens and ruminococcus albus in fermenters were lowest (p<0.05) with the fo diet but were similar (p>0.05) among  the other treatment diets. selenomonas ruminantium dna concentration in fermenters was highest (p<0.05) with the fo diet. in conclusion, sbo had no effect on bacterial dna concentrations tested in this study and the va accumulation in the rumen observed on the fo diet may be due in part to fo influence on b. fibrisolvens, r. albus, and s. ruminantium.

TI  == bacterial and protozoal communities and fatty acid profile in the rumen of sheep  fed a diet containing added tannins.
AB  == this study evaluated the effects of tannins on ruminal biohydrogenation (bh) due  to shifts in the ruminal microbial environment in sheep. thirteen lambs (45 days  of age) were assigned to two dietary treatments: seven lambs were fed a barley-based concentrate (control group) while the other six lambs received the same concentrate with supplemental quebracho tannins (9.57% of dry matter). at 122 days of age, the lambs were slaughtered, and the ruminal contents were subjected to fatty acid analysis and sampled to quantify populations of butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, which converts c(18:2) c9-c12 (linoleic acid [la]) to  c(18:2) c9-t11 (rumenic acid [ra]) and then ra to c(18:1) t11 (vaccenic acid [va]); we also sampled for butyrivibrio proteoclasticus, which converts va to c(18:0) (stearic acid [sa]). tannins increased (p < 0.005) va in the rumen compared to the tannin-free diet. the concentration of sa was not affected by tannins. the sa/va ratio was lower (p < 0.005) for the tannin-fed lambs than for  the controls, suggesting that the last step of the bh process was inhibited by tannins. the b. proteoclasticus population was lower (-30.6%; p < 0.1), and b. fibrisolvens and protozoan populations were higher (+107% and +56.1%, respectively; p < 0.05) in the rumen of lambs fed the tannin-supplemented diet than in controls. these results suggest that quebracho tannins altered bh by changing ruminal microbial populations.

TI  == metabolism of conjugated linoleic acids and 18 : 1 fatty acids by ruminal bacteria: products and mechanisms.
AB  == cultures of ruminal bacteria known to metabolize unsaturated fatty acids were grown in medium containing 50 microg ml(-1) of geometric and positional isomers of conjugated linoleic acid (cla) or 18 : 1 fatty acids and 37.4 % deuterium oxide to investigate the mechanisms responsible for fatty acid metabolism. butyrivibrio fibrisolvens jw11 converted cis-9,trans-11-18 : 2 and trans-9,trans-11-18 : 2 to trans-11-18 : 1 as the main product, labelled at c-9,  and metabolized trans-10,cis-12-18 : 2 to trans-10-18 : 1, labelled at c-13, and  smaller amounts of trans-12-18 : 1 and cis-12-18 : 1. butyrivibrio proteoclasticus p-18 did not grow in the presence of cis-9,trans-11-18 : 2 or trans-10,cis-12-18 : 2, but grew in medium containing trans-9,trans-11-18 : 2, forming 18 : 0. propionibacterium acnes, a ruminal species that isomerizes linoleic acid to trans-10,cis-12-18 : 2, did not metabolize cla isomers further.  b. fibrisolvens metabolized small amounts of trans-10-18 : 1, trans-11-18 : 1 and cis-9-18 : 1, but the products formed were not detected. b. proteoclasticus, on the other hand, carried out substantial conversion of 18 : 1 substrates to 18 : 0. p. acnes hydrated cis-9-18 : 1 and trans-11-18 : 1 to 10-oh-18 : 0, which was  further oxidized to yield 10-o-18 : 0. the deuterium enrichment in the intermediates formed during incubations with 9,11 geometric isomers of cla was about half that of the products from trans-10,cis-12 cla and 18 : 1 isomers, suggesting that the reduction of 9,11 geometric isomers cla by ruminal bacteria occurs via different mechanisms compared with the metabolism of other unsaturated fatty acids.
