TI == commensal bacteria modulate innate immune responses of vaginal epithelial cell multilayer cultures.
AB == the human vaginal microbiome plays a critical but poorly defined role in reproductive health. vaginal microbiome alterations are associated with increased susceptibility to sexually-transmitted infections (sti) possibly due to related changes in innate defense responses from epithelial cells. study of the impact of commensal bacteria on the vaginal mucosal surface has been hindered by current vaginal epithelial cell (vec) culture systems that lack an appropriate interface between the apical surface of stratified squamous epithelium and the air-filled vaginal lumen. therefore we developed a reproducible multilayer vec culture system with an apical (luminal) air-interface that supported colonization with selected commensal bacteria. multilayer vec developed tight-junctions and other hallmarks of the vaginal mucosa including predictable proinflammatory cytokine secretion following tlr stimulation. colonization of multilayers by common vaginal commensals including lactobacillus crispatus, l. jensenii, and l. rhamnosus led to intimate associations with the vec exclusively on the apical surface. vaginal commensals did not trigger cytokine secretion but staphylococcus epidermidis, a skin commensal, was inflammatory. lactobacilli reduced cytokine secretion in an isolate-specific fashion following tlr stimulation. this tempering of inflammation offers a potential explanation for increased susceptibility to sti in the absence of common commensals and has implications for testing of potential sti preventatives.

TI == inhibition of staphylococcus aureus by the commensal bacteria of human milk.
AB == aims: to study the bacterial diversity in expressed human milk with a focus on detecting bacteria with an antimicrobial activity against staphylococcus aureus, known as a causative agent of maternal breast infections and neonatal infections. methods and results: random isolates (n = 509) were collected from breast milk samples (n = 40) of healthy lactating women, genotypically identified, and tested for antimicrobial activity against staph. aureus. commensal staphylococci (64%) and oral streptococci (30%), with staph. epidermidis, strep. salivarius, and strep. mitis as the most frequent isolates, were the predominant bacterial species in breast milk. one-fifth of staph. epidermidis and half of strep. salivarius isolates suppressed growth of staph. aureus. enterococci (ent. faecalis), isolated from 7.5% of samples, and lactic acid bacteria (lab) (lactobacillus rhamnosus, lact. crispatus, lactococcus lactis, leuconoctoc mesenteroides), isolated from 12.5% of samples, were also effective against staph. aureus. one l. lactis isolate was shown to produce nisin, a bacteriocin used in food industry to prevent bacterial pathogens and spoilage. conclusions: expressed breast milk contains commensal bacteria, which inhibit staph. aureus. significance and impact of the study: the strains inhibitory against the pathogen staph. aureus have potential use as bacteriotherapeutic agents in preventing neonatal and maternal breast infections caused by this bacterium.
