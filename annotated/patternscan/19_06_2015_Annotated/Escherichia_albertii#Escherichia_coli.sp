TI  == escherichia marmotae sp. nov., isolated from feces of marmota himalayana in qinghai-tibet plateau china.
AB  == the taxonomic position of a group of seven closely related lactose-negative enterobacterial strains, which were isolated from fresh fecal samples of marmota  himalayana collected from the qinghai-tibetan plateau, china, was determined by a polyphasic approach. cells are gram negative, non-sporulating, non-motile, short  rods (0.5-1x1-2.5 mum). by 16s rrna gene sequences, the representative strain, ht073016, showed highest similarity values with e. fergusonii_atcc35469 at 99.3%, e. coli atcc_11775 at 99.2%, e. albertii lmg_20976t at 98.9%, e. hermannii cip_103176 at 98.4%, and e. vulneris atcc_33821 at 97.7%. phylogenetic analysis based on the 16s rrna gene sequences showed that the seven strains formed a monophyletic group with five other member species of the genus escherichia. digital dna-dna hybridization studies between strain ht073016 and five other species of the genus escherichia showed that it shared less than 70% dna-dna relatedness values with all known species of escherichia, supporting the novel species status of the strain. the g+c content of strain ht073016 was 53.8 mol%. on the basis of phenotypic and phylogenetic characteristics, strain ht073016 and  6 other ht073016-like strains were clearly distinct from the type strains of other recognized species of the genus escherichia and represent a novel species of the genus escherichia, for which the name escherichia marmotae sp. nov. is proposed, with ht073016 (=cgmcc 1.12862 =dsm 28771) as the type strain.

TI  == locus of enterocyte effacement: a pathogenicity island involved in the virulence  of enteropathogenic and enterohemorragic escherichia coli subjected to a complex  network of gene regulation.
AB  == the locus of enterocyte effacement (lee) is a 35.6 kb pathogenicity island inserted in the genome of some bacteria such as enteropathogenic escherichia coli, enterohemorrhagic e.coli, citrobacter rodentium, and escherichia albertii.  lee comprises the genes responsible for causing attaching and effacing lesions, a characteristic lesion that involves intimate adherence of bacteria to enterocytes, a signaling cascade leading to brush border and microvilli destruction, and loss of ions, causing severe diarrhea. it is composed of 41 open reading frames and five major operons encoding a type three system apparatus, secreted proteins, an adhesin, called intimin, and its receptor called translocated intimin receptor (tir). lee is subjected to various levels of regulation, including transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulators located  both inside and outside of the pathogenicity island. several molecules were described being related to feedback inhibition, transcriptional activation, and transcriptional repression. these molecules are involved in a complex network of  regulation, including mechanisms such as quorum sensing and temporal control of lee genes transcription and translation. in this mini review we have detailed the complex network that regulates transcription and expression of genes involved in  this kind of lesion.

TI  == evaluating the occurrence of escherichia albertii in chicken carcass rinses by pcr, vitek analysis, and sequencing of the rpob gene.
AB  == escherichia albertii is a recently described species that has been associated with gastroenteritis in humans and with healthy and ill birds. most recently, it  has been identified as the causative agent in a food-borne outbreak in japan. the distribution and clinical importance of e. albertii are not well studied because  its importance is unclear. culture methods for clinical isolation frequently miss e. albertii or incorrectly identify it as shigella spp., escherichia coli, or hafnia alvei. this study was designed to determine if e. albertii could be recovered from chicken carcass rinses collected at slaughter during a 1-year period from november 2009 until october 2010. colonies were isolated from chicken carcass rinses and tested by pcr for the presence or absence of clpx, lysp, mdh,  intimin (eae), shiga toxins 1 and 2 (stx1, stx2, and stx2f), heat-stable enterotoxin a (staa), and cytolethal distending toxins 1 and 2 (cdtb) genes. sixty-five isolates were analyzed by sequencing a section of the rpob gene. analysis of the rpob gene sequences revealed 14 fixed differences between e. albertii and other, closely related organisms. the fixed differences found in the rpob gene could aid in future discrimination of e. albertii from closely related  bacteria.

TI  == shiga toxin 2f-producing escherichia albertii from a symptomatic human.
AB  == the previously identified shiga toxin (stx) 2f-producing escherichia coli o115:hnm strain f08/101-31, isolated from a symptomatic human, was confirmed to be e. albertii in the present study by whole genome dna-dna hybridizations, by sequencing (cpn60, dnaj, and 16s rrna genes), and by multi-locus sequence typing. the f08/101-31 strain was originally identified as e. coli rather than the relatively new bacterial species e. albertii, which was first described in 2003,  because it did not display any of the biochemical characteristics of e. albertii. this new classification will impact public health management strategies in japan  because the present study showed that some e. albertii strains, which are often misidentified as e. coli, produce stx and likely cause diarrhea in humans. therefore, further guidelines for the management and identification of stx-producing e. albertii are required in japan.

TI  == characterization of escherichia fergusonii and escherichia albertii isolated from water.
AB  == aims: the aim of this study was to characterize escherichia fergusonii and escherichia albertii isolated from water. methods and results: the characterization of e. fergusonii and e. albertii isolated from water was determined using an escherichia coli-specific uida pcr, a tuf pcr, and with phylogenetic analysis using three housekeeping genes (adk, gyrb, and reca) from the e. coli mlst scheme, selected for their ability to discriminate among all escherichia species. among the 527 isolates tested, 25 (4.7%) were uida pcr negative and tuf pcr positive. phylogenetic analysis using adk, gyrb and reca genes showed that 6, 18 and 1 of these 25 non-e. coli escherichia spp. isolates grouped with reference strains of e. fergusonii, e. albertii, and e. coli, respectively. finally, the 25 non-e. coli escherichia spp. strains isolated were  investigated for the presence of pathogenic factors, comprising intimin (eae gene), cytolethal distending toxin (cdtb gene) and shiga toxin (stx gene). with the pcr primers used, the presence of eae and stx genes was not detected. however, cdtb genes types i/iv were detected for 3 (16.7%) e. albertii strains, whereas 15 of 18 (83.3%) possessed the cdtb gene types ii/iii/v. conclusions: these results showed that mlst scheme allows a more accurate identification of non-e. coli species than phenotypic tests. we also showed that e. fergusonii and  e. albertii represent, respectively, 0.8 and 2.5% of all escherichia species isolated and the pathogenic cdtb genes were present in 83.3% of these strains. significance and impact of the study: the data presented in this study provided an efficient way to correctly identify non-e. coli species contributing to our understanding of the risks associated with escherichia species in water consumed  by humans and animals. furthermore, the results give an insight about the natural habitats of these species.

TI  == molecular characterization of cytolethal distending toxin gene-positive escherichia coli from healthy cattle and swine in nara, japan.
AB  == background: cytolethal distending toxin (cdt)-producing escherichia coli (ctec) has been isolated from patients with gastrointestinal or urinary tract infection, and sepsis. however, the source of human infection remains unknown. in this study, we attempted to detect and isolate ctec strains from fecal specimens of healthy farm animals and characterized them phenotypically and genotypically. results: by pcr analysis, the cdtb gene was detected in 90 and 14 out of 102 and  45 stool specimens of healthy cattle and swine, respectively, and none from 45 chicken samples. subtypes of the cdtb genes (i to v) were further examined by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of the amplicons and by type-specific pcrs for the cdt-iii and cdt-v genes. of the 90 cdtb gene-positive  cattle samples, 2 cdt-i, 25 cdt-iii, 1 cdt-iv, 52 cdt-v and 1 both cdt-iii and cdt-v gene-positive strains were isolated while 1 cdt-ii and 6 cdt-v gene-positive were isolated from 14 cdtb positive swine samples. serotypes of some isolates were identical to those of human isolates. interestingly, a cdt-ii  gene-positive strain isolated from swine was for the first time identified as escherichia albertii. phylogenetic analysis grouped 87 e. coli strains into 77 phylogroup b1, 6 b2, and 4 d, respectively. most of the b1 strains harbored both  lpfao113 and ehaa. three and twenty-two cdt-v gene-positive strains harbored eaea and stx genes, respectively, and seven possessed cdt-v, stx and subab genes. the  cnf2 gene, normally present in cdt-iii gene-positive strains, was also detected in cdt-v gene-positive strains. conclusions: our results suggest that healthy cattle and swine could be the reservoir of ctec, and they could be a potential source of human infections.

TI  == escherichia albertii, a newly emerging enteric pathogen with poorly defined properties.
AB  == escherichia albertii is a newly emerging enteric pathogen that has been associated with sporadic infections among humans and birds. selected coliform isolates were screened for allelic variation in 2 housekeeping genes (lysp and mdh) specific for e. albertii. the 48 strains that were identified as e. albertii were tested for 15 virulence markers and biochemical and serogical properties. all e. albertii strains were non-motile, fermented d-glucose (with gas), d-mannitol, and d-mannose, but failed to ferment lactose and other sugars. variable positive reactions were noted for other tests. most strains were rough or failed to agglutinate with shigella boydii 13 antisera and e. coli antisera with few exceptions. all strains were positive for the eaea gene, and variable numbers were positive for the cdtb, phoe, ehxa, and stx2f genes. results illustrate the variability extent within this lineage and highlight the importance of accurately distinguishing it within the genus escherichia and including information within commercial databases to improve their identification.

TI  == a genomic island in salmonella enterica ssp. salamae provides new insights on the genealogy of the locus of enterocyte effacement.
AB  == the genomic island encoding the locus of enterocyte effacement (lee) is an important virulence factor of the human pathogenic escherichia coli. lee typically encodes a type iii secretion system (t3ss) and secreted effectors capable of forming attaching and effacing lesions. although prominent in the pathogenic e. coli such as serotype o157:h7, lee has also been detected in citrobacter rodentium, e. albertii, and although not confirmed, it is likely to also be in shigella boydii. previous phylogenetic analysis of lee indicated the genomic island was evolving through stepwise acquisition of various components. this study describes a new lee region from two strains of salmonella enterica subspecies salamae serovar sofia along with a phylogenetic analysis of lee that provides new insights into the likely evolution of this genomic island. the salmonella lee contains 36 of the 41 genes typically observed in lee within a genomic island of 49, 371 bp that encodes a total of 54 genes. a phylogenetic analysis was performed on the entire t3ss and four t3ss genes (escf, escj, escn,  and escv) to elucidate the genealogy of lee. phylogenetic analysis inferred that  the previously known lee islands are members of a single lineage distinct from the new salmonella lee lineage. the previously known lineage of lee diverged between islands found in citrobacter and those in escherichia and shigella. although recombination and horizontal gene transfer are important factors in the  genealogy of most genomic islands, the phylogeny of the t3ss of lee can be interpreted with a bifurcating tree. it seems likely that the lee island entered  the enterobacteriaceae through horizontal gene transfer as a single unit, rather  than as separate subsections, which was then subjected to the forces of both mutational change and recombination.

TI  == isolation and identification of escherichia albertii from a patient in an outbreak of gastroenteritis.
AB  == a microbial strain harboring the eae gene, which is known as the virulence gene of enteropathogenic escherichia coli (epec) and most enterohemorrhagic e. coli, was isolated from a patient in a gastroenteritis outbreak that occurred in 22 patients in akita prefecture, japan, in november 2011. the biochemical characteristics of the isolate were more similar to those of a novel escherichia  sp., e. albertii than e. coli. partial 16s rrna gene sequences of the isolate were identical to those of a certain e. albertii strain, but also showed a high degree of similarity to those of e. coli strains. finally, we identified this isolate as e. albertii by performing pcr analysis that targeted the uida, lysp, mdh, and cdtb genes in addition to stx and eae genes to differentiate between the epec and e. albertii strains.

TI  == clinical significance of escherichia albertii.
AB  == discriminating escherichia albertii from other enterobacteriaceae is difficult. systematic analyses showed that e. albertii represents a substantial portion of strains currently identified as eae-positive escherichia coli and includes shiga  toxin 2f-producing strains. because e. albertii possesses the eae gene, many strains might have been misidentified as enterohemorrhagic or enteropathogenic e. coli.

TI  == epidemiological investigation of eaea-positive escherichia coli and escherichia albertii strains isolated from healthy wild birds.
AB  == escherichia coli has commonly been associated with diarrheal illness in humans and animals. recently, e. albertii has been reported to be a potential pathogen of humans and animals and to be carried by wild birds. in the present study, the  prevalence and genetic characteristics of intimin-producing e. coli and e. albertii strains were evaluated in wild birds in korea. thirty one of 790 enterobacteriaceae strains from healthy wild birds were positive for the intimin  gene (eaea) and twenty two of the 31 strains were identified as atypical enteropathogenic e. coli (aepec) that did not possess both eaf and bfpa genes. a  total of nine lactose non-fermenting coliform bacterial strains were identified as e. albertii by pcr and sequence analysis of housekeeping genes. a total of 28  (90.3%) eaea-positive strains were isolated from waterfowl. fifteen aepec (68.2%) and two e. albertii (22.2%) strains had a beta-intimin subtype and 14 aepec strains harboring beta-intimin belonged to phylogenetic group b2. au eaea-positive e. albertii and 3 aepec strains possessed the cytolethal distending toxin gene (cdtb). the eaea-positive e. coli and e. albertii strains isolated from healthy wild birds need to be recognized as a potential pathogroup that may  pose a potential threat to human and animal health. these findings indicate that  eaea-positive e. coli as well as e. albertii can be carried by wild birds, posing a potential threat to human and animal health.

TI  == ability of three dna-based assays to identify presumptive escherichia coli colonies isolated from water by the culture-based mfc agar method.
AB  == we tested the ability of three pcr assays, targeting uida and tuf genes to correctly identify escherichia coli colonies isolated from water and we compared  them to two beta-glucuronidase-based culture methods (colilert((r)) and readycult((r))), in terms of specificity and sensitivity. e. coli isolates recovered on mfc agar were first tested for the presence of the uida positive colonies were presumed to be e. coli. for further characterization, uida-negative colonies were subsequently identified using the vitek 2 automated system. colilert((r)) and readycult((r)) detected 436 and 442 of 468 colonies identified  as e. coli on mfc corresponding to sensitivities of 93.2 and 94.4%, respectively. none of the 59 non-e. coli isolates was detected by both methods for a specificity of 100%. two (2) uida and 1 tuf pcr assays were also tested. the uida pcr assays yielded positive signals for 447 (95.5%) and 434 (92.7%) of 468 e. coli isolates tested respectively, whereas the tuf pcr assay showed a sensitivity of 100%. none of the 59 non-e. coli isolates was detected by both uida pcr assays (100% specificity), whereas tuf pcr false-positive signals were obtained with escherichia fergusonii and escherichia albertii. however, since these 2 species are principally found in the feces of mammals and birds, their detection indicates a fecal contamination. consequently, using a 1-h tuf rtpcr assay to confirm the identity of e. coli colonies on mfc agar is as specific, more sensitive, and potentially more cost-efficient than culture methods based on beta-glucuronidase detection.

TI  == biofilm formation by and thermal niche and virulence characteristics of escherichia spp.
AB  == in order to better understand the ecological and virulence characteristics of the various clades of escherichia, in vitro and in vivo experiments were undertaken.  members of the recently described cryptic clades of escherichia (clades iii, iv,  and v) were found to have an enhanced ability to form biofilms compared to strains of escherichia coli, e. fergusonii, or e. albertii. members of the cryptic clades were also able to replicate at a lower temperature (5 degrees c versus 11 degrees c) than strains of the named species of escherichia. neither a  strain's maximal growth rate nor its optimal temperature for growth varied with respect to the strain's phylogenetic affiliation. escherichia strains not belonging to the species e. coli were positive for a mix of traits thought to enhance a strain's ability to cause either intestinal or extraintestinal disease. however, no non-e. coli escherichia strain was virulent in a mouse model of extraintestinal infection. the frequency of resistance to antibiotics was low, and none of the strains tested harbored class 1, 2, or 3 integrons. the results of these experiments support the hypothesis that members of the cryptic escherichia clades may be better able to persist in the external environment compared to e. coli, e. fergusonii, or e. albertii, isolates.

TI  == phylogenetic incongruence arising from fragmented speciation in enteric bacteria.
AB  == evolutionary relationships among species are often assumed to be fundamentally unambiguous, where genes within a genome are thought to evolve in concert and phylogenetic incongruence between individual orthologs is attributed to idiosyncrasies in their evolution. we have identified substantial incongruence between the phylogenies of orthologous genes in escherichia, salmonella, and citrobacter, or e. coli, e. fergusonii, and e. albertii. the source of incongruence was inferred to be recombination, because individual genes support conflicting topology more robustly than expected from stochastic sequence homoplasies. clustering of phylogenetically informative sites on the genome indicated that the regions of recombination extended over several kilobases. analysis of phylogenetically distant taxa resulted in consensus among individual  gene phylogenies, suggesting that recombination is not ongoing; instead, conflicting relationships among genes in descendent taxa reflect recombination among their ancestors. incongruence could have resulted from random assortment of ancestral polymorphisms if species were instantly created from the division of a  recombining population. however, the estimated branch lengths in alternative phylogenies would require ancestral populations with far more diversity than is found in extant populations. rather, these and previous data collectively suggest that genome-wide recombination rates decreased gradually, with variation in rate  among loci, leading to pluralistic relationships among their descendent taxa.

TI  == escherichia albertii in wild and domestic birds.
AB  == escherichia albertii has been associated with diarrhea in humans but not with disease or infection in animals. however, in december 2004, e. albertii was found, by biochemical and genetic methods, to be the probable cause of death for  redpoll finches (carduelis flammea) in alaska. subsequent investigation found this organism in dead and subclinically infected birds of other species from north america and australia. isolates from dead finches in scotland, previously identified as escherichia coli o86:k61, also were shown to be e. albertii. similar to the isolates from humans, e. albertii isolates from birds possessed intimin (eae) and cytolethal distending toxin (cdtb) genes but lacked shiga toxin (stx) genes. genetic analysis of eae and cdtb sequences, multilocus sequence typing, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns showed that the e. albertii strains from birds are heterogeneous but similar to isolates that cause disease in humans.

TI  == fate of the h-ns-repressed bgl operon in evolution of escherichia coli.
AB  == in the enterobacterial species escherichia coli and salmonella enterica, expression of horizontally acquired genes with a higher than average at content is repressed by the nucleoid-associated protein h-ns. a classical example of an h-ns-repressed locus is the bgl (aryl-beta,d-glucoside) operon of e. coli. this locus is "cryptic," as no laboratory growth conditions are known to relieve repression of bgl by h-ns in e. coli k12. however, repression can be relieved by  spontaneous mutations. here, we investigated the phylogeny of the bgl operon. typing of bgl in a representative collection of e. coli demonstrated that it evolved clonally and that it is present in strains of the phylogenetic groups a,  b1, and b2, while it is presumably replaced by a cluster of orfans in the phylogenetic group d. interestingly, the bgl operon is mutated in 20% of the strains of phylogenetic groups a and b1, suggesting erosion of bgl in these groups. however, bgl is functional in almost all b2 isolates and, in approximately 50% of them, it is weakly expressed at laboratory growth conditions. homologs of bgl genes exist in klebsiella, enterobacter, and erwinia  species and also in low gc-content gram-positive bacteria, while absent in e. albertii and salmonella sp. this suggests horizontal transfer of bgl genes to an  ancestral enterobacterium. conservation and weak expression of bgl in isolates of phylogenetic group b2 may indicate a functional role of bgl in extraintestinal pathogenic e. coli.

TI  == characterization of a beta-glucoside operon (bgc) prevalent in septicemic and uropathogenic escherichia coli strains.
AB  == escherichia coli strains, in general, do not ferment cellobiose and aryl-beta-d-glucosidic sugars, although "cryptic" beta-d-glucoside systems have been characterized. here we describe an additional cryptic operon (bgc) for the utilization of cellobiose and the aryl-beta-d-glucosides arbutin and salicin at low temperature. the bgc operon was identified by the characterization of beta-glucoside-positive mutants of an e. coli septicemia strain (i484) in which the well-studied bgl (aryl-beta-d-glucoside) operon was deleted. these bgc* mutants appeared after 5 days of incubation on salicin indicator plates at 28 degrees c. the bgc operon codes for proteins homologous to beta-glucoside/cellobiose-specific phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransfer  system permease subunits iib (bgce), iic (bgcf), and iia (bgci); a porin (bgch);  and a phospho-beta-d-glucosidase (bgca). next to the bgc operon maps the divergent bgcr gene, which encodes a gntr-type transcriptional regulator. expression of the bgc operon is dependent on the cyclic-amp-dependent regulator protein crp and positively controlled by bgcr. in the bgc* mutants, a single nucleotide exchange enhances the activity of the bgc promoter, rendering it bgcr  independent. typing of a representative collection of e. coli demonstrated the prevalence of bgc in strains of phylogenetic group b2, representing mainly extraintestinal pathogens, while it is rare among commensal e. coli strains. the  bgc locus is also present in the closely related species escherichia albertii. further, bioinformatic analyses demonstrated that homologs of the bgc genes exist in the enterobacterial klebsiella, enterobacter, and citrobacter spp. and also in gram-positive bacteria, indicative of horizontal gene transfer events.

TI  == escherichia albertii and hafnia alvei are candidate enteric pathogens with divergent effects on intercellular tight junctions.
AB  == attaching-effacing lesion-inducing escherichia albertii and the related, but non-attaching-effacing organism, hafnia alvei, are both implicated as enteric pathogens in humans. however, effects of these bacteria on epithelial cells are not well-characterized. related enteropathogens, including enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli o157:h7, decrease epithelial barrier function by disrupting intercellular tight junctions in polarized epithelia. therefore, this study assessed epithelial barrier function and tight junction protein distribution in polarized epithelia following bacterial infections. polarized epithelial (mdck-i  and t84) cells grown on filter supports were infected apically with e. coli o157:h7, e. albertii, and h. alvei for 16h at 37 degrees c. all strains decreased transepithelial electrical resistance and increased permeability to a dextran probe in a host cell-dependent manner. immunofluorescence microscopy showed that  both e. coli o157:h7 and e. albertii, but not h. alvei, caused a redistribution of the tight junction protein zona occludens-1. in contrast to e. coli o157:h7, e. albertii and h. alvei did not redistribute claudin-1. western blotting of whole cell protein extracts demonstrated that each bacterium caused differential  changes in tight junction protein expression, dependent on the host cell. these findings demonstrate that e. albertii and h. alvei are candidate enteric pathogens that have both strain-specific and host epithelial cell-dependent effects.

TI  == role of rna polymerase sigma-factor (rpos) in induction of glutamate-dependent acid-resistance of escherichia albertii under anaerobic conditions.
AB  == escherichia albertii is a potential enteric food-borne pathogen with poorly defined genetic and biochemical properties. acid resistance is perceived to be an important property of enteric pathogens, enabling them to survive passage through stomach acidity so that they may colonize the mammalian gastrointestinal tract. we analyzed glutamate-dependent acid-resistance pathway (gdar) in five e. albertii strains that have been identified so far. we observed that the strains were unable to induce gdar under aerobic growth conditions. mobilization of the rpos gene restored aerobic induction of this acid-resistance pathway, indicating  that all five strains may have a dysfunctional sigma-factor. on the other hand, under anaerobic growth conditions where gdar is induced in an rpos-independent manner (i.e. in shigella spp. and escherichia coli o157:h7 strains), only three out of five e. albertii strains successfully induced gdar. the remainder of the two strains exhibited dependence on functional rpos even under anaerobic conditions to express gdar, a regulatory function previously considered to be redundant. the data indicate that certain e. albertii strains may have an alternate rpos-dependent pathway for acid-resistance under anaerobic growth conditions.

TI  == allelic subtyping of the intimin locus (eae) of pathogenic escherichia coli by fluorescent rflp.
AB  == intimin is a highly polymorphic protein encoded by the eae gene and plays a crucial role in the attaching-effacing phenotype of diarrheagenic escherichia coli and related pathogens. we have developed a method to quickly and accurately  uncover allelic variation at the eae locus through the use of fluorescent rflp (frflp). application of frflp to 151 eae-positive strains (including the newly described escherichia albertii) revealed 26 different frflp types that correspond to 20 of the 28 previously described eae alleles. two sequence variants of the gamma, iota, kappa, and zeta alleles and three variants of epsilon were also observed. in addition to being reliable and accurate, the method can be easily adapted to accommodate new eae allelic sequences, as they become known.

TI  == evolutionary genetics of a new pathogenic escherichia species: escherichia albertii and related shigella boydii strains.
AB  == a bacterium originally described as hafnia alvei induces diarrhea in rabbits and  causes epithelial damage similar to the attachment and effacement associated with enteropathogenic escherichia coli. subsequent studies identified similar h. alvei-like strains that are positive for an intimin gene (eae) probe and, based on dna relatedness, are classified as a distinct escherichia species, escherichia albertii. we determined sequences for multiple housekeeping genes in five e. albertii strains and compared these sequences to those of strains representing the major groups of pathogenic e. coli and shigella. a comparison of 2,484 codon  positions in 14 genes revealed that e. albertii strains differ, on average, at approximately 7.4% of the nucleotide sites from pathogenic e. coli strains and at 15.7% from salmonella enterica serotype typhimurium. interestingly, e. albertii strains were found to be closely related to strains of shigella boydii serotype 13 (shigella b13), a distant relative of e. coli representing a divergent lineage in the genus escherichia. analysis of homologues of intimin (eae) revealed that the central conserved domains are similar in e. albertii and shigella b13 and distinct from those of eae variants found in pathogenic e. coli. sequence analysis of the cytolethal distending toxin gene cluster (cdt) also disclosed three allelic groups corresponding to e. albertii, shigella b13, and a nontypeable isolate serologically related to s. boydii serotype 7. based on the synonymous substitution rate, the e. albertii-shigella b13 lineage is estimated to have split from an e. coli-like ancestor approximately 28 million years ago and formed a distinct evolutionary branch of enteric pathogens that has radiated  into groups with distinct virulence properties.

AB  == the taxonomic position of a group of five d-sorbitol- and lactose-negative enterobacterial isolates recovered from diarrhoeal stools of children at the international centre for diarrhoeal disease research, bangladesh (icddr,b), was investigated by dna-dna hybridization, phenotypic characterization and 16s rdna sequencing. these strains were originally identified as 'hafnia alvei-like' with  the api 20e system but, in fact, show more phenotypic and genotypic resemblance to members of the genus escherichia. by 16s rdna sequencing, one representative strain of the icddr,b group was shown to be closely affiliated to the genera escherichia and shigella. using the fluorimetric microplate hybridization method, the diarrhoeagenic icddr,b isolates were found to constitute a homogeneous taxon  (> or = 82% internal dna relatedness), with the closest affiliation to the type strains of escherichia coli (55-64%) and shigella flexneri (54-60%). the dna-dna  hybridization levels were much lower with members of other described escherichia  species (16-45%) and with the type strain of h. alvei (9-17%). the g + c content  of the icddr,b strains ranged from 50.5 to 50.7 mol%. together with the diagnostic characteristics reported previously, including the presence of the eaea gene of enteropathogenic e. coli and of the e. coli and shigella-specific phoe gene, it is concluded that the icddr,b strains represent a novel taxon in the genus escherichia, for which the name escherichia albertii sp. nov. is proposed. its type strain is albert 19982(t) (= lmg 20976(t) = ccug 46494(t)).
