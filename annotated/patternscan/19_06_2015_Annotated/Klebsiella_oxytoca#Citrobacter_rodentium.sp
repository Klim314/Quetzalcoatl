TI  == novel class a beta-lactamase sed-1 from citrobacter sedlakii: genetic diversity of beta-lactamases within the citrobacter genus.
AB  == citrobacter sedlakii 2596, a clinical strain resistant to aminopenicillins, carboxypenicillins, and early cephalosporins such as cephalothin, but remaining susceptible to acylureidopenicillins, carbapenems, and later cephalosporins such  as cefotaxime, was isolated from the bile of a patient treated with beta-lactam and quinolone antibiotics. the isolate produced an inducible class a beta-lactamase of pi 8.6, named sed-1, which was purified. characterized by a molecular mass of 30 kda, sed-1 preferentially hydrolyzed benzylpenicillin, cephalothin, and cloxacillin. the corresponding gene, bla(sed-1), was cloned and  sequenced. its deduced amino acid sequence shared more than 60% identity with the chromosome-encoded beta-lactamases from citrobacter koseri (formerly c. diversus) (84%), klebsiella oxytoca (74%), serratia fonticola (67%), and proteus vulgaris (63%) and 71% identity with the plasmid-mediated enzyme men-1. a gene coding for  a lysr transcriptional regulator was found upstream from bla(sed-1). this regulator, named sedr, displayed 90% identity with the ampr sequence of the chromosomal beta-lactamase from c. koseri and 63 and 50% identity with the ampr sequences of p. vulgaris and enterobacter cloacae, respectively. by using dna-dna hybridization, a bla(sed-1)-like gene was identified in two reference strains, c. sedlakii (cip-105037) and citrobacter rodentium (cip-104675), but not in the 18 strains of c. koseri studied. two dna fragments were amplified and sequenced from the reference strains of c. sedlakii cip-105037 and c. rodentium cip-104675 using two primers specific for bla(sed-1). they shared 98 and 80% identity with bla(sed-1), respectively, confirming the diversity of the chromosomally encoded class a beta-lactamases found in citrobacter.
