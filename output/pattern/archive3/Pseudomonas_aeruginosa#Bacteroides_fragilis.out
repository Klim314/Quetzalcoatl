in vitro activities of doripenem and six comparator drugs against 423 aerobic and anaerobic bacterial isolates from infected diabetic foot wounds.
against 182 anaerobe and 241 aerobe strains obtained from diabetic foot infections, doripenem was the most active carbapenem against pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic(90), 2 microg/ml), more active than imipenem against proteus mirabilis, and ertapenem was more active against escherichia coli and klebsiella spp. the mic(50) and mic(90) values were < or =0.125 microg/ml for methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus and all streptococci and 0.25/1 for bacteroides fragilis.
inhibitory effects of various micro-organisms on the growth of helicobacter pylori.
aims: to examine the in vitro influence of various bacteria species on helicobacter pylori (hp) growth. methods and results: the effects of 29 micro-organisms on 31 hp strains were determined using two modified 'cross streak' methods. staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, morganella morganii, serratia marcescens, bacteroides fragilis, fusobacterium nucleatum and clostridium difficile showed the strongest inhibition. the inhibitory effects varied, depending on the bacteria spp. and hp strains, and were method dependent. the caga status of hp strains did not correlate with the extent of inhibition. conclusions: helicobacter pylori is inhibited by a significant number of commensal bacteria species as well as opportunistic human pathogens. the success and progress of hp infection may be influenced by the bacterial flora present, while the difficulty in cultivating hp from the oral mucosa and faeces may be the result of antagonistic bacterial interaction. significance and impact of the study: this study provides valuable data on the sensitivity of hp to a variety of intestinal and oral commensals as well as opportunistic human pathogens. hp's varying pathogenicity and the specific localization of infection may be the result of these sensitivities. these results can also serve as a basis for further studies to identify the inhibitory substances and make them available for therapeutic use.
in vitro activity of ertapenem against anaerobes isolated from the respiratory tract.
ertapenem is a novel parenteral carbapenem with a long serum half-life. its spectrum of activity is similar to that of imipenem and meropenem against gram-positive bacteria, enterobacteriaceae and fastidious gram-negative bacteria but it is less active against pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. several studies were performed in the united states but only one european study has shown that ertapenem has an excellent activity against anaerobes. the objectives of the present study were to test the activity of ertapenem against anaerobes isolated prospectively from the lower and upper respiratory tracts, and to compare their susceptibility with that of anaerobic isolates from other body sites. fifty-three isolates from the respiratory tract, as well as 50 isolates from various other body sites were tested with e-tests against six antibiotics. for respiratory isolates and for isolates from other sites, mic 90 values (mg/l) were, respectively, >32 and >32 for penicillin, 0.38 and 0.75 for amoxicillin/clavulanate, 48 and >256 for ceftriaxone, 0.12 and 0.75 for ertapenem, 12 and >256 for clindamycin and 2 and 12 for moxifloxacin. the higher susceptibility of respiratory tract isolates was mainly due to the different distribution of isolated species: only three respiratory isolates but 22 other isolates belonged to the bacteroides fragilis group. this study confirms the excellent anti-anaerobic activity of ertapenem against anaerobic isolates from the respiratory tract.
cefditoren, a new aminothiazolyl cephalosporin.
cefditoren pivoxil, an oral third-generation cephalosporin, was approved by the food and drug administration in september 2001. it has been used in japan for several years. the greatest therapeutic potential of cefditoren appears to be its activity against gram-positive and gram-negative organisms causing respiratory tract infections and skin and skin-structure infections, such as haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, and moraxella catarrhalis. cefditoren is also effective against methicillin-susceptible strains of staphylococcus aureus. nevertheless, cefditoren has no activity against atypical pathogens, including chlamydia pneumoniae, mycoplasma pneumoniae, and legionella sp. moreover, cefditoren does not inhibit pseudomonas aeruginosa or bacteroides fragilis. in virtually all studies, cefditoren has compared favorably against other orally administered antibiotics used against the most commonly isolated respiratory tract pathogens. its side effect profile includes diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, headache, and dyspepsia. cefditoren is indicated for treatment of mild-to-moderate acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, pharyngitis-tonsillitis, and uncomplicated skin and skin-structure infections caused by susceptible strains of organisms in adults and adolescents (> or = 12 yrs of age). based on its reported antimicrobial activity, cefditoren has potential for empiric management of most commonly encountered respiratory tract infections. additional studies will further define its role in clinical practice.
identification of a series of tricyclic natural products as potent broad-spectrum inhibitors of metallo-beta-lactamases.
this work describes the discovery and characterization of a novel series of tricyclic natural product-derived metallo-beta-lactamase inhibitors. natural product screening of the bacillus cereus ii enzyme identified an extract from a strain of chaetomium funicola with inhibitory activity against metallo-beta-lactamases. sb236050, sb238569, and sb236049 were successfully extracted and purified from this extract. the most active of these compounds was sb238569, which possessed k(i) values of 79, 17, and 3.4 microm for the bacillus cereus ii, pseudomonas aeruginosa imp-1, and bacteroides fragilis cfia metallo-beta-lactamases, respectively, yet none of the compounds exhibited any inhibitory activity against the stenotrophomonas maltophilia l-1 metallo-beta-lactamase (50% inhibitory concentration > 1,000 microm). the lack of activity against angiotensin-converting enzyme and serine beta-lactamases demonstrated the selective nature of these compounds. the crystal structure of sb236050 complexed in the active site of cfia has been obtained to a resolution of 2.5 a. sb236050 exhibits key polar interactions with lys184, asn193, and his162 and a stacking interaction with the indole ring of trp49 in the flap, which is in the closed conformation over the active site groove. sb236050 and sb238569 also demonstrate good antibacterial synergy with meropenem. eight micrograms of sb236050 per ml gave rise to an eightfold drop in the mic of meropenem for two clinical isolates of b. fragilis producing cfia, making these strains sensitive to meropenem (mic < or = 4 microg/ml). consequently, this series of metallo-beta-lactamase inhibitors exhibit the most promising antibacterial synergy activity so far observed against organisms producing metallo-beta-lactamases.
the in-vitro activity and tentative breakpoint of gemifloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone.
the in-vitro activity of gemifloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, against a wide range (c. 700) of recent clinical isolates, was compared with that of three other fluoroquinolones and other relevant agents. gemifloxacin inhibited 90% of the enterobacteriaceae strains at 0.5 mg/l or less, exceptions being serratia spp. (mic(90) 1 mg/l) and strains possessing a putative mechanism of resistance to fluoroquinolones. ninety per cent of pseudomonas aeruginosa were inhibited by 4 mg/l. gemifloxacin had good activity against respiratory pathogens, with 90% of streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis being inhibited by 0.06 mg/l or less. staphylococcus aureus (mssa) were highly susceptible (mic(90) 0.06 mg/l) but mrsa less susceptible (mic(90) 8 mg/l) to gemifloxacin. enterococcus spp. were markedly more susceptible to the study agent than to ciprofloxacin. gemifloxacin showed good activity against bacteroides fragilis (mic(90) 0.5 mg/l) and anaerobic cocci. a tentative in-vitro breakpoint of 0.5 mg/l was studied using a 1 microg disc content for all genera except pseudomonas where a 5 microg disc content was employed. the false sensitivity reporting rate was 0.5% and false resistance rate was 6.0%, which was considered acceptable. in conclusion, gemifloxacin is a highly active fluoroquinolone that should prove clinically useful in the treatment of a wide range of infections. susceptibility testing criteria have been developed that should prove robust in a clinical laboratory.
men 10700, a new penem antibiotic: in-vitro activity and its correlation with beta-lactamase stability, pbp affinity and diffusion through the bacterial cell wall.
the in-vitro activity of men 10700, a novel penem, was compared with that of imipenem, ritipenem, ampicillin/sulbactam, cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin and amikacin against 1088 strains taken from 21 genera, including gram-negative, gram-positive and anaerobic bacteria. mic data showed that men 10700 was very active against staphylococci and streptococci (mic90 < or = 0.5 mg/l) and against most members of the enterobacteriaceae (mic90 < or = 2 mg/l), with reduced activity only against providencia stuartii (mic90 = 8 mg/l). men 10700 was also active against anaerobic species such as clostridium perfringens and bacteroides fragilis as well as moraxella catarrhalis. it was moderately active against enterococcus faecalis and inactive against pseudomonas aeruginosa, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, aeromonas spp. and acinetobacter spp. its antibacterial spectrum was thus slightly narrower than that of imipenem, but compared favourably with those of a third-generation cephalosporin and ritipenem. men 10700 was highly stable to a number of beta-lactamases and was a poor inducer of class i enzymes. it bound penicillin-binding protein 2 with the highest affinity and easily permeated the outer membrane of escherichia coli.
the activity of the methylpiperazinyl fluoroquinolone cg 5501: a comparison with  other fluoroquinolones.
the in-vitro activity of cg 5501 against a wide range of recent clinical isolates was compared with that of three fluoroquinolones. cg 5501 inhibited 90% of the species of the family enterobacteriaceae at 0.5 mg/l or less, exceptions being enterobacter spp. (mic90 2 mg/l) and serratia spp. (mic90 4 mg/l). ninety per cent of pseudomonas aeruginosa, stenotrophomonas maltophilia and acinetobacter spp. were inhibited by 16, 4 and 1 mg/l respectively. cg 5501 had high activity against gram-positive cocci, 90% of staphylococci being inhibited at 2 mg/l. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus strains were generally ciprofloxacin-resistant yet were all susceptible to 4 mg/l or less of cg 5501. isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae were eight-fold more susceptible to cg 5501 (mic90 0.5 mg/l) than to ciprofloxacin (mic90 4 mg/l) and the former had a similar activity to that of trovafloxacin and sparfloxacin. enterococcus faecalis was generally two- to four-fold more susceptible to cg 5501 or trovafloxacin than to ciprofloxacin. cg 5501 and trovafloxacin had high activity against bacteroides fragilis (mic90 0.25 mg/l). five strains of chlamydia spp. were inhibited by < or =0.12 mg/l of cg 5501; sensitive and multiresistant strains of mycobacterium tuberculosis were inhibited by < or =0.5 mg/l of cg 5501. the high activity and breadth of its antibacterial spectrum suggests that cg 5501 should be useful in a wide range of clinical infections.
in vitro activity of the tricyclic beta-lactam gv104326.
gv104326 is a novel tricyclic beta-lactam (a trinem or, formerly, tribactam). the in vitro activity of gv104326 was compared with those of cefuroxime, cefixime, amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cefpirome, and ciprofloxacin. gv104326 had in vitro activity generally similar to that of cefixime against members of the family enterobacteriaceae (mic at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited [mic90], < or = 2 micrograms/ml), with cefuroxime and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid being 8- to 32-fold less active and with cefpirome being 4- to 8-fold more active against members of this family. the trinem had no activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa or stenotrophomonas maltophilia (mic90, > 128 micrograms/ml) but was the most active agent against acinetobacter calcoaceticus. gv104326 was particularly active against gram-positive cocci. ninety percent of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus strains were susceptible to 0.03 microgram of gv104326 per ml, making it the most active agent studied. enterococci and lancefield group a and b streptococci were generally equally or somewhat more susceptible to gv104326 than they were to amoxicillin. streptococcus pneumoniae strains were highly susceptible to gv104326, and those strains which showed decreased susceptibility to penicillin were generally twofold more susceptible to the trinem than to amoxicillin. haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis were highly susceptible to gv104326 (mic90s, 0.12 and 0.03 microgram/ml, respectively). the anaerobes clostridium perfringens, bacteroides fragilis, and peptostreptococcus spp. were more susceptible to the trinems (formerly tribactams) than to the other agents studied.
anti-bacteroides lipopolysaccharide igg levels in healthy adults and sepsis patients.
members of the genus bacteroides greatly outnumber enterobacteria in the human colon and therefore represent a vast potential pool of biologically active lps. an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was developed to estimate the distribution of igg levels to lps from b. fragilis, b. vulgatus, b. thetaiotaomicron and to a mixture of rough lps from three enterobacteria and pseudomonas aeruginosa in sera from 641 adult blood donors. by inhibition elisa some cross-reactivity was demonstrated between the different anti-bacteroides lps igg, but with very little between the anti-bacteroides lps igg and the anti-enterobacterial/pseudomonas lps igg. serum igg was measured daily over 5-9 day periods in 12 sepsis patients (6 survivors, 6 non-survivors) and in a healthy individual. in all patients igg levels fluctuated to a greater extent than levels in a healthy subject. variations all followed similar overall trends and indicated that exposure to bacteroides lps had occurred. in 5 out of 6 survivors, igg levels were rising at the end of the period, while 4 of the 6 non-survivors showed falls, with an exception showing increasing levels to b. fragilis lps. in 5 out of 6 non-survivors, igg levels against b. fragilis lps were substantially higher than those against the other lpss. in this small sample some trends in antibody kinetics have been recognised which suggest bacteroides lps may be significant in sepsis, and indicate that this study should be extended.
e-4695, a new c-7 azetidinyl fluoronaphthyridine with enhanced activity against gram-positive and anaerobic pathogens.
e-4695, (-)-7-[3-(r)-amino-2-(s)-methyl-1-azetidinyl]-1-cyclopropyl-1,4- dihydro-6-fluoro-4-oxo-1,8-naphthyridine-3-carboxylic acid, is a new fluorinated naphthyridine with an azetidine moiety. the mics of e-4695 at which 90% of the isolates were inhibited (mic90s) were 0.06 to 0.5 microgram/ml for gram-positive cocci, including species of the genera staphylococcus, streptococcus, and enterococcus, and the mic90s against gram-negative pathogens such as members of the family enterobacteriaceae (with the exception of providencia spp. [mic90, 8 micrograms/ml]) and pseudomonas aeruginosa were 0.015 to 0.5 microgram/ml. e-4695 inhibited 90% of the clostridium perfringens and bacteroides fragilis isolates at 0.25 and 4 micrograms/ml, respectively. against gram-positive cocci the potency of e-4695 was 2- to 8-fold higher than that of ciprofloxacin, 4- to 8-fold higher than that of ofloxacin, and 8- to 16-fold higher than that of fleroxacin. against enteric bacteria and p. aeruginosa the potency of e-4695 was, in general, similar to that of ciprofloxacin and eightfold higher than those of ofloxacin and fleroxacin. e-4695 was four- and eightfold more potent than ciprofloxacin against c. perfringens and b. fragilis isolates, respectively. e-4695 and ciprofloxacin showed similar properties when the effects of ph or magnesium concentration were tested on them. e-4695 and ciprofloxacin had substantial reductions of activity only when ph decreased below 4.8. e-4695 and ciprofloxacin activities were not markedly affected by the presence of 5 or 10 mm mg2+. the presence of serum and human urine at ph 7.2 decreased the activity of e-4695 between two- and fourfold. after an oral dose of 50 mg/kg of body weight, the maximum level in serum, the biological half-life, and the area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 10 h for e-4695 were 13.2 microgram/ml, 3.3 h, and 45.6 microgram . h/ml, respectively. the area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 4 h for ciprofloxacin was 2.3 microgram . h/ml at the same dose. fifty-percent effective doses (ed50s) against staphylococcus aureus hs-93 infections in mice were 4.5 mg/kg with e-4695 and 37.6 mg/kg with ciprofloxacin. infection with streptococcus pneumoniae 29206 was more effectively treated with e-4695 (ed50, 41,2 mg/kg) than with ciprofloxacin (ed50, 200 mg/kg). the ed50 of e-4695 for infections with streptococcus pneumoniae 1625 was 132.2 mg/kg; ciprofloxacin was ineffective at 400 mg/kg against this strain. e-4695 was also more potent than ciprofloxacin in treatment of infections caused by gram-negative organisms such as escherichia coli hm-42 (ed50s, 1.0 and 3.9 mg/kg, respectively). the ed50s of e-4695 and ciprofloxacin were 33.0 and 145.5 mg/kg against p. aeruginosa hs-116 and 9.6 and 18.9 mg/kg against p. aeruginosa b-120, respectively. the therapeutic efficacy of e-4695 may depend not only on its in vitro activity but also on its improved pharmacokinetic properties.
in-vitro activity of four new fluoroquinolones.
the in-vitro activities of four new fluoroquinolones, e-4749, e-4874, e-4884 and  e-4904, were compared with that of ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against 1106 clinical isolates. against majority of enterobacteriaceae, general antibacterial activities of e-4749 (mic90s 0.06-1 mg/l), e-4874 (mic90s, 0.03-0.25 mg/l) and e-4884 (mic90s 0.01-0.5 mg/l) were comparable or slightly lower than those of ciproloxacin (mic90s 0.01-0.25 mg/l) and sparfloxacin (mic90s 0.01-1 mg/l). the activity of e-4904 (mic90s 0.06-2 mg/l) was lower than those of its analogues. most of the escherichia coli which were resistant to ciprofloxacin (mic > or = 2 mg/l) and serratia spp., were resistant to the new fluoroquinolones. beta-lactamase producing strains of moraxella catarrhalis were very susceptible to these compounds (mics < or = 0.008 mg/l). most of pseudomonas aeruginosa, non-aeruginosa pseudomonas spp., xanthomonas maltophilia, and acinetobacter spp. were resistant to the new quinolones (mic90s 8- > 16 mg/l). on the contrary, these new antimicrobials were active against the majority of the aeromonas spp. (mic90s < or = 0.5 mg/l). e-4749, e-4874, e-4884 and e-4904 remained active (mic90s < or = 0.25 mg/l) against staphylococcus aureus strains susceptible to methicillin. however, its activity was two- to eight-fold lower than that of ciprofloxacin (mic90 0.03 mg/l) and sparfloxacin (mic90 0.06 mg/l). against s. aureus resistant to methicillin or ciprofloxacin, activity of these new compounds and comparators agents, was very low (mic90s 2- > 16 mg/l). most of the strains of enterococcus faecalis were resistant (mic90s > 16 mg/l). the activity of e-4874, e-4904 and sparfloxacin (mic90 1 mg/l for each one) was higher than that of the rest of the agents tested. e-4874 (mic90 0.25 mg/l) was four-fold more active than the other antibacterials tested (mic90 2 mg/l) against listeria monocytogenes. no new quinolone was active against bacteroides fragilis (mic90s 4-16 mg/l), bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (mic90s 8- > 16 mg/l), and other b. fragilis group (mic90s 16- > 16 mg/l). ciprofloxacin (mic90s > 16 mg/l), and sparfloxacin (mic90s 8-16 mg/l) also were inactive. e-4874 (mic90 4 mg/l) was the most active quinolone tested against b.fragilis.
in vitro and in vivo evaluations of a-80556, a new fluoroquinolone.
a-80556 is a novel fluoroquinolone with potent antibacterial activity against gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic organisms. a-80556 was more active than ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, lomefloxacin, and sparfloxacin against gram-positive bacteria. a-80556 was particularly active against staphylococcus aureus (mic for 90% of isolates [mic90], 0.12 microgram/ml, relative to fluoroquinolone-susceptible strains) and streptococcus pneumoniae (mic90, 0.12 microgram/ml). a-80556 was also the most active of the quinolones tested against ciprofloxacin-resistant s. aureus, with an mic90 of 4.0 micrograms/ml; that of ciprofloxacin was > 128 micrograms/ml. however, the significance of this activity is not known. a-80556 was slightly less active against escherichia coli (mic90, 0.06 microgram/ml) and other enteric organisms than ciprofloxacin (mic90 for e. coli, < or = 0.03 microgram/ml). a-80556 was slightly less active against pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic90, 4.0 micrograms/ml) than ciprofloxacin (mic90, 2.0 micrograms/ml) and more active against acinetobacter spp. (respective mic90s, 0.12 and 0.5 microgram/ml). a-80556 was also the most active compound against anaerobes. against bacteroides fragilis, the mic90 of a-80556 was 2.0 micrograms/ml; that of ciprofloxacin was 16 micrograms/ml. the in vivo efficacy of a-80556 in experimental models with both gram-positive and gram-negative infections was consistent with the in vitro activity and pharmacokinetics and oral absorption in mice.
[antimicrobial activities of polymyxin b against clinically isolated microbial strains. results of mic determination including high concentrations].
minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined for polymyxin b (pl-b),  gentamicin, ofloxacin and norfloxacin against clinically isolated microbial strains collected since november 1992, and the following conclusions were obtained: 1. judging from the mic distribution of pl-b against the studied strains including multi-drug resistant organisms of major strains of family enterobacteriaceae, such as escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter spp., and pseudomonas aeruginosa, it appeared that no pl-b resistant strains were detected among those gram-negative organisms within the antimicrobial spectrum of pl-b. 2. mics of pl-b against most strains including methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci were distributed between 100 and 800 micrograms/ml. these results supported reports of other investigators that the eradication of staphylococcus spp. including mrsa (methicillin-resistant s. aureus) was possible by the use of pl-b at 1 mg/ml. 3. mic distribution of pl-b against organisms of the bacteroides fragilis group was almost the same as the results described above.
in vitro activities of bay y3118, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and fleroxacin against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens from respiratory tract and soft tissue infections.
bay y3118 was highly active against moraxella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, legionella pneumophila, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus (except quinolone-resistant, methicillin-resistant s. aureus), staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus pneumoniae (mic for 90% of strains tested [mic90], 0.063 micrograms/ml). for enterococcus faecalis and corynebacterium jeikeium, mic90s were 4 and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. bay y3118 was as active as ciprofloxacin against pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) and had potent activity against bacteroides fragilis (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml).
antimicrobial activity of the new carbapenem biapenem compared to imipenem, meropenem and other broad-spectrum beta-lactam drugs.
the in vitro activity of biapenem was compared to that of imipenem, meropenem and other broad-spectrum beta-lactams. a total of 716 isolates from recent cases of clinical septicemia and an additional 137 stock strains possessing known beta-lactamases or other well-characterized resistance mechanisms were tested. the minimal concentrations inhibiting 90% of strains (mic90) of enterobacteriaceae species were for biapenem 0.03 to 1 mg/l and for imipenem 0.25 to 2 mg/l. no member of the enterobacteriaceae was found to be resistant to biapenem. biapenem and meropenem were the most active drugs against pseudomonas aeruginosa, with an mic90 of 1 mg/l. biapenem was more active than ceftazidime against most gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria tested. biapenem was as potent as imipenem against anaerobic bacteria (including bacteroides fragilis), with an mic90 of 0.25 mg/l. high mics of biapenem were demonstrated for xanthomonas maltophilia, oxacillin-resistant staphylococcus spp. and enterococcus spp. these species have demonstrated resistance to other carbapenems and to most of the newer cephalosporins. the results of this study, coupled with previously documented favorable qualities of biapenem, endorse further investigation of this broad-spectrum antibacterial agent for clinical use.
comparative in vitro activity of biapenem, a new carbapenem antibiotic.
biapenem is a new carbapenem antibiotic with high stability to human renal dehydropeptidase i. its in vitro activity was compared with that of imipenem, meropenem, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, piperacillin and gentamicin against a total of 650 recent clinical isolates. mics were determined by a standard agar dilution procedure and all isolates were tested at two inocula (10(4) and 10(6) cfu). biapenem inhibited 90% of isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia stuartii, enterobacter spp., citrobacter freundii, serratia marcescens, salmonella typhi, shigella sonnei and yersinia enterocolitica at < or = 2 mg/l and was as active as or two- to four-fold more active than imipenem against all these species, with the exception of serratia marcescens, against which imipenem was two-fold more active. biapenem was two-fold more active than imipenem against pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic90 4 mg/l) and had activity similar to that of imipenem against the bacteroides fragilis group (mic90 0.5 mg/l) but was two-fold less active than imipenem against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mic90 0.06 mg/l) and was, like imipenem, inactive against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
in vitro antibacterial activity of fk037, a novel parenteral broad-spectrum cephalosporin.
fk037 is a new parenteral cephalosporin, which offers some advantages over the commercially available parenteral cephalosporins. it demonstrated potent broad-spectrum activity against clinical isolates of gram-positive bacteria including methicillin-resistant staphylococci, and gram-negative bacteria including pseudomonas aeruginosa. against clinical isolates of aerobic gram-positive bacteria, fk037, like cefpirome, demonstrated more potent activity than ceftazidime, cefoperazone and ceftizoxime. it is noteworthy that fk037, on the basis of the mic90s, was the most active of all the cephalosporins tested against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa). it was similar in activity to cefpirome against methicillin-sensitive s. aureus (mssa). against clinical isolates of aerobic gram-negative bacteria, fk037, like cefpirome, was superior to cefoperazone, similar to ceftazidime and inferior to ceftizoxime in activity. against p. aeruginosa, fk037 was superior to cefoperazone, similar or slightly superior to cefpirome and inferior to ceftazidime in activity. however, fk037 exhibited significant activity against citrobacter and enterobacter which were highly resistant to ceftazidime, cefoperazone and ceftizoxime. fk037 had an advantage in that its bactericidal activity against s. aureus, escherichia coli and p. aeruginosa at sub-mics (1/2 or 1/4 the mic) was much stronger than those of cefpirome and ceftazidime. moreover, it exhibited potent bactericidal activity against mssa, mrsa and p. aeruginosa in a pharmacokinetic in vitro model simulating human plasma concentrations after intravenous dosage of 0.125, 1.0 and 1.0 g, respectively. fk037 inhibited essential penicillin-binding proteins (pbps), 1, 2 and 3 of s. aureus with a 50% inhibitory concentration (i50) of 0.58 micrograms/ml or lower. of essential pbps 3, 1a and 1b of e. coli and p. aeruginosa, fk037 inhibited pbp 3 at the lowest i50 (0.03 and 0.04 micrograms/ml, respectively) and pbps 1a and 1b with i50 values of 2.7 micrograms/ml or lower. fk037, like cefpirome, was highly stable to hydrolysis by various beta-lactamases except ic cephalosporinase from bacteroides fragilis, and had extremely low affinity for beta-lactamases. therefore, fk037 was more potent than ceftazidime in activity against beta-lactamase-producing bacteria except p. aeruginosa and serratia marcescens. the ability of fk037 to penetrate the outer membrane of e. coli was slightly higher than that of ceftazidime, but slightly lower than that of cefpirome.
in vitro activity of l-627, a new carbapenem.
the in vitro activity of l-627, a new parenterally administered carbapenem, was compared with those of imipenem, meropenem, fce 22101 (a penem), ceftazidime, and ceftriaxone. l-627 was active against members of the family enterobacteriaceae (mic for 90% of strains tested [mic90] ranging from 0.03 to 4 micrograms/ml). l-627 displayed activity equal to that of meropenem against pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic90, 2 micrograms/ml), although, as with other carbapenems, the antipseudomonal activity was reduced against d2-deficient strains. staphylococci and streptococci were susceptible (mic90 of 1.0 micrograms/ml for staphylococcus aureus and 0.015 micrograms/ml for group a streptococci). l-627 also had activity against anaerobic bacteria (mic90, 2.0 micrograms/ml for bacteroides fragilis). neisseria gonorrhoeae and neisseria meningitidis were highly susceptible (mic90, 0.06 micrograms/ml), and against the common respiratory pathogens (haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, and moraxella catarrhalis), the mic90s were less than or equal to 2.0 micrograms/ml. the protein binding of l-627 ranged from 13.8 to 22%, depending on the concentration. the presence of human serum had little effect on the mic or mbc of l-627. these results suggest that l-627 merits further study in the treatment of infections caused by a wide range of pathogens.
in vitro antimicrobial activity of the new antibiotic vermisporin.
the antimicrobial activity of vermisporin, a new antibiotic produced by fermentation of the fungus ophiobolus vermisporis, was tested in vitro. vermisporin inhibited 90% of bacteroides fragilis and other bacteroides spp. at 1 microgram/ml (range 0.25-1 micrograms/ml). clostridium perfringens were inhibited by 1 microgram/ml (range 0.25-2 micrograms/ml). vermisporin inhibited 90% of staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, at 0.5 micrograms/ml (range 0.12-0.5 micrograms/ml). vermisporin mics for group a, b, c, f and g streptococci were < 1 microgram/ml when tested in haemophilus test medium but > or = 8 micrograms/ml in the presence of blood. vermisporin mics for enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and haemophilus influenzae exceeded 64 micrograms/ml. inhibited organisms had mbcs 16- to 32-fold above the mics.
in vitro evaluation of e1077, a new cephalosporin with a broad antibacterial spectrum.
e1077 is a novel parenteral cephalosporin with a wide spectrum of potent antibacterial activity against aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, e1077 was twice as active as cefpirome, with an mic for 90% of strains tested (mic90) of 0.78 micrograms/ml. methicillin-resistant s. aureus was moderately to highly resistant to e1077, but e1077 was at least twice as active as other beta-lactams tested. against enterococcus faecalis, e1077 was the most active of the cephalosporins tested (mic90, 12.5 micrograms/ml) and was at least fourfold more active than cefpirome and ceftazidime. at concentrations of less than or equal to 0.78 micrograms/ml, e1077 inhibited 90% of streptococci and most of the members of the family enterobacteriaceae tested, with the exceptions of serratia marcescens and proteus vulgaris, for which the mic90s of e1077 were both 3.13 micrograms/ml. against pseudomonas aeruginosa, e1077 was two- to fourfold more active than cefpirome and ceftazidime. for the anaerobes, e1077 was as active against bacteroides fragilis as was cefuzonam, and its activity was fourfold higher than those of cefpirome and ceftazidime. e1077 was at least as resistant as cefpirome to hydrolysis by various beta-lactamases, and these enzymes had a low affinity for e1077.
antimicrobial activities of piperacillin alone and in combination with tazobactam against beta-lactamase-producing bacteria.
tazobactam (ytr 830), a new beta-lactamase inhibitor, was evaluated for its effect in combination with piperacillin, a broad spectrum, but beta-lactamase sensitive, penicillin, against 14 common bacteria. a total of 1,086 clinical isolates from different clinical specimens were tested for beta-lactamase production by the rapid chromogenic cephalosporin method. their susceptibilities to piperacillin alone and in combination with tazobactam in a ratio of 8:1 by the agar dilution method were evaluated. the percentage of beta-lactamase producing strains ranged from 14.5% to 100% in these tested species. in general, the beta-lactamase producers were more resistant to piperacillin than the beta-lactamase nonproducers with higher minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics). for the beta-lactamase producers, tazobactam decreased the mics of piperacillin prominently in methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, neisseria gonorrhoeae, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, salmonella species and bacteroides fragilis, with a 4-fold or greater decrease in mic50, mic90 and the geometric mean of mic. for serratia marcescens and pseudomonas aeruginosa, the mics did not change after adding tazobactam. for other species, there was a moderate decrease in mics. we conclude that tazobactam is an effective beta-lactamase inhibitor for increasing the antimicrobial activity of piperacillin against beta-lactamase producing strains of many species of bacteria.
[antibacterial activity of ciprofloxacin against fresh clinical isolates from superficial suppurative foci].
the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of 5 drugs (ciprofloxacin (cpfx), and 4 drugs used as standard) were determined to investigate antibacterial potencies of cpfx against bacterial strains isolated in 1989 from superficial suppurative foci. the clinical isolates tested included 375 strains from 11 aerobic bacterial species, and 50 strains from 2 anerobic bacterial genera (group) for a total of 425 isolates. interpreting mic level distributions of these drugs as the expression of antibacterial potencies, the results are as follows. 1. when activities of new-quinolone antibiotics were tested, we found that, cpfx expressed far superior antibacterial potency to ofloxacin (oflx) and norfloxacin (nflx) against coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, pseudomonas aeruginosa and peptostreptococcus spp., although the activity of cpfx against bacteroides fragilis group was weaker than that of oflx, and cpfx had similar activity against staphylococcus aureus to oflx. 2. in comparison to beta-lactam antibiotics, cpfx was inferior to amoxicillin (ampc) against e. faecalis and inferior to ampc and cefaclor (ccl) against peptostreptococcus spp. against all other bacterial species, however, cpfx expressed superior antibacterial potency to ampc and ccl. 3. scattered findings of low sensitivity or resistance to cpfx were observed among the s. aureus, e. faecalis, e. faecium, p. vulgaris, m. morganii, p. aeruginosa and b. fragilis (group) species, but with an exception of e. faecium, the incidence of resistance strains was low.
[susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents. a study mainly focused on imipenem. reported by the research group for testing imipenem susceptibility on clinical isolates].
this study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (ipm) and other antibacterial agents at 64 hospital laboratories throughout japan from september to december of 1988. in this study, identification and susceptibility testing were carried out at each laboratory and the tests were performed according to the disk dilution method recommended by nccls in which susceptibilities are classified into "s", "ms", "i" and "r". ipm showed markedly high in vitro activities against streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, enterococcus faecalis, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, salmonella spp., citrobacter freundii, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia rettgeri, providencia stuartii, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis, alcaligenes spp., peptococcus spp./peptostreptococcus spp., bacteroides fragilis and bacteroides spp. ipm also had strong activities against achromobacter xylosoxidans and pseudomonas aeruginosa, but less active against flavobacterium spp., e. faecium, coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns), staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas cepacia. in a study in which activities of ipm against bacteria isolated from different clinical sources were compared, differences in susceptibilities were observed among s. aureus, cns, a. calcoaceticus and p. aeruginosa, but such differences were not apparent among s. pneumoniae, e. faecalis, h. influenzae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, c. freundii, s. marcescens or p. mirabilis.
[susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents. a study mainly focused on imipenem. research group for testing imipenem susceptibility on clinical isolates].
we investigated susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (ipm) and other antimicrobial agents at 459 hospital laboratories throughout japan from september to december of 1988. in this study, identification and susceptibility testing were performed at each hospital laboratory and the tests were carried out according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc technique in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, + and -. ipm had significantly high activity against streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, salmonella spp., citrobacter freundii, proteus mirabilis, providencia rettgeri, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, moraxella catarrhalis, alcaligenes spp., peptococcus spp./peptostreptococcus spp., bacteroides fragilis and bacteroides spp. and should slightly lower activities on coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns), enterococcus faecalis, haemophilus influenzae, serratia marcescens, proteus vulgaris, providencia stuartii and pseudomonas aeruginosa than on the above mentioned bacteria. in a comparative study on activities of ipm against bacteria from different clinical sources, no remarkable differences were found due to different sources among s. pneumoniae, e. faecalis, h. influenzae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, c. freundii, p. mirabilis or a. calcoaceticus, whereas slight differences were found among staphylococcus aureus, cns, s. marcescens and p. aeruginosa.
[in vitro activity of imipenem against hospital bacteria].
imipenem proved highly active against enterobacteriaceae: the different bacterial groups exhibited similar mode mics (0.12 to 0.25 micrograms/ml), except for serratia (0.25-0.5 micrograms/ml), proteus mirabilis (0.5 micrograms/ml), indole-positive proteus (2 micrograms/ml) and providencia (1 mu/ml). the mics of cefotaxime-resistant strains (cephalosporinase hyperproducing or very broad spectrum betalactamase producing) were within the susceptibility range. imipenem also exhibited satisfactory activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa (mode mic 1-2 micrograms/ml), although resistant strains by decrease of permeability were observed, and against acinetobacter (mode mic 0.25-0.5 micrograms/ml). the mics ranged from 0.03 to 4 micrograms/ml (mode mic 0.5) for haemophilus and from 0.25 to 1 micrograms/ml for neisseria gonorrhoeae, regardless of the betalactamase producing status. the mics for n. meningitidis were less than 0.06 micrograms/ml. methicillin-susceptible staphylococci had low mics ranging from 0.008 to 0.5 micrograms/ml (mode mic 0.016). the mics for methicillin-resistant strains varied widely from 0.016 to 64 micrograms/ml and were higher after incubation at 30 degrees c. streptococci and pneumococci were highly susceptible (usually 0.008 to 0.03 micrograms/ml). the mics for enterococci varied from 0.12 to 32 micrograms/ml (mode mic 1-2). with the exception of clostridium difficile, anaerobic bacteria were inhibited by concentrations lower than 1 (mode mic 0.06 for c. perfringens and 0.03 for bacteroides fragilis).
in-vitro activity of meropenem against clinical isolates obtained in canada.
the in-vitro activity of meropenem, a new parenteral carbapenem, was compared with that of imipenem, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, piperacillin, gentamicin and, where appropriate, other antibiotics against recent clinical isolates and characterized beta-lactamase producers. mics were determined by a standard agar dilution procedure and two inocula (10(4) and 10(6) cfu) were used throughout. meropenem inhibited 90% of isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, indole-positive proteus spp., enterobacter spp., serratia marcescens and providencia stuartii at less than or equal to 0.25 mg/l and was four- to 16-fold more active than imipenem against these species. against the enteric pathogens salmonella typhi, shigella sonnei, yersinia enterocolitica and campylobacter jejuni, meropenem was four- to eight-fold more active than imipenem, inhibiting all isolates at less than or equal to 0.03 mg/l. meropenem was also more active than imipenem against haemophilus influenzae (mic90 0.06 mg/l) but had similar activity against the bacteroides fragilis group (mic90 0.25 mg/l), against pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic90 2 mg/l) and against streptococci. imipenem was four-fold more active than meropenem against acinetobacter spp. and two- to eight-fold more active against all species of staphylococci tested. both meropenem and imipenem were inactive against ps. (xanthomonas) maltophilia.
in vitro activity of s-ofloxacin.
s-ofloxacin, the optically active form of ofloxacin, was twice as active as the s,r mixture of ofloxacin against members of the family enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and gram-positive species. of the enterobacteriaceae, 90% were inhibited by less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml and 90% of staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes isolates were inhibited by 0.5 microgram/ml. bacteroides fragilis was inhibited by 4 micrograms/ml. organisms resistant to ofloxacin were resistant to s-ofloxacin. like ofloxacin activity, the activity of s-ofloxacin was reduced by mg2+ and by acid ph. spontaneous mutational resistance to s-ofloxacin was similar to that to ofloxacin.
in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of bmy 40062, a new fluoronaphthyridone.
the in vitro and in vivo activities of a new naphthyridone, bmy 40062, were compared with those of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. bmy 40062 showed about threefold more activity than ciprofloxacin showed and four- to eightfold more activity than ofloxacin showed against staphylococci, streptococci, and enterococci. bmy 40062 showed generally twofold less activity than ciprofloxacin showed against most species of the family enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and acinetobacter spp. but twofold more activity than ofloxacin showed against these organisms. bmy 40062 and ofloxacin were more active than ciprofloxacin against bacteroides fragilis and clostridium difficile. the antiureaplasmal and antichlamydial activities of bmy 40062 were similar to those of the tetracyclines and were 4- and 16-fold, respectively, higher than those of ciprofloxacin. the in vitro activities of bmy 40062 were influenced by ph and magnesium, although these factors appeared to affect the activity of bmy 40062 against p. aeruginosa to a lesser extent than those of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. bmy 40062 was found to be bactericidal, and cross-resistance with other fluoroquinolones was observed. in mouse protection tests, the efficacy of bmy 40062 reflected its in vitro potency. bmy 40062 exhibited longer half-life, higher maximum concentration in serum, greater area under the curve, and better bioavailability in mice after oral dosing than ciprofloxacin. compared with ofloxacin, bmy 40062 had a lower maximum concentration in serum but a much longer half-life in mice. bmy 40062 was more effective than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin in penetrating mouse macrophages and killing macrophage-associated staphylococcus aureus.
in-vitro activity of a new penem fce 22101.
the in-vitro activity of a new penem fce 22101 was evaluated in comparison with other antimicrobial agents against 966 aerobic and anaerobic gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. fce 22101 inhibited 90% of enterobacteriaceae, haemophilus influenzae, h. parainfluenzae, h. ducreyi, neisseria gonorrhoeae, branhamella catarrhalis, staphylococcus aureus, staph. epidermidis and group b streptococcus at concentrations of 0.12-4.0 mg/l. pseudomonas aeruginosa was resistant with mic90 of greater than 32 mg/l. streptococcus faecalis displayed mic90 of 16 mg/l. bacteroides fragilis, clostridium spp., peptococcus spp. and peptostreptococcus spp. were inhibited at concentrations of 0.25-2.0 mg/l. beta-lactamase-producing or methicillin resistant bacteria did not have significantly elevated mics. fce 22101 was generally less active than imipenem but more active than other beta-lactam antibiotics examined.
in-vitro and in-vivo activities of t-3262, a new pyridone carboxylic acid.
t-3262[p-toluenesulfonic acid salt of dl-7-(3-amino-1-pyrrolidinyl)-1-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-6-fluoro-1, 4-dihydro-4-oxo-1, 8-naphthyridine-3-carboxylic acid monohydrate] is a new pyridone carboxylic acid with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. the activity of t-3262 against most enterobacteriaceae was comparable with that of ciprofloxacin except proteus spp. and providencia rettgeri and exceeded that of ofloxacin and norfloxacin. the activity of t-3262 against pseudomonas aeruginosa was comparable with that of ciprofloxacin, and t-3262 was more active than the other new quinolones against acinetobacter calcoaceticus, branhamella catarrhalis and haemophilus influenzae, and also against staphylococci, streptococci, and bacteroides fragilis. the protective effects of a single oral dose of t-3262 on systemic infection in mice were greater than norfloxacin. t-3262 was as effective as ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin against systemic infections in an animal model with escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae, and more active against ps. aeruginosa infections. t-3262 showed excellent activity against staphylococcal and streptococcal infections.
comparative in vitro activity of a new fluorinated 4-quinolone, t-3262 (a-60969).
the in vitro activity of a new quinolone, t-3262 [a-60969; dl-7-(3-amino-1-pyrrolidinyl)-1-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-6-fluoro-1-, 4-dihydro-4-oxo-1,8-naphthyridine-3-carboxylic acid monohydrate], was compared with those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, ceftazidime, imipenem, and gentamicin. t-3262 inhibited 90% of isolates of the family enterobacteriaceae at a concentration of less than or equal to 0.25 micrograms/ml. it was two to four times more active than ofloxacin and similarly or slightly less active than ciprofloxacin. ninety percent of isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa were inhibited at 0.5 micrograms/ml. it was 4- to 8-fold more active than ciprofloxacin and 8- to 16-fold more active than ofloxacin against pseudomonas cepacia and pseudomonas maltophilia, which were resistant to imipenem and gentamicin. most haemophilus influenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and branhamella catarrhalis isolates were inhibited at concentrations of less than or equal to 0.008 micrograms/ml. the mic for 90% of the staphylococcus aureus isolates, including methicillin-resistant s. aureus, was 0.12 micrograms/ml; that for staphylococcus epidermidis was 0.5 micrograms/ml, as was that for enterococcus faecalis. it inhibited 90% of bacteroides fragilis isolates at 2 micrograms/ml, considerably more active than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. the frequency of spontaneous point mutational resistance was less than 10(-10) for members of the family enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas spp. resistant strains could be selected by repeated subculture. similar to other quinolones, its activity could be affected by culture conditions. t-3262 showed a postantibiotic suppressive effect on escherichia coli, p. aeruginosa, and s. aureus.
a-61827 (a-60969), a new fluoronaphthyridine with activity against both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.
a-61827 (a-60969 is the hydrochloric salt of a-61827) is a new aryl-fluoronaphthyridine which is active against aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. the mics of a-61827 for 90% of strains (mic90) of staphylococci and streptococci were less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml and were generally 1 to 4 twofold dilutions less than those of ciprofloxacin for these bacteria. the mic90s of a-61827 for members of the family enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa were also less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml. ciprofloxacin was 1 to 3 twofold dilutions more active than a-61827 against these gram-negative bacteria. neisseria gonorrhoeae, campylobacter jejuni, and haemophilus influenzae were susceptible to less than 0.06 microgram of a-61827 per ml. the mic90 of a-61827 for legionella pneumophila was 0.25 microgram/ml. a-61827 was as potent or 1 to 2 twofold dilutions more potent than ciprofloxacin against these organisms. the mic90 of a-61827 for all anaerobic bacteria was less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml compared with less than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml for ciprofloxacin. in mouse protection tests, a-61827 was as active as ciprofloxacin against escherichia coli, p. aeruginosa, and salmonella typhimurium and 5 to 10 times more active than ciprofloxacin against staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes. a-61827 was as active as ciprofloxacin against p. aeruginosa in a mouse pyelonephritis model and more active than ciprofloxacin and metronidazole in a mouse bacteroides fragilis abscess model. after oral administration of 100 mg/kg to mice, the peak concentrations of a-61827 and ciprofloxacin in serum were 2.3 and 2.4 micrograms/ml and the half-lives in serum were 3.9 and 1.2 h, respectively.
in vitro studies of fleroxacin (ro 23-6240), a new trifluorinated quinolone derivative.
the in vitro activity of fleroxacin (ro 23-6240) against 441 bacterial isolates was compared with those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, amoxycillin, cefadroxil, cefuroxime and tobramycin. an agar dilution method was used for the determination of minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics). ciprofloxacin showed the highest activity against the enterobacteriaceae, 95% of the isolates were inhibited by 0.06 mg/l, but fleroxacin and ofloxacin were also highly active (mic 90% = 0.5 and 0.25 mg/l, respectively). ciprofloxacin was the most active agent against pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic 90% = 0.12 mg/l), whereas the activities of fleroxacin and ofloxacin were more variable. tobramycin was highly active against p. aeruginosa, 75% of the isolates were inhibited by 0.5 mg/l or less. the quinolones and tobramycin exhibited high activity against acinetobacter calcoaceticus, the great majority of the isolates being susceptible to 0.5 mg/l or less of any agent. all the quinolones showed high activity against staphylococcus aureus, but fleroxacin was less active against staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus saprophyticus than were the other derivatives. the pneumococcal and streptococcal isolates were markedly less susceptible to fleroxacin than to the other quinolones tested (mic range 4-32 mg/l). all isolates of haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae were inhibited by the lowest concentration of the quinolones employed in the study (0.03 mg/l). cefuroxime was also highly active against n. gonorrhoeae, whether the strains were beta-lactamase-producing or not, but was somewhat less active against h. influenzae. the quinolones displayed moderate and similar activity against bacteroides fragilis isolates (mic range 1-16 mg/l). the mics of fleroxacin against gram-negative rods were generally 4-16 times higher at ph 8.8 than those obtained at ph 5.8 and 7.3. the activity against gram-positive cocci was not markedly influenced by changes in ph.
comparative in vitro activity of ciprofloxacin against aerobic and anaerobic bacteria from clinical isolates.
1-cyclopropyl-6-fluoro-1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-7-piperazin-1- ylquinoline-3-carboxylic  acid (ciprofloxacin, bay o 9867, ciprobay) is a broad spectrum antibiotic of the 4-quinolone group. it possesses a bactericidal effect attributable to the property of dna-gyrase inhibition. the antimicrobial action comprises all grampositive strains (including streptococcus faecalis) and gramnegative strains (including pseudomonas aeruginosa and serratia spp.), as well as bacteroides fragilis and other bacteroides species. in this comparative study the antimicrobial effect of ciprofloxacin was tested against 665 gramnegative, 412 grampositive and 274 anaerobic strains from fresh clinical isolates and compared with that of other frequently used antibiotics. the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) were determined by means of a serial dilution test with micro standard plates. within the group of gramnegative strains, ciprofloxacin was the most active antibiotic with an mic90 of 0.12 mg/l to 0.5 mg/l for most isolates. ciprofloxacin shows a broad spectrum of activity against gramnegative pathogenic bacteria including escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., citrobacter spp., enterobacter spp., serratia spp. and acinetobacter spp., and also covers resistant strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa and alcaligenes faecalis. ciprofloxacin also shows a high inhibiting activity against grampositive strains (staphylococci, enterococci) and anaerobic pathogens.
the comparative in-vitro activity of eight newer quinolones and nalidixic acid.
the in-vitro antibacterial activity of nalidixic acid and the 4-quinolones, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, enoxacin, ofloxacin, pefloxacin, a-56619, a-56620 and ci-934 was assessed by determination of mics. the 4-quinolones were all highly active against most isolates of enterobacteriaceae, including nalidixic acid-resistant strains. ciprofloxacin (mics 0.002-2 mg/l) was the most active and a-56619 (mics 0.008-32 mg/l) was the least active. a-56619, a-56620, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and ci-934 were highly active against acinetobacter strains, pefloxacin and enoxacin were slightly less active, and a few strains were resistant to norfloxacin. all the compounds, including nalidixic acid, were active against aeromonas strains (mics 0.001-0.12 mg/l). ciprofloxacin (mics 0.06-1 mg/l) was the most active compound against pseudomonas aeruginosa; a-56619 and ci-934 (mics 1-16 mg/l) were the least active against this species. all the compounds were highly active against haemophilus influenzae, branhamella catarrhalis and neisseria gonorrhoeae but the activity of all the compounds was poor against most isolates of gardnerella vaginalis. all the 4-quinolones were active against staphylococci and ci-934 (mics 0.03-0.25 mg/l) was the most active. ci-934 (mics 0.06-2 mg/l) was also the most active compound against all streptococci. most streptococci were sensitive also to ciprofloxacin (mics 0.25-4 mg/l) but there were many isolates resistant to the other 4-quinolones. against the anaerobic bacteria ci-934 was again the most active compound, particularly against the gram-positive anaerobic cocci. pefloxacin, enoxacin and norfloxacin had poor activity against most anaerobes. ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, a-56619 and a-56620 had good to moderate activity against all species of anaerobes except the bacteroides fragilis group, against which none of the compounds was very active.
sepsis and cholestasis: the in vitro effects of bacterial products on 14c-taurocholate uptake by isolated rat hepatocytes.
bacterial endotoxins are known to be an important cause of cholestasis, yet not all organisms that cause cholestasis produce endotoxins. in order to determine whether bacterial products other than endotoxins may be involved in the cholestasis process, 14c-taurocholate (tc) uptake by isolated rat hepatocytes was measured in the presence of mid-log, stationary and mid-death phase bacterial broth supernatants from eight common bacterial pathogens. the results were then correlated with a quantitative assessment of endotoxin production by each organism. supernatants from haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and klebsiella pneumonia demonstrated a striking inhibitory effect on bile salt uptake (77.2 +/- 6.7, 46.9 +/- 6.5 and 32.9 +/- 7.1% maximum inhibition of 14c-tc uptake, respectively) when compared to sterile broth controls. streptococcus faecalis (enterococcus), escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus and bacteroides fragilis products, on the other hand, had relatively minor effects (12.3 +/- 5.2, 12.0 +/- 7.5, 8.4 +/- 6.7 and less than 5.0% inhibition respectively), while those from proteus mirabilis had an intermediate effect (18.5 +/- 8.3% inhibition). bile salt efflux rates (16.0 +/- 2.7 and 25.1 +/- 4.2 nmol/min/10(6) hepatocytes, mean +/- sem) were similar in bacteria demonstrating marked uptake inhibition (haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa) when compared to those with only minor inhibitory effects (staphylococcus aureus, bacteroides fragilis) (14.3 +/- 1.1 and 18.4 +/- 2.6 nmol/min/10(6) hepatocytes, respectively, p greater than 0.05). 14c-tc uptake inhibition did not correlate with the amount of endotoxin produced by each organism (r = 0.251). the results of this study indicate that bacteria produce a factor other than endotoxin that significantly inhibits bile salt uptake by isolated rat hepatocytes.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

aztreonam (azthreonam; sq 26,776) is the first member of a new class of beta-lactam antibiotics, the monobactams. aztreonam is selectively active against gram-negative aerobic bacteria and inactive against gram-positive bacteria. thus, in vitro, aztreonam is inhibitory at low concentrations (mic90 less than or equal to 1.6 mg/l) against enterobacteriaceae except enterobacter species, and is active against pseudomonas aeruginosa, 90% of pseudomonads being inhibited by 12 to 32 mg/l. aztreonam is inactive against gram-positive aerobic bacteria and anaerobes, including bacteroides fragilis. therefore, when administered alone, aztreonam has minimal effect on indigenous faecal anaerobes. aztreonam must be administered intravenously or intramuscularly when used to treat systemic infections, since absolute bioavailability is very low (about 1%) after oral administration. since elimination half-life is less than 2 hours, 6- or 8-hourly administration is used in the treatment of moderately severe or severe infections, although 12-hourly injection is adequate in less severe systemic and some urinary tract infections. therapeutic trials have shown aztreonam to be effective in gram-negative infections including complicated infections of the urinary tract, in lower respiratory tract infections and in gynaecological and obstetric, intra-abdominal, joint and bone, skin and soft tissue infections, uncomplicated gonorrhoea and septicaemia. in comparisons with other antibiotics, aztreonam has been at least as effective or more effective than cefamandole in urinary tract infections and similar in efficacy to tobramycin or gentamicin. where necessary, aztreonam and the standard drug have both been combined with another antibiotic active against gram-positive and/or anaerobic bacteria. aztreonam has been effective in eradicating pseudomonal infections in most patients (except in patients with cystic fibrosis), but the inevitably limited number of pseudomonal infections available for study prevents any conclusions as to the relative efficacy of aztreonam compared with other appropriate regimens against these infections. thus, with an antibacterial spectrum which differs from that of other antibiotics, aztreonam should be a useful alternative to aminoglycosides or 'third generation' cephalosporins in patients with proven or suspected serious gram-negative infections.
in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of carumonam (ama-1080), a new n-sulfonated monocyclic beta-lactam antibiotic.
the in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of carumonam (ama-1080), a synthetic sulfazecin derivative, were compared with those of aztreonam, cefoperazone, ceftazidime, and cefsulodin. carumonam was highly active in vitro against members of the family enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and haemophilus influenzae and weakly active against streptococcus pneumoniae, but it was not active against staphylococcus aureus. the mics of carumonam for 90% of 1,156 clinical enterobacteriaceae isolates were between 0.013 and 25 micrograms/ml, which were the lowest mics of the antibiotics tested. the mic of carumonam for 90% of klebsiella oxytoca was 0.2 micrograms/ml, whereas that of aztreonam was 50 micrograms/ml. the superiority of carumonam to aztreonam and the reference cephalosporins was also demonstrated by their activities against klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae. the mic of carumonam for 90% of p. aeruginosa was 12.5 micrograms/ml, which was comparable to the mics of aztreonam and ceftazidime. carumonam showed a high affinity for the penicillin-binding protein 3 of gram-negative bacteria, but not for the penicillin-binding proteins of s. aureus and bacteroides fragilis. carumonam was resistant to hydrolysis by 12 plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases and 7 chromosomal beta-lactamases. it was more stable than aztreonam to hydrolysis by the beta-lactamase of k. oxytoca; this stability is related to the superiority of the in vitro and in vivo activities of carumonam to those of aztreonam against this species. in general, the protective activities (50% effective dose) of carumonam and reference antibiotics in mice with experimental intraperitoneal infections correlated with the in vitro activities (mic); carumonam showed excellent protective activity against most aerobic gram-negative bacteria.
antibacterial activity of the pancreatic fluid.
the antibacterial activity of canine pancreatic fluid was investigated in an attempt to understand the resistance of this organ, when intact, to ascending bacterial infections. the pancreatic fluid demonstrated bactericidal activity against escherichia coli, shigella species, salmonella species, and klebsiella pneumoniae; bacteriostatic activity against coagulase-positive and coagulase-negative staphylococci and pseudomonas aeruginosa; and fungistatic activity against candida albicans. there was no demonstrable antibacterial activity against bacteroides fragilis and streptococcus faecalis. the antibacterial activity was dialyzable and ph dependent, but independent of heat, the activity of several digestive pancreatic enzymes, and the bacterial inoculum. electron micrographs of escherichia coli exposed to pancreatic fluid did not demonstrate changes in the bacterial cell wall. tracer studies of susceptible bacteria demonstrated decreased leucine uptake when briefly exposed to pancreatic fluid. the antibacterial activity was found by column chromatography to be a small molecular peptide. it is likely that pancreatic antibacterial factors protect the pancreas from ascending bacterial infections and operate along with other factors in the homeostasis of the upper small bowel flora.
in vitro and in vivo activities of dn-9550, a new broad-spectrum cephalosporin.
dn-9550 [(6r, 7r)-7-[(z)-2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-2-(1h-imidazol-4-yl) methoxyiminoacetamido]-3-[(1-pyridinio)methyl]-8-oxo-5-thia -1-azabicyclo methyl]-8-oxo-5-thia-1-azabicyclo[4.2.0]oct-2-ene-2-carboxylate hydrochloride] is a new semisynthetic cephalosporin with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. the activity of dn-9550 against most species of the family enterobacteriaceae was roughly comparable to that of ceftazidime, slightly lower than that of cefotaxime, and far exceeded that of cefoperazone. against citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, and serratia marcescens, dn-9550 was more active than ceftazidime and cefotaxime. dn-9550 and ceftazidime were significantly more active than cefotaxime against pseudomonas aeruginosa, but dn-9550 and cefotaxime were clearly more active than ceftazidime against staphylococci and streptococci. haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae were also highly susceptible to dn-9550, but bacteroides fragilis was generally not susceptible to the compound. dn-9550 was stable to various types of beta-lactamases and had high affinities for penicillin-binding protein 3 of both escherichia coli and p. aeruginosa. when dn-9550 was administered subcutaneously to mice experimentally infected with staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, or pseudomonas aeruginosa, its efficacy well reflected its in vitro potency.
hr 810 and bmy-28142, two new cephalosporins with broad-spectrum activity: an in-vitro comparison with other beta-lactam antibiotics.
the in-vitro activity of the new parenteral cephalosporins, hr 810 (hr) and bmy-28142 (bmy), was compared with that of other beta-lactam antibiotics, including cefotaxime, against a total of 315 recent clinical isolates and characterized beta-lactamase producers. an agar dilution procedure was used to determine mics and two inocula (10(4) and 10(6) cfu) were used throughout. against all species of the enterobacteriaceae tested, both hr and bmy were as active as, or slightly more active than, cefotaxime. hr differed from cefotaxime mainly in being eight-fold more active against pseudomonas aeruginosa and two-fold more active against staphylococcus aureus. bmy was also eight-fold more active than cefotaxime against ps. aeruginosa but was two-fold less active than the latter against staph. aureus. both new compounds had good activity against haemophilus influenzae, including the beta-lactamase producing strains of that species, and both had poor activity against the bacteroides fragilis group (mic90 greater than 128 mg/l).
temocillin. in vitro activity compared with other antibiotics.
temocillin is a recently developed penicillin with a methoxy group in the 6-alpha position. the in vitro activity of temocillin was studied using 932 recent clinical isolates of aerobic and anaerobic gram-negative bacilli and gram-positive cocci, and its activity was compared with that of other beta-lactam antibiotics. temocillin was active against the enterobacteriaceae, with narrow ranges of mics and mic90 values (less than or equal to 8 mg/l) for all isolates except serratia marcescens and enterobacter species. moreover, the compound was active against 46 multiresistant enterobacteriaceae strains. the drug was also strongly active against haemophilus influenzae, with beta-lactamase-producing strains being as susceptible as non-beta-lactamase-producing strains. temocillin showed no useful activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter or gram-positive cocci, and had only discrete activity against the bacteroides fragilis group. in general, temocillin displayed the same spectrum of activity against enterobacteriaceae as third generation cephalosporins, but with a substantially lower intrinsic activity.
the activity of enoxacin against clinical bacterial isolates in comparison with that of five other agents, and factors affecting that activity.
the activity of enoxacin against 362 clinical bacterial isolates in comparison with norfloxacin, nalidixic acid, ampicillin, latamoxef (moxalactam) and gentamicin was tested by an agar dilution method. typical mics for enterobacteria lay between 0.12 and 1.0 mg/l. enterobacter spp. and serratia spp. tended to be more resistant. enoxacin was also active against pseudomonas aeruginosa (mean mic 0.5 mg/l) and highly active against fastidious gram-negative aerobes. typical mics for staphylococcus aureus were 1-2 mg/l while streptococci were more resistant (16-32 mg/l). enoxacin had no useful activity against bacteroides fragilis and clostridium perfringens. enoxacin was generally more active at ph 8 than ph 6, and in broth than in urine. it was bactericidal in its action. daily serial passage from growth in broth containing enoxacin caused decreased sensitivity which was limited to four- to 16-fold greater than the original mic. enoxacin was about half as active as norfloxacin against enterobacteria, equally active against staphylococci, and some two to four times less active against streptococci.
activity of cefotaxime against enterococci.
the third-generation cephalosporins as a group are characterized by spectra of activity that are the broadest of the currently available antibiotics (farber and moellering, 1982). these agents provide excellent coverage of infections due to enterobacteriaceae. they also exhibit good (but variable) activity against a number of "nonfermentors" such as pseudomonas aeruginosa, and many of them are likewise active against anaerobes, including bacteroides fragilis (farber and moellering, 1982). as a class, the third generation cephalosporins are less active against gram-positive organisms, but in spite of this they have been clinically effective against infections due to s. aureus and many other gram-positive cocci (saito, 1982). enterococci, however, have proven to be a difficult organism for the third-generation cephalosporins. none of the presently available compounds exhibits very good activity against these organisms in vitro (fass, 1983). given this fact and the broad spectrum of activity of these compounds against other organisms, there is a significant potential for enterococcal superinfection in patients treated with the third-generation cephalosporins. indeed, serious enterococcal infection has clearly been documented in patients treated with some third-generation cephalosporins (moellering, 1982; yu, 1981). although none of the presently available third-generation cephalosporins exhibits therapeutically useful activity against enterococci, currently available data suggest that there may be differences among these compounds in their ability to cause (or prevent) this complication. for instance, there are more published reports of enterococcal superinfection in patients treated with moxalactam than in patients receiving the other third-generation cephalosporins.(abstract truncated at 250 words)
ciprofloxacin, a quinolone carboxylic acid compound active against aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.
the in vitro activity of ciprofloxacin, a quinolone-carboxylic acid derivative, was compared with those of norfloxacin, cefotaxime, cephalexin, ceftazidime, moxalactam, amoxicillin, and methicillin and other agents, as appropriate. the mics of ciprofloxacin for 90% of members of the family enterobacteriaceae and for pseudomonas aeruginosa, neisseria spp., and bacteroides fragilis were between 0.005 and 0.8 micrograms/ml, whereas streptococci and staphylococci were all inhibited by less than or equal to 6.3 micrograms/ml. ciprofloxacin was 4- to 32-fold more active than norfloxacin and inhibited gentamicin-, ameikacin-, cefotaxime-, and moxalactam-resistant members of the family enterobacteriaceae and p. aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. the activity of ciprofloxacin was not affected by serum but decreased in the presence of acid urine. the frequency of resistance to ciprofloxacin was between 10(-7) and 10(-9).
comparative in vitro activities of third-generation cephalosporins.
the in vitro susceptibilities of 823 clinical isolates to eight third-generation  cephalosporin and cephalosporinlike antibiotics were studied. all eight antibiotics were more active and had broader spectrums of activity against gram-negative bacilli and anaerobes than older derivatives; however, they were less active against gram-positive cocci. cefotaxime sodium, cefmenoxime hydrochloride, ceftriaxone disodium, and ceftizoxime sodium had similar activities. cefoperazone sodium was more active than those drugs against pseudomonas aeruginosa but less active against enterobacteriaceae and acinetobacter. ceftazidime pentahydrate was more active against p aeruginosa but less active against gram-positive cocci. moxalactam disodium was more active against some enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas maltophilia, and bacteroides fragilis but less active against gram-positive cocci. thienamycin formamidide monohydrate had the broadest spectrum of activity and was the only antibiotic active against streptococcus faecalis; the only resistant species were p maltophilia and pseudomonas cepacia.
n-formimidoyl thienamycin: in vitro comparison with cefoxitin and tobramycin against clinical, bacterial isolates.
the in vitro activity of the novel beta-lactam antibiotic, n-formimidoyl thienamycin (n-f thienamycin) has been compared with those of cefoxitin and tobramycin. an agar dilution method was employed. n-f thienamycin was active against all enterobacteriaceae isolates (mic less than or equal to 4 mg/l). all pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were inhibited by 2 mg/l. n-f thienamycin was also active against acinetobacter calcoaceticus (96 per cent inhibited by 0.5 mg/l) and gram-positive cocci. all enterococci were inhibited by 2 mg/l. the drug was active against haemophilus influenzae (mic less than or equal to 1 mg/l) and the bacteroides fragilis group (mic less than or equal to 0.5 mg/l). cefoxitin was inactive against most enterobacter and a. calcoaceticus isolates and all p. aeruginosa and enterococcal isolates. tobramycin was virtually inactive against gram-positive cocci other than staphylococcus aureus. n-f thienamycin thus has a broad spectrum of in vitro activity, greater than that of cefoxitin and tobramycin, and may therefore be useful in the treatment of serious infection, particularly when the aetiology is unknown.
comparative in-vitro activity of temocillin (brl 17421), a new penicillin.
the activity in vitro of the new parenteral penicillin, temocillin, was determined by an agar dilution technique at two inocula against 201 recent clinical isolates and also against reference strains that produced characterized beta-lactamases. ampicillin, ticarcillin, latamoxef (moxalactam) and cefoxitin were used as comparative agents. temocillin showed no useful activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa or the bacteroides fragilis group but was highly active against the enterobacteriaceae, inhibiting all isolates (serratia marcescens excepted) at less than or equal to 8 mg/l. the mic50 and mic90 were usually within one dilution and results with both inoculum sizes were similar. temocillin also had good activity against haemophilus influenzae and beta-lactamase producing strains were as susceptible as non-beta-lactamase producers. neither for the enterobacteriaceae nor for h. influenzae did a 1000-fold increase in inoculum result in a greater than two-fold increase in mic. the above results implied excellent stability to beta-lactamases and this was borne out by the activity of temocillin against strains containing chromosomal cephalosporinases, the 'broad-spectrum' class iv enzyme and the plasmid mediated enzymes tem-1, oxa-1 and shv-1. the protein binding of temocillin was found to be 87%.
cefotetan: in-vitro antibacterial activity and susceptibility to beta-lactamases.
the in-vitro antibacterial activity of cefotetan was assessed against recent clinical isolates of common bacteria and also against reference strains that produced known beta-lactamases. the compound was active against most staphylococci (mics 4 to 8 mg/l) though methicillin-resistant strains were less sensitive. it was also generally active against streptococci (mics mostly in the range 1 to 16 mg/l). however, enterococci and penicillin-resistant pneumococci were resistant. cefotetan was highly active against enterobacteria, with 75% of isolates inhibited by 0.5 mg/l and 90% inhibited by 4 mg/l. it was also highly active against haemophilus influenzae (mics 0.5 to 4 mg/l) and neisseria gonorrhoeae (mics 0.06 to 2 mg/l) but had relatively poor activity against acinetobacter spp. (mics mostly 4 to 128 mg/l). cefotetan had little useful activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa (mics 16 to 512 mg/l) but was more active against most other pseudomonads. cefotetan had moderate activity against the bacteroides fragilis group (mics mostly less than or equal to 32 mg/l), though bact. fragilis sensu stricto and bact. vulgatus were more sensitive (mics usually less than or equal to 4 mg/l). it was more active against most other anaerobes, though its activity was always exceeded by that of ampicillin. cefotetan possessed a high degree of resistance to both plasmid-mediated and chromosomally-determined beta-lactamases.
in-vitro antibacterial activity of cefotetan.
the in-vitro activity of cefotetan, a recently developed cephamycin, was investigated under various experimental conditions. the compound showed moderate activity against staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes, no activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa and streptococcus faecalis, but a high activity against enterobacteriaceae, including beta-lactamase-producing strains. haemophilus influenzae also was fairly susceptible. the mbc was usually equal to or two- or fourfold higher than mic. medium composition, ph and inoculum size had minimal influence on its activity. about 50% of recent clinical isolates of bacteroides fragilis were susceptible to cefotetan, but some were highly resistant. killing curves of cefotetan against different bacterial strains indicated that it was rapidly bactericidal at concentrations equal to mic or two- to fourfold higher. however, some strains showed regrowth after initial inhibition. combination of cefotetan with aminoglycosides, or with cefazolin, cefotaxime, moxalactam or piperacillin resulted either in synergy, addition or indifference according to the bacterial strain and the nature of the combination. antagonism was never observed. human serum protein binding varied from 75 to 86% according to the assay method. binding with horse serum protein was about 28%.
antibacterial activity of the cephamycin cefotetan: an in-vitro comparison with other beta-lactam antibiotics.
the cephamycin, cefotetan, was compared with other beta-lactam antibiotics including the monocyclic beta-lactam, azthreonam, against a total of 277 recent clinical isolates. cefotetan had activity comparable to moxalactam against staphylococcus aureus and against the enterobacteriaceae, inhibiting all isolates except for serratia marcescens and enterobacter spp. at less than or equal to 0.5 mg/l. cefotetan was active against beta-lactamase producing and non-beta-lactamase producing haemophilus influenzae (mic90 1 mg/l); was inactive against pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic90 greater than 128 mg/l); and was eightfold less active than cefoxitin against the bacteroides fragilis group. azthreonam was as active as moxalactam against the enterobacteriaceae and was more active than moxalactam against ps. aeruginosa, inhibiting 90% of isolates at less than or equal to 8 mg/l, but was inactive against the bact. fragilis group (mic90 greater than 128 mg/l) and against staphylococcus aureus (mic90 greater than 128 mg/l).
in vitro activity of ceftazidime and ceftriaxone.
the in vitro susceptibility of 230 clinical isolates, including 55 anaerobic bacteria, was tested with ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, cefoperazone, moxalactam, cefamandole, cefoxitin, and ticarcillin. ceftazidime was the most active drug against pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter sp. against enterobacteriaceae, ceftazidime and ceftriaxone were similar to cefotaxime, moxalactam, and cefoperazone and more active than cefamandole, cefoxitin, and ticarcillin. cefoxitin and moxalactam were significantly more active against bacteroides fragilis than were the other beta-lactam drugs. against staphylococcus aureus, ceftriaxone showed moderate activity, while ceftazidime was relatively inactive. these results indicate a potential role for ceftazidime and ceftriaxone against infections involving facultative and aerobic gram-negative bacilli.
in vitro activity of azthreonam, a monobactam antibiotic.
we studied the activity of azthreonam (sq 26,776), a novel monocyclic beta-lactam compound, against a variety of clinical isolates. it was more potent than moxalactam, cefoperazone, cefamandole, cefoxitin, ticarcillin, tobramycin, or amikacin against strains of klebsiella spp., serratia spp., and the proteus group. it was highly effective against escherichia coli and strains of salmonella spp. the median minimal inhibitory concentration for all species of enterobacteriaceae was less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml. azthreonam was moderately active against pseudomonas aeruginosa, including tobramycin-resistant strains, and against pseudomonas cepacia (median minimal inhibitory concentration, 16 to 32 micrograms/ml), but was weakly active against pseudomonas maltophilia and strains of acinetobacter spp. and achromobacter spp. the drug showed little activity against staphylococcus aureus, enterococci, and anaerobic bacteria, including bacteroides fragilis, clostridium spp., and gram-positive cocci. like moxalactam and cefoperazone, azthreonam exhibited a considerable inoculum effect with strains of enterobacter spp. and pseudomonas spp. combination with clavulanic acid did not increase the activity of azthreonam against s. aureus but was synergistic for 5 of 15 strains of b. fragilis. azthreonam is about 50% bound to human serum protein. the selective range of activity of this compound could be of clinical benefit.
moxalactam in serious infections: clinical, bacteriologic, and pharmacokinetic studies.
moxalactam was evaluated in vitro against 600 nosocomial isolates of gram-negative bacteria and was compared with cephalothin, cefoxitin, and cefotaxime. moxalactam was superior to the other compounds, with minimal inhibitory concentrations of less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml for 95% of the enterobacteriaceae isolates and less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml for 85% of the bacteroides fragilis isolates; 70% of the pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were inhibited with less than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml. moxalactam at doses ranging from 1 g every 12 hr to 2 g every 8 hr was given to patients with serious infections of the respiratory (14) or urinary (13) tract, abdominal abscess (4), osteomyelitis (4), meningitis (5), soft-tissue phlegmon (3), malignant external otitis (2), peritonitis (1), and panophthalmitis (1). the clinical response was excellent in 35 (74.5%) and improved in 12 (25.5%) of the 47 patients. the pathogen was eradicated in 29 (61.7%) patients, two patients had relapses, and bacteria persisted but in decreased numbers and without development of resistance in 16 patients. the half-life of moxalactam was 146 (+/- 21) and 125 (+/- 34) min after 2-g intravenous and 1-g intramuscular doses, respectively. kinetic studies in sputum, bile, bone, aqueous humor, prostatic fluid, and cerebrospinal fluid showed moxalactam concentrations several times higher than the required mics. no appreciable adverse effects or toxicity were observed.
in vitro activity of apalcillin compared with that of other new penicillins and anti-pseudomonas cephalosporins.
apalcillin, a naphthydridine derivative of ampicillin, was compared with ticarcillin, azlocillin, mezlocillin, piperacillin, cefotaxime, and cefoperazone against gram-negative and gram-positive bacterial isolates and with cefsulodin and tobramycin against pseudomonas aeruginosa. the minimal concentrations of apalcillin at which 50 and 90% of hospital isolates of escherichia coli were inhibited were similar to those of mezlocillin and piperacillin (1.6 and 100 micrograms/ml, respectively). apalcillin had minimal inhibitory concentrations similar to those of piperacillin against citrobacter freundii and citrobacter diversus. against klebsiella, apalcillin inhibited 50% of organisms at a concentration of 6.3 micrograms/ml, similar to piperacillin. the activity of apalcillin against enterobacter (e. aerogenes, e. cloacae, and e. agglomerans) was similar to that of mezlocillin and piperacillin and greater than that of ticarcillin. the activity of apalcillin against proteus mirabilis was similar to that of the other agents, as was its activity against indole-positive proteus and providencia. only 40% of serratia were inhibited at an apalcillin concentration of 25 micrograms/ml. apalcillin was as active as piperacillin but twofold less active than cefoxitin or moxalactam against bacteroides fragilis. it was as active as piperacillin, cefoperazone, and cefsulodin against p. aeruginosa (apalcillin inhibited 90% of organisms at a concentration of 25 mg/ml). there was an inoculum effect and a difference in the minimal inhibitory concentration and minimal bactericidal concentration with beta-lactamase strains. apalcillin was hydrolyzed by plasmid beta-lactamase but not as well by cephalosporinases.
comparative review of two new wide-spectrum penicillins: mezlocillin and piperacillin.
the antimicrobial spectra, pharmacokinetics, tissue penetration, side effects, clinical trials and indications, dosage, and cost of mezlocillin (mezlin) and piperacillin (pipracil), two new semisynthetic beta-lactam penicillins, are reviewed. both mezlocillin and piperacillin are active against a wider range of bacteria than previously available penicillins, but their spectra are not identical. piperacillin is more active than mezlocillin against pseudomonas aeruginosa; their activities against klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus faecalis, and bacteroides fragilis are similar to one another. neither drug is absorbed orally; both are well absorbed (60-70%) after i.m. injection. following i.v. infusion or injection, both drugs distribute rapidly (distribution half-life = 10-20 min); neither is protein bound substantially. both drugs are primarily excreted unchanged in the urine by glomerular filtration and tubular secretion. elimination half-lives of both drugs are slightly prolonged in renal-failure patients. however, the half-life of mezlocillin in renal failure is longer then the half-life of piperacillin because of dose-dependent kinetics of mezlocillin at low glomecular filtration rates. probenecid alters the disposition of both drugs. both drugs are widely distributed throughout the body. reported side effects are similar to those of other penicillins. mezlocillin and piperacillin may be used to treat susceptible organisms causing the following conditions: complicated and uncomplicated urinary-tract infections, septicemia, uncomplicated gonococcal urethritis, and lower respiratory-tract, intra-abdominal, gynecologic, skin, and skin-structure infections. piperacillin is also effective for bone and joint infections. dosages of both antibiotics should be adjusted based on patients' clinical condition and renal status. both agents are relatively expensive in comparison with older penicillins and cephalosporins; their daily costs are similar to third-generation cephalosporins, carbenicillin, and ticarcillin. the potential benefits of mezlocillin and piperacillin are in their extended in vitro spectra of activity and minimal toxicities. more comparative clinical trials are needed to support any claims of clinical superiority of these drugs over older, less expensive regimens.
in-vitro studies with ceftazidime against aerobic gram-negative bacilli and bacteroides fragilis group.
the in-vitro susceptibility of recent clinical isolates of gram-negative bacilli  has been assessed for ceftazidime and compared to amikacin, gentamicin, carbenicillin, piperacillin, cefoperazone, moxalactam, ceftriaxone and ceftizoxime. using the ics-who agar dilution method, we found that ceftazidime was the most active beta-lactam agent tested against 147 isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa, with a mode mic=2 mg/l and all but 2% of isolates inhibited at 32 mg/l. 100% of indole-positive and negative proteus spp., 90% of citrobacter spp., 100% of acinetobacter spp. and 98% of enterobacter spp. were inhibited. a total of 142 isolates from the latter 5 groups of organisms were tested. cefoperazone and moxalactam were slightly more active by weight than ceftazidime versus enterobacter spp., but against other gram-negative bacilli ceftazidime was similar or more potent. additionally, 72 clinical isolates of bacteroides fragilis group were tested against ceftazidime, cefoperazone, ceftizoxime, ceftriaxone, and cefoxitin. against these organisms cefoxitin and ceftizoxime were most active. ceftazidime demonstrates potent in-vitro activity against ps. aeruginosa and enterobacteriaceae, but it is relatively less active against bacteroides fragilis group than cefoxitin and ceftizoxime.
ceftazidime: in-vitro antibacterial activity and susceptibility to beta-lactamases compared with that of cefotaxime, moxalactam and other beta-lactam antibiotics.
the in-vitro antibacterial activity of ceftazidime was assessed against recent clinical isolates of common bacteria and also against reference strains that produced known beta-lactamases. the compound was active, though less so than cephaloridine against staphylococci and streptococci with mics mostly 0.12-2 mg/l for streptococci and 8 mg/l for staphylococci, but enterococci (mics > or =64 mg/l) and methicillin-resistant staphylococci (mics 16-32 mg/l) were resistant. penicillin-resistant pneumococci (mics 2-4 mg/l) were much less sensitive than other pneumococci (mics 0.12-0.25 mg/l). ceftazidime was also active, but slightly less so than cefotaxime or moxalactam, against enterobacteria (mics mostly 0.12-0.25 mg/l). its activity was also inferior to that of cefotaxime against neisseria gonorrhoeae (mics mostly 0.03-0.06 mg/l) and haemophilus influenzae (mics mostly 0.06-0.25 mg/l). however it was about eightfold more active than cefotaxime or moxalactam against pseudomonas aeruginosa (mics mostly 1-4 mg/l), and it was also more active than these compounds against other pseudomonads. ceftazidime was less active than cefoxitin against bacteroides spp. (mics mostly 16-64 mg/l for bact. fragilis and 2-8 mg/l for other bacteroides) and less active than ampicillin or cefoxitin against other anaerobes. the compound was highly resistant to hydrolysis by most beta-lactamases including oxa-1 and the enzymes from klebsiella 1082e and proteus vulgaris pc37 which hydrolyse cefuroxime and cefotaxime. however, it was hydrolysed slowly by the enzyme from a highly ampicillin-resistant isolate of bact. fragilis.
comparative in vitro activity of first, second and third generation cephalosporins.
minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) were determined against 662 recent clinical isolates for eight cephalosporins representing first, second and third generation compounds. all four third-generation cephalosporins tested (cefoperaxone, cefotaxime, ceftazidime and moxalactam) were significantly more active against aerobic gram-negative bacteria than the older compounds (cephalothin, cefamandole, cefoxitin, and cefuroxime). cefotaxime and moxalactam were most active against enterobacteriaceae with extremely low mic-values. ceftazidime was definitely most active against pseudomonas aeruginosa with more than 90% of strains inhibited at 4 micro g/ml. mic-values for cefotaxime against staphylococcus aureus were for all strains 1-2 micro g/ml, slightly higher for cefoperazone, while the effect of ceftazidime and moxalactam was more limited. all third generation cephalosporins demonstrated efficiency against streptococcus pyogenes, cefotaxime being most active and moxalactam least active, but were essentially ineffective against streptococcus faecalis. moxalactam demonstrated higher activity against bacteroides fragilis than other second and third generation cephalosporins including cefoxitin. previous studies have demonstrated a very high activity of all third generation cephalosporins against haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae, including beta-lactamase producing strains.
brl 17421, a novel beta-lactam antibiotic, highly resistant to beta-lactamases, giving high and prolonged serum levels in humans.
brl 17421 is a new semisynthetic beta-lactam antibiotic with an unusual spectrum  of antibacterial activity. the compound exhibits exceptional stability to a wide range of bacterial beta-lactamases and is active against the majority of enterobacteriaceae, including strains highly resistant to many of the penicillins and cephalosporins currently available. among the clinical isolates of enterobacteriaceae tested, the frequency of strains resistant to brl 17421 was found to be low, and there was a slow rate of emergence of resistance during in vitro studies. brl 17421 was highly active against haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae, including beta-lactamase-producing strains. the compound was markedly less active against pseudomonas aeruginosa and bacteroides fragilis than against the enterobacteriaceae. against the gram-positive bacteria, brl 17421 showed a very low level of activity. brl 17421 was found to be 85% bound to human serum, and the antibacterial activity was diminished two- to fourfold in the presence of human serum. against experimental infections in mice, the activity of brl 17421 reflected the properties observed in vitro. studies in human volunteers showed unusually high and prolonged serum concentrations of the compound after parenteral dosage, with a serum half-life of about 5 h, and approximately 85% of the dose was recovered unchanged in the urine. brl 17421 was poorly absorbed after oral administration. the compound was well tolerated after intramuscular and intravenous administration in volunteers, with no adverse side effects.
comparative in vitro studies of ro 13-9904, a new cephalosporin derivative.
the in vitro activity of ro 13-9904, a new cephalosporin derivative, was compared with the activities of cephalothin, cefamandole, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, and moxalactam against 591 clinical isolates of gram-negative and gram-positive organisms. the spectra of activity and potency of ro 13-9904 and cefotaxime were quite similar; they were the most active agents against enterobacteriaceae, streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and neisseria meningitidis. moxalactam was only slightly less active against these organisms. ro 13-9904, cefotaxime, and moxalactam were approximately equal in activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa; concentrations of 50 to 100 microgram/ml inhibited over 90% of the strains tested. cefamandole and cephalothin were the most active drugs tested against staphylococci. moxalactam demonstrated the highest intrinsic activity against bacteroides fragilis; a concentration of 1.6 microgram/ml inhibited over 50% of the strains. all six of the antibiotics were essentially inactive against group d streptococci. the action of all of the antibiotics was bactericidal, with minimal bactericidal concentrations generally being no more than twofold greater than minimal inhibitory concentrations. the only exception to this was found when large inocula of staphylococcus aureus were tested. increased inoculum size generally sharply reduced the activity of ro 13-9904, cefotaxime, and moxalactam against enterobacteriaceae and p. aeruginosa.
in vitro comparison of three new cephalosporins: ly-127935, cefotaxime and cefoperazone.
the comparative in vitro activity of three new cephalosporin antibiotics ly-127935 (ly), cefotaxime (ctx) and cefoperazone (cfp) was examined. ly, ctx and cfp had similar activity against staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis while cfp was less inhibitory than ly or ctx against klebsiella spp.; indole + proteus and gentamicin (gm)-susceptible serratia. ly and ctx were effective while cfp was inactive against enterobacter spp. and gm-resistant serratia. cfp was more active than ly or ctx against gm-susceptible pseudomonas aeruginosa but was the least active agent against gm-resistant isolates. bacteroides fragilis were more susceptible to ly than ctx or cfp. combination studies against p. aeruginosa with cephalosporin-gm pairs demonstrated synergy.
activity of mecillinam alone and in combination with other beta-lactam antibiotics.
the in vitro activities of mecillinam, ticarcillin, cefamandole, and cefoxitin, singly and in all possible combinations, against 53 clinical isolates were studied by a checkerboard method of determining minimal inhibitory concentrations. for selected representative strains, bactericidal activity was determined by minimal bactericidal concentrations and killing curves. mecillinam was the least active antibiotic against gram-positive cocci, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and bacteroides fragilis and the most active against enterobacteriaceae. reproducibility of mecillinam minimal inhibitory concentrations for susceptible enterobacteriaceae was often poor, however, due to minor variations in inoculum size. when mecillinam resistance was observed with enterobacteriaceae, partial inhibition could be demonstrated at concentrations below minimal inhibitory concentrations, and bacterial cells were consistently ovoid or round; under those conditions the addition of a second study antibiotic resulted in marked synergistic inhibition and killing which was independent of inoculum size and susceptibility to the second antibiotic. in contrast, synergy with mecillinam against mecillinam-susceptible strains or with other antibiotic combinations against any species was not consistently observed.
comparative in vitro appraisal of piperacillin, including its activity against salmonella typhi.
piperacillin was evaluated in vitro against 711 clinical isolates of aerobic and  anerobic gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including 76 isolates of salmonella typhi. piperacillin minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) were compared with those of a range of beta-lactam, aminoglycoside, and other antimicrobial agents, and inoculum size effects were considered. the relationship between dilution and disk diffusion tests was studied by regression analysis. in addition, piperacillin was assessed in combination with aminoglycoside and other beta-lactam drugs. this investigation has confirmed the activity of piperacillin against a broad range of bacteria, including pseudomonas, enterobacteriaceae, neisseria, beta-lactamase-negative haemophilus influenzae, and staphylococcus aureus as well as enterococci, bacteroides fragilis, and other anaerobes. all strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa were inhibited by </=32 mug/ml or less, demonstrating again the potential usefulness of piperacillin in the treatment of pseudomonal infections. s. typhi proved susceptible to piperacillin, all isolates being inhibited by 1 mug/ml. inoculum size experiments showed that inocula of 10(8) cfu resulted in mics and mbcs appreciably higher than those resulting from inocula of 10(6) cfu, and inocula of 10(2) cfu resulted in mics and mbcs appreciably lower than those resulting from inocula of 10(4) cfu. piperacillin was active against all gentamicin-resistant pseudomonads tested, but not against gentamicin-resistant klebsiellas and enterobacters. combinations of piperacillin with tobramycin and amikacin were consistently synergistic against pseudomonas and serratia isolates. less consistent results were shown when piperacillin was combined with aminoglycosides or cephalothin against klebsiella and indole-positive proteus isolates, although synergy was observed in most cases. occasional antagonistic reactions were encountered with piperacillin-cephalothin or piperacillin-tobramycin combinations against the latter isolates.
in vitro antibacterial activity and susceptibility of the cephalosporin ro 13-9904 to beta-lactamases.
the in vitro activity of ro 13-9904 was assessed against clinical isolated of common bacteria. its activity against most enterobacteria was similar to that of cefotaxime and moxalactam, but it was even more active than these compounds against all proteus species. it was also highly active against haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae, including beta-lactamase producers. like cefotaxime and moxalactam, or 13-9904 was approximately eightfold more active than carbenicillin against most isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa and also active against highly carbenicillin-resistant isolates, but it was relatively inactive against moderately carbenicillin-resistant isolates. ro 13-9904 also resembled cefotaxime and moxalactam in that it was active, though less so than cephaloridine, against staphylococci and streptococci, except for methicillin-resistant staphylococci and streptococcus faecalis, which were resistant to it. it was less active than cefoxitin but slightly more active than ampicillin against both bacteroides fragilis and other bacteroides spp. ro 13-9904 was resistant to most beta-lactamases but was attacked by enzymes from b. fragilis, isolates of indole-positive proteus species, and also by a cefoxitin-hydrolyzing enzyme from an isolate of enterobacter cloacae.
comparison of in vitro activity of moxalactam (ly127935) with cefazolin, amikacin, tobramycin, carbenicillin, piperacillin, and ticarcillin against 420 blood culture isolates.
to compare the in vitro activity of moxalactam (ly127935), a new broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent, with cefazolin, amikacin, tobramycin, carbenicillin, piperacillin, and ticarcillin, each drug was tested against 420 bacterial isolates from the blood of septic patients. standard broth dilution methods were used to determine minimum inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations. ly127935 was as active as the aminoglycosides against aerobic gram-negative organisms, including pseudomonas aeruginosa, and was at least 10-fold more active than the other beta-lactam agents against these bacteria. ly127935 was the most active agent tested against bacteroides fragilis; its activity against all other anaerobic bacteria and staphylococcus aureus was similar to those of the other agents tested. all streptococci, however, grew at higher concentrations of ly127935 than any other drug, and streptococcus faecalis and listeria monocytogenes were not inhibited at the highest concentration tested (minimum inhibitory concentration, > 64 microgram/ml). although a greater proportion of blood culture isolates were susceptible to ly127935 than to any other drug tested, ly127935 does not have a sufficiently broad spectrum of in vitro activity to be recommended safely alone for empirical treatment of sepsis of unknown etiology.
activity of the cefotaxime (hr756) desacetyl metabolite compared with those of cefotaxime and other cephalosporins.
the desacetyl metabolite (des) of cefotaxime (hr756) is formed in vivo to a significant extent. the in vitro activities of des, the parent compound, and cefazolin, cefoxitin, and cefuroxime were compared against 70 bacterial isolates. des was found to possess approximately 1/10th the activity of the parent compound against the common enterobacteriaceae, but was somewhat more active than the other three compounds tested. des had no useful activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa and was less active than cefotaxime or cefoxitin against staphylococcus aureus or bacteroides fragilis. because des may accumulate in renal failure or be concentrated in the biliary tract, its antimicrobial activity may have considerable clinical significance.
ly127935, a novel oxa-beta-lactam: an in vitro comparison with other beta-lactam  antibiotics.
the in vitro activities of ly127935 (ly) were compared with those of other beta-lactam antibiotics. ly was highly active (minimal inhibitory concentration [mic] range 0.06 to 0.25 micrograms/ml) against the common enterobacteriaceae (including providencia stuartiia, enterobacter, and serrati marcescens), 8 to 16 times more active than cefoxitin, cefuroxime, or cefazolin, and from one-half to one-eighth as active as cefotaxime (hr756). the activity of ly against pseudomonas aeruginosa (with mics of 4 and 64 micrograms/ml for 50 and 90% of test strains, respectively) was essentially similar to that of cefotaxime, but was only one-half as active as cgp 7174/e. ly, cefoxitin, and cefotaxime were essentially equally active against bacteroides fragilis--each was more active than cefuroxime and cefazolin. against staphylococcus aureus, ly (50% mic and 90% mic of 4 and 16 micrograms/ml, respectively) was less active than cefotaxime, cefoxitin, or cefuroxime and one-eighth as active as cefazolin. the composition and ph of the culture medium had little effect on the activity of ly, although 7.2 appeared to be the optimum ph.
hr 756, a new cephalosporin active against gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.
the in vitro activity of hr 756, 7-[2-(2-amino-4-thiazolyl)-2-(z)-(methoximino)acetamido] cephalosporanic acid, was investigated against 659 isolates. hr 756 inhibited neisseria and haemophilus species at concentrations similar to those needed with ampicillin. it inhibited beta-lactamase-producing n. gonorrhoeae and h. influenzae. hr 756 was the most active compound tested against members of the enterobacteriaceae, inhibiting most isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, salmonella, enterobacter, and shigella at concentrations of less than 0.1 mug/ml. it was twice as active as carbenicillin against pseudomonas aeruginosa and inhibited bacteroides fragilis as well as cefoxitin. hr 756 killed e. coli, staphylococcus aureus, and p. aeruginosa at rates similar to other beta-lactam antibiotics.
comparison of the in vitro activity of bay k 4999 and piperacillin, two new antipseudomonal broad-spectrum penicillins, with other beta-lactam drugs.
bay k 4999 and piperacillin, two new substituted ampicillins, were compared with  other beta-lactam antibiotics, including carbenicillin, azlocillin, mezlocillin, benzylpenicillin, ampicillin, and cefoxitin, against a wide range of gram-positive and -negative organisms. bay k 4999 and piperacillin were extremely active against pseudomonas aeruginosa (50% inhibited by 2 mug/ml), being about 16-fold more active than carbenicillin. bay k 4999 was the most active drug against escherichia coli (50% inhibited by 0.5 mug/ml) and klebsiella spp. (50% inhibited by 2 mug/ml). piperacillin and bay k 4999 were equally active against proteus spp., and piperacillin had high activity against bacteroides fragilis (50% inhibited by between 1 and 2 mug/ml).
in vitro studies of piperacilin, a new semisynthetic penicillin.
piperacillin, a new semisynthetic penicillin, was compared with other semisynthetic penicillins, cephalosporins, and aminoglycosides by the agar dilution method against 3,600 isolates of facultative gram-negative bacilli, bacteroides fragilis, and enterococci. at 64 mug/ml, piperacillin inhibited 90% of the isolates in each group of organisms tested except for escherichia coli (83% inhibited by 64 mug/ml). compared with carbenicillin, piperacillin had a 16-fold increase in activity by weight against pseudomonas aeruginosa and the enterococcus, an 8-fold increase against serratia marcescens, and a 4-fold increase against b. fragilis and enterobacter species. piperacillin was highly active against carbenicillin-resistant klebsiella pneumoniae and inhibited many aminoglycoside-resistant organisms. except for p. aeruginosa, the minimum bactericidal concentration of piperacillin was usually within one tube dilution of the minimum inhibitory concentration. approximately one-third of the gram-negative bacilli were inhibited synergistically by piperacillin plus amikacin, but no synergy could be demonstrated against enterococci. piperacillin's in vitro activity against gram-negative bacilli was similar to gentamicin's except that it also included b. fragilis, and piperacillin was decidedly superior to presently available penicillins against k. pneumoniae.
in vitro activity of gentamicin and minocycline alone and in combination against  bacteria associated with intra-abdominal sepsis.
the minimal inhibitory concentrations of gentamicin and minocycline alone and in  combination were determined by a broth microdilution method for 100 aerobic, facultative, and anaerobic isolates representative of pathogens recovered from patients with intra-abdominal sepsis. gentamicin inhibited all strains of klebsiella, enterobacter, and pseudomonas aeruginosa in concentrations of 0.4 to 3.1 mug/ml and all strains of escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis in concentrations of 0.8 to 12.5 mug/ml. whereas minocycline did not consistently inhibit these organisms in concentrations of 1.6 mug or less/ml, it did act synergistically with gentamicin against 43% of the enterobacteriaceae tested in clinically achievable concentrations; significant synergy was most common with e. coli (60%). minocycline inhibited 62% of bacteroides fragilis, 71% of clostridium, 40% of anaerobic cocci, and 40% of enterococci tested in concentrations of 1.6 mug or less/ml. whereas gentamicin rarely inhibited these organisms in concentrations of 6.2 mug or less/ml, it did act synergistically with minocycline against 20% of b. fragilis, 67% of clostridium, 22% of anaerobic cocci, and 22% of enterococci (which had minimal inhibitory concentrations of minocycline within the range tested) at clinically achievable concentrations. although only four (13%) of the 30 isolates resistant to both gentamicin and minocycline alone were inhibited by clinically achievable concentrations of the combination, the observed synergy, particularly against strains of e. coli, was considered to be of potential clinical usefulness. antagonism between gentamicin and minocycline was not observed at the concentrations tested.
effect of colon flora and short-chain fatty acids on growth in vitro of pseudomonas aeruginsoa and enterobacteriaceae.
heat-stable antibacterial activity in the following suspensions was demonstrated  against pseudomonas aeruginosa at ph 6.5, 6.0, and 5.5: (i) pooled colon contents of normal mice; (ii) an anaerobic, 48-h culture of normal mouse feces; and (iii) anaerobic, 48-h cultures of different bacteria from human colon flora (escherichia coli, bacteroides fragilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis). the lower the ph of the medium, the greater was the antibacterial activity of these suspensions. the antibacterial activity of five fatty acids (propionic, butyric, isobutyric, acetic, and formic acids) was greater against p. aeruginosa than against three enterobacteriaceae (e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and p. mirabilis) at all fatty acid concentrations (0.16 m to 0.005 m) and at the 3 ph values studied (5.5, 6.0, and 6.5). as the ph value increased, the antibacterial activity decreased. antibacterial activity was greater at higher fatty acid concentrations, and at each ph value it was greatest for the fatty acids having high pk(a) values. lactic acid, with the lowest pk(a), exhibited little or no antibacterial activity. acetic and butyric acids, two of the three predominant volatile fatty acids determined by gas chromatography in the mouse colon contents and in the anaerobic culture of mouse feces, occurred in vivo in concentrations which inhibited growth of p. aeruginosa in vitro at the ph of the mouse cecum. these results suggest that undissociated short-chain fatty acids produced by the colon flora may be a mechanism of intestinal resistance to colonization by p. aeruginosa.
