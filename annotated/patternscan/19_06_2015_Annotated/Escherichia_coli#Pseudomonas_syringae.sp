TI  == a set of robust fluorescent peptide probes for quantification of cu(ii) binding affinities in the micromolar to femtomolar range.
AB  == reliable quantification of copper binding affinities and identification of the binding sites provide a molecular basis for an understanding of the nutritional roles and toxic effects of copper ions. sets of chromophoric probes are now available that can quantify cu(i) binding affinities from nanomolar to attomolar  concentrations on a unified scale under in vitro conditions. equivalent probes for cu(ii) are lacking. this work reports development of a set of four fluorescent dansyl peptide probes (dp1-4) that can quantify cu(ii) binding affinities from micromolar to femtomolar concentrations, also on a unified scale. the probes were constructed by conjugation of a dansyl group to four short peptides of specific design. each was characterised by its dissociation constant  kd, its ph dependence and the nature of its binding site. one equivalent of cu(ii) is bound by the individual probes that display different and well-separated affinities at ph 7.4 (log kd = -8.1, -10.1, -12.3 and -14.1, respectively). intense fluorescence is emitted at lambdamax approximately 550 nm  upon excitation at approximately 330 nm. binding of cu(ii) quenches the fluorescence intensity linearly until one equivalent of cu(ii) is bound. multiple approaches and multiple affinity standards were employed to ensure reliability. selected examples of application to well-characterised cu(ii) binding peptides and proteins are presented. these include abeta16 peptides, two naturally occurring cu(ii)-chelating motifs in human serum and cerebrospinal fluid with sequences ghk and dahk and two copper binding proteins, copc from pseudomonas syringae and pcoc from escherichia coli. previously reported affinities are reproduced, demonstrating that peptides dp1-4 form a set of robust and reliable probes for cu(ii) binding to peptides and protein targets.

TI  == pebl1, a novel protein elicitor from brevibacillus laterosporus strain a60, activates defense responses and systemic resistance in nicotiana benthamiana.
AB  == we report the identification, characterization, and gene cloning of a novel protein elicitor (pebl1) secreted from brevibacillus laterosporus strain a60. through a purification process consisting of ion-exchange chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc), we isolated a protein that was identified by electrospray ionization quadrupole time of flight tandem mass spectrometry (esi-q-tof-ms-ms). the 351-bp pebl1 gene produces a 12,833-da protein with 116 amino acids that contains a 30-residue signal peptide. the pebl1 protein was expressed in escherichia coli. the recombinant protein can induce a typical hypersensitive response (hr) and systemic resistance in nicotiana benthamiana, like the endogenous protein. pebl1-treated n. benthamiana exhibited  strong resistance to the infection of tobacco mosaic virus-green fluorescent protein (tmv-gfp) and pseudomonas syringae pv. tabaci compared to control n. benthamiana. in addition, pebl1 triggered a cascade of events that resulted in defense responses in plants, including reactive oxygen species (ros) production,  extracellular-medium alkalization, phenolic-compound deposition, and expression of several defense-related genes. real-time quantitative-pcr analysis indicated that the known defense-related genes pr-1, pr-5, pdf1.2, npr1, and pal were upregulated to varying degrees by pebl1. this research not only provides insights into the mechanism by which beneficial bacteria activate plant systemic resistance, but also sheds new light on a novel strategy for biocontrol using strain a60.

TI  == constrictor: constraint modification provides insight into design of biochemical  networks.
AB  == advances in computational methods that allow for exploration of the combinatorial mutation space are needed to realize the potential of synthetic biology based strain engineering efforts. here, we present constrictor, a computational framework that uses flux balance analysis (fba) to analyze inhibitory effects of  genetic mutations on the performance of biochemical networks. constrictor identifies engineering interventions by classifying the reactions in the metabolic model depending on the extent to which their flux must be decreased to  achieve the overproduction target. the optimal inhibition of various reaction pathways is determined by restricting the flux through targeted reactions below the steady state levels of a baseline strain. constrictor generates unique in silico strains, each representing an "expression state", or a combination of gene expression levels required to achieve the overproduction target. the constrictor  framework is demonstrated by studying overproduction of ethylene in escherichia coli network models iaf1260 and ijo1366 through the addition of the heterologous  ethylene-forming enzyme from pseudomonas syringae. targeting individual reactions as well as combinations of reactions reveals in silico mutants that are predicted to have as high as 25% greater theoretical ethylene yields than the baseline strain during simulated exponential growth. altering the degree of restriction reveals a large distribution of ethylene yields, while analysis of the expression states that return lower yields provides insight into system bottlenecks. finally, we demonstrate the ability of constrictor to scan networks and provide targets for a range of possible products. constrictor is an adaptable technique that can be used to generate and analyze disparate populations of in silico mutants, select gene expression levels and provide non-intuitive strategies for metabolic engineering.

TI  == pepper pathogenesis-related protein 4c is a plasma membrane-localized cysteine protease inhibitor that is required for plant cell death and defense signaling.
AB  == xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria (xcv) type iii effector avrbst triggers programmed cell death (pcd) and activates the hypersensitive response (hr) in plants. here, we isolated and identified the plasma membrane localized pathogenesis-related (pr) protein 4c gene (capr4c) from pepper (capsicum annuum)  leaves undergoing avrbst-triggered hr cell death. capr4c encodes a protein with a signal peptide and a barwin domain. recombinant capr4c protein expressed in escherichia coli exhibited cysteine protease-inhibitor activity and ribonuclease  (rnase) activity. subcellular localization analyses revealed that capr4c localized to the plasma membrane in plant cells. capr4c expression was rapidly and specifically induced by avirulent xcv (avrbst) infection. transient expression of capr4c caused hr cell death in pepper leaves, which was accompanied by enhanced accumulation of h2 o2 and significant induction of some defense-response genes. deletion of the signal peptide from capr4c abolished the  induction of hr cell death, indicating a requirement for plasma membrane localization of capr4c for hr cell death. capr4c silencing in pepper disrupted both basal and avrbst-triggered resistance responses, and enabled xcv proliferation in infected leaves. h2 o2 accumulation, cell-death induction, and defense-response gene expression were distinctly reduced in capr4c-silenced pepper. capr4c overexpression in transgenic arabidopsis plants conferred greater  resistance against infection by pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato and hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis. these results collectively suggest that capr4c plays an important role in plant cell death and defense signaling.

TI  == trna modification enzymes gida and mnme: potential role in virulence of bacterial pathogens.
AB  == transfer rna (trna) is an rna molecule that carries amino acids to the ribosomes  for protein synthesis. these trnas function at the peptidyl (p) and aminoacyl (a) binding sites of the ribosome during translation, with each codon being recognized by a specific trna. due to this specificity, trna modification is essential for translational efficiency. many enzymes have been implicated in the  modification of bacterial trnas, and these enzymes may complex with one another or interact individually with the trna. approximately, 100 trna modification enzymes have been identified with glucose-inhibited division (gida) protein and mnme being two of the enzymes studied. in escherichia coli and salmonella, gida and mnme bind together to form a functional complex responsible for the proper biosynthesis of 5-methylaminomethyl-2-thiouridine (mnm(5)s(2)u34) of trnas. studies have implicated this pathway in a major pathogenic regulatory mechanism as deletion of gida and/or mnme has attenuated several bacterial pathogens like salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, pseudomonas syringae, aeromonas hydrophila, and many others. in this review, we summarize the potential role of the gida/mnme trna modification pathway in bacterial virulence, interactions with the host, and potential therapeutic strategies resulting from a greater understanding of this regulatory mechanism.

TI  == construction of a dual fluorescence whole-cell biosensor to detect n-acyl homoserine lactones.
AB  == detection of n-acyl homoserine lactones (ahls) is useful for understanding quorum sensing (qs) behaviors, including biofilm formation, virulence and metabolism. for detecting ahls and indicating the host cells in situ, we constructed the plasmid pucgma2t(1-4) to make a dual fluorescent whole-cell biosensor based on the ahlir ahl system of pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae b728a. the plasmid contains three components: constitutively expressed p(npatii::gfp) for indicating host cells, p(ahli::mcherry) that produces red fluorescence in response to ahl, and the ahlr gene that encodes an ahl regulatory protein. meanwhile, two copies of t(1-4) (four tandem copies of a transcriptional terminator) were added into the plasmid to reduce background. the results showed that when the plasmid was placed into escherichia coli, the dual fluorescence whole-cell biosensor was able to respond with red fluorescence within 6 hr to 5 x 10(-8)-1 x 10(-5) mol/l of 3oc6-hsl. bright green fluorescence indicated the host cells. furthermore, when the plasmid was transferred to wildtype pseudomonas phta125 (an ahl-producing bacterium), it also showed both green and red fluorescence. this result demonstrates that this plasmid can be used to construct whole-cell indicators that can indicate the ahl response and spatial behaviors of microbes in a microenvironmental niche.

TI  == engineering modular and tunable genetic amplifiers for scaling transcriptional signals in cascaded gene networks.
AB  == synthetic biology aims to control and reprogram signal processing pathways within living cells so as to realize repurposed, beneficial applications. here we report the design and construction of a set of modular and gain-tunable genetic amplifiers in escherichia coli capable of amplifying a transcriptional signal with wide tunable-gain control in cascaded gene networks. the devices are engineered using orthogonal genetic components (hrprs, hrpv and phrpl) from the hrp (hypersensitive response and pathogenicity) gene regulatory network in pseudomonas syringae. the amplifiers can linearly scale up to 21-fold the transcriptional input with a large output dynamic range, yet not introducing significant time delay or significant noise during signal amplification. the set  of genetic amplifiers achieves different gains and input dynamic ranges by varying the expression levels of the underlying ligand-free activator proteins in the device. as their electronic counterparts, these engineered transcriptional amplifiers can act as fundamental building blocks in the design of biological systems by predictably and dynamically modulating transcriptional signal flows to implement advanced intra- and extra-cellular control functions.

TI  == psasm2i, a type ii restriction-modification system in pseudomonas savastanoi pv.  savastanoi: differential distribution of carrier strains in the environment and the evolutionary history of homologous rm systems in the pseudomonas syringae complex.
AB  == a type ii restriction-modification system was found in a native plasmid of pseudomonas savastanoi pv. savastanoi mlli2. functional analysis of the methyltransferase showed that the enzyme acts by protecting the dna sequence ctgcag from cleavage. restriction endonuclease expression in recombinant escherichia coli cells resulted in mutations in the rease sequence or transposition of insertion sequence 1a in the coding sequence, preventing lethal  gene expression. population screening detected homologous rm systems in other p.  savastanoi strains and in the pseudomonas syringae complex. an epidemiological survey carried out by sampling olive and oleander knots in two italian regions showed an uneven diffusion of carrier strains, whose presence could be related to a selective advantage in maintaining the rm system in particular environments or  subpopulations. moreover, carrier strains can coexist in the same orchards, plants, and knot tissues with non-carriers, revealing unexpected genetic variability on a very small spatial scale. phylogenetic analysis of the rm system and housekeeping gene sequences in the p. syringae complex demonstrated the ancient acquisition of the rm systems. however, the evolutionary history of the gene complex also showed the involvement of horizontal gene transfer between related strains and recombination events.

TI  == expression and localization of an ice nucleating protein from a soil bacterium, pseudomonas borealis.
AB  == an ice nucleating protein (inp) coding region with 66% sequence identity to the inp of pseudomonas syringae was previously cloned from p. borealis, a plant beneficial soil bacterium. ice nucleating activity (ina) in the p. borealis dl7 strain was highest after transfer of cultures to temperatures just above freezing. the corresponding inp coding sequence (inapb or ina) was used to construct recombinant plasmids, with recombinant expression visualized using a green fluorescent protein marker (gfp encoding gfp). although the p. borealis strain was originally isolated by ice-affinity, bacterial cultures with membrane-associated inp-gfp did not adsorb to pre-formed ice. employment of a shuttle vector allowed expression of ina-gfp in both escherichia coli and pseudomonas cells. at 27 degrees c, diffuse fluorescence appeared throughout the  cells and was associated with low ina. however, after transfer of cultures to 4 degrees c, the protein localized to the poles coincident with high ina. transformants with truncated inp sequences ligated to either gfp, or an antifreeze protein-gfp fusion showed that the repetitive ice-nucleation domain was not necessary for localization. such localization is consistent with the flanking residues of the inp associating with a temperature-dependent secretion apparatus. a polar location would facilitate inp-inp interactions resulting in the formation of larger aggregates, serving to increase ina. expression of inps by p. borealis could function as an efficient atmospheric dispersal mechanism for these soil bacteria, which are less likely to use these proteins for nutrient procurement, as has been suggested for p. syringae.

TI  == combining de ley-doudoroff and methylerythritol phosphate pathways for enhanced isoprene biosynthesis from d-galactose.
AB  == an engineered escherichia coli strain was developed for enhanced isoprene production using d-galactose as substrate. isoprene is a valuable compound that can be biosynthetically produced from pyruvate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (g3p) through the methylerythritol phosphate pathway (mep). the leloir and de ley-doudoroff (dd) pathways are known existing routes in e. coli that can supply  the mep precursors from d-galactose. the dd pathway was selected as it is capable of supplying equimolar amounts of pyruvate and g3p simultaneously. to exclusively direct d-galactose toward the dd pathway, an e. coli deltagalk strain with blocked leloir pathway was used as the host. to obtain a fully functional dd pathway, a dehydrogenase encoding gene (gld) was recruited from pseudomonas syringae to catalyze d-galactose conversion to d-galactonate. overexpressions of  endogenous genes known as mep bottlenecks, and a heterologous gene, were conducted to enhance and enable isoprene production, respectively. growth test confirmed a functional dd pathway concomitant with equimolar generation of pyruvate and g3p, in contrast to the wild-type strain where g3p was limiting. finally, the engineered strain with combined dd-mep pathway exhibited the highest isoprene production. this suggests that the equimolar pyruvate and g3p pools resulted in a more efficient carbon flux toward isoprene production. this strategy provides a new platform for developing improved isoprenoid producing strains through the combined dd-mep pathway.

TI  == antibacterial activities of ligaria cuneifolia and jodina rhombifolia leaf extracts against phytopathogenic and clinical bacteria.
AB  == six plant extracts prepared from ligaria cuneifolia and jodina rhombifolia were screened for their potential antimicrobial activities against phytopathogens and  clinically standard reference bacterial strains. bioautography and broth microdilution methods were used to study samples antibacterial activities against 7 bacterial strains. the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) of samples were attained. an antibacterial activity guided isolation and identification of active compounds was carried out  for l. cuneifolia methanolic extract (lcme). both methanolic and aqueous extracts from l. cuneifolia showed inhibitory activities against phytopathogenic bacteria, with mics ranging from 2.5 to 156 mug ml(-1) for lcme and 5 mg ml(-1) for the aqueous extract. none of the three j. rhombifolia extracts showed significant antibacterial activities against phytopathogenic strains (mic > 5 mg ml(-1)), except for the aqueous extracts against pseudomonas syringae (mic = 312 mug ml(-1)). only lcme showed bactericidal activities against phytopathogenic strains (mbcs = 78 mug ml(-1)). the lcme exhibited significant inhibitory activity against reference clinical strains: escherichia coli (mic = 156 mug ml(-1)) and staphylococcus aureus (mic = 78 mug ml(-1), mbc = 312 mug ml(-1)). lcme active compounds were identified as flavonol mono and diglycosides, and gallic acid. the antibacterial activity of purified compounds was also evaluated. a synergistic effect against s. aureus was found between gallic acid and a quercetin glycoside. hence, anti-phytopathogenic bacteria potential compounds isolated from l. cuneifolia could be used as an effective source against bacterial diseases in plants.

TI  == chp8, a diguanylate cyclase from pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato dc3000, suppresses the pathogen-associated molecular pattern flagellin, increases extracellular polysaccharides, and promotes plant immune evasion.
AB  == the bacterial plant pathogen pseudomonas syringae causes disease in a wide range  of plants. the associated decrease in crop yields results in economic losses and  threatens global food security. competition exists between the plant immune system and the pathogen, the basic principles of which can be applied to animal infection pathways. p. syringae uses a type iii secretion system (t3ss) to deliver virulence factors into the plant that promote survival of the bacterium.  the p. syringae t3ss is a product of the hypersensitive response and pathogenicity (hrp) and hypersensitive response and conserved (hrc) gene cluster, which is strictly controlled by the codependent enhancer-binding proteins hrpr and hrps. through a combination of bacterial gene regulation and phenotypic studies, plant infection assays, and plant hormone quantifications, we now report that chp8 (i) is embedded in the hrp regulon and expressed in response to plant signals and hrprs, (ii) is a functional diguanylate cyclase, (iii) decreases the  expression of the major pathogen-associated molecular pattern (pamp) flagellin and increases extracellular polysaccharides (eps), and (iv) impacts the salicylic acid/jasmonic acid hormonal immune response and disease progression. we propose that chp8 expression dampens pamp-triggered immunity during early plant infection. importance: the global demand for food is projected to rise by 50% by  2030 and, as such, represents one of the major challenges of the 21st century, requiring improved crop management. diseases caused by plant pathogens decrease crop yields, result in significant economic losses, and threaten global food security. gaining mechanistic insights into the events at the plant-pathogen interface and employing this knowledge to make crops more resilient is one important strategy for improving crop management. plant-pathogen interactions are characterized by the sophisticated interplay between plant immunity elicited upon pathogen recognition and immune evasion by the pathogen. here, we identify chp8 as a contributor to the major effort of the plant pathogen pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato dc3000 to evade immune responses of the plant.

TI  == pseudomonas syringae cc1557: a highly virulent strain with an unusually small type iii effector repertoire that includes a novel effector.
AB  == both type iii effector proteins and nonribosomal peptide toxins play important roles for pseudomonas syringae pathogenicity in host plants, but whether and how  these pathways interact to promote infection remains unclear. genomic evidence from one clade of p. syringae suggests a tradeoff between the total number of type iii effector proteins and presence of syringomycin, syringopeptin, and syringolin a toxins. here, we report the complete genome sequence from p. syringae cc1557, which contains the lowest number of known type iii effectors to  date and has also acquired genes similar to sequences encoding syringomycin pathways from other strains. we demonstrate that this strain is pathogenic on nicotiana benthamiana and that both the type iii secretion system and a new type  iii effector, hopbj1, contribute to pathogenicity. we further demonstrate that activity of hopbj1 is dependent on residues structurally similar to the catalytic site of escherichia coli cnf1 toxin. taken together, our results provide additional support for a negative correlation between type iii effector repertoires and the potential to produce syringomycin-like toxins while also highlighting how genomic synteny and bioinformatics can be used to identify and characterize novel virulence proteins.

TI  == involvement of rpph in thermoregulation in pseudomonas syringae.
AB  == temperature, among other environmental factors, influences the incidence and severity of many plant diseases. likewise, numerous traits, including the expression of virulence factors, are regulated by temperature. little is known about the underlying genetic determinants of thermoregulation in plant-pathogenic bacteria. previously, we showed that the expression of both flic (encoding flagellin) and syfa (encoding a nonribosomal polypeptide synthetase) was suppressed at high temperatures in pseudomonas syringae. in this work, we used a  high-throughput screen to identify mutations that conferred overexpression of syfa at elevated temperatures (28 degrees c compared to 20 degrees c). two genes, psyr_2474, encoding an acyl-coenzyme a (coa) dehydrogenase, and psyr_4843, encoding an ortholog of rpph, which in escherichia coli mediates rna turnover, contribute to thermoregulation of syfa. to assess the global role of rpph in thermoregulation in p. syringae, rna sequencing was used to compare the transcriptomes of an rpph deletion mutant and the wild-type strain incubated at 20 degrees c and 30 degrees c. the disruption of rpph had a large effect on the temperature-dependent transcriptome of p. syringae, affecting the expression of 569 genes at either 20 degrees c or 30 degrees c but not at both temperatures. intriguingly, rpph is involved in the thermoregulation of ribosome-associated proteins, as well as of rnase e, suggesting a prominent role of rpph on the proteome in addition to its effect on the transcriptome.

TI  == automated reconstruction of whole-genome phylogenies from short-sequence reads.
AB  == studies of microbial evolutionary dynamics are being transformed by the availability of affordable high-throughput sequencing technologies, which allow whole-genome sequencing of hundreds of related taxa in a single study. reconstructing a phylogenetic tree of these taxa is generally a crucial step in any evolutionary analysis. instead of constructing genome assemblies for all taxa, annotating these assemblies, and aligning orthologous genes, many recent studies 1) directly map raw sequencing reads to a single reference sequence, 2) extract single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps), and 3) infer the phylogenetic tree using maximum likelihood methods from the aligned snp positions. however, here we show that, when using such methods to reconstruct phylogenies from sets of simulated sequences, both the exclusion of nonpolymorphic positions and the alignment to a single reference genome, introduce systematic biases and errors in phylogeny reconstruction. to address these problems, we developed a new method that combines alignments from mappings to multiple reference sequences and show that this successfully removes biases from the reconstructed phylogenies. we implemented this method as a web server named realphy (reference sequence alignment-based phylogeny builder), which fully automates phylogenetic reconstruction from raw sequencing reads.

TI  == effectors of animal and plant pathogens use a common domain to bind host phosphoinositides.
AB  == bacterial type iii secretion systems deliver effectors into host cells to manipulate cellular processes to the advantage of the pathogen. many host targets of these effectors are found on membranes. therefore, to identify their targets,  effectors often use specialized membrane-localization domains to localize to appropriate host membranes. however, the molecular mechanisms used by many domains are unknown. here we identify a conserved bacterial phosphoinositide-binding domain (bpd) that is found in functionally diverse type  iii effectors of both plant and animal pathogens. we show that members of the bpd family functionally bind phosphoinositides and mediate localization to host membranes. moreover, nmr studies reveal that the bpd of the newly identified vibrio parahaemolyticus type iii effector vopr is unfolded in solution, but folds into a specific structure upon binding its ligand phosphatidylinositol-(4,5)-bisphosphate. thus, our findings suggest a possible mechanism for promoting refolding of type iii effectors after delivery into host  cells.

TI  == enhanced synthesis of 5-hydroxy-l-tryptophan through tetrahydropterin regeneration.
AB  == 5-hydroxy-l-tryptophan (5-htp) is a naturally occurring aromatic amino acid present in the seeds of the african plant griffonia simplicifolia. although 5-htp has therapeutic effects in various symptoms, efficient method of producing 5-htp  has not been established. in this study, we developed a novel cofactor regeneration process to achieve enhanced synthesis of 5-htp by using modified l-phenylalanine 4-hydroxylase of chromobacterium violaceum. for the synthesis of  5-htp using escherichia coli whole cell bioconversion, l-tryptophan and 5-htp degradation by e. coli endogenous catabolic enzymes should be considered. the tryptophanase gene was disrupted using the lambda red recombination system, since tryptophanase is postulated as an initial enzyme for the degradation of l-tryptophan and 5-htp in e. coli. for regeneration of the cofactor pterin, we screened and investigated several key enzymes, including dihydropteridine reductase from e. coli, glucose dehydrogenase from bacillus subtilis, and pterin-4alpha-carbinolamine dehydratase from pseudomonas syringae. genes encoding these three enzymes were overexpressed in an e. coli tryptophanase-deficient host, resulting in the synthesis of 0.74 mm 5-htp in the presence of 0.1 mm pterin and the synthesis of 0.07 mm 5-htp in the absence of regeneration of pterin. these results clearly indicated the successful regeneration of pterin. following optimization of the reaction conditions, 2.5 mm 5-htp was synthesized with cofactor regeneration, while 0.8 mm 5-htp was recovered without cofactor regeneration under the same reaction conditions, suggesting that the principle described here provides a new method for cofactor regeneration.

TI  == uv light inactivation of human and plant pathogens in unfiltered surface irrigation water.
AB  == fruit and vegetable growers continually battle plant diseases and food safety concerns. surface water is commonly used in the production of fruits and vegetables and can harbor both human- and plant-pathogenic microorganisms that can contaminate crops when used for irrigation or other agricultural purposes. treatment methods for surface water are currently limited, and there is a need for suitable treatment options. a liquid-processing unit that uses uv light for the decontamination of turbid juices was analyzed for its efficacy in the treatment of surface waters contaminated with bacterial or oomycete pathogens, i.e., escherichia coli, salmonella enterica, listeria monocytogenes, clavibacter  michiganensis subsp. michiganensis, pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato, and phytophthora capsici. five-strain cocktails of each pathogen, containing approximately 10(8) or 10(9) cfu/liter for bacteria or 10(4) or 10(5) zoospores/liter for ph. capsici, were inoculated into aliquots of two turbid surface water irrigation sources and processed with the uv unit. pathogens were enumerated before and after treatment. in general, as the turbidity of the water  source increased, the effectiveness of the uv treatment decreased, but in all cases, 99.9% or higher inactivation was achieved. log reductions ranged from 10.0 to 6.1 and from 5.0 to 4.2 for bacterial pathogens and ph. capsici, respectively.

TI  == bacterial effector activates jasmonate signaling by directly targeting jaz transcriptional repressors.
AB  == gram-negative bacterial pathogens deliver a variety of virulence proteins through the type iii secretion system (t3ss) directly into the host cytoplasm. these type iii secreted effectors (t3ses) play an essential role in bacterial infection, mainly by targeting host immunity. however, the molecular basis of their functionalities remains largely enigmatic. here, we show that the pseudomonas syringae t3se hopz1a, a member of the widely distributed yopj effector family, directly interacts with jasmonate zim-domain (jaz) proteins through the conserved jas domain in plant hosts. jazs are transcription repressors of jasmonate (ja)-responsive genes and major components of the jasmonate receptor complex. upon interaction, jazs can be acetylated by hopz1a through a putative acetyltransferase activity. importantly, p. syringae producing the wild-type, but not a catalytic mutant of hopz1a, promotes the degradation of hopz1-interacting jazs and activates ja signaling during bacterial infection. furthermore, hopz1a could partially rescue the virulence defect of a p. syringae mutant that lacks the production of coronatine, a ja-mimicking phytotoxin produced by a few p. syringae strains. these results highlight a novel example by which a bacterial effector directly manipulates the core regulators of phytohormone signaling to facilitate infection. the targeting of jaz repressors by both coronatine toxin and hopz1 effector suggests that the ja receptor complex is potentially a major hub of host targets for bacterial pathogens.

AB  == the toll/interleukin-1 receptor (tir) domain is a protein-protein interaction domain that is found in both animal and plant immune receptors. the n-terminal tir domain from the nucleotide-binding (nb)-leucine-rich repeat (lrr) class of plant disease-resistance (r) proteins has been shown to play an important role in defence signalling. recently, the crystal structure of the tir domain from flax r protein l6 was determined and this structure, combined with functional studies, demonstrated that tir-domain homodimerization is a requirement for function of the r protein l6. to advance the molecular understanding of the function of tir domains in r-protein signalling, the protein expression, purification, crystallization and x-ray diffraction analyses of the tir domains of the arabidopsis thaliana r proteins rps4 (resistance to pseudomonas syringae 4) and rrs1 (resistance to ralstonia solanacearum 1) and the resistance-like protein snc1 (suppressor of npr1-1, constitutive 1) are reported here. rps4 and rrs1 function cooperatively as a dual resistance-protein system that prevents infection by three distinct pathogens. snc1 is implicated in resistance pathways  in arabidopsis and is believed to be involved in transcriptional regulation through its interaction with the transcriptional corepressor tpr1 (topless-related 1). the tir domains of all three proteins have successfully been expressed and purified as soluble proteins in escherichia coli. plate-like crystals of the rps4 tir domain were obtained using peg 3350 as a precipitant; they diffracted x-rays to 2.05 a resolution, had the symmetry of space group p1 and analysis of the matthews coefficient suggested that there were four molecules per asymmetric unit. tetragonal crystals of the rrs1 tir domain were obtained using ammonium sulfate as a precipitant; they diffracted x-rays to 1.75 a resolution, had the symmetry of space group p4(1)2(1)2 or p4(3)2(1)2 and were most likely to contain one molecule per asymmetric unit. crystals of the snc1 tir domain were obtained using peg 3350 as a precipitant; they diffracted x-rays to 2.20 a resolution and had the symmetry of space group p4(1)2(1)2 or p4(3)2(1)2, with two molecules predicted per asymmetric unit. these results provide a good foundation to advance the molecular and structural understanding of the function  of the tir domain in plant innate immunity.

TI  == [construction of cell surface display system in lactic acid bacteria by using ice nucleation protein].
AB  == objective: the gene of ice nucleation protein (inp), an outer membrane of pseudomonas syringae was tested to display foreign proteins on the surface of lactococcus lactis. methods: plasmids phz101 and phz102 were constructed using gfp (green fluorescence protein) as the reporter gene and n-terminal and nc-terminal of inp as the anchoring units. plasmids phz101 and phz102 were subsequently transformed into escherichia coli jm109 and lactococcus lactis mg1363. results: fluorescence microscope shows that green fluorescence was observed in both recombinant e. coli and l. lactis strains. western blot indicated that gfp was expressed in both recombinant e. coli and l. lactis strains. inpn-gfp was mostly trapped in cytoplastic fraction while inpnc-gfp was  mainly targeted on the cell membrane of l. lactis. conclusion: the results suggest a new way to construct cell surface display system of lactic acid bacteria by using ice nucleation protein.

TI  == structure of microcin b-like compounds produced by pseudomonas syringae and species specificity of their antibacterial action.
AB  == escherichia coli microcin b (ec-mcb) is a posttranslationally modified antibacterial peptide containing multiple oxazole and thiazole heterocycles and targeting the dna gyrase. we have found operons homologous to the ec-mcb biosynthesis-immunity operon mcb in recently sequenced genomes of several pathovars of the plant pathogen pseudomonas syringae, and we produced two variants of p. syringae microcin b (ps-mcb) in e. coli by heterologous expression. like ec-mcb, both versions of ps-mcb target the dna gyrase, but unlike ec-mcb, they are active against various species of the pseudomonas genus,  including human pathogen p. aeruginosa. through analysis of ec-mcb/ps-mcb chimeras, we demonstrate that three centrally located unmodified amino acids of ps-mcb are sufficient to determine activity against pseudomonas, likely by allowing specific recognition by a transport system that remains to be identified. the results open the way for construction of mcb-based antibacterial  molecules with extended spectra of biological activity.

TI  == metabolic engineering of escherichia coli for biosynthesis of d-galactonate.
AB  == d-galactose is an attractive substrate for bioconversion. herein, escherichia coli was metabolically engineered to convert d-galactose into d-galactonate, a valuable compound in the polymer and cosmetic industries. d-galactonate productions by engineered e. coli strains were observed in shake flask cultivations containing 2 g l(-1) d-galactose. engineered e. coli expressing gld  coding for galactose dehydrogenase from pseudomonas syringae was able to produce  0.17 g l(-1) d-galactonate. inherent metabolic pathways for assimilating both d-galactose and d-galactonate were blocked to enhance the production of d-galactonate. this approach finally led to a 7.3-fold increase with d-galactonate concentration of 1.24 g l(-1) and yield of 62.0 %. batch fermentation in 20 g l(-1) d-galactose of e. coli galkdgok mutant expressing the  gld resulted in 17.6 g l(-1) of d-galactonate accumulation and highest yield of 88.1 %. metabolic engineering strategy developed in this study could be useful for industrial production of d-galactonate.

TI  == l-amino acid ligase from pseudomonas syringae producing tabtoxin can be used for  enzymatic synthesis of various functional peptides.
AB  == functional peptides are expected to be beneficial compounds that improve our quality of life. to address the growing need for functional peptides, we have examined peptide synthesis by using microbial enzymes. l-amino acid ligase (lal)  catalyzes the condensation of unprotected amino acids in an atp-dependent manner  and is applicable to fermentative production. hence, lal is a promising enzyme to achieve cost-effective synthesis. to obtain a lal with novel substrate specificity, we focused on the putative lal involved in the biosynthesis of the dipeptidic phytotoxin designated tabtoxin. the tabs gene was cloned from pseudomonas syringae nbrc14081 and overexpressed in escherichia coli cells. the recombinant tabs protein produced showed the broadest substrate specificity of any known lal; it detected 136 of 231 combinations of amino acid substrates when  dipeptide synthesis was examined. in addition, some new substrate specificities were identified and unusual amino acids, e.g., l-pipecolic acid, hydroxy-l-proline, and beta-alanine, were found to be acceptable substrates. furthermore, kinetic analysis and monitoring of the reactions over a short time revealed that tabs showed distinct substrate selectivity at the n and c termini,  which made it possible to specifically synthesize a peptide without by-products such as homopeptides and heteropeptides with the reverse sequence. tabs specifically synthesized the following functional peptides, including their precursors: l-arginyl-l-phenylalanine (antihypertensive effect; yield, 62%), l-leucyl-l-isoleucine (antidepressive effect; yield, 77%), l-glutaminyl-l-tryptophan (precursor of l-glutamyl-l-tryptophan, which has antiangiogenic activity; yield, 54%), l-leucyl-l-serine (enhances saltiness; yield, 83%), and l-glutaminyl-l-threonine (precursor of l-glutamyl-l-threonine, which enhances saltiness; yield, 96%). furthermore, our results also provide new  insights into tabtoxin biosynthesis.

AB  == levansucrase encoded by the lsc-3 (lsc3) gene at genomic locus psptoa0032 of pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato dc3000 was mutationally analyzed. altogether, 18  single-amino-acid mutants of 13 positions of lsc3 were studied for catalytic properties, including production of fructooligosaccharides (fos). asp62, asp219,  and glu303 were proved as members of the catalytic triad. respective alanine replacement mutants were practically inactive with their kcat values reduced up to approximately 130,000 times. additionally, the requirements of trp61, gln301,  and arg304, located in conserved sequence blocks around the catalytic triad positions for the catalysis were shown. the catalytic significance of the position equivalent to arg304 was shown for levansucrases for the first time. replacement of gln301 specifically affected the polymerizing ability of lsc3. the gln301ala mutant was largely hydrolytic and produced 31 times less fos than the wild type. despite high conservation grades, leu66, pro220, asp225, and his306 tolerated replacement well. quantification of produced fos showed a high biotechnological potential of lsc3. using 1 mg of lsc3 protein, 15.4 g of fos with a degree of polymerization from 3 to 7 can be synthesized in a 20 h reaction with 1,200 mm sucrose. our expression system allowed us to produce up to 30 mg of lsc3 protein from 1 l of induced culture of recombinant escherichia coli.

TI  == evolutionary analysis and lateral gene transfer of two-component regulatory systems associated with heavy-metal tolerance in bacteria.
AB  == microorganisms have adapted intricate signal transduction mechanisms to coordinate tolerance to toxic levels of metals, including two-component regulatory systems (tcrs). in particular, both cop and czc operons are regulated  by tcrs; the cop operon plays a key role in bacterial tolerance to copper, whereas the czc operon is involved in the efflux of cadmium, zinc, and cobalt from the cell. although the molecular physiology of heavy metal tolerance genes has been extensively studied, their evolutionary relationships are not well-understood. phylogenetic relationships among heavy-metal efflux proteins and their corresponding two-component regulatory proteins revealed orthologous and paralogous relationships from species divergences and ancient gene duplications.  the presence of heavy metal tolerance genes on bacterial plasmids suggests these  genes may be prone to spread through horizontal gene transfer. phylogenetic inferences revealed nine potential examples of lateral gene transfer associated with metal efflux proteins and two examples for regulatory proteins. notably, four of the examples suggest lateral transfer across major evolutionary domains.  in most cases, differences in gc content in metal tolerance genes and their corresponding host genomes confirmed lateral gene transfer events. three-dimensional protein structures predicted for the response regulators encoded by cop and czc operons showed a high degree of structural similarity with other known proteins involved in tcrs signal transduction, which suggests common  evolutionary origins of functional phenotypes and similar mechanisms of action for these response regulators.

TI  == cloning and heterologous overexpression of three gap genes encoding different glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenases from the plant pathogenic bacterium pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato strain dc3000.
AB  == the gammaproteobacterium pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato dc3000 is the causal agent of bacterial speck, a common disease of tomato. the mode of infection of this pathogen is not well understood, but according to molecular biological, genomic and proteomic data it produces a number of proteins that may promote infection and draw nutrients from the plant. glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh) is a major enzyme of carbon metabolism that was reported to be a surface antigen and virulence factor in other pathogenic microorganisms, but its possible role in the infection process of p. syringae has so far not been studied. whole-genome sequence analyses revealed the occurrence in this phytopathogenic bacterium of three paralogous gap genes encoding distinct gapdhs, namely two class i enzymes having different molecular mass subunits and one class iii bifunctional d-erythrose-4-phosphate dehydrogenase/gapdh enzyme. by using genome bioinformatics data, as well as alignments of both dna and deduced protein sequences, the three gap genes of p. syringae were one-step cloned with a his-tag in pet21a vector using a pcr-based strategy, and its expression optimized in escherichia coli bl21 to achieve high yield of the heterologous proteins. in accordance with their distinct molecular phylogenies, these bacterial gap genes encode functional gapdhs of diverse molecular masses and nicotinamide-coenzyme specificities, suggesting specific metabolic and/or cellular roles.

TI  == secreted pitfall-trap fluid of carnivorous nepenthes plants is unsuitable for microbial growth.
AB  == background and aims: carnivorous plants of the genus nepenthes possess modified leaves that form pitfall traps in order to capture prey, mainly arthropods, to make additional nutrients available for the plant. these pitchers contain a digestive fluid due to the presence of hydrolytic enzymes. in this study, the composition of the digestive fluid was further analysed with regard to mineral nutrients and low molecular-weight compounds. a potential contribution of microbes to the composition of pitcher fluid was investigated. methods: fluids from closed pitchers were harvested and analysed for mineral nutrients using analytical techniques based on ion-chromatography and inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy. secondary metabolites were identified by a  combination of lc-ms and nmr. the presence of bacteria in the pitcher fluid was investigated by pcr of 16s-rrna genes. growth analyses of bacteria and yeast were performed in vitro with harvested pitcher fluid and in vivo within pitchers with  injected microbes. key results: the pitcher fluid from closed pitchers was found  to be primarily an approx. 25-mm kcl solution, which is free of bacteria and unsuitable for microbial growth probably due to the lack of essential mineral nutrients such as phosphate and inorganic nitrogen. the fluid also contained antimicrobial naphthoquinones, plumbagin and 7-methyl-juglone, and defensive proteins such as the thaumatin-like protein. challenging with bacteria or yeast caused bactericide as well as fungistatic properties in the fluid. our results reveal that nepenthes pitcher fluids represent a dynamic system that is able to react to the presence of microbes. conclusions: the secreted liquid of closed and freshly opened nepenthes pitchers is exclusively plant-derived. it is unsuitable  to serve as an environment for microbial growth. thus, nepenthes plants can avoid and control, at least to some extent, the microbial colonization of their pitfall traps and, thereby, reduce the need to vie with microbes for the prey-derived nutrients.

AB  == the ethylene-forming enzyme (efe) from pseudomonas syringae catalyzes the synthesis of ethylene which can be easily detected in the headspace of closed cultures. a synthetic codon-optimized gene encoding n-terminal his-tagged efe (efeh) was expressed in synechocystis sp. pcc 6803 (synechocystis) and escherichia coli (e. coli) under the control of diverse promoters in a self-replicating broad host-range plasmid. ethylene synthesis was stably maintained in both organisms in contrast to earlier work in synechococcus elongatus pcc 7942. the rate of ethylene accumulation was used as a reporter for  protein expression in order to assess promoter strength and inducibility with the different expression systems. several metal-inducible cyanobacterial promoters did not function in e. coli but were well-regulated in cyanobacteria, albeit at a low level of expression. the e. coli promoter p(trc) resulted in constitutive expression in cyanobacteria regardless of whether iptg was added or not. in contrast, a lac promoter variant, p(a1laco-1), induced efe-expression in synechocystis at a level of expression as high as the trc promoter and allowed a  fine level of iptg-dependent regulation of protein-expression. the regulation was tight at low cell density and became more relaxed in more dense cultures. a synthetic quorum-sensing promoter system was also constructed and shown to function well in e. coli, however, only a very low level of efe-activity was observed in synechocystis, independent of cell density.

TI  == expression and surface display of cellulomonas endoglucanase in the ethanologenic bacterium zymobacter palmae.
AB  == in order to reduce the cost of bioethanol production from lignocellulosic biomass, we developed a tool for cell surface display of cellulolytic enzymes on  the ethanologenic bacterium zymobacter palmae. z. palmae is a novel ethanol-fermenting bacterium capable of utilizing a broad range of sugar substrates, but not cellulose. therefore, to express and display heterologous cellulolytic enzymes on the z. palmae cell surface, we utilized the cell-surface  display motif of the pseudomonas ice nucleation protein ina. the gene encoding ina from pseudomonas syringae ifo3310 was cloned, and its product was comprised of three functional domains: an n-terminal domain, a central domain with repeated amino acid residues, and a c-terminal domain. the n-terminal domain of ina was shown to function as the anchoring motif for a green fluorescence protein fusion  protein in escherichia coli. to express a heterologous cellulolytic enzyme extracellularly in z. palmae, we fused the n-terminal coding sequence of ina to the coding sequence of an n-terminal-truncated cellulomonas endoglucanase. z. palmae cells carrying the fusion endoglucanase gene were shown to degrade carboxymethyl cellulose. although a portion of the expressed fusion endoglucanase was released from z. palmae cells into the culture broth, we confirmed the display of the protein on the cell surface by immunofluorescence microscopy. the  results indicate that the n-terminal anchoring motif of ina from p. syringae enabled the translocation and display of the heterologous cellulase on the cell surface of z. palmae.

AB  == microbial communities found on the surface of overwintering plants may be exposed to low temperatures as well as multiple freeze-thaw events. to explore the adaptive mechanisms of these epiphytes, with the objective of identifying products for freeze-protection, enrichment libraries were made from frost-exposed leaves. of 15 identified bacteria from 60 individual clones, approximately half had ice-association activities, with the great majority showing high freeze-thaw  resistance. isolates with ice nucleation activity and ice recrystallization inhibition activity were recovered. of the latter, two (erwinia billingiae j10, and sphingobacterium kitahiroshimense y2) showed culture and electron microscopic evidence of motility and/or biofilm production. mass spectrometric characterization of the e. billingiae extracellular polymeric substance (eps) identified the major proteins as 35 kda outer membrane protein a and f, supporting its biofilm character. the addition of the eps preparation increased the freeze-thaw survival of the more susceptible bacteria 1000-10000 times, and protection was at least partially dependent on the protein component.

TI  == molecular characterization of an ice nucleation protein variant (inaq) from pseudomonas syringae and the analysis of its transmembrane transport activity in  escherichia coli.
AB  == the ice nucleation protein (inp) of pseudomonas syringae has gained scientific interest not only because of its pathogenicity of foliar necroses but also for its wide range of potential applications, such as in snow making, frozen food preparation, and surface-display system development. however, studies on the transport activity of inp remain lacking. in the present study, a newly identified inp-gene variant, inaq, from a p. syringae mb03 strain was cloned. its structural domains, signal sequences, and the hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity of each domain, were then characterized. the deduced amino acid sequence of inaq shares similar protein domains with three p. syringae inps, namely, inak, inaz, and inav, which were identified as an n-terminal domain, a central repeating domain, and a c-terminal domain. the expression of the full-length inaq and of various truncated variants was induced in escherichia coli to analyze their transmembrane transport and surface-binding activities, while using the green fluorescence protein (gfp) as the fusion partner. with two transmembrane segments and a weak secretion signal, the n-terminal domain (inaq-n) alone was found to be responsible for the transport process as well as for the binding to the outer membrane, whereas the c-terminal region was nonfunctional in protein transport. increased membrane transport and surface-binding capacities were induced by a low isopropyl-beta-d-thiogalactoside concentration (0.1 mmol/l) but not by culture temperatures (15 masculinec to 37 masculinec). furthermore, by constructing the gfp-fused proteins with a single inaq-n, as well as two and three tandemly aligned inaq-n molecules, the transport and membrane-binding activities of these  proteins were compared using western blot analysis, immmunofluorescence microscopy, and assays of the gfp specific fluorescence intensity of subcellular  fractions and flow cytometry, which showed that the increase of inaq-n repeats resulted in a coordinated increase of the surface-immobilization efficiency. therefore, the results of this study can serve as a molecular basis for improving the performance of inp-based cell surface-display systems.

AB  == the reconstruction of a natural product biosynthetic pathway from bacteria in a vector and subsequent heterologous expression in a technically amenable microbial system represents an efficient alternative to empirical traditional methods for functional discovery, yield improvement, and genetic engineering to produce "unnatural" derivatives. however, the traditional cloning procedure based on genomic library construction and screening are complicated due to the large size  (>10 kb) of most biosynthetic pathways. here, we describe the direct cloning of a partial syringolin biosynthetic gene cluster (sylcde, 19 kb) from a digested genomic dna mixture of pseudomonas syringae into a plasmid in which sylcde is under the control of an inducible promoter by one step linear-plus-linear homologous recombination (llhr) in escherichia coli. after expression in e. coli  gb05-mtaa, two new syringolin derivatives were discovered. the complete syringolin gene cluster was assembled by addition of sylab and exchange of a synthetic bidirectional promoter against the native promoter to drive sylb and sylc expression by using red/et recombineering. the varying production distribution of syringolin derivatives showed the different efficiencies of native and synthetic promoters in e. coli. the successful reconstitution and expression of the syringolin biosynthetic pathway shows that red/et recombineering is an efficient tool to clone and engineer secondary metabolite biosynthetic pathways.

TI  == an image classification approach to analyze the suppression of plant immunity by  the human pathogen salmonella typhimurium.
AB  == background: the enteric pathogen salmonella is the causative agent of the majority of food-borne bacterial poisonings. resent research revealed that colonization of plants by salmonella is an active infection process. salmonella changes the metabolism and adjust the plant host by suppressing the defense mechanisms. in this report we developed an automatic algorithm to quantify the symptoms caused by salmonella infection on arabidopsis. results: the algorithm is designed to attribute image pixels into one of the two classes: healthy and unhealthy. the task is solved in three steps. first, we perform segmentation to divide the image into foreground and background. in the second step, a support vector machine (svm) is applied to predict the class of each pixel belonging to the foreground. and finally, we do refinement by a neighborhood-check in order to omit all falsely classified pixels from the second step. the developed algorithm  was tested on infection with the non-pathogenic e. coli and the plant pathogen pseudomonas syringae and used to study the interaction between plants and salmonella wild type and t3ss mutants. we proved that t3ss mutants of salmonella  are unable to suppress the plant defenses. results obtained through the automatic analyses were further verified on biochemical and transcriptome levels. conclusion: this report presents an automatic pixel-based classification method for detecting "unhealthy" regions in leaf images. the proposed method was compared to existing method and showed a higher accuracy. we used this algorithm  to study the impact of the human pathogenic bacterium salmonella typhimurium on plants immune system. the comparison between wild type bacteria and t3ss mutants  showed similarity in the infection process in animals and in plants. plant epidemiology is only one possible application of the proposed algorithm, it can be easily extended to other detection tasks, which also rely on color information, or even extended to other features.

TI  == grass: a generic algorithm for scaffolding next-generation sequencing assemblies.
AB  == motivation: the increasing availability of second-generation high-throughput sequencing (hts) technologies has sparked a growing interest in de novo genome sequencing. this in turn has fueled the need for reliable means of obtaining high-quality draft genomes from short-read sequencing data. the millions of reads usually involved in hts experiments are first assembled into longer fragments called contigs, which are then scaffolded, i.e. ordered and oriented using additional information, to produce even longer sequences called scaffolds. most existing scaffolders of hts genome assemblies are not suited for using information other than paired reads to perform scaffolding. they use this limited information to construct scaffolds, often preferring scaffold length over accuracy, when faced with the tradeoff. results: we present grass (generic assembly scaffolder)-a novel algorithm for scaffolding second-generation sequencing assemblies capable of using diverse information sources. grass offers  a mixed-integer programming formulation of the contig scaffolding problem, which  combines contig order, distance and orientation in a single optimization objective. the resulting optimization problem is solved using an expectation-maximization procedure and an unconstrained binary quadratic programming approximation of the original problem. we compared grass with existing hts scaffolders using illumina paired reads of three bacterial genomes.  our algorithm constructs a comparable number of scaffolds, but makes fewer errors. this result is further improved when additional data, in the form of related genome sequences, are used. availability: grass source code is freely available from http://code.google.com/p/tud-scaffolding/. supplementary information: supplementary data are available at bioinformatics online.

TI  == the pseef efflux system is a virulence factor of pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae.
AB  == an atp-binding cassette (abc) transporter, called the pseef efflux system, was identified at the left border of the syr-syp genomic island of pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae strain b301d. the pseef efflux system was located within a  3.3-kb operon that encodes a periplasmic membrane fusion protein (psee), and an abc-type cytoplasmic membrane protein (psef). the pseef efflux system exhibited amino acid homology to a putative abc efflux system (macab) of e. coli w3104 with identities of 47.2% (i.e., psee to maca) and 57.6% (i.e., psef to macb). a nonpolar mutation within the psef gene was generated by nptii insertional mutagenesis. the resultant mutant strain showed significant reduction in secretion of syringomycin (74%) and syringopeptin (71%), as compared to parental  strain b301d. quantitative real-time rt-pcr was used to determine transcript levels of the syringomycin (syrb1) and syringopeptin (sypa) synthetase genes in strain b301d-hk7 (a psef mutant). expression of the sypa gene by mutant strain b301d-hk7 was approximately 6.9% as compared to that of parental strain b301d, while the syrb1 gene expression by mutant strain b301d-hk7 was nearly 14.6%. in addition, mutant strain b301d-hk7 was less virulent by approximately 67% than parental strain b301d in immature cherry fruits. mutant strain b301d-hk7 was not  reduced in resistance to any antibiotics used in this study as compared to parental strain b301d. expression (transcript levels) of the psef gene was induced approximately six times by strain b301d grown on syringomycin minimum medium (srm) supplemented with the plant signal molecules arbutin and d-fructose  (srmaf), as compared to that of strain b301d grown on srm (in the absence of plant signal molecules). in addition, during infection of bean plants by p. syringae pv. syringae strain b728a, expression of the psef gene increased at 3 days after inoculation (dai). more than 180-fold induction was observed in transcript levels of the psef gene by parental strain b728a as compared to strain b728a-sl7 (a sala mutant). thus, the pseef efflux system, an abc-type efflux system, has an important role in secretion of syringomycin and syringopeptin, and is required for full virulence in p. syringae pv. syringae.

TI  == inducible nad overproduction in arabidopsis alters metabolic pools and gene expression correlated with increased salicylate content and resistance to pst-avrrpm1.
AB  == plant development and function are underpinned by redox reactions that depend on  co-factors such as nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (nad). nad has recently been shown to be involved in several signalling pathways that are associated with stress tolerance or defence responses. however, the mechanisms by which nad influences plant gene regulation, metabolism and physiology still remain unclear. here, we took advantage of arabidopsis thaliana lines that overexpressed the nadc gene from e. coli, which encodes the nad biosynthesis enzyme quinolinate phosphoribosyltransferase (qpt). upon incubation with quinolinate, these lines accumulated nad and were thus used as inducible systems to determine the consequences of an increased nad content in leaves. metabolic profiling showed clear changes in several metabolites such as aspartate-derived amino acids and nad-derived nicotinic acid. large-scale transcriptomic analyses indicated that nad promoted the induction of various pathogen-related genes such as the salicylic acid (sa)-responsive defence marker pr1. extensive comparison with transcriptomic databases further showed that gene expression under high nad content was similar to that obtained under biotic stress, eliciting conditions or sa treatment. upon inoculation with the avirulent strain of pseudomonas syringae  pv. tomato pst-avrrpm1, the nadc lines showed enhanced resistance to bacteria infection and exhibited an ics1-dependent build-up of both conjugated and free sa pools. we therefore concluded that higher nad contents are beneficial for plant immunity by stimulating sa-dependent signalling and pathogen resistance.

AB  == cavitating jet technologies (dynajets(r)) were investigated as a means of disinfection of gram-negative escherichia coli, klebsiellapneumoniae, pseudomonas syringae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, and gram-positive bacillus subtilis. the hydrodynamic cavitating jets were found to be very effective in reducing the concentrations of all of these species. in general, the observed rates of disinfection of gram-negative species were higher than for gram-positive species. however, different gram-negative species also showed significant differences (p.  syringae 6-log(10) reduction, p. aeruginosa 2-log(10) reduction) under the same conditions. disinfection of e. coli repeatedly showed five orders of magnitude reduction in concentration within 45-60-min at low nozzle pressure (2.1 bar). optimization of nozzle design and operating pressures increased disinfection rates per input energy by several orders of magnitude. the power efficiencies of  the hydrodynamic cavitating jets were found to be 10-100 times greater than comparable ultrasonic systems.

TI  == engineering modular and orthogonal genetic logic gates for robust digital-like synthetic biology.
AB  == modular and orthogonal genetic logic gates are essential for building robust biologically based digital devices to customize cell signalling in synthetic biology. here we constructed an orthogonal and gate in escherichia coli using a novel hetero-regulation module from pseudomonas syringae. the device comprises two co-activating genes hrpr and hrps controlled by separate promoter inputs, and a sigma(54)-dependent hrpl promoter driving the output. the hrpl promoter is activated only when both genes are expressed, generating digital-like and integration behaviour. the and gate is demonstrated to be modular by applying new regulated promoters to the inputs, and connecting the output to a not gate module to produce a combinatorial nand gate. the circuits were assembled using a parts-based engineering approach of quantitative characterization, modelling, followed by construction and testing. the results show that new genetic logic devices can be engineered predictably from novel native orthogonal biological control elements using quantitatively in-context characterized parts.

TI  == fast scaffolding with small independent mixed integer programs.
AB  == motivation: assembling genomes from short read data has become increasingly popular, but the problem remains computationally challenging especially for larger genomes. we study the scaffolding phase of sequence assembly where preassembled contigs are ordered based on mate pair data. results: we present mip scaffolder that divides the scaffolding problem into smaller subproblems and solves these with mixed integer programming. the scaffolding problem can be represented as a graph and the biconnected components of this graph can be solved independently. we present a technique for restricting the size of these subproblems so that they can be solved accurately with mixed integer programming. we compare mip scaffolder to two state of the art methods, sopra and sspace. mip  scaffolder is fast and produces better or as good scaffolds as its competitors on large genomes. availability: the source code of mip scaffolder is freely available at http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/lmsalmel/mip-scaffolder/. contact: leena.salmela@cs.helsinki.fi.

TI  == rnr gene from the antarctic bacterium pseudomonas syringae lz4w, encoding a psychrophilic rnase r.
AB  == rnase r is a highly processive, hydrolytic 3'-5' exoribonuclease belonging to the rnb/rnr superfamily which plays significant roles in rna metabolism in bacteria.  the enzyme was observed to be essential for growth of the psychrophilic antarctic bacterium pseudomonas syringae lz4w at a low temperature. we present results here pertaining to the biochemical properties of rnase r and the rnase r-encoding gene (rnr) locus from this bacterium. by cloning and expressing a his(6)-tagged form of the p. syringae rnase r (rnase r(ps)), we show that the enzyme is active at 0  to 4 degrees c but exhibits optimum activity at approximately 25 degrees c. the enzyme is heat labile in nature, losing activity upon incubation at 37 degrees c  and above, a hallmark of many psychrophilic enzymes. the enzyme requires divalent cations (mg(2)(+) and mn(2)(+)) for activity, and the activity is higher in 50 to 150 mm kcl when it largely remains as a monomer. on synthetic substrates, rnase r(ps) exhibited maximum activity on poly(a) and poly(u) in preference over poly(g) and poly(c). the enzyme also degraded structured male-malf rna substrates. analysis of the cleavage products shows that the enzyme, apart from releasing 5'-nucleotide monophosphates by the processive exoribonuclease activity, produces four-nucleotide end products, as opposed to two-nucleotide products, of rna chain by escherichia coli rnase r. interestingly, three ribonucleotides (atp, gtp, and ctp) inhibited the activity of rnase r(ps) in vitro. the ability of the nonhydrolyzable atp-gammas to inhibit rnase r(ps) activity suggests that nucleotide hydrolysis is not required for inhibition. this is the first report on the biochemical property of a psychrophilic rnase r from any bacterium.

TI  == robustness assessment of whole bacterial genome segmentations.
AB  == comparison of closely related bacterial genomes has revealed the presence of highly conserved sequences forming a "backbone" that is interrupted by numerous,  less conserved, dna fragments. segmentation of bacterial genomes into backbone and variable regions is particularly useful to investigate, among other things, bacterial genome evolution. several software tools have been designed to compare  complete bacterial chromosomes and a few online databases store pre-computed genome comparisons. however, very few statistical methods are available to evaluate the reliability of these software tools and to compare the results obtained with them. to fill this gap, we have developed two local scores to measure the robustness of bacterial genome segmentations. our method uses a simulation procedure based on random perturbations of the compared genomes. the two scores described in this article provide useful information and are easy to implement, and their interpretation is intuitive. we show that they are suited to discriminate between robust and non-robust segmentations when genome aligners such as mauve and mga are used.

TI  == cell surface display of carbonic anhydrase on escherichia coli using ice nucleation protein for co(2) sequestration.
AB  == carbonic anhydrase (ca) has recently gained renewed interests for its potential as a mass-transfer facilitator for co(2) sequestration. however, the low stability and high price severely limit its applications. in this work, the expression of alpha-ca from helicobacter pylori on the outer membrane of escherichia coli using a surface-anchoring system derived from ice nucleation protein (inp) from pseudomonas syringae was developed. to find the best surface anchoring motif, full-length inp (114 kda), truncated inp (inp-nc, 33 kda), and inp's n-domain with first two subunits (inp-n, 22 kda) were evaluated. two vectors, pkk223-3 and pet22b(+), with different promoters (t7 and tac) were used  to construct the fusion genes, and for each vector, three recombinant strains, each expressing a different length of the fusion protein, were obtained. sds-page, western blot, immunofluorescence microscopy, facs, and whole-cell elisa confirmed the expression of fusion proteins on the surface of e. coli. the smallest fusion protein with inp-n as the anchoring motif had the highest expression level and ca activity, suggesting that inp-n is the best carrying protein due to its smaller size. also, the t7 promoter in pet22b(+) induced with  0.2 mm iptg gave high protein expression levels, whereas the tac promoter in pkk223-3 gave low expression levels. the surface displayed ca was at least twofold more stable than that of the free form, and did not show any adverse effect on cell growth and outer membrane integrity. cells with surface displayed  ca were successfully used to facilitate co(2) sequestration in contained liquid membrane (clm).

TI  == cis-antisense rna, another level of gene regulation in bacteria.
AB  == a substantial amount of antisense transcription is a hallmark of gene expression  in eukaryotes. however, antisense transcription was first demonstrated in bacteria almost 50 years ago. the transcriptomes of bacteria as different as helicobacter pylori, bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli, synechocystis sp. strain pcc6803, mycoplasma pneumoniae, sinorhizobium meliloti, geobacter sulfurreducens, vibrio cholerae, chlamydia trachomatis, pseudomonas syringae, and staphylococcus aureus have now been reported to contain antisense rna (asrna) transcripts for a high percentage of genes. bacterial asrnas share functional similarities with trans-acting regulatory rnas, but in addition, they use their own distinct mechanisms. among their confirmed functional roles are transcription termination, codegradation, control of translation, transcriptional interference, and enhanced stability of their respective target transcripts. here, we review recent publications indicating that asrnas occur as frequently in simple unicellular bacteria as they do in higher organisms, and we provide a comprehensive overview of the experimentally confirmed characteristics of asrna actions and intimately linked quantitative aspects. emerging functional data suggest that asrnas in bacteria mediate a plethora of effects and are involved in far more processes than were previously anticipated. thus, the functional impact  of asrnas should be considered when developing new strategies against pathogenic  bacteria and when optimizing bacterial strains for biotechnology.

TI  == differential in vitro and in vivo effect of barley cysteine and serine protease inhibitors on phytopathogenic microorganisms.
AB  == protease inhibitors from plants have been involved in defence mechanisms against  pests and pathogens. phytocystatins and trypsin/alpha-amylase inhibitors are two  of the best characterized protease inhibitor families in plants. in barley, thirteen cystatins (hvcpi-1 to 13) and the bti-cme trypsin inhibitor have been previously studied. their capacity to inhibit pest digestive proteases, and the negative in vivo effect caused by plants expressing these inhibitors on pests support the defence function of these proteins. barley cystatins are also able to inhibit in vitro fungal growth. however, the antifungal effect of these inhibitors in vivo had not been previously tested. moreover, their in vitro and in vivo effect on plant pathogenous bacteria is still unknown. in order to obtain new insights on this feature, in vitro assays were made against different bacterial and fungal pathogens of plants using the trypsin inhibitor bti-cme and  the thirteen barley cystatins. most barley cystatins and the bti-cme inhibitor were able to inhibit mycelial growth but no bacterial growth. transgenic arabidopsis plants independently expressing the bti-cme inhibitor and the cystatin hvcpi-6 were tested against the same bacterial and fungal pathogens. neither the hvcpi-6 expressing transgenic plants nor the bti-cme ones were more resistant to plant pathogen fungi and bacteria than control arabidopsis plants. the differences observed between the in vitro and in planta assays against phytopathogenic fungi are discussed.

TI  == pseudomonas sax genes overcome aliphatic isothiocyanate-mediated non-host resistance in arabidopsis.
AB  == most plant-microbe interactions do not result in disease; natural products restrict non-host pathogens. we found that sulforaphane (4-methylsulfinylbutyl isothiocyanate), a natural product derived from aliphatic glucosinolates, inhibits growth in arabidopsis of non-host pseudomonas bacteria in planta. multiple sax genes (saxcab/f/d/g) were identified in pseudomonas species virulent on arabidopsis. these sax genes are required to overwhelm isothiocyanate-based defenses and facilitate a disease outcome, especially in the young leaves critical for plant survival. introduction of saxcab genes into non-host strains enabled them to overcome these arabidopsis defenses. our study shows that aliphatic isothiocyanates, previously shown to limit damage by herbivores, are also crucial, robust, and developmentally regulated defenses that underpin non-host resistance in the arabidopsis-pseudomonas pathosystem.

TI  == two flagellar stators and their roles in motility and virulence in pseudomonas syringae pv. tabaci 6605.
AB  == the motor proteins around the flagellar basal body consist of two cytoplasmic membrane proteins, mota and motb, and function as a complex that acts as the stator to generate the torque that drives rotation. genome analysis of several pseudomonas syringae pathovars revealed that there are two sets of genes encoding motor proteins: motab and motcd. deduced amino acid sequences for mota/b and motc/d showed homologies to the h(+)-driven stator from escherichia coli and na(+)-driven stator from vibrio alginolyticus, respectively. however, the swimming motility of p. syringae pv. tabaci (pta) 6605 was inhibited by the protonophore carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone but not by the sodium stator-specific inhibitor phenamil. to identify a gene encoding the stator protein required for motility, motab, motcd, and motabcd mutants were generated.  the motcd mutant had remarkably reduced and the motabcd mutant completely abolished swimming motilities, whereas the motab mutant retained some degree of these abilities. the motcd and motabcd mutants did not produce n-acyl-homoserine  lactones (ahls), quorum-sensing molecules in this pathogen, and remarkably reduced the ability to cause disease in host tobacco leaves, as we previously observed in the flic mutant strain. these results strongly indicate that both stator pairs in pta 6605 are proton-dependent and that motcd is important for not only flagellar motility but also for production of ahls and the ability to cause  disease in host plants.

AB  == the gene encoding d-phenylserine dehydrogenase from pseudomonas syringae nk-15 was identified, and a 9,246-bp nucleotide sequence containing the gene was sequenced. six orfs were confirmed in the sequenced region, four of which were predicted to form an operon. a homology search of each orf predicted that orf3 encoded l-phenylserine dehydrogenase. hence, orf3 was cloned and overexpressed in escherichia coli cells and recombinant orf3 was purified to homogeneity and characterized. the purified orf3 enzyme showed l-phenylserine dehydrogenase activity. the enzymological properties and primary structure of l-phenylserine dehydrogenase (orf3) were quite different from those of d-phenylserine dehydrogenase previously reported. l-phenylserine dehydrogenase catalyzed the nad(+)-dependent oxidation of the beta-hydroxyl group of l-beta-phenylserine. l-phenylserine and l-threo-(2-thienyl)serine were good substrates for l-phenylserine dehydrogenase. the genes encoding l-phenylserine dehydrogenase and d-phenylserine dehydrogenase, which is induced by phenylserine, are located in a  single operon. the reaction products of both enzymatic reactions were 2-aminoacetophenone and co(2).

TI  == functional characterization of replication and stability factors of an incompatibility group p-1 plasmid from xylella fastidiosa.
AB  == xylella fastidiosa strain riv11 harbors a 25-kbp plasmid (pxf-riv11) belonging to the incp-1 incompatibility group. replication and stability factors of pxf-riv11  were identified and used to construct plasmids able to replicate in x. fastidiosa and escherichia coli. replication in x. fastidiosa required a 1.4-kbp region from pxf-riv11 containing a replication initiation gene (trfa) and the adjacent origin of dna replication (oriv). constructs containing trfa and oriv from pveis01, a related incp-1 plasmid of the earthworm symbiont verminephrobacter eiseniae, also were competent for replication in x. fastidiosa. constructs derived from pxf-riv11 but not pveis01 replicated in agrobacterium tumefaciens, xanthomonas campestris, and pseudomonas syringae. although plasmids bearing replication elements from pxf-riv11 or pveis01 could be maintained in x. fastidiosa under antibiotic selection, removal of selection resulted in plasmid extinction after 3 weekly passages. addition of a toxin-antitoxin addiction system (pemi/pemk) from  pxf-riv11 improved plasmid stability such that >80 to 90% of x. fastidiosa cells  retained plasmid after 5 weekly passages in the absence of antibiotic selection.  expression of pemk in e. coli was toxic for cell growth, but toxicity was nullified by coexpression of pemi antitoxin. deletion of n-terminal sequences of  pemk containing the conserved motif rgd abolished toxicity. in vitro assays revealed a direct interaction of pemi with pemk, suggesting that antitoxin activity of pemi is mediated by toxin sequestration. incp-1 plasmid replication and stability factors were added to an e. coli cloning vector to constitute a stable 6.0-kbp shuttle vector (pxf20-pemik) suitable for use in x. fastidiosa.

TI  == economical evolution: microbes reduce the synthetic cost of extracellular proteins.
AB  == protein evolution is not simply a race toward improved function. because organisms compete for limited resources, fitness is also affected by the relative economy of an organism's proteome. indeed, many abundant proteins contain relatively high percentages of amino acids that are metabolically less taxing for the cell to make, thus reducing cellular cost. however, not all abundant proteins are economical, and many economical proteins are not particularly abundant. here  we examined protein composition and found that the relative synthetic cost of amino acids constrains the composition of microbial extracellular proteins. in escherichia coli, extracellular proteins contain, on average, fewer energetically expensive amino acids independent of their abundance, length, function, or structure. economic pressures have strategically shaped the amino acid composition of multicomponent surface appendages, such as flagella, curli, and type i pili, and extracellular enzymes, including type iii effector proteins and  secreted serine proteases. furthermore, in silico analysis of pseudomonas syringae, mycobacterium tuberculosis, saccharomyces cerevisiae, and over 25 other microbes spanning a wide range of gc content revealed a broad bias toward more economical amino acids in extracellular proteins. the synthesis of any protein, especially those rich in expensive aromatic amino acids, represents a significant investment. because extracellular proteins are lost to the environment and not recycled like other cellular proteins, they present a greater burden on the cell, as their amino acids cannot be reutilized during translation. we hypothesize that evolution has optimized extracellular proteins to reduce their synthetic burden on the cell.

AB  == the efem protein is a component of the putative efeuobm iron-transporter of pseudomonas syringae pathovar syringae and is thought to act as a periplasmic, ferrous-iron binding protein. it contains a signal peptide of 34 amino acid residues and a c-terminal 'peptidase_m75' domain of 251 residues. the c-terminal  domain contains a highly conserved 'hxxe' motif thought to act as part of a divalent cation-binding site. in this work, the gene (efem or 'psyr_3370') encoding efem was cloned and over-expressed in escherichia coli, and the mature protein was purified from the periplasm. mass spectrometry confirmed the identity of the protein (m(w) 27,772da). circular dichroism spectroscopy of efem indicated a mainly alpha-helical structure, consistent with bioinformatic predictions. purified efem was crystallised by hanging-drop vapor diffusion to give needle-shaped crystals that diffracted to a resolution of 1.6a. this is the first molecular study of a peptidase m75 domain with a presumed iron transport role.

TI  == interference of quorum sensing in pseudomonas syringae by bacterial epiphytes that limit iron availability.
AB  == leaf surfaces harbour bacterial epiphytes that are capable of influencing the quorum sensing (qs) system, density determination through detection of diffusible signal molecules, of the plant-pathogen pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae (pss) which controls expression of extracellular polysaccharide production, motility and other factors contributing to virulence to plants. approximately 11% of the bacterial epiphytes recovered from a variety of plants produced a diffusible factor capable of inhibiting the qs system of pss as indicated by suppression of  ahli. blockage of qs by these interfering strains correlated strongly with their  ability to limit iron availability to pss. a direct relationship between the ability of isogenic escherichia coli strains to sequester iron via their production of different siderophores and their ability to suppress qs in pss was  also observed. quorum sensing induction was inversely related to iron availability in culture media supplemented with iron chelators or with fecl(3). co-inoculation of interfering strains with pss onto leaves increased the number of resultant disease lesions over twofold compared with that on plants inoculated with pss alone. transposon-generated mutants of interfering strains in which qs inhibition was blocked did not increase disease when co-inoculated with pss. increased disease incidence was also not observed when a non-motile mutant of pss was co-inoculated onto plants with qs interfering bacteria suggesting that these  strains enhanced the motility of pss in an iron-dependent manner, leading to an apparent increase in virulence of this pathogen. considerable cross-talk mediated by iron scavenging apparently occurs on plants, thereby altering the behaviour of bacteria such as pss that exhibit important qs-dependent traits in this habitat.

TI  == specific and rapid enumeration of viable but nonculturable and viable-culturable  gram-negative bacteria by using flow cytometry.
AB  == an issue of critical concern in microbiology is the ability to detect viable but  nonculturable (vbnc) and viable-culturable (vc) cells by methods other than existing approaches. culture methods are selective and underestimate the real population, and other options (direct viable count and the double-staining method using epifluorescence microscopy and inhibitory substance-influenced molecular methods) are also biased and time-consuming. a rapid approach that reduces selectivity, decreases bias from sample storage and incubation, and reduces assay time is needed. flow cytometry is a sensitive analytical technique that can rapidly monitor physiological states of bacteria. this report outlines a method to optimize staining protocols and the flow cytometer (fcm) instrument settings for the enumeration of vbnc and vc bacterial cells within 70 min. experiments were performed using the fcm to quantify vbnc and vc escherichia coli o157:h7, pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas syringae, and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium cells after staining with different fluorescent probes: syto 9, syto  13, syto 17, syto 40, and propidium iodide (pi). the fcm data were compared with  those for specific standard nutrient agar to enumerate the number of cells in different states. by comparing results from cultures at late log phase, 1 to 64%  of cells were nonculturable, 40 to 98% were culturable, and 0.7 to 4.5% had damaged cell membranes and were therefore theoretically dead. data obtained using four different gram-negative bacteria exposed to heat and stained with pi also illustrate the usefulness of the approach for the rapid and unbiased detection of dead versus live organisms.

TI  == all three subunits of recbcd enzyme are essential for dna repair and low-temperature growth in the antarctic pseudomonas syringae lz4w.
AB  == background: the recd mutants of the antarctic pseudomonas syringae lz4w are sensitive to dna-damaging agents and fail to grow at 4 degrees c. generally, recd associates with two other proteins (recb and recc) to produce recbcd enzyme, which is involved in homologous recombination and dna repair in many bacteria, including escherichia coli. however, recd is not essential for dna repair, nor does its deletion cause any growth defects in e. coli. hence, the assessment of the p. syringae recbcd pathway was imperative. methodology/principal findings: mutational analysis and genetic complementation studies were used to establish that the individual null-mutations of all three genes, recc, recb, and recd, or the deletion of whole reccbd operon of p. syringae, lead to growth inhibition at  low temperature, and sensitivity to uv and mitomycin c. viability of the mutant cells dropped drastically at 4 degrees c, and the mutants accumulated linear chromosomal dna and shorter dna fragments in higher amounts compared to 22 degrees c. additional genetic data using the mutant recbcd enzymes that were inactivated either in the atpase active site of recb (recb(k29q)) or recd (recd(k229q)), or in the nuclease center of recb (recb(d1118a) and recb(delta nuc)) suggested that, while the nuclease activity of recb is not so critical in vivo, the atp-dependent functions of both recb and recd are essential. surprisingly, e. coli recbcd or recbc alone on plasmid could complement the defects of the delta reccbd strain of p. syringae. conclusions/significance: all  three subunits of the recbcd(ps) enzyme are essential for dna repair and growth of p. syringae at low temperatures (4 degrees c). the recd requirement is only a  function of the recbcd complex in the bacterium. the recbcd pathway protects the  antarctic bacterium from cold-induced dna damages, and is critically dependent on the helicase activities of both recb and recd subunits, but not on the nuclease of recbcd(ps) enzyme.

AB  == the perception of pathogen-derived elicitors by plants has been suggested to involve phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase-c (pi-plc) signalling. here we show that plc isoforms are required for the hypersensitive response (hr) and disease resistance. we characterised the tomato [solanum lycopersicum (sl)] plc gene family. six sl plc-encoding cdnas were isolated and their expression in response to infection with the pathogenic fungus cladosporium fulvum was studied. we found significant regulation at the transcriptional level of the various slplcs, and slplc4 and slplc6 showed distinct expression patterns in c. fulvum-resistant cf-4 tomato. we produced the encoded proteins in escherichia coli and found that both genes encode catalytically active pi-plcs. to test the requirement of these sl plcs for full cf-4-mediated recognition of the effector avr4, we knocked down the expression of the encoding genes by virus-induced gene  silencing. silencing of slplc4 impaired the avr4/cf-4-induced hr and resulted in  increased colonisation of cf-4 plants by c. fulvum expressing avr4. furthermore,  expression of the gene in nicotiana benthamiana enhanced the avr4/cf-4-induced hr. silencing of slplc6 did not affect hr, whereas it caused increased colonisation of cf-4 plants by the fungus. interestingly, sl plc6, but not sl plc4, was also required for resistance to verticillium dahliae, mediated by the transmembrane ve1 resistance protein, and to pseudomonas syringae, mediated by the intracellular pto/prf resistance protein couple. we conclude that there is a  differential requirement of plc isoforms for the plant immune response and that sl plc4 is specifically required for cf-4 function, while sl plc6 may be a more general component of resistance protein signalling.

TI  == isolation of novel pseudomonas syringae promoters and functional characterization in polyhydroxyalkanoate-producing pseudomonads.
AB  == a library of genomic dna fragments of pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato dc3000 was  constructed in a laczalpha-containing plasmid, pbs29. the library was used in a preliminary alpha-complementation-based screen to identify clones with promoter activity in escherichia coli. ten positive clones were sequenced and their locations in the chromosomal dna of dc3000 strain were mapped. five positive clones (p2, p3, p4, p6 and p8) were further assayed for promoter activity in three polyhydroxyalkanoate-producing pseudomonads: pseudomonas resinovorans, p. corrugata and p. chlororaphis. to this end, a green-fluorescent-protein gene (gfp) was cloned downstream from the putative (dc3000) promoter in a shuttle plasmid. we found that only pseudomonas transformants harboring the gfp-containing plasmid driven by putative promoter p2 showed fluorescence, indicating that this promoter is functioning in the three tested pseudomonads. results of an in silico analysis of the p2 sequence further support the assignment of p2 as a bona fide promoter by the localization of putative -10 and  -35 promoter regions and a transcription-factor-binding site, rpod17, in this sequence. we successfully applied promoter p2 to drive the expression in p. chlororaphis of a recombinant alpha-galactosidase gene of streptomyces coelicolor, which should be useful for the utilization of oligosaccharides of soy molasses for the production of polyhydroxyalkanoate biopolymer or rhamnolipid biosurfactant.

TI  == the pepper 9-lipoxygenase gene calox1 functions in defense and cell death responses to microbial pathogens.
AB  == lipoxygenases (loxs) are crucial for lipid peroxidation processes during plant defense responses to pathogen infection. a pepper (capsicum annuum) 9-lox gene, calox1, which encodes a 9-specific lipoxygenase, was isolated from pepper leaves. recombinant calox1 protein expressed in escherichia coli catalyzed the hydroperoxidation of linoleic acid, with a k(m) value of 113. 9 mum. expression of calox1 was differentially induced in pepper leaves not only during xanthomonas campestris pv vesicatoria (xcv) infection but also after exposure to abiotic elicitors. transient expression of calox1 in pepper leaves induced the cell death phenotype and defense responses. calox1-silenced pepper plants were more susceptible to xcv and colletotrichum coccodes infection, which was accompanied by reduced expression of defense-related genes, lowered lipid peroxidation, as well as decreased reactive oxygen species and lowered salicylic acid accumulation. infection with xcv, especially in an incompatible interaction, rapidly stimulated lox activity in unsilenced, but not calox1-silenced, pepper leaves. furthermore, overexpression of calox1 in arabidopsis (arabidopsis thaliana) conferred enhanced resistance to pseudomonas syringae pv tomato, hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis, and alternaria brassicicola. in contrast, mutation of the arabidopsis calox1 ortholog atlox1 significantly increased susceptibility to these three pathogens. together, these results suggest that calox1 and atlox1 positively regulate defense and cell death responses to microbial pathogens.

TI  == crystal structures of pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato dc3000 quinone oxidoreductase and its complex with nadph.
AB  == zeta-crystallin-like quinone oxidoreductase is nad(p)h-dependent and catalyzes one-electron reduction of certain quinones to generate semiquinone. here we present the crystal structures of zeta-crystallin-like quinone oxidoreductase from pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato dc3000 (ptoqor) and its complexes with nadph determined at 2.4 and 2.01a resolutions, respectively. ptoqor forms as a homologous dimer, each monomer containing two domains. in the structure of the ptoqor-nadph complex, nadph locates in the groove between the two domains. nadph  binding causes obvious conformational changes in the structure of ptoqor. the putative substrate-binding site of ptoqor is wider than that of escherichia coli  and thermus thermophilus hb8. activity assays show that ptoqor has weak 1,4-benzoquinone catalytic activity, and very strong reduction activity towards large substrates such as 9,10-phenanthrenequinone. we propose a model to explain  the conformational changes which take place during reduction reactions catalyzed  by ptoqor.

TI  == concentrations of host-specific and generic fecal markers measured by quantitative pcr in raw sewage and fresh animal feces.
AB  == we measured the concentrations of four host-specific (human, dog, cow, and horse  bacteroidales), four generic fecal (16s total bacteroidales and escherichia coli, 23s enterococcus and uida e. coli,) and two universal bacterial (16s universal and rpob universal) dna targets by qpcr in raw sewage and pooled fecal samples from dogs, cows, horses, and canada geese. a spiking protocol using the non-fecal bacterium pseudomonas syringae pph 6 was developed to estimate the recovery of dna from fecal and environmental samples. the measured fecal marker concentrations were used to calculate baseline ratios and variability of host-specific to generic indicators for each host type. the host-specific markers were found in high concentrations (8-9 log(10)copies/g dry wt.) in their respective hosts' samples, which were equal to or greater than the concentrations of generic e. coli and enterococcus markers, lending support to the use of host-specific and generic bacteroidales as sensitive indicators of fecal pollution. the host-specific markers formed a consistent percentage of total bacteroidales in target host feces and raw sewage, with human-specific comprising 82%, dog-specific 6%, cow-specific 4% and horse-specific 2%. based on this limited data set, the measurement of host-specific indicators by qpcr has several promising applications. these applications include determining the percentage of  total bacteroidales contributed by a specific host type, using the ratios of host-specific markers to e. coli or enterococcus to estimate the contribution of  each source to these regulated fecal indicator bacteria, and estimating the mass  of feces from each host type in environmental samples.

TI  == determinants for the activation and autoinhibition of the diguanylate cyclase response regulator wspr.
AB  == the bacterial second messenger bis-(3'-5')-cyclic dimeric guanosine monophosphate (c-di-gmp) controls secretion, cell adhesion, and motility, leading to biofilm formation and increased cytotoxicity. diguanylate cyclases containing ggdef and phosphodiesterases containing eal or hd-gyp domains have been identified as the enzymes controlling cellular c-di-gmp levels, yet less is known regarding the molecular mechanisms governing regulation and signaling specificity. we recently  determined a product-inhibition pathway for the diguanylate cyclase response regulator wspr from pseudomonas, a potent molecular switch that controls biofilm  formation. in wspr, catalytic activity is modulated by a helical stalk motif that connects its phospho-receiver and ggdef domains. the stalks facilitate the formation of distinct oligomeric states that contribute to both activation and autoinhibition. here, we provide novel insights into the regulation of diguanylate cyclase activity in wspr based on the crystal structures of full-length wspr, the isolated ggdef domain, and an artificially dimerized catalytic domain. the structures highlight that inhibition is achieved by restricting the mobility of rigid ggdef domains, mediated by c-di-gmp binding to  an inhibitory site at the ggdef domain. kinetic measurements and biochemical characterization corroborate a model in which the activation of wspr requires the formation of a tetrameric species. tetramerization occurs spontaneously at high protein concentration or upon addition of the phosphomimetic compound beryllium fluoride. our analyses elucidate common and wspr-specific mechanisms for the fine-tuning of diguanylate cyclase activity.

TI  == improved phosphate biosorption by bacterial surface display of phosphate-binding  protein utilizing ice nucleation protein.
AB  == the conventional enhanced biological phosphorus removal (ebpr) system often deteriorates at low chemical oxygen demand (cod) or under aeration conditions. a  new approach that incorporates phosphate-eutrophic wastewater remediation was introduced through immobilization of an intracellular phosphate-binding protein (pbp) onto the surface of pseudomonas putida or escherichia coli, using the n-terminal anchor (inaq-n) of a newly identified ice nucleation protein from pseudomonas syringae. a green fluorescent protein-fusion protein was expressed and used to confirm surface localization. the pbp was then targeted to the surface of e. coli jm109 and p. putida ab92019. the engineered p. putida and e. coli microorganisms were capable of absolute biosorption of total phosphates at rates of 60 and 80 mg l(-1), respectively, over 5 h. in the recombinant p. putida cells, a surface-immobilized pbp fusion that had three tandemly repeated inaq-ns  exhibited the maximum increment in phosphate biosorption, at sixfold compared with the control strain. even heat-killed recombinant cells of either p. putida or e. coli retained substantial biosorptive activities. the current study demonstrates that the bacterial surface display of pbp should be considered as a  strong contender for generating organisms capable of functioning in ebpr systems  under low cod, resulting in improved removal of eutrophic phosphorus from wastewaters.

TI  == loss of calmodulin binding to bax inhibitor-1 affects pseudomonas-mediated hypersensitive response-associated cell death in arabidopsis thaliana.
AB  == bax inhibitor-1 (bi-1) is a cell death suppressor protein conserved across a variety of organisms. the arabidopsis atbi1-1 plant is a mutant in which the c-terminal 6 amino acids of the expressed bi-1 protein have been replaced by t-dna insertion. this mutant bi-1 protein (atbi-cm) produced in escherichia coli  can no longer bind to calmodulin. a promoter-reporter assay demonstrated compartmentalized expression of bi-1 during hypersensitive response, introduced by the inoculation of pseudomonas syringae possessing the avrrtp2 gene, pst(avrrpt2). in addition, both bi-1 knockdown plants and atbi1-1 showed increased sensitivity to pst(avrrpt2)-induced cell death. the results indicated that the loss of calmodulin binding reduces the cell death suppressor activity of bi-1 in planta.

AB  == background: the vibrio parahaemolyticus type iii secreted effector vops contains  a fic domain that covalently modifies rho gtpase threonine with amp to inhibit downstream signaling events in host cells. the vops fic domain includes a conserved sequence motif (hpfx[d/e]gn[g/k]r) that contributes to ampylation. fic  domains are found in a variety of species, including bacteria, a few archaea, and metazoan eukaryotes. methodology/principal findings: we show that the ampylation  activity extends to a eukaryotic fic domain in drosophila melanogaster cg9523, and use sequence and structure based computational methods to identify related domains in doc toxins and the type iii effector avrb. the conserved sequence motif that contributes to ampylation unites fic with doc. although avrb lacks this motif, its structure reveals a similar topology to the fic and doc folds. avrb binds to a peptide fragment of its host virulence target in a similar manner as fic binds peptide substrate. avrb also orients a phosphate group from a bound  adp ligand near the peptide-binding site and in a similar position as a bound fic phosphate. conclusions/significance: the demonstrated eukaryotic fic domain ampylation activity suggests that the vops effector has exploited a novel host posttranslational modification. fic domain-related structures give insight to the ampylation active site and to the vops fic domain interaction with its host gtpase target. these results suggest that fic, doc, and avrb stem from a common ancestor that has evolved to ampylate protein substrates.

AB  == almost all of the chlorine-containing gas emitted from natural sources is methyl  chloride (ch(3)cl), which contributes to the destruction of the stratospheric ozone layer. tropical and subtropical plants emit substantial amounts of ch(3)cl. a gene involved in ch(3)cl emission from arabidopsis was previously identified and designated harmless to ozone layer (hereafter athol1) based on the mutant phenotype. our previous studies demonstrated that athol1 and its homologs, athol2 and athol3, have s-adenosyl-l-methionine-dependent methyltransferase activities.  however, the physiological functions of athols have yet to be elucidated. in the  present study, our comparative kinetic analyses with possible physiological substrates indicated that all of the athols have low activities toward chloride.  athol1 was highly reactive to thiocyanate (ncs(-)), a pseudohalide, synthesizing  methylthiocyanate (ch(3)scn) with a very high k(cat)/k(m) value. we demonstrated  in vivo that substantial amounts of ncs(-) were synthesized upon tissue damage in arabidopsis and that ncs(-) was largely derived from myrosinase-mediated hydrolysis of glucosinolates. analyses with the t-dna insertion arabidopsis mutants (hol1, hol2, and hol3) revealed that only hol1 showed increased sensitivity to ncs(-) in medium and a concomitant lack of ch(3)scn synthesis upon tissue damage. bacterial growth assays indicated that the conversion of ncs(-) into ch(3)scn dramatically increased antibacterial activities against arabidopsis pathogens that normally invade the wound site. furthermore, hol1 seedlings showed an increased susceptibility toward an arabidopsis pathogen, pseudomonas syringae  pv. maculicola. here we propose that athol1 is involved in glucosinolate metabolism and defense against phytopathogens. moreover, ch(3)cl synthesized by athol1 could be considered a byproduct of ncs(-) metabolism.

AB  == genes encoding proteins that exhibit similarity to the c-terminal domain of escherichia coli colicin m were identified in the genomes of some pseudomonas species, namely, p. aeruginosa, p. syringae, and p. fluorescens. these genes were detected only in a restricted number of strains. in p. aeruginosa, for instance,  the colicin m homologue gene was located within the exou-containing genomic island a, a large horizontally acquired genetic element and virulence determinant. here we report the cloning of these genes from the three pseudomonas species and the purification and biochemical characterization of the different colicin m homologues. all of them were shown to exhibit mg(2+)-dependent diphosphoric diester hydrolase activity toward the two undecaprenyl phosphate-linked peptidoglycan precursors (lipids i and ii) in vitro. in all cases, the site of cleavage was localized between the undecaprenyl and pyrophospho-murnac moieties of these precursors. these enzymes were not active on the cytoplasmic precursor udp-murnac-pentapeptide or (or only very poorly) on undecaprenyl pyrophosphate. these colicin m homologues have a narrow range of antibacterial activity. the p. aeruginosa protein at low concentrations was shown to inhibit growth of sensitive p. aeruginosa strains. these proteins thus represent a new class of bacteriocins (pyocins), the first ones reported thus far in the genus pseudomonas that target peptidoglycan metabolism.

AB  == genome-informed identification and characterization of type iii effector repertoires in various bacterial strains and species is revealing important insights into the critical roles that these proteins play in the pathogenic strategies of diverse bacteria. however, non-systematic discipline-specific approaches to their annotation impede analysis of the accumulating wealth of data and inhibit easy communication of findings among researchers working on different experimental systems. the development of gene ontology (go) terms to capture biological processes occurring during the interaction between organisms creates a common language that facilitates cross-genome analyses. the application of these  terms to annotate type iii effector genes in different bacterial species - the plant pathogen pseudomonas syringae pv tomato dc3000 and animal pathogenic strains of escherichia coli - illustrates how go can effectively describe fundamental similarities and differences among different gene products deployed as part of diverse pathogenic strategies. in depth descriptions of the go annotations for p. syringae pv tomato dc3000 effector avrptob and the e. coli effector tir are described, with special emphasis given to go capability for capturing information about interacting proteins and taxa. go-highlighted similarities in biological process and molecular function for effectors from additional pathosystems are also discussed.

AB  == vibrio parahaemolyticus is a moderately halophilic bacterium found in estuarine and marine coastal ecosystems worldwide. although the ability of v. parahaemolyticus to grow and proliferate in fluctuating saline environments is well known, the underlying molecular mechanisms of osmoadaptation are unknown. we performed an in silico analysis of v. parahaemolyticus strain rimd2210633 for genes homologous to osmotic stress response genes in other bacteria. we uncovered two putative compatible solute synthesis systems (encoded by ectabc and betabi) and six putative compatible solute transporters (encoded by four bcct loci and two provwx loci). an ectoine synthesis system clustered with a betaine/carnitine/choline transporter and a prou transporter (encoded by homologues of provwx from escherichia coli), and a betaine synthesis system clustered with a prou transporter (encoded by homologues of provxw from pseudomonas syringae). this is at least double the number present in v. cholerae, v. fischeri, or v. vulnificus. six additional vibrio species contain both ectabc  and betabi, i.e., v. alginolyticus 12g01, v. angustum, v. harveyi baa-1116, v. splendidus lgp32, vibrio sp. strain med222, and vibrio sp. strain ex25. v. harveyi hy01 and v. splendidus 12b01 only encoded the betaine system. in addition, v. alginolyticus had a compendium of systems identical to that found in v. parahaemolyticus. comparative physiological analysis of rimd2210633 with v. vulnificus yj016, v. cholerae n16961, and v. fischeri es114 grown at different salinities and temperatures demonstrated that v. parahaemolyticus had a growth advantage under all of the conditions examined. we demonstrate, by one-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance analysis, that v. parahaemolyticus is  capable of de novo synthesis of ectoine at high salinity whereas a delta ectb knockout strain is not. we constructed a single-knockout mutation in prou1, but no growth defect was noted, indicating transporter system redundancy. we complemented e. coli mkh13, a compatible solute transporter-negative strain, with bcct2 and demonstrated uptake of betaine at high salt concentrations.

AB  == exoribonucleolytic and endoribonucleolytic activities are important for controlled degradation of rna and contribute to the regulation of gene expression at the posttranscriptional level by influencing the half-lives of specific messenger rnas. the rna half-lives are determined by the characteristics of the rna substrates and by the availability and the properties of the involved proteins-ribonucleases and assisting polypeptides. much is known about rna degradation in eukarya and bacteria, but there is limited information about rna-degrading enzymes and rna destabilizing or stabilizing elements in the domain of the archaea. the recent progress in the understanding of the structure and function of the archaeal exosome, a protein complex with rna-degrading and rna-tailing capabilities, has given some first insights into the mechanisms of rna degradation in the third domain of life and into the evolution of rna-degrading enzymes. moreover, other archaeal rnases with degrading potential have been described and a new mechanism for protection of the 5'-end of rna in archaea was discovered. here, we summarize the current knowledge on rna degradation in the archaea. additionally, rna degradation mechanisms in rhodobacter capsulatus and pseudomonas syringae are compared to those in the major model organism for gram-negatives, escherichia coli, which dominates our view on rna degradation in bacteria.

TI  == production of glucaric acid from a synthetic pathway in recombinant escherichia coli.
AB  == a synthetic pathway has been constructed for the production of glucuronic and glucaric acids from glucose in escherichia coli. coexpression of the genes encoding myo-inositol-1-phosphate synthase (ino1) from saccharomyces cerevisiae and myo-inositol oxygenase (miox) from mice led to production of glucuronic acid  through the intermediate myo-inositol. glucuronic acid concentrations up to 0.3 g/liter were measured in the culture broth. the activity of miox was rate limiting, resulting in the accumulation of both myo-inositol and glucuronic acid  as final products, in approximately equal concentrations. inclusion of a third enzyme, uronate dehydrogenase (udh) from pseudomonas syringae, facilitated the conversion of glucuronic acid to glucaric acid. the activity of this recombinant  enzyme was more than 2 orders of magnitude higher than that of ino1 and miox and  increased overall flux through the pathway such that glucaric acid concentrations in excess of 1 g/liter were observed. this represents a novel microbial system for the biological production of glucaric acid, a "top value-added chemical" from biomass.

AB  == pantoea stewartii subsp. stewartii (pnss) causes stewart's bacterial wilt of sweet corn and leaf blight of maize. the pathogenicity of pnss depends on synthesis of extracellular polysaccharide and an hrp type iii secretion system. wtse, a type iii secreted effector protein, is essential for the virulence of pnss on corn. it belongs to the avre family of effectors, which includes dspa/e from erwinia amylovora and avre1 from pseudomonas syringae. previously, wtse was  shown to cause disease-associated cell death in its host plant, sweet corn. here, we examine the biological activity of wtse in several non-host plants. wtse induced cell death in nicotiana benthamiana, tobacco, beet and arabidopsis thaliana when it was transiently produced in plant cells following agroinfiltration or translocated into plant cells from pnss, escherichia coli or  pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola (pph). wtse-induced cell death in n. benthamiana, tobacco and beet resembled a hypersensitive response and in n. benthamiana it was delayed by cycloheximide. interestingly, wtse strongly promoted the growth of pnss in n. benthamiana prior to the onset of cell death. deletion derivatives of wtse that failed to induce cell death in n. benthamiana and tobacco also did not complement wtse mutants of pnss for virulence in sweet corn, indicating a correlation between the two activities. wtse also induced cell death in a. thaliana, where it suppressed basal defences induced by pph. thus, wtse has growth-promoting, defence-suppressing and cell death-inducing activities in non-host plants. expression of wtse also prevented the growth of yeast, possibly due to an innate toxicity to eukaryotic cells.

AB  == gene clusters encoding various type iii secretion system (t3ss) injectisomes, frequently code downstream of the conserved atpase gene for small hydrophilic proteins whose amino acid sequences display a propensity for intrinsic disorder and coiled-coil formation. these properties were confirmed experimentally for a member of this class, the hrpo protein from the t3ss of pseudomonas syringae pv phaseolicola: hrpo exhibits high alpha-helical content with coiled-coil characteristics, strikingly low melting temperature, structural properties that are typical for disordered proteins, and a pronounced self-association propensity, most likely via coiled-coil interactions, resulting in heterogeneous  populations of quaternary complexes. hrpo interacts in vivo with hrpe, a t3ss protein for which coiled-coil formation is also strongly predicted. evidence from hrpo analogues from all t3ss families and the flagellum suggests that the extreme flexibility and propensity for coiled-coil interactions of this diverse class of  small, intrinsically disordered proteins, whose structures may alter as they bind to their cognate folded protein targets, might be important elements in the establishment of protein-protein interaction networks required for t3ss function.

TI  == the role of host protein yajq in the temporal control of transcription in bacteriophage phi6.
AB  == bacteriophage phi6 contains three dsrna genomic segments l, m, and s. the rna is  located inside a core particle composed of multiple copies of a major structural  protein, an rna-dependent rna polymerase, a hexameric ntpase, and an auxiliary protein. the virion rna polymerase in the core particle transcribes segments m and s in vitro. yet early in infection, the transcription of l is highly active.  late in infection, transcription of l is low, and that of m and s is high. a host protein encoded by yajq is responsible for the activation of l transcription. knockout mutants of yajq do not support the replication of phi6, although they do support the replication of distantly related members of the cystoviridae. phi6 can mutate to independence of yajq. this requires two mutations in the gene for the rna-dependent rna polymerase. yajq acts indirectly on the polymerase by binding to p1, the major structural protein of the core. previous studies have shown that the activity of the polymerase in the core is controlled by the conformation of the core particle structure.

TI  == beta-hydroxylation of the aspartyl residue in the phytotoxin syringomycin e: characterization of two candidate hydroxylases asph and syrp in pseudomonas syringae.
AB  == the pseudomonal phytotoxin syringomycin e and related nonribosomal peptides contain an l- threo-beta-hydroxyaspartyl residue at the eighth position of the lipodepsipeptide backbone as part of a conserved nonproteinogenic tripeptide motif. informatic analysis of the p. syringae genome suggests only one putative non-heme iron hydroxylase, asph. on heterologous expression in escherichia coli asph shows robust catalytic activity with free l-asp and l-asp thioesters to make beta-oh-asp but yields the erythro diastereomer rather than the threo configuration that is found in syringomycin. further analysis of the syr gene cluster indicated that syrp, previously annotated as the gene regulatory protein  for the five-gene syr cluster, is actually homologous to the known non-heme mononuclear iron hydroxylase taud. indeed, purified syrp acts on asp tethered as  the protein-bound s-pantetheinyl thioester on the eighth module of the syre megasynthetase. the hydroxylation gives the anticipated l- threo-3-oh-asp diastereomer found in syringomycin. the knockout of syrp abolishes the production of the mature syringomycin e, while knockout of asph has no effect on syringomycin production.

AB  == in this study, for the first time, functionally active, recombinant, cysteine-rich plant proteins snakin-1 (sn1) and defensin (pth1) were expressed and purified using a prokaryotic expression system. the overall level of antimicrobial activities of sn1 and pth1 produced in escherichia coli was commensurate with that of the same proteins previously obtained from plant tissues. both proteins exhibited strong antibacterial activity against the phytopathogenic bacterium clavibacter michiganensis subsp. sepedonicus (50% inhibitory concentration (ic(50)) 1.5-8 microm) and antifungal activity against the phytopathogenic fungi colletotrichum coccoides and botrytis cinerea (ic(50) 5-14 microm). significantly weaker activity was observed against pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae and pseudomonas syringae pv. tabaci. a pronounced synergistic antimicrobial effect against p. syringae pv. syringae and an additive effect against p. syringae pv. tabaci occurred with a combination of sn1 and pth1. aggregation of c. michiganensis subsp. sepedonicus bacterial cells at all protein concentrations tested was observed with the combination of sn1 and pth1 and with sn1 alone. our results demonstrate the use of a cost effective prokaryotic expression system for generation and in vitro characterization of plant cysteine-rich proteins with potential antimicrobial activities against a wide range of phytopathogenic microorganisms in order to select the most effective agents for future in vivo studies.

TI  == suppression of the microrna pathway by bacterial effector proteins.
AB  == plants and animals sense pathogen-associated molecular patterns (pamps) and in turn differentially regulate a subset of micrornas (mirnas). however, the extent  to which the mirna pathway contributes to innate immunity remains unknown. here,  we show that mirna-deficient mutants of arabidopsis partly restore growth of a type iii secretion-defective mutant of pseudomonas syringae. these mutants also sustained growth of nonpathogenic pseudomonas fluorescens and escherichia coli strains, implicating mirnas as key components of plant basal defense. accordingly, we have identified p. syringae effectors that suppress transcriptional activation of some pamp-responsive mirnas or mirna biogenesis, stability, or activity. these results provide evidence that, like viruses, bacteria have evolved to suppress rna silencing to cause disease.

TI  == a role for inositol hexakisphosphate in the maintenance of basal resistance to plant pathogens.
AB  == phytic acid (myo-inositol hexakisphosphate, insp6) is an important phosphate store and signal molecule in plants. however, low-phytate plants are being developed to minimize the negative health effects of dietary insp6 and pollution  caused by undigested insp6 in animal waste. insp6 levels were diminished in transgenic potato plants constitutively expressing an antisense gene sequence for myo-inositol 3-phosphate synthase (ips, catalysing the first step in insp6 biosynthesis) or escherichia coli polyphosphate kinase. these plants were less resistant to the avirulent pathogen potato virus y and the virulent pathogen tobacco mosaic virus (tmv). in arabidopsis thaliana, mutation of the gene for the enzyme catalysing the final step of insp6 biosynthesis (insp5 2-kinase) also diminished insp6 levels and enhanced susceptibility to tmv and to virulent and avirulent strains of the bacterial pathogen pseudomonas syringae. arabidopsis thaliana has three ips genes (atips1-3). mutant atips2 plants were depleted in insp6 and were hypersusceptible to tmv, turnip mosaic virus, cucumber mosaic virus and cauliflower mosaic virus as well as to the fungus botrytis cinerea and  to p. syringae. mutant atips2 and atipk1 plants were as hypersusceptible to infection as plants unable to accumulate salicylic acid (sa) but their increased  susceptibility was not due to reduced levels of sa. in contrast, mutant atips1 plants, which were also depleted in insp6, were not compromised in resistance to  pathogens, suggesting that a specific pool of insp6 regulates defence against phytopathogens.

TI  == osbirh1, a dead-box rna helicase with functions in modulating defence responses against pathogen infection and oxidative stress.
AB  == dead-box proteins comprise a large protein family with members from all kingdoms  and play important roles in all types of processes in rna metabolism. in this study, a rice gene osbirh1, which encodes a dead-box rna helicase protein, was cloned and characterized. the predicted osbirh1 protein contains a dead domain and all conserved motifs that are common characteristics of dead-box rna helicases. recombinant osbirh1 protein purified from escherichia coli was shown to have both rna-dependent atpase and atp-dependent rna helicase activities in vitro. expression of osbirh1 was activated in rice seedling leaves after treatment with defence-related signal chemicals, for example benzothiadiazole, salicylic acid, l-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid, and jasmonic acid, and was also up-regulated in an incompatible interaction between a resistant rice genotype and the blast fungus, magnaporthe grisea. transgenic arabidopsis plants  that overexpress the osbirh1 gene were generated. disease resistance phenotype assays revealed that the osbirh1-overexpressing transgenic plants showed an enhanced disease resistance against alternaria brassicicola and pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato dc3000. meanwhile, defence-related genes, for example pr-1, pr-2, pr-5, and pdf1.2, showed an up-regulated expression in the transgenic plants. moreover, the osbirh1 transgenic arabidopsis plants also showed increased tolerance to oxidative stress and elevated expression levels of oxidative defence genes, atapx1, atapx2, and atfsd1. the results suggest that osbirh1 encodes a functional dead-box rna helicase and plays important roles in defence responses against biotic and abiotic stresses.

TI  == electron paramagnetic resonance characterization of the copper-resistance protein pcoc from escherichia coli.
AB  == continuous-wave and pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance have been applied to the study of the cu(ii) site of the copper-resistance protein pcoc from escherichia coli and certain variant forms. electron spin echo envelope modulation (eseem) experiments confirm the presence of two histidine ligands, his1 and his92, at the cu(ii) site of wild-type pcoc, consistent with the available x-ray crystallographic data for the homolog copc (67% sequence identity) from pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato. the variants h1f and h92f each lack one of the histidine residues close to the cu(ii) site. the eseem data suggest that the surviving histidine residue remains as a ligand. the na variant  features an extra alanine residue at the n terminus, which demotes the his1 ligand to position 2. at least one of the two histidine residues is bound at the  cu(ii) site in this form. simulation of the (14)n superhyperfine structure in the continuous-wave spectra confirms the presence of at least three nitrogen-based ligands at the cu(ii) sites of the wild-type, h92f and na forms, while the h1f variant has two nitrogen ligands. the spectra of wild-type form can be fitted adequately with a 3n or a 4n model. the former is consistent with the crystal structure of the copc homolog, where his1 acts as a bidentate ligand. the latter  raises the possibility of an additional unidentified nitrogen ligand. the markedly different spectra of the h1f and na forms compared with the wild-type and h92f proteins further highlight the integral role of the n-terminal histidine residue in the high-affinity cu(ii) site of pcoc.

TI  == a novel gene, phca from pseudomonas syringae induces programmed cell death in the filamentous fungus neurospora crassa.

TI  == pseudomonas syringae bett is a low-affinity choline transporter that is responsible for superior osmoprotection by choline over glycine betaine.
AB  == the plant pathogen pseudomonas syringae derives better osmoprotection from choline than from glycine betaine, unlike most bacteria that have been characterized. in this report, we identified a betaine/carnitine/choline family transporter (bcct) in p. syringae pv. tomato strain dc3000 that mediates the transport of choline and acetylcholine. this transporter has a particularly low affinity (k(m) of 876 microm) and high capacity (v(max) of 80 nmol/min/mg of protein) for choline transport relative to other known bccts. although bett activity increased in response to hyperosmolarity, bett mediated significant uptake under low-osmolarity conditions, suggesting a role in transport for both osmoprotection and catabolism. growth studies with mutants deficient in bett and  other choline transporters demonstrated that bett was responsible for the superior osmoprotection conferred to p. syringae by choline over glycine betaine  when these compounds were provided at high concentrations (>100 microm). these results suggest that p. syringae has evolved to survive in relatively choline-rich habitats, a prediction that is supported by the common association of p. syringae with plants and the widespread production of choline, but genus- and species-specific production of glycine betaine, by plants. among the three putative bcct family transporters in pseudomonas aeruginosa and six in pseudomonas putida, different transporters were predicted to function based on similarity to escherichia coli bett than to p. syringae bett. functional p. putida and p. aeruginosa transporters were identified, and their possession of a  long c-terminal tail suggested an osmoregulatory function for this tail; this function was confirmed for p. syringae bett using deletion derivatives.

AB  == gdsl-type lipase is a hydrolytic enzyme whose amino acid sequence contains a pentapeptide motif (gly-x-ser-x-gly) with active serine (ser). pepper gdsl-type lipase (caglip1) gene was isolated and functionally characterized from pepper leaf tissues infected by xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria (xcv). the caglip1 protein was located in the vascular tissues of arabidopsis root. the caglip1 gene was preferentially expressed in pepper leaves during the compatible  interaction with xcv. treatment with salicylic acid, ethylene and methyl jasmonate induced caglip1 gene expression in pepper leaves. sodium nitroprusside, methyl viologen, high salt, mannitol-mediated dehydration and wounding also induced early and transient caglip1 expression in pepper leaf tissues. virus-induced gene silencing of caglip1 in pepper conferred enhanced resistance to xcv, accompanied by the suppressed expression of basic pr1 (cabpr1) and defensin (cadef1) genes. the caglip1 lipase produced in escherichia coli hydrolyzed the substrates of short and long chain nitrophenyl esters. the caglip1-overexpressing arabidopsis exhibited enhanced hydrolytic activity toward  short and long chain nitrophenyl ester, as well as enhanced susceptibility to the bacterial pathogen pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato and the biotrophic oomycete hyaloperonospora parasitica. sa-induced expression of atpr1 and atgst1, also was  delayed in caglip1-overexpressing plants by sa application. during seed germination and plant growth, the caglip1 transgenic plants showed drought tolerance and differential expression of drought- and abscisic acid (aba)-inducible genes atrd29a, atadh and atrab18. aba treatment differentially regulated seed germination and gene expression in wild-type and caglip1 transgenic arabidopsis. overexpression of caglip1 also regulated glucose- and oxidative stress signaling. together, these results indicate that caglip1 modulates disease susceptibility and abiotic stress tolerance.

TI  == functional characterization of bacterial oligosaccharyltransferases involved in o-linked protein glycosylation.
AB  == protein glycosylation is an important posttranslational modification that occurs  in all domains of life. pilins, the structural components of type iv pili, are o  glycosylated in neisseria meningitidis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and some strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa. in this work, we characterized the p. aeruginosa 1244  and n. meningitidis mc58 o glycosylation systems in escherichia coli. in both cases, sugars are transferred en bloc by an oligosaccharyltransferase (otase) named pgll in n. meningitidis and pilo in p. aeruginosa. we show that, like pilo, pgll has relaxed glycan specificity. both otases are sufficient for glycosylation, but they require translocation of the undecaprenol-pyrophosphate-linked oligosaccharide substrates into the periplasm for activity. whereas pilo activity is restricted to short oligosaccharides, pgll is able to transfer diverse oligo- and polysaccharides. this functional characterization supports the concept that despite their low sequence similarity, pilo and pgll belong to a new family of "o-otases" that transfer oligosaccharides from lipid carriers to hydroxylated amino acids in proteins. to date, such activity has not been identified for eukaryotes. to our knowledge, this is the first report describing recombinant o glycoproteins synthesized in e. coli.

TI  == pseudomonas syringae lytic transglycosylases coregulated with the type iii secretion system contribute to the translocation of effector proteins into plant  cells.
AB  == pseudomonas syringae translocates virulence effector proteins into plant cells via a type iii secretion system (t3ss) encoded by hrp (for hypersensitive response and pathogenicity) genes. three genes coregulated with the hrp t3ss system in p. syringae pv. tomato dc3000 have predicted lytic transglycosylase domains: pspto1378 (here designated hrph), pspto2678 (hopp1), and pspto852 (hopaj1). hrph is located between hrpr and avre1 in the hrp pathogenicity island  and is carried in the functional cluster of p. syringae pv. syringae 61 hrp genes cloned in cosmid phir11. strong expression of dc3000 hrph in escherichia coli inhibits bacterial growth unless the predicted catalytic glutamate at position 148 is mutated. translocation tests involving c-terminal fusions with a cya (bordetella pertussis adenylate cyclase) reporter indicate that hrph and hopp1, but not hopaj1, are t3ss substrates. pseudomonas fluorescens carrying a phir11 derivative lacking hrph is poorly able to translocate effector hopa1, and this deficiency can be restored by hopp1 and hopaj1, but not by hrph(e148a) or hrph(1-241). dc3000 mutants lacking hrph or hrph, hopp1, and hopaj1 combined are  variously reduced in effector translocation, elicitation of the hypersensitive response, and virulence. however, the mutants are not reduced in secretion of t3ss substrates in culture. when produced in wild-type dc3000, the hrph(e148a) and hrph(1-241) variants have a dominant-negative effect on the ability of dc3000 to elicit the hypersensitive response in nonhost tobacco and to grow and cause disease in host tomato. the three hrp-associated lytic transglycosylases in dc3000 appear to have overlapping functions in contributing to t3ss functions during infection.

AB  == the arac/xyls family of transcription factors, which include proteins that are involved in the regulation of diverse biological processes, has been of considerable interest recently and has been constantly expanding by means of in silico predictions and experimental analysis. in this work, using a hmm based on  the dna binding domain of 58 experimentally characterized proteins from the arac/xyls (a/x), 1974 a/x proteins were found in 149 out of 212 bacterial genomes. this domain was used as a template to generate a phylogenetic tree and as a tool to predict the putative regulatory role of the new members of this family based on their proximity to a particular functional cluster in the tree. based on this approach we assigned a functional regulatory role for 75% of the tfs dataset. of these, 33.7% regulate genes involved in carbon-source catabolism, 9.6% global metabolism, 8.3% nitrogen metabolism, 2.9% adaptation responses, 8.9% stress responses, and 11.7% virulence. the abundance of tfs involved in the regulation of metabolic processes indicates that bacteria have optimized their regulatory systems to control energy uptake. in contrast, the lower percentage of tfs required for stress, adaptation and virulence regulation reflects the specialization acquired by each subset of tfs associated with those processes. this approach would be useful in assigning regulatory roles to uncharacterized members of other transcriptional factor families and it might facilitate their experimental analysis.

AB  == the plant pathogen pseudomonas syringae may cope with osmotic stress on plants, in part, by importing osmoprotective compounds. in this study, we found that p. syringae pv. tomato strain dc3000 was distinct from most bacterial species in deriving greater osmoprotection from exogenous choline than from glycine betaine. this superior osmoprotection was correlated with a higher capacity for uptake of  choline than for uptake of glycine betaine. of four putative osmoregulatory abc transporters in dc3000, one, designated opuc, functioned as the primary or sole transporter for glycine betaine and as one of multiple transporters for choline under high osmolarity. surprisingly, the homolog of the well-characterized prou transporter from escherichia coli and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium did not function in osmoprotection. the p. syringae pv. tomato opuc transporter was more closely related to the bacillus subtilis and listeria monocytogenes opuc transporters than to known osmoprotectant transporters in gram-negative bacteria  based on sequence similarity and genetic arrangement. the p. syringae pv. tomato  opuc transporter had a high affinity for glycine betaine, a low affinity for choline, and a broad substrate specificity that included acetylcholine, carnitine, and proline betaine. tandem cystathionine-beta-synthase (cbs) domains  in the atp-binding component of opuc were required for transporter function. the  presence of these cbs domains was correlated with osmoregulatory function among the putative transporters examined in dc3000 and was found to be predictive of functional osmoregulatory transporters in other pseudomonads. these results provide the first functional evaluation of an osmoprotectant transporter in a pseudomonas species and demonstrate the usefulness of the cbs domains as predictors of osmoregulatory activity.

TI  == arabidopsis cytochrome p450 monooxygenase 71a13 catalyzes the conversion of indole-3-acetaldoxime in camalexin synthesis.
AB  == camalexin (3-thiazol-2-yl-indole) is an indole alkaloid phytoalexin produced by arabidopsis thaliana that is thought to be important for resistance to necrotrophic fungal pathogens, such as alternaria brassicicola and botrytis cinerea. it is produced from trp, which is converted to indole acetaldoxime (iaox) by the action of cytochrome p450 monooxygenases cyp79b2 and cyp79b3. the remaining biosynthetic steps are unknown except for the last step, which is conversion of dihydrocamalexic acid to camalexin by cyp71b15 (pad3). this article reports characterization of cyp71a13. plants carrying cyp71a13 mutations produce  greatly reduced amounts of camalexin after infection by pseudomonas syringae or a. brassicicola and are susceptible to a. brassicicola, as are pad3 and cyp79b2 cyp79b3 mutants. expression levels of cyp71a13 and pad3 are coregulated. cyp71a13 expressed in escherichia coli converted iaox to indole-3-acetonitrile (ian). expression of cyp79b2 and cyp71a13 in nicotiana benthamiana resulted in conversion of trp to ian. exogenously supplied ian restored camalexin production  in cyp71a13 mutant plants. together, these results lead to the conclusion that cyp71a13 catalyzes the conversion of iaox to ian in camalexin synthesis and provide further support for the role of camalexin in resistance to a. brassicicola.

TI  == molecular identification and characterization of the tomato flagellin receptor lefls2, an orthologue of arabidopsis fls2 exhibiting characteristically different perception specificities.
AB  == bacterial flagellin is known to stimulate host immune responses in mammals and plants. in arabidopsis thaliana, the receptor kinase fls2 mediates flagellin perception through physical interaction with a highly conserved epitope in the n-terminus of flagellin, represented by the peptide flg22 derived from pseudomonas syringae. the peptide flg22 is highly active as an elicitor in many plant species. in contrast, a shortened version of the same epitope derived from  escherichia coli, flg15(e coli), is highly active as an elicitor in tomato but not in a. thaliana or nicotiana benthamiana. here, we make use of these species-specific differences in flagellin perception abilities to identify lefls2 as the flagellin receptor in tomato. lefls2 is most closely related to atfls2, indicating that it may represent the flagellin receptor of tomato. expression of  the lefls2 gene in arabidopsis did not result in accumulation of its corresponding gene product, as indicated by experiments with lefls2-gfp fusions.  in contrast, expression of lefls2-gfp fusions in n. benthamiana, a species that,  like tomato, belongs to the solanaceae, was obviously functional. n. benthamiana  plants transiently expressing a lefls2-gfp fusion acquired responsiveness to flg15(e coli) to which they are normally unresponsive. thus, lefls2 encodes a functional, specific flagellin receptor, the first to be identified in a plant family other than the brassicaceae.

AB  == the copper-resistance proteins pcoc from escherichia coli and copc from pseudomonas syringae exhibit 67% sequence identity, but the chemistry reported for pcoc (peariso, k.; huffman, d. l.; penner-hahn, j. e.; o'halloran, t. v. j. am. chem. soc. 2003, 125, 342-343) was distinctly different from that reported for copc (zhang, l.; koay, m.; maher, m. j.; xiao, z.; wedd, a. g. j. am. chem. soc. 2006, 128, 5834-5850). the source of the inconsistency has been identified,  and his1 is confirmed as an unprecedented bidentate ligand in each protein. access to a bona fide wild-type pcoc protein allowed unequivocal observation of intermediates involved in intermolecular redox copper transfer reactions.

TI  == inactivation of viruses on surfaces by ultraviolet germicidal irradiation.
AB  == in many outbreaks caused by viruses, the transmission of the agents can occur through contaminated environmental surfaces. because of the increasing incidence  of viral infections, there is a need to evaluate novel engineering control methods for inactivation of viruses on surfaces. ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (uvgi) is considered a promising method to inactivate viruses. this study evaluated uvgi effectiveness for viruses on the surface of gelatin-based medium in a uv exposure chamber. the effects of uv dose, viral nucleic acid type  (single-stranded rna, ssrna; single-stranded dna, ssdna; double-stranded rna, dsrna; and double-stranded dna, dsdna), and relative humidity on the virus survival fraction were investigated. for 90% viral reduction, the uv dose was 1.32 to 3.20 mj/cm2 for ssrna, 2.50 to to 4.47 mj/cm2 for ssdna, 3.80 to 5.36 mj/cm2 for dsrna, and 7.70 to 8.13 mj/cm2 for dsdna. for all four tested viruses, the uv dose for 99% viral reduction was 2 times higher than those for 90% viral reduction. viruses on a surface with single-stranded nucleic acid (ssrna and ssdna) were more susceptible to uv inactivation than viruses with double-stranded nucleic acid (dsrna and dsdna). for the same viral reduction, the uv dose at 85%  relative humidity (rh) was higher than that at 55% rh. in summary, results showed that uvgi was an effective method for inactivation of viruses on surfaces.

TI  == exoribonuclease r in pseudomonas syringae is essential for growth at low temperature and plays a novel role in the 3' end processing of 16 and 5 s ribosomal rna.
AB  == the (3'-->5') exoribonuclease rnase r interacts with the endoribonuclease rnase e in the degradosome of the cold-adapted bacterium pseudomonas syringae lz4w. we now present evidence that the rnase r is essential for growth of the organism at  low temperature (4 degrees c). mutants of p. syringae with inactivated rnr gene (encoding rnase r) are cold-sensitive and die upon incubation at 4 degrees c, a phenotype that can be complemented by expressing rnase r in trans. overexpressing polyribonucleotide phosphorylase in the rnr mutant does not rescue the cold sensitivity. this is different from the situation in escherichia coli, where rnr  mutants show normal growth, but pnp (encoding polyribonucleotide phosphorylase) and rnr double mutants are nonviable. interestingly, rnase r is not cold-inducible in p. syringae. remarkably, however, rnr mutants of p. syringae at low temperature (4 degrees c) accumulate 16 and 5 s ribosomal rna (rrna) that contain untrimmed extra ribonucleotide residues at the 3' ends. this suggests a novel role for rnase r in the rrna 3' end processing. unprocessed 16 s rrna accumulates in the polysome population, which correlates with the inefficient protein synthesis ability of mutant. an additional role of rnase r in the turnover of transfer-messenger rna was identified from our observation that the rnr mutant accumulates transfer-messenger rna fragments in the bacterium at 4 degrees c. taken together our results establish that the processive rnase r is crucial for rna metabolism at low temperature in the cold-adapted antarctic p. syringae.

TI  == overexpression of salicylic acid carboxyl methyltransferase reduces salicylic acid-mediated pathogen resistance in arabidopsis thaliana.
AB  == we cloned a salicylic acid/benzoic acid carboxyl methyltransferase gene, osbsmt1, from oryza sativa. a recombinant osbsmt1 protein obtained by expressing the gene  in escherichia coli exhibited carboxyl methyltransferase activity in reactions with salicylic acid (sa), benzoic acid (ba), and de-s-methyl benzo(1,2,3)thiadiazole-7-carbothioic acid (dsm-bth), producing methyl salicylate (mesa), methyl benzoate (meba), and methyl dsm-bth (mebth), respectively. compared to wild-type plants, transgenic arabidopsis overexpressing osbsmt1 accumulated considerably higher levels of mesa and meba, some of which were vaporized into the environment. upon infection with the bacterial pathogen pseudomonas syringae or the fungal pathogen golovinomyces orontii, transgenic plants failed to accumulate sa and its glucoside (sag), becoming more susceptible to disease than wild-type plants. osbsmt1-overexpressing arabidopsis showed little induction of pr-1 when treated with sa or g. orontii. notably, incubation  with the transgenic plant was sufficient to trigger pr-1 induction in neighboring wild-type plants. together, our results indicate that in the absence of sa, mesa  alone cannot induce a defense response, yet it serves as an airborne signal for plant-to-plant communication. we also found that jasmonic acid (ja) induced atbsmt1, which may contribute to an antagonistic effect on sa signaling pathways  by depleting the sa pool in plants.

TI  == the tobacco ntann12 gene, encoding an annexin, is induced upon rhodoccocus fascians infection and during leafy gall development.
AB  == summary annexins are calcium-binding proteins that have been associated in plants with different biological processes such as responses to abiotic stress and early nodulation stages. until now, the implication of annexins during plant-pathogen interactions has not been reported. here, a novel plant annexin gene induced in tobacco by-2 cell suspension cultures infected with the phytopathogenic bacterium rhodococcus fascians (strain d188) has been identified. expression of this gene,  called ntann12, is also induced, but to a lower extent, by a strain (d188-5) that is unable to induce leafy gall formation. this gene was also induced in by-2 cells infected with pseudomonas syringae but not in cells infected with agrobacterium tumefaciens or escherichia coli. ntann12 expression was also found  to be stimulated by abiotic stress, including nacl and abscissic acid, confirming a putative role in stress signal transduction pathways. in addition, promoter-gus analyses using homozygous transgenic tobacco seedlings showed that the developmentally controlled expression of ntann12 is altered upon r. fascians infection. finally, up-regulation of ntann12 during leafy gall ontogenesis was confirmed by rt-qpcr. discussion is focused on the potential role of ntann12 in biotic and abiotic stress responses and in plant development, both processes that may involve ca(2+)-dependent signalling.

TI  == functional characterization of the gene cluster from pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola nps3121 involved in synthesis of phaseolotoxin.
AB  == pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola is the causal agent of halo blight disease  of beans (phaseolus vulgaris l.), which is characterized by water-soaked lesions  surrounded by a chlorotic halo resulting from the action of a non-host-specific toxin known as phaseolotoxin. this phytotoxin inhibits the enzyme ornithine carbamoyltransferase involved in arginine biosynthesis. different evidence suggested that genes involved in phaseolotoxin production were clustered. two genes had been previously identified in our laboratory within this cluster: argk, which is involved in the immunity of the bacterium to its own toxin, and amta, which is involved in the synthesis of homoarginine. we sequenced the region around argk and amta in p. syringae pv. phaseolicola nps3121 to determine the limits of the putative phaseolotoxin gene cluster and to determine the transcriptional pattern of the genes comprising it. we report that the phaseolotoxin cluster (pht cluster) is composed of 23 genes and is flanked by insertion sequences and transposases. the mutation of 14 of the genes within the  cluster lead to a tox(-) phenotype for 11 of them, while three mutants exhibited  low levels of toxin production. the analysis of fusions of selected dna fragments to uida, northern probing, and reverse transcription-pcr indicate the presence of five transcriptional units, two monocistronic and three polycistronic; one is internal to a larger operon. the site for transcription initiation has been determined for each promoter, and the putative promoter regions were identified.  preliminary results also indicate that the gene product of phtl is involved in the regulation of the synthesis of phaseolotoxin.

TI  == the xaxab genes encoding a new apoptotic toxin from the insect pathogen xenorhabdus nematophila are present in plant and human pathogens.
AB  == xenorhabdus nematophila, a member of the enterobacteriaceae, kills many species of insects by strongly depressing the immune system and colonizing the entire body. a peptide cytotoxin has been purified from x. nematophila broth growth, and the cytolytic effect on insect immunocytes and hemolytic effect on mammalian red  blood cells of this toxin have been described (ribeiro, c., vignes, m., and brehelin, m. (2003) j. biol. chem. 278, 3030-3039). we show here that this toxin, xenorhabdus alpha-xenorhabdolysin (xax), triggers apoptosis in both insect and mammalian cells. we also report the cloning and sequencing of two genes, xaxab, encoding this toxin in x. nematophila. the expression of both genes in recombinant escherichia coli led to the production of active cytotoxin/hemolysin. however, hemolytic activity was observed only if the two peptides were added in the appropriate order. furthermore, we report here that inactivation of xaxab genes in x. nematophila abolished the major cytotoxic activity present in broth growth, called c1. we also show that these genes are present in various entomopathogenic bacteria of the genera xenorhabdus and photorhabdus, in pseudomonas entomophila, in the human pathogens yersinia enterocolitica and proteus mirabilis, and in the plant pathogen pseudomonas syringae. this toxin cannot be classified in any known family of cytotoxins on the basis of amino acid sequences, locus organization, and activity features. it is, therefore, probably  the prototype of a new family of binary toxins.

TI  == transcript stabilization by mrna sequences from hrpa of pseudomonas syringae.
AB  == production of heterologous proteins in bacteria is one of the main applications of biotechnology. although several high-efficiency expression systems have been developed, different steps in protein production may become rate-limiting depending on the production system and the protein being produced. one bottle neck can be the instability of the mrna. we have used fragments of the unusually  long-living mrna hrpa from the plant pathogenic bacteria pseudomonas syringae pathovars tomato and phaseolicola to increase the half-lives of heterologous transcripts. the stabilizing effect was extended to escherichia coli, as half-lives of several heterologous transcripts were increased from a few minutes  to up to 19min. production of heterologous proteins was also increased manifold by the addition of the stabilizing hrpa elements. we have mapped the regions of the hrpa transcript necessary and sufficient for the stabilization process.

TI  == autoinducer-2 of the fire blight pathogen erwinia amylovora and other plant-associated bacteria.
AB  == autoinducers are important for cellular communication of bacteria. the luxs gene  has a central role in the synthesis of autoinducer-2 (ai-2). the gene was identified in a shotgun library of erwinia amylovora and primers designed for pcr amplification from bacterial dna. supernatants of several erwinia amylovora strains were assayed for ai-2 activity with a vibrio harveyi mutant and were positive. many other plant-associated bacteria also showed ai-2 activity such as  erwinia pyrifoliae and erwinia tasmaniensis. the luxs genes of several bacteria were cloned, sequenced, and complemented escherichia coli strain dh5alpha and a salmonella typhimurium mutant, both defective in luxs, for synthesis of ai-2. assays to detect ai-2 activity in culture supernatants of several pseudomonas syringae pathovars failed, which may indicate the absence of ai-2 or synthesis of another type. several reporter strains did not detect synthesis of an acyl homoserine lactone (ahl, ai-1) by erwinia amylovora, but confirmed ahl-synthesis  for erwinia carotovora ssp. atroseptica and pantoea stewartii.

TI  == biofilm formation and cellulose expression among diverse environmental pseudomonas isolates.
AB  == the ability to form biofilms is seen as an increasingly important colonization strategy among both pathogenic and environmental bacteria. a survey of 185 plant-associated, phytopathogenic, soil and river pseudomonas isolates resulted in 76% producing biofilms at the air-liquid (a-l) interface after selection in static microcosms. considerable variation in biofilm phenotype was observed, including waxy aggregations, viscous and floccular masses, and physically cohesive biofilms with continuously varying strengths over 1500-fold. calcofluor  epifluorescent microscopy identified cellulose as the matrix component in biofilms produced by pseudomonas asplenii, pseudomonas corrugata, pseudomonas fluorescens, pseudomonas marginalis, pseudomonas putida, pseudomonas savastanoi and pseudomonas syringae isolates. cellulose expression and biofilm formation could be induced by the constitutively active wspr19 mutant of the cyclic-di-gmp-associated, ggdef domain-containing response regulator involved in  the p. fluorescens sbw25 wrinkly spreader phenotype and cellular aggregation in pseudomonas aeruginosa pa01. wspr19 could also induce p. putida kt2440, which otherwise did not produce a biofilm or express cellulose, as well as escherichia  coli k12 and salmonella typhimurium lt2, both of which express cellulose yet lack wspr homologues. statistical analysis of biofilm parameters suggest that biofilm  development is a more complex process than that simply described by the production of attachment and matrix components and bacterial growth. this complexity was also seen in multivariate analysis as a species-ecological habitat effect, underscoring the fact that in vitro biofilms are abstractions of those surface and volume colonization processes used by bacteria in their natural environments.

TI  == the algt gene of pseudomonas syringae pv. glycinea and new insights into the transcriptional organization of the algt-muc gene cluster.
AB  == the phytopathogenic bacterium pseudomonas syringae pv. glycinea infects soybean plants and causes bacterial blight. in addition to p. syringae, the human pathogen pseudomonas aeruginosa and the soil bacterium azotobacter vinelandii produce the exopolysaccharide alginate, a copolymer of d-mannuronic and l-guluronic acids. alginate production in p. syringae has been associated with increased fitness and virulence in planta. alginate biosynthesis is tightly controlled by proteins encoded by the algt-muc regulatory gene cluster in p. aeruginosa and a. vinelandii. these genes encode the alternative sigma factor algt (sigma(22)), its anti-sigma factors muca and mucb, mucc, a protein with a controversial function that is absent in p. syringae, and mucd, a periplasmic serine protease and homolog of htra in escherichia coli. we compared an alginate-deficient algt mutant of p. syringae pv. glycinea with an alginate-producing derivative in which algt is intact. the alginate-producing derivative grew significantly slower in vitro growth but showed increased epiphytic fitness and better symptom development in planta. evaluation of expression levels for algt, muca, mucb, mucd, and algd, which encodes an alginate biosynthesis gene, showed that mucd transcription is not dependent on algt in p.  syringae in vitro. promoter mapping using primer extension experiments confirmed  this finding. results of reverse transcription-pcr demonstrated that algt, muca,  and mucb are cotranscribed as an operon in p. syringae. northern blot analysis revealed that mucd was expressed as a 1.75-kb monocistronic mrna in p. syringae.

TI  == plant stomata function in innate immunity against bacterial invasion.
AB  == microbial entry into host tissue is a critical first step in causing infection in animals and plants. in plants, it has been assumed that microscopic surface openings, such as stomata, serve as passive ports of bacterial entry during infection. surprisingly, we found that stomatal closure is part of a plant innate immune response to restrict bacterial invasion. stomatal guard cells of arabidopsis perceive bacterial surface molecules, which requires the fls2 receptor, production of nitric oxide, and the guard-cell-specific ost1 kinase. to circumvent this innate immune response, plant pathogenic bacteria have evolved specific virulence factors to effectively cause stomatal reopening as an important pathogenesis strategy. we provide evidence that supports a model in which stomata, as part of an integral innate immune system, act as a barrier against bacterial infection.

TI  == diversifying selection drives the evolution of the type iii secretion system pilus of pseudomonas syringae.
AB  == the plant pathogenic bacterium pseudomonas syringae uses a type iii secretion system to inject virulence proteins directly into the cytoplasm of its hosts. the p. syringae type iii secretion apparatus is encoded, in part, by the hrpz operon, which carries the hrpa gene encoding the pilin subunit of the pilus, various components of the structural apparatus, and the hrpz harpin protein that is believed to produce pores in the host cell membrane. the pilus of the type iii system comes into direct contact with the host cell and is, therefore, a likely target of the host's pathogen surveillance systems. we sequenced and analyzed 22  hrpz operons from p. syringae strains spanning the diversity of the species. selection analyses, including k(a)/k(s) tests and tajima's d, revealed strong diversifying selection acting on the hrpa gene. this form of selection enables pathogens to maintain genetic diversity within their populations and is often driven by selection imposed by host defense systems. the hrpz operon also revealed a single significant recombination event that dramatically changed the evolutionary relationships among p. syringae strains from 2 quite distinct phylogroups. this recombination event appears to have introduced genetic diversity into a clade of strains that may now be undergoing positive selection.  the identification of diversifying selection acting on the hrp pilus across the whole population sample and positive selection within one p. syringae lineage supports a trench warfare coevolutionary model between p. syringae and its plant  hosts.

TI  == formation of functional tat translocases from heterologous components.
AB  == background: the tat pathway transports folded proteins across the cytoplasmic membrane of bacteria and the thylakoid membrane of plants. in eschericha coli, tat transport requires the integral membrane proteins tata, tatb and tatc. in this study we have tested the ability of tat genes from the eubacterial species pseudomonas syringae, streptomyces coelicolor and aquifex aeolicus, to compensate for the absence of the cognate e. coli tat gene, and thus to form functional tat  translocases with e. coli tat components. results: all three subunits of the tat  system from the gram positive organism streptomyces coelicolor were able to form  heterologous translocases with substantive tat transport activity. however, only  the tata and tatb proteins of pseudomonas syringae were able to functionally interact with the e. coli tat system even though the two organisms are closely related. of the tat components from the phylogenetically distant hyperthermophillic bacterium aquifex aeolicus only the tata proteins showed any detectable level of heterologous functionality. the heterologously expressed tata proteins of s. coelicolor and a. aeolicus were found exclusively in the membrane  fraction. conclusion: our results show that of the three tat proteins, tata is most likely to show cross-species complementation. by contrast, tatb and tatc do  not always show cross-complementation, probably because they must recognise heterologous signal peptides. since heterologously-expressed s. coelicolor tata protein was functional and found only in the membrane fraction, it suggests that  soluble forms of streptomyces tata reported by others do not play a role in protein export.

AB  == the siderophore and virulence factor yersiniabactin is produced by pseudomonas syringae. yersiniabactin was originally detected by high-pressure liquid chromatography (hplc); commonly used pcr tests proved ineffective. yersiniabactin production in p. syringae correlated with the possession of irp1 located in a predicted yersiniabactin locus. three similarly divergent yersiniabactin locus groups were determined: the yersinia pestis group, the p. syringae group, and the photorhabdus luminescens group; yersiniabactin locus organization is similar in p. syringae and p. luminescens. in p. syringae pv. tomato dc3000, the locus has a high gc content (63.4% compared with 58.4% for the chromosome and 60.1% and 60.7% for adjacent regions) but it lacks high-pathogenicity-island features, such as the insertion in a trna locus, the integrase, and insertion sequence elements. in p. syringae pv. tomato dc3000 and pv. phaseolicola 1448a, the locus lies between  homologues of psyr_2284 and psyr_2285 of p. syringae pv. syringae b728a, which lacks the locus. among tested pseudomonads, a pcr test specific to two yersiniabactin locus groups detected a locus in genospecies 3, 7, and 8 of p. syringae, and dna hybridization within p. syringae also detected a locus in the pathovars phaseolicola and glycinea. the pcr and hplc methods enabled analysis of nonpathogenic escherichia coli. hplc-proven yersiniabactin-producing e. coli lacked modifications found in irp1 and irp2 in the human pathogen cft073, and it  is not clear whether cft073 produces yersiniabactin. the study provides clues about the evolution and dispersion of yersiniabactin genes. it describes methods  to detect and study yersiniabactin producers, even where genes have evolved.

AB  == pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato dc3000 (pst) is a virulent pathogen that causes disease on tomato and arabidopsis. the type iii secretion system (ttss) plays a key role in pathogenesis by translocating virulence effectors from the bacteria into the plant host cell, while the phytotoxin coronatine (cor) contributes to virulence and disease symptom development. recent studies suggest that both the ttss and cor are involved in the suppression of host basal defenses. however, little is known about the interplay between the host gene expression changes associated with basal defenses and the virulence activities of the ttss and cor during infection. in this study, we used the affymetrix full genome chip to determine the arabidopsis transcriptome associated with basal defense to pst dc3000 hrp mutants and the human pathogenic bacterium escherichia coli o157:h7. we then used pst dc3000 virulence mutants to characterize arabidopsis transcriptional responses to the action of hrp-regulated virulence factors (e.g.  ttss and cor) during bacterial infection. additionally, we used bacterial flic mutants to assess the role of the pathogen-associated molecular pattern flagellin in induction of basal defense-associated transcriptional responses. in total, our global gene expression analysis identified 2800 arabidopsis genes that are reproducibly regulated in response to bacterial pathogen inoculation. regulation  of these genes provides a molecular signature for arabidopsis basal defense to plant and human pathogenic bacteria, and illustrates both common and distinct global virulence effects of the ttss, cor, and possibly other hrp-regulated virulence factors during pst dc3000 infection.

AB  == the internalization and persistence of a bioluminescent escherichia coli o157:h7  ph1 was investigated in growing spinach plants that had been either biologically  or mechanically damaged. in control (undamaged) plants cultivated in soil microcosms inoculated with e. coli o157:h7 phl, the bacterium was recovered from  surface-sterilized root tissue but not from leaves. mechanical disruption of the  seminal root and root hairs of the plants did not result in the internalization of the pathogen into the aerial leaf tissue. when imprints of the root tissue were made on plates of tryptic soy agar plus ampicillin, no colonies of e. coli o157:h7 were observed around damaged tissue. the roots of growing plants were exposed to the northern root-knot nematode, meloidogyne hapla, in the presence of e. coli o157:h7. although this treatment caused knot formation on the roots, it did not enhance the internalization of the bacterium into the plant vascular system. coinoculation of intact leaves with e. coli o157:h7 and the phytopathogen pseudomonas syringae dc3000 resulted in localized necrosis, but the persistence of the human pathogen was not affected. the mechanical disruption of roots does not result in the internalization of e. coli o157:h7 into the aerial tissue of spinach, and there does not appear to be any effect of p. syringae in terms of enhancing the persistence of e. coli o157:h7 in spinach leaves.

TI  == characterization of a unique chromosomal copper resistance gene cluster from xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria.
AB  == we characterized the copper resistance genes in strain xvp26 of xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria, which was originally isolated from a pepper plant in  taiwan. the copper resistance genes were localized to a 7,652-bp region which, based on pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and southern hybridization, was determined to be located on the chromosome. these genes hybridized only weakly, as determined by southern analysis, to other copper resistance genes in xanthomonas and pseudomonas strains. we identified five open reading frames (orfs) whose products exhibited high levels of amino acid sequence identity to the products of previously reported copper genes. mutations in orf1, orf3, and orf4 removed copper resistance, whereas mutations in orf5 resulted in an intermediate copper resistance phenotype and insertions in orf2 had no effect on  resistance conferred to a copper-sensitive recipient in transconjugant tests. based on sequence analysis, orf1 was determined to have high levels of identity with the copr (66%) and pcor (63%) genes in pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato and escherichia coli, respectively. orf2 and orf5 had high levels of identity with the pcos gene in e. coli and the gene encoding a putative copper-containing oxidoreductase signal peptide protein in sinorhizobium meliloti, respectively. orf3 and orf4 exhibited 23% identity to the gene encoding a cation efflux system  membrane protein, czcc, and 62% identity to the gene encoding a putative copper-containing oxidoreductase protein, respectively. the latter two orfs were  determined to be induced following exposure to low concentrations of copper, while addition of co, cd, or zn resulted in no significant induction. pcr analysis of 51 pepper and 34 tomato copper-resistant x. campestris pv. vesicatoria strains collected from several regions in taiwan between 1987 and 2000 and nine copper-resistant strains from the united states and south america showed that successful amplification of dna was obtained only for strain xvp26. the organization of this set of copper resistance genes appears to be uncommon, and the set appears to occur rarely in x. campestris pv. vesicatoria.

TI  == analysis of arabidopsis growth factor gene 1 (gfg1) encoding a nudix hydrolase during oxidative signaling.
AB  == maintenance of pyridine nucleotide homeostasis is vital for normal growth and development of plants and animals. we demonstrate that arabidopsis growth factor  gene 1 (gfg1; at4g12720) encoding a nudix hydrolase, is an nadh pyrophosphatase and adp-ribose pyrophosphatase. the affinity for nadh and adp-ribose indicates that this enzyme could serve as a connection between sensing cellular redox changes and downstream signaling. gfg1 transcript levels were rapidly and transiently induced during both biotic stresses imposed by avirulent pathogens and abiotic stresses like ozone and osmoticum. t-dna knock out plants of gfg1 gene, gfg1-1, exhibit pleiotropic phenotypes such as reduced size, increased levels of reactive oxygen species and nadh, microscopic cell death, constitutive  expression of pathogenesis-related genes and enhanced resistance to bacterial pathogens. the recombinant protein failed to complement the mutator deficiency in sbmutt- strain of escherichia coli, suggesting this protein may not play a role in sanitizing the nucleotide pool. based on rapid transcriptional changes in response to various stresses, substrate specificity of the enzyme, and analysis of the knock out mutant, we propose that gfg1 is a key gene linking cellular metabolism and oxidative signaling.

TI  == identification of a twin-arginine translocation system in pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato dc3000 and its contribution to pathogenicity and fitness.
AB  == the bacterial plant pathogen pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato dc3000 (dc3000) causes disease in arabidopsis thaliana and tomato plants, and it elicits the hypersensitive response in nonhost plants such as nicotiana tabacum and nicotiana benthamiana. while these events chiefly depend upon the type iii protein secretion system and the effector proteins that this system translocates into plant cells, additional factors have been shown to contribute to dc3000 virulence and still many others are likely to exist. therefore, we explored the contribution of the twin-arginine translocation (tat) system to the physiology of dc3000. we found that a tatc mutant strain of dc3000 displayed a number of phenotypes, including loss of motility on soft agar plates, deficiency in siderophore synthesis and iron acquisition, sensitivity to copper, loss of extracellular phospholipase activity, and attenuated virulence in host plant leaves. in the latter case, we provide evidence that decreased virulence of tatc  mutants likely arises from a synergistic combination of (i) compromised fitness of bacteria in planta; (ii) decreased efficiency of type iii translocation; and (iii) cytoplasmically retained virulence factors. finally, we demonstrate a novel broad-host-range genetic reporter based on the green fluorescent protein for the  identification of tat-targeted secreted virulence factors that should be generally applicable to any gram-negative bacterium. collectively, our evidence supports the notion that virulence of dc3000 is a multifactorial process and that the tat system is an important virulence determinant of this phytopathogenic bacterium.

TI  == crystal structures of delta1-piperideine-2-carboxylate/delta1-pyrroline-2-carboxylate reductase belonging to a new family of nad(p)h-dependent oxidoreductases: conformational change, substrate recognition, and stereochemistry of the reaction.
AB  == delta(1)-piperideine-2-carboxylate/delta(1)-pyrroline-2-carboxylate reductase from pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato belongs to a novel sub-class in a large family of nad(p)h-dependent oxidoreductases distinct from the conventional mdh/ldh superfamily characterized by the rossmann fold. we have determined the structures of the following three forms of the enzyme: the unliganded form, the complex with nadph, and the complex with nadph and pyrrole-2-carboxylate at 1.55-, 1.8-, and 1.7-a resolutions, respectively. the enzyme exists as a dimer, and the subunit consists of three domains; domain i, domain ii (nadph binding domain), and domain iii. the core of the nadph binding domain consists of a seven-stranded predominantly antiparallel beta-sheet fold (which we named sesas)  that is characteristic of the new oxidoreductase family. the enzyme preference for nadph over nadh is explained by the cofactor binding site architecture. a comparison of the overall structures revealed that the mobile domains i and iii change their conformations to produce the catalytic form. this conformational change plays important roles in substrate recognition and the catalytic process.  the active site structure of the catalytic form made it possible to identify the  catalytic asp:ser:his triad and investigate the catalytic mechanism from a stereochemical point of view.

TI  == bacterial species specificity in prou osmoinducibility and nptii and lacz expression.
AB  == reporter gene-based transcriptional fusions are increasingly being used to address questions in microbial ecology, with constitutively expressed fusions enabling microbe tracking and inducible fusions reporting the presence of environmental signals. to more readily apply this technology to a variety of bacterial species, we examined species specificity in the expression of three promoters of interest. a comparison of two potentially constitutive promoters, each fused to the reporter gene gfp, showed that the nptii promoter (p(nptii)) was expressed in a broader range of species (100% of 11 tested) than the lacz promoter (p(lacz)) (75% of 11 tested), and thus has broader applicability for marking bacteria than p(lacz). for the species that expressed p(lacz), however,p(lacz) was expressed 3-fold more than p(nptii), on average. the escherichia coli prou promoter, which is induced by low water potential in e. coli, salmonella typhimurium, pantoea agglomerans, and pseudomonas syringae, was  shown to be similarly responsive to water potential in strains of clavibacter michiganensis, enterobacter aerogenes, pseudomonas fluorescens, pseudomonas putida, and sinorhizobium meliloti, as well as mildly osmoresponsive in agrobacterium tumefaciens, supporting its broad use as a reporter of water potential. surprisingly, this promoter was not regulated by water potential in strains of staphylococcus aureus and erwinia amylovora, illustrating heretofore unrecognized species specificity in prou inducibility, as well as potential limitations in the species that can serve as bioreporters of water potential.

TI  == characterization of a resistance-nodulation-cell division transporter system associated with the syr-syp genomic island of pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae.
AB  == a tripartite resistance-nodulation-cell division (rnd) transporter system, called the pseabc efflux system, was identified at the left border of the syr-syp genomic island of pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae strain b301d. the pseabc efflux system was located within a 5.7-kb operon that encodes an outer membrane protein (psea), a periplasmic membrane fusion protein (pseb), and an rnd-type cytoplasmic membrane protein (psec). the pseabc efflux system exhibited amino acid homology to a putative rnd efflux system of ralstonia solanacearum, with identities of 48% for psea, 51% for pseb, and 61% for psec. a nonpolar mutation within the psec gene was generated by nptii insertional mutagenesis. the resultant mutant strain showed a larger reduction in syringopeptin secretion (67%) than in syringomycin secretion (41%) compared to parental strain b301d (p < 0.05). a beta-glucuronidase assay with a psea::uida reporter construct indicated  that the gacs/gaca two-component system controls expression of the psea gene. quantitative real-time reverse transcription-pcr was used to determine transcript levels of the syringomycin (syrb1) and syringopeptin (sypa) synthetase genes in strain b301d-hk4 (a psec mutant). the expression of the sypa gene by mutant strain b301d-hk4 corresponded to approximately 13% of that by parental strain b301d, whereas the syrb1 gene expression by mutant strain b301d-hk4 was nearly 61% (p < 0.05). in addition, the virulence of mutant strain b301d-hk4 for immature cherry fruits was reduced by about 58% compared to parental strain b301d (p < 0.05). although the resistance of mutant strain b301d-hk4 to any antibiotic  used in this study was not reduced compared to parental strain b301d, a drug-supersensitive acrb mutant of escherichia coli showed two- to fourfold-increased resistance to acriflavine, erythromycin, and tetracycline upon heterologous expression of the psea, pseb, and psec genes (pseabc efflux genes).  the pseabc efflux system is the first rnd transporter system described for p. syringae, and it has an important role in secretion of syringomycin and syringopeptin.

TI  == colonization of the arabidopsis rhizosphere by fluorescent pseudomonas spp. activates a root-specific, ethylene-responsive pr-5 gene in the vascular bundle.
AB  == plants of which the roots are colonized by selected strains of non-pathogenic, fluorescent pseudomonas spp. develop an enhanced defensive capacity against a broad spectrum of foliar pathogens. in arabidopsis thaliana, this rhizobacteria-induced systemic resistance (isr) functions independently of salicylic acid but requires responsiveness to jasmonic acid and ethylene. in contrast to pathogen-induced systemic acquired resistance (sar), isr is not associated with systemic changes in the expression of genes encoding pathogenesis-related (pr) proteins. to identify genes that are specifically expressed in response to colonization of the roots by isr-inducing pseudomonas fluorescens wcs417r bacteria, we screened a collection of arabidopsis enhancer trap and gene trap lines containing a transposable element of the ac/ds system and the gus reporter gene. we identified an enhancer trap line (wet121) that specifically showed gus activity in the root vascular bundle upon colonization of the roots by wcs417r. fluorescent pseudomonas spp. strains p. fluorescens wcs374r and p. putida wcs358r triggered a similar expression pattern, whereas isr-non-inducing escherichia coli bacteria did not. exogenous application of the  ethylene precursor 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (acc) mimicked the rhizobacteria-induced gus expression pattern in the root vascular bundle, whereas methyl jasmonic acid and salicylic acid did not, indicating that the ds element in wet121 is inserted in the vicinity of an ethylene-responsive gene. analysis of the expression of the genes in the close vicinity of the ds element revealed attlp1 as the gene responsible for the in cis activation of the gus reporter gene in the root vascular bundle. attlp1 encodes a thaumatin-like protein that belongs to the pr-5 family of pr proteins, some of which possess antimicrobial properties. attlp1 knockout mutant plants showed normal levels of wcs417r-mediated isr against the bacterial leaf pathogen pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato dc3000, suggesting that expression of attlp1 in the roots is not required  for systemic expression of isr in the leaves. together, these results indicate that induction of attlp1 is a local response of arabidopsis roots to colonization by non-pathogenic fluorescent pseudomonas spp. and is unlikely to play a role in  systemic resistance.

TI  == recd plays an essential function during growth at low temperature in the antarctic bacterium pseudomonas syringae lz4w.
AB  == the antarctic psychrotrophic bacterium pseudomonas syringae lz4w has been used as a model system to identify genes that are required for growth at low temperature. transposon mutagenesis was carried out to isolate mutant(s) of the bacterium that are defective for growth at 4 degrees but normal at 22 degrees . in one such cold-sensitive mutant (cs1), the transposon-disrupted gene was identified to be a homolog of the recd gene of several bacteria. trans-complementation and freshly targeted gene disruption studies reconfirmed that the inactivation of the recd gene leads to a cold-sensitive phenotype. we cloned, sequenced, and analyzed approximately 11.2 kbp of dna from recd and its flanking region from the bacterium. recd was the last gene of a putative reccbd operon. the recd orf was 694 amino acids long and 40% identical (52% similar) to the escherichia coli protein, and it could complement the e. coli recd mutation. the recd gene of e. coli, however, could not complement the cold-sensitive phenotype of the cs1 mutant. interestingly, the cs1 strain showed greater sensitivity toward the dna-damaging agents, mitomycin c and uv. the inactivation of recd in p. syringae  also led to cell death and accumulation of dna fragments of approximately 25-30 kbp in size at low temperature (4 degrees ). we propose that during growth at a very low temperature the antarctic p. syringae is subjected to dna damage, which  requires direct participation of a unique recd function. additional results suggest that a truncated recd encoding the n-terminal segment of (1-576) amino acids is sufficient to support growth of p. syringae at low temperature.

TI  == characterization of copabcd operon from a copper-sensitive pseudomonas putida strain.
AB  == we describe an operon, copabcd, that encodes copper-binding and sequestering proteins for copper homeostasis in the copper-sensitive strain pseudomonas putida pnl-mk25. this is the second operon characterized as being involved in copper homeostasis, in addition to a p1-type atpase encoded by cuear, which was previously shown to be active in the same strain. in this study, 3 copper-responsive mutants were obtained through mini-tn5::gfp mutagenesis and were found to exhibit reduced tolerance to copper. sequencing analysis of the transposon-tagged region in the 3 mutants revealed insertions in 2 genes of an operon homologous to the copabcd of p. syringae and pcoabcd of escherichia coli.  gene expression studies demonstrated that the p. putida copabcd is inducible starting from 3 micromol/l copper levels. copper-sensitivity studies revealed that the tolerance of the mutant strains was reduced only marginally (only 0.16-fold) in comparison to a 6-fold reduced tolerance of the cuear mutant. thus, the cop operon in this strain has a minimal role when compared with its role both in other copper-resistant strains, such as p. syringae pv. syringae, and in the cuear operon of the same strain. we propose that the reduced function of the copabcd operon is likely to be due to the presence of fewer metal-binding domains in the encoded proteins.

TI  == crystal structure of the flagellar rotor protein flin from thermotoga maritima.
AB  == flin is a component of the bacterial flagellum that is present at levels of more  than 100 copies and forms the bulk of the c ring, a drum-shaped structure at the  inner end of the basal body. flin interacts with flig and flim to form the rotor-mounted switch complex that controls clockwise-counterclockwise switching of the motor. in addition to its functions in motor rotation and switching, flin  is thought to have a role in the export of proteins that form the exterior structures of the flagellum (the rod, hook, and filament). here, we describe the  crystal structure of most of the flin protein of thermotoga maritima. flin is a tightly intertwined dimer composed mostly of beta sheet. several well-conserved hydrophobic residues form a nonpolar patch on the surface of the molecule. a mutation in the hydrophobic patch affected both flagellar assembly and switching, showing that this surface feature is important for flin function. the association state of flin in solution was studied by analytical ultracentrifugation, which provided clues to the higher-level organization of the protein. t. maritima flin  is primarily a dimer in solution, and t. maritima flin and flim together form a stable flim(1)-flin(4) complex. escherichia coli flin forms a stable tetramer in  solution. the arrangement of flin subunits in the tetramer was modeled by reference to the crystal structure of tetrameric hrcqb(c), a related protein that functions in virulence factor secretion in pseudomonas syringae. the modeled tetramer is elongated, with approximate dimensions of 110 by 40 by 35 angstroms,  and it has a large hydrophobic cleft formed from the hydrophobic patches on the dimers. on the basis of the present data and available electron microscopic images, we propose a model for the organization of flin subunits in the c ring.

TI  == use of dominant-negative hrpa mutants to dissect hrp pilus assembly and type iii  secretion in pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato.
AB  == the hrp pilus plays an essential role in the long-distance type iii translocation of effector proteins from bacteria into plant cells. hrpa is the structural subunit of the hrp pilus in pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (pst) dc3000. little  is known about the molecular features in the hrpa protein for pilus assembly or for transporting effector proteins. from previous collections of nonfunctional hrpa derivatives that carry random pentapeptide insertions or single amino acid mutations, we identified several dominant-negative mutants that blocked the ability of wild-type pst dc3000 to elicit host responses. the dominant-negative phenotype was correlated with the disappearance of the hrp pilus in culture and inhibition of wild-type hrpa protein self-assembly in vitro. dominant-negative hrpa mutants can be grouped into two functional classes: one class exerted a strong dominant-negative effect on the secretion of effector proteins avrpto and  hopptom in culture, and the other did not. the two classes of mutant hrpa proteins carry pentapeptide insertions in discrete regions, which are interrupted by insertions without a dominant-negative effect. these results enable prediction of possible subunit-subunit interaction sites in the assembly of the hrp pilus and suggest the usefulness of dominant-negative mutants in dissection of the role of the wild-type hrpa protein in various stages of type iii translocation: protein exit across the bacterial cell wall, the assembly and/or stabilization of the hrp pilus in the extracellular space, and hrp pilus-mediated long-distance transport beyond the bacterial cell wall.

TI  == regulation of resistance to copper in xanthomonas axonopodis pv. vesicatoria.
AB  == copper-resistant strains of xanthomonas axonopodis pv. vesicatoria were previously shown to carry plasmid-borne copper resistance genes related to the cop and pco operons of pseudomonas syringae and escherichia coli, respectively. however, instead of the two-component (coprs and pcors) systems determining copper-inducible expression of the operons in p. syringae and e. coli, a novel open reading frame, copl, was found to be required for copper-inducible expression of the downstream multicopper oxidase copa in x. axonopodis. copl encodes a predicted protein product of 122 amino acids that is rich in histidine  and cysteine residues, suggesting a possible direct interaction with copper. deletions or frameshift mutations within copl, as well as an amino acid substitution generated at the putative start codon of copl, caused a loss of copper-inducible transcriptional activation of copa. a nonpolar insertion of a kanamycin resistance gene in copl resulted in copper sensitivity in the wild-type strain. however, repeated attempts to complement copl mutations in trans failed.  analysis of the genomic sequence databases shows that there are copl homologs upstream of copab genes in x. axonopodis pv. citri, x. campestris pv. campestris, and xylella fastidiosa. the cloned promoter area upstream of copa in x. axonopodis pv. vesicatoria did not function in pseudomonas syringae or in e. coli, nor did the p. syringae cop promoter function in xanthomonas. however, a transcriptional fusion of the xanthomonas cop promoter with the pseudomonas copabcdrs was able to confer resistance to copper in xanthomonas, showing divergence in the mechanisms of regulation of the resistance to copper in phytopathogenic bacteria.

TI  == type iii secretion chaperones of pseudomonas syringae protect effectors from lon-associated degradation.
AB  == the hrp type iii secretion system (ttss) of pseudomonas syringae translocates effector proteins into the cytoplasm of host cells. proteolysis of hrpr by lon has been shown to negatively regulate the hrp ttss. the inability to bypass lon-associated effects on the regulatory system by ectopic expression of the known regulators suggested a second site of action for lon in ttss-dependent effector secretion. in this study we report that ttss-dependent effectors are subject to the proteolytic degradation that appears to be rate-limiting to secretion. the half-lives of the effectors avrpto, avrrpt2, hoppsya, hoppsyb1, hopptob2, hoppsyv1, hopptog and hopptom were substantially higher in bacteria lacking lon. ttss-dependent secretion of several effectors was enhanced from lon  mutants. a primary role for chaperones appears to be protection of effectors from lon-associated degradation prior to secretion. when coexpressed with their cognate chaperone, hoppsyb1, hoppsyv1 and hopptom were at least 10 times more stable in strains expressing lon. distinct lon-targeting and chaperone-binding domains were identified in hopptom. the results imply that lon is involved at two distinct levels in the regulation of the p. syringae ttss: regulation of assembly of the secreton and modulation of effector secretion.

TI  == genetic elucidation of nitric oxide signaling in incompatible plant-pathogen interactions.
AB  == recent experiments indicate that nitric oxide (no) plays a pivotal role in disease resistance and several other physiological processes in plants. however,  most of the current information about the function of no in plants is based on pharmacological studies, and additional approaches are therefore required to ascertain the role of no as an important signaling molecule in plants. we have expressed a bacterial nitric oxide dioxygenase (nod) in arabidopsis plants and/or avirulent pseudomonas syringae pv tomato to study incompatible plant-pathogen interactions impaired in no signaling. nod expression in transgenic arabidopsis resulted in decreased no levels in planta and attenuated a pathogen-induced no burst. moreover, nod expression in plant cells had very similar effects on plant  defenses compared to nod expression in avirulent pseudomonas. the defense responses most affected by no reduction during the incompatible interaction were  decreased h(2)o(2) levels during the oxidative burst and a blockage of phe ammonia lyase expression, the key enzyme in the general phenylpropanoid pathway.  expression of the nod furthermore blocked uv light-induced phe ammonia lyase and  chalcone synthase gene expression, indicating a general signaling function of no  in the activation of the phenylpropanoid pathway. no possibly functions in incompatible plant-pathogen interactions by inhibiting the plant antioxidative machinery, and thereby ensuring locally prolonged h(2)o(2) levels. additionally,  albeit to a lesser extent, we observed decreases in salicylic acid production, a  diminished development of hypersensitive cell death, and a delay in pathogenesis-related protein 1 expression during these no-deficient plant-pathogen interactions. therefore, this genetic approach confirms that no is an important regulatory component in the signaling network of plant defense responses.

AB  == pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae strain ff5 is a phytopathogen associated with a rapid dieback on ornamental pear trees. p. syringae and the human pathogen pseudomonas aeruginosa produce the exopolysaccharide alginate, a copolymer of mannuronic and guluronic acid. in p. aeruginosa, the response regulator algr (algr1) is required for transcription of algc and algd, which encode key enzymes  in the alginate biosynthetic pathway. in p. syringae ff5, however, algr is not required for the activation of algd. interestingly, algr mutants of p. syringae remain nonmucoid, indicating an undefined role for this response regulator in alginate biosynthesis. in the current study, the algc promoter region was cloned  from p. syringae pv. syringae strain ff5, and sequence analysis of the algc promoter indicated the presence of potential binding sites for algr and sigma(54), the alternative sigma factor encoded by rpon. the algc promoter from p. syringae ff5 (psalgc) was cloned upstream of a promoterless glucuronidase gene (uida), and the psalgc-uida transcriptional fusion was used to monitor algc expression in strains ff5.32 (algr mutant of p. syringae ff5) and pg4180.k2 (rpon mutant of p. syringae pv. glycinea pg4180). expression of the psalgc-uida fusion  was fourfold lower in both the algr and rpon mutants as compared to respective wild-type strains, indicating that both algr and sigma(54) are required for full  activation of algc transcription in p. syringae pv. syringae. algr from p. syringae was successfully overproduced in escherichia coli as a c-terminal translational fusion to the maltose-binding protein (mbp). gel shift experiments  indicated that mbp-algr binds strongly to the algc promoter region. biological assays demonstrated that the algr mutant was significantly impaired in both pathogenicity and epiphytic fitness as compared to the wild-type strain. these results, along with the gene expression studies, indicate that algr has a positive role in the activation of algc in p. syringae and contributes to both virulence and epiphytic fitness. furthermore, the symptoms observed with wild-type p. syringae ff5 suggest that this strain can move systemically in leaf  tissue, and that a functional copy of algr is required for systemic movement.

TI  == the bacterial type iii secretion system-associated pilin hrpa has an unusually long mrna half-life.
AB  == secondary structures affect mrna stability and may play a role in protein secretion. we have studied the mrna of hrpa, which codes for the major structural unit of the type iii secretion system-associated pilus of pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato, erwinia carotovora and pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola. we show that hrpa mrna has an unusually long half-life, approximately 33-47 min. we mapped regions in the transcript that affected hrpa mrna accumulation. apparently, sequences at both 5' and 3' ends affect accumulation. altering the hypothetical, stable gc rich loop structure in the 3' end of the transcript decreased transcript levels.

AB  == a class 1 integron was detected in a single multidrug-resistant strain of enterotoxigenice escherichia coli (etec) o159 after examination of 23 clinical e. coli isolates. this isolate was resistant to streptomycin, kanamycin, gentamicin, chloramphenicol and ampicillin. sequencing of the class 1 integron identified three-gene cassettes. the first is the streptothricin acetyltransferase gene, sat, which confers resistance to streptothricin. the second is an orf whose product is a putative phosphoserine phosphatase (psp), and the last is an aminoglycoside adenyltransferase gene, aada2, which confers resistance to streptomycin and spectinomycin. the putative psp gene product was found to be 39%, 38%, 28%, and 27% identical to psp gene products of vibrio vulnificus cmcp6, v. vulnificus yj016, pseudomonas syringae, and p. aeruginosa, respectively. southern-blot hybridization showed that this integron is located on a 90 kb plasmid. this is the first report identifying a putative psp gene in an integron.

TI  == engineering plants with increased levels of the antioxidant chlorogenic acid.
AB  == the trend to view many foods not only as sustenance but also as medicine, so-called functional foods, is increasing. phenolics are the most widespread dietary antioxidants, and among these, chlorogenic acid (cga) accumulates to high levels in some crop plants. cga acts as an antioxidant in plants and protects against degenerative, age-related diseases in animals when supplied in their diet. cdna clones encoding the enzyme that synthesizes cga, hydroxycinnamoyl-coa  quinate: hydroxycinnamoyl transferase (hqt), were characterized from tomato and tobacco. gene silencing proved hqt to be the principal route for accumulation of  cga in solanaceous species. overexpression of hqt in tomato caused plants to accumulate higher levels of cga, with no side-effects on the levels of other soluble phenolics, and to show improved antioxidant capacity and resistance to infection by a bacterial pathogen. tomatoes with elevated cga levels could be used in foods with specific benefits for human health.

TI  == identification of a novel pseudomonas syringae psy61 effector with virulence and  avirulence functions by a hrpl-dependent promoter-trap assay.
AB  == the hrp pathogenicity island of pseudomonas syringae encodes a type iii secretion system (ttss) that translocates effectors into plant cells. most genes encoding effectors are dispersed in the p. syringae genome. regardless of location, all are regulated coordinately by the alternative sigma factor hrpl. an hrpl-dependent promoter-trap assay was developed to screen genomic libraries of p. syringae strains for promoters whose activity in escherichia coli is dependent on an inducible hrpl construct. twenty-two hrpl-dependent promoter fragments were isolated from p. syringae psy61 that included promoters for known hrpl-dependent  genes. one fragment also was isolated that shared no similarity with known genes  but retained a near consensus hrpl-dependent promoter. the sequence of the region revealed a 375-amino acid open reading frame encoding a 40.5-kda product that was designated hoppsyl. hoppsyl was structurally similar to other secreted effectors  and carried a putative chloroplast-targeting signal and two predicted transmembrane domains. hoppsyl':'avrrpt2 fusions were translocated into host cells via the p. syringae pv. tomato dc3000 hrp ttss. a hoppsyl::kan mutant of psy61 exhibited strongly reduced virulence in phaseolus vulgaris cv. kentucky wonder, but did not appear to act as a defense response suppressor. the ectopically expressed gene reduced the virulence of pseudomonas syringae dc3000 transformants in arabidopsis thaliana col-0. the gene was shown to be conserved in 6 of 10 p. syringae pv. syringae strains but was not detected in 35 strains of other pathovars. hoppsyl appears to be a novel ttss-dependent effector that functions as a host-species-specific virulence factor in psy61.

TI  == identification and characterization of a well-defined series of coronatine biosynthetic mutants of pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato dc3000.
AB  == to identify pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato genes involved in pathogenesis, we carried out a screen for tn5 mutants of p. syringae pv. tomato dc3000 with reduced virulence on arabidopsis thaliana. several mutants defining both known and novel virulence loci were identified. six mutants contained insertions in biosynthetic genes for the phytotoxin coronatine (cor). the p. syringae pv. tomato dc3000 cor genes are chromosomally encoded and are arranged in two separate clusters, which encode enzymes responsible for the synthesis of coronafacic acid (cfa) or coronamic acid (cma), the two defined intermediates in  cor biosynthesis. high-performance liquid chromatography fractionation and exogenous feeding studies confirmed that tn5 insertions in the cfa and cma genes  disrupt cfa and cma biosynthesis, respectively. all six cor biosynthetic mutants  were significantly impaired in their ability to multiply to high levels and to elicit disease symptoms on a. thaliana plants. to assess the relative contributions of cfa, cma, and cor in virulence, we constructed and characterized cfa6 cmaa double mutant strains. these exhibited virulence phenotypes on a. thalliana identical to those observed for the cmaa or cfa6 single mutants, suggesting that reduced virulence of these mutants on a. thaliana is caused by the absence of the intact cor toxin. this is the first study to use biochemically and genetically defined cor mutants to address the role of cor in pathogenesis.

TI  == importance of opghxcv of xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria in host-parasite  interactions.
AB  == tn5 insertion mutants of xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria were inoculated into tomato and screened for reduced virulence. one mutant exhibited reduced aggressiveness and attenuated growth in planta. southern blot analyses indicated  that the mutant carried a single tn5 insertion not associated with previously cloned pathogenicity-related genes of x. campestris pv. vesicatoria. the wild-type phenotype of this mutant was restored by one recombinant plasmid (popg361) selected from a genomic library of x. campestris pv. vesicatoria 91-118. tn3-gus insertion mutagenesis and sequence analyses of a subclone of popg361 identified a 1,929-bp open reading frame (orf) essential for complementation of the mutants. the predicted protein encoded by this orf was highly homologous to the previously reported pathogenicity-related hrpm protein of pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae and opgh of erwinia chrysanthemi. based on homology, the new locus was designated opghxcv. manipulation of the osmotic potential in the intercellular spaces of tomato leaves by addition of mannitol at low concentrations (25 to 50 mm) compensates for the opghxcv mutation.

TI  == evolutionary potential of an rna virus.
AB  == rna viruses are remarkably adaptable to changing environments. this is medically  important because it enables pathogenic viruses to escape the immune response and chemotherapy and is of considerable theoretical interest since it allows the investigation of evolutionary processes within convenient time scales. a number of earlier studies have addressed the dynamics of adapting rna virus populations. however, it has been difficult to monitor the trajectory of molecular changes in  rna genomes in response to selective pressures. to address the problem, we developed a novel in vitro evolution system based on a recombinant double-stranded rna bacteriophage, phi 6, containing a beta-lactamase (bla) gene  marker. carrier-state bacterial cells are resistant to ampicillin, and after several passages, they become resistant to high concentrations of another beta-lactam antibiotic, cefotaxime, due to mutations in the virus-borne bla gene. we monitored the changes in bla cdnas induced by cefotaxime selection and observed an initial explosion in sequence variants with multiple mutations throughout the gene. after four passages, a stable, homogeneous population of bla sequences containing three specific nonsynonymous mutations was established. of these, two mutations (e104k and g238s) have been previously reported for beta-lactamases from cefotaxime-resistant bacterial isolates. these results extend our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of viral adaptation and also demonstrate the possibility of using an rna virus as a vehicle for directed evolution of heterologous proteins.

TI  == the arabidopsis thaliana dihydroxyacetone phosphate reductase gene suppresssor of fatty acid desaturase deficiency1 is required for glycerolipid metabolism and for the activation of systemic acquired resistance.
AB  == systemic acquired resistance (sar) is a broad-spectrum resistance mechanism in plants that is activated in naive organs after exposure of another organ to a necrotizing pathogen. the organs manifesting sar exhibit an increase in levels of salicylic acid (sa) and expression of the pathogenesis-related1 (pr1) gene. sa signaling is required for the manifestation of sar. we demonstrate here that the  arabidopsis thaliana suppressor of fatty acid desaturase deficiency1 (sfd1) mutation compromises the sar-conferred enhanced resistance to pseudomonas syringae pv maculicola. in addition, the sfd1 mutation diminished the sar-associated accumulation of elevated levels of sa and pr1 gene transcript in the distal leaves of plants previously exposed to an avirulent pathogen. however, the basal resistance to virulent and avirulent strains of p. syringae and the accumulation of elevated levels of sa and pr1 gene transcript in the pathogen-inoculated leaves of sfd1 were not compromised. furthermore, the application of the sa functional analog benzothiadiazole enhanced disease resistance in the sfd1 mutant plants. sfd1 encodes a putative dihydroxyacetone phosphate (dhap) reductase, which complemented the glycerol-3-phosphate auxotrophy of the dhap reductase-deficient escherichia coli gpsa mutant. plastid  glycerolipid composition was altered in the sfd1 mutant plant, suggesting that sfd1 is involved in lipid metabolism and that an sfd1 product lipid(s) is important for the activation of sar.

TI  == the insecticidal toxin makes caterpillars floppy 2 (mcf2) shows similarity to hrma, an avirulence protein from a plant pathogen.
AB  == the photorhabdus luminescens w14 toxin encoding gene makes caterpillars floppy (mcf) was discovered due to its ability to kill caterpillars when expressed in escherichia coli. here we describe a homologue of mcf (renamed as mcf1), termed mcf2, discovered in the same genome. the mcf2 gene predicts another large toxin whose central domain, like mcf1, also shows limited homology to clostridium cytotoxin b. however, the n-terminus of mcf2 shows significant similarity to the  type-iii secreted effector hrma from the plant pathogen pseudomonas syringae and  no similarity to the n-terminus of mcf1. hrma is a plant avirulence gene whose transient expression in tobacco cells results in cell death. here we show that e. coli expressing mcf2 can, like e. coli expressing mcf1, kill insects. further, expression of the c-myc tagged n-terminus of mcf2, the region showing similarity  to hrma, results in nuclear localisation of the fusion protein and subsequent destruction of transfected mammalian cells. the mcf1 and mcf2 toxins therefore belong to a family of high molecular mass toxins, differing at their n-termini, which encode different effector domains.

TI  == characterization of cmaa, an adenylation-thiolation didomain enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of coronatine.
AB  == several pathovars of pseudomonas syringae produce the phytotoxin coronatine (cor), which contains an unusual amino acid, the 1-amino-2-ethylcyclopropane carboxylic acid called coronamic acid (cma), which is covalently linked to a polyketide-derived carboxylic acid, coronafacic acid, by an amide bond. the region of the cor biosynthetic gene cluster proposed to be responsible for cma biosynthesis was resequenced, and errors in previously deposited cmaa sequences were corrected. these efforts allowed overproduction of p. syringae pv. glycinea  pg4180 cmaa in p. syringae pv. syringae ff5 as a flag-tagged protein and overproduction of p. syringae pv. tomato cmaa in escherichia coli as a his-tagged protein; both proteins were in an enzymatically active form. sequence analysis of cmaa indicated that there were two domains, an adenylation domain (a domain) and  a thiolation domain (t domain). atp-(32)pp(i) exchange assays showed that the a domain of cmaa catalyzes the conversion of branched-chain l-amino acids and atp into the corresponding aminoacyl-amp derivatives, with a kinetic preference for l-allo-isoleucine. additional experiments demonstrated that the t domain of cmaa, which is posttranslationally modified with a 4'-phosphopantetheinyl group, reacts with the amp derivative of l-allo-isoleucine to produce an aminoacyl thiolester intermediate. this covalent species was detected by incubating cmaa with atp and  l-[g-(3)h]allo-isoleucine, followed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel  electrophoresis analysis. it is postulated that the l-allo-isoleucine covalently  tethered to cmaa serves as the substrate for additional enzymes in the cma biosynthetic pathway that catalyze cyclopropane ring formation, which is followed by thiolester hydrolysis, yielding free cma. the availability of catalytically active cmaa should facilitate elucidation of the details of the subsequent steps  in the formation of this novel cyclopropyl amino acid.

TI  == signals for local and systemic responses of plants to pathogen attack.
AB  == activation of plant defences following recognition of pathogen attack involves complex reiterative signal networks with extensive signal amplification and cross-talk. the results of two approaches that have been taken to analyse signalling in plant-microbe interactions are discussed here. activation tagging with t-dna harbouring multiple 35s enhancer elements was employed as a gain-of-function approach to dissect signalling related to bacterial pathogen resistance in arabidopsis thaliana. from a screen of approximately 5000 activation tagged lines, one line was identified as harbouring a t-dna leading to over-expression of an apoplastic aspartic protease (cdr-1), that resulted in resistance to normally virulent pseudomonas syringae. the second approach was to  screen for loss-of-function mutants in t-dna tagged populations. from a screen of 11 000 lines, one line, defective in induced resistance-1 (dir-1) lost resistance to normally avirulent p. syringae. models for action of the products of the cdr-1 and dir-1 genes suggest involvement of peptide and lipid signals in systemic disease resistance responses in a. thaliana.

TI  == differential survival of solitary and aggregated bacterial cells promotes aggregate formation on leaf surfaces.
AB  == the survival of individual pseudomonas syringae cells was determined on bean leaf surfaces maintained under humid conditions or periodically exposed to desiccation stress. cells of p. syringae strain b728a harboring a gfp marker gene were visualized by epifluorescence microscopy, either directly in situ or after recovery from leaves, and dead cells were identified as those that were stained with propidium iodide in such populations. under moist, conducive conditions on plants, the proportion of total live cells was always high, irrespective of their aggregated state. in contrast, the proportion of the total cells that remained alive on leaves that were periodically exposed to desiccation stress decreased through time and was only approximately 15% after 5 days. however, the fraction of cells in large aggregates that were alive on such plants in both condition was much higher than more solitary cells. immediately after inoculation, cells were randomly distributed over the leaf surface and no aggregates were observed. however, a very aggregated pattern of colonization was apparent within 7 days, and >90% of the living cells were located in aggregates of 100 cells or more. our results strongly suggest that, although conducive conditions favor aggregate formation, such cells are much more capable of tolerating environmental stresses, and the preferential survival of cells in aggregates promotes a highly clustered  spatial distribution of bacteria on leaf surfaces.

TI  == cleavage of the pseudomonas syringae type iii effector avrrpt2 requires a host factor(s) common among eukaryotes and is important for avrrpt2 localization in the host cell.
AB  == many phytopathogenic bacteria use a type iii secretion system to deliver type iii effector proteins into the host plant cell. the pseudomonas syringae type iii effector avrrpt2 is cleaved at a specific site when translocated into the host cell. in this study, we first demonstrate that the factor(s) required for avrrpt2 cleavage is present in extracts from animal and yeast cells, as well as plant cells. the cleavage factor in animal and plant cell extracts was heat labile but  relatively insensitive to protease inhibitors. second, mutational analysis of avrrpt2 was applied to identify features important for its cleavage. in addition  to two of the amino acid residues in the immediate vicinity of the cleavage site, a large part of the region c-terminal to the cleavage site was required when avrrpt2 was cleaved in animal cell extract. most of these features were also important when avrrpt2 was cleaved in plant cells. third, we investigated the effect of cleavage in interactions of avrrpt2 with plant cells. cleavage of avrrpt2 appeared to be important for proper interactions with arabidopsis cells that lack the resistance gene product corresponding to avrrpt2, rps2. in addition, removal of the region n-terminal to the cleavage site was important for the correct localization of the c-terminal effector region of the protein in the  host cell. we speculate that the virulence function of avrrpt2 requires removal of the n-terminal region to redirect the effector protein to a specific subcellular location in the host cell after translocation of the protein.

TI  == direct delivery of bacterial avirulence proteins into resistant arabidopsis protoplasts leads to hypersensitive cell death.
AB  == many bacterial avirulence (avr) proteins, including the pseudomonas syringae proteins, avrrpt2 and avrb, appear to be recognized inside the host plant cell by resistance mechanisms mediated by the cognate resistance (r) genes. it is thought that avr proteins are either delivered directly into the host cell via the bacterial type iii secretion system (ttss) or taken up by the plant cell following secretion into the apoplast through the ttss. recently, it was shown that the xanthomonas campestris avrbs2 protein can be delivered directly into the host plant cell by the ttss. however, it is not known whether other type iii effectors of phytopathogens behave similarly. here, using a novel protein transfection method, we demonstrate that avrrpt2 and avrb must enter the plant cell to be recognized by r gene-mediated mechanisms. first, we established a hypersensitive cell death assay for protoplasts using the membrane-impermeable, nuclear-staining dye, yo-pro-1, and transgenic arabidopsis plants that carry an inducible avrrpt2 gene. second, we transfected e. coli-produced avrrpt2 or avrb proteins into arabidopsis protoplasts using a protein transfection kit based on the carrier peptide pep-1, and demonstrated that hypersensitive cell death occurs in a gene-for-gene-specific manner. in contrast, these avr proteins failed to elicit hypersensitive cell death when they were applied to protoplasts without the carrier peptide. we conclude that our preparations of e. coli-produced avrrpt2 and avrb are active, that avrrpt2 and avrb must be delivered into the plant cell to be recognized, and that a method based on a carrier peptide can be  used to introduce proteins into plant cells.

AB  == involvement of the bacterial thiopurine methyltransferase (btpmt) in natural selenium methylation by freshwater was investigated. a freshwater environment that had no known selenium contamination but exhibited reproducible emission of dimethyl selenide (dmse) or dimethyl diselenide (dmdse) when it was supplemented  with an organic form of selenium [(methyl)selenocysteine] or an inorganic form of selenium (sodium selenite) was used. the distribution of the btpmt gene (tpm) in  the microflora was studied. freshwater bacteria growing on 10 micro m sodium selenite and 10 micro m sodium selenate were isolated, and 4.5 and 10% of the strains, respectively, were shown by colony blot hybridization to hybridize with  a pseudomonas syringae tpm dna probe. ribotyping showed that these strains are closely related. the complete rrs sequence of one of the strains, designated hsa.28, was obtained and analyzed. its closest phyletic neighbor was found to be  the pseudomonas anguilliseptica rrs sequence. the hsa.28 strain grown with sodium selenite or (methyl)selenocysteine produced significant amounts of dmse and dmdse. the hsa.28 tpm gene was isolated by genomic dna library screening and sequencing. blastp comparisons of the deduced hsa.28 btpmt sequence with p. syringae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, vibrio cholerae, rat, and human thiopurine methyltransferase sequences revealed that the levels of similarity were 52 to 71%. pcr-generated escherichia coli subclones containing the hsa.28 tpm open reading frame were constructed. e. coli cells harboring the constructs and grown  with sodium selenite or (methyl)selenocysteine produced significant levels of dmse and dmdse, confirming that the gene plays a role in selenium methylation. the effect of strain hsa.28 population levels on freshwater dmse and dmdse emission was investigated. an increase in the size of the hsa.28 population was found to enhance significantly the emission of methyl selenides by freshwater samples supplemented with sodium selenite or (methyl)selenocysteine. these data suggest that btpmt can play a role in natural freshwater selenium methylation processes.

TI  == novel exchangeable effector loci associated with the pseudomonas syringae hrp pathogenicity island: evidence for integron-like assembly from transposed gene cassettes.
AB  == pseudomonas syringae strains use a type iii secretion system (ttss) to translocate effector proteins that assist in the parasitism of host plant cells.  some genes for effector proteins are clustered in the exchangeable effector locus (eel) associated with the hrp pathogenicity island. a polymerase chain reaction-based screen was developed to amplify the eel from p. syringae strains.  of the 86 strains screened, the eel was successfully amplified from 30 predominately north american p. syringae pv. syringae strains using hrpk and quea-derived primers and from an additional three strains using hrpl and quea-derived primers. among the amplified eel, ten distinct types of eel were identified that could be classified into six families distinguishable by genetic  composition, but other types of eel may be present in strains isolated in other geographical regions. no linkage with the host range of the source strain was apparent. gene cassettes carrying conserved flanking, coding, and intergenic sequences, present in different combinations, were identified in the characterized eel. six new alleles of known effectors were identified that differed from the homolog in sequence, size, or both of the gene. one of these apparently novel effector proteins, hoppsyb, retained a strongly conserved amino  terminus similar to that of hoppsya, but other regions of the two polypeptides were only weakly similar. hoppsyb was expressed from an apparent operon that included hrpk and a shca homolog, shcb. escherichia coli mc4100 expressing the hrp ttss, shcb, and hoppsyb elicited the hypersensitive response (hr) in tobacco, consistent with effector production. indicative of translocation as an effector,  p. syringae pv. tomato dc3000 expressing a hoppsyb':'avrrpt2 fusion elicited the  hr in rps2+ arabidopsis thaliana. p. syringae pv. tomato dc3000 carrying hoppsyb  exhibited slightly enhanced virulence in several brassica spp. these results are  consistent with the hypotheses that the eel is a source of disparate effectors functioning in pathogenicity of p. syringae strains and that it evolved independently of the hrp pathogenicity island central conserved region, most likely through integron-like assembly of transposed gene cassettes.

TI  == ferredoxin from sweet pepper (capsicum annuum l.) intensifying harpin(pss)-mediated hypersensitive response shows an enhanced production of active oxygen species (aos).
AB  == the hypersensitive response (hr) is a form of cell death associated with plant resistance to pathogen infection. harpin(pss), an elicitor from the bacterium pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae, induces a hr in non-host plants. previously, we reported an amphipathic protein from sweet pepper interfering with harpin(pss)-mediated hr. in this report, we isolated and characterized a cdna clone encoded that amphipathic protein from sweet pepper. this protein is designated as pflp (plant ferredoxin-like protein) by virtue of its high homology with plant ferredoxin protein containing an n-terminal signal peptide responsible for chloroplast targeting and a putative 2fe-2s domain responsible for redox activity. recombinant pflp obtained from escherichia coli was able to significantly increase active oxygen species (aos) generation when mixed with harpin(pss) in tobacco suspension cells. it also showed enhanced hr when co-infiltrated with harpin(pss) in tobacco leaves. we used a transgenic tobacco suspension cells system that constitutively expresses the pflp gene driven by the camv 35s promoter to study the function of pflp in enhancing harpin(pss)-mediated hypersensitive cell death in vivo. in response to harpin(pss), suspension cells derived from pflp transgenic tobacco showed a significant increase both in the generation of aos and in cell death as compared to the wild type. aos inhibitors  diphenylene iodonium chloride (dpi) and lanthanum chlorate (lacl3) were used to study the involvement of aos in harpin(pss)-induced cell death. our results demonstrate enhanced generation of aos is necessary to cause enhanced hypersensitive cell death in pflp transgenic tobacco cells and it is plasma membrane-bound nadph-oxidase-dependent. sub-cellular localization studies showed  that pflp is present in the cytoplasm and chloroplast of pflp transgenic tobacco  cells, but only in the chloroplast, not in the cytoplasm, of wild-type tobacco cells. it is possible that pflp can change the redox state of the cell upon harpin(pss) inoculation to increase aos generation and hypersensitive cell death. overall, this study will provide a new insight in the functional properties of ferredoxin in hypersensitive cell death.

TI  == long-term reduction of cold hardiness following ingestion of ice-nucleating bacteria in the colorado potato beetle, leptinotarsa decemlineata.
AB  == we investigated the effect of ingestion of ice-nucleating bacteria on the supercooling capacity and cold hardiness of the colorado potato beetle (leptinotarsa decemlineata say), a freeze-intolerant species that overwinters as  adults in shallow, terrestrial burrows. ingestion of ice-nucleating bacteria (enterobacter agglomerans, pseudomonas fluorescens, pseudomonas putida, pseudomonas syringae), fed on slices of potato tuber, caused an abrupt decrease in supercooling capacity. no change occurred in the supercooling capacity of beetles fed escherichia coli, as this species lacks ice-nucleating activity. ingestion rates showed that tubers treated with different species were equally palatable. during diapause induction beetles evacuated food from their guts, but  nevertheless retained sufficient ice-nucleating bacteria to diminish supercooling. beetles fed p. fluorescens and p. putida exhibited reduced supercooling even after an 8-wk exposure to simulated winter conditions. furthermore, p. fluorescens was isolated 10-wk post-ingestion from diapausing beetles. our data suggest that ingested bacteria may be retained by insects during entry into diapause and that the cold hardiness of candidate crop pests, such as l. decemlineata, may be reduced by feeding them ice-nucleating bacteria prior to winter diapause.

TI  == the sypa, syps, and sypc synthetase genes encode twenty-two modules involved in the nonribosomal peptide synthesis of syringopeptin by pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae b301d.
AB  == syringopeptin is a necrosis-inducing phytotoxin, composed of 22 amino acids attached to a 3-hydroxy fatty acid tail. syringopeptin, produced by pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae, functions as a virulence determinant in the plant-pathogen interaction. a 73,800-bp dna region was sequenced, and analysis identified three  large open reading frames, sypa, sypb, and sypc, that are 16.1, 16.3, and 40.6 kb in size. sequence analysis of the putative sypa, sypb, and sypc sequences determined that they are homologous to peptide synthetases, containing five, five, and twelve amino acid activation modules, respectively. each module exhibited characteristic domains for condensation, aminoacyl adenylation, and thiolation. within the aminoacyl adenylation domain is a region responsible for substrate specificity. phylogenetic analysis of the substrate-binding pockets resulted in clustering of the 22 syringopeptin modules into nine groups. this clustering reflects the substrate amino acids predicted to be recognized by each  of the respective modules based on placement of the syringopeptin nrps (nonribosomal peptide synthetase) system in the linear (type a) group. finally, sypc contains two c-terminal thioesterase domains predicted to catalyze the release of syringopeptin from the synthetase and peptide cyclization to form the  lactone ring. the syringopeptin synthetases, which carry 22 nrps modules, represent the largest linear nrps system described for a prokaryote.

TI  == type iii protein translocase: hrcn is a peripheral atpase that is activated by oligomerization.
AB  == type iii protein secretion (tts) is catalyzed by translocases that span both membranes of gram-negative bacteria. a hydrophilic tts component homologous to f1/v1-atpases is ubiquitous and essential for secretion. we show that hrcn encodes the putative tts atpase of pseudomonas syringae pathovar phaseolicola and that hrcn is a peripheral protein that assembles in clusters at the membrane. a decahistidinyl hrcn derivative was overexpressed in escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity in a folded state. hydrodynamic analysis, cross-linking, and electron microscopy revealed four distinct hrcn forms: i, 48 kda (monomer); ii, approximately 300 kda (putative hexamer); iii, 575 kda (dodecamer); and iv, approximately 3.5 mda. form iii is the predominant form of hrcn at the membrane,  and its atpase activity is dramatically stimulated (>700-fold) over the basal activity of form i. we propose that tts atpases catalyze protein translocation as activated homo-oligomers at the plasma membrane.

TI  == the hrpx/hrpy two-component system activates hrps expression, the first step in the regulatory cascade controlling the hrp regulon in pantoea stewartii subsp. stewartii.
AB  == a regulatory cascade activating hrp/hrc type iii secretion and effector genes was delineated in pantoea stewartii subsp. stewartii, a bacterial pathogen of corn. four hrp regulatory genes were characterized: hrpx and hrpy encode the sensor kinase and response regulator, respectively, of a two-component signal transduction system; hrps encodes an ntrc-like transcriptional enhancer; and hrpl encodes an alternative sigma factor. epistasis analysis, expression studies using gene fusions, and genetic reconstruction of each step in escherichia coli were used to delineate the following pathway: hrpy activates hrps and also positively  autoregulates the hrpxy operon. in turn, hrps is required for full activation of  the sigma54-dependent hrpl promoter. finally, hrpl controls expression of all known hrp and wts genes. in vitro, hrps and all downstream hrp genes were regulated by ph and salt concentration. mutants with in-frame deletions in hrpx were still partially virulent on corn but were unable to sense the chemical or metabolic signals that induce hrp genes in vitro. site-directed mutagenesis of hrpy indicated that aspartate 57 is the probable phosphorylation site and that it is needed for activity. these findings suggest that both hrpx and an alternate mechanism are involved in the activation of hrpy in planta.

TI  == structure of the clade 1 catalase, catf of pseudomonas syringae, at 1.8 a resolution.
AB  == catalase catf of pseudomonas syringae has been identified phylogenetically as a clade 1 catalase, closely related to plant catalases, a group from which no structure has been determined. the structure of catf has been refined at 1.8 a resolution by using x-ray synchrotron data collected from a crystal flash-cooled  with liquid nitrogen. the crystallographic agreement factors r and r(free) are, respectively, 18.3% and 24.0%. the asymmetric unit of the crystal contains a whole molecule that shows accurate 222-point group symmetry. the crystallized enzyme is a homotetramer of subunits with 484 residues, some 26 residues shorter  than predicted from the dna sequence. mass spectrometry analysis confirmed the absence of 26 n-terminal residues, possibly removed by a periplasmic transport system. the core structure of the catf subunit was closely related to seven other catalases with root-mean-square deviations (rmsds) of 368 core calpha atoms of 0.99-1.30 a. the heme component of catf is heme b in the same orientation that is found in escherichia coli hydroperoxidase ii, an orientation that is flipped 180  degrees with respect the orientation of the heme in bovine liver catalase. nadph  is not found in the structure of catf because key residues required for nucleotide binding are missing; 2129 water molecules were refined into the model. water occupancy in the main or perpendicular channel of catf varied among the four subunits from two to five in the region between the heme and the conserved asp150. a comparison of the water occupancy in this region with the same region in other catalases reveals significant differences among the catalases.

AB  == the first cloning and characterization of the gene kata, encoding the major catalase (kata), from xanthomonas is reported. a reverse genetic approach using a synthesized kata-specific dna probe to screen a x. campestris pv. phaseoli genomic library was employed. a positively hybridizing clone designated pkat29 that contained a full-length kata was isolated. analysis of the nucleotide sequence revealed an open reading frame of 1,521 bp encoding a 507-amino acid protein with a theoretical molecular mass of 56 kda. the deduced amino acid sequence of kata revealed 84% and 78% identity to catf of pseudomonas syringae and katb of p. aeruginosa, respectively. phylogenetic analysis places xanthomonas kata in the clade i group of bacterial catalases. unexpectedly, expression of kata in a heterologous escherichia coli host resulted in a temperature-sensitive  expression. the kata enzyme was purified from an overproducing mutant of x. campestris and was characterized. it has apparent k(m) and v(max) values of 75 m  m [h(2)o(2)] and 2.55 x 10(5) micromol h(2)o(2) micromol heme(-1) s(-1), respectively. the enzyme is highly sensitive to 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole and nan(3), has a narrower optimal ph range than other catalases, and is more sensitive to heat inactivation.

TI  == construction and characterization of a prou-gfp transcriptional fusion that measures water availability in a microbial habitat.
AB  == we constructed and characterized a transcriptional fusion that measures the availability of water to a bacterial cell. this fusion between the prou promoter  from escherichia coli and the reporter gene gfp was introduced into strains of e. coli, pantoea agglomerans, and pseudomonas syringae. the prou-gfp fusion in these bacterial biosensor strains responded in a quantitative manner to water deprivation caused by the presence of nacl, na(2)so(4), kcl, or polyethylene glycol (molecular weight, 8000). the fusion was induced to a detectable level by  nacl concentrations of as low as 10 mm in all three bacterial species. water deprivation induced prou-gfp expression in both planktonic and surface-associated cells; however, it induced a higher level of expression in the surface-associated cells. following the introduction of p. agglomerans biosensor cells onto bean leaves, the cells detected a significant decrease in water availability within only 5 min. after 30 min, the populations were exposed, on average, to a water potential equivalent to that imposed by approximately 55 mm nacl. these results demonstrate the effectiveness of a prou-gfp-based biosensor for evaluating water  availability on leaves. furthermore, the inducibility of prou-gfp in multiple bacterial species illustrates the potential for tailoring prou-gfp-based biosensors to specific habitats.

TI  == lon protease functions as a negative regulator of type iii protein secretion in pseudomonas syringae.
AB  == the central conserved region of the pseudomonas syringae hrp pathogenicity island encodes a type iii protein secretion system (ttss) that is required for pathogenicity in plants. expression of the hrp ttss is controlled by the alternative sigma factor, hrpl, whose expression, in turn, is positively controlled by two truncated enhancer binding proteins, hrpr and hrps. although a  number of environmental conditions are known to modulate hrp ttss expression, such as stringent conditions and pathogenesis, the mechanism by which the activities of these transcriptional factors are modulated had not been established. in this study, hrpr and hrps were found to be constitutively expressed under conditions in which the hrpl promoter was inactive. to identify a postulated negative regulator of hrpl expression, transposome (tz) mutagenesis was used to isolate hrp constitutive mutants. p. syringae pss61 and dc3000 hrp constitutive mutants were identified that carried lon::tz insertions and exhibited increased cell length and uv sensitivity typical of delta lon mutants.  the p. syringae lon protease retained structural features of its homologues found in other bacteria and was capable of complementing an escherichia coli delta lon  mutant. p. syringae lon::tz mutants exhibited enhanced expression of the hrpl promoter, suggesting an effect on hrpr and/or hrps. hrpr was observed to be unstable in wild-type p. syringae strains grown in non-inductive media. however,  the apparent half-life increased more than 10-fold in the p. syringae lon::tz mutants or upon transfer to an inductive medium. the p. syringae lon mutants elicited rapidly developing plant responses and were shown to hypersecrete effector proteins, such as avrpto. these results indicate that expression of the  hrp regulon and type iii secretion are negatively regulated by lon-mediated degradation of hrpr.

TI  == genomewide identification of proteins secreted by the hrp type iii protein secretion system of pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato dc3000.
AB  == the ability of pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato dc3000 to be pathogenic on plants  depends on the hrp (hypersensitive response and pathogenicity) type iii protein secretion system and the effector proteins it translocates into plant cells. through iterative application of experimental and computational techniques, the dc3000 effector inventory has been substantially enlarged. five homologs of known avirulence (avr) proteins and five effector candidates, encoded by genes with putative hrp promoters and signatures of horizontal acquisition, were demonstrated to be secreted in culture and/or translocated into arabidopsis in a  hrp-dependent manner. these 10 hrp-dependent outer proteins (hops) were designated hopptoc (avrppic2 homolog), hopptod1 and hopptod2 (avrpphd homologs),  hopptok (avrrps4 homolog), hopptoj (avrxv3 homolog), hopptoe, hopptog, hopptoh, hopptoi, and hopptos1 (an adp-ribosyltransferase homolog). analysis of the enlarged collection of proteins traveling the hrp pathway in p. syringae revealed an export-associated pattern of equivalent solvent-exposed amino acids in the n-terminal five positions, a lack of asp or glu residues in the first 12 positions, and amphipathicity in the first 50 positions. these characteristics were used to search the unfinished dc3000 genome, yielding 32 additional candidate effector genes that predicted proteins with hrp export signals and that also possessed signatures of horizontal acquisition. among these were genes encoding additional adp-ribosyltransferases, a homolog of srfc (a candidate effector in salmonella enterica), a catalase, and a glucokinase. one adp-ribosyltransferase and the srfc homolog were tested and shown to be secreted  in a hrp-dependent manner. these proteins, designated hopptos2 and hopptol, respectively, bring the dc3000 hrp-secreted protein inventory to 22.

TI  == the hrp pilus of pseudomonas syringae elongates from its tip and acts as a conduit for translocation of the effector protein hrpz.
AB  == the type iii secretion system (ttss) is an essential requirement for the virulence of many gram-negative bacteria infecting plants, animals and man. pathogens use the ttss to deliver effector proteins from the bacterial cytoplasm  to the eukaryotic host cell, where the effectors subvert host defences. plant pathogens have to translocate their effector proteins through the plant cell wall barrier. the best candidates for directing effector protein traffic are bacterial appendages attached to the membrane-bound components of the ttss. we have investigated the protein secretion route in relation to the ttss appendage, termed the hrp pilus, of the plant pathogen pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato. by pulse expression of proteins combined with immunoelectron microscopy, we show that the hrp pilus elongates by the addition of hrpa pilin subunits at the distal end, and that the effector protein hrpz is secreted only from the pilus tip. our  results indicate that both hrpa and hrpz travel through the hrp pilus, which functions as a conduit for the long-distance translocation of effector proteins.

TI  == the matrix metalloproteinase gene gmmmp2 is activated in response to pathogenic infections in soybean.
AB  == matrix metalloproteinases (mmps) play an important role in host defense responses against pathogens in mammals where their activities lead to the production of antimicrobial peptides. we have identified a novel soybean (glycine max) metalloproteinase gene, gmmmp2, that is transcriptionally up-regulated in infected tissues. the deduced amino acid sequence indicates that this gene belongs to the mmp family. it is a preproprotein containing an n-terminal signal  peptide, a cysteine switch, a zinc-binding catalytic motif, and a c-terminal transmembrane domain. the gmmmp2 expressed in and purified from escherichia coli  exhibited an in vitro enzymatic activity in digesting myelin basic protein. all plant metalloproteinases reported so far have no known functions. however, they have been suggested to be involved in extracellular cell matrix degradation during development or senescence. our investigations demonstrate that the gmmmp2  transcript levels were rapidly increased in compatible and incompatible interactions of soybean tissues with the oomycete pathogen phytophthora sojae or  the bacterial pathogen pseudomonas syringae pv. glycinea. in agreement with the gmmmp2 activation, a metalloproteinase activity was gradually increased in suspension-cultured cells following the bacterial infection. gmmmp2 was also activated in response to wounding and dehydration. however, gmmmp2 activation did not correlate with the oxidative burst leading to the hypersensitive response cell death or the tissue senescence progress that involves programmed cell death. our investigations suggest that gmmmp2 may be involved in a novel defense response of soybean against pathogenic infections.

AB  == the abc transporter tlidef was found to be an efficient secretory apparatus for extracellular lipase tlia in pseudomonas fluorescens. for the enhanced secretion  of the lipase, we tried to coexpress tlia and tlidef in various pseudomonas species. whereas the coexpression of tlia and tlidef was required for the lipase  secretion in p. fragi, the expression of tlia was sufficient for the lipase secretion in p. fluorescens, p. syringae, and p. putida, indicating the existence of compatible abc transporter in these species. however, p. fluorescens harboring tlidefa secreted much more lipase than p. fluorescens harboring only tlia, but the tlidef was functional only at temperatures below 30 degrees c. the recombinant p. fluorescens overexpressing tlidefa showed the highest secretion level, 217 u/ml. od (optical density) (28 microg/ml. od) of lipase in luria-bertani medium under microaerated conditions. with the increase of aeration, the lipase production was decreased and the lipase seemed to be degraded as the cells entered the cell death phase. these results demonstrate that p. fluorescens can be used as a host system for the secretory production of  the lipase using the abc transporter, thus producing lipase in over 14% of the total protein.

TI  == a pathogen-inducible divinyl ether synthase (cyp74d) from elicitor-treated potato suspension cells.
AB  == in elicitor-treated potato cells, 9-lipoxygenase-derived oxylipins accumulate with the divinyl ether colneleic acid as the major metabolite. here, the identification of a potato cdna is described, whose predicted amino acid sequence corresponds to divinyl ether synthases, belonging to the recently identified new  p450 subfamily cyp74d. the recombinant protein was expressed in escherichia coli  and shown to metabolize 9-hydroperoxy linoleic acid to colneleic acid at ph 6.5.  this fatty acid derivative has been implicated in functioning as a plant antimicrobial compound. rna blot analyses revealed accumulation of divinyl ether  synthase transcripts both upon infiltration of potato leaves with pseudomonas syringae and after infection with phytophthora infestans.

TI  == dimethoxyphenol oxidase activity of different microbial blue multicopper proteins.
AB  == 2,6-dimethoxyphenol is a versatile substrate for pyricularia oryzae laccase, ppoa from marinomonas mediterranea, phenoxazinone synthase from streptomyces antibioticus and mammalian ceruloplasmin. in addition, in cellular extracts of microorganisms expressing other blue multicopper proteins with no enzymatic activity previously described, such as escherichia coli (copper resistance cueo), pseudomonas syringae and xanthomonas campestris (copper resistance copa), bacillus subtilis (sporulation protein cota) and saccharomyces cerevisiae (iron transporter fet3p), laccase activity is detected under appropriate conditions. this oxidase activity can be spectrophotometrically followed by the oxidation of  2,6-dimethoxyphenol. specific staining after sds-page is also possible for some of these proteins. this detection assay can facilitate the study of the multiple  functions that such proteins seem to carry out in a variety of microorganisms.

TI  == biological activity of harpin produced by pantoea stewartii subsp. stewartii.
AB  == pantoea stewartii subsp. stewartii causes stewart's wilt of sweet corn. a hypersensitive response and pathogenicity (hrp) secretion system is needed to produce water-soaking and wilting symptoms in corn and to cause a hypersensitive  response (hr) in tobacco. sequencing of the hrp cluster revealed a putative harpin gene, hrpn. the product of this gene was overexpressed in escherichia coli and shown to elicit the hr in tobacco and systemic resistance in radishes. the protein was designated hrpn(pnss). like other harpins, it was heat stable and protease sensitive, although it was three- to fourfold less active biologically than erwinia amylovora harpin. we used antibodies to purified hrpn(pnss) to verify that hrpn mutants could not produce harpin. this protein was secreted into the culture supernatant and was produced by strains of p. stewartii subsp. indologenes. in order to determine the importance of hrpn(pnss) in pathogenesis on sweet corn, three hrpn::tn5 mutants were compared with the wild-type strain with 50% effective dose, disease severity, response time, and growth rate in planta as parameters. in all tests, hrpn(pnss) was not required for infection, growth, or virulence in corn or endophytic growth in related grasses.

TI  == enhancer-binding proteins hrpr and hrps interact to regulate hrp-encoded type iii protein secretion in pseudomonas syringae strains.
AB  == in pseudomonas syringae strains, the hrp-hrc pathogenicity island consists of an  hrpl-dependent regulon that encodes a type iii protein translocation complex and  translocated effector proteins required for pathogenesis. hrpr and hrps function  as positive regulatory factors for the hrpl promoter, but their mechanism of action has not been established. both hrpr and hrps are structurally related to enhancer-binding proteins, but they lack receiver domains and do not appear to require a cognate protein kinase for activity. hrpr and hrps were shown to be expressed as an operon: a promoter was identified 5' to hrpr, and reverse transcriptase pcr detected the presence of an hrprs transcript. the hrpr promoter and coding sequence were conserved among p. syringae strains. the coding sequences for hrpr and hrps were cloned into compatible expression vectors, and their activities were monitored in escherichia coli transformants carrying an hrpl'-lacz fusion. hrps could function as a weak activator of the hrpl promoter,  but the activity was only 2.5% of the activity detected when both hrpr and hrps were expressed in the reporter strain. this finding is consistent with a requirement for both hrpr and hrps in the activation of the hrpl promoter. by using a yeast two-hybrid assay, an interaction between hrpr and hrps was detected, suggestive of the formation of a heteromeric complex. physical interaction of hrpr and hrps was confirmed by column-binding experiments. the results show that hrpr and hrps physically interact to regulate the sigma(54)-dependent hrpl promoter in p. syringae strains.

TI  == visualization of secreted hrp and avr proteins along the hrp pilus during type iii secretion in erwinia amylovora and pseudomonas syringae.
AB  == pili are required for protein and/or dna transfer from bacteria to recipient plant or bacterial cells, based on genetic evidence. however, it has never been shown directly that the effector proteins or dna are localized along or inside the pili in situ. failure to visualize an association of effector proteins/dna with pili is the central issue in the debate regarding the exact function of pili in protein and dna transfer. in this study, a newly developed in situ immunogold  labelling procedure enabled visualization of the specific localization of type iii effector proteins of erwinia amylovora and pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato along the hrp pilus, but not along the flagellum or randomly in the intercellular space. in contrast, pele, a pectate lyase secreted via the type ii protein secretion system, was not associated with the hrp pilus. these results provide direct evidence that type iii secretion occurs only at the site of hrp pilus assembly and that the hrp pilus guides the transfer of effector proteins outside  the bacterial cell, favouring the 'conduit/guiding filament' model.

TI  == effects of the two-component system comprising gaca and gacs of erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora on the production of global regulatory rsmb rna, extracellular enzymes, and harpinecc.
AB  == posttranscriptional regulation mediated by the regulator of secondary metabolites (rsm) rsma-rsmb pair is the most important factor in the expression of genes for  extracellular enzymes and harpinecc in erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora. rsma is a small rna-binding protein, which acts by lowering the half-life of a mrna species. rsmb specifies an untranslated regulatory rna and neutralizes the rsma effect. it has been speculated that gaca-gacs, members of a two-component system, may affect gene expression via rsma. because expa, a gaca homolog, and exps (or rpfa), a gacs homolog, have been identified in e. carotovora subsp. carotovora, we examined the effects of these gaca and gacs homologs on the expression of rsma, rsmb, and an assortment of exoprotein genes. the gaca gene of e. carotovora subsp. carotovora strain 71 stimulated transcription of genes for several extracellular enzymes (pel-1, a pectate lyase gene; peh-1, a polygalacturonase gene; and celv, a cellulase gene), hrpnecc (an e. carotovora subsp. carotovora gene specifying the elicitor of hypersensitive reaction), and rsmb in gaca+ and gacs+ e. carotovora subsp. carotovora strains. similarly, the e. carotovora subsp. carotovora gaca gene stimulated csrb (rsmb) transcription in escherichia coli. a gacs- mutant of e. carotovora subsp. carotovora strain ah2 and a gaca- mutant of e. carotovora subsp. carotovora strain ecc71 compared with their parent strains produced very low levels of rsmb, pel-1, peh-1, celv, and hrpnecc transcripts but produced similar levels of rsma rna and rsma protein as well as transcripts of hyperproduction of extracellular enzymes (hex) hexa, kdgr (repressor of genes for uronate and pectate catabolism), rsmc, and rpos (gene for sigma-s, an alternate sigma factor). the levels of rsmb, pel-1, peh-1, celv, and  hrpnecc transcripts as well as production of pectate lyase, polygalacturonase, cellulase, protease, and harpinecc proteins were stimulated in gacs- and gaca- mutants by gacs+ or gaca+ plasmids, respectively. the gaca effect on exoenzyme genes and hrpnecc was abrogated in e. carotovora subsp. carotovora mutants deficient in rsma and rsmc or rsma, rsmc, and rsmb rna. the expression of lacz transcriptional fusions of rsmb of erwinia amylovora and erwinia herbicola pv. gypsophilae was markedly reduced in a gaca- and a gacs- mutant of pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae. southern blot hybridization revealed the presence of gaca  and gacs homologs in all tested strains of soft-rotting erwinia spp. and several  nonsoft-rotting erwinia species such as e. amylovora, e. rhapontici, e. herbicola, e. stewartii, and e. herbicola pv. gypsophilae. these findings establish that the gaca-gacs system controls transcription of rsmb of e. carotovora subsp. carotovora, e. amylovora, and e. herbicola pv. gypsophilae and  support the hypothesis that the effects of this two-component system on extracellular protein production in e. carotovora subsp. carotovora is mediated,  at least in part, via the levels of rsmb transcripts.

TI  == study of the role of antimicrobial glucosinolate-derived isothiocyanates in resistance of arabidopsis to microbial pathogens.
AB  == crude aqueous extracts from arabidopsis leaves were subjected to chromatographic  separations, after which the different fractions were monitored for antimicrobial activity using the fungus neurospora crassa as a test organism. two major fractions were obtained that appeared to have the same abundance in leaves from untreated plants versus leaves from plants challenge inoculated with the fungus alternaria brassicicola. one of both major antimicrobial fractions was purified to homogeneity and identified by 1h nuclear magnetic resonance, gas chromatography/electron impact mass spectrometry, and gas chromatography/chemical ionization mass spectrometry as 4-methylsulphinylbutyl isothiocyanate (itc). this compound has previously been described as a product of myrosinase-mediated breakdown of glucoraphanin, the predominant glucosinolate in arabidopsis leaves.  4-methylsulphinylbutyl itc was found to be inhibitory to a wide range of fungi and bacteria, producing 50% growth inhibition in vitro at concentrations of 28 microm for the most sensitive organism tested (pseudomonas syringae). a previously identified glucosinolate biosynthesis mutant, gsm1-1, was found to be  largely deficient in either of the two major antimicrobial compounds, including 4-methylsulphinylbutyl itc. the resistance of gsm1-1 was compared with that of wild-type plants after challenge with the fungi a. brassicicola, plectosphaerella cucumerina, botrytis cinerea, fusarium oxysporum, or peronospora parasitica, or the bacteria erwinia carotovora or p. syringae. of the tested pathogens, only f.  oxysporum was found to be significantly more aggressive on gsm1-1 than on wild-type plants. taken together, our data suggest that glucosinolate-derived antimicrobial itcs can play a role in the protection of arabidopsis against particular pathogens.

TI  == construction and analysis of photolyase mutants of pseudomonas aeruginosa and pseudomonas syringae: contribution of photoreactivation, nucleotide excision repair, and mutagenic dna repair to cell survival and mutability following exposure to uv-b radiation.
AB  == based on nucleotide sequence homology with the escherichia coli photolyase gene (phr), the phr sequence of pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1 was identified from the genome sequence, amplified by pcr, cloned, and shown to complement a known phr mutation following expression in escherichia coli sy2. stable, insertional phr mutants containing a tetracycline resistance gene cassette were constructed in p. aeruginosa pao1 and p. syringae pv. syringae ff5 by homologous recombination and  sucrose-mediated counterselection. these mutants showed a decrease in survival compared to the wild type of as much as 19-fold after irradiation at uv-b doses of 1,000 to 1,550 j m(-2) followed by a recovery period under photoreactivating conditions. a phr uvra mutant of p. aeruginosa pao1 was markedly sensitive to uv-b irradiation exhibiting a decrease in survival of 6 orders of magnitude following a uv-b dose of 250 j m(-2). complementation of the phr mutations in p.  aeruginosa pao1 and p. syringae pv. syringae ff5 using the cloned phr gene from strain pao1 resulted in a restoration of survival following uv-b irradiation and  recovery under photoreactivating conditions. the uv-b survival of the phr mutants could also be complemented by the p. syringae mutagenic dna repair determinant rulab. assays for increases in the frequency of spontaneous rifampin-resistant mutants in uv-b-irradiated strains containing rulab indicated that significant uv-b mutability (up to a 51-fold increase compared to a nonirradiated control strain) occurred even in the wild-type pao1 background in which rulab only enhanced the uv-b survival by 2-fold under photoreactivating conditions. the frequency of occurrence of spontaneous nalidixic acid-resistant mutants in the pao1 uvra and uvra phr backgrounds complemented with rulab were 3.8 x 10(-5) and  2.1 x 10(-3), respectively, following a uv-b dose of 1,550 j m(-2). the construction and characterization of phr mutants in the present study will facilitate the determination of the roles of light and dark repair systems in organisms exposed to solar radiation in their natural habitats.

TI  == immunocytochemical localization of hrpa and hrpz supports a role for the hrp pilus in the transfer of effector proteins from pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato across the host plant cell wall.
AB  == the hrp pilus, composed of hrpa subunits, is an essential component of the type iii secretion system in pseudomonas syringae. we used electron microscopy (em) and immunocytochemistry to examine production of the pilus in vitro from p. syringae pv. tomato strain dc3000 grown under hrp-inducing conditions on em grids. pili, when labeled with antibodies to hrpa, developed rapidly in a nonpolar manner shortly after the detection of the hrpa transcript and extended up to 5 microm into surrounding media. structures at the base of the pilus were clearly differentiated from the basal bodies of flagella. the hrpz protein, also  secreted via the type iii system, was found by immunogold labeling to be associated with the pilus in vitro. accumulation and secretion of hrpa and hrpz were also examined quantitatively after the inoculation of wild-type dc3000 and hrpa and hrpz mutants into leaves of arabidopsis thaliana. the functional pilus crossed the plant cell wall to generate tracks of immunogold labeling for hrpa and hrpz. mutants that produced hrpa but did not assemble pili were nonpathogenic, did not secrete hrpa protein, and were compromised for the accumulation of hrpz. a model is proposed in which the rapidly elongating hrp pilus acts as a moving conveyor, facilitating transfer of effector proteins from  bacteria to the plant cytoplasm across the formidable barrier of the plant cell wall.

TI  == hexa of erwinia carotovora ssp. carotovora strain ecc71 negatively regulates production of rpos and rsmb rna, a global regulator of extracellular proteins, plant virulence and the quorum-sensing signal, n-(3-oxohexanoyl)-l-homoserine lactone.
AB  == the soft-rotting bacterium, erwinia carotovora ssp. carotovora (e. c. carotovora), produces an array of extracellular enzymes (= exoenzymes), including pectate lyase (pel), polygalacturonase (peh), cellulase (cel) and protease (prt), as well as harpinecc, the elicitor of hypersensitive reaction (hr). the production of these exoenzymes and harpinecc responds to plant products and the quorum-sensing signal [n-(3-oxohexanoyl)-l-homoserine lactone; ohl] and is subject to both transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation. hexa of e. c. carotovora strain ecc71 (hereafter hexa71), like that of another e. c. carotovora strain, negatively controls the production of exoenzymes, ohl and virulence in e. c. carotovora strain ecc71. in addition to exoenzymes, hexa71 negatively regulates the expression of hrpnecc, the structural gene for harpinecc. exoenzyme overproduction is abolished by ohl deficiency in a hexa- and ohll- double mutant, indicating that hexa and ohl are components of a common regulatory pathway controlling exoenzyme production. hexa71 negatively affects rpos, as the levels of this alternative sigma factor are higher in the hexa- mutant than in the hexa+ strain. however, a hexa- and rpos double mutant produces higher levels of exoenzymes and transcripts of pel-1, peh-1 and celvgenes than the hexa- and rpos+ parent. thus, the elevated levels of rpos protein in the hexa- mutant do not account for exoenzyme overproduction. the following evidence  associates for the first time the phenotypic changes in the hexa mutant to overproduction of rsmb rna, a global regulator of exoenzymes, harpinecc, ohl and  secondary metabolites. analyses of rsmb transcripts and expression of an rsmb-laczoperon fusion in e. c. carotovora strain ecc71 revealed that hexa71 negatively regulates transcription of rsmb. multiple copies of hexa71+ dna suppress various phenotypes, including exoenzyme production in e. c. carotovora strain ecc71, and concomitantly inhibit the production of rsmb, pel-1, peh-1, celv and hrpnecc transcripts. multiple copies of rsmb+ dna, on the other hand, stimulate exoenzyme production by relieving the negative effects of a chromosomal copy of hexa+. the occurrence of hexa homologues and the negative effect of the dosage of hexa71 dna on rsmb transcripts were also detected in other e. c. carotovora strains as well as erwinia carotovora atroseptica and erwinia carotovora betavasculorum. extrapolating from the findings with lrha, the escherichia coli homologue of hexa, and the presence of spre homologues in e. carotovora subspecies, we propose that hexa71 controls several regulatory pathways in e. carotovora including rsmb transcription and the production of spreecc which, in turn, affects rpos levels. a model is presented that integrates the findings presented here and our current knowledge of the major regulatory network that controls exoprotein production in soft-rotting erwinia carotovora subspecies.

AB  == two novel regulatory components, hrpx and hrpy, of the hrp system of erwinia amylovora were identified. the hrpxy operon is expressed in rich media, but its transcription is increased threefold by low ph, nutrient, and temperature levels--conditions that mimic the plant apoplast. hrpxy is autoregulated and directs the expression of hrpl; hrpl, in turn, activates transcription of other loci in the hrp gene cluster (z.-m. wei and s. v. beer, j. bacteriol. 177:6201-6210, 1995). the deduced amino -acid sequences of hrpx and hrpy are similar to bacterial two-component regulators including vsra/vsrd of pseudomonas  (ralstonia) solanacearum, degs/degu of bacillus subtilis, and uhpb/uhpa and narx/narp, narl of escherichia coli. the n-terminal signal-input domain of hrpx contains pas domain repeats. hrps, located downstream of hrpxy, encodes a protein with homology to wtsa (hrps) of erwinia (pantoea) stewartii, hrpr and hrps of pseudomonas syringae, and other delta54-dependent, enhancer-binding proteins. transcription of hrps also is induced under conditions that mimic the plant apoplast. however, hrps is not autoregulated, and its expression is not affected  by hrpxy. when hrps or hrpl were provided on multicopy plasmids, both hrpx and hrpy mutants recovered the ability to elicit the hypersensitive reaction in tobacco. this confirms that hrps and hrpl are not epistatic to hrpxy. a model of  the regulatory cascades leading to the induction of the e. amylovora type iii system is proposed.

AB  == hypersensitive response-assisting protein (hrap) is a novel plant protein that can intensify the harpinpss-mediated hypersensitive response (hr) in harpinpss-insensitive plants, such as the vegetative stage of sweet pepper. in this report, we identified a hrap cdna clone from sweet pepper (capsicum annuum cv. ecw). the sequence of this cdna clone showed no appreciable similarity to any other known sequences. however, it contained three positively charged regions, a  typical signal peptide and a camp-dependent phosphorylation site. the hrap mrna accumulated preferentially during the incompatible interaction of sweet pepper leaves with a pathogenic bacterium, pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae. when the hrap gene transcription level was high, the sweet pepper leaves readily expressed the harpinpss-mediated hr. the hrap gene transcription level in sweet pepper was  also higher during the reproductive stage than during the vegetative stage. the hrap distribution in an individual plant and different plant species was investigated. we found that all the organs of sweet pepper, except fruit, could express two different forms of hrap. moreover, the hrap gene was presented in many plant species including tobacco, arabidopsis, and rice. in conclusion, our results suggest that the hrap gene is widely distributed throughout the plant world and its transcription level correlates with plant sensitivity to harpinpss. the interaction between hrap and harpinpss reveals a novel way to interpret the interaction mechanism between plants and bacterial pathogens.

AB  == the effects of the rulab operon of pseudomonas syringae on mutagenic dna repair and the transcriptional regulation of rulab following irradiation with uv-b wavelengths were determined. for a rulb::km insertional mutant constructed in p.  syringae pv. syringae b86-17, sensitivity to uv-b irradiation increased and uv mutability decreased by 12- to 14-fold. rulab-induced uv mutability was also tracked in phyllosphere populations of b86-17 for up to 5 days following plant inoculation. uv mutability to rifampin resistance (rif(r)) was detected at all sampling points at levels which were significantly greater than in nonirradiated  controls. in p. aeruginosa pao1, the cloned rulab determinant on pjjk17 conferred a 30-fold increase in survival and a 200-fold increase in mutability following a  uv-b dose of 1,900 j m(-2). in comparative studies using defined genetic constructs, we determined that rulab restored mutability to the escherichia coli  umudc deletion mutant rw120 at a level between those of its homologs mucab and umudc. analyses using a rulab::inaz transcriptional fusion in pseudomonas fluorescens pf5 showed that rulab was rapidly induced after uv-b irradiation, with expression levels peaking at 4 h. at the highest uv-b dose administered, transcriptional activity of the rulab promoter was elevated as much as 261-fold compared to that of a nonirradiated control. the importance of rulab for survival of p. syringae in its phyllosphere habitat, coupled with its wide distribution among a broad range of p. syringae genotypes, suggests that this determinant would be appropriate for continued investigations into the ecological ramifications of mutagenic dna repair.

TI  == assembly and function of type iii secretory systems.
AB  == type iii secretion systems allow yersinia spp., salmonella spp., shigella spp., bordetella spp., and pseudomonas aeruginosa and enteropathogenic escherichia coli adhering at the surface of a eukaryotic cell to inject bacterial proteins across  the two bacterial membranes and the eukaryotic cell membrane to destroy or subvert the target cell. these systems consist of a secretion apparatus, made of  approximately 25 proteins, and an array of proteins released by this apparatus. some of these released proteins are "effectors," which are delivered into the cytosol of the target cell, whereas the others are "translocators," which help the effectors to cross the membrane of the eukaryotic cell. most of the effectors act on the cytoskeleton or on intracellular-signaling cascades. a protein injected by the enteropathogenic e. coli serves as a membrane receptor for the docking of the bacterium itself at the surface of the cell. type iii secretion systems also occur in plant pathogens where they are involved both in causing disease in susceptible hosts and in eliciting the so-called hypersensitive response in resistant or nonhost plants. they consist of 15-20 hrp proteins building a secretion apparatus and two groups of effectors: harpins and avirulence proteins. harpins are presumably secreted in the extracellular compartment, whereas avirulence proteins are thought to be targeted into plant cells. although a coherent picture is clearly emerging, basic questions remain to be answered. in particular, little is known about how the type iii apparatus fits together to deliver proteins in animal cells. it is even more mysterious for plant cells where a thick wall has to be crossed. in spite of these haunting questions, type iii secretion appears as a fascinating trans-kingdom communication device.

AB  == using a genetic screen we have identified two chromosomal genes, cusrs (ylca ybcz), from escherichia coli k-12 that encode a two-component, signal transduction system that is responsive to copper ions. this regulatory system is  required for copper-induced expression of pcoe, a plasmid-borne gene from the e.  coli copper resistance operon pco. the closest homologs of cusr and cuss are plasmid-borne two-component systems that are also involved in metal responsive gene regulation: pcor and pcos from the pco operon of e. coli; copr and cops from the cop operon, which provides copper resistance to pseudomonas syringae; and silr and sils from the sil locus, which provides silver ion resistance to salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium. the genes cusrs are also required for the copper-dependent expression of at least one chromosomal gene, designated cusc (ylcb), which is allelic to the recently identified virulence gene ibeb in e. coli k1. the cus locus may comprise a copper ion efflux system, because the expression of cusc is induced by high concentrations of copper ions. furthermore, the translation products of cusc and additional downstream genes are homologous to known metal ion antiporters.

TI  == characterization of rci-1, a chloroplastic rice lipoxygenase whose synthesis is induced by chemical plant resistance activators.
AB  == a full-length lipoxygenase cdna (rci-1) has been cloned from rice (oryza sativa)  whose corresponding transcripts accumulate in response to treatment of the plants with chemical inducers of acquired resistance such as benzo(1,2,3)thiadiazole-7-carbothioic acid s-methyl ester (bth), 2,6-dichloroisonicotinic acid (ina), and probenazole. in contrast, rci-1 transcript levels did not increase after inoculation with compatible and incompatible races of the rice blast fungus magnaporthe grisea and the nonhost pathogen pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae. rci-1 transcript levels also increased after exogenous application of jasmonic acid, but not upon wounding. dose-response and time course experiments revealed a similar pattern of transcript accumulation and lipoxygenase activity in bth-treated rice leaves. enzymatic analysis of recombinant rci-1 protein produced in escherichia coli revealed that 13-hydroperoxy-octadecanoic acids were the predominant reaction products when either linoleic or linolenic acid used as a substrate. the rci-1 sequence features a putative chloroplast targeting sequence at its n-terminus. indeed, a protein consisting of the putative chloroplast transit peptide fused to green fluorescent protein was exclusively localized in chloroplasts, indicating that rci-1 is a chloroplastic enzyme.

TI  == pseudomonas syringae hrp type iii secretion system and effector proteins.
AB  == pseudomonas syringae is a member of an important group of gram-negative bacterial pathogens of plants and animals that depend on a type iii secretion system to inject virulence effector proteins into host cells. in p. syringae, hrp/hrc genes encode the hrp (type iii secretion) system, and avirulence (avr) and hrp-dependent outer protein (hop) genes encode effector proteins. the hrp/hrc genes of p. syringae pv syringae 61, p. syringae pv syringae b728a, and p. syringae pv tomato dc3000 are flanked by an exchangeable effector locus and a conserved effector locus in a tripartite mosaic hrp pathogenicity island (pai) that is linked to a trna(leu) gene found also in pseudomonas aeruginosa but without linkage to hrp system genes. cosmid phir11 carries a portion of the strain 61 hrp pathogenicity island that is sufficient to direct escherichia coli  and pseudomonas fluorescens to inject hoppsya into tobacco cells, thereby eliciting a hypersensitive response normally triggered only by plant pathogens. large deletions in strain dc3000 revealed that the conserved effector locus is essential for pathogenicity but the exchangeable effector locus has only a minor  role in growth in tomato. p. syringae secretes hoppsya and avrpto in culture in a hrp-dependent manner at ph and temperature conditions associated with pathogenesis. avrpto is also secreted by yersinia enterocolitica. the secretion of avrpto depends on the first 15 codons, which are also sufficient to direct the secretion of an npt reporter from y. enterocolitica, indicating that a universal  targeting signal is recognized by the type iii secretion systems of both plant and animal pathogens.

AB  == we cloned the rpon (ntra and glnf) gene encoding sigma(54) from the phytopathogen pseudomonas syringae pv. maculicola strain es4326. the p. syringae es4326 rpon gene complemented pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, and klebsiella aerogenes rpon mutants for a variety of rpon mutant phenotypes, including the inability to utilize nitrate as sole nitrogen source. dna sequence analysis of the p. syringae es4326 rpon gene revealed that the deduced amino acid sequence was most similar (86% identity; 95% similarity) to the sigma(54) protein encoded  by the pseudomonas putida rpon gene. a marker exchange protocol was used to construct an es4326 rpon insertional mutation, rpon::km(r). in contrast to wild-type es4326, es4326 rpon::km(r) was nonmotile and could not utilize nitrate, urea, c(4)-dicarboxylic acids, several amino acids, or concentrations of ammonia  below 2 mm as nitrogen sources. rpon was essential for production of the phytotoxin coronatine and for expression of the structural genes encoding coronamic acid. in addition, es4326 rpon::km(r) did not multiply or elicit disease symptoms when infiltrated into arabidopsis thaliana leaves, did not elicit the accumulation of several arabidopsis defense-related mrnas, and did not elicit a hypersensitive response (hr) when infiltrated into tobacco (nicotiana tabacum) leaves. furthermore, whereas p. syringae es4326 carrying the avirulence  gene avrrpt2 elicited an hr when infiltrated into arabidopsis ecotype columbia leaves, es4326 rpon::km(r) carrying avrrpt2 elicited no response. constitutive expression of es4326 hrpl in es4326 rpon::km(r) partially restored defense-related mrna accumulation, showing a direct role for the hrp cluster in host defense gene induction in a compatible host-pathogen interaction. however, constitutive expression of hrpl in es4326 rpon::km(r) did not restore coronatine  production, showing that coronatine biosynthesis requires factors other than hrpl.

AB  == the host range of the gall-forming bacterium erwinia herbicola pv. gypsophilae (ehg) is restricted to gypsophila whereas erwinia herbicola pv. betae (ehb) attacks beet as well as gypsophila. both pathovars contain an indigenous plasmid  (ppath(ehg or ppath(ehb)) that harbors pathogenicity genes, including the hrp gene cluster. a cosmid library of ehg824-1 plasmid dna was mobilized into ehb4188 and the transconjugants were screened for pathogenicity on beet. one ehb transconjugant harboring the cosmid pla173 of ppatheb induced a hypersensitive-like response and abolished pathogenicity on beet. transposon mutagenesis of an open reading frame (orf) located on this cosmid eliminated its  affect on pathogenicity. marker exchange of this mutation into ehg824-1 caused a  substantial reduction in gall size on gypsophila and caused ehg824-1 to extend its host range and incite galls on beet. the orf (1.5 kb) was designated as pthg  (pathogenicity gene on gypsophila). dna sequence analysis of pthg revealed no significant homology to known genes in the data bank. only remnants of the pthg sequences were identified on the ppath of ehb4188. the deduced protein lacked an  n-terminal signal peptide but contained a short trans-membrane helix in its c terminus. the gene product, as determined by expression in escherichia coli and western blots (immunoblots), was a 56-kda protein.

TI  == mechanism of inactivation of ornithine transcarbamoylase by ndelta -(n'-sulfodiaminophosphinyl)-l-ornithine, a true transition state analogue? crystal structure and implications for catalytic mechanism.
AB  == the crystal structure is reported at 1.8 a resolution of escherichia coli ornithine transcarbamoylase in complex with the active derivative of phaseolotoxin from pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola, n(delta)-(n'-sulfodiaminophosphinyl)-l-ornithine. electron density reveals that the complex is not a covalent adduct as previously thought. kinetic data confirm  that n(delta)-(n'-sulfodiaminophosphinyl)-l-ornithine exhibits reversible inhibition with a half-life in the order of approximately 22 h and a dissociation constant of k(d) = 1.6 x 10(-12) m at 37 degrees c and ph 8.0. observed hydrogen  bonding about the chiral tetrahedral phosphorus of the inhibitor is consistent only with the presence of the r enantiomer. a strong interaction is also observed between arg(57) nepsilon and the p-n-s bridging nitrogen indicating that imino tautomers of n(delta)-(n'-sulfodiaminophosphinyl)-l-ornithine are present in the  bound state. an imino tautomer of n(delta)-(n'-sulfodiaminophosphinyl)-l-ornithine is structurally analogous to the proposed reaction transition state. hence, we propose that n(delta)-(n'-sulfodiaminophosphinyl)-l-ornithine, with its three unique n-p bonds, represents a true transition state analogue for ornithine transcarbamoylases, consistent with the tight binding kinetics observed.

TI  == the gene coding for the hrp pilus structural protein is required for type iii secretion of hrp and avr proteins in pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato.
AB  == bacterial surface appendages called pili often are associated with dna and/or protein transfer between cells. the exact function of pili in the transfer process is not understood and is a matter of considerable debate. the hrp pilus is assembled by the hrp type iii protein secretion system of pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (pst) strain dc3000. in this study, we show that the hrpa gene, which  encodes the major subunit of the hrp pilus, is required for secretion of putative virulence proteins, such as hrpw and avrpto. in addition, the hrpa gene is required for full expression of genes that encode regulatory, secretion, and effector proteins of the type iii secretion system. hrpa-mediated gene regulation apparently is through effect on the mrna level of two previously characterized regulatory genes, hrpr and hrps. ectopic expression of the hrprs gene operon restored gene expression, but not protein secretion, in the hrpa mutant. three single amino acid mutations at the hrpa carboxyl terminus were identified that affect the secretion or regulatory function of the hrpa protein. these results define an essential role of the hrp pilus structural gene in protein secretion and coordinate regulation of the type iii secretion system in pst dc3000.

TI  == arabidopsis pad3, a gene required for camalexin biosynthesis, encodes a putative  cytochrome p450 monooxygenase.
AB  == phytoalexins are low molecular weight antimicrobial compounds that are synthesized in response to pathogen attack. the phytoalexin camalexin, an indole  derivative, is produced by arabidopsis in response to infection with the bacterial pathogen pseudomonas syringae. the phytoalexin deficient 3 (pad3) mutation, which causes a defect in camalexin production, has no effect on resistance to p. syringae but compromises resistance to the fungal pathogen alternaria brassicicola. we have now isolated pad3 by map-based cloning. the predicted pad3 protein appears to be a cytochrome p450 monooxygenase, similar to  those from maize that catalyze synthesis of the indole-derived secondary metabolite 2,4-dihydroxy-1, 4-benzoxazin-3-one. the expression of pad3 is tightly correlated with camalexin synthesis and is regulated by pad4 and pad1. on the basis of these findings, we conclude that pad3 almost certainly encodes an enzyme required for camalexin biosynthesis. moreover, these results strongly support the idea that camalexin does not play a major role in plant resistance to p. syringae infection, although it is involved in resistance to a fungal pathogen.

TI  == reciprocal secretion of proteins by the bacterial type iii machines of plant and  animal pathogens suggests universal recognition of mrna targeting signals.
AB  == bacterial pathogens of both animals and plants use type iii secretion machines to inject virulence proteins into host cells. although many components of the secretion machinery are conserved among different bacterial species, the substrates for their type iii pathways are not. the yersinia type iii machinery recognizes some secretion substrates via a signal that is encoded within the first 15 codons of yop mrna. these signals can be altered by frameshift mutations without affecting secretion of the encoded polypeptides, suggesting a mechanism whereby translation of yop mrna is coupled to the translocation of newly synthesized polypeptide. we report that the type iii machinery of erwinia chrysanthemi cloned in escherichia coli recognizes the secretion signals of yope  and yopq. pseudomonas syringae avrb and avrpto, two proteins exported by the recombinant erwinia machine, can also be secreted by the yersinia type iii pathway. mapping avrpto sequences sufficient for the secretion of reporter fusions in yersinia revealed the presence of an mrna secretion signal. we propose that 11 conserved components of type iii secretion machines may recognize signals that couple mrna translation to polypeptide secretion.

AB  == we present here data showing that the avr proteins hrma and avrpto are secreted in culture via the native hrp pathways from pseudomonas syringae pathovars that produce these proteins. moreover, their secretion is strongly affected by the temperature and ph of the culture medium. both hrma and avrpto were secreted at their highest amounts when the temperature was between 18 and 22 degrees c and when the culture medium was ph 6.0. in contrast, temperature did not affect the secretion of hrpz. ph did affect hrpz secretion, but not as strongly as it affected the secretion of hrma. this finding suggests that there are at least two classes of proteins that travel the p. syringae pathway: putative secretion system accessory proteins, such as hrpz, which are readily secreted in culture; and effector proteins, such as hrma and avrpto, which apparently are delivered inside plant cells and are detected in lower amounts in culture supernatants under the appropriate conditions. because hrma was shown to be a hrp-secreted protein, we have changed the name of hrma to hoppsya to reflect that it encodes a hrp outer protein from p. syringae pv. syringae. the functional p. syringae hrp cluster encoded by cosmid phir11 conferred upon p. fluorescens but not escherichia coli the ability to secrete hoppsya in culture. the use of these optimized conditions should facilitate the identification of additional proteins  traveling the hrp pathway and the signals that regulate this protein traffic.

TI  == a bean cdna expressed during a hypersensitive reaction encodes a putative calcium-binding protein.
AB  == the hypersensitive reaction (hr) is an inducible plant response that is associated with disease resistance. it is characterized by rapid, localized cell  death at the site of infection and is believed to inhibit the spread of invading  pathogens. we have isolated a cdna clone, designated hra32 (for hypersensitive reaction associated), corresponding to an rna transcript that accumulates in bean during an hr. the predicted protein product of the hra32 cdna is an approximately 17 kda protein of 161 amino acids, with four putative ef-hand calcium-binding domains. the temporal pattern of hra32 transcript accumulation correlated closely with the onset of the hr in bean after inoculation with incompatible pseudomonas  syringae pv. tabaci and pv. tomato and with tobacco necrosis virus. hra32 transcript also accumulated in bean in response to compatible p. syringae pv. phaseolicola and was correlated with necrotic cell death associated with disease  lesion formation. a more transient pattern of hra32 transcript accumulation occurred in bean in response to general stimuli that did not result in the hr or  host cell death. these treatments included infiltration with a p. syringae pv. tabaci hrp- mutant, p. syringae pv. tabaci cells treated with kanamycin, escherichia coli, p. fluorescens, or glutathione, and in response to wounding. thus, there was differential accumulation of the hra32 transcript in response to  specific stimuli resulting in the hr, compared with general stimuli that did not  result in cell death. we hypothesize that the hra32 product may be a component of the pathway that leads to hypersensitive cell death.

AB  == pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato strain dc3000 (pst dc3000) expressing avrrpt2 is  specifically recognized by plant cells expressing rps2 activity, resulting in localized cell death and plant resistance. furthermore, transient expression of this bacterial avrrpt2 gene in plant cells results in rps2-dependent cell death.  this indicates that the avrrpt2 protein is recognized inside rps2 plant cells and is sufficient for the activation of disease resistance-mediated cell death in planta. we explored the possibility that pst dc3000 delivers avrrpt2 protein to plant cells via the hrp (type iii) secretion pathway. we now provide direct evidence that mature avrrpt2 protein is secreted from pst dc3000 and that secretion is hrp dependent. we also show that avrrpt2 is n-terminally processed when arabidopsis thaliana plants are infected with pst dc3000 expressing avrrpt2. similar n-terminal processing of avrrpt2 occurred when avrrpt2 was stably expressed in a. thaliana. no cleavage of avrrpt2 was detected in bacteria expressing avrrpt2 in culture or in the plant extracellular fluids. the n-terminus of avrrpt2 was not required for rps2 recognition in planta. however, this region of avrrpt2 was essential for pst dc3000-mediated elicitation of rps2-dependent cell death in a. thaliana leaves.

AB  == the virulence properties of many pathogenic bacteria are due to proteins encoded  by large gene clusters called pathogenicity islands, which are found in a variety of human pathogens including escherichia coli, salmonella, shigella, yersinia, helicobacter pylori, vibrio cholerae, and animal and plant pathogens such as dichelobacter nodosus and pseudomonas syringae. although the presence of pathogenicity islands is a prerequisite for many bacterial diseases, little is known about their origins or mechanism of transfer into the bacterium. the bacterial agent of epidemic cholera, vibrio cholerae, contains a bacteriophage known as cholera-toxin phage (ctxphi), which encodes the cholera toxin, and a large pathogenicity island called the vpi (for v. cholerae pathogenicity island)  which itself encodes a toxin-coregulated pilus that functions as a colonization factor and as a ctxphi receptor. we have now identified the vpi pathogenicity island as the genome of another filamentous bacteriophage, vpiphi. we show that vpiphi is transferred between v. cholerae strains and provide evidence that the tcpa subunit of the toxin-coregulated type iv pilus is in fact a coat protein of  vpiphi. our results are the first description of a phage that encodes a receptor  for another phage and of a virus-virus interaction that is necessary for bacterial pathogenicity.

TI  == kdgrecc negatively regulates genes for pectinases, cellulase, protease, harpinecc, and a global rna regulator in erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora.
AB  == erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora produces extracellular pectate lyase (pel),  polygalacturonase (peh), cellulase (cel), and protease (prt). the concerted actions of these enzymes largely determine the virulence of this plant-pathogenic bacterium. e. carotovora subsp. carotovora also produces harpinecc, the elicitor  of the hypersensitive reaction. we document here that kdgrecc (kdg, 2-keto-3-deoxygluconate; kdgr, general repressor of genes involved in pectin and  galacturonate catabolism), a homolog of the e. chrysanthemi repressor, kdgrech and the escherichia coli repressor, kdgreco, negatively controls not only the pectinases, pel and peh, but also cel, prt, and harpinecc production in e. carotovora subsp. carotovora. the levels of pel-1, peh-1, celv, and hrpnecc transcripts are markedly affected by kdgrecc. the kdgrecc- mutant is more virulent than the kdgrecc+ parent. thus, our data for the first time establish a  global regulatory role for kdgrecc in e. carotovora subsp. carotovora. another novel observation is the negative effect of kdgrecc on the transcription of rsmb  (previously aeph), which specifies an rna regulator controlling exoenzyme and harpinecc production. the levels of rsmb rna are higher in the kdgrecc- mutant than in the kdgrecc+ parent. moreover, by dnase i protection assays we determined that purified kdgrecc protected three 25-bp regions within the transcriptional unit of rsmb. alignment of the protected sequences revealed the 21-mer consensus  sequence of the kdgrecc-binding site as 5'-g/aa/ta/tgaaa[n6]tttcag/tg/ta-3'. two  such kdgrecc-binding sites occur in rsmb dna in a close proximity to each other within nucleotides +79 and +139 and the third kdgrecc-binding site within nucleotides +207 and +231. analysis of lacz transcriptional fusions shows that the kdgr-binding sites negatively affect the expression of rsmb. kdgrecc also binds the operator dnas of pel-1 and peh-1 genes and represses expression of a pel1-lacz and a peh1-lacz transcriptional fusions. we conclude that kdgrecc affects extracellular enzyme production by two ways: (i) directly, by inhibiting  the transcription of exoenzyme genes; and (ii) indirectly, by preventing the production of a global rna regulator. our findings support the idea that kdgrecc  affects transcription by promoter occlusion, i.e., preventing the initiation of transcription, and by a roadblock mechanism, i.e., by affecting the elongation of transcription.

TI  == replication regions from plant-pathogenic pseudomonas syringae plasmids are similar to cole2-related replicons.
AB  == many strains of the phytopathogen pseudomonas syringae contain mutually compatible plasmids that share extensive regions of sequence homology and essential replication determinants. the replication regions of two compatible large plasmids involved in virulence or pathogenicity, ppt23a from p. syringae pv. tomato strain pt23 and pav505 from p. syringae pv. phaseolicola strain hri1302a, were isolated. dna sequencing of the origins of replication revealed homologous orfs, designated orf-pto and orf-pph, respectively. both orfs are 1311 bp long and encode peptides of 437 amino acids with predicted molecular masses of 48259 (pto) and 48334 (pph) da. expression of the two orfs in escherichia coli produced peptides of 50 kda (pto) and 56 kda (pph). the predicted peptides showed an overall identity of 897 %, being highly conserved from residues 1 to 373, but  showing considerable variation in their c-terminal regions (50% identity over the last 64 aa). the two orfs had significant similarity with the putative replication protein from plasmid ptik12 of thiobacillus intermedius and other coie2-related plasmids. however, both peptides were 100 residues longer than any  of the known coie2-related rep sequences. subcloning of fragments from the replication region of ppt23a revealed the presence of at least three incompatibility determinants, designated inca, incb and incc. partial sequencing  of the region downstream of orf-pto revealed homology to the ru/ab genes, involved in uv resistance, from plasmid ppsr1. it is proposed that the replication origin of ppt23a serves as the prototype of a family of related plasmids.

AB  == thirty-two plasmid insertion mutants were independently isolated from two strains of xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris in taiwan. of the 32 mutants, 14 (44%),  8 (25%), and 4 (12%) mutants resulted from separate insertions of an is3 family member, is476, and two new insertion sequences (is), is1478 and is1479. while is1478 does not have significant sequence homology with any is elements in the embl/genbank/ddbj database, is1479 demonstrated 73% sequence homology with is1051 in x. campestris pv. dieffenbachiae, 62% homology with is52 in pseudomonas syringae pv. glycinea, and 60% homology with is5 in escherichia coli. based on the predicted transposase sequences as well as the terminal nucleotide sequences, is1478 by itself constitutes a new subfamily of the widespread is5 family, whereas is1479, along with is1051, is52, and is5, belongs to the is5 subfamily of the is5 family. all but one of the is476 insertions had duplications of 4 bp at the target sites without sequence preference and were randomly distributed. an is476 insertion carried a duplication of 952 bp at the target site. a model for generating these long direct repeats is proposed. insertions of is1478 and is1479, on the other hand, were not random, and is1478 and is1479 each showed conservation of pypuntta and pytapu sequences (py is a pyrimidine, pu is a purine, and n is any nucleotide) for duplications at the target sites. the results of southern blot hybridization analysis indicated that multiple copies of is476, is1478, and is1479 are present in the genomes of all seven x. campestris pv. campestris strains tested and several x. campestris pathovars.

TI  == thermoregulated expression and characterization of an nad(p)h-dependent 2-cyclohexen-1-one reductase in the plant pathogenic bacterium pseudomonas syringae pv. glycinea.
AB  == the phytopathogenic bacterium pseudomonas syringae pv. glycinea pg4180.n9 causes  bacterial blight of soybeans and preferably infects its host plant during periods of cold, humid weather conditions. to identify proteins differentially expressed  at low temperatures, total cellular protein fractions derived from pg4180.n9 grown at 18 and 28 degreesc were separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. of several proteins which appeared to be preferentially present  at 18 degreesc, a 40-kda protein with an isoelectric point of approximately 5 revealed significant n-terminal sequence homology to morphinone reductase (mr) of pseudomonas putida m10. the respective p. syringae gene was isolated from a genomic cosmid library of pg4180, and its nucleotide sequence was determined. it  was designated ncr for nad(p)h-dependent 2-cyclohexen-1-one reductase. comparison of the 1,083-bp open reading frame with database entries revealed 48% identity and 52% similarity to the mr-encoding morb gene of p. putida m10. the ncr gene was overexpressed in escherichia coli, and its gene product was used to generate  polyclonal antisera. purified recombinant ncr protein was enzymatically characterized with nad(p)h and various morphinone analogs as substrates. so far,  only 2-cyclohexen-1-one and 3-penten-2-one were found to be substrates for ncr. by high-pressure liquid chromatography analysis, flavin mononucleotide could be identified as the noncovalently bound prosthetic group of this enzyme. the distribution of the ncr gene in different pseudomonas species and various strains of p. syringae was analyzed by pcr and southern blot hybridization. the results indicated that the ncr gene is widespread among p. syringae pv. glycinea strains  but not in other pathovars of p. syringae or in any of the other pseudomonas strains tested.

TI  == insertion specificity and trans-activation of is801.
AB  == the transposable element is801, isolated from plasmid pmmc7105 of pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola, transposes in escherichia coli to plasmid targets, expressing a relatively relaxed target specificity. the target sequences are tetramers with homology with the left terminus (gaac) of the transposing unit, the alternative targets being gaac, ggac, caag, and cgac. in the areas flanking is801 in 13 different locations, no similarities other than the target tetramer were observed. the transposase is physically and functionally separable from the  transposing unit since transposition of constructs carrying marker genes occurs with the transposase expressed in trans. the is801 transposase shows amino acid sequence homology to the transposases of the e. coli elements is91 and is1294. these transposases contain conserved amino acid motifs found in the replicases of certain plasmids that replicate as rolling circles.

TI  == biosynthesis of the pseudomonas polyketide coronafacic acid requires monofunctional and multifunctional polyketide synthase proteins.
AB  == coronafacic acid (cfa) is the polyketide component of the phytotoxin coronatine,  a virulence factor of the plant pathogen pseudomonas syringae. our current knowledge of polyketide biosynthesis largely is based on the analysis of polyketide synthases (pkss) in actinomycetes and other gram-positive bacteria. consequently, the cloning and characterization of the cfa biosynthetic gene cluster will contribute significantly to our knowledge of polyketide synthesis in pseudomonas. in this report, we describe two genes in the cfa biosynthetic gene cluster that encode pkss that are structurally and functionally similar to the multifunctional modular pkss, which catalyze the synthesis of macrolide antibiotics. the cfa pks genes were overproduced in escherichia coli and shown to cross-react with antisera made to a modular pks involved in erythromycin synthesis. a scheme for cfa biosynthesis is presented that incorporates the activities of all proteins in the cfa pks. in this report a gene cluster encoding a pseudomonad polyketide has been completely sequenced and the deduced gene functions have been used to develop a biosynthetic scheme.

TI  == characterization of the syringomycin synthetase gene cluster. a link between prokaryotic and eukaryotic peptide synthetases.
AB  == with this work we have completed the characterization of the syringomycin synthetase gene cluster. in particular, by sequencing additional 28.5 kilobase pairs we show that the nine modules involved in the binding of the nine amino acids of syringomycin are localized on syrb and syre, with syre carrying eight modules. the recombinant syrb and the first and second modules of syre (syre1 and syre2) have been expressed in escherichia coli and purified. the biochemical data indicate that syrb binds threonine, the putative precursor of the last amino acid of syringomycin, whereas syre1 and syre2 bind serine, the first and the second amino acids of syringomycin, respectively. on the basis of the sequence analysis  and the biochemical data presented here, it appears that syringomycin synthetase  is unique among peptide synthetases in that its genetic organization does not respect the "colinearity rule" according to which the order of the amino acid binding modules along the chromosome parallels the order of the amino acids on the peptide. this feature, together with the absence of a single transcription unit and the absence of epimerase-like domains make syringomycin synthetase more  related to the eukaryotic peptide synthetases than to the bacterial counterparts.

TI  == initial binding of shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli to host cells and subsequent induction of actin rearrangements depend on filamentous espa-containing surface appendages.
AB  == shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli (stec) induce so-called attaching and effacing lesions that enable the tight adherence of these pathogens to the gut epithelium. all of the genes necessary for this process are present in the locus  of enterocyte effacement, which encodes a type iii secretion system, the secreted esp proteins and the surface protein intimin. in this study we sequenced the espa gene of stec, generated and characterized a corresponding deletion mutant and raised espa-specific monoclonal antibodies to analyse the functional role of this protein during infection. espa was detected in often filament-like structures decorating all bacteria that had attached to hela cells. these appendages were especially prominent on bacteria that had not yet induced the formation of actin  pedestals, indicating that they mediate the initial contact of stec to their target cells. consistently, a deletion of the espa gene completely abolished the  capacity of such stec mutants to bind to hela cells and to induce actin rearrangements. surface appendages similar to those described in this study are also formed by pseudomonas syringae and may represent a structural element common to many bacterial pathogens that deliver proteins into their target cells via a type iii secretion system.

AB  == plant-pathogenic bacteria produce various extracellular polysaccharides (epss) which may function as virulence factors in diseases caused by these bacteria. the eps levan is synthesized by the extracellular enzyme levansucrase in pseudomonas  syringae, erwinia amylovora, and other bacterial species. the lsc genes encoding  levansucrase from p. syringae pv. glycinea pg4180 and p. syringae pv. phaseolicola ncppb 1321 were cloned, and their nucleotide sequences were determined. heterologous expression of the lsc gene in escherichia coli was found in four and two genomic library clones of strains pg4180 and ncppb 1321, respectively. a 3. 0-kb psti fragment common to all six clones conferred levan synthesis on e. coli when further subcloned. nucleotide sequence analysis revealed a 1,248-bp open reading frame (orf) derived from pg4180 and a 1,296-bp orf derived from ncppb 1321, which were both designated lsc. both orfs showed high homology to the e. amylovora and zymomonas mobilis lsc genes at the nucleic  acid and deduced amino acid sequence levels. levansucrase was not secreted into the supernatant but was located in the periplasmic fraction of e. coli harboring  the lsc gene. expression of lsc was found to be dependent on the vector-based plac promoter, indicating that the native promoter of lsc was not functional in e. coli. insertion of an antibiotic resistance cassette in the lsc gene abolished levan synthesis in e. coli. a pcr screening with primers derived from lsc of p. syringae pv. glycinea pg4180 allowed the detection of this gene in a number of related bacteria.

TI  == a cloned erwinia chrysanthemi hrp (type iii protein secretion) system functions in escherichia coli to deliver pseudomonas syringae avr signals to plant cells and to secrete avr proteins in culture.
AB  == the hrp (type iii protein secretion) system is essential for the plant parasitic  ability of pseudomonas syringae and most gram-negative bacterial plant pathogens. avrb and avrpto are two p. syringae proteins that have biological activity when produced via heterologous gene expression inside plant cells or when produced by  hrp+ bacteria. avr-like proteins, presumably injected by the hrp system on bacterial contact with plant cells, appear to underlie pathogenic interactions, but none has been observed outside of the bacterial cytoplasm, and identifying novel genes encoding them is tedious and uncertain without a phenotype in culture. here we describe a cloned hrp secretion system that functions heterologously in escherichia coli to secrete avrb and avrpto in culture and to promote avrb and avrpto biological activity in inoculated plants. the hrp gene cluster, carried on cosmid pcpp2156, was cloned from erwinia chrysanthemi, a pathogen that differs from p. syringae in being host promiscuous. e. coli dh5alpha carrying pcpp2156, but not related hrp-deficient cosmids, elicited a hypersensitive response in nicotiana clevelandii only when also expressing avrb in trans. the use of pavrb-flag2 and pavrpto-flag, which produce avr proteins with a c-terminal flag-epitope fusion, enabled immunoblot detection of the secretion of these proteins to e. coli(pcpp2156) culture media. secretion was hrp dependent, occurred without leakage of a cytoplasmic marker, and did not occur with e. coli(phir11), which encodes a functional p. syringae hrp system. e. coli(pcpp2156) will promote investigation of avr protein secretion and systematic prospecting for the effector proteins underlying bacterial plant pathogenicity.

TI  == characterization of a novel rna regulator of erwinia carotovora ssp. carotovora that controls production of extracellular enzymes and secondary metabolites.
AB  == the enterobacterium erwinia carotovora ssp. carotovora strain 71 (hereafter ecc71) produces extracellular enzymes such as pectate lyase isozymes (pels), cellulase (cel), polygalacturonase (peh) and protease (prt). these enzymes degrade plant cell wall components and are largely responsible for the elicitation of soft-rot diseases in plants and plant products. ecc71 also produces harpinecc, the elicitor of hypersensitive reaction (hr) and the quorum-sensing signal, n-(3-oxohexanoyl)-l-homoserine lactone (ohl). ohl controls extracellular enzyme and harpinecc production. the levels of these enzymes, as well as the expression of hrpnecc, the structural gene for harpinecc, and ohll, the gene specifying ohl synthesis, are negatively regulated by rsmaa. rsmb, formerly aeph, on the other hand, positively regulates extracellular enzyme production. 6his-rsma recombinant protein purified from e. coli binds rsmb rna as indicated by gel mobility shift assays. rsmb comprises 547 bp dna, which is transcribed from a single start site immediately after a sigma70-like promoter. in ecc71, two rsmb rna species are detected: a full-length 479 base rsmb rna and  a 259 base rsmb' rna. rsmb' dna hybridizes with the 259 base and the 479 base transcripts. a 3' rnase protection assay revealed that the 259 base and the 479 base rna species end at the same position immediately after the putative rho-independent terminator. the expression of rsmb-lacz transcriptional fusions established that the rsmb' rna is not produced because of the activation of an internal promoter. these data strongly suggest that the 259 base rsmb' rna is derived by processing of the primary rsmb rna. in ecc71, rsmb' expression driven  by the lac promoter causes overproduction of pel, peh, cel and prt, and accumulation of pel-1, peh-1, hrpnecc and ohll transcripts. by contrast, a plasmid with the rsmb' dna sequence deleted fails to cause overproduction of the  extracellular enzymes in ecc71. the rsmb' effect also occurs in escherichia coli  as glycogen accumulation is stimulated in the presence of rsmb'. in vivo and in vitro translation as well as mutational analysis of rsmb' have established that rsmb' rna does not yield a translational product. therefore, we concluded that the rsmb' rna itself functions as the regulator. indeed, the expression rsmb' dna leads to neutralization of the negative effects of the rna-binding protein, rsma, in ecc71 and serratia marcescens strain sm274. we propose a model that explains how rsma and rsmb control the expression of genes for extracellular enzymes.

TI  == the extracytoplasmic function sigma factors: role and regulation.
AB  == alternative sigma factors provide a means of regulating gene expression in response to various extracellular changes. one such class of sigma factors appears to control a variety of functions, including expression of heat-shock genes in escherichia coli, biosynthesis of alginates and carotenoids in pseudomonas aeruginosa and myxococcus xanthus, respectively, iron uptake in e. coli and pseudomonas spp., nickel and cobalt efflux in alcaligenes europhus, plant pathogenicity in pseudomonas syringae and synthesis of outer membrane proteins in photobacterium sp. strain ss9. most of these activities deal with extracytoplasmic functions, and such sigmas have been designated as ecf sigma factors. they have also been characterized in mycobacteria as well as gram-positive bacteria such as streptomyces coelicolor and bacillus subtilus and  the archaea sulpholobus acidocaldarius. ecf factors belong to a subfamily of the  sigma 70 class, based on their sequence conservation and function across bacterial species. the promoter consensus sequences recognized by the ecf factors are also highly conserved. in most of the cases, the activity of these factors is modulated by a cognate inner membrane protein that has been shown, both in e. coli and in p. aeruginosa, to act as an anti-sigma activity. this inner membrane  protein is presumed to serve as a sensor and signalling molecule, allowing an adaptive response to specific environmental change. presumably, an on-and-off switch of the anti-sigma activity leads to the release of the sigma factor and thereby to the co-ordinate transcription of the specific regulon it governs.

AB  == rpos (sigma-s or sigma-38) controls a large array of genes that are expressed during stationary phase and under various stress conditions in escherichia coli and other bacteria. we document here that plant pathogenic and epiphytic erwinia  species, such as e. amylovora; e. carotovora subsp. atroseptica, betavasculorum,  and carotovora; e. chrysanthemi; e. herbicola; e. rhapontici; and e. stewartii, possess rpos genes and produce the alternate sigma factor. we show that rpos transcription in e. carotovora subsp. carotovora is driven from a major promoter  which resides within the nlpd gene located upstream of rpos as in e. coli. rpos-  e. carotovora subsp. carotovoa strain ac5061, constructed by marker exchange, is  more sensitive to hydrogen peroxide, carbon starvation, and acidic ph than its rpos+ parent strain, ac5006. the basal levels of extracellular pectate lyase, polygalacturonase, and cellulase as well as those of transcripts of e. carotovora subsp. carotovora hrpn (hrpnecc), the gene for the elicitor of the hypersensitive reaction, are higher in the rpos- strain than in the rpos+ parent. likewise, compared to ac5006, ac5061 causes more extensive maceration of celery petioles. our findings with the rpos- mutant and strains carrying multiple copies rpos+ dna reveal that rpos positively controls rsma expression. we also present evidence that supports the hypothesis that the rpos effect on extracellular enzyme levels, hrpnecc expression, and virulence manifests itself by the modulation of rsma expression.

TI  == analysis of genes involved in biosynthesis of coronafacic acid, the polyketide component of the phytotoxin coronatine.
AB  == coronafacic acid (cfa) is the polyketide component of coronatine (cor), a phytotoxin produced by the plant-pathogenic bacterium pseudomonas syringae. the genes involved in cfa biosynthesis are encoded by a single transcript which encompasses 19 kb of the cor gene cluster. in the present study, the nucleotide sequence was determined for a 4-kb region located at the 3' end of the cfa biosynthetic gene cluster. three open reading frames were identified and designated cfa8, cfa9, and tnp1; the predicted translation products of these genes showed relatedness to oxidoreductases, thioesterases, and transposases, respectively. the translational products of cfa8 and cfa9 were overproduced in escherichia coli bl21; however, tnp1 was not translated in these experiments. mutagenesis and complementation analysis indicated that cfa8 is required for the  production of cfa and cor. analysis of a cfa9 mutant indicated that this gene is  dispensable for cfa and cor production but may increase the release of enzyme-bound products from the cor pathway; tnp1, however, had no obvious function in cfa or cor biosynthesis. a genetic strategy was used to produce cfa in a p. syringae strain which lacks the cor gene cluster; this approach will be useful in future studies designed to investigate biosynthetic products of the cfa gene cluster.

AB  == 75 strains of 21 various pseudomonas syringae (p.) pathovars were investigated in different tests for their toxin production. data from literature about the production of the known phytotoxins phaseolotoxin (pv. phaseolicola), tabtoxin (pv. coronafaciens, pv. tabaci), coronatine (pv. atropurpurea, pv. glycinea, pv.  maculicola, pv. morsprunorum, pv. tomato), and toxins of the lipodepsipeptide group (pv. aptata, pv. atrofaciens, pv. syringae) could be confirmed. besides, a  production of the phytohormone ethylene was detected for p. phaseolicola isolates from kudzu (pueraria lobata) and for all tested p. glycinea and p. cannabina strains. strains of p. apii, p. aptata, p. atrofaciens, and p. tomato produced antimetabolic toxins which could be detected with an agar diffusion assay with escherichia coli as indicator strain. these antimetabolites inhibit a step in the arginine/ornithine biosynthesis. p. maculicola strains caused inhibition zones in this assay which could not be reversed by the tested amino acids. all strains with inhibitory effect against e. coli and geotrichum candidum were also proved for their antagonistic activity against a selection of typical phyllosphere microorganisms. most of the phytotoxins possess antimicrobial activity with different spectrum and efficiency. only the lipodepsipeptide-producers showed antifungal activities. our results show that the production of toxins is a widespread property among pseudomonas syringae pathovars, and that some pathovars can produce more than one toxin. this characteristic and the antimicrobial activity of most toxins could be of advantage for the toxin-producing bacteria to adapt to different habitats.

AB  == various gram-negative animal and plant pathogens use a novel, sec-independent protein secretion system as a basic virulence mechanism. it is becoming increasingly clear that these so-called type iii secretion systems inject (translocate) proteins into the cytosol of eukaryotic cells, where the translocated proteins facilitate bacterial pathogenesis by specifically interfering with host cell signal transduction and other cellular processes. accordingly, some type iii secretion systems are activated by bacterial contact with host cell surfaces. individual type iii secretion systems direct the secretion and translocation of a variety of unrelated proteins, which account for species-specific pathogenesis phenotypes. in contrast to the secreted virulence factors, most of the 15 to 20 membrane-associated proteins which constitute the type iii secretion apparatus are conserved among different pathogens. most of the inner membrane components of the type iii secretion apparatus show additional homologies to flagellar biosynthetic proteins, while a conserved outer membrane factor is similar to secretins from type ii and other secretion pathways. structurally conserved chaperones which specifically bind to individual secreted  proteins play an important role in type iii protein secretion, apparently by preventing premature interactions of the secreted factors with other proteins. the genes encoding type iii secretion systems are clustered, and various pieces of evidence suggest that these systems have been acquired by horizontal genetic transfer during evolution. expression of type iii secretion systems is coordinately regulated in response to host environmental stimuli by networks of transcription factors. this review comprises a comparison of the structure, function, regulation, and impact on host cells of the type iii secretion systems  in the animal pathogens yersinia spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, shigella flexneri, salmonella typhimurium, enteropathogenic escherichia coli, and chlamydia spp. and the plant pathogens pseudomonas syringae, erwinia spp., ralstonia solanacearum, xanthomonas campestris, and rhizobium spp.

TI  == a tellurite-resistance genetic determinant from phytopathogenic pseudomonads encodes a thiopurine methyltransferase: evidence of a widely-conserved family of  methyltransferases.
AB  == a tellurite-resistance genetic determinant was isolated from the pea blight pathogen pseudomonas syringae pathovar pisi by a shotgun strategy involving a tellurite-selective screening in escherichia coli. a 1.65 kb tellurite resistance insert was obtained and analysed. it harbours a single complete and functional orf encoding a deduced protein of 24, 445 da. the deduced aa sequence shows significant similarities with the complete human thiopurine methyltransferase enzyme, a methyltransferase from synechocystis and a methyltransferase-like sequence from bordetella pertussis. the encoded thiopurine methyltransferase activity was demonstrated using a radiochemical microassay for the methylation of 6-mercaptopurine. this gene was detected in most p. syringae legume pathogens.

TI  == ptn5cat: a tn5-derived genetic element to facilitate insertion mutagenesis, promoter probing, physical mapping, cloning, and marker exchange in phytopathogenic and other gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == a tn5-derived mobile element has been constructed to identify genes and promoters related to pathogenesis and virulence in pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola. to enhance the rate of mutation this tn5 derivative was constructed carrying a mutant transposase which was placed in cis to the transposable element, but just  outside the inverted repeats, therefore eliminating secondary transposition and increasing the stability of the insertion. the new element also contains a promoterless cat (chloramphenicol acetyltransferase) gene as reporter to allow for positive selection of promoters being expressed under specific conditions. to facilitate cloning and manipulations in escherichia coli, a cole1 origin of replication has been included within the transposable element as well as the mob  region from the broad-host-range plasmid rp4, which allows this element to be efficiently mobilized by a triparental mating or by using an e. coli strain such  as s17-1 to provide the tra functions. sites for the rare cutters paci and pmei have also been included to facilitate locating the insertions on a paci and/or pmei physical map. this construction combines the properties of both a mobilizable plasmid and a transposon and therefore has been termed ptn5cat. it is almost the same size as the wild-type tn5, 5877 bp, and has successfully been tested in p.s. phaseolicola and xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris.

TI  == expression of carboxymethylcellulase on the surface of escherichia coli using pseudomonas syringae ice nucleation protein.
AB  == ice-nucleation protein (inp), an outer membrane protein from pseudomonas syringae, is able to catalyze the ice crystal formation of supercooled water. it  was exploited for anchoring of bacillus subtilis carboxymethylcellulase (cmcase)  on the surface of escherichia coli. a surface anchoring vector, pginp21m, was created that contains the multicloning sites including bamhi, smai and ecori at the end of the 3' flanking region encoding the c-terminus of inp instead of the stop codon for subcloning the foreign genes. the cmcase gene was in-frame subcloned for making inp-cmcase fusion proteins. the ability of this vector for directing the actual synthesis of inp-cmcase fusion proteins was confirmed by western blotting analysis. cmcase targeted on the surface of cells was verified by measuring whole cell cmcase activity and ice-nucleation activity. cmcase activity was mainly detected on the cell surface whereas no enzyme activity was detected in the culture supernatant. ice-nucleation activity was also maintained  even if an inp-cmcase hybrid was made. this means that the fusion protein is functionally expressed and has its biological conformation on the surface. inp-cmcase fusion proteins were stable in the stationary phase. inp deleted of the repeating domain, thus producing no ice-nucleation activity, could also direct cmcase on the cell surface. this suggests that it has the secretion and targeting signal to the outer membrane.

TI  == the phte locus in the phaseolotoxin gene cluster has orfs with homologies to genes encoding amino acid transferases, the arac family of transcriptional factors, and fatty acid desaturases.
AB  == a cluster of genes involved in the production of phaseolotoxin, a phytotoxin produced by pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola, contains eight (phta through phth) complementation groups (y. x. zhang, k. b. rowley, and s. s. patil, j. bacteriol., 175:6451-6458, 1993). in this study, sequencing of the region encompassing the phte locus revealed six putative open reading frames (orfs), each preceded by a putative ribosomal binding site, and all oriented in the same  direction. reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction suggested that the phte locus is transcribed as one large (6.4 kb) transcript, indicating that the orfs constitute an operon. primer extension analysis showed that the transcript begins at a t, located 31 bp upstream of the atg codon of orf1. comparison of the sequences of the putative orfs with the sequences of known genes revealed that orf3, encoding a protein containing 395 amino acids, has 55% similarity to the acetylornithine aminotransferase gene from escherichia coli, and the ornithine aminotransferase genes from other organisms. a lysine residue that is a binding site for pyridoxal phosphate and an arginine residue that is a binding site for the alpha-carboxylate group of the substrate are conserved in orf3. these data suggest that orf3 encodes a protein involved in the biosynthesis of ornithine, a  constituent of phaseolotoxin. orf5, encoding a peptide of 378 amino acid residues, possesses a helix-turn-helix motif at the c-terminal end that is characteristic of the arac family of transcriptional factors, and there is a possible leucine zipper at the n-terminal end of this peptide. orf6, encoding a protein of 327 amino acids, has about 40% similarity with the fatty acid desaturase gene, desa, of synechocystis pcc6803 and considerable similarity with  fatty acid desaturase genes from other organisms. orf6 and desa show very similar hydropathy profiles and both contain a copper binding signature. computer searches did not discover significant homologies in the data base for the other orfs, but hydropathy analysis showed that all of them contain one to several hydrophobic domains, suggesting that the gene products of these orfs may be membrane associated.

TI  == expression and analysis of coronafacate ligase, a thermoregulated gene required for production of the phytotoxin coronatine in pseudomonas syringae.
AB  == coronafacic acid, the polyketide component of the phytotoxin coronatine, is activated and coupled to coronamic acid via amide bond formation, a biosynthetic  step presumably catalyzed by the coronafacate ligase (cfl) gene product. in the present study, cfl was fused to the carboxy terminus of male, which encodes the maltose-binding protein (mbp), and overexpressed in escherichia coli. immunoblot  analysis indicated that cfl contained an atp-binding region, a motif conserved in enzymes which activate their substrates by adenylation. mbp-cfl was overproduced  and purified from pseudomonas syringae and the protein fusion was used to generate antisera. anti-mbp-cfl antibodies and a transcriptional fusion of the cfl promoter to a promoterless glucuronidase gene were used to follow the temporal expression of coronafacate ligase. the results indicated that transcription of cfl is temperature-sensitive. furthermore, a nonpolar mutation in cfl suggested that the gene may have a role in coronafacic acid biosynthesis.

TI  == a possible role for acetylated intermediates in diaminopimelate and tabtoxinine-beta-lactam biosynthesis in pseudomonas syringae pv. tabaci br2.024.
AB  == the deduced product of an open reading frame (orf3) located in the tabtoxinine-beta-lactam (t beta l) biosynthetic region of pseudomonas syringae pv. tabaci br2.024 (br2.024) has significant sequence homology to the dapd products of other bacteria. dapd encodes l-2,3,4,5-tetrahydrodipicolinate succinyl coenzyme a succinyltransferase (thdpa-st), an enzyme in the diaminopimelate (dap) and lysine biosynthetic pathway. complementation studies, in vitro transcription-translation experiments, and enzymatic assays indicated that orf3 encodes a product with thdpa-st activity in escherichia coli dapd mutant beta 274. however, a br2.024 mutant with an insert in orf3 was prototrophic, and only basal thdpa-st activity was detected in extracts of both parent and mutant. this finding suggested that orf3 was not required for dap biosynthesis and that it did not encode a product with thdpa-st activity. the results of enzymatic studies, indicating that br2.024 uses acetylated intermediates for dap biosynthesis, are consistent with the hypothesis that br2.024 does not need thdpa-st for dap biosynthesis. the orf3 mutant produced reduced levels of tabtoxin, indicating that orf3 may have a role in t beta l biosynthesis. we have named the gene tabb and have proposed a possible function for the gene product.

TI  == analysis of the syrp gene, which regulates syringomycin synthesis by pseudomonas  syringae pv. syringae.
AB  == syringomycin is a lipodepsinonapeptide phytotoxin synthesized by pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae on multienzymatic peptide synthetases. sequence analysis of the interval between the syrb and syrd genes of p. syringae pv. syringae strain b301d revealed a 1,059-bp open reading frame (orf), designated syrp. the predicted product of this orf was a 39.6-kda protein consisting of 353 amino acid residues. searches of protein sequence databases demonstrated that syrp was most  similar to histidine kinases such as the chea regulatory protein of escherichia coli. the predicted syrp sequence was aligned with the n terminus of chea, a region corresponding to the phosphotransfer and acceptor domains of chea. the syrp region that aligns with the phosphotransfer domain of chea contained a his at position 101 which is flanked by a weak consensus sequence of the unorthodox sensory kinase subfamily of two-component regulatory systems. strain b301d-31, obtained by site-directed insertional mutagenesis of the syrp gene, exhibited an  unusual pleiotropic phenotype including a failure to produce syringomycin in liquid media in contrast to production of elevated levels of the toxin on agar media. the syrp mutant was relieved of the suppression of toxin production that accompanies inorganic phosphate concentrations of > 1 mm on agar media. nevertheless, the syrp mutant was substantially less virulent than the wild-type  strain in pathogenicity assays in cherry fruits. these results suggest that the syrp gene encodes a regulatory protein that participates in a phosphorylation cascade controlling syringomycin production and virulence in p. syringae pv. syringae.

TI  == evidence that the pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae hrp-linked hrma gene encodes  an avr-like protein that acts in an hrp-dependent manner within tobacco cells.
AB  == a 25-kb dna region, previously cloned from pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae 61 in cosmid phir11, enables nonpathogenic bacteria such as pseudomonas fluorescens  and escherichia coli to elicit the hypersensitive response (hr) in tobacco (nicotiana tabacum). hrma is located within this region, adjacent to a conserved  cluster of hrp genes, and is essential for nonpathogens to elicit the hr. dna sequence analysis suggested that hrma was the second of two genes in an operon and was preceded by an open reading frame (orf), orf1, which is predicted to encode a 10.9-kda protein. dna gel blot analysis revealed that sequences hybridizing with a dna fragment internal to hrma were absent from p. syringae pv. syringae b728a, p. syringae pv. tabaci 11528, and p. syringae pv. glycinea race 4 u1, but present in p. syringae pv. tomato dc3000. a 2.4-kb bamhi-avrii fragment carrying hrma, orf1, and native regulatory sequences was subcloned into broad-host-range vector pdsk519 and electroporated into p. syringae pv. syringae  b728a and p. syringae pv. tabaci 11528. the presence of the hrma locus had no apparent effect on the ability of p. syringae pv. syringae b728a to cause brown spot of bean, but it caused p. syringae pv. tabaci 11528 to elicit the defense-associated hr rather than disease in n. tabacum cvs. xanthi n and xanthi  nc and n. clevelandii. furthermore, n. debeyii, n. glutinosa, n. rustica, and n.  tabacum cvs. petit havana and samsun responded with the hr to p. fluorescens(phir11). in contrast, n. benthamiana-p. syringae pv. tabaci interactions were unaffected by the presence of hrma, and p. fluorescens(phir11)  did not elicit the hr in n. benthamiana. the hrma orf was subcloned into pflag-ctc, which expressed hrma with a c-terminal flag synthetic epitope fusion.  escherichia coli mc4100 cells carrying the functional hrp cluster and the hrma-flag derivative secreted the hrpz harpin, but not hrma-flag, to the medium,  as indicated by immunoblot analysis with m2 anti-flag and polyclonal anti-hrpz antibodies. the hrma orf was also subcloned into plant expression vector pff19 and then biolistically delivered, along with pff19g (expressing beta-glucuronidase), into suspension-cultured tobacco cells. histochemical staining 24 h later revealed substantial beta-glucuronidase activity in cells receiving pff19g and pff19 but not in those receiving pff19g and pff19-hrma. thus, internal production of hrma was deleterious to tobacco cells.

TI  == plasmid pip501 encoded transcriptional repressor copr binds asymmetrically at two consecutive major grooves of the dna.
AB  == replication of the streptococcal plasmid pip501 is regulated by the copr protein  and an antisense-rna (rnaiii). copr acts as transcriptional repressor at the essential repr promoter pii by binding to inverted repeat ir1 upstream of pii. to further characterize the interaction of copr with its target, footprinting studies were performed. methylation interference identified three guanine bases (g240, g242 and g251) in the top strand and two (g252 and g254) in the bottom strand contacted by copr in the major groove of the dna. missing base interference revealed the contribution of the bases in the neighbourhood of these guanine bases to the specific dna-protein contacts. phosphate residues essential  for copr binding were determined by ethylation interference. the recognition sequence was localized at the centre of inverted repeat ir1. copr contacts two consecutive major grooves (site i and ii) on the same face of the dna. although the two sites share a common sequence motif, neighbouring bases are contacted differently. dna fragments carrying single mutations in site i or ii were analysed by band shift assays. gel filtration and native gel electrophoresis demonstrated that copr exists only as a dimer. a sigmoidal binding curve of copr  to its dna target was observed and allowed the determination of the apparent dissociation constant k(d). the significance of the relatively high apparent k(d) for the role of copr in pip501 copy number regulation is discussed.

TI  == use of tn5-gusa5 to investigate environmental and nutritional effects on gene expression in the coronatine biosynthetic gene cluster of pseudomonas syringae pv. glycinea.
AB  == pseudomonas syringae pv. glycinea pg4180 produces coronatine (cor), a chlorosis-inducing phytotoxin that consists of the polyketide coronafacic acid (cfa) coupled via an amide bond to the ethylcyclopropyl amino acid coronamic acid (cma). both cfa and cma function as intermediates in the pathway to coronatine, and genes encoding their synthesis have been localized: however, the precise factors that regulate the production of cor and its precursors remain unclear. in the present study, a lambda delivery system for tn5-gusa5 was developed and used  to obtain transcriptional fusions in the cor gene cluster. selected carbon (fructose and xylose) and amino acid (isoleucine and valine) sources significantly decreased cor biosynthesis at the transcriptional level. transcriptional activity in the cor gene cluster was temperature dependent with maximal expression at 18-24 degrees c and significantly less expression at 14 and 30 degrees c. interestingly, changes in osmolarity and the addition of complex carbon and nitrogen sources to the growth medium did not significantly affect cor gene expression, although both factors significantly impacted the quantity of cor produced. these results indicate that multiple factors impact cor production and  only some of these directly affect transcription in the cor gene cluster.

TI  == molecular characterization and expression of the erwinia carotovora hrpnecc gene, which encodes an elicitor of the hypersensitive reaction.
AB  == the nucleotide sequence of hrpnecc dna, cloned from erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora strain ecc71, reveals a coding region of 1,068 bp which matches the size of hrpnecc transcripts. hrpnecc is predicted to encode a glycine-rich protein of approximately 36 kda. like the elicitors of the hypersensitive reaction (hr) produced by e. chrysanthemi (harpinech) and e. amylovora (harpinea), the deduced 36-kda protein does not possess a typical signal sequence, but it contains a putative membrane-spanning domain. in escherichia coli strains overexpressing hrpnecc, the 36-kda protein has been identified as the hrpnecc product by western blot analysis using anti-harpinech antibodies. the 36-kda protein fractionated from e. coli elicits the hr in tobacco leaves. moreover, a hrpn- and rsma- double mutant (rsma = regulator of secondary metabolites) does not produce this 36-kda protein or elicit the hr, although this strain, like the rsma- and hrpn+ bacteria, overproduces extracellular enzymes and macerates celery petioles. these observations demonstrate that hrpnecc encodes the elicitor of the hr, designated harpinecc. the levels of hrpnecc transcripts are affected in both rsma+ and rsma- strains by media composition and carbon sources, although the mrna levels are substantially higher in the rsma- strains.  the expression of hrpnecc in ecc71 is cell density dependent and is activated by  the quorum-sensing signal, n-(3-oxohexanoyl)-l-homoserine lactone (ohl). by contrast, hrpnecc expression in an rsma- strain is independent of cell density, and substantial expression occurs in the absence of ohl. the effects of cultural  conditions and the occurrence of putative cis-acting sequences, such as consensus sigma 54 promoters and an hrp promoter upstream of the transcriptional start site, indicate that the production of harpinecc in wild-type rsma+ e. carotovora  subsp. carotovora is tightly regulated. these observations, taken along with the  finding that the hr is caused by rsma- mutants but not by rsma+ strains (cui et al., 1996, mol. plant-microbe interact. 9:565-573), strongly support the idea that the inability of the wild-type pectolytic e. carotovora subsp. carotovora to elicit the hr is due to the lack of a significant level of harpinecc production.

AB  == a mutational analysis of lesion-forming ability was undertaken in pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae b728a, causal agent of bacterial brown spot disease of bean. following a screen of 6,401 tn5-containing derivatives of b728a on bean pods, 26 strains that did not form disease lesions were identified. nine of the mutant strains were defective in the ability to elicit the hypersensitive reaction (hr) and were shown to contain tn5 insertions within the p. syringae pv. syringae hrp region. ten hr+ mutants were defective in the production of the toxin syringomycin, and a region of the chromosome implicated in the biosynthesis of syringomycin was deleted in a subset of these mutants. the remaining seven lesion-defective mutants retained the ability to produce protease and syringomycin. marker exchange mutagenesis confirmed that the tn5 insertion was causal to the mutant phenotype in several lesion-defective, hr+ strains. kw239, a lesion- and syringomycin-deficient mutant, was characterized at the molecular level. sequence analysis of the chromosomal region flanking the tn5 within kw239  revealed strong similarities to a number of known escherichia coli gene products  and dna sequences: the nusa operon, including the complete initiator trna(met) gene, mety; a trna(leu) gene; the tpia gene product; and the mrsa protein. removal of sequences containing the two potential trna genes prevented restoration of mutant kw239 in trans. the tn5 insertions within the lesion-deficient strains examined, including kw239, were not closely linked to each other or to the lema or gaca genes previously identified as involved in lesion formation by p. syringae pv. syringae.

AB  == protein production encoded by the avirulence gene avrpphb from pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola was examined. incorporation of [35s]-labeled methionine into the avrpphb protein indicated processing of the full-length peptide in escherichia coli to give a major 28-kda product. the 28-kda native peptide was isolated from e. coli following over-expression of avrpphb and found not to elicit the hypersensitive response (hr) after infiltration into bean leaves. antiserum raised to the 28-kda peptide allowed expression of avrpphb and processing of avrpphb protein to be examined in p. syringae pv. phaseolicola; immunoreactive peptides of both 35 and 28-kda were detected in races 3 and 4 (which contain avrpphb) only after induction in minimal medium + 10 mm sucrose. antiserum raised to a synthetic peptide, derived from the sequence of the 62 amino acids found to be cleaved from the full-length avrpphb protein, revealed the accumulation of peptides corresponding to the smaller cleavage products, in both e. coli and p. syringae pv. phaseolicola. biochemical localization experiments showed that all avrpphb peptides were cytoplasmic in p. syringae pv.  phaseolicola. no avrpphb peptides were produced in a hrpl mutant unless expression of the gene was directed by a strong vector promoter; induction kinetics similar to wild type were observed in a hrpy- strain, although it also failed to cause a confluent hr. growth of p. syringae pv. phaseolicola under inducing conditions removed the requirement for rifampicin-sensitive mrna synthesis by bacteria to allow hr development (the induction time) in bean and lettuce leaves. constitutive expression of hrpl reduced but did not remove the induction time. expression of the hrp gene cluster of p. syringae pv. phaseolicola from plasmid pppy430 in e. coli enabled phenotypic expression of avrpphe (also carried by pppy430) and avrpphb (if over-expressed from pppy3031).  despite constitutive expression of the hrp and avr genes in e. coli, a protein synthesis dependent induction time was still required for development of the hr in bean genotypes with matching resistance genes. the significance of processing  for the function of avrpphb peptides and the delivery of elicitors of the hr are  discussed.

AB  == a 6.2-kb region of dna corresponding to complementation groups ii and iii of the  erwinia amylovora hrp gene cluster was analyzed. transposon mutagenesis indicated that the two complementation groups are required for secretion of harpin, an elicitor of the hypersensitive reaction. the sequence of the region revealed 10 open reading frames in two putative transcription units: hrpa, hrpb, hrcj, hrpd,  and hrpe in the hrpa operon (group iii) and hrpf, hrpg, hrcc, hrpt, and hrpv in the hrpc operon (group ii). from promoter regions of the hrpa, hrpc, and hrpn operons, sequences similar to those of the hrpl-dependent promoters of pseudomonas syringae pathovars were identified with a consensus sequence of 5'-ggaac-n17-18-cactnaa-3'. the protein products of seven genes, hrpa, hrcj, hrpe, hrpf, hrpg, hrcc, and hrpv, were visualized with a t7 polymerase/promoter expression system. hrcc, hrcj, and hrpt sequences contained potential signal peptides, and hrcc appeared to be envelope associated based on a tnphoa translational fusion. comparison of deduced amino acid sequences indicated that many of the proteins are homologous to proteins that function in the type iii protein secretion pathway. hrcc is a member of the yscc-containing subgroup in the puld/piv superfamily of outer membrane proteins. hrcj is a member of a lipoprotein family that includes yscj of yersinia spp., mxij of shigella flexneri, and nolt of rhizobim fredii. additional similarities were detected between hrpb and ysci and between hrpe and yscl. hrcj and hrpe were similar to flagellar biogenesis proteins flif and flih, respectively. in addition, hrpa, hrpb, hrcj, hrpd, hrpe, hrpf, and hrcc showed various degrees of similarity to corresponding proteins of p. syringae. comparison of hrp clusters with respect to gene organization and similarity of individual proteins confirms that the hrp systems of e. amylovora and p. syringae are closely related to each other and distinct from those of ralstonia (pseudomonas) solanacearum and xanthomonas campestris. possible implications of extensive similarities between the e. amylovora and p. syringae hrp systems in pathogenesis mechanisms are discussed.

TI  == pilp, a pilus biogenesis lipoprotein in neisseria gonorrhoeae, affects expression of pilq as a high-molecular-mass multimer.
AB  == studies of gonococcal pilus biogenesis are fundamental to understanding organelle structure/function relationships and identifying new approaches to controlling disease. this area of research is also relevant to elucidating the basic mechanisms of outer membrane translocation of macromolecules, which requires components highly related to those involved in type iv pilus expression. previous studies have shown that products of several ancillary pil genes are required for  organelle biogenesis but of these only pilq, a member of the gspd protein family, is a component of the outer membrane. dna sequencing of the region upstream of pilq revealed the presence of two open reading frames (orfs) whose deduced polypeptides shared significant identities with proteins required for pilus expression in pseudomonas aeruginosa and pseudomonas syringae, the genes for which are arrayed upstream of a gene encoding a pilq homologue. gonococcal mutants bearing transposon insertions in these orfs were non-piliated and failed  to express pilus-associated phenotypes, and the corresponding genes were designated pilo and pilp. the piliation defects in the mutants could not be ascribed to polarity on distal pilq expression as shown by direct measurement of  pilq antigen in those backgrounds and the use of a novel technique to create tandem duplications in the gonococcus (gc) genome. as predicted by the presence of a consensus lipoprotein signal sequence, pilp expressed in both escherichia coli and gc could be labelled with [3h]-palmitic acid. pilp- as well as pilq- mutants shed pilc, a protein which facilitates pilus assembly and is implicated in epithelial cell adherence, in a soluble form. combined with the finding that levels of multimerized piiq were greatly reduced in pilp- mutants, the results suggest that pilp is required for pilq function and that pilq and pilc may interact during the terminal stages of pilus biogenesis. the findings also support the hypothesis that the gc pilq multimer corresponds to a physiologically relevant form of the protein required for pilus biogenesis.

TI  == relative expression and stability of a chromosomally integrated and plasmid-borne marker gene fusion in environmentally competent bacteria.
AB  == a xyle-icec transcriptional fusion was created by ligatinga dna fragment harboring the cloned xyle structural gene from the tol plasmid of pseudomonas putida mt-2 into the cloned icec gene of pseudomonas syringae cit7. this fusion construct was integrated into the chromosome of pseudomonas syringae cit7 by homologous recombination. both cis-merodiploid strain cit7m17 and marker exchange strain cit7h69 produced the xyle gene product, catechol2,3-dioxygenase. strain cit7m17, in which xyle was influenced by transcription initiated by the amp promoter on pbr322, exhibited xyle activity in stationary phase at levels about 45 times higher than strain cit7h69, permitting detection of 10(7) cit7m17 cells  in the spectrophotometric assay and 10(3) cells in hplc measurements. the stability of xyle in both cit7m17 and cit7h69 was compared with maintenance of xyle in several plasmid-borne constructs in p.aeruginosa, erwinia herbicola, and  escherichia coli. only the xyle-icec fusion in the chromosome of cit7h69 and cit7m17was stable in plate assays over the course of these studies. even though strain cit7h69 stably expressed xyle, the low level of expression precludes its use in direct spectrophotometric or hplc assays as a means for detecting cells in environmental samples. however, expression of xylein cit7h69 is sufficient for identification of colonies harboring this marker gene which is useful in laboratory plate assays, and as a marker gene system for the detection of environmentally-competent strains chromosomally taggedwith xyle for use in autecological studies.

TI  == characterization of the cryptic plasmids of the pseudomonas alcaligenes type strain.
AB  == the species type strain of pseudomonas alcaligenes contains three small cryptic plasmids (designated pecb1, 2, and 3) of 7740, 4480, and 2700 bp, respectively. partial restriction enzyme maps have been constructed for pecb1 and 2 which on this basis do not appear to be related. pecb3 proved refractile to cutting with commonly used restriction enzymes, though it was completely rendered by those enzymes which recognize 4-bp sequences containing only g + c. this suggested that pecb3 is especially rich in these bases. hybridization studies using labeled pecb2 as probe revealed homology with pecb3 and with regions of the bacterial chromosome, but not with pecb1. a 1214-bp region of pecb2 showed great sequence similarity to the basic replicon of pps10, a 10-kb pseudomonas-specific plasmid isolated from pseudomonas syringae pv. savastonoi. the putative replicon (including the gene for a replication protein) was subcloned and both dna strands were sequenced. introduction of the putative replicon into the escherichia coli plasmid puc19 created a recombinant vector able to replicate in both e. coli and  pseudomonas spp. minicell analyses did not reveal any peptides which could be attributed to the remaining region of pecb2 or to pecb1--a finding supported by sequencing studies. attempts at plasmid curing were unsuccessful. a phenotypic comparison with a non-plasmid-harboring strain of p. alcaligenes, based on nutritional versatility and antibiotic susceptibility, revealed a single difference of note: the type strain alone was able to utilize benzoate for growth. transformation of the non-harboring strain with pecb1-3, followed by selection on a minimal medium containing benzoate, gave no colonies. the advantages gained by possession of pecb1-3, if any, are at present unknown.

TI  == expression of the pseudomonas syringae avirulence protein avrb in plant cells alleviates its dependence on the hypersensitive response and pathogenicity (hrp)  secretion system in eliciting genotype-specific hypersensitive cell death.
AB  == the nonpathogenic bacteria pseudomonas fluorescens and escherichia coli can elicit a genotype-specific hypersensitive response (hr) in plants if they express both the hr and pathogenesis (hrp) protein secretion system and the hrpz harpin from p. syringae pv syringae 61 and a p. syringae avirulence (avr) gene whose presence is recognized by a corresponding disease resistance gene in the plant. we have found that the recognition event appears to require transfer of the avr protein into the plant cell. elicitation of a genotype-specific hr was observed with avrb+ p. fluorescens in soybean and arabidopsis plants carrying resistance genes rpg1 and rpm1, respectively, and with avrpto+ e. coll in tomato plants carrying resistance gene pto, but only if the hrp secretion system, hrpz, and the appropriate avr proteins were produced in the same bacterial cell. the failure of avrb hyperexpression and exogenous avrb or hrpz to alleviate these requirements in soybean and arabidopsis suggests that the site of avrb action is not in the bacterial cell or plant apoplast. an arabidopsis rps3 (rpm1) glabrous1 mutant was transformed with constructs expressing avrb and was crossed with an arabidopsis ecotype columbia (rpm1 glabrous1) plant. f1 seedlings (identified by their kanamycin-resistant, pubescent phenotype) exhibited extensive necrosis on cotyledon leaves 10 days postgermination. ecotype columbia and rps3-1 leaves biolistically cobombarded with plasmids expressing the beta-glucuronidase (gus) gene and avrb failed to produce gus activity (indicative of cell death) only when rpm1 and avrb were present in the leaf. thus, both stable and transient expression of avrb in arabidopsis resulted in rpm1-dependent necrosis, and the only demonstrable site of action for avrb was inside plant cells.

TI  == phenotypic expression of pseudomonas syringae avr genes in e. coli is linked to the activities of the hrp-encoded secretion system.
AB  == the specific recognition of elicitors produced by plant pathogenic bacteria carrying avirulence (avr) genes is postulated to initiate cellular defense responses in plants expressing corresponding resistance genes. the biochemical functions of most avr genes, however, are not known. a heterologous system was developed to phenotypically express pseudomonas syringae avr genes in escherichia coli cells that required the p. syringae hrp cluster. e. coli mc4100 transformants carrying the plasmic-borne p. syringae pv. syringae pss61 hrp cluster and p. syringae pv. glycinea avrb expressed from a triple lacuv5 promoter gained the ability to elicit the hypersensitive response in soybean cultivars expressing rpg1 and in an arabidopsis thaliana accession expressing rpm1. inactivation of energy transducing or outer membrane components of the hrp-encoded secretion system blocked phenotypic expression expression of avrb in  e. coli, but deletions abolishing harpinpss production had little effect on the production of the avrb phenotype by the e. coli transformants. phenotypic expression of avra, avrpto, avrrpm1, avrrpt2, and avrpph3 in e. coli was also shown to require the hrp cluster. the results indicate that generation of the avr phenotype in p. syringae strains is specifically dependent on the secretion activities of the hrp cluster.

TI  == gene repression by the ferric uptake regulator in pseudomonas aeruginosa: cycle selection of iron-regulated genes.
AB  == the expression of at least 24 distinct genes of pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1 is under direct control of the "ferric uptake regulator" (fur). novel targets of the fur protein were isolated in a powerful selex (systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment)-like cycle selection consisting of in vitro dna-fur interaction, binding to anti-fur antibody, purification on protein g, and pcr amplification. dna fragments obtained after at least three exponential enrichment cycles were cloned and subjected to dna mobility-shift assays and dnase i footprint analyses to verify the specific interaction with the fur protein in vitro. iron-dependent expression of the corresponding genes in vivo was monitored by rnase protection analysis. in total, 20 different dna fragments were identified which represent actual pseudomonas iron-regulated genes (pigs). while  four pigs are identical to already known genes (pfer, pvds, tonb, and fumc, respectively), 16 pigs represent previously unknown genes. homology studies of the putative proteins encoded by the pigs allowed us to speculate about their possible function. two pig products were highly similar to siderophore receptors  from various species, and three pig products were significantly homologous to alternative sigma factors. furthermore, homologs of the escherichia coli orf1-tolq, nuoa, stringent starvation protein ssp, and of a two-component regulatory system similar to the pseudomonas syringae lema sensor kinase were identified. the putative gene products of seven additional pigs did not show significant homologies to any known proteins. the pigs were mapped on the p.aeruginosa chromosome. their possible role in iron metabolism and virulence of  p. aeruginosa is discussed.

TI  == erwinia amylovora secretes harpin via a type iii pathway and contains a homolog of yopn of yersinia spp.
AB  == type iii secretion functions in flagellar biosynthesis and in export of virulence factors from several animal pathogens, and for plant pathogens, it has been shown to be involved in the export of elicitors of the hypersensitive reaction. typified by the yop delivery system of yersinia spp., type iii secretion is sec independent and requires multiple components. sequence analysis of an 11.5-kb region of the hrp gene cluster of erwinia amylovora containing hrpi, a previously characterized type iii gene, revealed a group of eight or more type iii genes corresponding to the virb or lcrb (yscn-to-yscu) locus of yersinia spp. a homolog of another yop secretion gene, yscd, was found between hrpi and this group downstream. immediately upstream of hrpi, a homolog of yopn was discovered. yopn  is a putative sensor involved in host-cell-contact-triggered expression and transfer of protein, e.g., yope, to the host cytoplasm. in-frame deletion mutagenesis of one of the type iii genes, designated hrct, was nonpolar and resulted in a hrp- strain that produced but did not secrete harpin, an elicitor of the hypersensitive reaction that is also required for pathogenesis. cladistic  analysis of the hrpi (herein renamed hrcv) or lcrd protein family revealed two distinct groups for plant pathogens. the yersinia protein grouped more closely with the plant pathogen homologs than with homologs from other animal pathogens;  flagellar biosynthesis proteins grouped distinctly. a possible evolutionary history of type iii secretion is presented, and the potential significance of the similarity between the harpin and yop export systems is discussed, particularly with respect to a potential role for the yopn homolog in pathogenesis of plants.

TI  == suppression of a sensor kinase-dependent phenotype in pseudomonas syringae by ribosomal proteins l35 and l20.
AB  == the lema gene of pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae encodes the sensor kinase of a bacterial two-component signal transduction system. phenotypes that are lema dependent in p. syringae include lesion formation on bean and production of extracellular protease and the antibiotic syringomycin. recently, the gaca gene has been identified as encoding the response regulator of the lema regulon. to identify additional components that interact with lema, suppressors of a lema mutation were sought. a locus was identified that, when present in multiple copies, restores extracellular protease production to a lema insertion mutant of  p. syringae pv. syringae. this locus was found to encode the p. syringae homologs of translation initiation factor if3 and ribosomal proteins l20 and l35 of escherichia coli and other bacteria. deletion analysis and data from western immunoblots with anti-if3 antiserum suggest that protease restoration does not require if3. deletion of both the l35 and l20 genes resulted in loss of protease  restoration, whereas disruption of either gene alone increased protease restoration. our results suggest that overexpression of either l20 or l35 is sufficient for protease restoration. it is unclear how alteration of ribosomal protein expression compensates in this instance for loss of a transcriptional activator, but a regulatory role for l20 and l35 apart from their function in the ribosome may be indicated.

TI  == analysis of the role of the pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae hrpz harpin in elicitation of the hypersensitive response in tobacco using functionally non-polar hrpz deletion mutations, truncated hrpz fragments, and hrma mutations.
AB  == pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae, like many plant pathogenic bacteria, secretes  a 'harpin' protein that can elicit the hypersensitive response (hr), a defensive  cellular suicide, in non-host plants. the harpin-encoding hrpz gene is located in an operon that also encodes hrp secretion pathway components and is part of the functional cluster of hrp genes carried on cosmid phir11 that enables saprophytic bacteria like escherichia coli and pseudomonas fluorescens to elicit the hr in tobacco leaves. we have constructed functionally non-polar hrpz deletion mutations, revealing that hrpz is necessary for saprophytic bacteria carrying phir11 to elicit a typical hr, whereas it only enhances the elicitation activity  of p. s. syringae. partial deletion mutations revealed that the n-terminal 153 amino acids of hrpz can enable e. coli mc4100-(phir11) to elicit a strong hr. hrpz subclone products comprising the n-terminal 109 amino acids and c-terminal 216 amino acids, respectively, of the 341 amino acid protein were isolated and found to elicit the hr. p. fluorescens (phir11 hrma::tnphoa) mutants do not elicit the hr, but cell fractionation and immunoblot analysis revealed that they  produce and secrete wild-type levels of hrpz. therefore, elicitor activity resides in multiple regions of hrpz, p. syringae produces elicitor(s) in addition to hrpz, and hrpz is essential but not sufficient for hr elicitation by saprophytic bacteria carrying phir11.

TI  == cloning and characterization of the katb gene of pseudomonas aeruginosa encoding  a hydrogen peroxide-inducible catalase: purification of katb, cellular localization, and demonstration that it is essential for optimal resistance to hydrogen peroxide.
AB  == pseudomonas aeruginosa is an obligate aerobe that is virtually ubiquitous in the  environment. during aerobic respiration, the metabolism of dioxygen can lead to the production of reactive oxygen intermediates, one of which includes hydrogen peroxide. to counteract the potentially toxic effects of this compound, p. aeruginosa possesses two heme-containing catalases which detoxify hydrogen peroxide. in this study, we have cloned katb, encoding one catalase gene of p. aeruginosa. the gene was cloned on a 5.4-kb ecori fragment and is composed of 1,539 bp, encoding 513 amino acids. the amino acid sequence of the p. aeruginosa  katb was approximately 65% identical to that of a catalase from a related species, pseudomonas syringae. the katb gene was mapped to the 71- to 75-min region of the p. aeruginosa chromosome, the identical region which harbors both soda and sodb genes encoding both manganese and iron superoxide dismutases. when  cloned into a catalase-deficient mutant of escherichia coli (um255), the recombinant p. aeruginosa katb was expressed (229 u/mg) and afforded this strain  resistance to hydrogen peroxide nearly equivalent to that of the wild-type e. coli strain (hb101). the katb protein was purified to homogeneity and determined  to be a tetramer of approximately 228 kda, which was in good agreement with the predicted protein size derived from the translated katb gene. interestingly, katb was not produced during the normal p. aeruginosa growth cycle, and catalase activity was greater in nonmucoid than in mucoid, alginate-producing organisms. when exposed to hydrogen peroxide and, to a greater extent, paraquat, total catalase activity was elevated 7- to 16-fold, respectively. in addition, an increase in katb activity caused a marked increase in resistance to hydrogen peroxide. katb was localized to the cytoplasm, while kata, the "housekeeping" enzyme, was detected in both cytoplasmic and periplasmic extracts. a p. aeruginosa katb mutant demonstrated 50% greater sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide  than wild-type bacteria, suggesting that katb is essential for optimal resistance of p. aeroginosa to exogenous hydrogen peroxide.

AB  == the nucleotide sequence of the dna replication origin region of a bacteroides vulgatus plasmid, pip417, encoding 5-nitroimidazole resistance has been determined. this region of 1934 bp presents some characteristics similar to those of other replication protein-dependent origins. it contains a large open reading  frame which could encode a basic rep protein (repa) of 36.8 kda. upstream of this orf exist an at-rich region, three direct repeats (iterons) of 21 bp, multiple dnaa binding sites, and sites, and sites for the integration host factor (ihf). moreover, the amino acid sequence of the pip417 repa protein shows similarities with those of other rep proteins encoded by plasmids of gram-negative bacteria: pro1600 from pseudomonas aeruginosa; pps10 from pseudomonas syringae; pfa3 from neisseria gonorrhoeae; and two cryptic plasmids from campylobacter hyointestinalis and butyrivibrio fibrisolvens. although repa can be expressed in  an escherichia coli in vitro transcription-translation assay, vectors containing  the pip417 replication origin did not replicate in e. coli. the homology of the pip417 replication region with the corresponding regions of other bacteroides spp, plasmids was also studied by southern blot hybridization. the results indicated that the repa gene of plasmid pip417 is homologous to that of plasmid pip421, but not of plasmid pip419. the replication region of plasmid pip421 was sequenced and showed about 80% identity at the nucleotide level with that of pip417. a small (3634-bp) cloning vector (pfk12) of entirely defined nucleotide sequence was constructed for bacteroides spp.

TI  == the complete hrp gene cluster of pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae 61 includes two blocks of genes required for harpinpss secretion that are arranged colinearly with yersinia ysc homologs.
AB  == pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae 61 contains a 25-kb hrp cluster that is sufficient to elicit the hypersensitive response (hr) in nonhost plants. previous studies have shown that mutations in complementation groups viii, ix, and xi in the hrp cluster abolished the ability of the bacterium to cause the hr. the sequence of a 3.7-kb smai-ssti fragment covering groups viii and ix now reveals five open reading frames (orfs) in the same transcript, designated as hrpu, hrpw, hrpo, hrpx, and hrpy, and predicted to encode proteins of 14,795, 23,211, 9,381,  28,489, and 39,957 da, respectively. the hrpu, hrpw, hrpo, hrpx, and hrpy genes are homologous and arranged colinearly with the yscq/spa33/spao, yscr/spa24/spap, yscs/spa9/spaq, ysct/spa29/spar, and yscu/spa40/spas genes of yersinia spp., shigella flexneri, and salmonella typhimurium, respectively. these proteins also  show similarity to fli/flh proteins of bacillus and enteric bacteria. the ysc and spa proteins are involved in the secretion of virulence factors, like the yop and ipa proteins. fli/flh proteins are involved in flagellar biogenesis. the sequence of a 2.9-kb ecorv-ecori dna fragment containing mainly group xi revealed five orfs, designated hrpc, hrpd, hrpe, hrpf, and hrpg, predicted to encode proteins of 29,096, 15,184, 21,525, 7,959, and 13,919 da, respectively. the first three genes belong to an operon containing hrpz, which encodes an extracellular protein that elicits the hr. hrpf and hrpg are two potential orfs upstream of hrph in the hrph operon. hrpc is homologous to yersinia yscj, pseudomonas solanacearum hrpi,  xanthomonas compestris pv. vesicatoria hrpb3, and rhizobium fredii nolt. hrpe is  similar to yscl of yersinia spp. p. s. pv. syringae 61 hrp proteins are most similar to ysc proteins among those homologs. tnphoa insertions in hrpc, hrpe, hrpw, hrpx, and hrpy abolished the ability of p. s.pv. syringae 61 to secrete hrpz (harpinpss), as determined by immunoblot analysis of cell-bound and culture  supernatant fractions. thus, many of the proteins required for flagellar biogenesis and virulence protein secretion in plant and animal pathogens may have a common ancestry.

TI  == cloning, characterization and phenotypic expression in escherichia coli of catf,  which encodes the catalytic subunit of catalase isozyme catf of pseudomonas syringae.
AB  == the phytophathogenic, gram-negative bacterium pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae 61 contains three isozymes of catalase (ec 1.11.1.6), which have been proposed to play a role in the bacterium's responses to various environmental stresses. to study the role of individual isozymes, the gene coding for the catalytic subunit  of one catalase isozyme was cloned from a cosmid library hosted in escherichia coli dh5 alpha by using a designed catalase-specific dna probe for the screening. one out of four clones with a catalase-positive genotype was subcloned and a puc19-based 2.7 x 10(3)-base (2.7-kb) insert subclone, pmk3e5, was used to transform catalase-deficient e. coli strain um255 (hpi-, hpii-). the transformants contained a single isozyme of catalase that had electrophoretic and enzymic properties similar to catalase isozyme catf from p. syringae pv. syringae 61. analysis of the sequenced 2.7-kb insert dna revealed six putative open-reading frames (orf). the 1542-base-pair dna sequence of orf2, called catf,  encodes a peptide of 513 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of  66.6 kda. the amino acid sequence deduced from catf had homology to the primary structure of true catalases from mammals, plants, yeasts and bacteria. the activity of the recombinant catalase was inhibited by 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole and  azide and stimulated by chloramphenicol. the n terminus contained a signal sequence of 26 amino acids necessary for secretion into the periplasm, a so-far unique property of pseudomonas catalases.

TI  == erwinia chrysanthemi harpinech: an elicitor of the hypersensitive response that contributes to soft-rot pathogenesis.
AB  == mutants of the soft-rot pathogen erwinia chrysanthemi ec16 that are deficient in  the production of the pectate lyase isozymes pelabce can elicit the hypersensitive response (hr) in tobacco leaves. the hrpnech gene was identified in a collection of cosmids carrying e. chrysanthemi hrp genes by its hybridization with the erwinia amylovora hrpnea gene. hrpnech appears to be in a  monocistronic operon, and it encodes a predicted protein of 340 amino acids that  is glycine-rich, lacking in cysteine, and highly similar to hrpnea in its c-terminal half. escherichia coli dh5 alpha cells expressing hrpnech from the lac promoter of pbluescript ii accumulated hrpnech in inclusion bodies. the protein was readily purified from cell lysates carrying these inclusion bodies by solubilization in 4.5 m guanidine-hcl and reprecipitation upon dialysis against dilute buffer. hrpnech suspensions elicited a typical hr in tobacco leaves, and elicitor activity was heat-stable. tn5-gusa1 mutations were introduced into the cloned hrpnech and then marker-exchanged into the genomes of e. chrysanthemi strains ac4150 (wild type), cucpb5006 (delta pelabce), and cucpb5030 (delta pelabce outd::tnphoa). hrpnech::tn5-gusa1 mutations in cucpb5006 abolished the ability of the bacterium to elicit the hr in tobacco leaves unless complemented with an hrpnech subclone. an hrpnech::tn5-gusa1 mutation also reduced the ability of ac4150 to incite infections in witloof chicory leaves, but it did not reduce the size of lesions that did develop. purified hrpnech and e. chrysanthemi strains cucpb5006 and cucpb5030 elicited hr-like necrosis in leaves of tomato, pepper, african violet, petunia, and pelargonium, whereas hrpnech mutants did not.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == product of fosc, a gene from pseudomonas syringae, mediates fosfomycin resistance by using atp as cosubstrate.
AB  == pseudomonas syringe pb-5123, a producer of fosfomycin, is resistant to high concentrations of the antibiotic. two possible mechanisms of resistance have been detected: (i) impermeability to exogenous fosfomycin, even in the presence of sugar phosphate uptake inducers, and (ii) antibiotic phosphorylation. the gene responsible for this last activity, fosc, encodes a ca. 19,000-da protein and is  immediately followed by a second open reading frame, which shows sequence similarities to glutathione s-transferases. fosc uses atp as a cosubstrate in an  inactivation reaction that can be reversed with alkaline phosphatase. other nucleotide triphosphates cannot be substituted for atp in this reaction. no relationship between fosc and the previously described genes of fosfomycin resistance was found.

TI  == the ice nucleation gene from pseudomonas syringae as a sensitive gene reporter for promoter analysis in zymomonas mobilis.
AB  == the expression of the ice nucleation gene inaz from pseudomonas syringae in zymomonas mobilis strains under the control of three different promoters was investigated to establish the utility of the gene as a reporter and examine the possible use of the organism as a source of ice nuclei for biotechnological applications. a promoterless version of the inaz gene was placed under the control of three different promoters: p(infpdc) (pyruvate decarboxylase), a homologous strong promoter from z. mobilis; p(infbla) ((beta)-lactamase) of plasmid pbr325; and p(infhrpr), the promoter of hrpr, a regulatory gene from p. syringae pv. phaseolicola. the apparent strengths of all three promoters, measured by quantifying the ice nucleation activity at -9 deg c, were lower in z. mobilis than in escherichia coli. the levels of ice nucleation activity expressed under the p(infpdc) promoter were significantly higher than those obtained with the two heterologous promoters in z. mobilis. plasmid pcg4521 (rk2 replicon) gave much lower levels of ice nucleation activity when propagated in strain uvs-51, a  plasmid instability mutant of z. mobilis, compared with the wild-type strain. the ice nucleation activity in z. mobilis cultures showed unusual partitioning in that the culture supernatants obtained after low-speed centrifugation contained the majority of ice nuclei. analysis of the ice nucleation spectra revealed that  the cell pellets contained both "warm" and "cold" nuclei, while the culture supernatant contained primarily cold nuclei, suggesting that the cold nucleus activity may be extracellular. however, all nucleation activity was retained by 0.22-(mu)m-pore-size filters.

TI  == genetic evidence that the gaca gene encodes the cognate response regulator for the lema sensor in pseudomonas syringae.
AB  == mutational analysis of the bean-pathogenic pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae strain b728a has led to the genetic identification of the gaca gene as encoding the response regulator for the unlinked lema sensor kinase. the analysis of a collection of spontaneous mutants of p. syringae pv. syringae suggested that the  gaca gene was involved in lesion formation and the production of protease and syringomycin. the gaca gene originally was identified as a regulator of extracellular antibiotic production by pseudomonas fluorescens, and the predicted gaca protein is a member of the fixj family of bacterial response regulators. the sequence of the putative b728a gaca protein revealed 92% identity with the p. fluorescens gaca protein. an insertional mutation within the p. syringae pv. syringae gaca gene abrogated lesion formation on beans, production of extracellular protease, and production of the toxin syringomycin, the same phenotypes affected by a lema mutation. dna sequence analysis identified the p. syringae pv. syringae uvrc gene immediately downstream of the gaca gene, an arrangement conserved in p. fluorescens and escherichia coli. the gaca insertional mutant was sensitive to uv, presumably because of polarity on transcription of the downstream uvrc gene. southwestern (dna-protein) analysis revealed that the lema and gaca genes were required for the full expression of a  dna binding activity.

TI  == periplasmic glucans of pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae.
AB  == we report the initial characterization of glucans present in the periplasmic space of pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae (strain r32). these compounds were found to be neutral, unsubstituted, and composed solely of glucose. their size ranges from 6 to 13 glucose units/mol. linkage studies and nuclear magnetic resonance analyses demonstrated that the glucans are linked by beta-1,2 and beta-1,6 glycosidic bonds. in contrast to the periplasmic glucans found in other  plant pathogenic bacteria, the glucans of p. syringae pv. syringae are not cyclic but are highly branched structures. acetolysis studies demonstrated that the backbone consists of beta-1,2-linked glucose units to which the branches are attached by beta-1,6 linkages. these periplasmic glucans were more abundant when  the osmolarity of the growth medium was lower. thus, p. syringae pv. syringae appears to synthesize periplasmic glucans in response to the osmolarity of the medium. the structural characteristics of these glucans are very similar to the membrane-derived oligosaccharides of escherichia coli, apart from the neutral character, which contrasts with the highly anionic e. coli membrane-derived oligosaccharides.

AB  == unlike the bacterial pathogens that typically cause the hypersensitive response (hr) in plants, erwinia chrysanthemi has a wide host range, rapidly kills and macerates host tissues, and secretes several isozymes of the macerating enzyme pectate lyase (pel). pelabce- and out- (secretion-deficient) mutants were observed to produce a rapid necrosis in tobacco leaves that was indistinguishable from the hr elicited by the narrow-host-range pathogens e. amylovora ea321 and pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae 61. e. amylovora ea321 hrp genes were used to identify hybridizing cosmids in a cosmid library of e. chrysanthemi ec16 dna in escherichia coli. a 16-kb bamhi fragment in one of these cosmids, pcpp2030, hybridized with e. amylovora hrp genes and was mutagenized with tn10mini-kan. the mutations were introduced into the pelabce- mutant cucpb5006 by marker exchange.  two of the resultant hrp::tn10mini-kan mutations were found to abolish the ability of cucpb5006 to cause any necrosis in tobacco leaves unless complemented  with pcpp2030. these two mutations were also marker-exchanged into the genome of  wild-type strain ac4150. analysis of dna sequences flanking the hrp-2::tn10mini-kan insertion revealed the mutated gene to be similar to a gene in e. amylovora ea321 hrp complementation group viii and to p. s. pv. syringae 61 hrpx. neither of the hrp::tn10mini-kan mutations affected the production or secretion of pectic enzymes by ac4150 or cucpb5006. however, the hrp mutations reduced the ability of both ac4150 and cucpb5006 to incite successful infections  in witloof chicory leaves.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == newer systems for bacterial resistances to toxic heavy metals.
AB  == bacterial plasmids contain specific genes for resistances to toxic heavy metal ions including ag+, aso2-, aso4(3-), cd2+, co2+, cro4(2-), cu2+, hg2+, ni2+, pb2+, sb3+, and zn2+. recent progress with plasmid copper-resistance systems in escherichia coli and pseudomonas syringae show a system of four gene products, an inner membrane protein (pcod), an outer membrane protein (pcob), and two periplasmic cu(2+)-binding proteins (pcoa and pcoc). synthesis of this system is  governed by two regulatory proteins (the membrane sensor pcos and the soluble responder pcor, probably a dna-binding protein), homologous to other bacterial two-component regulatory systems. chromosomally encoded cu2+ p-type atpases have  recently been recognized in enterococcus hirae and these are closely homologous to the bacterial cadmium efflux atpase and the human copper-deficiency disease menkes gene product. the cd(2+)-efflux atpase of gram-positive bacteria is a large p-type atpase, homologous to the muscle ca2+ atpase and the na+/k+ atpases  of animals. the arsenic-resistance system of gram-negative bacteria functions as  an oxyanion efflux atpase for arsenite and presumably antimonite. however, the structure of the arsenic atpase is fundamentally different from that of p-type atpases. the absence of the arsa gene (for the atpase subunit) in gram-positive bacteria raises questions of energy-coupling for arsenite efflux. the arsc protein product of the arsenic-resistance operons of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria is an intracellular enzyme that reduces arsenate [as(v)] to arsenite [as(iii)], the substrate for the transport pump. newly studied cation efflux systems for cd2+, zn2+, and co2+ (czc) or co2+ and ni2+ resistance (cnr) lack atpase motifs in their predicted polypeptide sequences. therefore, not all plasmid-resistance systems that function through toxic ion efflux are atpases. the first well-defined bacterial metallothionein was found in the cyanobacterium  synechococcus. bacterial metallothionein is encoded by the smta gene and contains 56 amino acids, including nine cysteine residues (fewer than animal metallothioneins). the synthesis of synechococcus metallothionein is regulated by a repressor protein, the product of the adjacent but separately transcribed smtb  gene. regulation of metallothionein synthesis occurs at different levels; quickly by derepression of repressor activity, or over a longer time by deletion of the repressor gene at fixed positions and by amplification of the metallothionein dna region leading to multiple copies of the gene.

TI  == purification and characterization of copr, a transcriptional activator protein that binds to a conserved domain (cop box) in copper-inducible promoters of pseudomonas syringae.
AB  == the copper resistance (cop) operon promoter (pcop) of pseudomonas syringae is copper-inducible, and requires the regulatory genes coprs. sequence analysis revealed that copr has significant homology with other known activator proteins from bacterial two-component regulatory systems. in the present study we characterized pcop and its interaction with copr. we found that crude protein extracts from copper-resistant and -sensitive strains of p. syringae contain a pcop-specific dna-binding protein. we hypothesized that this dna-binding protein  was the product of copr. a 27-kda protein, which corresponded to the predicted copr product, was expressed from this gene in escherichia coli. copr was purified, and the first eight amino acids were sequenced to confirm its relationship to copr. specific binding of purified copr to the plasmid-borne pcop and the chromosomally encoded cop homolog promoter (pcoph), identified in this report, was demonstrated using specific and non-specific promoter competitors in  dna mobility shift assays. dnase i footprinting identified a conserved copr binding region (cop box) on pcop and pcoph. the cop box contains an inverted repeat within a stretch of 16 bp, which shares approximately 75% identity with the phob binding region from several phosphate regulon gene promoters in e. coli. primer extension analysis identified the transcriptional initiation site of pcop  59 bp 5' to the translational start site of copa, and the transcriptional initiation site of pcoph 88 bp 5' to the translational start site of the chromosomal homolog of copa. the cop box was localized to between positions -54 and -35 relative to the transcriptional initiation site of pcop and pcoph. deletion analysis of pcop delimited copper-inducible activity to a 104-bp region. pcop and pcoph do not share a sequence consensus with other characterized promoters from p. syrinagae or e. coli. the results presented delineate important regions on two copper-inducible promoters form p. syringae.

AB  == coronamic acid (cma; 2-ethyl-1-aminocyclopropane 1-carboxylic acid) is an intermediate in the biosynthesis of coronatine (cor), a chlorosis-inducing phytotoxin produced by pseudomonas syringae pv. glycinea pg4180. tn5 mutagenesis  and substrate feeding studies were previously used to characterize regions of the cor biosynthetic gene cluster required for synthesis of coronafacic acid and cma, which are the only two characterized intermediates in the cor biosynthetic pathway. in the present study, additional tn5 insertions were generated to more precisely define the region required for cma biosynthesis. a new analytical method for cma detection which involves derivatization with phenylisothiocyanate  and detection by high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc) was developed. this method was used to analyze and quantify the production of cma by selected derivatives of p. syringae pv. glycinea which contained mutagenized or cloned regions from the cma biosynthetic region. pmu2, a clone containing a 6.45-kb insert from the cma region, genetically complemented mutants which required cma for cor production. when pmu2 was introduced into p. syringae pv. glycinea 18a/90 (a strain which does not synthesize cor or its intermediates), cma was not produced, indicating that pmu2 does not contain the complete cma biosynthetic gene cluster. however, when two plasmid constructs designated pmu234 (12.5 kb) and pktx30 (3.0 kb) were cointroduced into 18a/90, cma was detected in culture supernatants by thin-layer chromatography and hplc. the biological activity of the cma produced by p. syringae pv. glycinea 18a/90 derivatives was demonstrated  by the production of cor in cosynthesis experiments in which 18a/90 transconjugants were cocultivated with cma-requiring mutants of p. syringae pv. glycinea pg4180. cma production was also obtained when pmu234 and pktx30 were cointroduced into p. syringae pv. syringae b1; however, these two constructs did  not enable escherichia coli k-12 to synthesize cma. the production of cma in p. syringae strains which lack the cor biosynthetic gene cluster indicates that cma  production can occur independently of coronafacic acid biosynthesis and raises interesting questions regarding the evolutionary origin of the cor biosynthetic pathway.

TI  == characterization of the hrpj and hrpu operons of pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae pss61: similarity with components of enteric bacteria involved in flagellar biogenesis and demonstration of their role in harpinpss secretion.
AB  == the hrp/hrma gene cluster of pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae pss61 has been shown to form a minimum genetic unit sufficient to enable nonpathogenic bacteria, such as escherichia coli, to elicit the hypersensitive response associated with disease resistance. the biochemical functions of most of these genes have not been established. the nucleotide sequence of a 4.3-kb ssti-bglii fragment carrying hrp apparent translational units v, vi, and vii revealed one partial open reading frame (orf) and five complete orfs producing 35,126-, 48,866-, 17,308-, 20,482-, and 26,364-da gene products (hrpj3, j4, j5, u1, u2, respectively). the production of these proteins was confirmed by using t7 rna polymerase-directed expression. the partial orf was found to be identical to the  c terminus of hrpj2. the absence of apparent transcriptional terminators and promoters between hrpi (hrpj2), hrpj3, hrpj4, and hrpj5 together with the observation that the hrpl-dependent hrpj promoter directs expression of hrpj3-j5  indicates that these genes form a single operon controlled by the hrpl-dependent  hrpj promoter. a second hrpl-dependent promoter consensus sequence was also identified upstream of hrpu1 and demonstrated to function as a hrpl-dependent promoter, thus indicating that hrpu1, hrpu2, and additional downstream genes may  be part of a second operon. the deduced product of hrpj3 exhibits similarity to flig of salmonella typhimurium, a cytoplasmic protein that regulates flagellar rotation and biogenesis. hrpj4 shares extensive similarity with the flii family of atpase-like proteins and retains the known functional domains conserved among  this family of proteins. hrpj5 has properties similar to the s. typhimurium flij. neither hrpu1 nor hrpu2 exhibit significant similarity to known proteins. secretion of harpinpss by e. coli mc4100 transformants carrying phir11::tnphoa derivatives was blocked in hrpj4, j5, and u2 mutants. in view of the previously reported similarity of hrpj2 to the lcrd super-family that includes flha, these results predict that the gene products of the hrpj and hrpu operons form an inner membrane complex for translocation of proteins similar to that used by the flagellar biogenesis system of s. typhimurium.

AB  == avirulence gene d (avrd) in strain pt23 of pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (pst)  specifies the production of syringolides, which are elicitors of plant defense reactions. an 83-kb indigenous plasmid (ppt23b) that carries avrd has been mapped and characterized and a putative par region was identified. ppt23b contains a large amount of dna that is repeated in other native plasmids in pt23. a putative mobile insertion element that occurs on plasmid ppt23a as well as on the chromosome was also identified in strain pt23. new broad-host-range expression vectors that functioned in pst were constructed for overexpression of the cloned  avrd gene and high-level production of the syringolides. introduction of an avrd  overexpression plasmid into pt23 or plasmid-cured strains led to identical syringolide peaks on hplc with no new peaks observed. these results suggested that neither ppt23b nor other indigenous plasmids in pst carry additional genes required for syringolide production or metabolism. pst strains lacking ppt23b were not impaired in virulence on tomato plants.

TI  == cloning and sequencing of an ice nucleation active gene of erwinia uredovora.
AB  == an ice nucleation activity gene, named inau, of the bacterium erwinia uredovora kuin-3 has been sequenced. this gene encodes a protein of 1034 amino acid residues, and its expression product, inau protein, has an 832-amino acid residue segment consisting of 52 repeats of closely related 16-amino acid motifs (r-domain), flanked by n- and c-terminal sequences (n- and c-domains, respectively). the primary structure of the inau protein is similar to those of the inaa, inaw, and inaz gene products of erwinia ananas, pseudomonas fluorescens, and pseudomonas syringae, respectively, but is smaller than any of these products in terms of the size of the r-domain.

TI  == a mutation in the indole-3-acetic acid biosynthesis pathway of pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae affects growth in phaseolus vulgaris and syringomycin production.
AB  == homologs of the genes for indole-3-acetic acid (iaa) biosynthesis from pseudomonas syringae pv. savastanoi were retrieved from a genomic library of p. syringae pv. syringae, and their nucleotide sequences were determined. sequence relatedness between the p. syringae pv. syringae and p. syringae pv. savastanoi iaa operons is greater than 90% within the iaam and iaah loci but declines dramatically at a position approximately 200 bp 5' of the iaam translation initiation codon. a third open reading frame was detected downstream of iaah. production of iaa was undetectable in mutant strain y30-53.29, which was generated by transposition of tn5 into the iaam gene of p. syringae pv. syringae  y30. the iaa-deficient (iaa-) mutant retained the ability to colonize the bean phylloplane and induced disease symptoms on bean which were similar to those produced by the parental strain. however, the population dynamics of the iaa- strain during the parasitic phase in leaves differed from those of both the parental strain and the mutant genetically restored for iaa biosynthesis. the mutant was capable of inducing disease symptoms when established in bean tissues  at a lower initial cell density than either iaa-producing strain. syringomycin biosynthesis by the iaa- strain was diminished in comparison with the parental strain or the mutant genetically restored for iaa production. the results indicate that bacterially derived iaa, or its biosynthesis, is involved in the regulation of in planta growth and in the expression of other factors that affect the host-pathogen interaction.

TI  == identification of a putative alternate sigma factor and characterization of a multicomponent regulatory cascade controlling the expression of pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae pss61 hrp and hrma genes.
AB  == the pseudomonas syringae hrp and hrma genes controlling pathogenicity and elicitation of the hypersensitive response and the avr genes controlling host range have been shown previously to be regulated by carbon, nitrogen, ph, osmolarity, and hypothetical plant factors. in p. syringae pv. syringae pss61, inactivation of hrp complementation groups ii and xiii reduced expression of a plasmid-borne hrma'-lacz fusion. the hrp regions ii and xiii were cloned on separate plasmids and shown to enhance the activity of the hrma promoter in escherichia coli mc4100 transformants at least 100-fold. the nucleotide sequence  of region xiii revealed two open reading frames (hrpr and hrps) whose deduced products share homology with p. syringae pv. phaseolicola nps3121 hrps and are both related to the ntrc family of two-component signal transduction systems. hrpr and hrps differ from most members of the protein family by lacking an amino-terminal domain which modulates the regulatory activity. a single open reading frame, hrpl, whose product shares homology with algu, a putative alternate sigma factor of p. aeruginosa, as well as with the related alternate sigma factors was identified within region ii. key domains are partially conserved. inactivation of hrps in pss61 repressed expression of a plasmid-borne  hrpl'-lacz fusion carried by pyxpl1r, and transformation of mc4100(pyxpl1r) with  a plasmid carrying hrprs increased hrpl promoter activity at least 200-fold. neither hrps nor hrpr, when cloned on separate plasmids, activated the hrpl promoter activity individually. the expression of hrpl when directed by a lac promoter was sufficient to express a set of plasmid-borne hrma'-, hrpj'-, and hrpz'-lacz fusions independently of other hrp genes. the results indicate that hrprs and hrpl are part of a regulatory cascade in which hrpr and hrps activate expression of hrpl and hrpl, a putative sigma factor, induces expression of hrpl-responsive genes.

TI  == amino acid residues required for the activity of avrd alleles.
AB  == certain pseudomonas syringae pathovars harbor avrd alleles belonging to two different homology classes. the nonfunctional avrd allele of p. s. pv. glycinea is highly homologous to active class ii avrd alleles but has five unique amino acid substitutions. three of these five amino acid changes were shown to be absolutely required for restoration of avrd activity to the p. s. pv. glycinea allele by oligonucleotide site-directed mutagenesis. they were cysteine 19 to arginine, alanine 280 to valine, and leucine 304 to serine. in addition, changing leucine 301 to phenylalanine was required for high activity. however, alteration  of the leucine at position 245 of the p. s. pv. glycinea allele to serine, present in the active alleles, did not affect avrd activity. results from recombinant gene constructs between the nonfunctional p. s. pv. glycinea avrd gene and the functional allele from p. s. pv. phaseolicola identified six other amino acid residues that may form contextual motifs important for avrd function.  these were a four amino acid stretch comprised of glutamate 41, alanine 42, asparagine 43 and arginine 44 in addition to aspartate 243 and phenylalanine 301. some divergence is tolerated within the four amino acid motif, but phenylalanine  301 appears to be necessary for highly active class ii avrd proteins.

TI  == hrpi of erwinia amylovora functions in secretion of harpin and is a member of a new protein family.
AB  == hrpi, a 78-kda protein, functions in the secretion of harpin, a proteinaceous elicitor of the hypersensitive response from erwinia amylovora. the predicted amino acid sequence of hrpi is remarkably similar to that of lcrd of yersinia species, the first member of a recently described protein family. other proteins  of the family are mixa from shigella flexneri, inva from salmonella typhimurium,  flha from caulobacter crescentus, hrpi from pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae, hrpo from pseudomonas solanacearum, and hrpc2 from xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria. cells of e. amylovora containing mutated hrpi genes or cells of escherichia coli containing the cloned hrp gene cluster with mutated hrpi produce but do not export harpin. when similar cells with functional hrpi genes were grown at 25 degrees c, but not at 37 degrees c, harpin was exported to the culture supernatant. direct evidence that hrpi is involved in the secretion of a  virulence protein has been offered. two other loci of the hrp gene cluster are involved in the regulation of harpin, and four other loci also are involved in the secretion of harpin. since harpin and other proteins likely to be secreted by the lcrd family of proteins lack typical signal peptides, their secretion mechanism is distinct from the general protein export pathway.

TI  == changes in cultivar-specificity toward pea can result from transfer of plasmid rp4 and other incompatibility group p1 replicons to pseudomonas syringae pv. pisi.
AB  == transfer of rp4 and related replicons belonging to the escherichia coli incompatibility group p (pseudomonas aeruginosa incp1) to races 2 and 6 of p. syringae pv. pisi was associated with the creation of two types of transconjugant, one resembling the parental race and the other showing an altered cultivar-specificity towards pea. the latter, irrespective of the parental race,  exhibited a novel pattern of interaction with pea that corresponded to race 4; consequently such transconjugants were termed race 4-like. curing of rp4 did not  affect the phenotype, except in relation to the antibiotic resistances specified  by rp4. the race 4-like strains were non-fluorescent when cultured on appropriate media (in contrast to the particular isolates of races 2 and 6 from which they were derived), showed an enhanced ability to inherit rp4 subsequently (at frequencies up to 10(-1) per recipient) and differed from their parental race in  their pattern of plasmid profile. the plasmid profiles were similar for all race  4-like strains irrespective of origin. there was no evidence that rp4 had recombined with dna in the recipient and probing failed to detect the retention of any part of rp4 in cured strains. the inheritance of the related cosmid vector, plafr3, had similar effects in races 2 and 6. this observation is important since this vector has been widely used to clone avirulence genes in plant pathogenic bacteria. transfer of the incw plasmids s-a and r388 did not cause any changes in the fluorescence or cultivar-specificity of races 2 or 6.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == homology between a genetic locus (mdoa) involved in the osmoregulated biosynthesis of periplasmic glucans in escherichia coli and a genetic locus (hrpm) controlling pathogenicity of pseudomonas syringae.
AB  == membrane-derived oligosaccharides (mdo) of escherichia coli are representative members of a family of glucans found in the periplasmic space of gram-negative bacteria. the two genes forming the mdogh operon are necessary for the synthesis  of mdo. the nucleotide sequence (4759 bp) and the transcriptional start of this operon were determined. both gene products were further characterized by gene fusion analysis. mdog is a 56 kda periplasmic protein whose function remains to be determined. mdoh, whose presence was shown to be necessary for normal glucosyl transferase activity, is a 97 kda protein spanning the cytoplasmic membrane. to our surprise, these proteins are not homologous to the periplasmic glucan biosynthetic enzymes previously characterized in the rhizobiaceae family. however, a considerable homology (69% identical nucleotides out of 2816) was discovered between mdogh and the two genes present at the hrpm locus of the phytopathogenic bacterium pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae. functions of these genes remain mysterious but they are known to be required for both the expression of disease symptoms on host plants and the development of the hypersensitive reaction on non-host plants (mills and mukhopadhyay, 1990). these results confirm the importance of periplasmic glucans for the physiological ecology of gram-negative bacteria.

AB  == the hrma locus, isolated from pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae 61, is essential  for phenotypic expression of the p. s. pv. syringae 61 hrp cluster in escherichia coli strains and enables bacteria carrying the hrp/hrm gene cluster to elicit the hypersensitive response (hr) associated with plant disease resistance. the phenotype of p. s. pv syringae 61 hrma mutants (pathogenicity+, delayed hr) was distinct from that of hrp mutants. the locus was localized to a 3.6-kb bamh1-ecor1 fragment whose nucleotide sequence was determined. a single open reading frame was identified that encodes for a 41,457-da protein of unknown biochemical function. production of the deduced protein product was confirmed by  using t7 rna polymerase-directed expression of the locus and n-terminal sequence  analysis of the isolated hrma. the deduced protein product did not exhibit homology with any of the characterized avr genes or the hrpn product of erwinia amylovora. transcription was shown to initiate 37 nucleotides upstream of the translational start from an apparent sigma 70 promoter. two hrp genes were shown  to act as positive transcriptional factors for hrma expression. expression of hrma in p. syringae pv. glycinea race 4 did not exhibit the phenotypic properties of an avr gene or hrpn, but suggested that this locus may serve a regulatory function. a homolog to hrma was present in strains of only three of the 23 p. syringae pathovars tested.

TI  == characterization of chromosomal homologs of the plasmid-borne copper resistance operon of pseudomonas syringae.
AB  == copper-resistant and copper-sensitive strains of pseudomonas syringae, as well as many other pseudomonads, contain chromosomal dna homologous to the plasmid-borne  copper resistance operon (copabcd). cop homologs were cloned from the chromosome  of p. syringae pv. tomato pt12.2, which had an elevated level of resistance to copper compared with typical copper-sensitive strains of other p. syringae pathovars and showed an unusually high frequency of spontaneous mutation to high  levels of copper resistance. two chromosomal cop homolog regions were cloned. homolog 1 hybridized with copa and copb, and homolog 2 hybridized with copa, copb, copc, and the copper-responsive regulatory genes coprs. homolog 1 had no detectable function when transferred to a copper-sensitive strain of p. syringae. however, homolog 2 conferred the low level of copper resistance observed with pt12.2 and produced proteins related to copa and copc. in addition, homolog 2 conferred a high frequency of mutation to full copper resistance. in a spontaneously mutated derivative of the cloned homolog 2 (pcoph2r) that conferred copper resistance, an increased level of copa was observed. pcoph2r also supported a higher level of transcriptional activity of the cop promoter that was fused to lacz and provided in trans (pcop38), suggesting that the spontaneous mutation was regulatory, probably involving the coprs homologs. homolog 2 was similar but not identical to the plasmid-borne cop operon, and it did not complement site-specific mutations in cop genes.

TI  == a two-component regulatory system required for copper-inducible expression of the copper resistance operon of pseudomonas syringae.
AB  == specific induction of the copper resistance operon (cop) promoter from pseudomonas syringae was measured by beta-galactosidase production from a cop promoter-lacz fusion. induction of the cop promoter in p. syringae pv. syringae required trans-acting factors from copper resistance plasmid ppt23d, from which cop was originally cloned. tn5 mutagenesis of ppt23d was used to localize two complementation groups immediately downstream from copabcd. cloning and sequencing of the dna in this region revealed two genes, copr and cops, expressed in the same orientation as the cop operon but from a separate constitutive promoter. the amino acid sequence deduced from these genes showed distinct similarities to known two-component regulatory systems, including phob-phor and ompr-envz. in addition, copr showed strong similarity to copper resistance activator protein pcor from escherichia coli. functional chromosomal homologs to  coprs activated the cop promoter, in a copper-inducible manner, in copper-resistant or -sensitive strains of p. syringae pv. tomato and other pseudomonas species. this implies that copper-inducible gene regulation is associated with a common chromosomally encoded function, as well as plasmid-borne copper resistance, in pseudomonas spp.

TI  == suppression of bean defense responses by pseudomonas syringae.
AB  == we have developed a model system to examine suppression of defense responses in bean by the compatible bacterium pseudomonas syringae pv phaseolicola. previously, we have shown that there is a general mechanism for the induction of  the bean defense genes phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (pal), chalcone synthase (chs), chalcone isomerase (chi), and chitinase (cht) by incompatible, compatible, and nonpathogenic bacteria. here, we show that bean plants infiltrated with isolates of p. s. phaseolicola failed to produce transcripts for pal, chs, or chi up to 120 hr after infiltration and cht transcript accumulation was significantly delayed when compared to the incompatible p. syringae strains. infiltration of bean plants with 108 cells per ml of p. s. phaseolicola nps3121 8 hr prior to infiltration with an equal concentration of incompatible p. s. pv tabaci pt11528  significantly reduced the typical profile of defense transcript accumulation when compared to plants infiltrated with pt11528 alone. a corresponding suppression of phytoalexin accumulation was also observed. nps3121 also suppressed pal, chs, chi, and cht transcript accumulation and phytoalexin production induced by escherichia coli dh5[alpha] or the elicitor glutathione. heat-killed nps3121 cells or cells treated with protein synthesis inhibitors lost the suppressor activity. taken together, these experiments suggest that nps3121 has an active mechanism to suppress the accumulation of defense transcripts and phytoalexin biosynthesis in bean.

TI  == generalized induction of defense responses in bean is not correlated with the induction of the hypersensitive reaction.

AB  == the hrp gene cluster of pseudomonas solanacearum gmi1000 strain encodes functions that are essential for pathogenicity on tomato and for the elicitation of the hypersensitive response on tobacco. in this study, we present the nucleotide sequence of one of the hrp genes (hrpb) located at the left-hand end of the cluster and we show that hrpb encodes a positive regulator controlling the expression of hrp genes. hrpb has a coding capacity for a 477-amino-acid polypeptide, which shows significant similarity to several prokaryotic transcriptional activators including the arac protein of escherichia coli, the xyls protein of pseudomonas putida and the virf protein of yersinia enterocolitica. the predicted hrpb gene product belongs to a family of bacterial  regulators different from the previously described hrps protein of the hrp gene cluster of pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola. genetic evidence demonstrates that the hrpb gene product acts as a positive regulator of the expression in minimal medium of all but one of the putative transcription units of the hrp gene cluster and also controls the expression of genes located outside this cluster. we also show in this paper that the transcription of hrpb is induced in minimal medium and is partly autoregulated.

TI  == multiple periplasmic catalases in phytopathogenic strains of pseudomonas syringae.
AB  == phytopathogenic strains of pseudomonas syringae are exposed to plant-produced, detrimental levels of hydrogen peroxide during invasion and colonization of host  plant tissue. when p. syringae strains were investigated for their capacity to resist h2o2, they were found to contain 10- to 100-fold-higher levels of total catalase activity than selected strains belonging to nonpathogenic related taxa (pseudomonas fluorescens and pseudomonas putida) or escherichia coli. multiple catalase activities were identified in both periplasmic and cytoplasmic fluids of exponential- and stationary-phase p. syringae cells. two of these activities were unique to the periplasm of p. syringae pv. glycinea. during the stationary growth phase, the specific activity of cytoplasmic catalases increased four- to eightfold. the specific activities of catalases in both fluids from exponential-phase cells increased in response to treatment with 0.25 to 10 mm h2o2 but decreased when higher h2o2 concentrations were used. in stationary-growth phase cultures, the specific activities of cytoplasmic catalases increased remarkably after treatment with 0.25 to 50 mm h2o2. the growth of p. syringae into stationary phase and h2o2 treatment did not induce synthesis of additional catalase isozymes. only the stationary-phase cultures of  all of the p. syringae strains which we tested were capable of surviving high h2o2 stress at concentrations up to 50 mm. our results are consistent with the involvement of multiple catalase isozymes in the reduction of oxidative stress during plant pathogenesis by these bacteria.

AB  == pseudomonas viridiflava is a soft-rotting pathogen of harvested vegetables that produces an extracellular pectate lyase (pl) responsible for maceration of plant  tissue. a pel gene encoding pl was cloned from the genome of strain sj074 and efficiently expressed in escherichia coli. after a series of deletion subclonings and analysis by transposon mutagenesis, the pel gene was located in a 1.2-kb psti-bglii genomic fragment. this fragment appears to contain a promoter at the psti end required for pel gene expression. the pl produced by pectolytic e. coli  clones is identical to those produced by strain sj074 and by other strains of p.  viridiflava in terms of molecular weight (42 kda) and pi (9.7). a mutant of strain sj074, designated mei, which had tn5 specifically inserted in the pel locus was constructed by site-directed mutagenesis. the mei mutant produced 70- to 100-fold less pl than the wild type and failed to cause tissue maceration in plants. pl production and soft-rot pathogenicity in mei and in a pel- mutant previously isolated from strain sf312 were restored to the wild-type level by complementation in trans with the cloned pel gene. by using the 1.2-kb fragment as a probe, pel homologs were detected in four bacteria that are pathologically unrelated to p. viridiflava. these include three pathovars of p. syringae (pv. lachrymans, pv. phaseolicola, and pv. tabaci) and xanthomonas campestris pv. malvacearum. no dna fragments showing homology to pel of p. viridiflava were detected in genomic digests prepared from two strains of soft-rot erwinias.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == signal transduction in exopolysaccharide alginate synthesis: phosphorylation of the response regulator algr1 in pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli.
AB  == synthesis of alginate by pseudomonas aeruginosa correlates with its pathogenicity in the lungs of patients suffering from cystic fibrosis (cf). alginate synthesis-encoding genes (alg) in p. aeruginosa are normally silent, but are specifically triggered in the cf lung environment. the promoter for the algd gene, located at the upstream end of the alg cluster, is activated by environmental factors such as high osmolarity, nutrient limitation and dehydration. several regulatory proteins are known to control transcription from  the algd promoter. among these proteins is algr1 which is homologous to the phosphorylation-dependent response regulators of the two-component signal transduction system. in this paper, we report that algr2, an 18-kda protein which in cooperation with algr1 regulates the algd promoter, undergoes phosphorylation  in the presence of atp. the phosphate group acquired by algr2 is then transferred to algr1. in addition, we show that algr1 can be phosphorylated by an algr2-analog in escherichia coli. algr1 is isolated in a phosphorylatable 80-kda  complex in association with algr2 in p. aeruginosa and the algr2-analog in e. coli.

TI  == phenotypic expression of the pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae 61 hrp/hrm gene cluster in escherichia coli mc4100 requires a functional porin.
AB  == plants, in general, appear to be able to detect the presence of incompatible pseudomonas syringae strains by a hypothetical cell-cell recognition process to initiate inducible defense mechanisms that contribute to disease resistance. a 25-kb hrp/hrm gene cluster isolated from p. syringae pv. syringae 61(phir11) enables escherichia coli to elicit a hypersensitive response (hr), a plant response generally considered to be a manifestation of recognition and resistance. to identify the nature of the hr-eliciting signal produced by e. coli cells carrying phir11, bacterial surface features were surveyed by immunological  and biochemical procedures. no immunoreactive epitopes or outer membrane proteins were detected that were associated with expression of the p. syringae pv. syringae 61 hrp/hrm cluster in e. coli mc4100. phenotypic expression of the p. syringae pv. syringae 61 hrp/hrm cluster in e. coli mc4100, however, was found to be dependent upon ompc and ompf, which control outer membrane permeability to hydrophilic solutes. the results suggest that deployment of the hr-eliciting signal occurs via outer membrane porins and imply that a low-molecular-weight, hydrophilic factor mediates signal exchange between the bacterium and the responding plant cell.

TI  == dna sequence of is91 and identification of the transposase gene.
AB  == is91 is a 1,830-bp insertion sequence that inserts specifically at the sequence caag or gaac of the target and does not duplicate any sequence upon insertion (23). by transposon mutagenesis, we have identified open reading frame 426 (orf426; bp 454 to 1731) as the putative orf for the transposase. it displays a cysteine-rich, potential metal-binding domain in its n-terminal region. adjacent  to orf426, there is an orf (orf121) which precedes and terminally overlaps orf426 by one amino acid. tn1732 insertions in orf121 do not affect the transposition frequency. is91 has sequence similarities to is801 from pseudomonas syringae. their putative transposases are 36% identical, including conservation of the cysteine-rich cluster. the information concerning is801 insertion specificity and target duplication has been reevaluated in the light of our results.

TI  == construction of a transducing virus from double-stranded rna bacteriophage phi6:  establishment of carrier states in host cells.
AB  == bacteriophage phi 6 contains three double-stranded rna (dsrna) genomic segments.  we have constructed a plasmid that contains a cdna copy of the middle (m) segment, with a gene for kanamycin resistance (kan) inserted into the psti site.  a transcript of this cdna was incorporated in vitro into procapsids along with natural transcripts of the s and l segments. the procapsids were coated with nucleocapsid surface protein p8 and transfected into pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola. the resulting infectious virus, phi 6 k1, was found to contain an m segment that was 1.2 kbp larger than the normal 4.1 kbp. k1 formed small, turbid  plaques, and its genome was unstable. preparations of k1 contained from about 0.1 to 10% large, clear-plaque forms of the virus which were usually missing the kan  gene, and in some cases, the resulting segment m was smaller than its normal size. cells picked from lawns of host cells infected with k1 yielded colonies that were resistant to kanamycin (kan). these colonies could be passaged on kanamycin-containing medium. the cells were found to contain large amounts of dsrna corresponding to the viral genomic segments. some strains continued to produce viable phage, while others lost this ability. one strain completely lost  the small genomic segment s. approximately 1 in 10,000 infected cells acquired the carrier state with the original phage isolate k1. however, we isolated a viral mutant that was able to induce the carrier state in 10 to 20% of the infected cells. the ability to use drug resistance as a test for the carrier state makes this system very useful for the study of the mechanisms of induction  of persistent infections.

AB  == five bacterial species were transformed using particle gun-technology. no pretreatment of cells was necessary. physical conditions (helium pressure, target cell distance and gap distance) and biological conditions (cell growth phase, osmoticum concentration, and cell density) were optimized for biolistic transformation of escherichia coli and these conditions were then used to successfully transform agrobacterium tumefaciens, erwinia amylovora, erwinia stewartii and pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae. transformation rates for e. coli were 10(4) per plate per 0.8 micrograms dna. although transformation rates for the other species were low (less than 10(2) per plate per 0.8 micrograms dna), successful transformation without optimization for each species tested suggests wide utility of biolistic transformation of prokaryotes. e. coli has proven to be a useful model system to determine the effects of relative humidity, particle size and particle coating on efficiency of biolistic transformation.

TI  == formation of bacterial membrane ice-nucleating lipoglycoprotein complexes.
AB  == the preliminary finding that nonprotein additions to the protein product of the ice-nucleating gene of pseudomonas syringae or erwinia herbicola are essential for ice nucleation at the warmest temperatures has led to experiments aimed at identifying possible linkages between the ice protein and the other components. it appears that the protein is coupled to various sugars through n- and o-glycan  linkages. mannose residues are apparently bound via an n-glycan bond to the amide nitrogen of one or more of the three essential asparagine residues in the unique  amino-terminal portion of the protein. in turn, these mannose residues are involved in the subsequent attachment of phosphatidylinositol to the nucleation structure. this phosphatidylinositol-mannose-protein structure is the critical element in the class a nucleating structure. in addition to sugars attached to the asparagine residues, additional sugar residues appear to be attached by o-glycan linkages to serine and threonine residues in the primary repeating octapeptide, which makes up 70% of the total ice protein. these additional sugar  residues include galactose and glucosamine and most likely additional mannose residues. these conclusions were based on (i) the changes in ice-nucleating activity due to the action of n- and o-glycanases, alpha- and beta-mannosidoses,  and beta-galactosidase; (ii) immunoblot analyses of ice proteins in cell extracts after enzyme treatments; and (iii) the properties of transformed ice+ escherichia coli cells containing plasmids with defined amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal  deletions in the ice gene. finally, evidence is presented that these sugar residues may play a role in aggregating the ice gene lipoglycoprotein compound into larger aggregates, which are the most effective ice nucleation structures.

TI  == components of ice nucleation structures of bacteria.
AB  == nonprotein components attached to the known protein product of the inaz gene of pseudomonas syringae have been identified and shown to be necessary for the most  efficient ice nucleation of supercooled h2o. previous studies have shown that cultures of ina+ bacteria have cells with three major classes of ice-nucleating structures with readily differentiated activities. further, some cells in the culture have nucleating activities intermediate between those of the different classes and presumably have structures that are biosynthetic intermediates between those of the different classes. since these structures cannot be readily  isolated and analyzed, their components have been identified by the use of specific enzymes or chemical probes, by direct incorporation of labeled precursors, and by stimulation of the formation of specific classes of freezing structures by selective additions to the growth medium. from these preliminary studies it appears that the most active ice nucleation structure (class a) contains the ice nucleation protein linked to phosphatidylinositol and mannose, probably as a complex mannan, and possibly glucosamine. these nonprotein components are characteristic of those used to anchor external proteins to cell membranes of eucaryotic cells and suggest that a similar but not identical anchoring mechanism is required for efficient ice nucleation structure. the class b structure has been found to contain protein presumably linked to the mannan and glucosamine moieties but definitely not to the phosphatidylinositol. the class c  structure, which has the poorest ice nucleation activity, appears to be the ice nucleation protein linked to a few mannose residues and to be partially imbedded  in the outer cell membrane.

TI  == anaerobic growth and cyanide synthesis of pseudomonas aeruginosa depend on anr, a regulatory gene homologous with fnr of escherichia coli.
AB  == anaerobic growth of pseudomonas aeruginosa on nitrate or arginine requires the anr gene, which codes for a positive control element (anr) capable of functionally complementing an fnr mutation in escherichia coli. the anr gene was  sequenced; it showed 51% identity with the fnr gene at the amino acid sequence level. four cysteine residues known to be essential in the fnr protein are conserved in anr. the anr gene product (deduced mr 27,129) was visualized by the  maxicell method and migrated like a 32 kda protein in gel electrophoresis under denaturing conditions. an anr mutant of p. aeruginosa constructed by gene replacement was defective in nitrate respiration, arginine deiminase activity, and hydrogen cyanide biosynthesis, underscoring the diverse metabolic functions of anr during oxygen limitation. pseudomonas fluorescens, pseudomonas putida, pseudomonas syringae, and pseudomonas mendocina all had a functional analogue of  anr, indicating that similar anaerobic control mechanisms exist in these bacteria.

AB  == a broad host-range expression plasmid was constructed comprising the incq replicon, the reca promoter from escherichia coli and the g10-l ribosome binding  site (rbs) derived from bacteriophage t7. the structural genes for porcine somatotropin (pst) and e. coli beta-galactosidase (lacz) were used to monitor gene expression in a diverse collection of gram-negative bacterial hosts: escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas syringae, pseudomonas putida, pseudomonas fluorescens, pseudomonas testosteroni, serratia marcescens and erwinia herbicola. the e. coli reca promoter was functional in this wide range of hosts and was inducible by the addition of nalidixic acid. moreover, the level of lacz expression was often at least as high as that observed in e. coli.  previous studies had shown that the g10-l rbs was superior to a simple "consensus" rbs sequence for expression of foreign genes in e. coli. here we demonstrate a 38 to 70 fold increase in expression in two pseudomonas hosts using the g10-l rbs, indicating that the translational enhancer present in the g10-l rbs is also functional in other bacteria. the juxtaposition of these transcriptional and translational elements in a broad host-range vector provides  a simple way to evaluate alternate hosts for recombinant protein production.

TI  == purification of the regulatory protein algr1 and its binding in the far upstream  region of the algd promoter in pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  == a regulatory protein algr1, previously suggested to be a member of a two-component sensory transduction system because of its homology to ompr and ntrc and its ability to allow activation of the algd promoter under conditions of high osmolarity, has been hyperproduced in escherichia coli after deletion of the upstream region including part of the shine-dalgarno sequence of the algr1 gene and its subsequent cloning under the tac promoter. the algr1 protein is purified  as a monomer, and the sequence of the nine n-terminal amino acids of the monomer  matches with that predicted from the dna sequence of the algr1 gene. the purified algr1 protein binds to two separate dna fragments of the algd upstream region. dnase protection experiments identify these two dna segments as 14-mer sequences  centered at -382 and -458 regions, which contain a common ccgt-tcgtc sequence in  them. while the presence of at least one algr1 binding site is important for the  activation of the algd promoter, the presence of both of the binding sites in the upstream region leads to a higher level of activation.

TI  == phosphatidylinositol, a phospholipid of ice-nucleating bacteria.
AB  == the nature of the phospholipids of the various bacteria that have ice nucleation  activity in supercooled water has been determined. the seven bacteria studied included pseudomonas syringae, erwinia herbicola, three escherichia coli k-12 strains that are phenotypically ice+ because they contain plasmids with different amounts of either p. syringae or e. herbicola cloned dna, and two e. coli k-12 strains without cloned ice gene dna. all five ice+ bacterial strains contained small amounts (0.1 to 1.0% of the total phospholipids) of phosphatidylinositol (pi), a phospholipid not previously detected in e. coli, pseudomonas, or erwinia  species. the ice- e. coli strains also contained trace level of pi that amounted  to 2 to 30% of the level found in the ice+ e. coli strains. extracts of ice+ strains contained low but measurable activities of pi synthase, while the activities in ice- strains amounted to only 8 to 12% or less of that found in extracts of ice+ bacteria. the functioning of the ice gene apparently increased both the pi synthase activity and the pi content of ice+ strains from low endogenous levels. the relative ice nucleation activity at -4 degrees c or above  (class a nucleation activity) of all ice+ strains was found to be proportional to their pi content. the addition of myo-inositol (5 x 10(-4) m) to synthetic culture media increased the class a nucleation activity of both ice+ e. coli strains and p. syringae up to sevenfold but had no stimulating effect on ice nucleation at lower temperatures (class b and class c nucleation activities). if  these cells after fusion with pi vesicles were incubated with an energy source, the class a nucleation activity increased 70-fold over that present before fusion. these results indicate that pi plays an important role in ice nucleation  at warm temperatures and is a likely precursor or component of the class a structure.

TI  == nolc, a rhizobium fredii gene involved in cultivar-specific nodulation of soybean, shares homology with a heat-shock gene.
AB  == rhizobium fredii strain usda257 does not nodulate soybean (glycine max (l.) merr.) cultivar mccall. mutant 257dh5, which contains a tn5 insert in the bacterial chromosome, forms nodules on this cultivar, but acetylene-reduction activity is absent. we have sequenced the region corresponding to the site of tn5 insertion in this mutant and find that it lies within a 1176bp open reading frame that we designate nolc. nolc encodes a protein of deduced molecular weight 43564. nucleotide sequences homologous to nolc are present in several other rhizobium strains, as well as agrobacterium tumefaciens, but not in pseudomonas syringae pathovar glycinea. nolc lacks significant sequence homology with known genes that function in nodulation, but is 61% homologous to dnaj, an escherichia coli gene that encodes a 41 kda heat-shock protein. both r. fredii usda257 and mutant 257dh5 produce heat-shock proteins of 78, 70, 22, and 16kda. a 4.3kb ecori-hindiii subclone containing nolc expresses a single 43kda polypeptide in mini-cells. a longer, 9.4kb ecori fragment expresses both the 43kda polypeptide and a 78kda polypeptide that corresponds in size to that of the largest heat-shock protein. thus, although nolc has strong sequence homology to dnaj and  appears to be linked to another heat-shock gene, it does not directly function in the heat-shock response.

AB  == the streptomycin resistance gene of pseudomonas syringae pv. papulans psp36 was cloned into escherichia coli and used to develop a 500-bp dna probe that is specific for streptomycin resistance in p. syringae pv. papulans. the probe is a  portion of a 1-kb region shared by three different dna clones of the resistance gene. in southern hybridizations, the probe hybridized only with dna isolated from streptomycin-resistant strains of p. syringae pv. papulans and not with the  dna of streptomycin-sensitive strains. transposon insertions within the region of dna shared by the three clones resulted in loss of resistance to streptomycin. colony hybridization of bacteria isolated from apple leaves and orchard soil indicated that 39% of 398 streptomycin-resistant bacteria contained dna that hybridized to the probe. these included all strains of p. syringae pv. papulans and some other fluorescent pseudomonads and nonfluorescent gram-negative bacteria, but none of the gram-positive bacteria. the same-size restriction fragments hybridized to the probe in p. syringae pv. papulans. restriction fragment length polymorphism of this region was occasionally observed in strains  of other taxonomic groups of bacteria. in bacteria other than p. syringae pv. papulans, the streptomycin resistance probe hybridized to different-sized plasmids and no relationship between plasmid size and taxonomic group or between  plasmid size and orchard type, soil association, or leaf association could be detected.

TI  == a series of wide-host-range low-copy-number vectors that allow direct screening for recombinants.
AB  == a series of controlled expression vectors was constructed based on the wide-host-range plasmid pmmb66eh. some of these new vectors code for the alpha-peptide of beta-galactosidase and allow the direct screening of recombinant clones by inactivation of alpha-complementation. the bla gene was replaced in some plasmids by the cat gene of tn9 coding for chloramphenicol resistance, extending the use into beta-lactam-resistant strains. they all feature either the tac or taclac (tac-lac uv5 in tandem) promoters in front of a polylinker followed by the rrnb transcriptional stop point. these vectors were tested by subcloning the xyle gene coding for the pseudomonas putida catechol 2,3-oxygenase and the escherichia coli lamb gene coding for the lambda receptor. the expression of these genes in e. coli indicated that the tac promoter is five times stronger than the taclac promoter and that both were tightly regulated. the tac promoter in pseudomonas syringae pv glycinea and xanthomonas campestris pv vesicatoria had a strength similar to that in e. coli, while the taclac promoter was much weaker, reaching only 6.5 and 3% of the level of expression of the tac promoter, respectively. the taclac promoter, however, proved to be useful for the cloning in e. coli of dna fragments that were unstable in vectors with stronger promoters and higher copy number. expression of the lamb gene in vibrio cholerae strain trh7000 was not sufficient to permit cosmid transduction. two subunits of the e.  coli mannose permease, coded by the ptsp and ptsm genes, are also required for cosmid dna penetration into the recipient cells.

AB  == the hrp cluster of pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola encodes functions that are essential for pathogenicity on bean plants and for the elicitation of the hypersensitive response on resistant plants. the cluster was saturated with insertions of transposon tn3-spice that served both as a mutagen and as a sensitive reporter of the expression of the target regions. the mutations covered a 17.5-kb segment in strain nps3121, in which seven hrp::tn5 insertions had been  previously mapped, and regions outside this segment. the cluster is organized into seven distinct complementation groups (hrpl, hrpab, hrpc, hrpd, hrpe, hrpf,  and hrpsr) on the basis of the analysis of over 100 tn3-spice insertions in plasmids and 43 similar insertions in the chromosome; it spans nearly 22 kb and is chromosomally located. the transcriptional orientation of all genes in the cluster was established by measuring the level of ice nucleation activity of complemented merodiploids carrying chromosomal hrp::inaz fusions after inoculation in red kidney bean leaves. although all seven loci were actively expressed in red kidney bean leaves, none of them was substantially expressed when the bacteria were grown in king b broth medium. mutations in all loci, except those in hrpc, greatly reduced the ability of the bacteria to multiply in  bean leaves. mutations in the hrpc locus, although preventing the bacteria from eliciting a hypersensitive reaction on tobacco, allowed the bacteria to produce delayed and attenuated symptoms in red kidney bean leaves and to multiply to a level 10(2)- to 10(3)-fold lower than that of the wild-type strain. this is the first comprehensive report of the genetic and transcriptional organization of the hrp gene cluster in a phytopathogenic bacterium.

AB  == injection into tobacco leaves of biotype 1 agrobacterium tumefaciens or of pseudomonas savastanoi inhibited the development of a visible hypersensitive response to the subsequent injection at the same site of pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola. this interference with the hypersensitive response was not seen with injection of bacterial growth medium or escherichia coli cells. live a. tumefaciens cells were required for the inhibitory effect. various mutants and strains of a. tumefaciens were examined to determine the genes involved. known chromosomal mutations generally had no effect on the ability of a. tumefaciens to inhibit the hypersensitive response, except for chvb mutants which showed a reduced (but still significant) inhibition of the hypersensitive response. ti plasmid genes appeared to be required for the inhibition of the hypersensitive response. the bacteria did not need to be virulent in order to inhibit the hypersensitive response. deletion of the vir region from pti had no effect on the inhibition. however, the t region of the ti plasmid was required for inhibition.  studies of transposon mutants suggested that the tms but not tmr or ocs genes were required. these genes were not acting after transfer to plant cells since they were effective in strains lacking vir genes and thus unable to transfer dna  to plant cells. the results suggest that the expression of the tms genes in the bacteria may inhibit the development of the hypersensitive response by the plant. an examination of the genes required in p. savastanoi for the inhibition of the hypersensitive response suggested that bacterial production of auxin was also required for the inhibition of the hypersensitive response by these bacteria.

AB  == expression of the indoleacetic acid (iaa) operon, which contributes to the virulence of the phytopathogenic bacterium pseudomonas syringae subsp. savastanoi, was monitored by using broad-host-range lacz reporter gene plasmids.  a combination of translational (gene) fusions and transcriptional (operon) fusions of p. syringae subsp. savastanoi sequences to lacz allowed localization of the iaa operon promoter. rna recovered from p. syringae subsp. savastanoi strains was mapped with iaa operon-specific probes to precisely locate the transcription initiation site. when transcripts from an iaam::lacz fusion in escherichia coli were analyzed, an identical transcription initiation site was observed. the dna sequence of the iaa operon promoter closely resembled the consensus e. coli promoter sequence. we detected an active, constitutive level of indoleacetic acid biosynthetic gene expression during bacterial growth under a variety of conditions in the absence of host plant influence.

TI  == isolation and characterization of the gene from pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola encoding the phaseolotoxin-insensitive ornithine carbamoyltransferase.
AB  == the gene coding for the phaseolotoxin-insensitive ornithine carbamoyltransferase  (octase) from pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola has been cloned and sequenced. the gene has a deduced coding capacity for a polypeptide with a calculated mr of 36,520 daltons. comparison of the amino acid sequence of the octase enzymes encoded by the p. aeruginosa argf and the escherichia coli argi and argf genes with the deduced sequence of the newly identified gene shows that  79 amino acid residues are strictly conserved in all four polypeptides; among these 7 out of 9 residues are involved in enzyme function. of three amino acid regions that have been implicated in substrate binding or catalysis, two are strictly conserved, and the third involved in carbamoylphosphate binding differs. this correlates well with published data showing that phaseolotoxin competes for  the carbamoylphosphate binding site in the phaseolotoxin-sensitive octases. we propose that the gene be named argk.

TI  == three separate classes of bacterial ice nucleation structures.
AB  == studies of the properties of the ice nucleation structure exposed on the surfaces of various bacteria such as pseudomonas syringae, erwinia herbicola, or various strains of ice+ recombinant escherichia coli have shown that there are clearly three major related but chemically distinct types of structures on these cells. first, the ability of ice+ cells to nucleate super-cooled d2o has been examined,  and it has been found that this ability (relative to the ability of the same cells to nucleate super-cooled h2o) exhibited three characteristic nucleating patterns. the rarest structure, called class a, is found on only a small fraction of cells in a culture, nucleates h2o at temperatures above -4.4 degrees c, and is an effective nucleator of super-cooled d2o. a second class of structure, called class b, is found on a larger portion of the cells, nucleates h2o between -4.8 and -5.7 degrees c, and is a relatively poor nucleator of super-cooled d2o. the class c structure is found on almost all cells and nucleates at -7.6 degrees c or colder. these three classes of structures were also differentiated by their sensitivities to low concentrations of water-miscible organic solvents such as dioxane or dimethyl sulfoxide. depending on the specific bacterial strain, the addition of these solvents to bacterial suspensions lowered the nucleation activity of the class a structure by 1,000-fold or more. the nucleation activities of class b structures in the same culture were highly resistant to these compounds and were lowered only by 20 to 40%. the class c structures were more sensitive than class b structures were, and the nucleation activities decreased 70 to 90%. finally, the ph sensitivity of these three classes of structures was examined. the class a structure was destroyed in buffers at ph 4.5 lower but was stable in buffers at higher phs. the class b structure was less sensitive to acidic buffers but was destroyed at ph 5.5 or lower and was stable at higher phs. however, the class c structure was unaffected by incubation in buffers with phs of 3.5 to 9.0. suggestions for the actual nucleation structures  of the three classes are proposed.

TI  == a gene from pseudomonas syringae pv. glycinea with homology to avirulence gene d  from p. s. pv. tomato but devoid of the avirulence phenotype.
AB  == a gene was cloned from pseudomonas syringae pv. glycinea that hybridized to avirulence gene d (avrd), previously cloned from p. s. pv. tomato. unlike avrd, the hypersensitive response (hr) was not elicited when the p. s. pv. glycinea gene was reintroduced into p. s. pv. glycinea race 4 on a broad host range plasmid and the bacteria were inoculated into soybean leaves. dna sequence data disclosed that the p. s. pv. glycinea homologue of avrd encoded a protein containing 86% identical amino acids to avrd, with substitutions distributed throughout the protein. two orfs immediately downstream from the avrd homologue were more similar in p. s. pv. tomato and p. s. pv. glycinea, with 98 and 99% identical amino acids. expression of the wildtype p. s. pv. glycinea gene and recombinant genes constructed between the p. s. pv. tomato avrd gene and its p. s. pv. glycinea homologue in both escherichia coli and p. s. pv. glycinea indicated that the p. s. pv. glycinea gene product was formed less efficiently or was less stable than was the p. s. pv. tomato protein encoded by avrd. the data indicated that the p. s. pv. glycinea homologue represents a recessive allele of  the p. s. pv. tomato avrd gene which has been modified by mutation such that it does not lead to an avirulence phenotype on the normal host plant, soybean.

AB  == tagetitoxin, a chlorosis-inducing phytotoxin produced by pseudomonas syringae pv. tagetis, inhibits rna synthesis directed by chloroplast rna polymerase. in isolated chloroplasts, tagetitoxin quickly and specifically reduced the incorporation of [3h]uridine into rna. when it was added to transcriptionally active chloroplast protein extracts, the toxin directly inhibited incorporation of [32p]utp into rna. in addition, tagetitoxin inhibited in vitro rna synthesis directed by the rna polymerase from escherichia coli. in vitro transcription reactions directed by chloroplast rna polymerase or e. coli rna polymerase are inhibited at tagetitoxin concentrations less than 1 microm. nuclear rna polymerase ii purified from wheat germ was only affected at tagetitoxin concentrations greater than 100 microm during in vitro transcription. tagetitoxin concentrations as high as 1 mm did not affect in vitro transcription reactions directed by rna polymerase from bacteriophage t7 or sp6.

TI  == characterization of is476 and its role in bacterial spot disease of tomato and pepper.
AB  == is476 is an endogenous insertion sequence present in copper-tolerant strains of xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria. sequence analysis has revealed that the element is 1,225 base pairs in length, has 26-base-pair inverted repeats, and causes a 4-base-pair target site duplication upon insertion into the avirulence gene avrbs1. comparison of the full-length sequence with sequences in the national biomedical research foundation and national institutes of health data bases showed that one of the predicted is476 proteins is partially homologous to  the putative transposase of is3 from escherichia coli, and the inverted repeats of is476 have significant homology to the inverted repeats of the is51 insertion  sequence of pseudomonas syringae pv. savastanoi. a transposition assay based on the insertional inactivation of the sacrb locus of bacillus subtilis was used to  demonstrate that one of the three copies of is476 residing on the 200-kilobase copper plasmid pxvcu1 is capable of transposition in several strains of xanthomonas campestris. the position of is476 insertion in several avrbs1 mutants was established and was shown to influence both induction of hypersensitivity and bacterial growth in planta.

TI  == the predicted protein product of a pathogenicity locus from pseudomonas syringae  pv. phaseolicola is homologous to a highly conserved domain of several procaryotic regulatory proteins.
AB  == a ca. 20-kilobase (kb) region (hrp) that controls the interaction of pseudomonas  syringae pv. phaseolicola with its host (pathogenicity) and nonhost plants (hypersensitive reaction) was previously cloned and partially characterized. in this study we defined the limits and determined the nucleotide sequence of a hrp  locus (hrps), located near the right end of the hrp cluster. the largest open reading frame (orf302) in hrps has a coding capacity for a 302-amino-acid polypeptide. the predicted amino acid sequence of the translation product of orf302 (hrps) shows significant similarity to several procaryotic regulatory proteins, including the ntrc, nifa, and dctd proteins of rhizobium spp., the ntrc and nifa proteins of klebsiella pneumoniae, and the tyrr protein of escherichia coli. these proteins regulate diverse operons involved in nitrogen fixation, transport and metabolism of amino acids, and transport of c-4 dicarboxylic acids. the hrps protein appears to be the shortest naturally occurring member of this family of proteins, corresponding for the most part to the highly conserved central domain of these proteins, which contains a putative atp-binding site. a c-terminal segment analogous to the less-well-conserved domain, involved in dna binding of ntrc and nifa, is also present in hrps. these similarities suggest that hrps is a regulatory protein. in line with this prediction is the finding that a functional hrps gene is necessary for the activation of another hrp locus  during the plant-bacterium interaction.

TI  == localization of ice nucleation activity and the icec gene product in pseudomonas  syringae and escherichia coli.
AB  == ice nucleation activity and the icec gene product were quantified in different subcellular fractions of the pseudomonas syringae source strain and in escherichia coli containing the cloned icec gene to determine the activity of this protein in different subcellular locations. ice nuclei were nearly completely retained during isolation of cell envelopes but exhibited a decrease in the temperature at which they were expressed. ice nucleation activity was found in triton x-100 insoluble membrane fragments as well as in slowly sedimenting and high-density membrane fragments. nearly all ice nucleation activity was associated with the outer membrane because the partitioning of 3-ketodeoxyoctonate (a lipopolysaccharide component) and ice nuclei in cell fractions were similar to and opposite that of nadh oxidase (a cytoplasmic membrane component). the icec gene product had an apparent mass of 150,000 da based on migration in sds-polyacrylamide gels. this protein was not found in soluble cell components. nearly all of the icec gene product, which occurred in low abundance, was associated with the outer membrane of both p. syringae and e.  coli. therefore, the icec gene product is located at and is maximally active in or on the outer membrane of cells of the source strain and heterologous strains.

TI  == cotranscription of genes encoding indoleacetic acid production in pseudomonas syringae subsp. savastanoi.
AB  == indoleacetic acid (iaa) production by the plant pathogen pseudomonas syringae subsp. savastanoi is essential for tumor formation on olive and oleander. the bacterium produces iaa from tryptophan in reactions catalyzed by tryptophan monooxygenase and indoleacetamide hydrolase. the genetic determinants are, respectively, iaam and iaah. in oleander isolates, the genes encoding the iaa biosynthetic enzymes are located on a plasmid; in olive isolates, the genes occur on the chromosome. the iaa genes from the oleander isolate strain ew2009 are located within a 4-kilobase (kb) segment of the 52-kb plasmid piaa1. escherichia  coli strains harboring a recombinant plasmid, pcjp3, which contains this 4-kb fragment, excreted iaa into culture media, and crude cell extracts had both tryptophan monooxygenase and indoleacetamide hydrolase activity. in vitro coupled transcription-translation of pcjp3 demonstrated that this fragment coded for proteins of 62 and 47 kilodaltons which correspond to tryptophan monooxygenase and indoleacetamide hydrolase, respectively. expression of these genes was dependent upon a vector promoter in pcjp3. however, in the absence of a vector promoter, e. coli containing recombinant plasmids with additional piaa1 dna in front of iaam had high levels of tryptophan monooxygenase. northern (rna) hybridization experiments verified that iaam and iaah are cotranscribed as a portion of a ca. 4- to 5-kb transcript in vivo. southern hybridization experiments with iaa plasmids from different oleander strains of p. syringae subsp. savastanoi revealed that all iaa plasmids contained a region of at least 10 kb of homology, with the iaa genes at one end. repetitive dna and a copy of is51 were found at the end of this region of homology.

TI  == plasmid-mediated production of the phytotoxin coronatine in pseudomonas syringae  pv. tomato.
AB  == pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato pt23.2 produces the chlorosis-inducing phytotoxin coronatine. thirty-eight chlorosis-defective mutants of pt23.2 were previously generated by using the transposon tn5. five mutants contained tn5 insertions in the indigenous plasmid ppt23a; the remaining 33 mutants either were missing ppt23a (29 mutants) or contained deletions in this plasmid (4 mutants). these results suggested that ppt23a was involved in coronatine production in strain pt23.2. this plasmid was introduced into p. syringae pv. syringae ps61, which does not produce coronatine. a bioassay for coronatine suggested that ps61(ppt23a) transconjugants were able to make this phytotoxin. in a chemical analysis, organic acids were isolated from pt23.2, ps61, and the transconjugant ps61(ppt23a); these were derivatized to their methyl esters and analyzed by gas chromatography. the derivatized organic acids extracted from pt23.2 and ps61(ppt23a) contained peaks that corresponded to coronafacic acid, coronafacoylvaline, and coronatine, but these were absent in the extracts from the wild-type strain ps61. the identification of these components was confirmed by combined gas chromatography-mass spectrophotometry. therefore, the acquisition of ppt23a by ps61 resulted in biosynthesis of coronafacic acid, coronafacoylvaline, and coronatine, clearly demonstrating the involvement of ppt23a in coronatine production in p. syringae pv. tomato.

TI  == deletion mutagenesis of the ice nucleation gene from pseudomonas syringae s203.
AB  == the ice nucleation gene inaz, from pseudomonas syringae s203, was manipulated to  produce a series of defined rearrangements in its coding sequence without changing the reading frame. the effects of these mutations on the ice nucleation  phenotype were determined in a heterologous host, escherichia coli k12. deletions which disrupted the periodicity of 16 codons, in a repetitive region of inaz, caused the frequencies of ice nuclei in the bacterial population to be significantly depressed; the nuclei with thresholds at warmer temperatures were most affected. in contrast, when the periodicity was left intact, deletions and duplications in the same region had only slight effects on nucleation activity. deletions removing part or all of one of the nonrepetitive regions (that encoding the amino-terminal domain of the inaz protein) did not abolish nucleation activity, but caused it to be limited to cooler threshold temperatures. in contrast, the non-repetitive carboxy-terminal domain of the inaz protein was shown to be essential for ice nucleation at all temperatures. the differential requirements (for periodicity, and for the amino-terminus) in forming nuclei with different thresholds may be significant for understanding what determines the threshold temperature of an ice nucleus.

TI  == nonlinear relationship between concentration and activity of a bacterial ice nucleation protein.
AB  == the expression level of an ice nucleation gene (inaz) was varied in escherichia coli to observe the relationship between activity and gene product. the ice nucleation activity increased as the 2nd to 3rd power of the membrane concentration of the inaz gene product, implying that molecules of inaz protein interact cooperatively in groups of two to three at the rate-limiting step of ice nucleus assembly. the 2nd to 3rd power relationship was independent of the threshold temperature at which ice nucleation was measured and was consistent over a 500-fold range of protein concentration. such a relationship indicates that the same rate-limiting step must be common to the formation of ice nuclei displaying all the various threshold temperatures within a bacterial population.  observations of pseudomonas syringae, expressing the inaz gene at various levels, were consistent with a similar relationship and hence a similar mechanism of ice  nucleus assembly in pseudomonas.

AB  == the native 44-kilobase-pair plasmid ptar, discovered in a grapevine strain of agrobacterium tumefaciens, contains a single origin of dna replication confined to a 1.0-kilobase-pair region of the macromolecule. this region (ori) confers functions sufficient for replication in agrobacterium and rhizobium species but not in pseudomonas solanacearum, pseudomonas glumae, pseudomonas syringae pv. savastanoi, xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris, and escherichia coli. ori contains a repa gene that encodes a 28,000-dalton protein required for replication. nucleotide sequencing of repa and its promoter region revealed four  8-base-pair palindromic repeats upstream of the repa coding region. deletion of these repeats alters repa expression and plasmid copy number. downstream of repa  are three additional repeats in a region essential for replication. a locus responsible for plasmid partitioning (para) and a putative second locus regulating plasmid copy number are part of the origin region and are required for stable plasmid maintenance.

AB  == four bacterial species are known to catalyze ice formation at temperatures just below 0 degrees c. to better understand the relationship between the molecular structure of bacterial ice-nucleation site(s) and the quantitative and qualitative features of the ice-nucleation-active phenotype, we determined by gamma-radiation analysis the in situ size of ice-nucleation sites in strains of pseudomonas syringae and erwinia herbicola and in escherichia coli hb101 carrying the plasmid pice1.1 (containing a 4-kilobase dna insert from p. syringae that confers ice-nucleation activity). lyophilized cells of each bacterial strain were irradiated with a flux of gamma radiation from 0 to 10.2 mrad (1 mrad = 10(6) j/kg). differential concentrations of active ice nuclei decreased as a first-order function of radiation dose in all strains as temperature was decreased from -2 degrees c to -14 degrees c in 1 degrees c intervals. sizes of ice nuclei were calculated from the gamma-radiation flux at which 37% of initial  ice nuclei active within each 1 degrees c temperature interval remained. the minimum mass of a functional ice nucleus, active only between -12 degrees c and -13 degrees c, was about 150 kda for all strains. the size of ice nuclei increased logarithmically with increasing temperature from -12 degrees c to -2 degrees c, where the estimated nucleant mass was 19,000 kda. the ice nucleant in  these three bacterial species may represent an oligomeric structure, composed at  least in part of an ice gene product that can self-associate to assume many possible sizes.

AB  == a gene was previously cloned from pseudomonas syringae pv. glycinea race 6, designated avirulence gene a (avra), that controls the expression of virulence by the pathogen on specific cultivars of soybean. a 3.2-kilobase (kb) acci subclone  from the cosmid clone ppg6l3 was shown to be active when cloned into the broad-host-range vector prk404. transposon tn5 mutagenesis and deletion analysis  delineated a span of approximately 2.5 kb of dna that was necessary for gene activity. the nucleotide sequence of a 3.409-kb segment of dna which contained the avra gene has been determined. an open reading frame of 2.721 kb of dna, which correlates with the region of dna defined by transposon mutagenesis and deletion analysis, was identified. the open reading frame would encode a protein  of 100.866 kilodaltons, which is in good agreement with the 100-kilodalton protein expressed by escherichia coli maxicells.

TI  == copper resistance in bacteria.
AB  == copper is a required trace element for many organisms, yet it can exert an inhibitory effect on bacterial growth at relatively low concentrations. however,  there are some bacterial species that can tolerate high levels of copper. it also has been reported that copper resistance is plasmid-encoded in escherichia coli,  proteus vulgaris and a pseudomonas syringae isolate. it is not known if copper is effluxed from the cell, detoxified by binding to copper-binding proteins, or binds to cell-surface components. actual data on copper transport in bacteria is  also lacking, indicating that this area of research deserves serious attention.

TI  == secretion of zeatin, ribosylzeatin, and ribosyl-1'' -methylzeatin by pseudomonas  savastanoi: plasmid-coded cytokinin biosynthesis.
AB  == cytokinin production by strains of the phytopathogenic bacterium pseudomonas syringae pv savastanoi was measured by immunoaffinity chromatography of the culture medium on immobilized anti-cytokinin antibodies, followed by high performance liquid chromatography, radioimmunoassay and mass spectrometry. p. savastanoi strain pb213-2 secretes zeatin (80 nanograms per milliliter) and ribosylzeatin (80 nanograms per milliliter). even higher levels of zeatin (400 nanograms per milliliter) are produced by the olive-specific strain ew1006, which also produces 180 nanograms per milliliter of the recently identified cytokinin,  ribosyl-1'' -methylzeatin. the amounts secreted were approximately 1000 times greater than those secreted by agrobacterium tumefaciens (da regier, ro morris 1982 biochem biophys res commun 104: 1560-1566). examination of cytokinin production by plasmid deletion mutants of pb213-2 and ew1006 indicated that cytokinin biosynthesis was specified, at least in part, by plasmid-borne genes. a fragment of the 105 kilobase pair plasmid from ew1006 was cloned into escherichia coli where its expression resulted in dimethylallyl transferase activity and the  secretion of zeatin.

TI  == cloning and regulation of erwinia herbicola pigment genes.
AB  == the genes coding for yellow pigment production in erwinia herbicola eho10 (atcc 39368) were cloned and localized to a 12.4-kilobase (kb) chromosomal fragment. a  2.3-kb avai deletion in the cloned fragment resulted in the production of a pink-yellow pigment, a possible precursor of the yellow pigment. production of yellow pigment in both e. herbicola eho10 and pigmented escherichia coli clones was inhibited by glucose. when the pigment genes were transformed into a cya (adenylate cyclase) e. coli mutant, no expression was observed unless exogenous cyclic amp was provided, which suggests that cyclic amp is involved in the regulation of pigment gene expression. in e. coli minicells, the 12.4-kb fragment specified the synthesis of at least seven polypeptides. the 2.3-kb avai deletion  resulted in the loss of a 37k polypeptide and the appearance of a polypeptide of  40 kilodaltons (40k polypeptide). the synthesis of the 37k polypeptide, which appears to be required for yellow pigment production, was not repressed by the presence of glucose in the culture medium, as was the synthesis of other polypeptides specified by the 12.4-kb fragment, suggesting that there are at least two types of gene regulation involved in yellow pigment synthesis. dna hybridization studies indicated that different yellow pigment genes exist among different e. herbicola strains. none of six pigmented plant pathogenic bacteria examined, agrobacterium tumefaciens c58, cornyebacterium flaccumfaciens 1d2, erwinia rubrifaciens 6d364, pseudomonas syringae atcc 19310, xanthomonas campestris 25d11, and "xanthomonas oryzae" 17d54, exhibited homology with the cloned pigment genes.

TI  == identification and purification of a bacterial ice-nucleation protein.
AB  == the protein product of a gene (inaz) responsible for ice nucleation by pseudomonas syringae s203 has been identified and purified after overexpression in escherichia coli. the amino acid composition and the n-terminal sequence of the purified, denatured protein corresponded well with that predicted from the sequence of the inaz gene. the product of inaz was also found to be the major component in preparations of ice-nucleating, proteinaceous particles, obtained after extraction with and gel filtration in a mixture of urea and the nondenaturing detergent octyl beta-d-thioglucopyranoside. the activity of these preparations in the absence of added lipid implies that the protein participates  directly in the nucleation process.

TI  == cloning of the gene for indoleacetic acid-lysine synthetase from pseudomonas syringae subsp. savastanoi.
AB  == the phytopathogen pseudomonas syringae subsp. savastanoi incites the production of galls on olive and oleander plants. gall formation is dependent on bacterial production of the phytohormone indoleacetic acid (iaa). the genetic determinants  for iaa synthesis are located on a plasmid (piaa) and are organized in an operon  in oleander strains of the bacterium. p. syringae subsp. savastanoi further converts iaa to an amino acid conjugate, 3-indole-acetyl-epsilon-l-lysine (iaa-lysine). the gene for iaa-lysine synthetase (iaal) was found on the iaa plasmid by screening piaa deletion mutants for the ability to convert iaa to iaa-lysine. the iaal locus was then cloned in the vector puc8 from a bank of p. syringae subsp. savastanoi ew2009 plasmid dna to construct recombinant plasmid plg87. the specific activity of iaa-lysine synthetase in escherichia coli transformed with plg87 was 47 times higher than that of the enzyme extract from p. syringae subsp. savastanoi. the direction of transcription of the iaal gene was determined to be opposite to that of the iaa operon. the location of the iaal gene on piaa1 was mapped by tn5 insertion mutagenesis to a 2.5-kilobase-pair fragment 2 kilobase pairs from the iaa operon.

TI  == generation and characterization of tn5 insertion mutations in pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato.
AB  == tn5-induced insertion mutations were generated in the pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato genome by mating this plant pathogen with an escherichia coli strain carrying the suicide plasmid vector for tn5, pgs9. km transconjugants occurred at frequencies ranging from 2 x 10 to 9 x 10; approximately 5.5% of these transconjugants were also cm, indicating the presence of additional pgs9 dna sequences. approximately 1% of the km cm mutants were auxotrophic. southern blot  analysis revealed that the tn5 element had inserted into one unique site on the chromosome for each km cm transconjugant examined. physical and genetic tests of  tn5-induced auxotrophs showed that tn5 mutations in p. syringae pv. tomato were very stable and that secondary transposition of tn5 or its insertion sequence is50 was a rare event. nine of 920 km cm transconjugants screened on tomato seedlings either were avirulent or produced very mild symptoms. each of the virulence mutants was the result of a unique single-site tn5 insertion. five mutants also failed to induce a hypersensitivity reaction on tobacco.

TI  == indigenous plasmids in pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato: conjugative transfer and  role in copper resistance.
AB  == twenty strains of pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato were examined for the presence  of plasmid dna. p. syringae pv. tomato plasmids were grouped into five size classes: class a ranged from 95 to 103 kilobases (kb); class b ranged from 71 to  83 kb; class c ranged from 59 to 67 kb; class d ranged from 37 to 39 kb; and class e was 29 kb. all strains contained at least two plasmids in classes a and b. the conjugative ability of p. syringae pv. tomato plasmids in three strains was demonstrated by mobilization of the nonconjugative plasmid rsf1010 into pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae recipients. plasmids from the three conjugative strains were labeled with tn5. four conjugative plasmids were identified by their repeated transfer to p. syringae pv. syringae recipients. p. syringae pv. tomato  strains varied in sensitivity to copper sulfate (cuso4): mics were 0.4 to 0.6 mm  for sensitive strains, 1.2 mm for moderately resistant strains, and 1.6 to 2.0 mm for very resistant strains. one very resistant strain, pt23, functioned as a donor of copper resistance. recipient p. syringae pv. syringae strains ps51 and ps61 were inhibited by 0.1 mm cuso4, whereas the cuso4 mics for transconjugant strains ps51(ppt23a) and ps61(ppt23c) were 1.8 and 2.6 mm, respectively. p. syringae pv. tomato strains pt12.2 and pt17.2 were inhibited by 0.6 mm copper sulfate, but their copper sulfate mics were 2.6 and 1.8 mm, respectively, when they acquired ppt23c. therefore, copper resistance in pt23 was controlled by two  conjugative plasmids, designated ppt23a (101 kb) and ppt23c (67 kb).

TI  == cloning and expression of bacterial ice nucleation genes in escherichia coli.
AB  == epiphytic populations of pseudomonas syringae and erwinia herbicola are important sources of ice nuclei that incite frost damage in agricultural crop plants. we have cloned and characterized dna segments carrying the genes (ice) responsible for the ice-nucleating ability of these bacteria. the ice region spanned 3.5 to 4.0 kilobases and was continuous over this region in p. syringae cit7r1. the cloned fragments imparted ice-nucleating activity in escherichia coli. substantial increases in the nucleating activity of both e. coli and p. syringae  were obtained by subcloning the dna fragments on multicopy plasmid vectors. southern blot analysis showed substantial homology between the ice regions of p.  syringae and e. herbicola, although individual restriction sites within the ice regions differed between the two species.

TI  == regulation of 3-indoleacetic acid production in pseudomonas syringae pv. savastanoi. purification and properties of tryptophan 2-monooxygenase.
AB  == the oxidative decarboxylation of l-tryptophan to yield 3-indoleacetamide, catalyzed by tryptophan 2-monooxygenase, represents a controlling reaction in the synthesis of indoleacetic acid by pseudomonas savastanoi (pseudomonas syringae pv. savastanoi), a gall-forming pathogen of olive (olea europea l.) and oleander  (nerium oleander l.). production of indoleacetic acid is essential for virulence  of the bacterium in its hosts. tryptophan 2-monooxygenase was characterized to determine its role in indoleacetic acid metabolism in the bacterium. the enzyme was purified to apparent homogeneity from escherichia coli cells containing the genetic locus for this enzyme obtained from p. savastanoi. the preparation contained a single polypeptide with a mass of 62,000 that cross-reacted immunologically with a homologous protein in p. savastanoi. the holoenzyme contained one fad moiety/subunit with properties consistent with a catalytic function. the enzyme preparation catalyzed an l-tryptophan-dependent o2 uptake and yielded 3-indoleacetamide as a product. enzyme activity fit simple michaelis  menten kinetics with a km for l-tryptophan of 50 microm. 3-indoleacetamide and 3-indoleacetic acid were identified as regulatory effectors. the apparent ki for  3-indoleacetamide was 7 microm; that for indoleacetic acid was 225 microm. at km  concentrations of tryptophan, enzyme activity was inhibited 50% by 25 microm 3-indoleacetamide. in contrast, 230 microm indoleacetic acid was required to effect a similar inhibition. phenylalanine and tyrosine were ineffective as regulatory metabolites. these results indicate that iaa synthesis in p. savastanoi is regulated by limiting tryptophan and by feedback inhibition from indoleacetamide and indoleacetic acid.

TI  == comparison of physical and genetic properties of palindromic dna sequences.
AB  == some viable palindromic dna sequences were found to cause an increase in the recovery of genetic recombinants. although these palindromes contained no chi sites, their presence in cis caused apparent reca+-dependent recombination to increase severalfold. this biological property did not correlate with the physical properties of the palindromes' extrusion of cruciform structures in vitro. thus, two unrelated palindromes with similar effects on recombination in both escherichia coli and pseudomonas syringae displayed quite different kinetics of cruciform formation. in plasmids of native superhelical density, one palindrome underwent rapid cruciform formation at 55 degrees c, whereas the other did not form detectable cruciforms at any temperature. a shorter palindrome with  similarly rapid kinetics of cruciform formation did not affect recombination detectably. the lack of a clear relationship between physical and genetic properties was also demonstrated in the case of longer, inviable palindromes. here we found that the degree of asymmetry required in vivo to rescue a long palindrome from inviability far exceeded that required to kinetically prohibit cruciform extrusion in vitro.

AB  == isolation of bacteria from a field of bean plants (phaseolus vulgaris l.) with conspicuous symptoms of halo blight disease resulted in 123 bacterial strains from which 57 were identified as pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola . at 18 degrees c the phaseolotoxin production of the isolated strains differs widely in  submerse culture. only few strains produce high amounts of phaseolotoxin being comparable with those of the reference strain 1321, while most of the strains show a low capability of phaseolotoxin production. furthermore, we proved the stability of phaseolotoxin production of 29 strains. after one year about 50% of  the strains were extremely reduced in their capability of phaseolotoxin production. we found that the reason for this reduction of toxin production is the appearance of tox- segregants within a tox+ clone. at 24 degrees c all strains (with one exception) show considerable lower amounts of toxin production  or none at all: maximally 30% of the toxin amounts synthesized at 18 degrees c were produced. at 28 degrees c none of the isolated strains produce phaseolotoxin . the present data allow the conclusion to be drawn that in natural environments  there exists a wide spread regarding the amount and stability of the phaseolotoxin production.

AB  == pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola strain lr719 contains a 150 kilobase pair (kb) plasmid pmc7105, stably integrated into its chromosome. occasionally, single colony isolates of this strain contain an excision plasmid. eight unique excision plasmids were selected and characterized by bamhi restriction endonuclease and blot hybridization analyses. these plasmids ranged in size from 35 to 270 kb; the largest contained approximately 130 kb of chromosomal dna sequences. restriction  maps of pmc7105 were developed to deduce the site of integration and to identify  the fragments in which recombination occurred to produce each excision plasmid. the eight excision plasmids were arranged into five classes based on the sites where excision occurs. a 20 kb region of pmc7105, which includes bamhi fragment 9 and portions of adjacent fragments, is present in all excision plasmids and thought to contain the origin of replication. the site of integration on pmc7105  maps within bamhi fragment 8. this fragment shows homology with seven other bamhi fragments of pmc7105 and with five chromosomal fragments identified among the excision plasmids. the data strongly suggest that the integration of pmc7105 may  have occurred at a repetitive sequence present on the chromosome and on the plasmid.

TI  == a structural role for dihydropteroyl hexaglutamate in the tail baseplate of various bacteriophages.
AB  == a novel non-metabolic role is proposed for dihydropteroyl hexaglutamate as a critical link binding together sub-structures of the tail of escherichia coli bacteriophage t4. six molecules of this folate compound have been found to be components of the complex tail baseplate of the phage particle. the baseplate is  assembled using a total of at least 18 viral gene products in a series of reactions in which six wedge-like elements (each 0.7 x 10(6) daltons) bind symmetrically around a central tail plug (1.55 x 10(6) daltons) to form a flat hexagonal structure. it appears likely that the pteridine portion of the folate binds to a site on a viral-induced dihydrofolate reductase molecule, a wedge component, while the glutamate residues of the folate bind to a viral-induced thymidylate synthase molecule, a central plug component. additionally, it appears that the folyl glutamate residues play a role in forming a flexible bond between  the proximal end of the phage long tail fiber and the baseplate. two bacteriophages attacking a quite different bacterial host, pseudomonas syringae,  have been isolated and partially characterized. both phage strains have tail structures morphologically analogous to t4. both were irreversibly inactivated by an enzyme which cleaves the gamma-glutamyl bonds of folyl polyglutamate. it appears that these pseudomonas phage particles also contain a folyl poly-glutamate whose integrity is essential for their infectivity.
