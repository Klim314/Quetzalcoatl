TI  == a culture-independent sequence-based metagenomics approach to the investigation of an outbreak of shiga-toxigenic escherichia coli o104:h4.
AB  == importance: identification of the bacterium responsible for an outbreak can aid in disease management. however, traditional culture-based diagnosis can be difficult, particularly if no specific diagnostic test is available for an outbreak strain. objective: to explore the potential of metagenomics, which is the direct sequencing of dna extracted from microbiologically complex samples, as an open-ended clinical discovery platform capable of identifying and characterizing bacterial strains from an outbreak without laboratory culture. design, setting, and patients: in a retrospective investigation, 45 samples were  selected from fecal specimens obtained from patients with diarrhea during the 2011 outbreak of shiga-toxigenic escherichia coli (stec) o104:h4 in germany. samples were subjected to high-throughput sequencing (august-september 2012), followed by a 3-phase analysis (november 2012-february 2013). in phase 1, a de novo assembly approach was developed to obtain a draft genome of the outbreak strain. in phase 2, the depth of coverage of the outbreak strain genome was determined in each sample. in phase 3, sequences from each sample were compared with sequences from known bacteria to identify pathogens other than the outbreak  strain. main outcomes and measures: the recovery of genome sequence data for the  purposes of identification and characterization of the outbreak strain and other  pathogens from fecal samples. results: during phase 1, a draft genome of the stec outbreak strain was obtained. during phase 2, the outbreak strain genome was recovered from 10 samples at greater than 10-fold coverage and from 26 samples at greater than 1-fold coverage. sequences from the shiga-toxin genes were detected  in 27 of 40 stec-positive samples (67%). in phase 3, sequences from clostridium difficile, campylobacter jejuni, campylobacter concisus, and salmonella enterica  were recovered. conclusions and relevance: these results suggest the potential of metagenomics as a culture-independent approach for the identification of bacterial pathogens during an outbreak of diarrheal disease. challenges include improving diagnostic sensitivity, speeding up and simplifying workflows, and reducing costs.

TI  == high incidence of campylobacter concisus in gastroenteritis in north jutland, denmark: a population-based study.
AB  == the incidence of non-thermophilic campylobacter species was assessed in an unselected population-based study in a mixed urban and rural community in north jutland, denmark. in a 2-year study period, 11,314 faecal samples from 8302 patients with gastroenteritis were cultured with supplement of the filter method. we recovered a high incidence of campylobacter concisus (annual incidence 35/100,000 inhabitants), almost as high as the common campylobacter jejuni/coli.  in contrast, there was a very low incidence of other non-thermophilic campylobacter species, such as campylobacter upsaliensis. campylobacter concisus  was, unlike c. jejuni/coli, found more frequently among small children (<1 year)  and the elderly (>/= 65 years). around 10% of the patients with c. consisus had co-infections dominated by clostridium difficile and salmonella enterica, whereas co-infections occurred in about 5% of c. jejuni/coli patients. we observed a seasonal variation in c. jejuni/coli with a peak incidence in late summer months  and autumn, whereas there was an almost constant monthly prevalence of c. concisus. among patients participating in a questionnaire sub-study, there was a  higher degree of close contacts with animals, especially dogs, as well as a higher travel exposure among c. jejuni/coli patients compared with c. concisus patients. we did not culture any c. concisus in stool samples from a small cohort of healthy individuals. future studies have to focus on the clinical follow-up and the long-term risk of inflammatory bowel diseases in c. concisus-positive patients. we conclude that there is a high incidence of c. concisus in denmark.
