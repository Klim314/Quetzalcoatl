TI  == post-caesarean septicaemia in kandang kerbau hospital, singapore, 1993-1995.
AB  == we reviewed all documented cases of septicaemia following caesarean deliveries in kandang kerbau hospital between 1st january 1993 to 31st december 1995. there were 22 cases of septicaemia among 8201 caesarean births, and hence the incidence is 2.7:1000. there were 45,412 deliveries, and the overall caesarean section rate was 18.1%. among the 22 documented cases of septicaemia which came under this study, the most common clinical conditions found were endomyometritis (7 cases),  urinary tract infection (6 cases), and wound infection (3 cases). one of the three cases with wound infection also had pneumonia. there was one patient who had mild transient myocarditis. we could not determine with certainty any site of infection in five patients. the most common bloodstream bacterial isolates was staphylococcus aureus (16), while the uncommon ones were acinetobacter baumanii (2), escherichia coli (1), klebsiella sp. (1), staphylococcus epidermidis (1), streptococcus group f (1), peptostreptococcus species and veillonella species (1). there was no mortality and prompt, vigorous treatment had led to uneventful  recovery in all the cases.

TI  == bacteremia after upper gastrointestinal endoscopy.
AB  == during 24 months, 200 upper gastrointestinal endoscopies were performed on 193 patients. blood cultures were obtained before and five and 30 minutes after the procedure using thiol (50 ml) and trypticase soy broth (100 ml) media. the mean endoscopic time was 34 minutes. sixteen patients developed bacteremia (8%). twelve groups of microorganisms were detected in positive blood cultures: streptococcus (5 species), lactobacillus sp, veillonella alcalescens, staphylococcus aureus, staph epidermidis, propioni-bacterium acnes, corynebacterium acnes, and bacillus subtilis. seven patients had positive blood cultures at five and 30 minutes, eight at five minutes, and one at 30 minutes only. there was no clear correlation of bacteremia with the age or previous history of the patient, biopsy, active bleeding, endoscopic time, or findings. a  follow-up study of all patients for six months to two years indicated no complications related to endoscopy and/or bacteremia.
