TI  == amniotic fluid interleukin-1 beta and interleukin-6, but not interleukin-8 correlate with microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity in preterm labor.
AB  == problem: we compared the frequency of intra-amniotic infection in preterm labor (pl) with women not in labor, and correlated infection with amniotic fluid (af) cytokines. detailed identification of species, especially mycoplasmata, was tried to improve our understanding of the pathogenesis of pl. method of study: af from  20 women with pl and 20 controls were evaluated. infection was detected by pcr for mycoplasma hominis, ureaplasma urealyticum and 16s rrna bacterial gene, which was cloned and sequenced for bacterial identification. interleukin (il)-1beta, il-6, il-8 and tumor necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha levels were measured by elisa. results: frequency of intra-amniotic infection is higher in pl (40.0%). sequencing-based method identified bacteroides fragilis, prevotella bivia and leptotrichia amnionii, in addition to mycoplasma species detected by pcr. af infection correlated with increased il-1beta and il-6 levels. conclusion: the frequency of intra-amniotic infection, especially m. hominis, in pl women who delivered with 7 days, is high and correlates with high il-1beta and il-6 levels, but not il-8.

TI  == characterization of chorioamnionitis in 2nd-trimester c-section placentas and correlation with microorganism recovery from subamniotic tissues.
AB  == prolonged exposure to infection appears to influence fetal/neonatal development.  we characterize the relationship between histologic patterns of inflammation and  microorganism recovery from the placentas of live born infants delivered before the 28th postmenstrual week. the subamniotic parenchyma of 835 placentas delivered by cesarean section were cultured and evaluated for specific histologic patterns of inflammation in a blinded fashion. cases with prolonged membrane rupture were excluded. microorganisms were recovered from 41% of placentas. microorganisms found more frequently in placentas with high-grade chorionic plate inflammation include actinomyces, prevotella bivia, corynebacterium sp., escherichia coli, peptostreptococcus magnus, multiple species of streptococci, and mycoplasma sp., including ureaplasma urealyticum. these microorganisms were also associated with fetal vasculitis (neutrophilic infiltration of chorionic plate stem vessels or umbilical cord). recovery of microorganisms from placental  parenchyma is associated with histologic inflammation. the same microorganisms responsible for inciting high-grade chorionic plate inflammation are also most likely to promote fetal inflammation.

TI  == vaginal microflora in postmenopausal women who have not received estrogen replacement therapy.
AB  == we studied the vaginal microflora of 73 postmenopausal women who had never received estrogen replacement therapy. the median age of these women was 67 years, and none of them had bacterial vaginosis. lactobacilli were detected in 36 (49%) of these women at a mean concentration of 10(5.7) cfu/g of vaginal fluid. h2o2-producing lactobacilli were recovered from 38% of the women. some of the other organisms that were recovered, including gardnerella vaginalis (27% of the  women), ureaplasma urealyticum (13%), candida albicans (1%), and prevotella bivia (33%), were less frequently isolated from postmenopausal women than from women of reproductive age, while coliforms (41%) were recovered at higher frequencies. lactobacilli, yeasts, and bacterial vaginosis-associated bacteria are less commonly part of the vaginal microflora in postmenopausal women than in women of  reproductive age, which may explain the decrease in the incidence of bacterial vaginosis and yeast vaginitis among these women.

TI  == the normal vaginal flora, h2o2-producing lactobacilli, and bacterial vaginosis in pregnant women.
AB  == in this study of the vaginal flora of 171 pregnant women in labor at term, the flora was categorized as normal (lactobacillus predominant), intermediate, or representative of bacterial vaginosis (bv) on the basis of a vaginal smear. bv was diagnosed in 39 women (23%); the vaginal flora was classified as normal in 50% of cases and as intermediate in 27%. h2o2-producing lactobacilli were recovered from 5% of women with bv, 37% of those with an intermediate flora, and  61% of those with a normal flora. h2o2-negative lactobacilli were equally frequent (57%-65%) in all three groups. the microorganisms most frequently recovered from women with bv included gardnerella vaginalis, prevotella bivia/disiens, bacteroides ureolyticus, prevotella corporis/bacteroides levii, fusobacterium nucleatum, mobiluncus species, peptostreptococcus prevotii, peptostreptococcus tetradius, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, viridans streptococci, ureaplasma urealyticum, and mycoplasma hominis (p < .05 for each).  the presence of all but three of these organisms was inversely related to vaginal colonization by h2o2-producing lactobacilli; the exceptions were b. ureolyticus,  f. nucleatum, and p. prevotii. other microorganisms were equally frequent among women with and without bv. we conclude that specific groups of anaerobes are associated with bv in this population and that a strong association exists between species associated with bv and those inhibited by h2o2-producing lactobacilli.
