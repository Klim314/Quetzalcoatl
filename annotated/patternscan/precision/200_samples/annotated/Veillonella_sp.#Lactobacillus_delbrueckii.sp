TI == comparative in vitro activity of faropenem and 11 other antimicrobial agents against 405 aerobic and anaerobic pathogens isolated from skin and soft tissue infections from animal and human bites.
AB == faropenem, a new oral beta-lactam agent with a penem structure, was very active against 405 aerobic and anaerobic bite isolates. it inhibited 232 of 236 (98%) aerobic isolates, including all pasteurella spp. and eikenella corrodens at < or = 0.25 mg/l, and 164/169 (97%) anaerobic isolates, at < or = 1 mg/l. the 10 isolates that required > or = 2 mg/l for inhibition were one strain each of acinetobacter lwoffi, corynebacterium minutissimum, bacteroides ovatus, lactobacillus delbrueckii and peptostreptococcus tetradius, plus corynebacterium 'aquaticum' (two strains) and veillonella sp. (three strains).
