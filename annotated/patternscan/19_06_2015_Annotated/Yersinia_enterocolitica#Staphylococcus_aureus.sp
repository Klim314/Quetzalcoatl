TI  == antimicrobial impacts of essential oils on food borne-pathogens.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of twelve essential oil (pine oil, eucalyptus, thyme,  sage tea, lavender, orange, laurel, lemon, myrtle, lemon, rosemary and juniper) was tested by a disc diffusion method against food borne pathogens (escherichia coli, salmonella paratyphi a, klebsiella pneumoniae, yersinia enterocolitica, pseudomonas aeruginosa, aeromonas hydrophila, campylobacter jejuni, enterococcus  faecalis, staphylococcus aureus). the major components in essential oils were monoterpenes hydrocarbons, alpha-pinene, limonene; monoterpene phenol, carvacrol  and oxygenated monoterpenes, camphor, 1,8-cineole, eucalyptol, linalool and linalyl acetate. although the antimicrobial effect of essential oils varied depending on the chemical composition of the essential oils and specific microorganism tested, majority of the oils exhibited antibacterial activity against one or more strains. the essential oil with the lowest inhibition zones was juniper with the values varied from 1.5 to 6 mm. however, the components of essential oil of thyme and pine oil are highly active against food borne pathogen, generating the largest inhibition zones for both gram negative and positive bacteria (5.25-28.25 mm vs. 12.5-30 mm inhibition zones). these results  indicate the possibility use of the essential oils on food system as antimicrobial agents against food-borne pathogen. the article also offers some promising patents on applications of essential oils on food industry as antimicrobial agent.

TI  == supercritical co2 extraction of functional compounds from spirulina and their biological activity.
AB  == supercritical carbon dioxide (scco2) extraction and fractionation of spirulina platensis was carried out to obtain functional compounds with antioxidant, antimicrobial and enzyme inhibitory activities. extraction of scco2 was carried out using 200 g of spirulina powder at 40 masculinec under 120 bar pressure with  co2 flow rate of 1.2 kg h(-1). scco2 fraction obtained was further treated with hexane and ethyl acetate to identify its components. individual components were identified by comparing mass spectra of samples with standard data and retention  indices (ri) of c5-c20 n-alkanes mixture using the kovat index formula. the phenolic and flavonoid content of the scco2 extract was found to be 0.34 +/- 0.01 g/100 g and 0.12 +/- 0.01 g/100 g respectively. the scco2 extract had antioxidant activity with ic50 value of 109.6 +/- 3.0 mug ml(-1) for dpph (2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl hydrazyl radical), ic50 value of 81.66 +/- 2.5 mug ml(-1)  for reducing power and ic50 value of 112.70 +/- 0.8 mug ml(-1) for hydroxyl radical scavenging activity. further, antioxidant activity study on oxidative induced dna damage was analysed to elucidate the positive role of scco2 extract.  scco2 extracts showed high antimicrobial activity against gram-positive bacteria  (staphylococcus aureus fri 722 and bacillus cereus f 4810) compared to that of gram negative bacteria (escherichia coli mtcc 108 and yersinia enterocolitica mtcc 859). the scco2 extract exhibited inhibitory activity on both angiotensin-1  converting enzyme and alpha-glucosidase with ic50 values of 274 +/- 1.0 mug ml(-1) and 307 +/- 2.0 mug ml(-1) respectively.

TI  == synthesis and antibacterial properties of 2,3-dideoxyglucosides of terpene alcohols and phenols.
AB  == essential oils and their oxygenated terpene constituents possess potent antimicrobial properties. in the present study, a facile synthetic route to the 2,3-dideoxy 1-o-glucosides of important phenols and terpene alcohols in excellent yields (85-96%) has been delineated. studies on their antimicrobial action against four food-borne pathogens - bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli and yersinia enterocolitica - demonstrated that the zone of inhibition, in general, was higher for the 2,3-unsaturated 1-o-glucoside derivatives (1b-6b) and the corresponding saturated glucosides (1c-5c) when compared to the parent alcohols/phenols (1-6). the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) values for these derivatives too were generally lower than those of the parent compounds. furthermore, the time-kill and bacteriolysis assays too demonstrated the greater  antimicrobial potential of the derivatives. the 2,3-dideoxy 1-o-glucosides of phenols and terpene alcohols were more effective in their antimicrobial action than the corresponding parent compounds. the study indicated that these novel derivatives can find useful application in control of food-related pathogenic microbes in foods.

TI  == efficacy of ultraviolet (uv-c) light in a thin-film turbulent flow for the reduction of milkborne pathogens.
AB  == nonthermal technologies are being investigated as viable alternatives to, or supplemental utilization, with thermal pasteurization in the food-processing industry. in this study, the effect of ultraviolet (uv)-c light on the inactivation of seven milkborne pathogens (listeria monocytogenes, serratia marcescens, salmonella senftenberg, yersinia enterocolitica, aeromonas hydrophila, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus) was evaluated. the pathogens were suspended in ultra-high-temperature whole milk and treated at uv doses between 0 and 5000 j/l at a flow rate of 4300 l/h in a thin-film turbulent  flow-through pilot system. of the seven milkborne pathogens tested, l. monocytogenes was the most uv resistant, requiring 2000 j/l of uv-c exposure to reach a 5-log reduction. the most sensitive bacterium was s. aureus, requiring only 1450 j/l to reach a 5-log reduction. this study demonstrated that the survival curves were nonlinear. sigmoidal inactivation curves were observed for all tested bacterial strains. nonlinear modeling of the inactivation data was a better fit than the traditional log-linear approach. results obtained from this study indicate that uv illumination has the potential to be used as a nonthermal  method to reduce microorganism populations in milk.

TI  == microbiological diversity and prevalence of spoilage and pathogenic bacteria in commercial fermented alcoholic beverages (beer, fruit wine, refined rice wine, and yakju).
AB  == the present study examined 469 commercially available fermented alcoholic beverages (fabs), including beer (draft, microbrewed, and pasteurized), fruit wine (grape and others), refined rice wine, and yakju (raw and pasteurized). samples were screened for escherichia coli and eight foodborne pathogens (bacillus cereus, campylobacter jejuni, clostridium perfringens, escherichia coli o157:h7, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella spp., staphylococcus aureus, and yersinia enterocolitica), and the aerobic plate count, lactic acid bacteria, acetic acid bacteria, fungi, and total coliforms were also enumerated. microbrewed beer contained the highest number of microorganisms (average aerobic  plate count, 3.5; lactic acid bacteria, 2.1; acetic acid bacteria, 2.0; and fungi, 3.6 log cfu/ml), followed by draft beer and yakju (p < 0.05), whereas the  other fabs contained , 25 cfu/25 ml microorganisms. unexpectedly, neither microbial diversity nor microbial count correlated with the alcohol content (4.7  to 14.1%) or ph (3.4 to 4.2) of the product. despite the harsh conditions, coliforms (detected in 23.8% of microbrewed beer samples) and b. cereus (detected in all fabs) were present in some products. b. cereus was detected most frequently in microbrewed beer (54.8% of samples) and nonpasteurized yakju (50.0%), followed by pasteurized yakju (28.8%), refined rice wine (25.0%), other  fruit wines (12.3%), grape wine (8.6%), draft beer (5.6%), and pasteurized beer (2.2%) (p < 0.05). the finding that spore-forming b. cereus and coliform bacteria can survive the harsh conditions present in alcoholic beverages should be taken into account (alongside traditional quality indicators such as the presence of lactic acid-producing bacteria, acetic acid-producing bacteria, or both) when developing manufacturing systems and methods to prolong the shelf life of high-quality fab products. new strategic quality management plans for various fabs are needed.

TI  == expert elicitation as a means to attribute 28 enteric pathogens to foodborne, waterborne, animal contact, and person-to-person transmission routes in canada.
AB  == enteric illness contributes to a significant burden of illness in canada and globally. understanding its sources is a critical step in identifying and preventing health risks. expert elicitation is a powerful tool, used previously,  to obtain information about enteric illness source attribution where information  is difficult or expensive to obtain. thirty-one experts estimated transmission of 28 pathogens via major transmission routes (foodborne, waterborne, animal contact, person-to-person, and other) at the point of consumption. the elicitation consisted of a (snowball) recruitment phase; administration of a pre-survey to collect background information, an introductory webinar, an elicitation survey, a 1-day discussion, survey readministration, and a feedback exercise, and surveys were administered online. experts were prompted to quantify changes in contamination at the point of entry into the kitchen versus point of consumption. estimates were combined via triangular probability distributions, and medians and 90% credible-interval estimates were produced. transmission was attributed primarily to food for bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens, cyclospora cayetanensis, trichinella spp., all three vibrio spp. categories explored, and yersinia enterocolitica. multisource pathogens (e.g., transmitted commonly through both water and food) such as campylobacter spp., four escherichia coli categories, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella spp., and staphylococcus aureus were also estimated as mostly foodborne. water was the primary pathway for giardia spp. and cryptosporidium spp., and person-to-person transmission dominated for six enteric viruses and shigella spp. consideration of the point of attribution highlighted the importance of food handling and cross-contamination in the transmission pathway. this study provides source attribution estimates of enteric illness for canada, considering all possible transmission routes. further research is necessary to improve our understanding of poorly characterized pathogens such as sapovirus and e. coli subgroups in canada.

TI  == empirical prediction and validation of antibacterial inhibitory effects of various plant essential oils on common pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == in this study, fractional compound composition, antioxidant capacity, and phenolic substance content of 14 plant essential oils-anise (pimpinella anisum),  bay leaves (laurus nobilis), cinnamon bark (cinnamomum verum), clove (eugenia caryophyllata), fennel (foeniculum vulgare), hop (humulus lupulus), istanbul oregano (origanum vulgare subsp. hirtum), izmir oregano (origanum onites), mint (mentha piperita), myrtus (myrtus communis), orange peel (citrus sinensis), sage  (salvia officinalis), thyme (thymbra spicata), and turkish oregano (origanum minutiflorum)--were related to inhibition of 10 bacteria through multiple linear  or non-linear (m(n)lr) models-four gram-positive bacteria of listeria innocua, coagulase-negative staphylococci, staphylococcus aureus, and bacillus subtilis, and six gram-negative bacteria of yersinia enterocolitica, salmonella enteritidis, salmonella typhimurium, proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli o157:h7, and klebsiella oxytoca. a total of 65 compounds with different antioxidant capacity, phenolic substance content and antibacterial properties were detected with 14 plant essential oils. the best-fit m(n)lr models indicated that relative  to anise essential oil, the essential oils of oreganos, cinnamon, and thyme had consistently high inhibitory effects, while orange peel essential oil had consistently a low inhibitory effect. regression analysis indicated that beta-bisabolene (turkish and istanbul oreganos), and terpinolene (thyme) were found to be the most inhibitory compounds regardless of the bacteria type tested.

TI  == effects of climate change on the persistence and dispersal of foodborne bacterial pathogens in the outdoor environment: a review.
AB  == abstract according to the intergovernmental panel on climate change (ipcc), warming of the climate system is unequivocal. over the coming century, warming trends such as increased duration and frequency of heat waves and hot extremes are expected in some areas, as well as increased intensity of some storm systems. climate-induced trends will impact the persistence and dispersal of foodborne pathogens in myriad ways, especially for environmentally ubiquitous and/or zoonotic microorganisms. animal hosts of foodborne pathogens are also expected to be impacted by climate change through the introduction of increased physiological stress and, in some cases, altered geographic ranges and seasonality. this review article examines the effects of climatic factors, such as temperature, rainfall,  drought and wind, on the environmental dispersal and persistence of bacterial foodborne pathogens, namely, bacillus cereus, brucella, campylobacter, clostridium, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella, staphylococcus aureus, vibrio and yersinia enterocolitica. these relationships are then used to  predict how future climatic changes will impact the activity of these microorganisms in the outdoor environment and associated food safety issues. the  development of predictive models that quantify these complex relationships will also be discussed, as well as the potential impacts of climate change on transmission of foodborne disease from animal hosts.

TI  == a new series of antibacterial nitrosopyrimidines: synthesis and structure-activity relationship.
AB  == new nitrosopyrimidines were synthesized and evaluated as potential antibacterial  agents. different compounds structurally related with 4,6-bis(alkyl or arylamino)-5-nitrosopyrimidines were evaluated. some of these nitrosopyrimidines  displayed significant antibacterial activity against human pathogenic bacteria. among them compounds 1c, 2a-c, and 9a-c exhibited remarkable activity against methicillin-sensitive and -resistant staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, yersinia enterocolitica, and salmonella enteritidis. a detailed structure-activity relationship study, supported by theoretical calculations, aided us to identify and understand the minimal structural requirements for the antibacterial action of the nitrosopyrimidines reported here. thus, our results have led us to identify a topographical template that provides a guide for the design of new nitrosopyrimidines with antibacterial effects.

TI  == prevalence and characterization of foodborne pathogens from australian dairy farm environments.
AB  == the ability of foodborne pathogens to gain entry into food supply systems remains an ongoing concern. in dairy products, raw milk acts as a major vehicle for this  transfer; however, the sources of pathogenic bacteria that contaminate raw milk are often not clear, and environmental sources of contamination or the animals themselves may contribute to the transfer. this survey examined the occurrence of 9 foodborne pathogens in raw milk and environments of 7 dairy farms (3 bovine, 3  caprine, and 1 ovine farm) in summer and autumn, in victoria, australia. a total  of 120 samples were taken from sampling points common to dairy farms, including pasture, soil, feed, water sources, animal feces, raw milk, and milk filters. the prevalence of the bacillus cereus group, campylobacter, clostridium perfringens,  cronobacter, shiga-toxigenic escherichia coli, listeria, salmonella, coagulase-positive staphylococci (cps), and yersinia enterocolitica across the farms was investigated. the 2 most prevalent bacteria, which were detected on all farms, were the b. cereus group, isolated from 41% of samples, followed by cl. perfringens, which was isolated from 38% of samples. the highest occurrence of any pathogen was the b. cereus group in soil, present in 93% of samples tested. fecal samples showed the highest diversity of pathogens, containing 7 of the 9 pathogens tested. salmonella was isolated from 1 bovine farm, although it was found in multiple samples on both visits. out of the 14 occurrences where any pathogen was detected in milk filters, only 5 (36%) of the corresponding raw milk samples collected at the same time were positive for the same pathogen. all of the cps were staphylococcus aureus, and were found in raw milk or milk filter samples from 6 of the 7 farms, but not in other sample types. pathogenic listeria species were detected on 3 of the 7 farms, and included 4 l. ivanovii-positive samples, and 1 l. monocytogenes-positive water sample. shiga-toxigenic escherichia coli were identified in fecal samples from 3 of the 7 farms and in a  single raw milk sample. cronobacter species were identified on 4 of the 7 farms,  predominantly in feed samples. no y. enterocolitica was detected. results of this study demonstrate high standards of pathogen safety across the 7 farms, with a low incidence of pathogens detected in raw milk samples. monitoring feed contamination levels may help control the spread of bacterial species such as cl. perfringens and b. cereus through the farm environment, which is a natural reservoir for these organisms.

TI  == antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungal properties of wines and winery byproducts in relation to their flavonoid content.
AB  == grapes produce organic compounds that may be involved in the defense of the plants against invading phytopathogens. these metabolites include numerous phenolic compounds that are also active against human pathogens. grapes are used  to produce a variety of wines, grape juices, and raisins. grape pomace, seeds, and skins, the remains of the grapes that are a byproduct of winemaking, also contain numerous bioactive compounds that differ from those found in grapes and wines. this overview surveys and interprets our present knowledge of the activities of wines and winery byproducts and some of their bioactive components  against foodborne (bacillus cereus, campylobacter jejuni, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella enterica, staphylococcus aureus, yersinia enterocolitica, vibrio cholerae, vibrio vulnificus), medical (helicobacter pylori, klebsiella pneumoniae), and oral pathogenic bacteria, viruses (adeno, cytomegalo, hepatitis, noro, rota), fungi (candida albicans, botrytis cinerea), parasites (eimeria tenella, trichomonas vaginalis), and microbial toxins (ochratoxin a, shiga toxin) in culture, in vivo, and in/on food (beef, chicken, frankfurters, hot dogs, lettuce, oysters, peppers, pork, sausages, soup, spinach) in relation to composition and sensory properties. also covered are antimicrobial wine marinades, antioxidative and immunostimulating aspects, and adverse effects  associated with wine consumption. the collated information and suggested research needs might facilitate and guide further studies needed to optimize the use of wines and byproducts to help improve microbial food safety and prevent or treat animal and human infections.

TI  == toxin production and growth of pathogens subjected to temperature fluctuations simulating consumer handling of cold cuts.
AB  == it is crucial for the quality and safety of ready-to-eat (rte) foods to maintain  the cold chain from production to consumption. the effect of temperature abuse related to daily meals and elevated refrigerator temperatures on the growth and toxin production of bacillus cereus, bacillus weihenstephanensis and staphylococcus aureus and the growth of listeria monocytogenes and yersinia enterocolitica was studied. a case study with temperature loggings in the domestic environment during easter and christmas holidays was performed to select relevant time and temperature courses. a model for bacterial surface growth on food using nutrient agar plates exposed to variations in temperatures was used to simulate food stored at different temperatures and exposed to room temperature for short periods of time. the results were compared with predicted growth using  the modeling tool combase predictor. the consumers exposed their cold cuts to room temperatures as high as 26.5 degrees c with an average duration of meals was 47 min daily for breakfast/brunch during the vacations. short (</= 2 h) daily intervals at 25 degrees c nearly halved the time the different pathogens needed to reach levels corresponding to the levels associated with human infection or intoxication, compared with the controls continuously stored at refrigerator temperature. although the temperature fluctuations affected growth of both b. weihenstephanensis and s. aureus, toxin production was only detected at much higher cell concentrations than what has been associated with human intoxications. therefore, growth of l. monocytogenes and y. enterocolitica was found to be the limiting factor for safety. in combination with data on temperature abuse in the domestic environment, modeling programs such as combase  predictor can be efficient tools to predict growth of some pathogens but will not predict toxin production.

TI  == green conversion of agroindustrial wastes into chitin and chitosan by rhizopus arrhizus and cunninghamella elegans strains.
AB  == this article sets out a method for producing chitin and chitosan by cunninghamella elegans and rhizopus arrhizus strains using a green metabolic conversion of agroindustrial wastes (corn steep liquor and molasses). the physicochemical characteristics of the biopolymers and antimicrobial activity are described. chitin and chitosan were extracted by alkali-acid treatment, and characterized by infrared spectroscopy, viscosity and x-ray diffraction. the effectiveness of chitosan from c. elegans and r. arrhizus in inhibiting the growth of listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa,  salmonella enterica, escherichia coli and yersinia enterocolitica were evaluated  by determining the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) and the minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbc). the highest production of biomass (24.60 g/l), chitin (83.20 mg/g) and chitosan (49.31 mg/g) was obtained by r. arrhizus. chitin and chitosan from both fungi showed a similar degree of deacetylation, respectively of 25% and 82%, crystallinity indices of 33.80% and 32.80% for chitin, and 20.30% and 17.80% for chitosan. both chitin and chitosan presented similar viscosimetry of 3.79-3.40 cp and low molecular weight of 5.08x10(3) and 4.68x10(3) g/mol. they both showed identical mic and mbc for all bacteria assayed. these results suggest that: agricultural wastes can be produced in an environmentally friendly way; chitin and chitosan can be produced economically; and that chitosan has antimicrobial potential against pathogenic bacteria.

TI  == presence of enterotoxigenic staphylococcus aureus in artisan fruit salads in the  city of san luis, argentina.
AB  == an increase in the consumption of fruit juices and minimally processed fruits salads has been observed in recent years all over the world. in this work, the microbiological quality of artisan fruit salads was analysed. faecal coliforms, salmonella spp, shigella spp, yersinia enterocolitica and escherichia coli o157:h7 were not detected; nevertheless, eleven strains of staphylococcus aureus  were isolated. by multiplex pcr, all isolates showed positive results for s. aureus 16s rrna gene and 63.6% of them were positive for sea gene. furthermore, pcr sea positive strains were able to produce the corresponding enterotoxin. finally, the inactivation of these strains in fruit salads by nisin, lysozyme and edta, was studied. edta produced a total s. aureus growth inhibition after 60 h of incubation at a concentration of 250 mg/l. the presence of s. aureus might indicate inadequate hygiene conditions during salad elaboration; however, the enterotoxigenicity of the strains isolated in this study, highlights the risk of  consumers' intoxication. edta could be used to inhibit the growth of s. aureus in artisan fruit salads and extend the shelf life of these products.

TI  == evaluation and functional characterization of a biosurfactant produced by lactobacillus plantarum cfr 2194.
AB  == the study details the investigations on the ability of lactobacillus plantarum cfr 2194, an isolate from kanjika, a rice-based ayurvedic fermented product, to produce biosurfactant. surfactant production, as a function of fermentation time, indicates that the maximum production occurred at 72 h under stationary conditions. isolation, partial purification, and characterization of the biosurfactant produced have been carried out, and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ftir) spectra demonstrated that biosurfactants were constituted by  protein and polysaccharide fractions, i.e., possessed the structure typical of glycoprotein, which is affected by the medium composition and the phase of growth of the biosurfactant-synthesizing strain. critical micelle concentration (cmc) of the biosurfactant was found to be 6 g l(-1). the emulsification index (ei), emulsification activity (ea), and emulsion stability (es) values of the biosurfactant have confirmed its emulsification property. aqueous fractions of the produced biosurfactant exhibited a significant antimicrobial activity against the food-borne pathogenic species: escherichia coli atcc 31705, e. coli mtcc 108, salmonella typhi, yersinia enterocolitica mtcc 859, and staphylococcus aureus f 722. more importantly, the biosurfactant from l. plantarum showed antiadhesive property against above food-borne pathogens. the results thus indicate the potential for developing strategies to prevent microbial colonization of food contact surfaces and health-care prosthesis using these biosurfactants.

TI  == probiotic characterization of potential hydrolases producing lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis isolated from pickled yam.
AB  == the aim of this study was to characterize potential probiotic strain co-producing alpha-amylase and beta-galactosidase. sixty-three strains, isolated from pickle samples were screened for their hydrolase producing capacity by utilizing different starches as carbon source. one out of 63 strains, isolated from traditionally fermented pickled yam showing maximum hydrolase activity (alpha-amylase (36.9 u/ml) and beta-galactosidase (42.6 u/ml)) within a period of 48 hours was identified as lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis. further, it was assessed for the probiotic characteristics under gastrointestinal conditions like acidic, alkaline, proteolytic enzymes, bile stress and found to exhibit tolerance to these stresses. the therapeutic potential of the isolate is implicated because of its antagonistic effect against enteric foodborne pathogens (salmonella typhimurium, escherichia coli 0157:h7, staphylococcus aureus, yersinia enterocolitica and aeromonas hydrophila). the results of this study entail a potential applicability of the isolate in developing future probiotic foods besides the production of industrially significant hydrolases.

AB  == the intussusception (iia) is an invagination of the immediate part of the intestine. she is responsible for a syndrome with an occlusive venous compression and swelling that can rapidly progress to intestinal necrosis. most cases occur in children aged 6 to 18 months and occur more frequently in boys than girls. there are two types of iia: the iia idiopathic representing 90-95% of invaginations of the child and the iia secondary to local injury of the gastrointestinal tract or occurring in a particular context whose frequency are between 5 and 10%. the pathogenesis of the iia remains uncertain, but the infectious origin is criminalized in most idiopathic invaginations. this component is dominated by viral agents including adenovirus, rotavirus, enterovirus, human herpesvirus 6 and 7, cytomegalovirus and epstein-barrvirus. bacterial agents are rather found and include yersinia enterocolitica, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli o157, h7, salmonella and campylobacter. in a small proportion parasitic agents may be reported in the iia, the most frequently found are entamoeba histolytica, trichuris trichuira, ascaris lumbricoides, ankylostoma and giardia.

AB  == the objective of this study was to evaluate the changes in microbial contamination levels of each porcine carcass and fresh pork in a general distribution process. a total of 100 commercial pigs were sampled (six sampling sites per individual, total 600 samples) at four sequential stages: slaughterhouse (after carcass grading and boning), processing line, retail outlet, and local market. no significant differences were observed in the contaminant percentages among sampling sites and sample collection years (p>0.05) with the exception of bacillus cereus. the contaminant percentage of b. cereus at 1st collection year was higher than these of 2nd collection year (28.31% vs. 12.26%, p<0.05). b. cereus and listeria monocytogenes were the most frequently detected pathogenic bacteria in the slaughterhouse and markets, respectively. on  the other hand, escherichia coli o157:h7 and yersinia enterocolitica were not detected in carcasses or pork collected from any carcass sites and pork samples.  however, the frequency of pathogenic bacteria in end-products at local markets was not highly related to the initial contamination of porcine carcasses in the slaughterhouse. thus, the improvement of microbial safety for pork end-products requires hygienic control of porcine carcasses and meat cutting during all operations in the slaughterhouse, processing line, retail outlet, and local market.

TI  == synthesis of quinoline derivatives of tetrahydrocurcumin and zingerone and evaluation of their antioxidant and antibacterial attributes.
AB  == tetrahydrocurcumin (thc, 1) and zingerone (2) are biologically active molecules originating from the important spices turmeric and ginger, respectively. novel quinoline derivatives of thc and zingerone have been synthesised by an efficient  protocol involving their reaction with substituted 2-aminobenzophenones and 2-aminoacetophenone. radical-scavenging activities (rsa) of thc, zingerone and their quinoline derivatives were evaluated. the amino-substituted quinoline derivative of thc, 1e, showed antioxidant activity superior to those of 1 and 1a. derivatives 1b, 1c, 1d and 1f exhibited relatively lower rsa at equimolar concentrations ( approximately 50-55 mumol). a similar trend was also seen in zingerone (2) and its derivatives (2a-2e), with 2e displaying the best rsa. derivatives of thc (1a-1f) showed stronger antimicrobial activity than thc (1) against staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, escherichia coli, and yersinia enterocolitica. also, derivatives of zingerone (2b-2e) exhibited lower minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) values than zingerone (2) and its derivative, 2a  for both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. the molecules may have potential pharmacological applications.

TI  == differential modulation of intracellular survival of cytosolic and vacuolar pathogens by curcumin.
AB  == curcumin, a principal component of turmeric, acts as an immunomodulator regulating the host defenses in response to a diseased condition. the role of curcumin in controlling certain infectious diseases is highly controversial. it is known to alleviate symptoms of helicobacter pylori infection and exacerbate that of leishmania infection. we have evaluated the role of curcumin in modulating the fate of various intracellular bacterial pathogens. we show that pretreatment of macrophages with curcumin attenuates the infections caused by shigella flexneri (clinical isolates) and listeria monocytogenes and aggravates those caused by salmonella enterica serovar typhi ct18 (a clinical isolate), salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, staphylococcus aureus, and yersinia enterocolitica. thus, the antimicrobial nature of curcumin is not a general phenomenon. it modulated the intracellular survival of cytosolic (s. flexneri and l. monocytogenes) and vacuolar (salmonella spp., y. enterocolitica, and s. aureus) bacteria in distinct ways. through colocalization experiments, we demonstrated that curcumin prevented the active phagosomal escape of cytosolic pathogens and enhanced the active inhibition of lysosomal fusion by vacuolar pathogens. a chloroquine resistance assay confirmed that curcumin retarded the escape of the cytosolic pathogens, thus reducing their inter- and intracellular spread. we have demonstrated that the membrane-stabilizing activity of curcumin is crucial for its differential effect on the virulence of the bacteria.

TI  == label-free detection of a bacterial pathogen using an immobilized siderophore, deferoxamine.
AB  == pathogenic bacteria obtain the iron necessary for survival by releasing an iron chelator, termed a siderophore, and retrieving the iron-siderophore complex via a cell surface siderophore receptor. we have exploited the high affinity of yersinia enterocolitica for its siderophore, deferoxamine, to develop a rapid method for capture and identification of yersinia. in this methodology, a deferoxamine-bovine serum albumin conjugate is printed onto a gold-plated chip in a parallel line pattern. after flowing a suspension of yersinia across the siderophore-derivatized chip, any yersinia that binds to the chip is detected by  dark-field microscopy analysis of the scattered light, followed by fourier transform analysis of the scattering pattern. since peak intensities are found to correlate with pathogen concentration, pathogen titers as low as 10(3) cfu/ml can be readily detected. moreover, immobilized deferoxamine can distinguish y. enterocolitica, which binds ferrioxamine (deferoxamine-fe), from staphylococcus aureus, mycobacterium smegmatis and pseudomonas aeruginosa, which don't. because  human pathogens cannot easily mutate their iron retrieval systems without loss of viability, we suggest that few if any mutant yersinia will emerge that can avoid  detection. together with previous results demonstrating selective capture of pseudomonas aeruginosa by its immobilized siderophore (pyoverdin), these data suggest that pathogen-specific siderophores may constitute effective and immutable capture ligands for rapid detection and identification of their cognate pathogens.

TI  == [the new microbiological hazards in food].
AB  == this paper describes the new microbiological hazards in food. for protecting human health, nowadays food safety authorities face with many challenges, that years ago were largely unheard. in 2011 verocytotoxigenic escherichia coli o104:h4 has been isolated in germany. strain came from fenugreek sprouts originated from egypt. it was characterized by unique features such as presence of enteroaggregative escherichia coli genes (aata, aggr, aap, agga, aggc) and resistance to most antibiotics. in poland only three cases of disease caused by o104:h4 strain have been reported. another emergence pathogen in poland is yersinia enterocolitica 08, biotype 1b. it is the most pathogenic bioserotype recently isolated in the usa only. food-borne is commonly associated with raw or  undercooked pork. the source of yersinia spp. may be also milk and water. the presence ofbotulinum neurotoxins in food is not new, but still an important issue because of their high toxicity to human. botulinum neurotoxins are high-molecular thermolabile proteins produced by clostridium botulinum and some strains of clostridium butyricum and clostridium baratii. based on their antigenic properties, botulin neurotoxins are divided into seven types a-g, however only types a, b, e and f are toxic to humans and some animals. increasing risk associated with food results from antimicrobial resistance eg. extended spectrum  beta-lactamases (esbls) producing bacteria, particularly enterobacteriaceae. until recently strains esbl+ were isolated in hospitals, however during last years they have been isolated from healthy humans, animals and food of animal origin. increasingly common microbiological hazard in food is methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa). although prevalence of this pathogen in food is not high, the thread comes from difficulties of treating of infections caused by mrsa. the occurrence of food-borne in humans may also be associated with presence of viruses in food and water. the carrier of viruses may be equipment in food plant, production line, packaging and man. most food-borne are caused by noroviruses, rotaviruses, hepatitis a virus and hepatitis e virus.  an increased number of food-borne viral outbreaks are recorded in several countries. reasons for this include the improved diagnostic methods that have enhanced detection of some virus groups, and the increased marketing of fresh and frozen foods that has led to a worldwide availability of high risk food. viruses  may contaminate food either through contamination at source, principally through  sewage pollution of the environment, or in association with food

TI  == pasteurization of milk: the heat inactivation kinetics of milk-borne dairy pathogens under commercial-type conditions of turbulent flow.
AB  == this is the first study to report kinetic data on the survival of a range of significant milk-borne pathogens under commercial-type pasteurization conditions. the most heat-resistant strain of each of the milk-borne pathogens staphylococcus aureus, yersinia enterocolitica, pathogenic escherichia coli, cronobacter sakazakii (formerly known as enterobacter sakazakii), listeria monocytogenes, and salmonella was selected to obtain the worst-case scenario in heat inactivation trials using a pilot-plant-scale pasteurizer. initially, approximately 30 of each species were screened using a submerged coil unit. then, uht milk was inoculated  with the most heat-resistant pathogens at ~10(7)/ml and heat treated in a pilot-plant-scale pasteurizer under commercial-type conditions of turbulent flow  for 15s over a temperature range from 56 to 66 degrees c and at 72 degrees c. survivors were enumerated on nonselective media chosen for the highest efficiency of plating of heat-damaged bacteria of each of the chosen strains. the mean log(10) reductions and temperatures of inactivation of the 6 pathogens during a 15-s treatment were staph. aureus >6.7 at 66.5 degrees c, y. enterocolitica >6.8  at 62.5 degrees c, pathogenic e. coli >6.8 at 65 degrees c, c. sakazakii >6.7 at  67.5 degrees c, l. monocytogenes >6.9 at 65.5 degrees c, and salmonella ser. typhimurium >6.9 at 61.5 degrees c. the kinetic data from these experiments will  be used by the new zealand ministry of agriculture and forestry to populate the quantitative risk assessment model being developed to investigate the risks to new zealand consumers from pasteurized, compared with nonpasteurized, milk and milk products.

TI  == acanthamoeba polyphaga, a potential environmental vector for the transmission of  food-borne and opportunistic pathogens.
AB  == the endosymbiotic relationship could represent for many bacteria an important condition favouring their spread in the environment and in foods. for this purpose we studied the behaviour of some food-borne and opportunistic pathogens (listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis, aeromonas hydrophila, yersinia enterocolitica) when internalized in acanthamoeba polyphaga. our results confirm the capability of the bacteria tested to grow within amoebal hosts. we can observe two types of interactions of the bacteria internalized in a. polyphaga. the first type, showed by y. enterocolitica and a. hydrophila, was characterized by an early replication, probably followed by the killing and digestion of the bacteria. the  second type, showed by e. faecalis and s. aureus was characterized by the persistence and grow inside the host without lysis. lastly, when amoebae were co-cultured with l. monocytogenes and s. enteritidis, an eclipse phase followed by an active intracellular growth was observed, suggesting a third type of predator-prey trend. the extracellular count in presence of a. polyphaga, as a result of an intracellular multiplication and subsequent release, was characterized by an increase of e. faecalis, s. aureus, l. monocytogenes and s. enteritidis, and by a low or absent cell count for y. enterocolitica and a. hydrophila. our study suggests that the investigated food-borne and opportunistic pathogens are, in most cases, able to interact with a. polyphaga, to intracellularly replicate and, lastly, to be potentially spread in the environment, underlining the possible role of this protozoan in food contamination.

TI  == hygienic quality and antibiotic resistance profile of sliced butchery.
AB  == in order to investigate the microbiological quality of different meat products on the greek market, 200 samples were collected from the following preparations: boiled turkey (n=50), boiled pork ham (n=50), smoked turkey (n=50) and smoked pork ham (n=50). in all cold meat preparations clostridium perfringens vegetative and spore forms, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli and other clostridium sp lec(-), as well as lactobacillus, bacillus sp. and salmonella sp. were recovered. for instance bacillus cereus was present in 6% of the samples. l. monocytogenes,  campylobacter jejuni and campylobacter coli were rarely present (1-4%) while yersinia enterocolitica and campylobacter lari were absent. differences in the occurrence of s. aureus, salmonella sp., e. coli and spore forms of c. perfringens in boiled and smoked samples, reflects either the differences in the  processing of the foods or could be associated to the extensive handling by the personnel during the purchasing (storage, slicing, wrapping). antibiotic resistance on specific antibiotics for each pathogen was also studied. a multiresistance antibiotic profile was effective for most bacterial strains, and  pronounced resistance profiles were observed for the commonly used antibiotics as ampicillin, penicillin, cephalothin, streptomycin followed by ceftriaxone and gentamycin. albeit this high observed resistance profile, the tested strains generally conserved their susceptibility to amikacin, aztreonam, chloramphenicol  and tylosin conserved an almost absent resistance. antibiotics commonly used for  therapeutic purposes, as well as antibiotics added to feed stuff of animals for increasing animal flesh production should contribute to the extensive spreading of antibiotic resistance in food and the environment. systematically monitoring of the microbiological quality of cold butchery preparations must be done, in order to preserve food quality, optimizing the processing and elaboration methods of the product and safeguard the public health.

TI  == development of a dna microarray for detection and identification of legionella pneumophila and ten other pathogens in drinking water.
AB  == the safety and accessibility of drinking water are major concerns throughout the  world. consumption of water contaminated with infectious agents, toxic chemicals  or radiological hazards represents a significant health risk and is strongly associated with mortality. therefore, we have developed an oligonucleotide-based  microarray using the sequences of 16s-23s rdna internal transcribed spacer regions (its) and the gyrase subunit b gene (gyrb) found in the most prevalent and devastating waterborne pathogenic agents. this new diagnostic contains 26 specific probes and can simultaneously detect aeromonas hydrophila, klebsiella pneumoniae, legionella pneumophila, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella spp., shigella spp., staphylococcus aureus, vibrio choleraeo, vibrio parahaemolyticus,  yersinia enterocolitica and leptospira interrogans. testing was carried out against a total of 218 bacterial strains, including 53 representative strains, 103 clinical isolates and 62 strains of other bacterial species belonging to 10 genera and 48 species. the results were specific and reproducible, with a detection sensitivity of 0.1 ng dna or 10(4)cfu/ml achieved for pure cultures of  each target organism. the diluted cultures and real drinking water samples were tested by the microarray with 100% accuracy. this novel diagnostic method is superior in time- and labor-efficiency to conventional bacterial culture and antiserum agglutination, and can be readily applied to epidemiological surveillance and other food safety applications.

TI  == bacterial toxins induce sustained mrna expression of the silencing transcription  factor klf2 via inactivation of rhoa and rhophilin 1.
AB  == yersiniae bearing the yersinia virulence plasmid pyv impact the transcriptome of  j774a.1 macrophage-like cells in two distinct ways: (i) by suppressing, in a yersinia outer protein p (yopp)-dependent manner, the induction of inflammatory response genes and (ii) by mrna induction of the silencing transcription factor klf2. here we show that klf2 induction by yersinia enterocolitica occurs in several cell lines of macrophage and squamous and upper gastrointestinal epithelial origin as well as in bone marrow-derived dendritic cells. several strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus are equally effective as y. enterocolitica in inducing klf2 expression. screening of mutant strains or  incubation with recombinant toxins identified the rho-inactivating toxins yopt from yersinia spp., exos from pseudomonas aeruginosa, edin-b from staphylococcus  aureus, and c3bot from clostridium botulinum as bacterial inducers of klf2 mrna.  klf2 mrna induction by these toxins does not require de novo protein synthesis. serum response factor or actin depolymerization does not seem to be involved in regulating klf2 expression in response to bacterial infection. instead, short hairpin rna-mediated inactivation of rhoa and its effector rhophilin 1 is sufficient to induce long-term klf2 expression. thus, bacteria exploit the rhoa-rhophilin signaling cascade to mediate sustained expression of the immunosuppressive transcription factor klf2.

TI  == evidence-based semiquantitative methodology for prioritization of foodborne zoonoses.
AB  == objectives: to prioritize an extended list of food- and water-borne zoonoses to allow food safety authorities to focus on the most relevant hazards in the food chain. methods: an evidence-based semiquantitative methodology was developed. scores were given by 35 scientific experts in the field of animal and public health, food, and clinical microbiology and epidemiology to 51 zoonotic agents according to five criteria related to public health (severity and occurrence in humans), animal health (severity of disease coupled with economic consequences and occurrence in animals), and food (occurrence in food). the scoring procedure  was standardized and evidence-based as experts were provided, for each zoonotic agent, a same set of up-to-date help information data related to the five criteria. independently, the relative importance of the five criteria was weighted by seven food chain risk managers. the zoonotic agents were ranked based on overall weighted scores and were grouped in four statistically different levels of importance. results: the following foodborne zoonotic pathogens were classified as "most important": salmonella spp., campylobacter spp., listeria monocytogenes, and verocytotoxigenic escherichia coli. a second group of "significant importance" included toxoplasma gondii, the agent of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, clostridium botulinum, staphylococcus aureus, cryptosporidium parvum, mycobacterium bovis, echinococcus granulosus, streptococcus spp., echinococcus multilocularis, yersinia enterocolitica, mycobacterium avium, fasciola hepatica, giardia intestinalis, and rotavirus. conclusions: this methodology allowed to rank 51 zoonotic agents with objectivity and taking account of a combined input from risk assessors and risk managers. applications: these results support food safety policy makers to establish the multiannual monitoring program of foodborne zoonoses. they also enable to identify knowledge gaps on specific zoonotic agents and to formulate key research questions. principally, this method of prioritization is of general interest as it can be applied for any other ranking exercise and in any country.

TI  == effect of mixed antimicrobial agents and flavors in active packaging films.
AB  == active packaging is an emerging food technology to improve the quality and safety of food products. many works have been developed to study the antimicrobial activity of essential oils. essential oils have been traditionally used as flavorings in food, so they have an important odor impact but they have as well antimicrobial properties that could be used to protect the food. recent developments in antimicrobial active packaging showed the efficiency of essential oils versus bread and bakery products among other applications. however, one of the main problems to face is the odor and taste they could provide to the packaged food. using some aromas to mask the odor could be a good approach. that  is why the main objective of this paper is to develop an antimicrobial packaging  material based on the combination of the most active compounds of essential oils  (hydrocinnamaldehyde, oregano essential oil, cinnamaldehyde, thymol, and carvacrol) together with some aromas commonly used in the food industry. a study  of the concentration required to get the antimicrobial properties, the organoleptic compatibility with typical aroma present in many food systems (vanilla, banana, and strawberry), and the right combination of both systems has  been carried out. antimicrobial tests of both the mentioned aromas, the main components of some essential oils, and the combination of both groups were carried out against bacteria (enterococcus faecalis, listeria monocytogenes, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella choleraesuis, yersinia enterocolitica, escherichia coli), yeasts (candida albicans, debaryomyces hansenii, zygosaccharomyces rouxii), and molds (botrytis cinerae, aspergillus flavus, penicillium roqueforti, eurotium repens, penicillium islandicum, penicillium commune, penicillium nalgiovensis). the sensory properties of the combinations were evaluated with a triangular test and classification was by an order test; the odor threshold of the aroma compounds was also studied. the results reveal that none of the aromas had antimicrobial properties. the most antimicrobial compounds are thymol, carvacrol, and cinnamaldehyde, but none of them could be combined with banana aroma, whereas only thymol with strawberry aroma gave the right combined organoleptic profile. all of the antimicrobials under study could be combined with vanilla aroma, providing both antimicrobial property and the odor expected.

AB  == sideromycins are antibiotics covalently linked to siderophores. they are actively transported into gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. energy-coupled transport across the outer membrane and the cytoplasmic membrane strongly increases their antibiotic efficiency; their minimal inhibitory concentration is  at least 100-fold lower than that of antibiotics that enter cells by diffusion. this is particularly relevant for gram-negative bacteria because the outer membrane, which usually forms a permeability barrier, in this case actively contributes to the uptake of sideromycins. sideromycin-resistant mutants can be used to identify siderophore transport systems since the mutations are usually in transport genes. two sideromycins, albomycin and salmycin, are discussed here. albomycin, a derivative of ferrichrome with a bound thioribosyl-pyrimidine moiety, inhibts seryl-t-rna synthetase. salmycin, a ferrioxamine derivative with  a bound aminodisaccharide, presumably inhibts protein synthesis. crystal structures of albomycin bound to the outer membrane transporter fhua and the periplasmic binding protein fhud have been determined. albomycin and salmycin have been used to characterize the transport systems of escherichia coli and streptococcus pneumoniae and of staphylococcus aureus, respectively. the in vivo  efficacy of albomycin and salmycin has been examined in a mouse model using yersinia enterocolitica, s. pneumoniae, and s. aureus infections. albomycin is effective in clearing infections, whereas salmycin is too unstable to lead to a large reduction in bacterial numbers. the recovery rate of albomycin-resistant mutants is lower than that of the wild-type, which suggests a reduced fitness of  the mutants. albomycin could be a useful antibiotic provided sufficient quantities can be isolated from streptomycetes or synthesized chemically.

TI  == bacterial particle endocytosis by epithelial cells is selective and enhanced by tumor necrosis factor receptor ligands.
AB  == bacterial pathogens use virulence strategies to invade epithelial barriers, but active processes of epithelial cells may also contribute to the endocytosis of microbial particles. to focus on the latter, we studied the uptake of fixed and fluorescently labeled bacterial particles in intestinal and bronchoepithelial cell cultures and found it to be enhanced in caco-2bbe and nci-h292 cells after treatment with tumor necrosis factor alpha and an agonist antibody against the lymphotoxin beta receptor. confocal fluorescence microscopy, flow cytometry, and  transmission electron microscopy revealed that staphylococcus aureus and yersinia enterocolitica were readily endocytosed, although there was scant uptake of shigella sonnei, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, and klebsiella pneumoniae particles. endocytosed staphylococcus was often associated with cytoplasmic claudin-4 vesicles; this was not found for yersinia, suggesting that  cytokine treatment upregulated two distinct endocytosis pathways. interestingly,  when staphylococcus and yersinia were coincubated with epithelial monolayers, the cells were unlikely to take up yersinia unless they had also endocytosed large numbers of staphylococcus particles, although the two bacteria were apparently processed in distinct compartments. cytokine treatment induced an upregulation and redistribution of beta1 integrin to the apical surface of nci-h292 cells; consistent with this effect, treatment with anti-beta1 integrin antibody blocked  uptake of both yersinia and staphylococcus in nci-h292 and caco-2bbe cells. our results suggest that capture of bacterial particles by mucosal epithelial cells is selective and that different endocytic mechanisms are enhanced by proinflammatory cytokines.

TI  == effects of pulsed electric fields on pathogenic microorganisms of major concern in fluid foods: a review.
AB  == pathogenic microorganisms such as escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella spp., listeria monocytogenes, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, yersinia enterocolitica, and campylobacter jejuni have been implicated in foodborne diseases and outbreaks worldwide. these bacteria have been associated with the consumption of fresh fruit juices, milk, and dairy products, which are foodstuff, highly demanded by consumers in retails and supermarkets. nowadays, consumers require high quality, fresh-like, and safe foods. pulsed electric field (pef) is  a non-thermal preservation method, able to inactivate pathogenic microorganisms without significant loss of the organoleptic and nutritional properties of food.  the pef treatment effectiveness to destroy bacteria such as listeria innocua, e.  coli, salmonella typhimurium, e. coli o157:h7 and e. coli 8739 at pasteurization  levels (> or = 5.0 log(10) cycles) in some fluid foods was reported. however, data on the inactivation of some microorganisms such as bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, yersinia enterocolitica, and campylobacter jejuni in fluid foods by pef processing is very limited. therefore, future works should be focused toward the inactivation of these pathogenic bacteria in real foods.

AB  == strain nrrl b-30745, isolated from chicken ceca and identified as enterococcus durans, enterococcus faecium, or enterococcus hirae, was initially identified as  antagonistic to campylobacter jejuni. the isolate produced a 5,362-da bacteriocin (enterocin) that inhibits the growth of salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis,  s. enterica serovar choleraesuis, s. enterica serovar typhimurium, s. enterica serovar gallinarum, escherichia coli o157:h7, yersinia enterocolitica, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae, shigella dysenteriae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, listeria monocytogenes, campylobacter jejuni, and 20  other campylobacter species isolates. the enterocin, e-760, was isolated and purified by cation-exchange and hydrophobic-interaction chromatographies. the proteinaceous nature of purified enterocin e-760 was demonstrated upon treatment  with various proteolytic enzymes. specifically, the antimicrobial peptide was found to be sensitive to beta-chymotrypsin, proteinase k, and papain, while it was resistant to lysozyme and lipase. the enterocin demonstrated thermostability  by retaining activity after 5 min at 100 degrees c and was stable at ph values between 5.0 and 8.7. however, activity was lost below ph 3.0 and above ph 9.5. administration of enterocin e-760-treated feed significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the colonization of young broiler chicks experimentally challenged and colonized  with two strains of c. jejuni by more than 8 log(10) cfu. enterocin e-760 also significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the colonization of naturally acquired campylobacter species in market age broiler chickens when administered in treated feed 4 days prior to analysis.

TI  == bacteria induce ctgf and cyr61 expression in epithelial cells in a lysophosphatidic acid receptor-dependent manner.
AB  == cysteine-rich protein 61 (cyr61/ccn1) and connective tissue growth factor (ctgf/ccn2) are members of the ccn (cyr61, ctgf, nephroblastoma overexpressed gene) family and exert pleiotropic functions such as regulation of adhesion, migration, extracellular matrix deposition, or cell differentiation, and play an  important role in wound healing. this study focused on the nature of the so far unknown ctgf and cyr61 mrna expression of epithelial cells after infection with bacteria. we demonstrate that infection of epithelial cells with attenuated yersinia enterocolitica lacking the virulence plasmid pyv leads to the expression of cyr61 and ctgf. virulent y. enterocolitica bearing the pyv virulence plasmid suppressed the mrna expression of these genes. yersinia-mediated inhibition of ctgf and cyr61 mrna expression is partially mediated by the cysteine protease yopt. further characterization of the yersinia factors, which trigger ctgf and cyr61 mrna expression, demonstrated that these factors were secreted and could be enriched in lipid extracts. beside yersinia, several other bacteria such as escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, or staphylococcus aureus, as well as supernatants of these bacteria induced ctgf and cyr61 expression. blocking experiments with the lysophosphatidic acid (lpa) receptor-specific inhibitor ki16425 suggest a general involvement of lpa receptors in bacteria-triggered ctgf and cyr61 expression. these data suggest that lpa receptor-dependent expression of ctgf and cyr61 represents a common host response after interaction with bacteria.

AB  == the effect of aqueous chlorine dioxide (clo(2)) on controlling foodborne pathogens, yeasts, and molds on blueberries was studied. five pathogens were spot-inoculated on the skin of blueberries. a sachet containing necessary chemicals for generation of clo(2) was used to provide 320 ppm of clo(2) in 7.5 l of water. the efficacy of different concentrations (1, 3, 5, 10, and 15 ppm) of clo(2) and various contact times (10s; 1, 5, 10, 20, 30 min; and 1h and 2h) were  studied. clo(2) was most effective in reducing listeria monocytogenes (4.88 log cfu/g) as compared to the other pathogens. pseudomonas aeruginosa was reduced by  2.16 log cfu/g after 5 min when treated with 15 ppm of clo(2). relatively short treatment time was more effective in reducing salmonella typhimurium than longer  treatment time for most concentrations. the highest reduction (4.56 log cfu/g) of staphylococcus aureus was achieved with 15 ppm of clo(2) for 30 min. when treated for 2h with 5 ppm of clo(2), yersinia enterocolitica was reduced by 3.49 log cfu/g. fifteen ppm of clo(2) reduced natural yeasts and molds by 2.82 log cfu/g after 1h. concentrations of clo(2) decreased over time. when exposed to blueberries, clo(2) concentrations were further reduced, showing significant degradation.

TI  == vapor-phase activities of cinnamon, thyme, and oregano essential oils and key constituents against foodborne microorganisms.
AB  == the aim of the study presented here was to gain knowledge about the vapor-phase antimicrobial activity of selected essential oils and their major putatively active constituents against a range of foodborne bacterial and fungal strains. in a first step, the vapor-phase antimicrobial activities of three commercially available essential oils (eos)-cinnamon (cinnamomum zeylanicum), thyme (thymus vulgaris), and oregano (origanum vulgare)-were evaluated against a wide range of  microorganisms, including gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, yersinia enterocolitica, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and salmonella choleraesuis), gram-positive bacteria (listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, and enterococcus faecalis), molds (penicillium islandicum and aspergillus flavus), and a yeast (candida albicans). the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were generally lower for oregano eo than for the thyme and cinnamon eos, especially against the relatively resistant gram-negative. the persistence of the eos' antimicrobial activities over time was assessed, and changes in the composition of the atmosphere they generated over time were determined using single-drop microextraction (sdme) in combination with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (gc-ms) and subsequent analysis of the data by principal component analysis (pca). more relevant chemicals were selected. in addition, the vapor-phase activities of putatively key constituents of the oils were screened against representative gram-positive (l. monocytogenes) and gram-negative (s. choleraesuis) bacteria, a mold (a. flavus), and a yeast (c. albicans). of the tested compounds, cinnamaldehyde, thymol, and carvacrol showed the strongest antimicrobial effectiveness, so their mics, defined as the minimum vapor concentrations that completely inhibited detectable growth of the microorganisms, were calculated. to check for possible interactions between components present in the eos, cinnamon eo was fortified with cinnamaldehyde and thyme eo with thymol,  and then the antimicrobial activities of the fortified oils were compared to those of the respective unfortified eos using fractional inhibitory concentration (fic) indices and by plotting inhibition curves as functions of the vapor-phase concentrations. synergistic effects were detected for cinnamaldehyde on a. flavus and for thymol on l. monocytogenes, s. choleraesuis, and a. flavus. in all other  cases the fortification had additive effects, except for cinnamaldehyde's activity against s. choleraesuis, for which the effect was antagonistic. finally, various microorganisms were found to cause slight changes over time to the atmospheres generated by all of the eos (fortified and unfortified) except the fortified cinnamon eo.

TI  == albomycin is an effective antibiotic, as exemplified with yersinia enterocolitica and streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == albomycin belongs to the class of sideromycins, compounds composed of iron carriers linked to antibiotic moieties. albomycin was found to be active against  bacteria that have a functional ferric hydroxamate transport system meaning that  bacteria will actively transport albomycin until they die. we examined the activity spectrum of albomycin for bacterial pathogens and found that enterobacteriaceae except species of proteus and morganella were sensitive. resistance in the two genera was due to the lack of the ferric hydroxamate transport system. among gram-positive bacteria, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae were highly sensitive, whereas streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pyogenes, and staphylococcus epidermidis were resistant. the in vivo efficacy of albomycin was examined in mice infected with s. pneumoniae or yersinia enterocolitica. a single dose of 10mg albomycin/kg body weight reduced the colony-forming units of y. enterocolitica by three to four orders of magnitude. a single dose of 1mg albomycin/kg body weight was sufficient to clear  s. pneumoniae infections in mice. in direct competition experiments with wild-type s. pneumoniae and its albomycin-resistant mutant, the recovery rate of  the mutant was lower than for the wild-type indicating that the mutant had reduced fitness in the mouse model. we conclude that albomycin is effective in clearing infections caused by both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria in a  mouse model. albomycin treatment reduces the bacterial load allowing the immune system to remove residual albomycin-resistant bacteria, and as such would make albomycin-based antibiotics an adjunct to treatment. the ferrichrome transport system serves as a trojan horse to get albomycin into bacteria.

AB  == large-conductance ca(2+)-activated k(+) (bk) channels are reported to be essential for nadph oxidase-dependent microbial killing and innate immunity in leukocytes. using human peripheral blood and mouse bone marrow neutrophils, pharmacological targeting, and bk channel gene-deficient (bk(-/-)) mice, we stimulated nadph oxidase activity with 12-o-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (pma) and performed patch-clamp recordings on isolated neutrophils. although pma stimulated nadph oxidase activity as assessed by o(2)(-) and h(2)o(2) production, our patch-clamp experiments failed to show pma-activated bk channel currents in neutrophils. in our studies, pma induced slowly activating currents, which were insensitive to the bk channel inhibitor iberiotoxin. instead, the currents were blocked by zn(2+), which indicates activation of proton channel currents. bk channels are gated by elevated intracellular ca(2+) and membrane depolarization.  we did not observe bk channel currents, even during extreme depolarization to +140 mv and after elevation of intracellular ca(2+) by n-formyl-l-methionyl-l-leucyl-phenylalanine. as a control, we examined bk channel currents in cerebral and tibial artery smooth muscle cells, which showed characteristic bk channel current pharmacology. iberiotoxin did not block killing of staphylococcus aureus or candida albicans. moreover, we addressed the role of  bk channels in a systemic s. aureus and yersinia enterocolitica mouse infection model. after 3 and 5 days of infection, we found no differences in the number of  bacteria in spleen and kidney between bk(-/-) and bk(+/+) mice. in conclusion, our experiments failed to identify functional bk channels in neutrophils. we therefore conclude that bk channels are not essential for innate immunity.

AB  == the genotypic and phenotypic variability of 40 lactococcus lactis isolates obtained from three cheese-making trials of batzos cheese made one in each, winter, spring and summer was investigated. rapd-pcr, plasmid profiling and pfge  were used to study the genetic variability and distinguish closely related isolates. results showed a high degree of heterogeneity among strains. according  to pfge data, all strains except one were clustered together (at a similarity level of approximately 50%) with the l. lactis subsp. lactis reference strain and eleven groups of isolates consisting of 2-8 strains each were distinguished. plasmid profiling results revealed that there were eight isolates lacking plasmids and nine having unique plasmids. twenty-three isolates were allocated into six groups. there was an interesting similarity between the plasmid profiling groups and those formed according to pfge. clustering of strains according to rapd-pcr was in agreement with results obtained by both plasmid profiling and pfge for the majority of the strains. in addition, results obtained by molecular methods indicate a grouping of most of the strains according to the  season of cheese production. all strains inhibited the growth of escherichia coli o157:h7. their ability to affect the growth of yersinia enterocolitica, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, listeria monocytogenes and enterococcus faecalis was strain dependent. in 42.5% of the isolates high acidifying ability in milk after 24 h was recorded and these were isolates, mainly, from fresh cheese. the 75% of the isolates from winter cheese exhibited higher lys- than leu-aminopeptidase activity while the approximately 67% of the isolates from summer cheese showed higher leu- than lys-aminopeptidase activity. their caseinolytic activity after growth in milk for 24 h was significant with preference for alpha(s)-casein degradation. the majority (90%) of the strains formed methanethiol from methionine and this ability was strain dependent. these  results suggest that among the wild lactococcal population from batzos cheese there are interesting strains appropriate to be used as starters for the dairy industry.

AB  == bacterial contamination of blood and its cellular components remains an unresolved problem in transfusion medicine and is considered to be the most common microbiological cause of transfusion associated morbidity and mortality. the present work was designed to explore the levels of two bioactive compounds interleukin-1 beta (il-1beta) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (pai-1) in stored blood units and their relation to bacterial contamination of these units.  this study was conducted on 112 blood units obtained from blood bank of mansoura  university children hospital. sequential blood samples were obtained both immediately at donation and after 10 days for measurement of il-1beta and pai-1 and for bacterial culture by bactec 9050 system. there was statistically significant increase in both il-1 beta and pai-1 (p = 0.0001) after 10 days of blood units storage. bacteriological culture revealed no growth in 68% and positive growth in 32% of blood units. the commonest isolated organism was staphylococcus aureus (15%) followed by staphylococcus epidermedis (13%) then yersinia sp. and enterobacter sp. (2%) for each. from the present study we could  conclude that stored blood units contain platelets and wbcs derived bioactive substances pai-1 and il-1beta which increase with the duration of blood storage.  furthermore, the extended duration of storage carries the danger of blood contamination by bacteria. automated blood culture system seems to be helpful in  identification of bacterial contamination of blood units. we recommend fresh blood transfusion as early as possible and the practice of leucofiltration to avoid blood transfusion complications.

TI  == rapid separation and concentration of food-borne pathogens in food samples prior  to quantification by viable-cell counting and real-time pcr.
AB  == buoyant density gradient centrifugation has been used to separate bacteria from complex food matrices, as well as to remove compounds that inhibit rapid detection methods, such as pcr, and to prevent false-positive results due to dna  originating from dead cells. applying a principle of buoyant density gradient centrifugation, we developed a method for rapid separation and concentration following filtration and low- and high-speed centrifugation, as well as flotation and sedimentation buoyant density centrifugation, for 12 food-borne pathogens (salmonella enterica, escherichia coli, yersinia enterocolitica, campylobacter jejuni, vibrio cholerae o139, vibrio parahaemolyticus o3k6, vibrio vulnificus, providencia alcalifaciens, aeromonas hydrophila, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus  aureus, and clostridium perfringens) in 13 different food homogenates. this method can be used prior to real-time quantitative pcr (rti-qpcr) and viable-cell counting. using this combined method, the target organisms in the food samples theoretically could be concentrated 250-fold and detected at cell concentrations  as low as 10(1) to 10(3) cfu/g using the rti-qpcr assay, and amounts as small as  10(0) to 10(1) cfu/g could be isolated using plate counting. the combined separation and concentration methods and rti-qpcr confirmed within 3 h the presence of 10(1) to 10(2) cfu/g of salmonella and c. jejuni directly in naturally contaminated chicken and the presence of s. aureus directly in remaining food items in a poisoning outbreak. these results illustrated the feasibility of using these assays for rapid inspection of bacterial food contamination during a real-world outbreak.

TI  == sensitivity of three pathogenic bacteria to turkish cemen paste and its ingredients.
AB  == pastirma is a dry cured meat product which is pasted with cemen. this paste is prepared from ground fenugreek, garlic and red hot pepper (rhpp). in this study,  the cemen mix/paste and all its ingredients were tested for their inhibitory effects on escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus and yersinia enterocolitica. all samples had a varying inhibitory effect against all the bacteria tested during 4 days of storage. complete cemen paste showed the strongest inhibitory effect on the three pathogens compared to ingredients alone. fenugreek and rhpp had a bacteriostatic effect while the cemen paste and garlic had a bactericidal effect. s. aureus was the most sensitive bacterium while y. enterocolitica was the most resistant. the results of this study confirmed the protective effect of  cemen paste and garlic in food preservation especially against e. coli, s. aureus and y. enterocolitica proving safety for public health. hence it might be concluded that cemen paste is the first hurdle to prevent bacterial contamination, and a low ph ( approximately 4.83) value would also add an additional barrier to secure safety of the product. finally, it can be suggested  that similar studies should be conducted on actual meat systems to confirm these  findings.

TI  == differential sensitivities of pathogens in red cell concentrates to tri-p(4)-photoinactivation.
AB  == background and objectives: photodynamic treatment (pdt) with the cationic porphyrin, mono-phenyl-tri-(n-methyl-4-pyridyl)-porphyrin chloride [tri-p(4)], has previously been shown to be effective at inactivating vesicle stomatitis virus (vsv) in red cell concentrates (rcc) with limited damage to red blood cells (rbc). the aim of this study was to determine the pathogen-inactivating capacity  of pdt with tri-p(4) for a broader range of pathogens and to establish the associated effect on in vitro rbc quality. materials and methods: a series of viruses and bacteria was spiked into 60% rcc. pathogen inactivation was determined after pdt with 25 microm tri-p(4) and red light up to 360 kj/m2. human immunodeficiency virus (hiv)-infected cells were evaluated for cell death induction, and rcc were analysed for the induction of haemolysis and atp content. results: for the lipid-enveloped viruses bovine viral diarrhoea virus, hiv and pseudorabies virus, and for the gram positive bacterium, staphylococcus aureus, and the gram-negative bacteria, pseudomonas aeruginosa and yersinia enterolitica, inactivation of > or = 5 log10 was measured after 60 min of pdt with tri-p(4). the required treatment time to achieve this level of inactivation was four times  longer than required for vsv. for cell-associated hiv, only 1.7 log10 of inactivation was found, despite clear induction of cell death of hiv-infected cells. the non-enveloped virus, canine parvovirus, was completely resistant to the treatment. pdt of rcc with tri-p(4) for 60 min, and subsequent storage in as-3, resulted in 4% haemolysis after 35 days of storage. the atp content of untreated and treated rbc declined with similar kinetics during storage. conclusion: pdt of rcc with tri-p(4) for 60 min inactivates a wide range of pathogens, but not cell-associated hiv and a non-enveloped virus, and compromises rbc quality. this reduces the suitability of pdt with tri-p(4) for red cell sterilization. therefore, further improvements in the treatment procedures to potentiate pathogen inactivation and to preserve rbc integrity will be required to generate an effective treatment for sterilizing rcc.

TI  == antimicrobial and toxicological profile of the new biocide akacid plus.
AB  == objectives: akacid plus is a new member of the polymeric guanidine family of disinfectants. it was especially developed to enhance the antimicrobial activity  of this class with significantly less toxicity. the in vitro activity of akacid plus compared with chlorhexidine digluconate and mupirocin was tested against a total of 369 recent clinical isolates. methods: the organisms tested by clsi reference methods included the following: staphylococcus aureus (98), staphylococcus epidermidis (9), bacillus spp. (2), enterococcus faecalis (32), klebsiella spp. (45), enterobacter spp. (20), escherichia coli (65), salmonella spp. (6), shigella spp. (2), yersinia enterocolitica (1), acinetobacter spp. (4), proteus spp. (7), pseudomonas aeruginosa (59), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4),  candida spp. (10) and aspergillus spp. (7). in vitro selection of resistance to akacid plus was carried out on 24 strains. toxicological analyses were also performed. results: all tested agents were more effective against staphylococcus  spp. and bacillus spp. than against e. faecalis and gram-negative bacteria. the mic90s of chlorhexidine and mupirocin showed a 4-fold and 32-fold increase for methicillin-resistant s. aureus in comparison with methicillin-susceptible strains, while mic values of akacid plus were similar for antibiotic-susceptible  and multiresistant strains. bactericidal action of akacid plus was observed at 1-2x mic. the in vitro selection of resistance test showed no increase in mic values of akacid plus for any isolate after 30 passages. in addition, akacid plus showed low oral and dermal toxicity. conclusions: these preliminary results demonstrate the broad antimicrobial properties of akacid plus, which makes it a promising tool for topical application in the prophylaxis and treatment of bacterial and fungal infections.

AB  == background: the prevalence of bacterial contamination of random-donor platelet concentrates (pcs) is considerably lower than that of blood donations. which key  steps of the preparation procedure contribute to the elimination of bacteria was  investigated. study design and methods: ten bacteria species were used. blood donations were spiked with bacteria and stored at 22 degrees c for 8 hours. the buffy coats were kept for 6 hours. pcs were prepared from pools of 4 buffy coats. at each preparation step and during pc storage, bacteria contents were measured.  in additional experiments, the titers of spiked blood and buffy coats were determined after storage at 20, 22, or 24 degrees c for 8 and up to 24 hours, respectively. results: enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, and yersinia enterocolitica were completely inactivated during storage in blood or buffy coats. titer reduction was between 3.32 and 4.62 log. bacillus cereus, propionibacterium acnes, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis did not multiply. compared with their values in spiked blood the titers in the pcs were reduced by 1.7 to 2.8 log. klebsiella pneumoniae was the only species that grew in blood. with the exception of p. acnes, those species that were not removed by the preparation process multiplied in the pcs. remarkable donor-to-donor variations of the bactericidal activities of buffy coats were detected when the storage time was prolonged to 24 hours. conclusions: bacteria are significantly eliminated by the preparation procedure for random donor pcs. also, blood and buffy coats are bactericidal for  most species. when buffy-coat storage is prolonged, it cannot, however, be predicted whether specific strains vanish or multiply.

AB  == the antibacterial working range of six lysozymes was tested under ambient and high pressure, on a panel of five gram-positive (enterococcus faecalis, bacillus  subtilis, listeria innocua, staphylococcus aureus and micrococcus lysodeikticus)  and five gram-negative bacteria (yersinia enterocolitica, shigella flexneri, escherichia coli o157:h7, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella typhimurium). the lysozymes included two that are commercially available (hen egg white lysozyme or hewl, and mutanolysin from streptomyces globisporus or m1l), and four that were chromatographically purified (bacteriophage lambda lysozyme or lal, bacteriophage t4 lysozyme or t4l, goose egg white lysozyme or gewl, and cauliflower lysozyme or cfl). t4l, lal and gewl were highly pure as evaluated by silver staining of sds-page gels and zymogram analysis while cfl was only partially pure. at ambient pressure each gram-positive test organism displayed a specific pattern of sensitivity to the six lysozymes, but none of the gram-negative bacteria was sensitive to any of the lysozymes. high pressure treatment (130-300 mpa, 25 degrees c, 15 min) sensitised several gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria for one or more lysozymes. m. lysodeikticus and p. aeruginosa became sensitive to all lysozymes under high pressure, s. typhimurium remained completely insensitive to all lysozymes, and the other bacteria showed sensitisation to some of the lysozymes. the possible applications of the different lysozymes as biopreservatives, and the possible reasons for the observed differences in bactericidal specificity are discussed.

TI  == sensitivities of foodborne pathogens to pressure changes.
AB  == eight foodborne pathogens were suspended in ultrahigh-temperature whole milk and  treated at pressure levels of 0.1 to 690 mpa at 21.5 degrees c for 10 min. there  was no clear trend in pressure resistance between gram-negative and gram-positive organisms. the order of the single strains tested, from most to least pressure sensitive, was vibrio parahaemolyticus < yersinia enterocolitica < listeria monocytogenes < salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium < s. enterica serovar enteritidis < escherichia coli o157:h7 approximately equal to staphylococcus aureus < shigella flexneri. for each organism there existed a pressure range in which log(number of survivors) had a near linear relationship when plotted versus treatment pressure level. in this study, a decimal reduction pressure (dp) value  was defined and used to measure the sensitivity of these pathogens to pressure changes. l. monocytogenes and v. parahaemolyticus were most sensitive to pressure changes, and s. flexneri was most resistant. the d(p) values were 16.3 mpa for l. monocytogenes, 21.7 mpa for v. parahaemolyticus, and 127.0 mpa for s. flexneri. the most pressure-resistant gram-negative bacterium, s. flexneri, and most pressure-resistant gram-positive bacterium, s. aureus, were treated at 50 degrees c and pressures of 0.1 to 650 mpa for 10 min. high temperature considerably enhanced pressure inactivation of these two organisms and affected their sensitivities to pressure changes. the effect of treatment time on the d(p) values of l. monocytogenes and v. parahaemolyticus was also determined, and it was found that it did not significantly affect their d(p) values.

TI  == basics of flow cytometry-based sterility testing of platelet concentrates.
AB  == background: flow cytometry (facs) is a common technique in blood banking. it is used, for example, for the enumeration of residual white blood cells in plasma and in cellular blood products. it was investigated whether it can also be applied for sterility testing of buffy coat-derived platelet concentrates (pcs).  study design and methods: plasma-reduced pcs were spiked with bacteria and stored at 20 to 24 or 37 degrees c for various times. the following 10 species were used: bacillus cereus, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, propionibacterium acnes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, serratia marcescens, and yersinia enterocolitica. bacterial dna was stained with thiazole orange. after the platelets were lysed, bacteria were enumerated by facs. results: all bacteria species used were detectable by facs. the lower detection limit was approximately 100 bacteria per microl, that is, 10(5) per ml. in general, the titers measured were 1.2- to 3-fold higher than those determined by colony forming assay. in one  case (k. pneumoniae) in which the dot plot of the bacteria cloud overlapped with  that of bacteria debris, they were consistently lower. when pc samples were inoculated with approximately 1 colony-forming unit per ml of bacteria and kept at 37 degrees c, most species were detected within 21 hours or less. exceptions were e. cloacae and p. acnes, which were detected after 24 to 40 and 64 hours, respectively. at 20 to 24 degrees c, the detection times were strongly prolonged. conclusion: sterility testing of pcs by facs is a feasible approach. the present  data suggest incubating pc samples for 20 to 24 hours at 37 degrees c before testing. for slow-growing bacteria, the incubation period must be prolonged by 1  to 2 days.

AB  == using standard microbiological procedures, bacteria that are potentially pathogenic to humans were isolated from 150 houseflies collected in the libyan city of misurata (50 flies each from the central hospital, streets and abattoir). salmonella spp., yersinia enterocolitica and edwardsiella tarda were isolated from flies collected on the streets and in the abattoir but not from those collected in the hospital. shigella sonnei was detected in just one fly, which was collected in the abattoir. of the flies collected in the hospital, streets and abattor, 42%, 42% and 32% were positive for escherichia coli, 70%, 50% and 62% for klebsiella spp., 2%, 20% and 10% for aeromonas spp., 96%, 36% and 34% for pseudomonas spp., 20%, 12% and 16% for staphylococcus spp., and 24%, 22% and 18%  for streptococcus spp., respectively. when the antibiotic susceptibilities of the fly isolates were investigated, the enterobacteria isolated from the houseflies collected in the hospital were found to be resistant to significantly more of the commonly used antibiotics that were tested than the enterobacteria isolated from  the flies caught in the streets or abattoir. whatever the source of the flies from which they were collected, the pseudomonas isolates frequently showed resistance to multiple antibiotics, with >50% each being resistant to at least 10 antimicrobial agents. two isolates of sta. aureus (both from flies collected in the hospital) were resistant to methicillin. the present study supports the belief that the housefly is a potential vector of multiple-antibiotic-resistant,  pathogenic bacteria, including methicillin-resistant sta. aureus, in the hospital environment. given their mobility, it seems likely that houseflies carry such pathogens from hospitals to surrounding communities, and vice versa.

AB  == the serratia marcescens hemolysin represents the prototype of a growing family of pore forming toxins. the available bacterial genome sequences reveal serratia hemolysin homologues in additional species. however, only s. marcescens hemolysin has been studied in great molecular detail. this family of toxins has nothing in  common with the pore forming toxins of e. coli type (rtx toxins), the staphylococcus aureus alpha-toxin or the thiol activated toxin of group a beta-hemolytic streptococci (streptolysin o). studies on erythrocytes, eukaryotic cells and artificial black lipid membranes, have shown that the mechanism of pore formation of shla is different form other pore forming toxins. the s. marcescens  hemolysin proteins shlb and shla, exhibit protein sequence homologues in proteus  mirabilis, haemophilus ducreyi, yersinia pestis, yersinia enterocolitica, edwardsiella tarda, photorhabdus luminescens and xylella fastidiosa . the family  of serratia type pore forming toxins show a unique secretory mechanism which has  been described as a two partner secretion system (tpss) or type v-secretion system. not only serratia type pore forming toxins are secreted via tpss but also adhesins from bordetella pertussis, erwinia chrysanthemi and haemophilus influenzae. the uniqueness of the serratia family is underlined by the fact that  activation of shla by shlb strictly requires phosphatidylethanolamine as a cofactor. and, quite unusual, shla undergoes a conformational change during activation.

TI  == simultaneous display of multiple foreign peptides in the flid capping and flic filament proteins of the escherichia coli flagellum.
AB  == the bacterial flagellum is composed of more than 20 different proteins. the filament, which constitutes the major extracellular part of the flagellum, is built up of approximately 20,000 flic molecules that assemble at the growing distal end of the filament. a capping structure composed of five flid molecules located at the tip of the filament promotes polymerization of flic. lack of flid  leads to release of the subunits into the growth medium. we show here that flid can be successfully used in bacterial surface display. we tested various insertion sites in the capping protein, and the optimal region for display was at the variable region in flid. deletion and/or insertion at other sites resulted in decreased formation of flagella. we further developed the technique into a multihybrid display system in which three foreign peptides are simultaneously expressed within the same flagellum, i.e., d repeats of fnbpa from staphylococcus aureus at the tip and fragments of yada from yersinia enterocolitica as well as slpa from lactobacillus crispatus along the filament. this technology can have biotechnological applications, e.g., in simultaneous delivery of several effector molecules.

TI  == food safety knowledge of consumers and the microbiological and temperature status of their refrigerators.
AB  == the objectives of this study were to examine domestic food safety knowledge levels of consumers, establish the levels and incidence of bacterial contamination and operational temperatures in domestic refrigerators, and identify areas in which consumer food safety education is necessary in ireland. a food safety knowledge questionnaire applied to a representative sample of households (n = 1,020) throughout the island of ireland found the gaps in consumer food safety knowledge. analysis of swab samples (n = 900) recovered from the domestic refrigerators in these households showed average total viable counts of 7.1 log cfu/cm2 and average total coliform counts of 4.0 log cfu/cm2. analysis of swab samples also detected the incidence of staphylococcus aureus (41%), escherichia coli (6%), salmonella enterica (7%), listeria monocytogenes (6%), and yersinia enterocolitica (2%). campylobacter jejuni and e. coli o157:h7 were not detected in domestic refrigerators. the temperature profiles of a subset of the sampled refrigerators (100) were monitored for 72 h, and 59% were found to operate, on average, at temperatures above the recommended 5 degrees c. knowledge and temperature survey results varied considerably, but consumers who scored better in terms of basic food safety knowledge had reduced levels of bacterial contamination in their refrigerators and reported a reduced incidence of food-associated illnesses. this study confirms the effect of basic food hygiene knowledge on hygienic practice and identifies specific areasfor emphasis in the development and delivery of effective food safety risk communication messages to  consumers.

TI  == accelerating bacterial identification by infrared spectroscopy by employing microarray deposition of microorganisms.
AB  == a microarray method for the deposition of bacteria onto an agar slide was developed to accelerate the formation of microcolonies. representative microarrays each consisting of 40 micro-spots of five replicates of eight foodborne bacteria (yersinia enterocolitica, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella typhimurium, listeria monocytogenes, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii,  klebsiella pneumoniae, and escherichia coli) were printed on a brain heart infusion (bhi) agar slide using a contact micro-spotting robotic system. within 3 h, sufficient bacterial cells were obtained to allow accurate identification of the microorganism by infrared spectroscopy. this approach allows a "complete-in-a-single-day" analysis of a large array of samples.

AB  == moxifloxacin (bay 12-8039) is a new 8 methoxy quinolone antibacterial. the mic90  values are < or = 0.25 mg/l for streptococcus pneumoniae (irrespective of penicillin susceptibility), haemophilus influenzae (beta-lactamase positive or negative), morexella catarrhalis, bordetella pertussis, legionella sp., mycoplasma pneumoniae, clamydia pneumoniae, mycobacterium tuberculosis, methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, beta-haemolytic streptococci (macrolide-sensitive or -resistant), listeria sp., most enterobacteriaceae, salmonella sp., shigella sp., neisseria gonorrhoeae, n. menigitidis, pasteurella  spp., vibrio spp. and yersinia enterocolitica. for mycobacterium intracellularae, methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), ciprofloxacin-resistant s. aureus, citrobacter freundii, providencia sp., serratia sp., p. aeruginosa and other non-fermentive gram-negative rods, mic90s are in the range 0.5-4 mg/l. for anaerobic bacteria species, mic90s are also in the range 0.25-4 mg/l. moxifloxacin is bactericidal at concentrations 2- to 4-fold higher than the mic and is rapidly bactericidal against most common pathogen groups at concentrations achieved in serum with a 400 mg dose that is between 0.5-4 mg/l. there is a post-antibiotic effect against gram-positive and -negative bacteria. resistant mutants are at present difficult to select in the laboratory but in general, moxifloxacin has poorer activity against strains resistant to ciprofloxacin compared to those which are susceptible. animal and laboratory pharmacodynamic models indicate that the mic and area under the serum concentration time curve predict outcome. various animal models mainly of respiratory tract infection indicate equivalent or superior results compared to existing or other developmental agents. human pharmacokinetics in healthy volunteers indicate linear pharmacokinetics over the dose range 50-800 mg/day. a single dose of 400 mg produces a maximum serum concentration of 2.5-4.5 mg/l, half-life of 11-15 h,  auc of 25-40 mg x h/l and volume of distribution of 2.5-3.5 l/kg. protein binding is about 50% and two metabolites have been identified (m-1 and m-2). bioavailability is > 85% and a minority of clearance is via the kidneys. no dose  modification is required in renal impairment. extra vascular penetration, where studied, is comparable to that of other quinolones. at present undergoing clinical trials, with a focus on respiratory tract infection, it is likely that moxifloxacin will provide effective therapy for pathogens with mics of < or = 0.25-0.5 mg/l. the safety profile in a large number of human subjects is awaited.

TI  == photochemical treatment of platelet concentrates with amotosalen and long-wavelength ultraviolet light inactivates a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == background: bacterial contamination of platelet (plt) concentrates can result in  transfusion-transmitted sepsis. a photochemical treatment (pct) process with amotosalen hcl and long-wavelength ultraviolet light (uva), which cross-links nucleic acids, was developed to inactivate bacteria and other pathogens in plt concentrates. study design and methods: high titers of pathogenic aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive bacteria (10 species), aerobic gram-negative bacteria (7  species), and spirochetes (2 species) were added to single-donor plt concentrates containing 3.0 x 10(11) to 6.0 x 10(11) plts in approximately 300 ml of 35 percent plasma and 65 percent plt additive solution (intersol, baxter healthcare) or saline. after pct with 150 micro mol per l amotosalen and 3 j per cm(2) uva, residual bacterial levels were detected by sensitive microbiologic methods. results: the level of inactivation of viable bacteria was expressed as log reduction. log reduction of gram-positive bacteria for staphylococcus epidermidis was > 6.6; for staphylococcus aureus, 6.6; for streptococcus pyogenes, > 6.8; for listeria monocytogenes, > 6.3; for corynebacterium minutissimum, > 6.3; for bacillus cereus (vegetative), > 5.5; for lactobacillus sp., > 6.4; for bifidobacterium adolescentis, > 6.0; for propionibacterium acnes, > 6.2; and for  clostridium perfringens, > 6.5. log reduction of gram-negative bacteria for escherichia coli was > 6.4; for serratia marcescens, > 6.7; for klebsiella pneumoniae, > 5.6; for pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4.5; for salmonella choleraesuis,  > 6.2; for yersinia enterocolitica, > 5.9; and for enterobacter cloacae, 5.9. log reduction of spirochetes for treponema pallidum was 6.8 to 7.0, and for borrelia  burgdorferi, > 6.9. conclusion: pct inactivates high levels of a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria. the inactivation of bacteria in plt concentrates offers the potential to prospectively prevent plt-transfusion-associated bacteremia.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of reuterin in combination with nisin against food-borne pathogens.
AB  == antimicrobial activity of reuterin individually or in combination with nisin against different food-borne gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens in milk was investigated. reuterin (8 au/ml) exhibited bacteriostatic activity against listeria monocytogenes, whereas its activity was slightly bactericidal against staphylococcus aureus at 37 degrees c. higher bactericidal activity was detected  against escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella choleraesuis subsp. choleraesuis, yersinia enterocolitica, aeromonas hydrophila subsp. hydrophila and campylobacter jejuni. a significant synergistic effect on l. monocytogenes and a slight additive effect on s. aureus after 24 h at 37 degrees c were observed when reuterin was combined with nisin (100 iu/ml). the combination of reuterin with nisin did not enhance the antimicrobial effect of reuterin against gram-negative  pathogens.

TI  == application of oligonucleotide array technology for the rapid detection of pathogenic bacteria of foodborne infections.
AB  == a rapid and accurate method for detection for common pathogenic bacteria in foodborne infections was established by using oligonucleotide array technology. nylon membrane was used as the array support. a mutation region of the 23s rrna gene was selected as the discrimination target from 14 species (genera) of bacteria causing foodborne infections and two unrelated bacterial species. a pair of universal primers was designed for pcr amplification of the 23s rrna gene. twenty-one species (genera)-specific oligonucleotide detection probes were synthesized and spotted onto the nylon membranes. the 23s rrna gene amplification products of 14 species of pathogenic bacteria were hybridized to the oligonucleotide array. hybridization results were analyzed with digoxigenin-linked enzyme reaction. results indicated that nine species of pathogenic bacteria (escherichia coli, campylobacter jejuni, shigella dysenteriae, vibrio cholerae, vibrio parahaemolyticus, proteus vulgaris, bacillus cereus, listeria monocytogenes and clostridium botulinum) showed high sensitivity and specificity for the oligonucleotide array. two other species (salmonella enterica and yersinia enterocolitica) gave weak cross-reaction with e. coli, but  the reaction did not affect their detection. after redesigning the probes, positive hybridization results were obtained with staphylococcus aureus, but not  with clostridium perfringens and streptococcus pyogenes. the oligonucleotide array can also be applied to samples collected in clinical settings of foodborne  infections. the superiority of oligonucleotide array over other tests lies on its rapidity, accuracy and efficiency in the diagnosis, treatment and control of foodborne infections.

AB  == the purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of selected essential  oils for the control of growth and survival of pathogenic microorganisms of significant importance in food hygiene and to determine whether the antimicrobial effect was due to the major compounds of the oils. mic and mbc were determined by the tube dilution method. essential oils from thymus vulgaris from spain and france, salvia sclarea, salvia officinalis, salvia lavandulifolia, lavandula latifolia, lavandula angustifolia, three hybrids of lavandula latifolia x lavandula angustifolia (lavandin 'super', lavandin 'abrialis', and lavandin 'grosso'), rosmarinus officinalis, hissopus officinalis, and satureja montana were evaluated. inhibition ranged from the strong activity of satureja montana and thymus vulgaris (france) to no inhibition with salvia sclarea and hissopus officinalis for each of the test strains: salmonella enteritidis, salmonella typhimurium, escherichia coli o157:h7, yersinia enterocolitica, shigella flexneri, listeria monocytogenes serovar 4b, and staphylococcus aureus. because some of the essential oils were highly inhibitory in small quantities to selected pathogenic microorganisms, they may provide alternatives to conventional antimicrobial additives in foods.

TI  == sensitization of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria to jenseniin g by sublethal injury.
AB  == jenseniin g, a bacteriocin produced by propionibacterium thoenii p126, is active  against related propionibacteria and some lactic acid bacteria and is sporostatic to botulinal spores. the objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of sublethal stress on jenseniin g activity. bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella typhimurium, shigella flexneri, staphylococcus aureus, and yersinia enterocolitica were subjected to temperature, acid, and osmotic stresses in the presence of jenseniin g. the bacteriocin reduced the viability of sublethally injured cultures, although the extent of reduction varied with strain and treatment. e. faecalis was the most sensitive to temperature stress; no reduction of viable counts occurred in the absence of jenseniin g, and a 1.5-log reduction occurred in the presence of jenseniin g. b. cereus, l. monocytogenes, and s. aureus were more sensitive to jenseniin g when exposed to heat stress than when exposed to cold stress, whereas e. coli, salmonella typhimurium, and s. flexneri were more sensitive to jenseniin g when exposed to cold stress than when exposed to heat stress. when comparing an acid stress test alone to a combination of acid stress and jenseniin g, e. faecalis and l. monocytogenes showed the greatest sensitivities with 4.87- and 2.82-log reductions, respectively, after 7 days. all cultures except for s. aureus were adversely affected by the combination of salt stress and jenseniin g. salmonella typhimurium showed the greatest sensitivity to salt stress with jenseniin g (a 1.54-log reduction at day 7) when compared to salt stress alone (a 0.55-log reduction at day 7). jenseniin g, like bacteriocins produced by other gram-positive species, has broader activity against stressed organisms.

AB  == biopreservatives are being developed to inhibit the growth of foodborne pathogens and thus improve food safety. the lactoperoxidase system (lps) is a naturally occurring system that has potential for use as an antimicrobial agent in foods. growth of single strains of the pathogens staphylococcus aureus, listeria monocytogenes, escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar typhimurium, yersinia enterocolitica, pseudomonas aeruginosa and beef microflora were assessed on lps-treated meat surfaces in an experimental system.  beef cubes inoculated with approximately 10(4) cfu cm(-2) of bacteria were treated with the lps and incubated at 37 degrees c for 24 h, 12 degrees c for 7 days or in a chilling regime: 12 to -1 degrees c over 1 week and held at -1 degrees c for 4 weeks. treatment with lps was more effective at storage temperatures non-permissive for rapid bacterial growth with strong inhibition of  growth achieved on lps-treated cubes at 12 degrees c and reduction in pathogen viable counts at chilling temperatures. at chilling temperatures, the lps inhibited the growth of native pseudomonads but did not prevent the development of native lactic acid bacteria.

TI  == identification of foodborne bacteria by infrared spectroscopy using cellular fatty acid methyl esters.
AB  == identification of bacterial species by profiling fatty acid methyl esters (fames) has commonly been carried out by using a 20-min capillary gas chromatographic procedure followed by library matching of fame profiles using commercial midi databases and proprietary pattern recognition software. fast gc (5 min) fame procedures and mass spectrometric methodologies that require no lipid separation  have also been reported. in this study, bacterial identification based on the rapid (2 min) infrared measurement of fame mixtures was demonstrated. the microorganisms investigated included gram positive bacteria staphylococcus aureus, listeria monocytogenes, bacillus anthracis, and bacillus cereus, and gram negative bacteria from the family enterobacteriacae: yersinia enterocolitica, salmonella typhimurium, shigella sonnei, and escherichia coli (four strains of e. coli), and non-enterobacteriacae: vibrio cholerae, vibrio vulnificus, and vibrio  parahemolyticus. foodborne bacterial mixtures of fames were measured by using an  attenuated total reflection (atr)-fourier transform infrared (ftir) spectroscopic procedure and discriminated by multivariate analysis. results showed that the enterobacteriacae could be discriminated from the vibrios. the identification was at the level of species (for the bacillus and vibrio genera) or strains (for the  e. coli species). a series of bacterial fame test samples were prepared and analyzed for accuracy of identification, and all were correctly identified. our results suggest that this infrared strategy could be used to identify foodborne pathogens.

TI  == consumer food-handling behaviors associated with prevention of 13 foodborne illnesses.
AB  == to be effective in reducing the incidence of foodborne illness, consumers and food safety educators need information about behaviors that will decrease exposure to foodborne pathogens. a four-round delphi technique was used to survey nationally recognized experts in food microbiology, epidemiology, food safety education, and food safety policy with the aim of identifying and ranking food-handling and consumption behaviors associated with 13 major foodborne pathogens. the food safety experts ranked behaviors related to keeping foods at safe temperatures as of primary importance in preventing illness caused by bacillus cereus and clostridium perfringens and of secondary importance in preventing illness caused by staphylococcus aureus. the use of a thermometer to cook foods adequately was ranked as of primary importance for the prevention of illness caused by campylobacter jejuni, salmonella species, escherichia coli o157:h7, toxoplasma gondii, and yersinia enterocolitica, with the avoidance of cross-contamination being ranked as of secondary importance for most of these pathogens. hand washing was the top-ranked behavior for the prevention of shigellosis. the avoidance of certain foods that are likely to be contaminated was the top-ranked behavior for the prevention of illnesses caused by listeria monocytogenes, noroviruses, and vibrio species. the expert panel's ranking of behaviors for the reduction of the risk of illness caused by major foodborne pathogens can enable consumers to make informed choices about food consumption and handling behaviors and can guide food safety educators in prioritizing their  educational efforts.

AB  == promethazine has been recognised as an effective antiplasmid agent in cultures containing a single bacterial species such as escherichia coli, yersinia enterocolitica, staphylococcus aureus and agrobacterium tumefaciens. the objective of this study was to examine the effect of heterogenity of the microbial flora on plasmid elimination by promethazine in a laboratory based model system of mixed bacterial infection. f'lac plasmid elimination of e. coli k12 le140 was studied in the presence of a numerically predominant gram-positive  species (bacillus cereus, staphylococcus epidermidis) by promethazine (0-120 mg/l) at 23, 37 and 39 degrees c. growth kinetics of different bacterial species  were studied at various temperatures without drug treatment in mixed bacterial cultures and it was found that the small number of added bacteria overgrew the pre-existing flora during the incubation period. we observed that bacterial-bacterial interactions modified the growth rate of individual bacterial species and gave selective advantages to some bacterial species of the microbial  community. some interactions between coexisting bacterial species enhanced the frequency of plasmid curing by promethazine in mixed cultures with s. epidermidis. in our experiments the plasmid curing action of promethazine was more effective at elevated temperature than at lower temperatures.

AB  == sodium caseinates prepared from bovine, sheep, goat, pig, buffalo or human milk were hydrolyzed by a partially purified proteinase of lactobacillus helveticus pr4. peptides in each hydrolysate were fractionated by reversed-phase fast-protein liquid chromatography. the fractions which showed the highest angiotensin i-converting-enzyme (ace)-inhibitory or antibacterial activity were sequenced by mass spectrum and edman degradation analyses. various ace-inhibitory peptides were found in the hydrolysates: the bovine alpha(s1)-casein (alpha(s1)-cn) 24-47 fragment (f24-47), f169-193, and beta-cn f58-76; ovine alpha(s1)-cn f1-6 and alpha(s2)-cn f182-185 and f186-188; caprine beta-cn f58-65  and alpha(s2)-cn f182-187; buffalo beta-cn f58-66; and a mixture of three tripeptides originating from human beta-cn. a mixture of peptides with a c-terminal sequence, pro-gly-pro, was found in the most active fraction of the pig sodium caseinate hydrolysate. the highest ace-inhibitory activity of some peptides corresponded to the concentration of the ace inhibitor (s)-n-(1-[ethoxycarbonyl]-3-phenylpropyl)-ala-pro maleate (enalapril) of 49.253 micro g/ml (100 micro mol/liter). several of the above sequences had features in  common with other ace-inhibitory peptides reported in the literature. the 50% inhibitory concentration (ic(50)) of some of the crude peptide fractions was very low (16 to 100 micro g/ml). some identified peptides were chemically synthesized, and the ace-inhibitory activity and ic(50)s were confirmed. an antibacterial peptide corresponding to beta-cn f184-210 was identified in human sodium caseinate hydrolysate. it showed a very large spectrum of inhibition against gram-positive and -negative bacteria, including species of potential clinical interest, such as enterococcus faecium, bacillus megaterium, escherichia coli, listeria innocua, salmonella spp., yersinia enterocolitica, and staphylococcus aureus. the mic for e. coli f19 was ca. 50 micro g/ml. once generated, the bioactive peptides were resistant to further degradation by proteinase of l. helveticus pr4 or by trypsin and chymotrypsin.

AB  == a pcr-based method and a reverse transcriptase pcr (rt-pcr)-based method were developed for the detection of pathogenic bacteria in organic waste, using salmonella spp., listeria monocytogenes, yersinia enterocolitica, and staphylococcus aureus as model organisms. in seeded organic waste samples, detection limits of less than 10 cells per g of organic waste were achieved after one-step enrichment of bacteria, isolation, and purification of dna or rna before pcr or rt-pcr amplification. to test the reproducibility and reliability of the newly developed methods, 46 unseeded samples were collected from diverse aerobic  (composting) facilities and anaerobic digestors and analyzed by both culture-based classical and newly developed pcr-based procedures. no false-positive but some false-negative results were generated by the pcr- or rt-pcr-based methods after one-step enrichment when compared to the classical detection methods. the results indicated that the level of activity of the tested bacteria in unseeded samples was very low compared to that of freshly inoculated  cells, preventing samples from reaching the cell density required for pcr-based detection after one-step enrichment. however, for salmonella spp., a distinct pcr product could be obtained for all 22 nonamended samples that tested positive for  salmonella spp. by the classical detection procedure when a selective two-step enrichment (20 h in peptone water at 37 degrees c and 24 h in rappaport vassiliadis medium at 43 degrees c) was performed prior to nucleic acid extraction and pcr. hence, the classical procedure was shortened, since cell plating and further differentiation of isolated colonies can be omitted, substituted for by highly sensitive and reliable detection based on nucleic acid  extraction and pcr. similarly, 2 of the 22 samples in which salmonella spp. were  detected also tested positive for listeria monocytogenes according to a two-step  enrichment procedure followed by pcr, compared to 3 samples that tested positive  when classical isolation procedures were followed. the study shows that selective two-step enrichment is useful when very low numbers of bacterial pathogens must be detected in organic waste materials, such as biosolids. there were no false-positive results derived from dna of dead cells in the waste sample, suggesting that it is not necessary to perform rt-pcr analyses when pcr is combined with selective enrichment. large numbers of added nontarget bacteria did not affect detection of salmonella spp., l. monocytogenes, and y. enterocolitica  but increased the detection limit of staphylococcus aureus from <10 to 10(4) cfu/g of organic waste. overall, the detection methods developed using seeded organic waste samples from one waste treatment facility (wtf) needed to be modified for satisfactory detection of pathogens in samples from other wtfs, emphasizing the need for extensive field testing of laboratory-derived pcr protocols. a survey of 13 wtfs in germany revealed that all facilities complied with the german biowaste ordinance, which mandates that the end product after anaerobic digestion or aerobic composting be free of salmonella in addition, all  biosolids were free of l. monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, and y. enterocolitica, as evidenced by both classical and pcr-based detection methods.

TI  == survivability and long-term preservation of bacteria in water and in phosphate-buffered saline.
AB  == aims: to evaluate the suitability of using sterile water and phosphate-buffered saline (pbs) for preservation of bacteria pathogenic to plants or humans. methods and results: the stationary-phase bacterial cells collected from rich agar media  were transferred to 10 ml of sterile water or pbs (ph 7.2) containing kh2po4, 15.44 microm; nacl, 1.55 mm; na2hpo4, 27.09 microm in a screw-cap tube. the tubes were sealed with parafilm membranes and stored in the dark and at room temperature. almost all the bacteria tested (148 strains), including pseudomonas  fluorescens, p. viridiflava, erwinia spp., xanthomonas campestris, cytophaga johnsonae, salmonella spp., yersinia enterocolitica, escherichia coli o157:h7, listeria monocytogenes and staphylococcus aureus, survived in water for at least  several months and up to 16 years. a vast majority of the gram-negative bacteria  tested survived equally well in water and in pbs for at least 30 weeks. however,  the populations of two gram-positive bacteria [g(+)], l. monocytogenes and staph. aureus, declined more rapidly in water than in pbs. conclusions: plant- and human-pathogenic bacteria can be preserved in pure water or pbs for several years. g(+) bacteria appear to survive better in pbs than in water. significance  and impact of the study: the method described here is a simple and economical means for preservation of bacterial cultures, which is especially useful for laboratories not equipped with the lyophilizer or ultra-low freezer. long-term survival of food-borne pathogens in water underlines the importance of water as a potential vehicle for transmitting the diseases.

TI  == serum concentration of hakata antigen, a member of the ficolins, is linked with inhibition of aerococcus viridans growth.
AB  == background: hakata antigen (hakata) is a novel serum glycoprotein that consists of collagen- and fibrinogen-like domains, similar to ficolin/p35. our research suggested that serum hakata may be a target of a polysaccharide (psa) produced by aerococcus viridans. methods: a. viridans was incubated with human plasma and hakata-depleted plasma to examine hakata binding and growth inhibition of a. viridans through binding with psa. results: when a. viridans was mixed with human acid citrate dextrose-one (acd-a) plasma, it pulled down hakata complexed with mannose-binding lectin (mbl)-associated serine proteases 1 and 2 (masp-1 and masp-2). this complex had the potential for c4 deposition. serum hakata circulates as hakata-masps complex in the blood and is proteolytically active. by mixing a. viridans with human plasma, we prepared a hakata-depleted plasma, deficient in hakata-masps complex. this plasma failed to inhibit a. viridans growth plasma, but does not inhibit staphylococcus aureus, yersinia enterocolitica and escherichia coli. however, a decrease of growth inhibition of  a. viridans in hakata-depleted plasma could be restored by adding a hakata-masps  complex preparation in a dose-dependent manner. on the other hand, the hakata-masps complex exhibited strong binding to a. viridans, but not to s. aureus, y. enterocolitica and e. coli. conclusions: the serum concentration of hakata is linked with growth inhibition of a. viridans upon binding of hakata via psa.

TI  == application of a convenient dna extraction method and multiplex pcr for the direct detection of staphylococcus aureus and yersinia enterocolitica in milk samples.
AB  == the application of pcr for the direct and sensitive detection of food-borne pathogens is largely affected by the quality of the template dna prepared from food samples. in the present study, a chemical extraction method of bacterial dna from spiked milk samples for the direct detection of staphylococcus aureus and yersinia enterocolitica was evaluated by pcr. gene specific primers were designed to target the nuclease (nuc) and the attachment invasion locus (ail) genes of s.  aureus and y. enterocolitica, respectively and used in pcr. a combination of organic solvents, detergents and alkali in the dna extraction method permitted a  detection limit of 10 cfu ml(-1) milk for both the pathogens. when equal numbers  of s. aureus and y. enterocolitica were spiked in milk samples, the individual detection limit was determined to be 10(3) cfu ml(-1) milk. simultaneous amplification of 482 and 359 bp fragments of the nuc and ail genes was obtained using the primer pairs in a single reaction. multiplex pcr enabled the detection  of 10(4) cfu ml(-1) milk of s. aureus and y. enterocolitica without any pre-enrichment step. a combination of conventional isolation technique and pcr using dna extracted by the proposed method was used to test raw milk samples for  possible contamination with s. aureus and y. enterocolitica. the presence of s. aureus in the tested samples was indicated by both the methods while y. enterocolitica could not be detected in any of the samples. the template dna extraction method developed in this study is rapid, sensitive and avoids interference from potential pcr inhibitors and demonstrates the potential of detecting multiple pathogens in milk samples without any enrichment.

TI  == bacterial inactivation by high-pressure homogenisation and high hydrostatic pressure.
AB  == the resistance of five gram-positive bacteria, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, lactobacillus plantarum, listeria innocua and leuconostoc  dextranicum, and six gram-negative bacteria, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, shigella flexneri, yersinia enterocolitica, pseudomonas fluorescens  and two strains of escherichia coli, to high-pressure homogenisation (100-300 mpa) and to high hydrostatic pressure (200-400 mpa) was compared in this study. within the group of gram-positive bacteria and within the group of gram-negative  bacteria, large differences were observed in resistance to high hydrostatic pressure, but not to high-pressure homogenisation. all gram-positive bacteria were more resistant than any of the gram-negative bacteria to high-pressure homogenisation, while in relative to high hydrostatic pressure resistance both groups overlapped. within the group of gram-negative bacteria, there also existed another order in resistance to high-pressure homogenisation than to high hydrostatic pressure. further it appears that the mutant e. coli lmm1010, which is resistant to high hydrostatic pressure is not more resistant to high-pressure  homogenisation than its parental strain mg1655. the preceding observations indicate a different response of the test bacteria to high-pressure homogenisation compared to high hydrostatic pressure treatment, which suggests that the underlying inactivation mechanisms for both techniques are different. further, no sublethal injury could be observed upon high-pressure homogenisation  of y. enterocolitica and s. aureus cell population by using low ph (5.5 7), nacl  (0 6%) or sds (0-100 mg/l) as selective components in the plating medium. finally, it was observed that successive rounds of high-pressure homogenisation have an additive effect on viability reduction of y. enterocolitica and s. aureus.

TI  == bacteriological analysis of fresh produce in norway.
AB  == a total of 890 samples of fresh produce obtained from norwegian markets were examined in order to assess the bacteriological quality of the products and their potential public health risk. the samples comprised lettuce, pre-cut salads, growing herbs, parsley and dill, mushrooms and strawberries. the samples were analysed for the presence of thermotolerant coliform bacteria (tcb), escherichia  coli o157, salmonella spp., listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus spp., and yersinia enterocolitica. neither salmonella spp. nor e. coli o157 were isolated.  for all product groups included, tcb were isolated from a small proportion of samples. three samples harboured l. monocytogenes; one of the isolates belonging  to serogroup 1 (champignons) and two of the isolates belonging to serogroup 4 (chinese leaves and strawberries). staphylococci were isolated from a relatively  large proportion of the samples of strawberries and mushrooms. however, only four isolates were identified as s. aureus (non-toxinogenic). by the use of pcr, the presence of y. enterocolitica was indicated in a few of the samples of lettuce, whilst no positive samples were found using a culturing method. the study shows that the occurrence of pathogenic bacteria and tcb in the products analysed was quite low. nevertheless, the results indicate that the type of products analysed  may contain pathogenic bacteria and thereby represent a risk to the consumers in  regard to food-borne diseases.

TI  == prevention and management of infection in children with sickle cell anaemia.
AB  == sickle cell anaemia (sca) predisposes a child to infections for various reasons,  including increased bone marrow turnover, poor perfusion and functional asplenia  leading to decreased opsonisation of polysaccharide encapsulated organisms. bacteria and viruses that most frequently cause serious infections in children with sickle cell disease are streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae type b, salmonella spp., escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, mycoplasma pneumoniae, chlamydia pneumoniae, parvovirus b19 and hepatitis a, b and c viruses. penicillin prophylaxis has decreased the incidence of infection-related  morbidity and mortality significantly in children with sca. children <3 years of  age are administered oral penicillin 125mg twice daily, and the dose is increased to 250mg twice daily for the >3 to 5 year age group. adherence to the penicillin  prophylactic regimen is recommended for children with sca who are >5 years of age. for children with sca who have recurrent invasive pneumococcal infections, an effort is made to keep the child on penicillin prophylaxis indefinitely. the administration of various childhood vaccines has also made an appreciable impact  on the overall morbidity and mortality associated with infection in children with sca. the administration of the heptavalent conjugate pneumococcal vaccine (pcv7)  has provided control of invasive pneumococcal infections, and the prophylactic use of the h. influenzae type b conjugate vaccine has reduced the incidence of septicaemia and meningitis caused by this organism. other vaccines used prophylactically in children with sca include hepatitis a and b, and vaccines against influenza and varicella viruses. the immediate administration of intravenous antibacterials, after appropriate blood and urine cultures, is of great importance in the treatment of the febrile child with sca. ceftriaxone and  cefotaxime have been recommended for the treatment of septic episodes in sca associated with s. pneumoniae, haemophilus and salmonella spp. infection with yersinia enterocolitica may be treated with cefotaxime or an aminoglycoside. the  prevalence of helicobacter pylori infection in sca is unknown. effective therapies include metronidazole, tetracycline or amoxicillin. parvovirus infections require supportive care and specific antiviral therapy is not indicated. the judicious use of antimicrobials is encouraged in view of the worldwide emergence of multidrug-resistant strains. the long term sequelae associated with infections in children with sca can be decreased with the implementation of immunisation programmes and effective and prompt treatment with appropriate antibacterials.

TI  == development of a brucella suis specific hybridisation probe and pcr which distinguishes b. suis from brucella abortus.
AB  == a genomic library was prepared from brucella suis dna (mboi digested) and cloned  into the bamhi site of puc18. colony hybridisation using a probe prepared from purified b. suis dna labelled with alpha 32p was carried out to identify colonies of interest. about 20 colonies, which gave an intense signal upon hybridisation with whole b. suis genomic dna as a probe, were selected. because of the high degree of dna homology between b. suis and brucella abortus, a short probe was chosen as it would more likely give species specificity. of seven fragments selected to probe whole b. suis, b. abortus, and yersinia enterocolitica dna, one was found to hybridise with b. suis only. the probe was sequenced in two directions and sense and anti sense primers of 25bp in length were chosen to yield a product of 421bp. after optimisation of the pcr, a product of 420bp was obtained with b. suis template dna and two bands of 420 and 650bp were detected with b. abortus template dna. this is the first reported pcr of the brucella genome where a single pair of primers will discriminate between b. suis and b. abortus. no band was observed when the two primers were used to amplify e. coli,  y. enterocolitica, enterobacter cloacae, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus uberis, corynebacterium bovis, or serratia marcescens template dna.

TI  == molecular mechanisms of bacteria induced apoptosis.
AB  == interaction of mammalian cells with pathogenic bacteria results in a whole variety of responses in the infected cells including internalization or phagocytosis of the bacterium, release of cytokines, secretion of defensins or production of oxygen radicals. however, recent studies pointed out that many bacteria are able to trigger apoptosis in the host cell. the induction of apoptosis upon infection results from a complex interaction of bacterial proteins with cellular proteins finally mediating apoptosis. thus, bacteria are able to activate several pro-apoptotic proteins, e.g. caspases, to inactivate anti-apoptotic proteins, e.g. nf(kappa)b or map-kinases, or to upregulate endogenous receptor/ligand systems, that induce apoptosis, on the surface of the  infected cell. host cell apoptosis very often serves the bacteria to attack the host and to gain access to the tissue. however, in some infections, apoptosis of  mammalian cells significantly contributes to the host defense against the bacteria further indicating the role of apoptosis in host-pathogen interactions.

TI  == conserved degp protease in gram-positive bacteria is essential for thermal and oxidative tolerance and full virulence in streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == the degp protease, a multifunctional chaperone and protease, has been shown to be essential for virulence in gram-negative pathogens such as salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, brucella abortus, yersinia enterocolitica, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the function of degp in pathogenesis appears to be the degradation of damaged proteins that accumulate as a result of the initial host response to infection, which includes the release of reactive oxygen intermediates. additionally, the degp protease plays a major role in monitoring and maintaining  the escherichia coli periplasm and influences e. coli pilus biogenesis. we report here the identification of highly homologous enzymes in streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus mutans, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococcus faecalis. moreover, the phenotype of an insertionally inactivated degp allele in s. pyogenes is similar to that reported for e. coli, with temperature sensitivity for growth and enhanced sensitivity to reactive oxygen intermediates. virulence studies in a mouse model of streptococcal infection indicate that a functional degp protease is required for full virulence. these results suggest degp as an attractive broad-spectrum target for future anti-infective drug development.

AB  == the literature on the death and survival of foodborne pathogens in commercial mayonnaise, dressing, and sauces was reviewed and statistically analyzed with emphasis on salmonella, escherichia coli o157:h7, and listeria monocytogenes. the absence of reports of foodborne illness associated directly with the consumption  of commercially prepared acidic dressings and sauces is evidence of their safety. salmonella, e. coli o157:h7, e. coli, l. monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, and yersinia enterocolitica die when inoculated into mayonnaise and dressings. historically, mayonnaise and dressings have been exempt from the acidified food regulations and have justly deserved this status due primarily to the toxic effect of acetic and to a lesser extent lactic and citric acids. these organic acids are inimical to pathogenic bacteria and are effective natural preservatives with acetic being the most effective in killing pathogenic bacteria at the ph values encountered in these products. statistical analysis on data reported in the literature shows that the most important and significant factor in destroying pathogenic bacteria is ph as adjusted with acetic acid followed by the concentration of acetic acid in the water phase. the reported highest manufacturing target ph for dressings and sauces is 4.4, which is below the 4.75  pka of acetic acid and below the reported inhibitory ph of 4.5 for foodborne pathogens in the presence of acetic acid. the overall conclusion is that these products are very safe. they should remain exempt from the acidified food regulations providing adequate research has been done to validate their safety, and the predominant acid is acetic and reasonable manufacturing precautions are taken.

AB  == cured meats such as ham can undergo premature spoilage on account of the proliferation of lactic acid bacteria. this spoilage is generally evident from a  milkiness in the purge of vacuum-packaged sliced ham. although cured, most hams are at more risk of spoilage than other types of processed meat products because  they contain considerably higher concentrations of carbohydrates, approximately 2 to 7%, usually in the form of dextrose and corn syrup solids. unfortunately, the  meat industry is restricted with respect to the choice of preservatives and bactericidal agents. an alternative approach from these chemical compounds would  be to use novel carbohydrate sources that are unrecognizable to spoilage bacteria. l-glucose and d-tagatose are two such potential sugars, and in a series of tests in vitro, the ability of bacteria to utilize each as an energy source was compared to that of d-glucose. results showed that both l-glucose and d-tagatose are not easily catabolized by a variety of lactic bacteria and not at  all by pathogenic bacteria such as escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella typhimurium, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, and yersinia enterocolitica. in a separate study, d-glucose, l-glucose, and d-tagatose were added to a chopped and formed ham formulation and the rate of bacterial growth was monitored. analysis of data by a general linear model revealed that the growth rates of total aerobic and lactic acid bacteria were significantly (p < 0.05) slower for the formulation containing d-tagatose than those containing l- or d-glucose. levels of enterobacteriaceae were initially low and these bacteria did not significantly (p < 0.20) change in the presence of any of the sugars used in the  meat formulations. compared to the control sample containing d-glucose, the shelf life of the chopped and formed ham containing d-tagatose at 10 degrees c was extended by 7 to 10 days. these results indicate that d-tagatose could deter the  growth of microorganisms and inhibit the rate of spoilage in a meat product containing carbohydrates.

TI  == microbiological quality and safety of ready-to-eat street-vended foods in johannesburg, south africa.
AB  == fifty-one ready-to-eat street foods, 18 dishwater, and 18 surface swab samples were collected from six vendors in johannesburg, south africa. food temperatures  were recorded at the time of sampling. standard methods were used to determine aerobic plate counts (apcs), spore counts (scs), and enterobacteriaceae counts (ecs) for food samples as well as coliform counts (ccs) for water and swab samples. in addition, petrifilm escherichia coli count (pc) plates were used for  the enumeration of coliforms in food, water, and swab samples. the presence of selected foodborne pathogens in the food samples as well as the presence of nonpathogenic e. coli 1 (in food and water samples) was also tested for. predominant colonies isolated from apc plates were characterized to the genus level. holding temperatures for cooked meats and gravies ranged from 42.0 to 94.0 degrees c, and those for uncooked salads ranged from 29.0 to 39.0 degrees c. mean apc values of 3.4 (+/-0.4) log cfu/g, 4.0 (+/-1.2) log cfu/ml, and 2.1 (+/-0.4) log cfu/25 cm2 were obtained for food, water, and swab samples, respectively. mean sc values of 1.6 (+/-0.2) log cfu/g and 1.5 (+/-0.3) log cfu/25 cm2 were obtained for food and swab samples, respectively. a mean ec value of 2.0 (+/-0.4) log cfu/g for food samples and mean cc values of 2.5 (+/-0.3) log cfu/ml and 1.3  (+/-0.3) log cfu/25 cm2 for water and swab samples, respectively, were determined. mean pc values of 1.6 (+/-0.1) log cfu/g, 1.9 (+/-0.6) log cfu/ml, and 1.4 (+/-0.4) log cfu/25 cm2 were determined for food, water, and swab samples, respectively. bacillus cereus was detected in 22%, clostridium perfringens in 16%, salmonella spp. in 2%, and e. coli (non-o157:h+) in 2% of the 51 food samples. e. coli was found in 14 water samples (78%) and in 3 food samples (6%). campylobacter spp., listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus,  vibrio cholerae, and yersinia enterocolitica were also tested for in the food samples, but they were not detected. the 340 isolates obtained from apc plates for food, water, and swab samples were predominantly bacillus spp., micrococcus spp., and staphylococcus spp. for all three sample types. it was concluded that the foods analyzed in this study were of acceptable quality and safety.

TI  == direct detection of bacteria in cellular blood products using bacterial ribosomal rna-directed probes coupled to electrochemiluminescence.
AB  == various techniques for detecting bacteria in blood products exist; however, none  has been widely accepted. our method permits direct bacterial detection in both platelet concentrates (pc) and packed red blood cells (rbc). this novel procedure targets bacterial ribosomal rna (rrna) but does not utilize culture or nucleic acid amplification. the assay comprises five steps: (1) release of bacterial rrna by cell lysis with a combination of detergents and high heat; (2) hybridization of bacterial rrna using a biotin- and a ruthenium (origen)-labelled oligonucleotide probe pair; (3) capture of labelled rrna with streptavidin-coated magnetic beads; (4) concentration of labelled rrna/bead complexes out of solution and onto an electrode surface with a magnet; (5) detection of ruthenium-labelled  bacterial rrna by application of voltage and consequent generation of the electrochemiluminescent (ecl) signal. results using pc and rbc samples, spiked with clinically relevant gram-negative and -positive bacterial species, consistently demonstrated a linear relationship between ecl signal (equates to rrna level) and colony forming units (cfu) ml(-1). signals were generated in the  range of 1400-80000 and 3500-500000 ecl units for unwashed and washed samples, respectively. this is equivalent to 10(5)-10(8)cfu ml(-1). these data demonstrate that therapeutic blood products significantly contaminated with bacteria may be identified prior to issue.

TI  == ubiquicidin, a novel murine microbicidal protein present in the cytosolic fraction of macrophages.
AB  == previously we have identified and characterized three murine microbicidal proteins purified from the granule fraction of cells from the murine macrophage cell line raw264.7. during these studies evidence was obtained for the presence of an additional antimicrobial protein in the cytosolic fraction of raw264.7 cells that had been activated with interferon-gamma (ifn-gamma). in this study we have purified this protein, designated ubiquicidin, to apparent homogeneity and demonstrated that it is a cationic, small (mr 6654) protein. ubiquicidin displayed marked antimicrobial activity against listeria monocytogenes and salmonella typhimurium. using a gel overlay procedure evidence was obtained that  the protein also displays activity against escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, and an avirulent strain of yersinia enterocolitica. aminoterminal amino acid sequencing and mass spectrometry analysis of purified ubiquicidin indicated  that it is most likely identical to the ribosomal protein s30. this protein is produced by posttranslational processing of the fau protein, a 133-amino-acid fusion protein consisting of s30 linked to an unusual peptide with significant homology to ubiquitin. the fau gene has been reported to be expressed in a variety of tissues in humans and various animal species. the presence of ubiquicidin in the cytosol of macrophages may serve to restrict the intracellular growth of microorganisms. in addition, because macrophage disintegration will likely lead to release of ubiquicidin into the extracellular environment, it may  contribute to host defense after macrophage death.

TI  == non-iron metalloporphyrins: potent antibacterial compounds that exploit haem/hb uptake systems of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == a new group of potent antibacterial compounds, non-iron metalloporphyrins (mps),  is described. mps possess a strong antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria, gram-negative bacteria and mycobacteria. anaerobically grown bacteria and microorganisms that do not respire and/or express haem uptake systems were resistant to mps. antibacterial activity of mps was not affected by known antibiotic resistance mechanisms operating in bacteria. the most potent mp against y. enterocolitica, methicillin-resistant s. aureus and m. smegmatis was gallium protoporphyrin ix (ga-ppix). when tested alone, ga ions and metal-free porphyrins had approximately 100-fold higher minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) values for these organisms. ga-ppix was not degraded by mp-sensitive bacteria, indicating that the whole molecule is responsible for antibacterial activity. mps are antibacterial 'trojan horses', as they exploit haem transport systems of gram-negative bacteria as portals of entry into the cell. bacterial mutants in superoxide dismutases, catalases and stationary-phase sigma factors were hypersensitive to ga-ppix. the extreme sensitivity of sod mutants to mps and the requirement for active respiration for mp activity suggests that these compounds stimulate the production of reactive oxygen radicals in bacteria. ga-ppix was not toxic to primary human fibroblasts, several established cell lines and experimental animals at concentrations > 100-fold higher than the mic for sensitive bacteria.

TI  == measurement of antibacterial activities of t-2 toxin, deoxynivalenol, ochratoxin  a, aflatoxin b1 and fumonisin b1 using microtitration tray-based turbidimetric techniques.
AB  == various mycotoxins were tested for their antibacterial activity by evaluating growth delays using a fully automated microturbidmetric method. ten different strains of the genera escherichia, streptococcus, staphylococcus, yersinia, salmonella, erysipelothrix and lactobacillus were used as test micro-organisms. t-2 toxin, deoxynivalenol (don), ochratoxin a (ota), aflatoxin b1 (afb1) and fumonisin b1 (fb1) were used as representative mycotoxins. the inhibitory effect  in vitro was defined as the difference between the growth rate without mycotoxins and the growth rate in the presence of a mycotoxin. among the tested strains, streptococcus agalactiae was found to be sensitive to all the toxins, with the exception of ota. t-2 toxin and fb1 were the most effective in slowing down the growth of staphylococcus aureus. afb1 affected the growth of yersinia enterocolitica. the growth rate of escherichia coli and salmonella infantis was decreased by fb1. among the bacterial strains used in this study, only the growth of erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae was inhibited by ota. thus, using appropriate tester strains it should be possible to set up a broad-range microtubidimetry assay for individual mycotoxin screening in vitro. we concluded that the microtitration technique provides a rapid, convenient and high-throughput capacity system to analyse bacteria-mycotoxin interactions.

TI  == effects of tamoxifen, melatonin, coenzyme q10, and l-carnitine supplementation on bacterial growth in the presence of mycotoxins.
AB  == the involvement of toxic oxygen intermediates in the bacteriostatic effects of mycotoxins (t-2 toxin, deoxynivalenol, ochratoxin a, aflatoxin b1, and fumonisin  b1) was investigated by producing bacterial growth curves using turbidimetry assays in the presence and absence of oxygen radical-scavenging substances. the strains used in this study included escherichia coli (ft 101), streptococcus agalactiae (ft 311, ft 313, ft 315), staphylococcus aureus (ft 192), yersinia enterocolitica (ft 430), salmonella infantis (ft 431), erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae (ft 432), lactobacillus plantarum (ft234) and lactobacillus casei (ft 232). tamoxifen, melatonin, l-carnitine and coenzyme q10 were used as radical scavengers against oxygen toxicity to the strains studied. tamoxifen was the most effective in inhibiting bacterial growth when used at a high concentration, whereas melatonin and l-carnitine were less effective. a combination of l-carnitine and coenzyme q10 provided better protection against oxygen toxicity caused by the mycotoxins growth than they did individually. it was concluded that oxygen radicals are involved in the killing of bacteria and that there is endogenous formation of toxic oxygen products by mycotoxins. the objective of this study was to determine whether the antioxidants were able to counteract the  toxic effects of the mycotoxins. the data obtained indicate that bacterial growth can be inhibited especially by t-2 toxin, aflatoxin b1 and ochratoxin a and that  this effect can be partially counteracted by antioxidants such as coenzyme q10 plus l-carnitine.

TI  == detection and characterization of a novel antibacterial substance produced by a lactobacillus delbrueckii strain 1043.
AB  == a novel antibacterial substance produced by a strain isolated from bulgarian yellow cheese was characterized. the producer strain was identified by molecular  typing to belong to the species lactobacillus delbrueckii, which is a rare producer of bacteriocins. the inhibitory agent was heat stable and active against lactic acid bacteria species and several food-borne pathogens: listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, yersinia enterocolitica and y. pseudotuberculosis. its sensitivity to amylolitic  enzymes and lipase suggested that a lipid and carbohydrate moiety could be important for the activity. the amino acid content of the purified bacteriocin was estimated to 29 amino acids. the bacteriocin was shown to be small (3.6-6 kda) by three different methods: hplc gel-filtration, sds-page and amino acid contents.

TI  == resistance to antimicrobial agents used for animal therapy in pathogenic-, zoonotic- and indicator bacteria isolated from different food animals in denmark: a baseline study for the danish integrated antimicrobial resistance monitoring programme (danmap).
AB  == this study describes the establishment and first results of a continuous surveillance system of antimicrobial resistance among bacteria isolated from pigs, cattle and broilers in denmark. the three categories of bacteria tested were: 1) indicator bacteria (escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium), 2) zoonotic bacteria (campylobacter coli/jejuni, salmonella enterica, yersinia enterocolitica), and 3) animal pathogens (e. coli,  staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns), staphylococcus hyicus, actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae). a total of 3304 bacterial isolates collected from october 1995 through december 1996 were tested for susceptibility  to all major classes of antimicrobial agents used for therapy in denmark. bacterial species intrinsically resistant to an antimicrobial were not tested towards that antimicrobial. acquired resistance to all antimicrobials was found.  the occurrence of resistance varied by animal origin and bacterial species. in general, resistance was observed more frequently among isolates from pigs than from cattle and broilers. the association between the occurrence of resistance and the consumption of the antimicrobial is discussed, as is the occurrence of resistance in other countries. the results of this study show the present level of resistance to antimicrobial agents among a number of bacterial species isolated from food animals in denmark. thus, the baseline for comparison with future prospective studies has been established, enabling the determination of trends over time.

AB  == this study was conducted to describe the occurrence of acquired resistance to antimicrobials used for growth promotion among bacteria isolated from swine, cattle and poultry in denmark. resistance to structurally related therapeutic agents was also examined. three categories of bacteria were tested: 1) indicator  bacteria (escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium), 2) zoonotic bacteria (campylobacter, salmonella, yersinia enterocolitica), and 3) animal pathogens (e. coli, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns), staphylococcus hyicus, actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae). all antimicrobials used as growth promoters in denmark and some structurally related  therapeutic agents (in brackets) were included: avilamycin, avoparcin (vancomycin), bacitracin, carbadox, flavomycin, monensin, olaquindox, salinomycin, spiramycin (erythromycin, lincomycin), tylosin (erythromycin, lincomycin), and virginiamycin (pristinamycin). bacterial species intrinsically resistant to an antimicrobial were not tested towards that antimicrobial. breakpoints for growth promoters were established by population distribution of the bacteria tested. a total of 2,372 bacterial isolates collected during october 1995 to september 1996 were included in the study. acquired resistance to all currently used growth promoting antimicrobials was found. a frequent occurrence of resistance were observed to avilamycin, avoparcin, bacitracin, flavomycin, spiramycin, tylosin and virginiamycin, whereas resistance to carbadox, monensin,  olaquindox and salinomycin was less frequent. the occurrence of resistance varied by animal origin and bacterial species. the highest levels of resistance was observed among enterococci, whereas less resistance was observed among zoonotic bacteria and bacteria pathogenic to animals. the association between the occurrence of resistance and the consumption of the antimicrobial is discussed. the results show the present level of resistance to growth promoters in bacteria  from food animals in denmark. they will form the baseline for comparison with future prospective studies, thereby enabling the determination of trends over time.

TI  == recovery of foodborne microorganisms from potentially lethal radiation damage.
AB  == a two-stage recovery protocol was examined for microorganisms following gamma irradiation in phosphate buffer at 0 degrees c. in the first stage, survivors were recovered on basal yeast extract agar and held at various temperatures suboptimal for their growth for 20 h (resuscitation protocol). in the second stage the survivors were incubated for an additional 24 h, but in this case at their optimum temperature for growth. controls consisted of survivors which were  not subjected to the resuscitation protocol (direct incubation at their optimum growth temperature). the ratio of survivors enumerated with and without the resuscitation protocol (control) at each specified temperature was used to formulate a recovery factor(rf). an rf was determined for each treatment dose. results of this study indicated that the number of escherichia coli, salmonella serotype typhimurium and brochothrix thermosphacta survivors increased following  a resuscitation protocol (rf > 2.0). overall, optimum resuscitation temperatures  ranged from 14 to 22 degrees c. the extent of recovery also appeared dose dependent, with larger treatment doses giving rise to a higher rf. s. serotype typhimurium irradiated at 1.5 kgy exhibited the highest rf, 161, when resuscitated at 22 degrees c. listeria monocytogenes, yersinia enterocolitica, staphylococcus aureus, aeromonas hydrophila and saccharomyces cerevisiae exhibited an rf < 2.0 regardless of resuscitation temperature. results of this study indicated that the use of suboptimal holding temperatures as part of a recovery protocol may have advantages, especially with respect to the enumeration of e. coli and salmonellae survivors in irradiated foods such as poultry.

TI  == studying the effect of temperature on microbial growth using multiplicative model.
AB  == the specific growth rates of brochothrix thermosphacta, listeria monocytogenes, yersinia enterocolitica, bacillus cereus, escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella spp., staphylococcus aureus and clostridium perfringens at various temperatures were taken from the food micromodel database, and the data sets of specific growth rate versus temperature were fitted using the multiplicative model (r = a  td, r = specific growth rate; t = temperature; a, d = regression parameters). the exponential d-value derived from microbial growth at suboptimum temperatures reflected the effectiveness of temperature in enhancing growth. a microorganism with a large d-value exhibited a large increment of growth rate as temperature increased. the d-value of a microorganism was related to the temperature range for growth. the temperature range for the growth of psychrotrophs was usually narrow for b. thermosphacta and y. enterocolitica; hence the d-values of these two psychrotrophs were close to 1 whereas d-values of mesophiles, such as b. cereus, e. coli o157:h7, salmonella spp., and s. aureus, were 2.31-2.90, and the  d-value of c. perfringens, a thermophile, was 3.29. the values of parameter a of  the model were affected by extra salt added into cultures. for all the strains mentioned above, the a-values decreased when the cultures contained higher levels of salt. the lowering of the a-value implied that the influence of temperature on the growth rate in the model was reduced. the change of the d-value was dependent on the capability of the microorganism to overcome the obstacle to growth and was affected by the composition of the nutrients and by inhibitory factors in the culture. the influence of environmental factors on the d-value was also found in  chinese sausages. the d-value of a dominant spoilage strain of enterococcus sp. derived from sausages was 0.833 whereas the d-value derived from mrs cultures was 2.36. in refrigerated foods which usually contained some preservatives and were stored at low temperature, the d-value of psychrotrophic spoilage bacteria was around 1. in this case, the linear model could be a reasonable choice for predicting the proliferation of spoilage bacteria.

AB  == an expression system for studying epitopes of adhesion proteins based on fusion of gene fragments into flic(h7) of escherichia coli is described. we constructed  the system by an in-frame insertion of dna fragments encoding one, two or three of the fibronectin-binding d repeats present in the fibronectin-binding protein a (fnbpa) of staphylococcus aureus, into the flic(h7) gene region encoding the variable domain of the h7 flagellin. the constructs were expressed by in trans complementation in the e. coli strain jt1 which harbours knock-out mutations for  the expression of flic as well as of the mannoside-binding fimbrial adhesin. the  resulting chimeric flagella, which contained 39, 77 or 115 heterologous amino acid residues, efficiently bound soluble and immobilized human plasma and cellular fibronectin, and the binding was most efficient with the flagella containing the three d repeats of fnbpa. the chimeric flagella bound to frozen sections of human kidney and to cultured human cells. antibodies raised against the chimeric flagella bound to protein a-deficient s. aureus cells and inhibited  the binding of staphylococci to immobilized fibronectin. we also expressed peptides, ranging in size between 48 and 302 amino acids, of the collagen-binding yada adhesin of yersinia enterocolitica. a fragment of 302 amino acids representing the middle region of yada was needed for collagen binding. chimeric  flagellar filaments expressing hundreds of intimately associated adhesive epitopes offer versatile tools to analyze adhesin-receptor interactions and functional epitopes of adhesion proteins.

AB  == the consequences of a change from a traditional meat inspection procedure, including manual handling, palpation and incision, to an entirely visual postmortem meat inspection procedure in danish slaughter pigs were assessed by a  comparative study of the two methods in 183,383 slaughter pigs. out of 58 lesion  codes (selected with a prevalence > or = 5.5 x 10(-5)), 26 (45 per cent) were assessed either as merely aesthetic or as the healed stage of an earlier lesion and nine (15 per cent) as active, but local processes, occurring only in non-edible tissue. five lesion codes (9 per cent) were assessed as active, non-abscessal processes occurring in edible tissue, caused by swine-specific pathogens and 10 (17 per cent) were abscessal or pyaemic lesions occurring in edible tissue. seven lesion codes (12 per cent) may be associated with consumer health hazards (two frequently and five rarely), and one with occupational health hazards. it was estimated that per 1000 carcases, an additional 2.5 with abscessal or pyaemic lesions (in edible tissue) containing staphylococcus aureus, 4 x 10(-4) containing ochratoxin, 0.2 with arthritis due to erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, 0.1 with caseous lymphadenitis, 0.7 faecally contaminated with salmonella species, and 3.4 faecally contaminated with yersinia enterocolitica would remain undetected as a result of changing from the traditional to the visual inspection procedure. two valuable reasons for implementing a visual control system are the potential for decreased cross-contamination (no handling,  cutting and incision) and reduced inspection costs. the resources released as a result may be reallocated to hygiene and surveillance programmes.

AB  == partial sequencing of a genomic library of the virulence plasmid of salmonella enteritidis has been used to localize in the restriction map of this plasmid the  genetic loci already described in other salmonella plasmids. the comparison of the vestigial tra region with the corresponding genes in the f plasmid allowed us to define the extent of the deletions that the s. enteritidis plasmid should have suffered. the putative replicons of the plasmid, repb and repc, were isolated and both proved to be functional in escherichia coli, but repc was segregationally unstable. the nucleotide sequence of repb showed the typical organization of repfiia replicons, although the similarity was lower than usual in this group of  replicons. the highest homology was found with the replicon of the virulence plasmid pyve439-80 from yersinia enterocolitica (72.5%). replicon repc also showed a maximum identity of 72.6% with known replicons, namely the repfib of pcolv-k30 and p307, both virulence plasmids isolated from e. coli. we conclude that the s. enteritidis plasmid could arise from the s. typhimurium plasmid through deletions, and that they are evolutionary distant from other incfi and incfii plasmids.

TI  == safe poultry meat production in the next century.
AB  == the revolutionary industrialisation of the poultry industry in the last 30 years  has made the food poultry meat available for large groups of consumers. due to its nutritional, sensory and economical characteristics, poultry meat is by far the most popular animal food product world-wide. epidemiological reports, however, incriminate poultry meat as a source for outbreaks of human food poisoning. the organisms involved are salmonella spp., campylobacter spp. and, to a lesser extent, listeria monocytogenes, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, yersinia enterocolitica, clostridium perfringens and aeromonas spp. contamination of the end-product with pathogenic microorganisms is a reflection of the contamination of the live birds and, therefore, measures to be taken by industry  to avoid contamination of the consumer-ready product should start at that level.  in terms of the critical control point approach of the haccp concept, the quantitative contribution of critical phases in the production chain towards end-product contamination should be estimated in order to take the necessary intervention or corrective steps. to guarantee the production of safe poultry meat, knowledge of the capability of microorganisms to colonise the gastrointestinal tract is needed and the use of vaccines, antimicrobials and competitive exclusion microfloras as well as the implementation of new processing technology should be encouraged.

TI  == nahua indian medicinal plants (mexico): inhibitory activity on nf-kappab as an anti-inflammatory model and antibacterial effects.
AB  == selected plants documented as medicinal in an ethnobotanical study with the nahua of the sierra de zongolica (veracruz, mexico) were evaluated for anti-inflammatory and antibacterial activity. one of the potential sides of action of anti-inflammatory drugs is the transcription factor nf-kappab. this factor is essential for the immune, inflammatory, and acute phase responses. we therefore tested extracts from a total of 28 plants used by the nahua indians for their potential effect on the activation of the transcription factor nf-kappab. the leaves of tithonia diversifolia (hemsl.) a. gray (asteraceae) was the only extract which showed inhibitory activity. nonspecific dna binding activities were not noticably influenced. phytochemical studies to isolate the active principle and further biochemical studies in order to better understand the mode of action  of this nf-kappab inhibitor have been initiated. five plants showed noteworthy antibacterial activity against some pathogenic (staphylococcus aureus atcc 25933  and yersinia enterocolitica 03) and nonpathogenic (e. coli dsm 1077, micrococcus  luteus dsm 348) microorganism: acacia cornigera, cuscuta tinctoria, ludwigia octovalvis, lysiloma divaricata, and tithonia diversifolia.

TI  == hazard identification in swine slaughter with respect to foodborne bacteria.
AB  == swine slaughter is an open process with many opportunities for the contamination  of the pork carcass with potentially pathogenic bacteria; however, it does not contain any point where hazards are completely eliminated. data on the prevalence of various pathogenic bacteria (aeromonas hydrophila, campylobacter coli/jejuni,  listeria monocytogenes, salmonella spp., staphylococcus aureus and yersinia enterocolitica) in pigs, their growth and survival characteristics and ability to become established on the slaughter line are presented. the presentation covers the processing steps from lairage to chilling and is based on swine slaughter practices in denmark, norway and sweden. the major contamination points during swine slaughter are pig-related, such as faecal and pharyngeal, and environmental. haccp (hazard analysis critical control point) and gmp (good manufacturing practice) in swine slaughter must be focused on limiting this spread. the pathogenic bacteria show differences in their general mechanism of distribution. the major contamination source of campylobacter spp., salmonella spp. and y. enterocolitica is the pig, and the contamination of carcasses with these bacteria may be limited, provided that only strict slaughtering procedures  are used. other organisms such as aeromonas spp., l. moncytogenes/listeria spp. and s. aureus can be endemic in the processing environment. since endemic bacteria can be controlled by proper cleaning and disinfection, these organisms are useful as indicators for the success of gmp rules. the following affiliation  to cps or ccps made for specific steps during slaughter and dressing may serve as a guidance: (i) lairage (cp), (ii) killing (cp), (iii) scalding (cp), (iv) dehairing (cp), (v) singeing/flaming (cp), (vi) polishing (cp), (vii) circumanal  incision and removal of the intestines (ccp), (viii) excision of the tongue, pharynx, and in particular the tonsils (ccp), (ix) splitting (cp), (x) post mortem inspection procedures (ccp) and (xi) deboning of the head (ccp).

TI  == probes and polymerase chain reaction for detection of food-borne bacterial pathogens.
AB  == dna-hybridization and the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) are techniques commonly used to detect pathogenic bacteria. in this paper, the use of these techniques for detection of salmonella, e. coli, v. cholerae, non-o1 vibrio, yersinia enterocolitica, campylobacter, listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens, and c. botulinum is reviewed with emphasis on application in food microbiology. in food control, dna-techniques have most often been used in a 'culture confirmation' fashion, i.e. bacteria are  enriched and sometimes even purified by traditional culture procedures and thereafter identified by the use of dna-based methods. the most desirable approach is, however, to detect organisms directly in the food, but major problems remain to be solved before this can be routinely performed.

TI  == [water disinfection: comparative activities of ozone and chlorine on a wide spectrum of bacteria].
AB  == ozone and chlorine are agents that disinfect by destroying, neutralizing or inhibiting the growth of pathogenic microorganisms. the treatment of drinking water with ozone has shown to be more efficient against spores of bacillus subtilis. it was observed that the ozone already in dose of 0.35 mg/l produced the reduction of at least 5 log in populations of approximately 1 x 10(6) cells/ml of escherichia coli, vibrio cholerae, salmonella typhi, yersinia enterocolitica, pseudomonas aeruginosa, aeromonas hydrophila, listeria monocytogenes and staphylococcus aureus. with a dose of 0.50 mg/l of chlorine, the reduction was much smaller for the tested microorganisms (except vibrio cholerae), while the effect of 2 mg/l of chlorine was similar to the ozone treatment. for spores of bacillus subtilis, the reduction observed with ozone concentrations of 0.35 and 0.70 mg/l was of almost 3 log, while no considerable effect was obtained with chlorine in the tested conditions. our results have shown that both disinfectans were consumed during the treatment period, probably  because of the own water demand and the added bacterial mass.

TI  == a novel locus of yersinia enterocolitica serotype o:3 involved in lipopolysaccharide outer core biosynthesis.
AB  == yersinia enterocolitica serotype o:3 strain 6471/76-c (yeo3-c) was sensitive to bacteriophage phi r1-37 when grown at 37 degrees c but not when grown at 22 degrees c because of steric hindrance by abundant lipopolysaccharide (lps) o-side chain (o-antigen) expressed at 22 degrees c. the transposon library of yeo3-c was grown at 37 degrees c and screened for phage phi r1-37-resistant transposon insertion mutants. three types of mutant were isolated: (i) phage receptor mutants expressing o-antigen (lps-smooth), (ii) phage receptor mutants not expressing o-antigen (lps-rough), and (iii) lps-smooth mutants with the phage receptor constitutively sterically blocked. mutant type (i) was characterized in  detail; the transposon insertion inactivates an operon, named the trs operon. the main findings based on this mutant are: (i) the frs operon is involved in the biosynthesis of the lps outer core in yeo3-c; the nucleotide sequence of the trs  operon revealed eight novel genes showing similarly to known polysaccharide biosynthetic genes of various gram-negative bacteria as well as to capsule biosynthesis genes of staphylococcus aureus; (ii) the biosynthesis of the core of yeo3-c involves at least two genetic loci; (iii) the trs operon is required for the biosynthesis of the bacteriophage phi r1-37 receptor structures; (iv) the homopolymeric o-antigen of yeo3-c is ligated to the inner core in y. enterocolitica o:3; (v) the trs operon is located between the adk-hemh and gale-gsk gene pairs in the y. enterocolitica chromosome; and (vi) the phage phi r1-37 receptor is present in many but not in all y. enterocolitica serotypes. the results also allow us to speculate that the trs operon is a relic of the ancestral rfb region of y. enterocolitica o:3 carrying genes indispensable for the completion of the core polysaccharide biosynthesis.

TI  == role of yops in inhibition of phagocytosis and killing of opsonized yersinia enterocolitica by human granulocytes.
AB  == the virulence plasmid of yersinia enterocolitica codes for the production of the  outer membrane protein yada and the secretion of several proteins, called yops, which may play a role in the interaction between granulocytes and this bacterium. we investigated whether the expression of yada or the secretion of yops affected  the phagocytosis and killing of opsonized y. enterocolitica by human granulocytes. the rates of phagocytosis and killing of y. enterocolitica by granulocytes in suspension in the presence of rabbit yersinia antibodies and complement were determined by microbiological assays. in addition, noningested cell-adherent bacteria were differentiated from ingested yersiniae by immunofluorescence microscopy. plasmid-bearing opsonized y. enterocolitica was able to inhibit phagocytosis and killing by human granulocytes. the inhibition of phagocytosis was specific for the plasmid-bearing strain of y. enterocolitica, since granulocytes were still able to phagocytose and kill staphylococcus aureus  in the presence of y. enterocolitica. plasmid-cured y. enterocolitica was readily phagocytosed and killed by these cells. to investigate the role of yada or yops in the inhibition of phagocytosis by granulocytes, the phagocytosis of mutant strains unable to express yada or to secrete yops was studied. a y. enterocolitica mutant unable to secrete yops lost its ability to inhibit phagocytosis; a mutant expressing only yada was readily ingested by granulocytes. these results indicate that after attachment of opsonized y. enterocolitica to granulocytes, yops play an important role in inhibiting the ingestion of y. enterocolitica by human granulocytes.

TI  == cytokine generation in stored, white cell-reduced, and bacterially contaminated units of red cells.
AB  == background: proinflammatory cytokines were measured in the supernatant portion of stored, bacterially contaminated, and/or white cell (wbc)-reduced units of red cells (rbcs). previous studies from this laboratory and others have shown that cytokines are generated in platelet concentrates during storage. this earlier work has been expanded to the study of stored rbcs. study design and methods: units of as-1 rbcs (n = 10 non-wbc-reduced; n = 10 wbc-reduced) were obtained from a regional blood center, and each was split on day 3 of storage into three equal portions by sterile techniques. one portion was kept sterile (control), and the other two were inoculated with yersinia enterocolitica and staphylococcus aureus, respectively, at 1 to 3 colony-forming units per ml. the rbcs were stored at 1 to 6 degrees c for 42 days. sequential samples were taken during storage and assayed for interleukin 8 (il-8), interleukin 1 beta (il-1 beta), interleukin 6,  wbc count, and bacteria count. for the wbc-reduced group (n = 10), wbc removal was done by filtration on day 3 of storage, before bacterial inoculation. results: il-8 was detected in the supernatant portion of all 42-day-old, non-wbc-reduced (mean wbcs = 4760 +/- 3870/microl) units of as-1 rbcs at levels ranging from 63 to 1610 pg per ml. by contrast, at 2 to 3 days of storage, lower  levels of il-8 (range, 0-280 pg/ml) were detected in the same units. il-8 levels  increased progressively during storage in most (7/10) units. the highest mean levels of il-8 were reached by outdate at day 42. y. enterocolitica-contaminated  units had statistically higher levels of il-8, with a range of 170 to 2100 pg per ml, by 42 days of storage. s. aureus grew poorly in stored units of rbcs and failed to further stimulate cytokine production. no wbc-reduced unit (mean wbcs = 0.5 +/- 0.6/microl), even when contaminated with bacteria, had more than 260 pg per ml of il-8. although il-1 beta was not detected in any unit of rbcs at 3 days of storage, it increased to low levels (5-13 pg/ml) in all units tested at 42 days. interleukin 6 was not detected in any unit at any storage time. conclusion: il-8 and il-1 beta accumulated in the supernatants of stored rbcs despite cold storage conditions. il-8 reached levels > 1000 pg per ml in the supernatants of some rbc units. il-1 beta increased to significant but low levels (< 13 pg/ml). wbc filtration early in storage prevented the accumulation of il-8. the physiologic significance to transfusion recipients of il-8 in rbc supernatants is currently unknown and deserves further investigation.

TI  == seroreactivity to bacterial antigens is not a unique phenomenon in patients with  autoimmune thyroid diseases in canada.
AB  == it has been suggested elsewhere that the enteric pathogen yersinia enterocolitica (y.e.) might be implicated etiologically in autoimmune thyroid disease (aitd). to reevaluate this hypothesis in the canadian population, where the prevalence of anti-y.e. antibodies in the general population is very low (< 1%), we have studied the occurrence of antibacterial reactivity (against y.e. 0:3 and 0:9, escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus) in the sera of patients with hashimoto's thyroiditis (ht), graves' disease (gd), nontoxic nodular goiter (ntg), and autoimmune rheumatic diseases (ard) as well as normal controls (c). using the tube agglutination method, no single positive sample was detected in these subjects. no differences in the mean levels of anti-y.e. 0:3 or 0:9 by elisa were observed between various groups of patients. immunoreactivity in the course of medical therapy during 5-12 months did not show significant changes in  any of 12 ard and aitd patients. some serological reactivity to the plasmid containing strain of y.e. 0:3 was demonstrated in all subjects by the western blotting technique. however, weaker signals and fewer bands were noticed in these sera compared to sera from patients with acute yersiniosis. analysis of the pattern of reactivity did not show any difference in reactivity to any protein between the groups of subjects. the immunodominant antigen in y.e. 0:3 to which igg reacted in almost all subjects was the plasmid encoded 240-kda protein. our study favors the view that there is a merely coincidental incidence of seroreactivity to bacterial antigens, which appears to be irrespective of diagnosis.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of biapenem, a new carbapenem antibiotic.
AB  == biapenem is a new carbapenem antibiotic with high stability to human renal dehydropeptidase i. its in vitro activity was compared with that of imipenem, meropenem, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, piperacillin and gentamicin against a total  of 650 recent clinical isolates. mics were determined by a standard agar dilution procedure and all isolates were tested at two inocula (10(4) and 10(6) cfu). biapenem inhibited 90% of isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., proteus  mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia stuartii, enterobacter spp., citrobacter freundii, serratia marcescens, salmonella typhi, shigella sonnei and yersinia enterocolitica at < or = 2 mg/l and was as active as or two- to four-fold more active than imipenem against all these species, with the exception of serratia marcescens, against which imipenem was two-fold more active. biapenem was two-fold more active than imipenem against pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic90 4 mg/l) and had activity similar to that of imipenem against the bacteroides fragilis group (mic90 0.5 mg/l) but was two-fold less active than imipenem against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mic90 0.06 mg/l)  and was, like imipenem, inactive against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.

TI  == comparative antimicrobial activity of lomefloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and enoxacin against > 500 bacterial isolates.
AB  == an agar dilution technique was used to compare the antimicrobial activities of lomefloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and enoxacin against 544 strains of bacterial isolates. among the five quinolone agents tested, ciprofloxacin was the most active. enoxacin was the most active after ciprofloxacin against escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, proteus mirabilis, shigella spp., yersinia enterocolitica, and haemophilus influenzae with an mic90 of < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml. ofloxacin was the most active agent after ciprofloxacin against klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter diversus, and legionella pneumophila with an mic of < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml. ciprofloxacin inhibited staphylococcus spp. and streptococcus spp., at < or = 0.5 micrograms/ml and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. norfloxacin  and enoxacin had the same antimicrobial activity (mic90) against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae and some other gram-positive species, but these activities were weak when compared with ciprofloxacin. the results of this in vitro study show that ciprofloxacin is very active against gram-negative and gram-positive species.

TI  == immunological methods for the detection of structural components and metabolites  of bacteria and fungi in blood.
AB  == this review compares the clinical usefulness of immunological methods for the detection of structural components and metabolites of bacteria and fungi. bacterial antigens (especially those of mycobacterium, neisseria, staphylococcus  aureus, yersinia enterocolitica, escherichia coli, salmonella, chlamydia, and brucella) are best detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. methods involving antibodies are more expensive and are effective only when performed in  series. the detection of antibodies that recognize s aureus teichoic acid merely  confirms the presence of a metastatic complication. tissue invasion by candida albicans is not yet reliably detectable by the presence of a specific antigen. simple, but not completely reliable methods are available such as the latex test  for mannans detection and/or agglutination with liposomes for detecting 48-kda cytoplasmic protein antigen and an assay for detecting enolase antigen. a latex agglutination test has also been developed for the mannans antigen of aspergillus and for cryptococcus neoformans capsular polysaccharide; the latter test is more  cost effective. the sensitivity of both tests is improved by serial assays. a negative finding with hemagglutination-based antibody tests rules out c albicans  infection, and titers of 1/640 or higher have been associated with disseminated infection by aspergillus. concentrations of c albicans blastopore antigen antibodies higher than 400 iu/ml can be seen in disseminated candidiasis. high concentrations of endotoxin are indicative of imminent septic shock. some biological indicators (c reactive protein, angiotensin converting enzyme, fibronectin, elastase-alpha 1-antitrypsin complex, tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-6) have been used to rule out a bacterial cause of fever.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == antibacterial spectrum of lactoferricin b, a potent bactericidal peptide derived  from the n-terminal region of bovine lactoferrin.
AB  == a physiologically diverse range of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria was found to be susceptible to inhibition and inactivation by lactoferricin b, a peptide produced by gastric pepsin digestion of bovine lactoferrin. the list of susceptible organisms includes escherichia coli, salmonella enteritidis, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, yersinia enterocolitica, pseudomonas aeruginosa, campylobacter jejuni, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus mutans, corynebacterium diphtheriae, listeria monocytogenes and clostridium perfringens.  concentrations of lactoferricin b required to cause complete inhibition of growth varied within the range of 0.3 to 150 micrograms/ml, depending on the strain and  the culture medium used. the peptide showed activity against e. coli o111 over the range of ph 5.5 to 7.5 and was most effective under slightly alkaline conditions. its antibacterial effectiveness was reduced in the presence of na+, k+, mg2+ or ca2+ ions, or in the presence of various buffer salts. lactoferricin  b was lethal, causing a rapid loss of colony-forming capability in most of the species tested. pseudomonas fluorescens, enterococcus faecalis and bifidobacterium bifidum strains were highly resistant to this peptide.

TI  == incidence of pathogenic bacteria in raw milk in ireland.
AB  == raw milk from 70 farms was sampled over 13 months for salmonellas, listerias, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus and mastitic streptococci; total bacterial counts (tbc), coliforms and somatic cells were also counted. tbc < or = 30,000/ml were obtained in 63% of samples. high count milks were found mainly during the winter months: 13% of samples had > 10(4) mastitis pathogens/ml of milk. the mean somatic cell count varied from 4.0 x 10(5) to 8.0 x 10(5)/ml throughout the year with highest counts during the late lactation period. coliforms were present in all samples, but 65-71% of samples had < 100 coliforms/ml. up to 60% of supplies had < or = 10 e. coli/ml. one of the 589 samples tested (0.1%) was positive for salmonellas. yersinia enterocolitica and y. enterocolitica-like organisms were isolated from 39% of samples with up to 68% of samples positive at some sampling periods. a total of 222 strains of yersinias were isolated; y. enterocolitica (59%) was the most common strain followed by y.  fredriksenii (35%), y. kristensenii (1.0%), y. intermedia (4.5%) and y. aldovae (0.5%). listerias were isolated from 8.3% of samples tested; 4.9% were listeria monocytogenes and 3.4% were l. innocua. there was a significant rise in the isolation rate between december and april from a base line of 0-5% during the spring and summer to 35-37% during the winter months while the cows were indoors. of 66 silage samples tested from the farms involved in the survey 9% of samples were positive for listerias; 3% of these were l. monocytogenes and 6% were l. innocua.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == effects of high hydrostatic pressure on characteristics of pork slurries and inactivation of microorganisms associated with meat and meat products.
AB  == pork slurries inoculated with various test microorganisms were prepared and subjected to high hydrostatic pressure at 1000 to 6000 atm for 10 min at 25 degrees c to examine for the pressure effects on characteristics of the slurries  and the inactivation of the microorganisms associated with meat and meat products. pressure treatment at higher than 3000 atm caused coagulation and discoloration of the pork slurries. harder and more white coagulants were obtained by increasing the pressure. pressure treatment at 3000 to 6000 atm killed all the microorganisms tested by more than 6-log colony-forming units (cfu)/g except bacillus cereus spores. gram-negative microorganisms were more labile to pressure than gram-positive ones. campylobacter jejuni, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhimurium and yersinia enterocolitica were inactivated at pressures higher than 3000 atm; escherichia coli, saccharomyces cerevisiae and candida utilis at pressures higher than 4000 atm; micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus faecalis at 6000 atm. only less than one-log cfu/g of b. cereus spores were inactivated at 6000 atm. ultraviolet absorption spectra and acridine orange staining suggested that e. coli became permeable and leaked cytoplasmic rna at lower pressure than s. aureus. from the present findings, the authors propose high hydrostatic pressure treatment as a promising means of preparing wholesome meat and meat products.

AB  == experiments were performed to determine the effect of room-temperature (rt) exposure on the growth rates of selected bacteria by deliberate contamination of  as-1 packed red cell (rbc) units contained in pl146 plastic bags. isolates of staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, streptococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter agglomerans, and yersinia enterocolitica were inoculated into 3- to 5-day-old packed rbc units. the units were refrigerated at 4 to 6 degrees c for 14 days. on two occasions during this period, one-half of the units were removed from the refrigerator and held at 25 to 26 degrees c for 2 hours. timed samples taken during the periods at rt revealed stable or decreasing bacterial counts in the majority of exposed units,  and in no instance was a marked increase in bacterial growth observed. samples taken after subsequent prolonged rerefrigeration showed no significant increase in bacterial counts as compared with those in control units that were refrigerated constantly. these results indicate that rt exposure of contaminated  rbc units does not result in accelerated bacterial proliferation over a period of 2 hours and that it may, in fact, have a detrimental effect on bacterial growth.

AB  == to evaluate associative growth of psychorotrophic p. aeruginosa and s. aureus with y. enterocolitica 0:3, microorganisms were grown in trypticase soy broth in  a diffusion apparatus (ecologen) and incubated for 9 days at 4 degrees c. the effects of culture interactions were determined by growth curves, lag times, generation times, ph changes and acid production. the observed growth curves for  y. enterocolitica 0:3, p. aeruginosa and s. aureus, shows the stimulating effects of y. enterocolitica 0:3 on growth of psychotrophic microorganisms in associative culture at 4 degrees c, although it was later inhibited by these organisms as they reached the stationary phase, thus proving itself to be a poor competitor with common spoilage microorganism.

TI  == the growth of potential food poisoning organisms on chicken and pork muscle surfaces.
AB  == muscle surfaces of pork were inoculated with a mixture of yersinia enterocolitica and staphylococcus aureus, and chicken muscle with campylobacter jejuni or a mixture of salmonella typhimurium and staph. aureus. the surface growth at 20 degrees c was followed microscopically. organisms grew as discrete colonies bound together by a glycocalyx which differed between bacterial species. on prolonged incubation colonies spread peripherally and tended to coalesce, while still retaining their colony structure. staphylococcus aureus colonies were very small  and remained so. the glycocalyx was considered critical in maintaining the dense  populations of bacteria on the meat surfaces.

AB  == mononuclear cells (mnc) were stimulated with different heat-treated gram-positive and -negative bacteria, and the lymphocyte subpopulation interaction, the proliferative response, and the immunoglobulin secretion were analyzed. it can be demonstrated that beta haemolytic streptococci and staphylococcus aureus have a similar stimulation pattern: early stimulation of helper t cells, cell contacts of helper t cells and b cells, maximum proliferation on day 5 and 7, and ig secretion peak on day 7. klebsiella pneumoniae and yersinia enterocolitica do not cause proliferation, while ig secretion is seen on day 5. no cell contacts and no t cell stimulation are seen in the klebsiella culture, whilst yersinia causes slight helper t cell activation. in contrast, pha induces strong t cell stimulation, proliferation and expansion of the suppressor t cell subpopulation.  leu 7-positive lymphocytes are not activated by any of these stimulants.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of lysozyme against bacteria involved in food spoilage and food-borne disease.
AB  == egg white lysozyme was demonstrated to have antibacterial activity against organisms of concern in food safety, including listeria monocytogenes and certain strains of clostridium botulinum. we also found that the food spoilage thermophile clostridium thermosaccharolyticum was highly susceptible to lysozyme  and confirmed that the spoilage organisms bacillus stearothermophilus and clostridium tyrobutyricum were also extremely sensitive. several gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens isolated from food poisoning outbreaks, including bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens, staphylococcus aureus, campylobacter jejuni, escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella typhimurium, and yersinia enterocolitica, were all resistant. the results of this study suggest that lysozyme may have selected applications in food preservation, especially when thermophilic sporeformers are problems, and as a safeguard against food poisoning caused by c. botulinum and l. monocytogenes.

TI  == antibacterial activity of ticarcillin in the presence of clavulanate potassium.
AB  == the antibacterial effects produced by ticarcillin disodium plus clavulanate potassium, a combination of the broad-spectrum penicillin ticarcillin, and the beta-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid as the potassium salt, have been measured in vitro and in experimental infection studies. the presence of clavulanic acid resulted in a significant enhancement of the activity of ticarcillin against a wide range of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria. these included ticarcillin-resistant strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, p. vulgaris, yersinia enterocolitica, and the anaerobe bacteroides fragilis. in addition, beta-lactamase-producing isolates of  hemophilus influenzae, branhamella catarrhalis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and staphylococcus aureus were susceptible to ticarcillin and clavulanate. clavulanic acid did not influence the activity of ticarcillin against ticarcillin-susceptible bacteria. the bactericidal effects of the antibiotic combination were measured in an in vitro kinetic model in which the drug concentrations were varied to simulate those measured in humans after intravenous dosing with ticarcillin (3.0 g) and clavulanate potassium (100 mg clavulanic acid). in these tests, ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid had pronounced bactericidal activity against ticarcillin-resistant bacteria. the protection of ticarcillin by clavulanic acid from inactivation by bacterial beta-lactamases in  vivo was demonstrated in experimental infection models in which the efficacy of the ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid combination against infections caused by beta-lactamase-producing bacteria was correlated with the presence of effective concentrations of both antibiotic and inhibitor at the site of infection.

TI  == triggering infections in reactive arthritis.
AB  == certain microbes like yersinia, salmonella, shigella, campylobacter, chlamydia, and possibly gonococcus can trigger reactive arthritis especially in patients of  the hla-b27 type. in the present study we have used serological and culture methods to identify the probable triggering infection in 50 consecutive hla-b27 positive patients diagnosed as having reactive arthritis. the two most common triggering agents thus identified were yersinia enterocolitica (12 patients) and  chlamydia trachomatis (11 patients). in addition six patients had high antistreptolysin o titres and two high teichoic acid antibody titres suggesting group a streptococci and staphylococcus aureus as triggering agents. in 13 patients no preceding infection could be identified. the identity of the infective agent seems to have very little effect on the clinical picture of the reactive arthritis - the only difference between the various aetiological groups  in the present material was absence of fever in the patients with a preceding c.  trachomatis infection, of whom only one out of 11 had a temperature greater than  or equal to 38 degrees c, whereas 13 of 16 patients with a preceding enterobacterial, and five of the eight patients with a streptococcal or staphylococcal infection had raised temperatures.

TI  == comparative study of the nature and biological activities of bacterial enterotoxins.
AB  == it is apparent that there are considerable similarities between many of the enterotoxins produced by enteric pathogens. although the effect of most of these  toxins is restricted to the intestine in vivo, many cells are also sensitive to intoxication in vitro. the resultant in-vitro biochemical changes may have no pathological significance but serve to underline the central role of cyclic nucleotides in cellular fluid regulation. the biological activity of these enterotoxins is the result of interaction with membrane-bound adenylate cyclase,  leading to persistent elevation of intracellular levels of camp. stimulation of adenylate cyclase occurs consistently after a characteristic lag phase which varies somewhat between toxins. the duration and degree of stimulation of adenylate cyclase by the various toxins may point to possible differences in affinity, dissociation and mechanism of activation of the cyclase molecule. subtle events at, or within, the cell membrane must occur during intoxication and may include complex associations of toxin with membrane lipid and protein components. the heat-labile toxins of v. cholerae, e. coli, salmonella spp., a. hydrophila and y. enterocolitica have much in common in their structures, membrane receptors and biochemical modes of action. similarly the heat-stable toxins of e. coli and y. enterocolitica, match each other in their biological activities. classified along with the enterotoxin of c. perfringens, the enterotoxin produced by sh. dysenteriae (and possibly some strains of e. coli) appears to differ from the other enterotoxins by acting on protein biosynthesis primarily and not on the nucleotide cyclase activation systems. in another category must be placed the various enterotoxins produced by staph. aureus until  more is known. surprisingly little research has been directed towards the elucidation of their mode of action, although much is known of their serological  and structural differences. evidence to date suggests that staphylococcal enterotoxins differ from the other diarrhoeagenic agents discussed in this review. the structural and immunological similarities between the various heat-labile enterotoxins suggest a common genetic origin with gene transfer between the different bacterial species being responsible for the spread of enterotoxigenicity. it is possible that many of the "newer" enterotoxins owe their origin to genetic recombination with the "older" enteropathogens like v. cholerae.
