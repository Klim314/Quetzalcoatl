TI  == antimicrobial activity of apitoxin, melittin and phospholipase a(2) of honey bee  (apis mellifera) venom against oral pathogens.
AB  == in this work, we used the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) technique to evaluate the antibacterial potential of the apitoxin produced by apis mellifera bees against the causative agents of tooth decay. apitoxin was assayed in natura  and in the commercially available form. the antibacterial actions of the main components of this apitoxin, phospholipase a2, and melittin were also assessed, alone and in combination. the following bacteria were tested: streptococcus salivarius, s. sobrinus, s. mutans, s. mitis, s. sanguinis, lactobacillus casei,  and enterococcus faecalis. the mic results obtained for the commercially available apitoxin and for the apitoxin in natura were close and lay between 20 and 40 microg / ml, which indicated good antibacterial activity. melittin was the most active component in apitoxin; it displayed very promising mic values, from 4 to 40 microg / ml. phospholipase a2 presented mic values higher than 400 microg / ml. association of mellitin with phospholipase a2 yielded mic values ranging between 6 and 80 microg / ml. considering that tooth decay affects people's health, apitoxin and its component melittin have potential application against oral pathogens.

TI  == using color histograms and spa-lda to classify bacteria.
AB  == in this work, a new approach is proposed to verify the differentiating characteristics of five bacteria (escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus oralis, and staphylococcus aureus) by using digital images obtained with a simple webcam and variable selection by the  successive projections algorithm associated with linear discriminant analysis (spa-lda). in this sense, color histograms in the red-green-blue (rgb), hue-saturation-value (hsv), and grayscale channels and their combinations were used as input data, and statistically evaluated by using different multivariate classifiers (soft independent modeling by class analogy (simca), principal component analysis-linear discriminant analysis (pca-lda), partial least squares  discriminant analysis (pls-da) and successive projections algorithm-linear discriminant analysis (spa-lda)). the bacteria strains were cultivated in a nutritive blood agar base layer for 24 h by following the brazilian pharmacopoeia, maintaining the status of cell growth and the nature of nutrient solutions under the same conditions. the best result in classification was obtained by using rgb and spa-lda, which reached 94 and 100 % of classification accuracy in the training and test sets, respectively. this result is extremely positive from the viewpoint of routine clinical analyses, because it avoids bacterial identification based on phenotypic identification of the causative organism using gram staining, culture, and biochemical proofs. therefore, the proposed method presents inherent advantages, promoting a simpler, faster, and low-cost alternative for bacterial identification.

TI  == photodynamic therapy versus ultrasonic irrigation: interaction with endodontic microbial biofilm, an ex vivo study.
AB  == introduction: photodynamic therapy was introduced as an adjuvant to conventional  chemo-mechanical debridement during endodontic treatment to overcome the persistence of biofilms. the aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of photodynamic therapy (pdt) to disrupt an experimental microbial biofilm inside the root canal in a clinically applicable working time. materials and methods: thirty extracted teeth were prepared and then divided in three groups. all samples were infected with an artificially formed biofilm made of enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus salivarius, porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia bacteria. first group was treated with aseptim plus(r) photo-activated (led) disinfection system, second group by a 650 nm diode laser and toluidine blue as photosensitizer, and the third group, as control group, by ultrasonic irrigation (pui) using edta 17% and naocl 2.6% solutions. the working time for all three groups was fixed at 3 min. presence or absence of biofilm was assessed  by aerobic and anaerobic cultures. results: there was no statistically significant difference between results obtained from groups treated by aseptim plus(r) and diode laser (p<0.6267). in cultures of both groups there was a maximal bacterial growth. the group that was treated by ultrasonic irrigation and naocl and edta solutions had the best results (p<0.0001): there was a statistically significant reduction of bacterial load and destruction of microbial biofilm. conclusion: under the condition of this study, photodynamic therapy could not disrupt endodontic artificial microbial biofilm and could not inhibit bacterial growth in a clinically favorable working time.

TI  == effect of bacterial cell-free supernatants on infectivity of norovirus surrogates.
AB  == bacterial metabolic products were evaluated for inhibitory effects on viral propagation in cell culture. cell-free supernatants (cfs) were prepared from growth of enterococcus faecalis atcc 19433, pseudomonas fluorescens atcc 13525, escherichia coli 08, staphylococcus epidermidis atcc 12228, bacillus subtilis 168, bacillus coagulans 185a, b. coagulans 7050, clostridium sporogenes pa3679, and a commercial probiotic mixture of lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus rhamnosus, bifidobacterium bifidum, lactobacillus salivarius, and streptococcus thermophilus in microbiological medium or milk. the inhibitory effects of cfs on  the propagation of murine norovirus 1 and tulane virus in raw 264.7 and llcmk2 cells, respectively, were evaluated in the continuous presence of cfs or after exposure of host cells to cfs. slight inhibition of viral propagation was observed for murine norovirus and tulane virus in the continuous presence of cfs  of b. subtilis 168 and e. faecalis 19433, respectively. cfs cytotoxicity was also determined by microscopic examination. virus persisted in the cfs that demonstrated cytotoxic effects, suggesting a lack of direct effect of cfs on virions. the viral propagation indicates a general lack of competitive inhibition by bacterial extracellular products and bears significance in understanding the persistence of virus in food and human systems shared by bacteria that are recognized for their colonization and competitive capabilities.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of the risk of inducing bacterial resistance to disinfection  treatment with photolysis of hydrogen peroxide.
AB  == the purpose of the present study was to evaluate the risk of inducing bacterial resistance to disinfection treatment with photolysis of h2o2 and comparing this with existing antibacterial agents. we tested seven antibacterial agents, including amoxicillin, cefepime hydrochloride, erythromycin, ofloxacin, clindamycin hydrochloride, ciprofloxacin hydrochloride, and minocycline hydrochloride, as positive controls for validation of the assay protocol. for all of the agents tested, at least one of the four bacterial species (staphylococcus  aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, and streptococcus salivarius) was resistant to these agents by repeated exposure to subinhibitory concentrations of the agents up to 10 times. in contrast, antibacterial activity  against any of the bacterial species tested (s. aureus, e. faecalis, e. coli, s.  salivarius, pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus mutans, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans) was not affected by repeated exposure to the disinfection  treatment up to 40 times. this finding suggested that the risk of inducing bacterial resistance by disinfection treatment was low. the active ingredient of  this disinfection treatment is hydroxyl radicals generated by photolysis of h2o2. therefore, hydroxyl radicals interact with several cell structures and different  metabolic pathways in microbial cells, probably resulting in a lack of development of bacterial resistance. in conclusion, disinfection treatment with photolysis of h2o2 appears to be a potential alternative for existing antimicrobial agents in terms of a low risk of inducing bacterial resistance.

TI  == antibacterial efficacy of a human beta-defensin-3 peptide on multispecies biofilms.
AB  == introduction: the aggregation of mixed bacterial flora into sessile biofilms on root canal surfaces can be one of the causes of persistent apical periodontitis.  the aim of this study was to evaluate the antibacterial efficacy of human beta-defensin-3 (hbd3) peptide on multispecies biofilms by using confocal laser scanning microscopy. methods: actinomyces naeslundii, lactobacillus salivarius, streptococcus mutans, and enterococcus faecalis were cultured in a peptone-yeast-glucose broth, and their culture suspensions were combined in equal proportions. the mixed bacteria were inoculated on sterile coverslips placed into the wells of tissue culture plates to permit the formation of mixed species biofilm. after incubation for 3 weeks, the samples were treated for 24 hours with saline (control), saturated calcium hydroxide solution (ch), 2% chlorhexidine solution (chx), and 50 mug/ml hbd3 solution. a commercial biofilm/viability assay kit was used to assess cell viability and analyze the 3-dimensional architecture  of biofilms. the percentage of dead cells was determined from the ratio of biovolumes for the red subpopulation and the total biofilm. results: three medication groups showed a significant reduction of biovolume within the biofilms compared with the control group (p < .001). the hbd3-treated biofilms had a higher percentage of dead cells than the other medication groups (p < .05). the ch and chx groups showed higher levels of bactericidal activity than saline (p <  .05), and there was no significant difference between the 2 groups (p > .05). conclusions: hbd3 peptide exhibited more antibacterial activity against mature multispecies biofilms in vitro than either ch or chx.

TI  == evaluation of the nanosphere verigene gram-positive blood culture assay with the  versatrek blood culture system and assessment of possible impact on selected patients.
AB  == the verigene gram-positive blood culture (bc-gp) assay (nanosphere, northbrook, il) is a molecular method for the rapid identification of gram-positive organisms and resistance markers directly from blood culture bottles. a total of 148 versatrek redox 1 40-ml aerobic bottles demonstrating gram-positive bacteria were tested. results were compared with those from conventional biochemical and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (maldi-tof) identifications. we obtained isolates of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) (24), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa) (14), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis (mrse) (17), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus epidermidis (msse) (9), other coagulase-negative staphylococci (19), streptococcus salivarius (5), streptococcus parasanguinis (2), streptococcus sanguinis (1), streptococcus cristatus (1), the streptococcus bovis group (5), streptococcus agalactiae (9), the streptococcus anginosus group (1), streptococcus pneumoniae (6), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vre fcm) (16), vancomycin-susceptible  enterococcus faecalis (3), aerococcus viridans (2), bacillus (6), corynebacterium (8), lactobacillus (2), micrococcus (2), neisseria mucosa (1), escherichia coli (3), candida tropicalis (1), propionibacterium (1), and rothia (1). overall agreement with the culture results was 95%. a total of 137 of 138 (99%) monomicrobial cultures were concordant. we tested 9 polymicrobial samples and found 33% agreement. a chart review of 31 patients with mrsa, mssa, or vre demonstrated that the nanosphere bc-gp assay might have led to more appropriate antibiotic selection for these patients an average of 42 h earlier. additionally, contact isolation could have been initiated an average of 37 h earlier for patients with mrsa or vre. the bc-gp assay may have a positive impact on patient  care, health care costs, and antibiotic stewardship.

TI  == effect of metalloporphyrins on red autofluorescence from oral bacteria.
AB  == the aim of this study was to assess the red autofluorescence from bacterial species related to dental caries and periodontitis in the presence of different nutrients in the growth medium. bacteria were grown anaerobically on tryptic soy  agar (tsa) supplemented with nutrients, including magnesium-porphyrins from spinach and iron-porphyrins from heme. the autofluorescence was then assessed at  405 nm excitation. on the tsa without additives, no autofluorescence was observed from any of the species tested. on the tsa containing sheep blood, red autofluorescence was observed only from parvimonas micra. when the tsa was supplemented with blood, hemin, and vitamin k, red autofluorescence was observed  from actinomyces naeslundii, bifidobacterium dentium, and streptococcus mutans. finally, on the tsa supplemented with spinach extract, red autofluorescence was observed from aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, a. naeslundii, enterococcus  faecalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, lactobacillus salivarius, s. mutans, and veillonella parvula. we conclude that the bacteria related to dental caries and periodontal disease exhibit red autofluorescence. the autofluorescence characteristics of the tested strains depended on the nutrients present, such as  metalloporphyrins, suggesting that the metabolic products of the oral biofilm could be responsible for red autofluorescence.

TI  == bacteriocin production, antibiotic susceptibility and prevalence of haemolytic and gelatinase activity in faecal lactic acid bacteria isolated from healthy ethiopian infants.
AB  == the objective of this study was to characterise lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from faecal samples of healthy ethiopian infants, with emphasis on bacteriocin production and antibiotic susceptibility. one hundred fifty lab were  obtained from 28 healthy ethiopian infants. the isolates belonged to lactobacillus (81/150), enterococcus (54/150) and streptococcus (15/150) genera.  lactobacillus species were more abundant in the breast-fed infants while enterococcus dominated the mixed-fed population. bacteriocin-producing lab species were isolated from eight of the infants. many different bacteriocins were identified, including one new bacteriocin from streptococcus salivarius, avicin a (class iia) from enterococcus avium, one class iia bacteriocin from enterococcus  faecalis strains, one unknown bacteriocin from e. faecalis and two unknown bacteriocins from lactobacillus fermentum strains and the two-peptide gassericin  t from lactobacillus gasseri isolate. susceptibility tests performed for nine antibiotics suggest that some lactobacilli might have acquired resistance to erythromycin (3 %) and tetracycline (4 %) only. the streptococci were generally antibiotic sensitive except for penicillin, to which they showed intermediate resistance. all enterococci were susceptible to ampicillin while 13 % showed penicillin resistance. only one e. faecalis isolate was vancomycin-resistant. tetracycline (51 %) and erythromycin (26 %) resistance was prevalent among the enterococci, but multidrug resistance was confined to e. faecalis (47 %) and enterococcus faecium (33 %). screening of enterococcal virulence traits revealed  that 2 % were beta-haemolytic. the structural genes of cytolysin were detected in 28 % of the isolates in five enterococcal species, the majority being e. faecalis and enterococcus raffinosus. this study shows that bacteriocin production and antibiotic resistance is a common trait of faecal lab of ethiopian infants while  virulence factors occur at low levels.

TI  == inhibition of candida albicans yeast-hyphal transition and biofilm formation by solidago virgaurea water extracts.
AB  == xerostomia is a decrease of saliva secretion, which can unbalance the oral microflora, mainly to the benefit of candida albicans. the aim of the present study was to find a plant extract that could create an unfavourable environment for candida, and would, therefore, be appropriate for use in a dry-mouth daily-care mouthwash. water extract from the herbaceous plant solidago virgaurea  (goldenrod) was selected due to its saponin content (plant detergents). saponin concentrations reached 0.7 and 0.95 mg ml(-1) in s. virgaurea subsp. virgaurea and s. virgaurea subsp. alpestris extracts, respectively. c. albicans was grown in liquid medium and cells were counted by microscopic examination after 0, 4 and 24 h of incubation. solidago extracts did not inhibit the growth of c. albicans (four strains), escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus,  streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius or enterococcus faecalis. when inocula were incubated with solidago extract for 4 and 24 h, we observed a decrease in candida yeast-hyphal transition. candida biofilms were then prepared  in microtitre plates and treated with plant extracts at 0 h, to estimate biofilm  formation, or at 18 h to estimate the effect of the saponin on pre-formed biofilms. biofilm formation and pre-formed biofilms were both strongly inhibited. in conclusion, the s. virgaurea extract was efficient against two key virulence factors of c. albicans: the yeast-hyphal transition phase and biofilm formation.

TI  == development of a multispecies biofilm community by four root canal bacteria.
AB  == introduction: the development of multispecies biofilm models are needed to explain the interactions that take place in root canal biofilms during apical periodontitis. the aim of this study was to investigate the ability of 4 root canal bacteria to establish a multispecies biofilm community and to characterize  the main structural, compositional, and physiological features of this community. methods: four clinical isolates isolated from infected root canals, actinomyces naeslundii, lactobacillus salivarius, streptococcus gordonii, and enterococcus faecalis, were grown together in a miniflow cell system. simultaneous detection of the 4 species in the biofilm communities was achieved by fluorescence in situ  hybridization in combination with confocal microscopy at different time points. the live/dead baclight technique (molecular probes, carlsbad, ca) was used to assess cell viability and to calculate 3-dimensional architectural parameters such as biovolume (mum(3)). redox fluorescence dye 5-cyano-2,3-ditolyl tetrazolium chloride was used to assess the metabolic activity of biofilm bacteria. results: the 4 species tested were able to form stable and reproducible biofilm communities. the biofilms formed in rich medium generally showed continuous growth over time, however, in the absence of glucose biofilms showed significantly smaller biovolumes. a high proportion of viable cells (>90%) were generally observed, and biofilm growth was correlated with high metabolic activity of cells. the community structure of biofilms formed in rich medium did  not change considerably over the 120-hour period, during which e. faecalis, l. salivarius, and s. gordonii were most abundant. conclusions: the ability of 4 root canal bacteria to form multispecies biofilm communities shown in this study  give insights into assessing the community lifestyle of these microorganisms in vivo. this multispecies model could be useful for further research simulating stresses representative of in vivo conditions.

TI  == identification of lactobacilli residing in chicken ceca with antagonism against campylobacter.
AB  == bacteriocins produced by lactobacillus salivarius have been recently recognized as a natural means to control campylobacter and salmonella in live poultry. this  finding is of relevance since campylobacter jejuni and campylobacter coli are the predominant species isolated from poultry that are associated with human campylobacteriosis. in the present work, lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from the cecum of twenty tunisian chickens were identified and those isolates with antagonism against campylobacter were further characterized. following their preliminary confirmation as lab, 150 strains were identified by combining morphological criteria, biochemical tests, and molecular methods, the latter inluding intergenic 16s- 23s pcr, specific lactobacilli pcr, and a biphasic approach. most of the lab isolated belonged to the genus lactobacillus, among them lb. sakei (33.3%), lb. salivarius (19.4%), lb. reuteri (8.6%), and lb. curvatus (8.6%). the other lab strains included those of the genus weissella (16.7%), enterococcus faecalis (5.3%), leuconostoc mesenteroides (2.7%), lactococcus graviae (2.7%), and streptococcus sp. (2.7%). the lactobacilli strains were tested for their antagonism against c. jejuni and c. coli. the activity of three of them, lb. salivarius smxd51, lb. salivarius mms122, and lb.  salivarius mms151, against the aforementioned target strains could be ascribed to the production of bacteriocins.

TI  == evaluating the in-vitro antibacterial effect of iranian propolis on oral microorganisms.
AB  == propolis has traditionally been used in curing infections and healing wounds and  burns. current researches have shown that propolis has antibacterial, antifungal  and antiviral actions however, the pharmacological activity of propolis is highly variable depending on its geographic origin. there have been few studies on the effects of iranian propolis on the oral microorganisms. in this in-vitro study, the antimicrobial activity of the ethanolic and water extracts of the iranian propolis (10%, w/v) from north-east area of tehran was evaluated. susceptibility  of the oral strains tested (streptococcus mutans atcc 35668; streptococcus salivarius atcc 9222; staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923; enterococcus faecalis atcc 9854 and lactobacillus casei atcc 39392) was evaluated using the agar diffusion method at a concentration of 20 mg/ml of propolis and the zones of growth inhibition were measured. antibacterial activity was determined by using minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) at different concentrations of propolis. the ethanolic extract showed bacteriostatic and bactericidal activity against all the strains, with mic and mbc ranges of 250-500 microg/ml. the mic concentration of the water extract was 500 microg/ml against s. mutans and e. faecalis. the water extract showed bactericidal activity only against s. mutans (20 mg/ml). these results indicate that the ethanolic extract is probably more useful in the control of oral biofilms and subsequent dental caries development. however, to determine the consequence of the ethanolic extract of iranian propolis on the oral mucosa, in-vivo studies of its possible effects are needed.

TI  == characterization and transfer of antibiotic resistance in lactic acid bacteria from fermented food products.
AB  == the study provides phenotypic and molecular analyses of the antibiotic resistance in lactic acid bacteria (lab) from fermented foods in xi'an, china. lab strains (n = 84) belonging to 16 species of lactobacillus (n = 73), and streptococcus thermophilus (n = 11) were isolated and identified by sequencing their 16s rrna gene. all strains were susceptible to ampicillin, bacitracin, and cefsulodin, and intrinsically resistant to nalidixic acid, kanamycin, and vancomycin (except l. bulgaricus, l. acidophilus, and s. thermophilus, which were susceptible to vancomycin). some strains had acquired resistance for penicillin (n = 2), erythromycin (n = 9), clindamycin (n = 5), and tetracycline (n = 14), while resistance to gentamycin, ciprofloxacin, streptomycin, and chloramphenicol was species dependent. minimum inhibitory concentrations presented in this study will help to review microbiological breakpoints for some of the species of lactobacillus. the erm(b) gene was detected from two strains of each of l. fermentum and l. vaginalis, and one strain of each of l. plantarum, l. salivarius, l. acidophilus, l. animalis, and s. thermophilus. the tet genes were  identified from 12 strains of lactobacilli from traditional foods. this is the first time, the authors identified tet(s) gene from l. brevis and l. kefiri. the  erm(b) gene from l. fermentum nwl24 and l. salivarius nwl33, and tet(m) gene from l. plantarum nwl22 and l. brevis nwl59 were successfully transferred to enterococcus faecalis 181 by filter mating. it was concluded that acquired antibiotic resistance is well dispersed in fermented food products in xi'an, china and its transferability to other genera should be monitored closely.

TI  == ozone in dentistry: microbiological effects of gas action depending on the method and the time of application using the ozonytron device. experimental study.
AB  == introduction: bactericidal, virucidal, and fungicidal activity of ozone is generally known and has been exploited for years in industry and medicine. ozone  therapy became an inherent element of the treatment of infection in such fields as surgery, dermatology, cosmetics, and dentistry. ozone is a gas, so it penetrates very well even into such tissues and spaces that are not easily accessible. thanks to the property of deep penetration and long ozone presence in tissues after treatment, a long-lasting bactericidal effect is achieved. the action of oxygen radicals is, however, not neutral for the human organism, therefore the use of an appropriate procedure and therapy algorithms is essential. material and methods: we decided to confirm the effect of antibacterial activity of ozone applied by means of the ozonytron device (made by biozonix) on model strains of streptococcus salivarius, pneumonia, pyogenes, and  agalactiae, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus and epidermidis, using two application patterns developed by us. results: we found a statistically significant difference in the size of zones of inhibited bacterial growth on all  media depending on the time of action of ozone. in the present paper, the bactericidal activity of ozone in relation to bacterial strains that are most frequently isolated from the oral cavity was confirmed. what is more, two models  of application of the gas on the infected medium were compared. conclusion: research on the use of ozone in combatting bacteria typical for dental diseases has shown that the gas has an oxidizing effect on these bacteria and is bactericidal.

TI  == antibacterial activity of the essential oil from rosmarinus officinalis and its major components against oral pathogens.
AB  == the essential oil of rosmarinus officinalis l. (rosemary) was obtained by hydro-distillation and analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. sixty-two constituents were identified, representing 98.06% of the total oil content. oxygenated monoterpenes were the predominant components. the rosemary oil was characterized as having prominent (> 5%) contents of camphor (18.9%), verbenone (11.3%), a-pinene (9.6%), beta-myrcene (8.6%), 1,8-cineole (8.0%), and  beta-caryophyllene (5.1%). the antimicrobial activity of the oil as well as of its major constituents was tested against the following microorganisms: streptococcus mutans, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sobrinus, and enterococcus faecalis, which are potentially responsible for the formation of dental caries in humans. the microdilution method was used for determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) during evaluation of the antibacterial activity. the essential oil displayed low activity against the selected microorganisms. in the  present study, the pure major compounds were more active than the essential oil.  among all the microorganisms tested, the pathogen s. mitis was the most susceptible and e. faecalis was the most resistant to the evaluated samples. this is the first report on antimicrobial activity of the major components of rosemary oil against oral pathogens.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of rosmarinus officinalis against oral pathogens: relevance of carnosic acid and carnosol.
AB  == the in vitro inhibitory activity of crude etoh/h2o extracts from the leaves and stems of rosmarinus officinalis l. was evaluated against the following microorganisms responsible for initiating dental caries: streptococcus mutans, s. salivarius, s. sobrinus, s. mitis, s. sanguinis, and enterococcus faecalis. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) were determined with the broth microdilution method. the bioassay-guided fractionation of the leaf extract, which displayed the higher antibacterial activity than the stem extract, led to the identification of carnosic acid (2) and carnosol (3) as the major compounds in the fraction displaying the highest activity, as identified by hplc analysis.  rosmarinic acid (1), detected in another fraction, did not display any activity against the selected microorganisms. hplc analysis revealed the presence of low amounts of ursolic acid (4) and oleanolic acid (5) in the obtained fractions. the results suggest that the antimicrobial activity of the extract from the leaves of r. officinalis may be ascribed mainly to the action of 2 and 3.

TI  == detection of human intestinal catalase-negative, gram-positive cocci by rrna-targeted reverse transcription-pcr.
AB  == an analytical system based on rrna-targeted reverse transcription-quantitative pcr (rt-qpcr) for enumeration of catalase-negative, gram-positive cocci was established. subgroup- or species-specific primer sets targeting 16s or 23s rrna  from enterococcus, streptococcus, and lactococcus were newly developed. the rt-qpcr method using these primers together with the previously reported primer sets specific for the enterococcus genus, the streptococcus genus, and several streptococcus species was found to be able to quantify the target populations with detection limits of 10(3) to 10(4) cells per gram feces, which was more than 100 times as sensitive as the qpcr method (10(6) to 10(8) cells per gram feces).  the rt-qpcr analysis of fecal samples from 24 healthy adult volunteers using the  genus-specific primer sets revealed that enterococcus and streptococcus were present as intestinal commensals at population levels of log(10) 6.2 +/- 1.4 and  7.5 +/- 0.9 per gram feces (mean +/- standard deviation [sd]), respectively. detailed investigation using species- or subgroup-specific primer sets revealed that the volunteers harbored unique enterococcus species, including the e. avium  subgroup, the e. faecium subgroup, e. faecalis, the e. casseliflavus subgroup, and e. caccae, while the dominant human intestinal streptococcus species was found to be s. salivarius. various lactococcus species, such as l. lactis subsp.  lactis or l. lactis subsp. cremoris, l. garvieae, l. piscium, and l. plantarum, were also detected but at a lower population level (log(10) 4.6 +/- 1.2 per gram  feces) and prevalence (33%). these results suggest that the rt-qpcr method enables the accurate and sensitive enumeration of human intestinal subdominant but still important populations, such as gram-positive cocci.

TI  == infective endocarditis: identification of catalase-negative, gram-positive cocci  from blood cultures by partial 16s rrna gene analysis and by vitek 2 examination.
AB  == streptococci, enterococci and streptococcus-like bacteria are frequent etiologic  agents of infective endocarditis and correct species identification can be a laboratory challenge. viridans streptococci (vs) not seldomly cause contamination of blood cultures. vitek 2 and partial sequencing of the 16s rrna gene were applied in order to compare the results of both methods. strains originated from  two groups of patients: 149 strains from patients with infective endocarditis and 181 strains assessed as blood culture contaminants. of the 330 strains, based on  partial 16s rrna gene sequencing results, 251 (76%) were vs strains, 10 (3%) were pyogenic streptococcal strains, 54 (16%) were e. faecalis strains and 15 (5%) strains belonged to a group of miscellaneous catalase-negative, gram-positive cocci. among vs strains, respectively, 220 (87,6%) and 31 (12,3%) obtained agreeing and non-agreeing identifications with the two methods with respect to allocation to the same vs group. non-agreeing species identification mostly occurred among strains in the contaminant group, while for endocarditis strains notably fewer disagreeing results were observed.only 67 of 150 strains in the mitis group strains obtained identical species identifications by the two methods. most vs strains belonging to the groups of salivarius, anginosus, and mutans obtained agreeing species identifications with the two methods, while this only was the case for 13 of the 21 bovis strains. pyogenic strains (n=10), enterococcus faecalis strains (n=54) and a miscellaneous group of catalase-negative, gram-positive cocci (n=15) seemed well identified by both methods, except that disagreements in identifications in the miscellaneous group  of strains occurred for 6 of 15 strains.

AB  == rhodomyrtone [6,8-dihydroxy-2,2,4,4-tetramethyl-7-(3-methyl-1-oxobutyl)-9-(2-methylpropyl)-4,9 -dihydro-1h-xanthene-1,3(2h)-di-one] from rhodomyrtus tomentosa (aiton) hassk. displayed significant antibacterial activities against gram-positive bacteria including bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus salivarius. especially noteworthy was the activity against mrsa with a minimum inhibitory concentration  (mic) and a minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) ranging from 0.39 to 0.78 microg/ml. as shown for s. pyogenes, no surviving cells were detected within 5 and 6h after treatment with the compound at 8mbc and 4mbc concentrations, respectively. rhodomyrtone displays no bacteriolytic activity, as determined by measurement of the optical density at 620 nm. a rhodomyrtone killing test with s. mutans using phase contrast microscopy showed that this compound caused a few morphological changes as the treated cells were slightly changed in color and bigger than the control when they were killed. taken together, the results support the view that rhodomyrtone has a strong bactericidal activity on gram-positive bacteria, including major pathogens.

TI  == streptococci and lactococci synthesize large amounts of hpr(ser-p)(his~p).
AB  == hpr is a protein of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase transport system (pts). in gram-positive bacteria, hpr can be phosphorylated on ser-46 by the kinase/phosphorylase hprk/p and on his-15 by phospho-enzyme i (ei~p) of the pts. in vitro studies with purified hprs from bacillus subtilis, enterococcus faecalis, and streptococcus salivarius have indicated that the phosphorylation of one residue impedes the phosphorylation of the other. however, a recent study showed that while the rate of streptococcus salivarius hpr phosphorylation by ei~p is reduced at acidic ph, the phosphorylation of hpr(ser-p) by ei~p, generating hpr(ser-p)(his~p), is stimulated. this suggests that hpr(ser-p)(his~p) synthesis may occur in acidogenic bacteria unable to maintain their intracellular ph near neutrality. consistent with this hypothesis, significant amounts of hpr(ser-p)(his~p) have been detected in some streptococci. the present study was  aimed at determining whether the capacity to synthesize hpr(ser-p)(his~p) is common to streptococcal species, as well as to lactococci, which are also unable  to maintain their intracellular ph near neutrality in response to a decrease in extracellular ph. our results indicated that unlike staphylococcus aureus, b. subtilis, and e. faecalis, all the streptococcal and lactococcal species tested were able to synthesize large amounts of hpr(ser-p)(his~p) during growth. we also showed that streptococcus salivarius iiablman, a protein involved in sugar transport by the pts, could be efficiently phosphorylated by hpr(ser-p)(his~p).

TI  == antimicrobial activity of kaurane diterpenes against oral pathogens.
AB  == two kaurane diterpenes, ent-kaur-16(17)-en-19-oic acid (ka) and 15-beta-isovaleryloxy-ent-kaur-16(17)-en-19-oic acid (ka-ival), isolated from aspilia foliacea, and the methyl ester derivative of ka (ka-me) were evaluated against oral pathogens. ka was the most active compound, with mic values of 10 microg ml(-1) against the following microorganisms: streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguinis, and lactobacillus casei. however, ka did not show significant activity against streptococcus salivarius and enterococcus faecalis, with mic values equal to 100  and 200 microg ml(-1), respectively. our results show that ka has potential to be used as a prototype for the discovery of new effective anti-infection agents against microorganisms responsible for caries and periodontal diseases. moreover, these results allow to conclude that minor structural differences among these diterpenes significantly influence their antimicrobial activity, bringing new perspectives to studies on the structure-activity relationship of this type of metabolites with respect to caries and periodontal diseases.

TI  == diversity of stress responses in dairy thermophilic streptococci.
AB  == exponential and stationary phase cells of 56 strains of the dairy streptococcus species s. thermophilus, s. macedonicus and s. salivarius, were exposed to acid,  osmotic, oxidative and heat stresses to investigate the diversity of their responses. three strains of dairy related streptococci, lactococcus lactis atcc11454, enterococcus faecium dsm20477 and enterococcus faecalis dsm20478, were included for comparison purposes. acid and heat adaptation and cross-protection to stress were studied in ten strains with different stress response patterns. cell death and the changes in protein expression were evaluated by plate counts and sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrilamide gel electrophoresis, respectively. all  strains of all species were highly tolerant of osmotic stress. with a few exceptions, acid and oxidative treatments reduced the number of viable cells by >5 log units but responses to heat stress were more variable. for some, but not all strains, stationary phase cells were more resistant to some or all stresses.  matrix cluster analysis was used to group strains on the basis of their pattern of stress response in seven clusters. significant associations between the sources of strains and stress resistance were found for acid and oxidative stresses. adaptation to stress during the exponential phase enhanced the survival of acid and heat stressed cells from 1 to 60,000-folds, but a detrimental effect  of adaptation on cell viability was evident for oxidative and osmotic stresses for three strains. adaptation and entry into the stationary phase resulted in significant changes of protein bands whose estimated molecular masses corresponded with those of proteins (dnak, gpre, groel, and groes) involved in the general stress response but no statistically significant correlation between  stress response and band intensity was evident.

TI  == purification of bacteriocin ls1 produced by human oral isolate lactobacillus salivarius bgho1.
AB  == introduction: lactobacillus salivarius bgho1, a human oral isolate with antagonistic activity against growth of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, micrococcus flavus, and salmonella enteritidis, probably produces more than one proteinaceous antimicrobial substance. the objective of this study was the purification of a bacteriocin, named ls1, produced by l. salivarius bgho1. methods: a simple and fast procedure for bacteriocin purification was developed, consisting of reverse-phase chromatography of the ammonium sulfate precipitate of cell-free culture supernatant by fast protein liquid chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography, followed by tricine sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide  gel electrophoresis (sds-page), with the subsequent extraction of bacteriocin from the gel. results: the supernatant of l. salivarius bgho1 culture retained its antimicrobial activity after boiling in a water bath for 15 min. its antimicrobial activity was also maintained even after treatment for 20 min at 121 degrees c in an autoclave. bacteriocin ls1 was purified to homogeneity. the molecular mass of bacteriocin ls1 was estimated to be approximately 10 kda, based on tricine sds-page. during purification, another compound with antimicrobial activity, produced by l. salivarius bgho1, was detected. the molecular mass of this compound was estimated to be approximately 5 kda, based on tricine sds-page. conclusion: our results imply that ls1 is most probably a new bacteriocin, different from previously described bacteriocins produced by l. salivarius strains. the purification of bacteriocin ls1 enabled the further characterization of ls1 on both the molecular and genetic levels.

TI  == antibacterial activity of triterpene acids and semi-synthetic derivatives against oral pathogens.
AB  == triterpene acids (ursolic, oleanoic, gypsogenic, and sumaresinolic acids) isolated from miconia species, along with a mixture of ursolic and oleanolic acids and a mixture of maslinic and 2-a-hydroxyursolic acids, as well as ursolic  acid derivatives were evaluated against the following microorganisms: streptococcus mutans, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sobrinus, and enterococcus faecalis, which are potentially responsible for the formation of dental caries in humans. the microdilution method was used for the determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) during the evaluation of the antibacterial activity. all the  isolated compounds, mixtures, and semi-synthetic derivatives displayed activity against all the tested bacteria, showing that they are promising antiplaque and anticaries agents. ursolic and oleanolic acids displayed the most intense antibacterial effect, with mic values ranging from 30 microg/ml to 80 microg/ml.  the mic values of ursolic acid derivatives, as well as those obtained for the mixture of ursolic and oleanolic acids showed that these compounds do not have higher antibacterial activity when compared with the activity observed with either ursolic acid or oleanolic acid alone. with regard to the structure-activity relationship of triterpene acids and derivatives, it is suggested that both hydroxy and carboxy groups present in the triterpenes are important for their antibacterial activity against oral pathogens.

TI  == evaluation of piper cubeba extract, (-)-cubebin and its semi-synthetic derivatives against oral pathogens.
AB  == the activities of the crude ethanol extract from piper cubeba seeds, (-)-cubebin  and its semi-synthetic derivatives were evaluated against oral pathogens. the crude ethanol extract was more active against streptococcus salivarius (mic value of 80 microg/ml). (-)-cubebin displayed mic values ranging from 0.20 mm for streptococcus mitis to 0.35 mm for enterococcus faecalis. the natural product (-)-cubebin and its semi-synthetic derivative (-)-hinokinin displayed bacteriostatic activity at all evaluated concentrations, as well as fungicidal activity against candida albicans at 0.28 mm. the o-benzyl cubebin derivative showed fungistatic and fungicidal effects against c. albicans at 0.28 mm and 0.35 mm, respectively. also, the other dibenzylbutyrolactone derivatives [(-)-6,6'-dinitrohinokinin and (-)-o-(n,n-dimethylaminoethyl)-cubebin] displayed  bacteriostatic and fungistatic effects at the evaluated concentrations. moreover, the semi-synthetic derivative (-)-6,6'-dinitrohinokinin was the most active compound against all the evaluated microorganisms. therefore, it may be suggested that the presence of the carbonyl group at c-9 plus the introduction of polar groups in the aromatic rings improve the antimicrobial activity of dibenzylbutyrolactone compounds.

TI  == molecular analysis of colonized bacteria in a human newborn infant gut.
AB  == the complex ecosystem of intestinal microflora is estimated to harbor approximately 400 different microbial species, mostly bacteria. however, studies  on bacterial colonization have mostly been based on culturing methods, which only detect a small fraction of the whole microbiotic ecosystem of the gut. to clarify the initial acquisition and subsequent colonization of bacteria in an infant within the few days after birth, phylogenetic analysis was performed using 16s rdna sequences from the dna isolated from feces on the 1st, 3rd, and 6th day. 16s rdna libraries were constructed with the amplicons of pcr conditions at 30 cycles and 50 degrees c annealing temperature. nine independent libraries were produced  by the application of three sets of primers (set a, set b, and set c) combined with three fecal samples for day 1, day 3, and day 6 of life. approximately 220 clones (76.7%) of all 325 isolated clones were characterized as known species, while other 105 clones (32.3%) were characterized as unknown species. the library clone with set a universal primers amplifying 350 bp displayed increased diversity by days. thus, set a primers were better suited for this type of molecular ecological analysis. on the first day of the life of the infant, enterobacter, lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc citreum, and streptococcus mitis were present. the largest taxonomic group was l. lactis. on the third day of the  life of the infant, enterobacter, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, s. mitis, and streptococcus salivarius were present. on the sixth day of the life of the infant, citrobacter, clostridium difficile, enterobacter sp., enterobacter cloacae, and e. coli were present. the largest taxonomic group was e. coli. these results showed that microbiotic diversity changes very rapidly in the few days after birth, and the acquisition of unculturable bacteria expanded rapidly after  the third day.

TI  == the gene encoding iiab(man)l in streptococcus salivarius is part of a tetracistronic operon encoding a phosphoenolpyruvate: mannose/glucose phosphotransferase system.
AB  == glucose and mannose are transported in streptococci by the mannose-pts (phosphoenolpyruvate:mannose phosphotransferase system), which consists of a cytoplasmic iiab protein, called iiab(man), and an uncharacterized membrane permease. this paper reports the characterization of the man operon encoding the  specific components of the mannose-pts of streptococcus salivarius. the man operon was composed of four genes, manl, manm, mann and mano. these genes were transcribed from a canonical promoter (pman) into a 3.6 kb polycistronic mrna that contained a 5'-utr (untranslated region). the predicted manl gene product encoded a 35.5 kda protein and contained the amino acid sequences of the iia and  iib phosphorylation sites already determined from purified s. salivarius iiab(man)l. expression of manl in escherichia coli generated a 35 kda protein that reacted with anti-iiab(man)l antibodies. the predicted manm protein had an estimated size of 27.2 kda. manm had similarity with iic domains of the mannose-eii family, but did not possess the signature proposed for mannose-iic proteins from gram-negative bacteria. from multiple alignment analyses of sequences available in current databases, the following modified iic(man) signature is proposed: gx3g[dnh]x3g[livm]2xg2[stl][lt][eq]. the deduced product of mann was a hydrophobic protein with a predicted molecular mass of 33.4 kda. the mann protein contained an amino acid sequence similar to the signature sequence of the iid domains of the mannose-eii family. mano encoded a 13.7 kda protein. this gene was also transcribed as a monocistronic mrna from a promoter located in the mann-mano intergenic region. a search of current databases revealed the presence of iiab(man)l, manm, mann and mano orthologues in streptococcus mutans, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae and enterococcus faecalis. this work has elucidated the molecular structure of the mannose pts in streptococci and enterococci, and demonstrated the presence of a putative regulatory protein (mano) within the man operon.

TI  == ctsr, a novel regulator of stress and heat shock response, controls clp and molecular chaperone gene expression in gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == clpp and clpc of bacillus subtillis encode subunits of the clp atp-dependent protease and are required for stress survival, including growth at high temperature. they play essential roles in stationary phase adaptive responses such as the competence and sporulation developmental pathways, and belong to the  so-called class iii group of heat shock genes, whose mode of regulation is unknown and whose expression is induced by heat shock or general stress conditions. the product of ctsr, the first gene of the clpc operon, has now been  shown to act as a repressor of both clpp and clpc, as well as clpe, which encodes a novel member of the hsp100 clp atpase family. the ctsr protein was purified and shown to bind specifically to the promoter regions of all three clp genes. random mutagenesis, dnasel footprinting and dna sequence deletions and comparisons were  used to define a consensus ctsr recognition sequence as a directly repeated heptad upstream from the three clp genes. this target sequence was also found upstream from clp and other heat shock genes of several gram-positive bacteria, including listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus salivarius, s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, s. thermophilus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, leuconostoc oenos, lactobacillus sake, lactococcus lactis and clostridium acetobutylicum. ctsr homologues were also identified in several of these bacteria, indicating that heat shock regulation by ctsr is highly conserved in gram-positive bacteria.

AB  == background: the evaluation of the reliability of a group of three tests: pyrrolidonil-arilamidase, rapid test in nacl esculin broth and group d antistreptococci agglutination for the rapid identification of the enterococcus genus were performed. methods: one hundred fifty-eight strains of streptococci: 110 strains of enterococcus faecalis, 8 e. faecium, 3 e. avium, 16 streptococcus  intermedius, 7 s. salivarius, 4 s. bovis, 4 s. constellatus, 2 s. sanguis and 1 strain of s. equinus, s. mitis, s. uberis and s. mutans were studied. the tests used were: rapid test in nacl- esculin broth, pyrrolidonyl-arilamidase and antigroup d streptococcus agglutination (patho dx strep d/pyr; diagnostic product corporation). all catalase-negative gram-positive cocci or coccibacilli which were positive in the three tests were considered to belong to the enterococcus genus. the usefulness of gram staining in culture in thioglycolate broth was also studied comparing it with the results obtained with solid medium. results: the results of the proposed identification scheme were evaluated calculating different parameters: sensitivity 98%, specificity 100%, positive predictive value, 100%, and negative predictive value 94%. no significant differences were observed between the results obtained with gram staining with thioglycolate broth and those obtained with solid medium except in the case of the streptococcus mutans strain. conclusions: the application of a combination of tests: pyrroidonyl-arilamidase, antistreptococci group d agglutination and rapid test in nacl-esculin broth to catalase-negative gram-positive cocci and coccobacilli allows reliable identification in a maximum of three hours of strains belonging to the enterococcus genus.

TI  == [serologic study in patients with streptococcal infective endocarditis].
AB  == background: infective endocarditis is a systemic disease in which there are a continuously antigenic stimulation of immunologic system. streptococcus is still  the most frequent cause of infective endocarditis. patients and methods: we investigated the presence of antibody (ab), total and igm by indirect immune fluorescence technique, in four groups of population: streptococcal infective endocarditis (sie), streptococcal bacteraemia (sb), staphylococcus aureus endocarditis, and healthy people. antigens used were: 1) their own strain isolated from the blood of patients with sie and sb inverted question markhomologous ab inverted question mark, and; 2) seven species of streptococcus: streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus bovis, streptococcus sanguis i, streptococcus sanguis ii, nutritional dependent streptococci and enterococcus faecalis (heterologous ab). results: homologous antibodies: titers > or = 1/512 were found in all patients with sie and only in 2 with sb (sensitivity 100% and specificity 93%). igm titer (threshold 1/32) was positive only in patients with sie (sensitivity 75,5% and specificity 100%). the  fall of the ab titer was continuous and slow, despite the good clinical evolution of patients. (ab titers were > or = 1/512 and igm > or = 1/64 in 30% of patients  1 year later). heterologous ab: in spite of statistically significant difference  found in sie versus the other groups, sensitivity of this test (threshold 1/256)  is low, confidence interval include expected random value (50%), specificity is 88%. conclusions: the utility of homologous ab for diagnosing infective endocarditis is demonstrated. on the contrary for heterologous ab, antigenic common fractions must be found in the different species.

TI  == inducer expulsion and the occurrence of an hpr(ser-p)-activated sugar-phosphate phosphatase in enterococcus faecalis and streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == inducer expulsion, a phenomenon in which rapidly metabolizable sugars cause cytoplasmic dephosphorylation and efflux of pre-accumulated sugar-phosphates (sugar-p), has been documented for streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus bovis, and lactococcus lactis, but not for other gram-positive bacteria. using intact cells and membrane vesicles, we show that enterococcus faecalis exhibits both inducer exclusion and inducer expulsion, and that the latter phenomenon is dependent on the metabolite-activated atp-dependent hpr(ser) kinase that phosphorylates ser-46 in hpr of the phosphotransferase system. a small, heat-stable, membrane-associated, hpr(ser-p)-activated sugar-p phosphatase (pase  ii), previously identified only in lc. lactis, is shown to be present in extracts of enterococcus faecalis and streptococcus pyogenes but not in those of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, or bacillis subtilis, organisms that do not exhibit the inducer expulsion phenomenon. further, lactobacillus brevis, an organism that exhibits inducer expulsion by a different mechanism, also apparently lacks pase ii. the results reveal that pase ii is present in those organisms that exhibit the coupled sugar-p hydrolysis/expulsion mechanism but not those that lack this mechanism. they provide correlative evidence that pase ii initiates inducer expulsion in species of enterococci, streptococci and lactococci.

TI  == [the isolation of streptococcus morbillorum from vaginal exudates].
AB  == we have tested 195 vaginal secretions sent by gynecology service of this hospital between the years 1988-1990. we achieved positive culture for streptococci in 58  (30%) of these cultures, 26 (44.8%) corresponding to streptococcus morbillorum 9  (15.5%), to gardnerella vaginalis 5 (8.6%), to enterococcus faecalis-durans and to streptococcus agalactiae, 3 (5.1%) to streptococcus mitis and milleri 2 (3.4%), to streptococcus bovis and cremoris, and 1 (1.7%) to streptococcus salivarius, equinus and sanguis ii respectively. we previously found that 52.8% of these patients were positive for vaginal candidiasis. the bacteriological identification done by the api 20 strep system (biomerieux gmbh, nutingen, germany) provides a typical pattern ("good identification") for the streptococcus morbillorum.

TI  == gram-positive cocci isolated from slaughtered poultry.
AB  == gram-positive cocci were found in all meat samples of poultry slaughtered and processed for retail sale, at incidence rates ranging from 10(2) cfu/ml to 1.35 x 10(6) cfu/ml and a mode between 8 x 10(5) and 9 x 10(5) cfu/ml for 75% of the samples. the 93 isolated strains were identified as belonging to the following species: enterococcus faecalis (48 strains), e. faecium (16), e. avium (7), e. durans (4), aerococcus viridans (10), streptococcus morbillorum (2), s. salivarius (1), s. sanguis (1), s. "milleri" (1), s. pneumoniae (1), s. acidominimus (1), and gemella haemolysans (1). these species, which mainly colonize the intestinal tract, but may also be found in other parts of both the human and animal body, are pathogens or potentially such. their presence is an indication of the fecal contamination of meat processed following gutting of slaughtered chickens (endogenous contamination). a count of the gram-positive cocci and enterobacteria detected showed that enterococci were present in a far greater number than coliform bacteria.

TI  == antilisterial activity by enterococci in a model predicting the temperature evolution of taleggio, an italian soft cheese.
AB  == enterococcus ssp. produced broad-spectrum bacteriocins, which were active against listeria innocua and listeria monocytogenes. inhibition of l. innocua in milk by  different starter cultures was evaluated. milk was inoculated with a conventional starter (streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus and lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus mixed cultures) as a sole starter or in combination with inhibitory starter cultures (enterococcus ssp., bacteriocin-producing strains). tests were performed under a temperature gradient that reproduced the first 55 h  of taleggio cheese manufacturing and in the presence of rennet. results indicated that satisfactory inhibition of l. innocua was linked to the combined synergistic antimicrobial effect of ph decrease and bacteriocin production. overall, data suggested that a potential existed for use of the antagonistic activity from enterococci for protection of taleggio cheese during ripening, when l. monocytogenes may often reach dangerous concentrations.

TI  == development of a dna probe for streptococcus bovis by using a cloned amylase gene.
AB  == streptococcus bovis is a normal inhabitant of the rumen but has been implicated as a causative agent for ruminal lactic acidosis and related problems. while rarely isolated from humans, s. bovis has been identified as a causative agent for endocarditis, meningitis, and septicemia. recent reports have also suggested  a correlation between human colonic carcinoma and increased levels of s. bovis. identification of s. bovis strains of human origin has been problematic because of variations in results of biochemical tests compared with results for ruminal strains. we have tested a cloned amylase gene from the ruminal strain s. bovis jb1 as a potential dna probe for rapid and accurate identification of s. bovis strains from all sources. dnas from strains identified as s. bovis, of both human and ruminal origin, were found to hybridize with the probe under stringent conditions. the probe also hybridized with variants of s. bovis that did not grow on starch. the probe did not hybridize with dna isolated from other bacteria of human colonic and ruminal origin, including bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides ruminicola, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, and enterococcus faecalis but  did demonstrate hybridization with streptococcus salivarius.

TI  == the cell-bound fructosyltransferase of streptococcus salivarius: the carboxyl terminus specifies attachment in a streptococcus gordonii model system.
AB  == the ftf gene, coding for the cell-bound beta-d-fructosyltransferase (ftf) of streptococcus salivarius atcc 25975, has been analyzed, and its deduced amino acid sequence has been compared with that of the secreted ftf of streptococcus mutans and the levansucrases (sacbs) of bacillus species. a unique proline-rich region detected at the c terminus of the ftf of s. salivarius preceded a hydrophobic terminal domain. this proline-rich region was shown to possess strong homology to the product of the prgc gene from pcf10 in enterococcus faecalis, which encodes a pheromone-responsive protein of unknown function, as well as homology to the human proline-rich salivary protein prp-4. a series of 3'-oh deletions of the s. salivarius ftf gene expressed in streptococcus gordonii challis lgr2 showed that the c terminus was required for cell surface attachment  in this heterologous organism, as only the complete gene product was cell bound.  this cell-bound activity was released in the presence of sucrose, suggesting that the mode of attachment and release of the s. salivarius ftf in s. gordonii was similar to that in its native host.

TI  == the distribution of homologous enterococcal plasmid dna sequences in human faecal isolates.
AB  == hybridization was used to investigate the distribution of enterococcal plasmid sequences among 306 strains of enterococcus and streptococcus spp. isolated from  faeces of humans of various ages. as dna probes for the survey three plasmids, whose dnas did not hybridize each other and designated as pms13, ptw34 and phk30, were selected from plasmids borne in ent. faecalis. ptw34 dna hybridized only with dnas from enterococci, with high frequency in ent. faecalis and low frequency in ent. faecium. pms13 dna hybridized with dnas of all enterococcus spp. tested and with strep. bovis, strep. equinus and strep. salivarius. eighty-five percent of ent. faecium isolates had sequences homologous to pms13 but in the other species the values were less than 60%. some enterococci had dnas which hybridized with the phk30 probe. the different distribution of the three dna sequences indicates the possibility that plasmid dnas encode advantageous phenotypes for the colonization of bacteria in the lumen of the bowel.

TI  == coaggregation of streptococcus sanguis and other streptococci with candida albicans.
AB  == thirteen strains of viridans group streptococci and two strains of other streptococci were tested for coaggregation with candida albicans. streptococcus sanguis strains generally exhibited low levels of adherence to 28 degrees c-grown exponential-phase yeast cells, but starvation of yeast cells for glucose at 37 degrees c (or at 28 degrees c) increased their coaggregating activity with these  streptococci by at least tenfold. this was a property common to four c. albicans  strains tested, two of which were able to form mycelia (6406 and men) and two of  which were not (mm2002 and ca2). the expression of the coaggregation adhesin during yeast cell starvation was inhibited by addition of trichodermin or amphotericin b. the strains of s. sanguis, streptococcus gordonii, and streptococcus oralis tested for coaggregating activity encompassed a diverse range of physiological and morphological types, yet all exhibited saturable coaggregation with starved c. albicans cells. there was no correlation of cell surface hydrophobicity, of either yeast or streptococcal cells, with their abilities to coaggregate. strains of streptococcus anginosus also coaggregated with starved yeast cells; streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus pyogenes coaggregated to a lesser degree with c. albicans, and the coaggregation with s. pyogenes was not promoted by yeast cell starvation; streptococcus mutans and enterococcus faecalis did not coaggregate with yeast. the coaggregation reactions of s. sanguis and s. gordonii with c. albicans were inhibited by edta and by heat or protease treatment of the yeast cells and were not reversible by the addition  of lactose or other simple sugars. these observations extend the range of intergeneric coaggregations that are known to occur between oral microbes and suggest that coaggregations of c. albicans with viridans group streptococci may be important for colonization of oral surfaces by the yeast.

AB  == delayed type hypersensitivity of patients with behcet's disease was investigated  by intradermal skin test and prick test, using various inactivated microorganisms as antigens. in the intradermal skin test, 13 patients showed significantly increased skin reactivity to e. faecalis, compared with 5 normal controls. no significant differences were observed between these two groups in terms of reaction to s. pyogenes. prick test was performed in 11 patients and 6 controls,  using s. pyogenes, s. sanguis, s. salivarius and e. faecalis as antigens. it was  shown that patients with this disease had significantly greater skin reactions to crude cell wall antigens, as well as to whole cell antigens of these streptococci than the controls. the antigenicity of streptococci seemed to be present mainly in the cell wall fragment, and these streptococci seemed to have cross reactivity with each other. these results suggest that streptococci may have some significant role in the immunopathogenesis of this disease.

AB  == the relationship between the selective abilities of bacteria to adhere and their  predilections for colonizing different mammalian hosts was investigated by using  bacteria indigenous to the tongue dorsum of humans and rats as models. streptococcus salivarius and s. sanguis averaged 22.6 and 2.8%, respectively, of  the cultivable bacteria recovered from swab samples of the tonges of five humans, but these organisms were not indigenous on the tongues of rats (charles river strain). s. faecalis and serum-requiring diphtheroids were consistently prominant on the tongues of rats, but they were not detected on the tongues of the humans examined. the ability of these organisms to adhere to the tongue surface of the hosts was compared by introducing mixtures of streptomycin-resistant strains into the mouths of human volunteers and rats. s. salivarius adhered in higher proportions to the dorsal tongue surface of humans than did strains of s. faecalis and the serum-requiring diphtheroid. s. sanguis also adhered to human tongues better than the serum-requiring diphtheroid. however, s. faecalis and the serum-requiring diphtheroid sorbed in higher proportions to the tongues of rats.  in an in vivo assay, human strains of s. pyogenes and s. salivarius attached in higher numbers to buccal epithelial cells derived from humans than to those obtained from rats, whereas the reverse was observed with a serum-requiring diphtheroid derived from rats. collectively, these studies show that bacteria sorb with a high degree of specificity to the tissues of different mammalian hosts, and the relative adherence of the organisms studied correlated with their  natural host tropisms. the selective adherence of s. salvarius and s. faecalis was similar to the tongues of conventional and germ-free rats, suggesting that the presence of an indigenous bacterial flora did not significantly influence their attachment selectivity. moreover, the ability of these organisms to colonize the tongues of gnotobiotic rats lacking an indigenous flora paralleled their adherence selectivity. direct scanning microscopic observations indicated that the tongue dorsum of conventional rats is highly papillated but contains relatively sparse bacterial populations. indigenous organisms colonized the bases of papillae on the anterior tip and lateral edges of the tongue as discrete microcolonies, but bacteria were rarely observed on other papillae. this localized and restricted pattern of colonization and the spatial distribution of  the microcolonies of indigenous bacteria present also suggest that antagonistic interactions are unlikely to account for the bacterial tropisms observed for colonization of the tongues of rats.

TI  == membrane filter technique for enumeration of enterococci in marine waters.
AB  == a membrane filter procedure is described for the enumeration of enterococci in marine waters. the procedure utilizes a highly selective and somewhat differential primary isolation medium followed by an in situ substrate test for identifying colonies of those organisms capable of hydrolyzing esculin. the procedure (me) was evaluated with known streptococci strains and field samples with regard to its accuracy, sensitivity, selectivity, precision, and comparability to existing methods. essentially quantitative recovery was obtained with seawater-stressed cells of streptococcus faecalis and s. faecium. neither s. bovis, s. equinus, s. mitis, nor s. salivarius grew on the medium. the selectivity of the medium was such that a 10,000-fold reduction in background organisms was obtained relative to a medium which contained no inhibitors and was incubated at 35 c. about 90% of those typical colonies designated as enterococci  confirmed as such and about 12% of the colonies not so designated were, in fact,  identified as enterococci. plate to plate variability across samples approximated that expected by chance alone. verified recoveries of enterococci from natural samples by the me procedure, on the average, exceeded those by the kf method by one order of magnitude.
