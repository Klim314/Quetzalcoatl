TI  == natural antimicrobials subtilosin and lauramide arginine ethyl ester synergize with conventional antibiotics clindamycin and metronidazole against biofilms of gardnerella vaginalis but not against biofilms of healthy vaginal lactobacilli.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to evaluate the ability of clindamycin and metronidazole to synergize with natural antimicrobials against biofilms of bacterial vaginosis (bv)-associated gardnerella vaginalis. minimum bactericidal concentrations for biofilm cells (mbcs-b) were determined for each antimicrobial. the mbcs-b of lauramide arginine ethyl ester (lae), subtilosin, clindamycin and metronidazole were 50, 69.5, 20 and 500 mug ml(-1), respectively. a checkerboard  assay and isobologram were used to analyze the type of interactions between these antimicrobials. the combination of metronidazole with natural antimicrobials did  not inhibit planktonic lactobacilli. clindamycin with either lae or with subtilosin was inhibitory for planktonic but not for biofilm-associated lactobacilli. all tested antimicrobial combinations were inhibitory for bv-associated mobiluncus curtisii and peptostreptococcus anaerobius. lae and subtilosin synergized with clindamycin and metronidazole against biofilms of g. vaginalis but not biofilm-associated vaginal lactobacilli. the biofilms of bv-associated pathogens can be controlled by synergistically acting combinations  of conventional antibiotics and natural antimicrobials which will help better management of current antibiotics, especially considering robust bacterial resistance. our findings create a foundation for a new strategy in the effective  control of vaginal infections.

TI  == [quantitative analysis of individual groups of microorganisms, extracted from atherosclerotic lesions in the coronary arteries in patients depending upon asp299gly polymorphism of tlr4 gene].
AB  == the estimation data of contamination by separate groups of microorganisms and dependence of the microbial content level upon tlr4 gene 896a/g polymorphism in 20 samples of atherosclerotic lesions in coronary arteries has been presented. the presence of tlr4 gene polymorphic allele g in the individual genotype determines the increased contamination of atherosclerotic plaque tissues by the representatives of the following genera: lactobacillus sp., enterobacterium sp.,  sneathia sp./leptotrihia sp./fusobacterium sp., mobiluncus sp./corynebacterium sp., peptostreptococcus sp. the emergence of new correlation pairs with participation of lachnobacterium sp./corynebacterium sp. among the carriers of g  allele has been revealed via the intragroup correlation analysis. the obtained results confirm the possible involvement of the represented groups of microorganisms in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and the role of the tlr4 gene polymorphic variant g in the increased microbial contamination of the coronary arteries tissues.

TI  == [clinical effect of chitosan in bacterial vaginosis therapy].
AB  == aim: determination of antibacterial activity of acid-soluble chitosan in bacterial vaginosis therapy in women of reproductive age and comparison of therapy results of traditional scheme and local administration of acid-soluble chitosan. materials and methods: vaginal microflora of 76 gynecologic and obstetrical female patients (18-43 years of age) with bacterial vaginosis diagnosis was examined by using bacteriological method. control group consisted of 30 practically healthy women. sensitivity of 145 bacteria strains from 14 genera to 2% acid-soluble chitosan solution (200-250 kda molecularweight) was determined by using agar diffusion method. results: during bacterial vaginosis members of the gardnerella, mobiluncus and bacteroides genera dominated with a background reduction of lactobacilli quantity. an increase of population level of staphylococcus, enterococcus, prevotella, porphyromonas, peptostreptococcus genera members, and candida species was also observed. all the microorganisms were sensitive to 2% chitosan solution. mycoplasma and ureaplasma spp. were sensitive to chitosan in 82% of cases. administration of chitosan in local therapy of vaginosis resulted in suppression of opportunistic microflora and clinical effect with a lack of adverse effects. conclusion: local administration  of chitosan is perspective against bacterial vaginosis.

TI  == microarray-based identification of clinically relevant vaginal bacteria in relation to bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == objective: the objective was to examine the use of a tailor-made dna microarray containing probes representing the vaginal microbiota to examine bacterial vaginosis. study design: one hundred one women attending a health center for hiv  testing in south africa were enrolled. stained, liquid-based cytology slides were scored for bacterial vaginosis. an inventory of organisms was obtained using microarray technology, probing genera associated with bacterial vaginosis in more detail, namely gardnerella, atopobium, dialister, leptotrichia, megasphaera, mobiluncus, peptostreptococcus, prevotella, and sneathia. results: of 101 women,  34 were diagnosed positive for bacterial vaginosis. this condition was associated with an increased microbial diversity. it is no longer useful to base the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis on gardnerella alone. rather, its presence with  leptotrichia and prevotella species, and especially atopobium was more indicative of an aberrant state of the vaginal flora. conclusion: to understand the vaginal  microbiota in more detail, microarray-based identification can be used after microscopic scoring.

TI  == quantitative survival of aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms in port-a-cul and copan transport systems.
AB  == transport media should preserve the viability and stability of microorganisms in  clinical specimens. in this study, the port-a-cul transport system and the copan  transport system without charcoal, both designed to preserve anaerobes, were evaluated. dacron swabs were inoculated with two combinations of facultative and  anaerobic organisms typically found in vaginal swab samples. combination i contained candida albicans, escherichia coli, enterococcus spp., group b streptococci, lactobacillus crispatus, and staphylococcus aureus. combination ii  contained lactobacillus iners, peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus, mycoplasma hominis, prevotella bivia, prevotella corporis, porphyromonas asaccharolytica, mobiluncus curtisii, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and gardnerella vaginalis. duplicate swabs were placed into the two transporters and held for 24, 48, 72, and 96 h at 4 and 24 degrees c. both transporters maintained the viability of organisms better at 4 degrees c than at 24 degrees c. prevotella bivia and prevotella corporis had a loss of viability in both transporters at both temperatures. however, at 24 degrees c, there was a significantly greater loss of viability for mycoplasma hominis, prevotella bivia, prevotella corporis, and peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus when the organisms were stored in copan transport  medium than when they were stored in port-a-cul transport medium for 96 h (p < 0.002). some organisms proliferated in the transport media, but when transporters were held at 24 degrees c for 96 h, a significantly greater increase in the concentrations of group b streptococci and candida albicans, escherichia coli, and enterococcus spp. organisms in copan medium than in port-a-cul medium was observed (p < 0.002). at room temperature, the port-a-cul system is superior to the copan system with respect to the preservation of fastidious microorganisms and the prevention of the proliferation of facultative organisms.

TI  == in vitro activity of linezolid and eperezolid, two novel oxazolidinone antimicrobial agents, against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == linezolid (formerly u-100766) and eperezolid (formerly u-100592) are novel oxazolidinone antimicrobial agents that are active against multi-drug-resistant staphylococci, streptococci, enterococci, corynebacteria, and mycobacteria. preliminary studies also demonstrated that the compounds inhibited some test strains of anaerobic bacteria. therefore, we extended the in vitro evaluation of  these agents to include a total of 54 different anaerobic species. minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) values were determined using a standard agar dilution method for 143 anaerobic bacterial isolates. eperezolid and linezolid demonstrated potent activity against the anaerobic gram-positive organisms with most mic values in the range of 0.25-4 microg/ml. viridans streptococci demonstrated mics of 1-2 microg/ml; peptostreptococcus species and propionibacterium species were inhibited by </=0.25-1 microg/ml. clostridial species were generally susceptible to the oxazolidinones (mics of </=0.25-8 microg/ml); however, seven strains of clostridium difficile with linezolid mics of 16 microg/ml or greater were detected. against the anaerobic gram-negative organisms, linezolid was more potent than eperezolid, especially for bacteroides  species. linezolid inhibited most bacteroides in the range of 2-8 microg/ml, while eperezolid was generally two- to eight-fold less active. linezolid and eperezolid both demonstrated potent activity against fusobacterium species,mobiluncus species,prevotella intermedia, and porphyromonas asaccharolytica (mics of </=0.25-0.5 microg/ml). overall, the oxazolidinones demonstrated a significant level of activity against a number of clinically-important anaerobic bacterial species. linezolid may potentially provide a broader spectrum of anaerobic coverage than eperezolid due to its greater activity against bacteroides species.

TI  == vaginal microflora associated with bacterial vaginosis in nonpregnant women: reliability of sialidase detection.
AB  == objective: to determine the prevalence of gardnerella vaginalis, anaerobic bacteria and mycoplasma hominis in vaginal specimens of women with and without bacterial vaginosis (bv) as well as to determine the sensitivity and specificity  of the direct sialidase assay of vaginal fluid as a rapid test for diagnosing this syndrome. methods: vaginal cultures were obtained from 109 nonpregnant women (mean age 33 +/- 7.1 years), 47 of them with clinical signs of bv (bv+) and 62 of them without bv (bv-). in addition, we determined the vaginal sialidase activity  in both groups, which may serve as a feature of this syndrome. results: anaerobic bacteria were isolated in 91% and 18% of the bv+ and bv- groups, respectively (p  < 0.001). peptostreptococcus spp., prevotella bivia and porphyromonas spp. were strongly associated with bv. p. bivia and prevotella spp. represented 44% of all  the anaerobes isolated in the bv+ group. all the isolated p. bivia strains presented sialidase activity. g. vaginalis and m. hominis were isolated in 76% and 42% of the bv+ and 1% and 0% of the bv- women, respectively (p < 0.001). mobiluncus morphotypes were observed in 34% of the bv+ and 0% of bv- women. sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of sialidase activity were 81%, 94%, 90% and 86%, respectively. conclusions: our  data demonstrate a strong association between g. vaginalis, m. hominis, and p. bivia and bv. sialidase activity and gram stain of vaginal fluid represent accurate methods for diagnosing bv.

TI  == bacterial vaginosis a "broad overview".
AB  == bacterial vaginosis (bv) was first reported in 1995 by gardner and dukes, who described the unique clinical signs and symptoms and the distinctive nature of the vaginal discharge associated with it. they also described a "new" causative organism, which they named "haemophilus vaginalis", subsequently renamed gardnerella vaginalis. bv is currently the most prevalent cause of infectious vaginitis among women attending for genitourinary diseases. bv has a complex microbiology. lactobacillus populations, which are usually dominant in healthy women, are replaced by a polymicrobial group of organisms that includes g. vaginalis, anaerobic gram-negative rods such as prevotella species, peptostreptococcus species, mycoplasma hominis, ureaplasma urealyticum, and often mobiluncus species. anaerobic bacteria produce enzymes, aminopeptidases, that degrade protein and decarboxylases that convert amino acids and other compounds to amines. those amines contribute to the signs and symptoms associated with the  syndrome, raising the vaginal ph and producing a discharge odor. the excessive amounts of bacteria characteristic of the syndrome attach to epithelial cell surfaces, resulting in "clue cell". nearly half the patients report no noticeable symptoms, but many develop a characteristic copious, malodorous discharge if untreated. results from epidemiologic studies have associated bv with serious upper genital tract infections and adverse pregnancy outcome. in particular, the  presence of bv in pregnant women increases the risk of preterm delivery, and evidence is now compelling that bv is a cause of preterm delivery. the interest in potential invasiveness of g. vaginalis has increased. however, virulence determinants have not been studied enough. the most important therapy includes clindamycin and metronidazole.

TI  == [bacterial vaginosis. epidemiology and risk factors].
AB  == bacterial vaginosis (bv) is a change in vaginal ecosystem where lactobacilli dominate, flora is absent or greatly reduced, and replaced with a mixed, predominantly anaerobic flora, consisting of gardnerella vaginalis, mycoplasma hominis, mobiluncus spp, bacteroides spp, prevotela spp, peptostreptococcus spp,  fusobacterium spp and porphyromonas spp. the concentration of bacteria increases  from 100 to 1000 fold in women with bv compared to healthy women. bv has been formerly known as nonspecific vaginitis, haemophilus vaginitis, corynebacterium vaginitis, gardnerella vaginitis and anaerobic vaginintis. bv is the most prevalent form of vaginal disturbances in reproductive age women. the average incidence of bv varies: 10-35% in patients visiting gynaecological wards, 10-30%  in patients visiting obstetric wards and 20-60% in patients visiting services of  sexually transmitted diseases. a typical clinical symptom of bv is malodorous vaginal discharge. however, more than 50% of all women with bv are asymptomatic.  bv has been associated with many gynaecological and obstetric complications such  as cervicitis, salpingitis, endometritis, postoperative infections, urinary tract infections, pelvic inflammatory disease, mild abnormal pap smear results and possible link with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, preterm delivery, premature rupture of the membranes, chorioamnionitis and postpartum endometritis. factors that increase the risk of bv are multiple partners, exposure to semen, prior trichomoniasis, intrauterine device usage, smoking, indigent population and frequent use of scented soap. diagnosis of bv is established by amsel's criteria  of which three of four are the following: presence of homogeneous discharge, vaginal fluid ph > 4.5, positive amine test and microscopic analysis of gram stained smear of vaginal discharge where "clue" cells (epithelial vaginal cells covered with mass of adherent bacteria, mostly coccobacilli) should be detected.  the treatment of patients with bv consist of metronidazole or clindamycin, per os or intravaginally. the treatment of asymptomatic women and male sex partners of women with bv is controversial. the aim of the study was to establish the occurrence rate of bv in our women and potential factors increasing the risk of bv. we examined 166 women at the institute of microbiology and immunology, university school of medicine, belgrade. diagnosis of bv was established by amsel's criteria. each woman filled in a special questionnaire. pregnant women were excluded. bv was diagnosed in 25% (33/166) of women. bv was more common among women with multiple partners. the most prevalent clinical symptom of bv was malodorous vaginal discharge. vaginal symptoms became more evident after intercourse. taking into consideration the occurrence rate of bv and its connection with numerous gynaecological and obstetric sequelae, and taking into account that the diagnosis of bv is quick, simple and inexpensive, we suggest that the examination of bv in women becomes a usual procedure.

TI  == [the range of antagonistic effects of lactobacillus bacterial strains on etiologic agents of bacterial vaginosis].
AB  == bacterial vaginosis is caused by uncontrolled sequential overgrowth of some anaerobic bacteria: gardnerella vaginalis, prevotella bivia, bacteroides spp., peptostreptococcus spp., mobiluncus sp. usually occurring in stable numbers in the bacterial flora of healthy women. on the other hand, different species of bacteria belonging to the genus lactobacillus, most frequently l. plantarum, l. rhamnosus and l. acidophilus, form a group of aerobic bacteria dominating in the  same environment. the diversity and density of their populations depend on the age and health conditions. thanks to their antagonistic and adherence properties  bacteria of the genus lactobacillus can maintain a positive balance role in this  ecosystem. the aim of this study was to assess the antagonistic properties of lactobacillus strains isolated from the vagina of healthy women against most common agents of bacterial vaginosis. it was found that nearly all of the tested  lactobacillus strains exerted distinct antagonistic activity against anaerobic bacteria: gardnerella vaginalis, prevotella bivia and peptostreptococcus anaerobius and quite a number also against gram-negative rods, while only some of them were able to inhibit gram-positive aerobic cocci as enterococcus faecalis or staphylococcus aureus.

TI  == in vitro inhibition of commercial douche products against vaginal microflora.
AB  == recently, vaginal douching has been associated with many health risks in women. the aim of this study was to analyze the effect of commercial douche products against various vaginal microorganisms, including lactobacilli. seven commercial  douches were tested against eight lactobacillus clinical isolates and three type  strains from the american type culture collection. bv-associated bacteria included six strains of five genera: gardnerella, mobiluncus, mycoplasma, peptostreptococcus, and ureaplasma. two isolates of group b streptococcus, and three species of candida were also tested. the minimal inhibition concentrations  and minimal contact times for these products against vaginal microorganisms were  determined in broth cultures. four antiseptic-containing douche products showed a strong inhibitory effect against all vaginal microorganisms tested with a short contact time (less than 1 min). three vinegar-containing douche products selectively inhibited vaginal pathogens associated with bacterial vaginosis, group b streptococcal vaginitis, and candidiasis, but not lactobacilli. the antimicrobial effects of the commercial douche products varied among different brands and microbial species tested.

TI  == evaluation of the oxyrase oxyplate anaerobe incubation system.
AB  == the oxyrase oxyplate anaerobe incubation system was evaluated for its ability to  support the growth of clinically significant anaerobic bacteria previously identified by the anaerobe reference laboratory at the centers for disease control and prevention. the results were compared with those obtained with conventional anaerobe blood agar plates incubated in an anaerobe chamber. we tested 251 anaerobic bacterial strains. plates were read at 24, 48, and 72 h; growth was scored by a numerical coding system that combines the degree of growth and the colony size. organisms (number of strains tested) used in this study were actinomyces (32), anaerobiospirillum (8), bacteroides (39), campylobacter (8), clostridium (96), fusobacterium (12), leptotrichia (8), mobiluncus (8), peptostreptococcus (16), and propionibacterium (24). at 24 h, 101 (40.2%) of the  251 strains tested showed better growth with the anaerobe chamber than with the oxyplate system, 10 (4.1%) showed better growth with the oxyplate system, and the remaining 140 (55. 8%) showed equal growth with both systems. at 48 h, 173 (68.9%) showed equal growth with both systems, while 78 (31.1%) showed better growth with the anaerobe chamber. at 72 h, 176 (70.1%) showed equal growth with both systems, while 75 (29.9%) showed better growth with the anaerobe chamber. the oxyplate system performed well for the most commonly isolated anaerobes but was inadequate for some strains. these results indicate that the oxyrase oxyplate system was effective in creating an anaerobic atmosphere and supporting the growth of anaerobic bacteria within 72 h. oxyplates would be a useful addition to the clinical microbiology laboratory lacking resources for traditional anaerobic  culturing techniques.

TI  == preterm birth: associations with genital and possibly oral microflora.
AB  == opportunistic pathogenic microbes are indigenous to the female lower genital tract and etiologic in many types of pelvic infections and, apparently, a portion of preterm birth (ptb) cases. bacterial vaginosis (bv) is a clinical syndrome based on an altered genital microflora in which gardnerella vaginalis; anaerobic  species primarily among prevotella, porphyromonas, bacteroides, peptostreptococcus, and mobiluncus; mycoplasma hominis; and ureaplasma urealyticum become predominant in vaginal secretions. this bv complex of microbes, compared to a normal vaginal microflora dominated by facultative lactobacilli, is associated with significantly increased risks for preterm labor, preterm premature rupture of membranes, ptb, and other perinatal infectious complications. pathogenetic mechanisms include an ascending route of infection and/or inflammatory process due to microbial products and maternal and/or fetal response(s) with production of prostaglandins and cytokines. in the presence of periodontal disease, oral opportunistic pathogens and/or their inflammatory products also may have a role in prematurity via a hematogenous route. fusobacterium nucleatum, a common oral species, is the most frequently isolated species from amniotic fluid cultures among women with preterm labor and intact membranes. also, the species and subspecies of fusobacteria identified from amniotic fluid most closely match those reported from healthy and diseased subgingival sites, namely f. nucleatum subspecies vincentii and f. nucleatum subspecies nucleatum, compared to strains identified from the lower genital tract. although these fusobacteria also could be acquired through cunnilingus from a partner, new data associating maternal periodontal disease with preterm low birth weight taken with the isolation of f. nucleatum, capnocytophaga, and other oral species from amniotic fluid support further study of a possible additional route, oral-hematogenous, to ptb.

TI  == distribution and mobility of the tetracycline resistance determinant tetq.
AB  == we tested 34 american type culture collection (atcc) and 168 clinical bacterial isolates, from the human urogenital and oral tracts and streptococci isolated from cows with mastitis, for the presence of the tetq gene using a polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay and dna-dna hybridization. the identities of pcr products were confirmed by southern blot hybridization of whole-cell dna. eleven  of the atcc strains were positive for tetq, including five bacteroides spp., five prevotella spp. and a single isolate of mitsuokella multiacidus. twenty-eight (29%) of the 95 clinical gram-negative isolates carried the tetq gene, while eight (11%) of the 73 clinical gram-positive isolates carried the tetq gene. this is the first description of tetq in gram-positive species. all isolates except one peptostreptococcus sp. carried tetq integrated into the chromosome. the tetq  gene could be transferred from prevotella bivia, bacteroides ovatus, bacteroides  fragilis, bacteroides vulgatus and bacteroides distasonis into an enterococcus faecalis recipient at frequencies of 10(-7)-10(-9) per recipient. in contrast, tetq failed to transfer from two isolates of prevotella intermedia, two isolates  of porphyromonas gingivalis, one isolate of mobiluncus curtisii and one isolate of peptostreptococcus sp. the latter two are gram-positive species. the pcr assay was used to screen 198 proteinase k-treated biopsies of prostate, periprostate and bladder from 84 men with prostatitis. thirty-four (40%) of the patients had one or more positive samples, suggesting that the pcr assay could be of value in  screening patient material directly for the presence of bacteria.

AB  == the vaginal flora of 118 japanese and 208 thai pregnant women were investigated for the presence of bacterial vaginosis (bv), bv-associated organisms, and bv-associated enzyme. a similar prevalence of bv was found among the japanese (13.6%) and thai women (15.9%). the microbial flora of women with bv were complex; the mean number of isolates recovered in the bv group was approximately  2 times more than that in a group of healthy women. prevotella species, porphyromonas species, peptostreptococcus species, mobiluncus species, gardnerella vaginalis, and h2o2-nonproducing lactobacilli were significantly associated with bv. these organisms were less associated with h2o2-producing lactobacilli, which were predominant in women with normal flora, suggesting that  h2o2-producing lactobacilli have antibacterial activity against bv-associated organisms. the vaginal sialidase assay by means of a filter-paper spot test was not proved to be a useful screening aid for diagnosis of bv because of the low sensitivity (69.4%) of this test.

TI  == bacteriological epidemiology and treatment of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == one hundred symptomatic women with clinical bacterial vaginosis (bv) were enrolled in this study. the bacteriological epidemiology of bv and efficacy of oral or vaginal administration of antimicrobial agents for treatment of bv were investigated. the epidemiology of bv was investigated before antimicrobial therapy. fifty patients were treated with oral administration of metronidazole (mtn), 500 mg twice a day, and 50 patients with 2% clindamycin (cldm) phosphate in a vaginal cream, 5 g once a day for 7 days. the major organisms occurring were streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, gardnerella vaginalis, peptostreptococcus species, bacteroides species, prevotella species, and mobiluncus species and opportunistic pathogens such as staphylococcus epidermidis and enterococcus faecalis. the therapeutic efficacy of cldm cream on bv appeared  to be preferable to oral mtn from clinical and bacteriological aspects. the clinical and bacteriological effectiveness of mtn and cldm in the treatment of bv suggests that anaerobes might play a major role in causing the clinical symptoms  in patients with bv.

AB  == the antibacterial activity of a new parenteral cephalosporin, fk037 was assessed  against recent aerobic and anaerobic strains isolated from patients in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology during the period between january 1992 and june 1993. the mics of fk037 for 90% of the clinical isolates tested were 0.10 microgram/ml for escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae, 0.20 microgram/ml for streptococcus agalactiae, 0.39 microgram/ml for gardnerella vaginalis, 0.78 microgram/ml for staphylococcus epidermidis, peptostreptococcus anaerobius and mobiluncus spp., 1.56 micrograms/ml for peptostreptococcus magnus, 3.13 micrograms/ml for methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, 25 micrograms/ml for methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), bacteroides fragilis and prevotella disiens, 100 micrograms/ml for bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and prevotella bivia; and > 100 micrograms/ml for enterococcus faecalis. fk037 was superior in potency  to ceftazidime against all strains except e. faecalis, p. anaerobius and p. bivia. it was 4- to 16-fold more active than cefotaxime against aerobic gram-positive bacteria and p. disiens, and its activity was similar to that of cefotaxime against the other strains. fk037 had 4- to 16-fold stronger activity than flomoxef against mrsa, s. agalactiae and e. coli and a similar activity to flomoxef against the other strains except g. vaginalis and b. fragilis that were  4-fold more sensitive to flomoxef than to fk037.

TI  == bacterial vaginosis and vaginal microorganisms in idiopathic premature labor and  association with pregnancy outcome.
AB  == the vaginal microflora of 49 women in idiopathic preterm labor was compared with  that of 38 term controls to determine whether the presence of bacterial vaginosis (bv) and/or specific microorganisms would influence the rate of preterm delivery. demographic factors, pregnancy outcome, and reproductive history were also studied. bv, as defined by the presence of clue cells in a vaginal wet mount and  characteristic microbial findings in a stained vaginal smear and vaginal culture, was more common in women with preterm labor and delivery than in controls (p < 0.01). the condition, diagnosed in 41% of women who had both preterm labor and delivery (n = 22) and in 11% each of women who had preterm labor but term delivery (n = 27) and controls, was associated with a 2.1-fold risk (95% confidence intervals, 1.2 to 3.7) for preterm birth prior to 37 weeks of gestation. bv was associated with low birth weight. of 49 women with preterm labor, 67% (8 of 12) of women with bv were delivered of low-birth-weight neonates (< 2,500 g) compared with 22% (8 of 37) of women without the condition (p < 0.0005). the presence of hydrogen peroxide-producing facultative lactobacillus spp. was strongly negatively associated with both preterm delivery and bv. bv-associated microorganisms, i.e., mobiluncus, prevotella, and peptostreptococcus species, porphyromonas asaccharolytica, fusobacterium nucleatum, mycoplasma hominis, and high numbers of gardnerella vaginalis were significantly associated with preterm delivery; all species also strongly associated with bv (p = 0.0001 for each comparison). mobiluncus curtisii and fusobacterium nucleatum were recovered exclusively from women with preterm delivery. our study clearly indicates that bv and its associated organisms are correlated with idiopathic premature delivery.

TI  == the microbiology of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == a group of microorganisms are present concurrently in high concentrations in the  vaginas of women with bacterial vaginosis. the major members of the group are gardnerella vaginalis, anaerobic gram-negative rods belonging to the genera prevotella, porphyromonas and bacteroides, peptostreptococcus species, mycoplasma hominis, ureaplasma urealyticum, and often mobiluncus species. facultative species of lactobacillus are present in lower concentrations and are less prevalent in bacterial vaginosis than in women with a normal vaginal examination. the exact microbe(s) responsible for bacterial vaginosis is unknown whether among the organisms listed above or an unknown agent. the high concentrations of anaerobic gram-negative rods, peptostreptococci, and other opportunistic pathogens in the lower genital tract place women with bacterial vaginosis at increased risk for genital infections and adverse pregnancy outcomes.

TI  == the normal vaginal flora, h2o2-producing lactobacilli, and bacterial vaginosis in pregnant women.
AB  == in this study of the vaginal flora of 171 pregnant women in labor at term, the flora was categorized as normal (lactobacillus predominant), intermediate, or representative of bacterial vaginosis (bv) on the basis of a vaginal smear. bv was diagnosed in 39 women (23%); the vaginal flora was classified as normal in 50% of cases and as intermediate in 27%. h2o2-producing lactobacilli were recovered from 5% of women with bv, 37% of those with an intermediate flora, and  61% of those with a normal flora. h2o2-negative lactobacilli were equally frequent (57%-65%) in all three groups. the microorganisms most frequently recovered from women with bv included gardnerella vaginalis, prevotella bivia/disiens, bacteroides ureolyticus, prevotella corporis/bacteroides levii, fusobacterium nucleatum, mobiluncus species, peptostreptococcus prevotii, peptostreptococcus tetradius, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, viridans streptococci, ureaplasma urealyticum, and mycoplasma hominis (p < .05 for each).  the presence of all but three of these organisms was inversely related to vaginal colonization by h2o2-producing lactobacilli; the exceptions were b. ureolyticus,  f. nucleatum, and p. prevotii. other microorganisms were equally frequent among women with and without bv. we conclude that specific groups of anaerobes are associated with bv in this population and that a strong association exists between species associated with bv and those inhibited by h2o2-producing lactobacilli.

TI  == recent taxonomic changes for anaerobic gram-positive and selected gram-negative organisms.
AB  == the strains formerly classified as streptococcus anginosus or "streptococcus milleri" have now been recognized as three distinct species, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus constellatus, and streptococcus intermedius. streptococcus morbillorum has been transferred into the genus gemella. four new species within the genus peptostreptococcus were recently named. a recent addition to the genus clostridium is clostridium argentinense, which includes clostridium botulinum type g. two new species of actinomyces have been introduced: actinomyces georgiae and actinomyces gerencseriae. arachnia propionica was shown to be related to propionibacteria and has been renamed propionibacterium propionicum. eubacterium yurii was named to contain "test-tube  brush" bacteria found in subgingival plaque. lactobacillus uli and lactobacillus  rimae are obligately anaerobic lactobacilli found in periodontal pockets. bilophila is a new genus of gram-negative bacilli. wolinella recta and wolinella  curva are now included in the genus campylobacter. the taxonomic position of mobiluncus, currently assigned to the family bacteroidaceae, remains uncertain.

TI  == in vitro activity of fk037, a new parenteral cephalosporin, against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the activity of fk037, a new parenteral cephalosporin, was compared with those of cefpirome, ceftazidime, and flomoxef against 322 recent clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria. a fastidious facultative anaerobe, gardnerella vaginalis, was also studied. fk037 inhibited 90% of isolates of peptostreptococcus anaerobius, peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, clostridium perfringens, mobiluncus spp., g. vaginalis, and porphyromonas gingivalis at < or = 0.78 micrograms/ml. the mics of fk037 for 50 and 90% of bacteroides fragilis isolates were 25 and > 200 micrograms/ml, respectively; the activity of fk037 was comparable to those of cefpirome and ceftazidime but lower than that of flomoxef. the activity of fk037  against fusobacterium nucleatum, fusobacterium varium, and bilophila wadsworthia  decreased when inoculum size was increased from 10(6) to 10(8) cfu/ml. little influence of inoculum size on the activity of fk037 was observed for other isolates tested. medium ph affected the activity of fk037 against f. varium (mics at phs 5 and 7, 3.13 and 100 micrograms/ml, respectively) and bacteroides gracilis (mics at phs 5 and 7, 12.5 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively) but not against other organisms tested. fk037 was less resistant than flomoxef to hydrolysis by beta-lactamase group 2e derived from b. fragilis gai 0558 and gai 10150.

TI  == [recent bacteriologic data: from physiopathology to treatment].
AB  == bacterial vaginosis is characterized by a change in the vaginal ecosystem in which lactobacillus spp, the dominant members of the normal flora, are replaced by an association of various bacterial species including gardnerella vaginalis, anaerobes (bacteroides spp, prevotella spp, porphyromonas spp, peptostreptococcus spp and mobiluncus spp) and mycoplasma hominis. the reasons for this imbalance are unknown, although the loss of lactobacilli that produce hydrogen peroxide (which is toxic for g. vaginalis and numerous anaerobes) may be an essential element. the introduction of one or several of these species into the vagina (they can occasionally be isolated in small numbers even in the absence of vaginosis) following intercourse or from the intestinal tract may also play a role. g. vaginalis itself is not considered to cause vaginosis, but is almost always present and multiplies rapidly; in addition, it has a high capacity for adherence to epithelial cells both in vivo and in vitro. it is now agreed that the concomitant growth of one or several anaerobic species is required for bacterial vaginosis to develop. our knowledge of the bacteriology of bacterial vaginosis has implications for diagnosis and treatment. it is now possible to obtain a precise bacteriologic diagnosis, not by culturing g. vaginalis (a costly and low-yield procedure), but by direct examination of the vaginal flora after gram staining, which shows the replacement of lactobacilli by a characteristic polymorphic flora. therapy is based on the use of antibiotics such as the imidazoles, which are active against g. vaginalis and anaerobes, but not against  the commensal lactobacilli.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == normal vaginal aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora of the rhesus macaque (macaca mulatta).
AB  == the most common bacterial species isolated from the vaginas of 37 healthy rhesus  macaques were streptococcus viridans, coagulase negative staphylococcus, mobiluncus curtisii ss. curtisii, corynebacterium renale-like organisms, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, gardnerella-like organisms, and other corynebacterium species. the vaginal flora of the rhesus macaque differs from that previously reported for five other primate species. a two-year retrospective review of clinical cases of vaginitis and metritis found escherichia coli and coagulase positive staphylococci to be the most common pathogens isolated.

TI  == bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis (bv) is the most common of the vaginitides affecting women of reproductive age. it appears to be due to an alteration in the vaginal ecology by which lactobacillus spp., the predominant organisms in the healthy vagina, are replaced by a mixed flora including prevotella bivia, prevotella disiens, porphyromonas spp., mobiluncus spp., and peptostreptococcus spp. all of these organisms except mobiluncus spp. are also members of the endogenous vaginal flora. while evidence from treatment trials does not support the notion that bv is sexually transmitted, recent studies have shown an increased risk associated with multiple sexual partners. it has also been suggested that the pathogenesis of bv may be similar to that of urinary tract infections, with the rectum serving as a reservoir for some bv-associated flora. the organisms associated with bv have also been recognized as agents of female upper genital tract infection, including pelvic inflammatory disease, and the syndrome bv has been associated with adverse outcome of pregnancy, including premature rupture of membranes, chorioamnionitis, and fetal loss; postpartum endometritis; cuff cellulitis; and urinary tract infections. the mechanisms by which the bv-associated flora causes  the signs of bv are not well understood, but a role for h2o2-producing lactobacillus spp. in protecting against colonization by catalase-negative anaerobic bacteria has been recognized. these and other aspects of bv are reviewed.

TI  == antibiosis between bacteria isolated from the vagina of women with and without signs of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == lactobacilli from women with and without bacterial vaginosis (bv) were tested for h2o2 production. thirty-seven (79%) of the 47 strains of lactobacilli isolated from the women without bv produced h2o2, while only nine (23%) of the 39 strains  of lactobacilli obtained from women with bv did so. five of 20 h2o2-producing and two of 26 non-producing strains of lactobacillus exhibited antibiosis against four of 12 strains of peptostreptococci and two of 10 strains of mobiluncus spp.  none of a further 41 different anaerobic and facultative anaerobic bacterial strains were inhibited by any of the isolates of lactobacilli tested. some strains of gardnerella vaginalis, bacteriodes spp., mobiluncus spp. and peptostreptococcus spp. inhibited the growth of three strains of lactobacilli belonging to different species. when the ph of the culture medium was increased from 6.0 to 6.5 this led to a decrease in the number of strains inhibited and/or  the size of the growth-inhibitory zones. different concentrations of h2o2 did not inhibit any of the strains tested. the growth-inhibitory effect of lactobacilli could not be related to their bacteriocin production. increasing the iron content of the medium by adding fecl3 (0.01 mm-1 mm) decreased or completely abolished the antibiosis.

TI  == relationship of bacteriologic characteristics to semen indices in men attending an infertility clinic.
AB  == bacteria can be isolated from most seminal fluid samples, but the significance of these microorganisms is uncertain because most men lack symptoms associated with  bacterial infection of the reproductive tract. we obtained semen samples from 37  men attending a special infertility clinic and assessed the relationship between  seminal fluid microorganisms and seminal fluid analysis including sperm motility, morphology, and concentration; the numbers of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and other white blood cells; and the hamster zona-free oocyte sperm penetration assay. aerobic and/or anaerobic bacteria were recovered from 36 of the 37 samples. one hundred eighty-eight isolates (113 aerobes, 74 anaerobes, and one yeast) were recovered, with a mean of 5.2 isolates per semen specimen. the microorganisms recovered from the samples included: coagulase-negative staphylococci (89%), viridans streptococci (65%), diphtheroids (86%), peptostreptococcus sp (62%), bacteroides sp (27%), gardnerella vaginalis (19%), lactobacillus sp (16%), actinomyces sp (16%), enterococcus (11%), and veillonella (11%). other microorganisms including group b streptococcus, hemophilus, escherichia coli, mobiluncus, and clostridium were each recovered from fewer than 10% of the specimens. when the microbiology of seminal fluid specimens with or without polymorphonuclear leukocytes was compared, the presence of polymorphonuclear leukocytes in the semen was not associated with the isolation of staphylococci (33 versus 25%), viridans streptococci (33 versus 28%), bacteroides sp (17 versus 37%), or peptostreptococcus (31 versus 33%) (p greater  than .05 for each comparison). the proportion of semen samples yielding bacterial isolates was similar after categorization by normal motility (more than 60%), pyospermia (six or more leukocytes per 100 sperm), sperm concentration, morphology, and a normal sperm penetration assay (11% or more).(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == current taxonomy of medically important nonsporing anaerobes.
AB  == this review deals mainly with the taxonomy of the genera and species in the family bacteroidaceae. it has been proposed that the genus bacteroides should be  restricted to include the "bacteroides fragilis group" and that the asaccharolytic black-pigmented bacteroides species be transferred to a new genus, porphyromonas. new bacteroides, fusobacterium, and selenomonas species have been  described. a high degree of heterogeneity is apparently present among peptostreptococcus species. mobiluncus is a novel genus including gram-variable curved rods isolated from the human vagina. brachyspira has been proposed as the  generic name for spirochetes isolated from patients with intestinal spirochetosis.

TI  == chemotaxis inhibition by gardnerella vaginalis and succinate producing vaginal anaerobes: composition of vaginal discharge associated with g vaginalis.
AB  == the influence of six succinate producing vaginal anaerobes and gardnerella vaginalis on the chemotactic activity of granulocytes was studied by the under agarose method. g vaginalis, mobiluncus species, and three gram negative anaerobes elicited hardly any response, but peptostreptococcus productus showed clear positive chemotaxis, as did the escherichia coli strain used as a control.  inhibition of the chemotactic response of white blood cells was found with all strains, but the high succinate producers from the genus bacteroides showed the most pronounced effect. the inhibition of chemotaxis by succinate producing anaerobes in the pathogenesis of non-specific vaginitis (nsv) is postulated, and  b ureolyticus or mobiluncus spp, rather than g vaginalis, are suggested as possible causes of nsv.

AB  == 56 women who were diagnosed bioclinically as having a bacterial vaginal infection were studied, as were 35 women as a control group. the study was a semi-quantitative analysis of the vaginal bacterial flora, both aerobic and anaerobic. it shows that gardnerella vaginalis and anaerobic bacteria such as peptococcus, peptostreptococcus, bacteroides, veillonella and mobiluncus were associated in a statistically significant way with bacterial vaginitis. on the other hand lactobacilli were less frequently found (p less than 0.001) than in the control group of women. the way in which the microbial flora is changed has been observed during attacks of vaginitis and is discussed, as is the importance  of making the diagnosis and of treating this syndrome.
