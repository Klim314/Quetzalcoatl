TI  == the short-term treatment effects on the microbiota at the dorsum of the tongue in intra-oral halitosis patients--a randomized clinical trial.
AB  == objectives: this study aims to assess the effects of rinsing with zinc- and chlorhexidine-containing mouth rinse with or without adjunct tongue scraping on volatile sulfur compounds (vscs) in breath air, and the microbiota at the dorsum  of the tongue. material and methods: a randomized single-masked controlled clinical trial with a cross-over study design over 14 days including 21 subjects  was performed. bacterial samples from the dorsum of the tongue were assayed by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. results: no halitosis (identified by vsc assessments) at day 14 was identified in 12/21 subjects with active rinse alone,  in 10/21 with adjunct use of tongue scraper, in 1/21 for negative control rinse alone, and in 3/21 in the control and tongue scraping sequence. at day 14, significantly lower counts were identified only in the active rinse sequence (p < 0.001) for 15/78 species including, fusobacterium sp., porphyromonas gingivalis,  pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, and tannerella forsythia. a decrease in bacteria from baseline to day 14 was found in successfully treated subjects for 9/74 species including: p. gingivalis, prevotella melaninogenica, s. aureus, and treponema denticola. baseline vsc scores were correlated with several bacterial species. the use of a tongue scraper combined with active rinse did not change the levels of vsc compared to rinsing alone. conclusions: vsc scores were  not associated with bacterial counts in samples taken from the dorsum of the tongue. the active rinse alone containing zinc and chlorhexidine had effects on intra-oral halitosis and reduced bacterial counts of species associated with malodor. tongue scraping provided no beneficial effects on the microbiota studied. clinical relevance: periodontally healthy subjects with intra-oral halitosis benefit from daily rinsing with zinc- and chlorhexidine-containing mouth rinse.

TI  == botryomycosis presenting as nasal cutaneous fistulas caused by prevotella melaninogenica.
AB  == botryomycosis is an uncommon chronic suppurative granulomatous bacterial infection that can affect the skin and viscera. clinically, lesions typically consist of small tender nodules from which draining sinuses may develop to expel  a purulent discharge. histopathological features include characteristic aggregation of microorganisms (grain) within the inflammatory infiltrate. the commonest causative organisms are staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa, of others. botryomycosis resulting from prevotella melaninogenica has not been reported previously. we report the case of a middle-aged patient with botryomycosis presenting as nasal cutaneous fistulas caused by p. melaninogenica, which was successfully treated with surgical intervention combined with systemic  antibiotic treatment.

TI  == fluid-containing emphysematous bullae: a spectrum of illness.
AB  == fluid-containing emphysematous bullae are an under-reported complication of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. the roles of bronchoscopy in the work-up and of antibiotics in the treatment are undefined. this study reports the combined results from the analysis of 16 cases treated at the present authors' institution and 36 previously reported cases. the median age at presentation was  58 yrs and the median duration of follow-up was 60 weeks. a third of the patients were asymptomatic, while two-thirds presented with symptoms, including 10% who had evidence of a severe lung infection. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and bacteroides melaninogenicus were cultured from the bullae fluid in three symptomatic patients. sputum and blood cultures were uninformative. bronchoscopy, performed in two-thirds of the cases, added no diagnostic information. antibiotic treatment did not result in a more rapid resolution of the air fluid level. percutaneous drainage was safe and effective in four patients. in conclusion, patients with fluid-containing bullae present with a spectrum of illness. antibiotic treatment does not hasten radiographic resolution and bronchoscopy has no diagnostic or therapeutic role.

TI  == role of anaerobes in acute pelvic inflammatory disease.
AB  == pouch of douglas aspirates were collected from 50 women with history and examination suggestive of acute pelvic inflammatory disease (pid) and 20 healthy  women admitted for tubal ligation served as control. a total of 57 microorganisms were isolated from 37 patients out of 50 in study group. of 37 positive cultures  21(56.7%) were monomicrobial and 16(43.2%) were polymicrobial. most common symptom in study group was lower abdominal pain (90%), vaginal discharge (70%) and irregular bleeding (40%) and 30% patients had history of intrauterine contraceptive device (iucd) implantation. the predominant aerobic isolates were escherichia coli, coagulase negative staphylococcus (cons), staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae while common anaerobes were bacteroides fragilis, prevotella melaninogenica, fusobacterium nucleatum and peptostreptococcus spp. our study shows that cefotaxime, cefuroxime and gentamicin may be used for gram negative aerobic bacilli; cloxacillin, cephaloridine and erythromycin for aerobic gram positive cocci and amikacin and ceftazidime for pseudomonas aeruginosa. thus for optimum therapy of acute pid it is beneficial to keep in mind major conceptual changes and therapeutic realities that have influenced current understanding of acute pid and have affected the choice of therapy.

TI  == bacteriological study of paediatric and adult chronic suppurative otitis media.
AB  == chronic suppurative otitis media (csom) is one of the commonest illnesses in ent  practice which requires medical attention all the more in children of poor socio-economic status having in past inadequate treatment and negligent medical care. the present study was conducted to find out the various aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms associated with csom in paediatric and adult cases and their current antimicrobial susceptibility pattern as a guide to therapy. samples were collected from 109 clinically diagnosed cases of csom and processed according to standard protocols. out of 74 paediatric csom cases, 72 (97.2%) were bacterial culture positive while out of 35 adult csom cases, 28 (80%) were culture positive. bilateral csom was slightly more common in adults (25%) than paediatric (21.4%) age group. polymicrobial nature of csom was noted in both paediatric (70.8%) and adult (71.4%) cases while number of organisms isolated per lesion was slightly higher in adults (2.5) as compared to paediatric (1.95) cases. in paediatric csom, staphylococcus aureus was the commonest aerobic isolate while in adult csom, pseudomonas aeruginosa was the commonest one. among  anaerobes peptostreptococcus spp. was commonest in csom where as prevotella melaninogenica in adult csom. sensitivity of s. aureus to cefuroxime was 72.2% while that of gram negative bacilli was higher to cefotaxime (90 to 100%). among  anaerobes higher sensitivity was seen to metronidazole (98.6%), clindamycin (95.7%) and chloramphenicol (98.6%). in view of the polymicrobial etiology of csom, prompt appropriate antimicrobial therapy can effectively reverse the disease process thereby preventing longterm sequelae.

TI  == antibacterial activity of aqueous extracts of selected chewing sticks.
AB  == this aim of this study was to determine the antibacterial activity in extracts obtained from various nigerian chewing sticks. aqueous extracts from seventeen chewing sticks and the fruit of c. ferruginea, one fruit used in oral hygiene in  nigeria, were screened for antibacterial activity against type cultures of staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. eleven of the test extracts showed activity against at least two of these referenced organisms. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) of these eleven extracts against clinical isolates from orofacial infection were determined. all the extracts demonstrated activity against staphylococcal and streptococcal isolates. over half of the extracts were active against enterobacteriaceae and obligate anaerobic isolates, including prevotella melaninogenica, porphyromonas gigivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and peptostreptococcus prevotii. extracts of the vitellaria paradoxa root, bridellia  ferruginea stem and twigs, garcinia cola stem, terminalia glaucescens root, morinda lucida root, and cnestis ferruginea fruit showed appreciable activity against all classes of bacterial isolates. the extracts of these plants may serve as sources for chemotherapeutic agents for the management of orofacial infections.

TI  == susceptibility of some oral microorganisms to chlorhexidine and paramonochlorophenol.
AB  == since the use of antimicrobial agents is required in endodontic therapies, this study aimed at determining the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of chlorhexidine digluconate and paramonochlorophenol (pmc) against microorganisms commonly found in endodontic infections. both agents were tested by agar dilution tests against pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, candida albicans, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, prevotella denticola and prevotella melaninogenica. the mic of chlorhexidine ranged from 2.67 to 80.00 microg/ml, and the mic of pmc from 46.67 to 213.33 microg/ml. the highest mic value of pmc was detected for e. faecalis whereas e. coli was the most susceptible microorganism to this agent. the highest mic values of chlorhexidine  were observed for p. aeruginosa whereas e. coli and p. denticola were the most susceptible microorganisms to this agent. since the mic values observed are much  lower than the concentrations currently used in the endodontic therapy, it is suggested that both agents are effective in reducing the microbiota in the root canal.

TI  == [yearly changes in antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates between 1996 and 2001--ii. gram-negative bacteria].
AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2001 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems and carbapenems. a total of 3,245 strains in 32 species of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from january to december, and consisted of moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii, citrobacter koseri, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabillis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia spp. (p. alcalifaciens, p. rettgeri, p. stuartii), pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas putida, burkholderia cepacia, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, haemophilus influenzae, acinetobactor baumannii, acinetobactor lwoffii, bacteroides fragilis  group (b. fragilis, b. vulgatus, b. distasonis, b. ovatus, b. thetaiotaomicron),  and prevotella spp. (p. melaninogenica, p. intermedia, p. bivia, p. oralis, p. denticola). czop possessed stable antibacterial activities against m. (b.) catarrhalis, e. coli, c. freundii, c. koseri, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, e. aerogenes, e. cloacae, s. marcescens, p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris, m. morganii, providencia spp., p. aeruginosa, and a. lwoffii throughout 6 years. the mic90 of  czop against those strains were consistent with those obtained from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. on the other hand, the mic90 of czop against h. influenzae yearly obviously increased with approximately 64-time difference during the study period. the mic90 of cefpirome, cefepime, and flomoxef against h. influenzae also yearly tended to rise. the present results demonstrated that czop had maintained the antibacterial activity against almost gram-negative strains tested. however, the decrease in antibacterial activities of czop against b. cepacia, and h. influenzae was suggested.

TI  == [effect of a polyoxydonium immunoregulator on the biological properties of microorganisms].
AB  == the effect of the synthetic immunomodulator polyoxydonium (po) on some biological properties of pathogenic bacteria (shigella flexneri, salmonella enteritidis), opportunistic bacteria (klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, bacteroides fragilis, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, prevotella melaninogenica, propionibacterium propionicum, clostridium difficile) and fungi (candida albicans), isolated during enteric infections, enteric dysbiosis, pyoinflammatory diseases, was evaluated in a number of in vitro experiments. the study revealed that the recommended therapeutic concentration of po decreased antilysozyme activity (ala) and the anticomplement  activity in klebsiella, shigella, propionibacterium, clostridium, bacteroids, fungi of the genus candida, but increased ala in nonhemolytic escherichia. under  the action of po an increased sensitivity of the microorganisms under study to definite antibiotics of the lincosamide, fluoroquinolon, carbapenem and cephalosporin groups was noted. the data obtained in this study reveal one of the possible mechanisms of the corrective action of po on the microbiocenosis of the  intestine in dysbiosis, enteric infections and pyoinflammatory diseases.

TI  == quantitative bacterial cultures and beta-lactamase activity in chronic suppurative otitis media.
AB  == aspiration of the exudate through open perforation was performed in 54 children with chronic suppurative otitis media. eighty aerobic and 81 anaerobic isolates were recovered. aerobic bacteria only were involved in 20 patients (37%), and anaerobic organisms only in seven (13%). mixed aerobic and anaerobic isolates were recovered from 27 patients (50%). the most common bacteria isolated were anaerobic gram-positive cocci, bacteroides melaninogenicus group, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, and staphylococcus aureus. there were 45 beta-lactamase-producing bacteria (blpb), 30 aerobes, and 15 anaerobes recovered  from 38 patients (70%). beta-lactamase activity was detected in 30 of the 38 ear  aspirates (79%) that contained blpb. all but one of these organisms were in excess of 10(4) colony-forming units/ml. the detection of beta-lactamase activity in the ear aspirates provides evidence of the role of blpb in the failure of penicillin therapy to eradicate chronic ear infection.

TI  == the anaerobic and aerobic bacterial flora of leg ulcers in patients with sickle-cell disease.
AB  == leg ulcers in 26 patients with sickle-cell disease (scd) were studied bacteriologically over a period of 6 months. the average age of the patients was  20.92 years and the mean duration of the ulcers was 3.43 years. in order of frequency, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and bacteroides melaninogenicus were the predominant organisms. anaerobes were isolated from 14 (54%) of 26 patients and represent 21% of the total 77 isolates. the presence of  anaerobes correlated well with odorous ulcers. isolation of anaerobes from leg ulcers of patients with scd has added to knowledge of bacterial infection in scd.

TI  == pathogenicity of encapsulated bacteroides melaninogenicus group, b. oralis and b. ruminicola subsp. brevis in abscesses in mice.
AB  == the pathogenicity of 27 clinical isolates of the bacteroides melaninogenicus (bm) group and four clinical isolates of b. oralis and b. ruminicola subsp. brevis were investigated by inoculating them into mice and subsequently determining their ability to cause subcutaneous (sc) or intraperitoneal abscesses. only 11 isolates of bm group and one b. ruminicola induced abscesses in mice, and all were found to be heavily encapsulated on recovery from the abscesses (more than 50 per cent of the organisms were encapsulated). when the other 23 isolates, however, were injected sc in combination with either klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, staphylococcus  aureus or streptococcus pyogenes, abscesses were formed in 16 of the 23 combinations. the bacteroides spp. recovered from the mixed infection were heavily encapsulated. capsules also formed in bacteroides if the organisms were injected together with capsular material or formalin killed cells of k. pneumoniae or encapsulated bacteroides sp. once non-encapsulated or only slightly encapsulated strains acquired a capsule, they could induce abscesses on reinoculation into mice.

TI  == [the bacterial flora of preputial space].
AB  == the bacterial flora of the preputial space of 210 healthy males (43 children aged between 2 and 11 years, 137 males between 12 and 60 years and 30 men over 60 years) was determined by smears and cultueres from glans penis, sulcus coronarius and the adjacent prepuce. the results were grouped according to various criteria, e.g. glans covered or uncovered and age of males. differences in the distribution of germs could be found in relationship to age. in the case of an uncovered glans penis the presence of microbial flora corresponds to the grampositive saprophytic bacteria in areas rich in sebaceous glands. in the case of a covered glans the density of microorganisms increases. prevalent are gramnegative anaerobes, especially bacterioides melaninogenicus, also enterococci, enterobacteria and coagulase-positive staphylococci.

TI  == anaerobic isolates in chronic recurrent suppurative otitis media. treatment with  carbenicillin alone and in combination with gentamicin.
AB  == tympanocentesis was performed in 32 pediatric patients with chronic recurrent suppurative otitis media. the aspirate was cultured aerobically and anaerobically. aerobes were isolated from ten patients (31.2%); anaerobes from one patient; and both aerobes and anaerobes from 21 patients (65.6%). there were  46 aerobic isolates. the aerobes commonly recovered were pseudomonas aeruginosa (24 isolates) proteus sp. (5) and staphylococcus aureus (3). there were 32 anaerobes isolated including anaerobic gram-positive cocci (19 isolates) and bacteroides sp., the latter of which included bacteroides fragilis group and bacteroides melaninogenicus (9). the patients were treated by parenteral carbenicillin 300 to 400 mg per kg per day given in four dosages administered for a period of 12 to 21 days (average 17 days). an aminoglycoside (gentamicin) was added in 15 patients. the clinical response was good in 17 patients and poor in 15. there were no side effects or adverse reactions noted during therapy. the above findings demonstrate the polymicrobial etiology of chronic recurrent suppurative otitis media and suggest that treatment directed against the aerobic  and anaerobic isolates is efficacious in more than half of the cases.

TI  == survival of anaerobic and aerobic bacteria on cotton swabs in three transport systems.
AB  == the capacity of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria to survive on cotton swabs placed  into a dry gassed-out co2-filled tube (dgt), dry sterile aerobic tube (dat), and  a tube containing a modified stuarts' transport medium (mst), was assessed. pseudomonas aeruginosa increased in numbers by 2 and 3 logs when stored in mst and dat, respectively. the viability of p. aeruginosa, although retarded when compared to msa and dat, was not adversely affected by the co2 environment in the dgt. the mst maintained relatively constant numbers of streptococcus pyogenes during the 48-h storage period. the dat and the dgt were unable to maintain the viability of s. pyogenes. staphylococcus aureus, when stored in a dgt, dat, or mst, was maintained in relatively constant numbers throughout the entire storage  period. of the four anaerobic bacteria evaluated (bacteroides fragilis ssp. thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides melaninogenicus ssp. asaccharolyticus, fusobacterium nucleatum, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius), only b. fragilis ssp. thetaiotamicron survived the 48-h storage period in the dgt. under these test conditions the dgt did not adequately maintain the viability of the majority of anaerobic bacteria tested (when held on cotton swabs). however, the mst did maintain the viability of all species tested for at least the first 2 h of storage.
