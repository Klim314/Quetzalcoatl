TI  == characterization of the cellulolytic bacteria communities along the gastrointestinal tract of chinese mongolian sheep by using pcr-dgge and real-time pcr analysis.
AB  == a balanced gastrointestinal microbial ecosystem is crucial for the health and growth of animals. in the gastrointestinal tract (git) of ruminants, cellulolytic bacteria aid in the digestion and absorption of nutrients. rumen contents and feces in ruminants are often used to assess gastrointestinal microbial communities; however, these sites do not guarantee to represent the diversity of  microbes found in the entire git. in this study, we investigated the microbiota along the git of five chinese mongolian sheep using pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) and real-time pcr analysis. results indicated that microbiota were more abundant in the stomach and large intestine than in the small intestine. dgge and real-time pcr revealed the predominance of firmicutes and bacteroidetes in the git. meanwhile, ruminococcus flavefaciens and clostridium cluster iv showed significant difference in their abundance along the git (p < 0.05). fibrobacter succinogenes was the most dominant species, followed  by ruminococcus albus and r. flavefaciens. the ileum harbored a larger number of  cellulolytic bacteria, particularly-clostridium cluster iv, than reported previously. in addition, comparisons between microbiota in the rumen and rectum indicated similar number of total bacteria, firmicutes, bacteroidetes, f. succinogenes, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, clostridium cluster iv, and clostridium  cluster xiva, whereas the number of r. albus and r. flavefaciens was higher in the rumen. this study investigated the composition and quantification of git microbial community in chinese mongolian sheep, and revealed for the first time the cellulolytic bacterial community in these sheep.

TI  == effect of dietary supplementation with resveratrol on nutrient digestibility, methanogenesis and ruminal microbial flora in sheep.
AB  == two experiments were conducted to evaluate the effect of resveratrol on methanogenesis and microbial flora in dorper x thin-tailed han cross-bred ewes. in experiment 1, ten ewes (67.2 +/- 2.24 kg bw) were assigned to two dietary treatments, a basal diet and a basal diet supplemented with resveratrol (0.25 g/head.day), to investigate the effect of resveratrol on nutrient digestibility and nitrogen balance. in experiment 2, six ewes (64.0 +/- 1.85 kg bw) with ruminal cannulae were assigned to the identical dietary treatments used in experiment 1 to investigate supplementary resveratrol on ruminal fermentation and microbial flora using qpcr. the results showed that supplementary resveratrol improved the digestibility of organic matter (om; p < 0.001), nitrogen (n; p = 0.007), neutral detergent fibre (ndf; p < 0.001) and acid detergent fibre (adf; p < 0.001). the excretion of faecal n was reduced (p = 0.007), whereas that of urinary n increased (p = 0.002), which led to an unchanged n retention (p = 0.157). both co2 and ch4 output scaled to digestible dry matter (dm) intake decreased from 602.5 to 518.7 (p = 0.039) and 68.2 to 56.6 (p < 0.001) respectively. ruminal ph (p = 0.341), ammonia (p = 0.512) and total volatile fatty acid (vfa) (p = 0.249) were unaffected by resveratrol. the molar proportion of propionate increased from 13.1 to 17.5% (p < 0.001) while that of butyrate decreased from 11.0 to 9.55% (p < 0.001). the ratio of acetate to propionate (a/p) decreased from 5.44 to 3.96 (p < 0.001). supplementary resveratrol increased ruminal population of fibrobacter succinogenes, ruminococcus albus and  butyrivibrio fibrisolvens (p < 0.001) while decreased protozoa and methanogens. in conclusion, dietary resveratrol inhibited methanogenesis without adversely affecting ruminal fermentation.

TI  == effects of isobutyrate supplementation on ruminal microflora, rumen enzyme activities and methane emissions in simmental steers.
AB  == the objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of isobutyrate supplementation on rumen microflora, enzyme activities and methane emissions in simmental steers consuming a corn stover-based diet. eight ruminally cannulated simmental steers were used in a replicated 4 x 4 latin square experiment. the treatments were control (without isobutyrate), low isobutyrate (lib), moderate isobutyrate (mib) and high isobutyrate (hib) with 8.4, 16.8 and 25.2 g isobutyrate per steer per day respectively. isobutyrate was hand-mixed into the concentrate portion. diet consisted of 60% corn stover and 40% concentrate [dry matter (dm) basis]. dry matter intake (averaged 9 kg/day) was restricted to a maximum of 90% of ad libitum intake. population of total bacteria, cellulolytic bacteria and anaerobic fungi were linearly increased, whereas that of protozoa and total methanogens was linearly reduced with increasing isobutyrate supplementation. real-time pcr quantification of population of ruminococcus albus, ruminococcus flavefaciens, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens and fibrobacter succinogenes was linearly increased with increasing isobutyrate supplementation.  activities of carboxymethyl cellulase, xylanase and beta-glucosidase were linearly increased, whereas that of protease was linearly reduced. methane production was linearly decreased with increasing isobutyrate supplementation. effective degradabilities of cellulose and hemicellulose of corn stover were linearly increased, whereas that of crude protein in diet was linearly decreased  with increasing isobutyrate supplementation. the present results indicate that isobutyrate supplemented improved microflora, rumen enzyme activities and methane emissions in steers. it was suggested that the isobutyrate stimulated the digestive micro-organisms or enzymes in a dose-dependent manner. in the experimental conditions of this trial, the optimum isobutyrate dose was approximately 16.8 g isobutyrate per steer per day.

TI  == determination of bacteria constituting ruminal fibrolytic consortia developed on  orchard grass hay stem.
AB  == to determine the relationship between fibrobacter succinogenes and other rumen bacteria, the bacterial community structure on fiber was analyzed by using two different materials. these were ruminally incubated orchard grass hay stems without and with preincubation with f. succinogenes (natural and artificial consortia, respectively). the natural consortium mainly consisted of firmicutes (56.6%) and bacteroidetes (33.1%), while the artificial consortium showed a significantly higher proportion of firmicutes (85.5%) and a lower proportion of bacteroidetes (4.6%). at species or genus level, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, the u2 group, ruminococcus albus and lachnospiraceae incertae sedis made up a higher  proportion in the artificial consortium. the most dominant bacterial group was the butyrivibrio-pseudobutyrivibrio-lachnospiraceae incertae sedis group, which accounted for 19.7% in the natural and 29.5% in the artificial consortium. within the genus butyrivibrio, the phylogenetic groups sa and va2 and phylogeny-undefined butyribivrio, but not va1, were detected at high frequency in the artificial consortium. these results suggest that ecological and possibly functional relationships exist in the rumen among f. succinogenes, a subset of b. fibrisolvens, the u2 group, r. albus and lachnospiraceae incertae sedis.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of brazilian propolis extracts against rumen bacteria in vitro.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of three brazilian propolis extracts was evaluated on  bacterial strains representing major rumen functional groups. the extracts were prepared using different concentrations of propolis and alcohol, resulting in different phenolic compositions. the propolis extracts inhibited the growth of fibrobacter succinogenes s85, ruminococcus flavefaciens fd-1, ruminococcus albus  7, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens d1, prevotella albensis m384, peptostreptococcus sp. d1, clostridium aminophilum f and streptococcus bovis pearl11, while r. albus 20, prevotella bryantii b(1)4 and ruminobacter amylophilus h18 were resistant to all  the extracts. the inhibited strains showed also different sensitivity to propolis; the hyper-ammonia-producing bacteria (c. aminophilum f and peptostreptococcus sp. d1) being the most sensitive. inhibition of hyper-ammonia-producing bacteria by propolis would be beneficial to the animal. the extract containing the lowest amount of phenolic compounds (llos c3) showed the lowest antimicrobial activity against all the bacteria. the major phenolic compounds identified in the propolis extracts (naringenin, chrysin, caffeic acid, p-coumaric acid and artepillin c) were also evaluated on four sensitive strains.  only naringenin showed inhibitory effect against all strains, suggesting that naringenin is one of the components participating to the antibacterial activity of propolis.

TI  == microbial ecosystem and fermentation traits in the caecum of growing rabbits given diets varying in neutral detergent soluble and insoluble fibre levels.
AB  == the effect of the level of neutral detergent fibre (ndf: 0.35, li and 0.42, hi) and neutral detergent soluble fibre (ndsf: 0.14, ls and 0.17, hs) in the caecal ecosystem was studied in 24 weaned (28 days of age) rabbits, weighing 630 +/- 80.2 g in a 2 x 2 factorial design. after 22 days, rabbits were slaughtered and their caecal contents sampled. the caecal ph (on average 6.2) and molar volatile  fatty acids (vfa) proportions were not affected by dietary treatments, but total  vfa concentration tended to be lower with ndf (84.7 vs. 74.1 mmol/l; p = 0.095).  the amount of total bacteria tended (p = 0.075) to increase with ndsf, but only in diets with 0.35 ndf. the caecal proportions of ruminococcus albus and fibrobacter succinogenes were not affected by type or level of fibre, but butyrivibrio fibrisolvens decreased (p = 0.055) with the ndf proportion in ls diets. denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) analysis showed that bacterial communities clustered according to each combination of ndf and ndsf, but did not greatly differ among diets (similarity indexes between 0.67 and 0.70), nor biodiversity was affected (average shannon and richness indexes 3.50 and 33.1; p > 0.10). archaeal population revealed changes in the amount and composition that were particularly evident in hs diets, decreasing in concentration (from 4.37 to 4.12 log10 gene copy number/g) and biodiversity (shannon index from 3.14 to 2.52 and richness index from 23.7 to 13.9) compared to ls. the type and level of dietary fibre had a minor impact on caecal fermentation traits or caecal bacterial community. however, the increase in ndsf  from 0.14 to 0.17 reduced concentration and diversity of methanogenic archaea.

TI  == characterisation of caecal microbial diversity of lactating does and their offspring given diets with different neutral detergent soluble to insoluble fibre ratios.
AB  == the effect of neutral detergent soluble fibre (ndsf) to neutral detergent fibre (ndf) dietary ratio (0.29, lr and 0.43, hr) on the caecal ecosystem of lactating  does and their offspring was studied. from the 17th day of lactation, each diet was given to four does, allowing for free access to their litters. does were sampled at 17 and 28 days of lactation, and also two pups per litter at 17 (milk-fed only), 28 (milk and solid fed) and 49 days of age. dgge was used to study bacterial caecal biodiversity, and total bacterial concentration and relative proportions of ruminococcus albus and butyrivibrio fibrisolvens were quantified by real time pcr. in does, diet did not affect (p > 0.10) diversity indexes, total bacterial concentration or relative abundance of b. fibrisolvens,  but at 28 days of lactation the proportion of r. albus was higher with lr (interaction diet x time, p = 0.037). caecal communities of pups of 17 days were  grouped by litter, but the influence of the mother was reduced at 28 days with solid feed intake, and at 49 days rabbits clustered by diet. caecal biodiversity  increased from 17 to 28 days, and was reduced at 49 days (shannon index of 3.60,  3.71 and 3.57, respectively; p = 0.049). total bacterial concentration and relative abundance of r. albus and b. fibrisolvens increased with solid feed intake from 17 to 28 days (p < 0.01), remaining unaffected thereafter. access of  pups to solid feed from 17 days of age modulates the development and composition  of the caecal microbiota at weaning.

TI  == effects of disodium fumarate on ruminal fermentation and microbial communities in sheep fed on high-forage diets.
AB  == this study was conducted to investigate effects of disodium fumarate (df) on fermentation characteristics and microbial populations in the rumen of hu sheep fed on high-forage diets. two complementary feeding trials were conducted. in trial 1, six hu sheep fitted with ruminal cannulae were randomly allocated to a 2 x 2 cross-over design involving dietary treatments of either 0 or 20 g df daily.  total dna was extracted from the fluid- and solid-associated rumen microbes, respectively. numbers of 16s rdna gene copies associated with rumen methanogens and bacteria, and 18s rdna gene copies associated with rumen protozoa and fungi were measured using real-time pcr, and expressed as proportion of total rumen bacteria 16s rdna. ruminal ph decreased in the df group compared with the control (p < 0.05). total volatile fatty acids increased (p < 0.001), but butyrate decreased (p < 0.01). addition of df inhibited the growth of methanogens, protozoa, fungi and ruminococcus flavefaciens in fluid samples. both ruminococcus albus and butyrivibrio fibrisolvens populations increased (p < 0.001) in particle-associated samples. trial 2 was conducted to investigate the adaptive response of rumen microbes to df. three cannulated sheep were fed on basal diet for 2 weeks and continuously for 4 weeks with supplementation of df at a level of 20 g/day. ruminal samples were collected every week to analyze fermentation parameters and microbial populations. no effects of df were observed on ph, acetate and butyrate (p > 0.05). populations of methanogens and r. flavefaciens decreased in the fluid samples (p < 0.001), whereas addition of df stimulated the population of solid-associated fibrobacter succinogenes. population of r. albus increased in the 2nd to 4th week in fluid-associated samples and was threefold higher in the 4th week than control week in solid samples. analysis of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis fingerprints revealed that there were significant changes in rumen microbiota after adding df. ten of 15 clone sequences from cut-out bands appearing in both the 2nd and the 4th week were 94% to 100% similar to prevotella-like bacteria, and four sequences showed 95% to 98% similarity to selenomonas dianae. another 15 sequences were obtained from bands, which appeared in the 4th week only. thirteen of these 15 sequences showed 95% to 99% similarity to clostridium sp., and the other two showed 95% and 100% similarity to ruminococcus sp. in summary, the microorganisms positively responding to df addition were the cellulolytic bacteria, r. albus, f. succinogenes and b. fibrisolvens as well as proteolytic bacteria, b. fibrisolvens, p. ruminicola and  clostridium sp.

TI  == molecular diversity of bacteria in yunnan yellow cattle (bos taurs) from nujiang  region, china.
AB  == the rumen content of four yunnan yellow cattle (bos taurs) were collected to determine the bacteria diversity by using 16s rrna gene sequence analysis. a total of 129 sequences were examined and the sequences were referred as 107 otu (operational taxonomy unit) according to the similarity level of 97% in gene sequence. similarity analysis revealed that yunnan yellow cattle had 12 sequences (10 otu) shared 97% or greater similarity with cultured rumen bacteria butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, succiniclasticum ruminis, ruminococcus bromii, clostridium proteoclasticum, ruminococcus flavefaciens, pseudobutyrivibrio ruminis, jeotgalicoccus psychrophilus, and prevotella ruminicola, which accounting for 9.3% of the total clones (9.2% of the total otu). the further 12 sequences (9 otu) shared 90-97% similarity with cultured bacteria clostridium aminobutyricum, butyrate-producing bacterium, schwartzia succinivorans, prevotella ruminicola, eubacterium ruminantium, ruminococcus albus, and clostridium termitidis, also accounting for 9.3% of the total sequences (8.3% of  the total otu). the remaining 105 sequences (90 otu) shared less than 90% similarity with cultured bacteria, accounting for 81.4% of the total sequences (82.5% of the total otu). according to the phylogenetic analysis, all sequences were phylogenetically placed within phyla of low g+c subdivision (accounting for  72.1 and 72.5% of the total clones and otu, respectively) and cfb subdivision (cytophaga-flexibacter-bacteroides; accounting for 27.9 and 27.5% of the total clones and otu, respectively). among the examined clones, rare bacteria jeotgalicoccus psychrophilus was detected in the rumen of cattle.

TI  == the effect of lipid supplements on ruminal bacteria in continuous culture fermenters varies with the fatty acid composition.
AB  == a single flow continuous culture fermenter system was used in this study to investigate the influence of dietary lipid supplements varying in their fatty acid content on the dna concentration of selected rumen bacteria. four continuous culture fermenters were used in a 4 x 4 latin square design with four periods of  10 d each. treatment diets were fed at 45 g/d (dm basis) in three equal portions  during the day. the diets were: 1) control (con), 2) control with animal fat source (sat), 3) control with soybean oil (sbo), and 4) control with fish oil (fo). lipid supplements were added at 3% of diet dm. the concentrations of total  volatile fatty acids and acetate were not affected (p>0.05) by lipid supplements. concentrations of propionate, iso-butyrate, valerate and iso-valerate were highest (p<0.05) with the fo diet compared with the other treatment diets. the concentration of til c18:l (vaccenic acid, va) in effluents increased (p<0.05) with sbo and fo diets and was highest with the sbo diet. the concentrations of c18:0 in effluents were lowest (p<0.05) for the fo diet compared with the other treatment diets. concentrations of dna for anaerovibrio lipolytica, and butyrivibrio proteoclasticus in fermenters were similar (p>0.05) for all diets. the dna concentrations of butyrivibrio fibrisolvens and ruminococcus albus in fermenters were lowest (p<0.05) with the fo diet but were similar (p>0.05) among  the other treatment diets. selenomonas ruminantium dna concentration in fermenters was highest (p<0.05) with the fo diet. in conclusion, sbo had no effect on bacterial dna concentrations tested in this study and the va accumulation in the rumen observed on the fo diet may be due in part to fo influence on b. fibrisolvens, r. albus, and s. ruminantium.

TI  == effect of incremental levels of fish oil supplementation on specific bacterial populations in bovine ruminal fluid.
AB  == the objective of this study was to determine the effects of incremental replacement of dietary linoleic acid by >20-carbon polyunsaturated fatty acids (pufa) on changes in population of ruminal micro-organisms associated with fibre  digestion and biohydrogenation using real-time pcr of bacterial 16s rrna sequences. four beef steers with ruminal cannulas were randomly assigned to control (ck, 65:35 forage to concentrate), ck with 3% sunflower oil plus 1% fish  oil (s3f1), 2.5% sunflower oil plus 1.5% fish oil (s2.5f1.5) or 2% sunflower oil  plus 2% fish oil (s2f2) in a 4 x 4 latin square design with 21-day periods. ruminal fluid was collected on day 15 of each period. compared with ck, oil addition led to lower ruminal acetate and butyrate but greater propionate concentration. dna copy number of anaerovibrio lipolytica in ruminal fluid was greater with oil (average 5.38 vs. 3.62 x 10(5) dna copy number), particularly with s2f2 relative to ck. fibrobacter succinogenes and butyrivibrio fibrisolvens  dna copy number decreased by 74% (1.06 vs. 4.01 x 10(5)) and 39% (5.16 vs. 8.42 x 10(7)) in response to s2f2 compared with ck. dna copy numbers of ruminococcus flavefaciens and ruminococcus albus were not affected by incremental fish oil. results suggest that greater availability of pufa with >20 carbons (i.e. eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid) promoted changes in bacterial populations that are relevant for fibre digestion and biohydrogenation.

TI  == the effect of replacing corn with glycerol on ruminal bacteria in continuous culture fermenters.
AB  == the effects of substituting corn with glycerol on dna concentration of selected ruminal bacteria were investigated using continuous fermenters. four continuous culture fermenters were used in a 4 x 4 latin square design with four 10 days consecutive periods. treatment diets (60:40 forage to concentrate) were fed at 45 g/day dry matter (dm) in three equal portions. glycerol (0.995 g/g glycerol) was  used to replace corn in a grain mix at proportions of 0% (t0; control), 15% (t15), 30% (t30) and 45% (t45). on day 10 of each period, samples were collected  from each fermenter 3 h after the morning feeding and analysed for volatile fatty acid and bacterial dna concentration. glycerol substitution was related to significantly higher butyrate, valerate and isovalerate concentrations. compared  with the t0 diet, acetate concentration was significantly lower with the t30 and  t45 diets whilst propionate concentration was higher only with the t45 diet. the  dna concentrations for butyrivibrio fibrisolvens and selenomonas ruminantium decreased with the t30 and t45 diets compared with the t0 diet. no differences in the dna concentrations for ruminococcus albus and succinivibrio dextrinosolvens amongst diets were observed. the findings show that substituting 15% of the dietary corn with glycerol had no substantive effects on fermentation processing  or ruminal bacteria. higher substitution levels, however, may adversely affect ruminal bacteria and negatively impact acetate production.

TI  == detection and identification of rumen bacteria constituting a fibrolytic consortium dominated by fibrobacter succinogenes.
AB  == a fibrolytic consortium, dominated by the rumen cellulolytic bacterium fibrobacter succinogenes, was artificially constructed on hay stems to detect and identify rumen bacteria that can potentially interact with f. succinogenes. consortium-bacterial members were determined by dgge and sequencing analysis targeted bacterial 16s rdna. an artificial consortium was formed in a 2-step incubation of hay stems; the first step with group 1, 2 or 3 f. succinogenes strains, the second step with rumen fluid. after consortium formation, morphologically different bacteria were observed in association with f. succinogenes. dgge exhibited more than 30 bands, the pattern of which depended on the f. succinogenes group. sequencing suggested that butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, pseudobutyrivibrio ruminis, clostridium sp., f. succinogenes group 2, prevotella  ruminicola and unclassified bacteroides were prominent in the group 1 consortium  and that treponema bryantii, b. fibrisolvens, acinetobacter sp, and wolinella succinogenes were prominent in the group 2 consortium. however, in the group 3 consortium, f. succinogenes-like bacteria were microscopically undetectable, whereas cellulolytic ruminococcus albus and f. succinogenes group 1 were prominent, suggesting that the group 3 cannot be a core member of this consortium. this study is the first attempt to identify bacterial members of a fibrolytic consortium dominated by a specific bacterium.

TI  == soybean oil and linseed oil supplementation affect profiles of ruminal microorganisms in dairy cows.
AB  == the objective of this study was to evaluate changes in ruminal microorganisms and fermentation parameters due to dietary supplementation of soybean and linseed oil alone or in combination. four dietary treatments were tested in a latin square designed experiment using four primiparous rumen-cannulated dairy cows. treatments were control (c, 60 : 40 forage to concentrate) or c with 4% soybean oil (s), 4% linseed oil (l) or 2% soybean oil plus 2% linseed oil (sl) in a 4 x 4 latin square with four periods of 21 days. forage and concentrate mixtures were fed at 0800 and 2000 h daily. ruminal fluid was collected every 2 h over a 12-h period on day 19 of each experimental period and ph was measured immediately. samples were prepared for analyses of concentrations of volatile fatty acids (vfa) by glc and ammonia. counts of total and individual bacterial groups (cellulolytic, proteolytic, amylolytic bacteria and total viable bacteria) were performed using the roll-tube technique, and protozoa counts were measured via microscopy in ruminal fluid collected at 0, 4 and 8 h after the morning feeding.  content of ruminal digesta was obtained via the rumen cannula before the morning  feeding and used immediately for dna extraction and quantity of specific bacterial species was obtained using real- time pcr. ruminal ph did not differ but total vfa (110 v. 105 mmol/l) were lower (p < 0.05) with oil supplementation  compared with c. concentration of ruminal nh3-n (4.4 v. 5.6 mmol/l) was greater (p < 0.05) due to oil compared with c. compared with c, oil supplementation resulted in lower (p < 0.05) cellulolytic bacteria (3.25 x 108 v. 4.66 x 108 colony-forming units (cfu)/ml) and protozoa (9.04 x 104 v. 12.92 x 104 cell/ml) colony counts. proteolytic bacteria (7.01 x 108 v. 6.08 x 108 cfu/ml) counts, however, were greater in response to oil compared with c (p < 0.05). among oil treatments, the amount of butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, fibrobacter succinogenes and ruminococcus flavefaciens in ruminal fluid was substantially lower (p < 0.05) when l was included. compared to c, the amount of ruminococcus albus decreased by an average of 40% regardless of oil level or type. overall, the results indicate  that some ruminal microorganisms, except proteolytic bacteria, are highly susceptible to dietary unsaturated fatty acids supplementation, particularly when linolenic acid rich oils were fed. dietary oil effects on ruminal fermentation parameters seemed associated with the profile of ruminal microorganisms.

TI  == biotransformation of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene by pure culture ruminal bacteria.
AB  == twenty-one ruminal bacteria species were tested for their ability to degrade 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (tnt) within 24 h. butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, fibrobacter succinogenes, lactobacillus vitulinus, selenomonas ruminantium, streptococcus caprinus, and succinivibrio dextrinosolvens were able to completely degrade 100 mg/l tnt, with <5% of the original tnt recovered as diaminonitrotoluene metabolites. eubacterium ruminantium, lactobacillus ruminis, ruminobacter amylophilus, streptococcus bovis, and wolinella succinogenes were able to completely degrade 100 mg/l tnt, with 23-60% of the tnt recovered as aminodinitrotoluene and/or diaminonitrotoluene metabolites. clostridium polysaccharolyticum, megasphaera elsdenii, prevotella bryantii, prevotella ruminicola, ruminococcus albus, and ruminococcus flavefaciens were able to degrade 80-90% of 100 mg/l tnt. desulfovibrio desulfuricans subsp. desulfuricans, prevotella albensis, and treponema bryantii degraded 50-80% of the tnt. anaerovibrio lipolytica was completely inhibited by 100 mg/l tnt. these results indicate that a variety of rumen bacteria is capable of transforming tnt.

TI  == dominance of prevotella and low abundance of classical ruminal bacterial species  in the bovine rumen revealed by relative quantification real-time pcr.
AB  == relative quantification real-time pcr was used to quantify several bacterial species in ruminal samples from two lactating cows, each sampled 3 h after feeding on two successive days. abundance of each target taxon was calculated as  a fraction of the total 16s rrna gene copies in the samples, using taxon-specific and eubacterial domain-level primers. bacterial populations showed a clear predominance of members of the genus prevotella, which comprised 42% to 60% of the bacterial rrna gene copies in the samples. however, only 2% to 4% of the bacterial rrna gene copies were represented by the classical ruminal prevotella species prevotella bryantii, prevotella ruminicola and prevotella brevis. the proportion of rrna gene copies attributable to fibrobacter succinogenes, ruminococcus flavefaciens, selenomonas ruminantium and succinivibrio dextrinosolvens were each generally in the 0.5% to 1% range. proportions for ruminobacter amylophilus and eubacterium ruminantium were lower (0.1% to 0.2%), while butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, streptococcus bovis, ruminococcus albus and megasphaera elsdenii were even less abundant, each comprising <0.03% of the bacterial rrna gene copies. the data suggest that the aggregate abundance of the  most intensively studied ruminal bacterial species is relatively low and that a large fraction of the uncultured population represents a single bacterial genus.

AB  == high concentrations of hydroxycinnamic acids in the hemicellulosic fraction of dry season tropical grasses may influence the rate of microbial degradation of arabinoxylans by ruminant animals. the ability of 22 strains of butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, other ruminal bacteria (ruminococcus albus sy3, ruminococcus flavefaciens rf1,prevotella ruminicola ar20) and the ruminal phycomycete neocallimastix patriciarum cx to digest the tropical grass heteropogon contortus(spear grass) and hydrolyse esterified ferulic and p-coumaric acid was examined. significant digestion (8-36%) of spear grass occurred with the b. fibrisolvens strains h17c, a38, lp92-1-1, 49,r. albus sy3 and n. patriciarum. hydrolysis of ester-linked ferulic and p-coumaric acid occurred with all organisms except b. fibrisolvens strains gs113, ob156 and lp1028 and p. ruminicola ar20. the ratio of ferulic to p-coumaric acid hydrolysed by different  strains of butyrivibrio spp. varied markedly from 0.96 for ar 51 to 0.16 for a38. butyrivibrios which were fibrolytic (h17c and a38) had higher extracellular cinnamoyl esterase activity than bacteria that did not digest spear grass fibre (lp 91-4-1 and ar 20) which had low activities or only produced cell associated enzyme. cell associated and extracellular esterase activity were induced when butyrivibrio spp. strains h17c, a38 and e14 and the ruminococcus spp. were grown  on birchwood xylan but induction did not occur to the same extent with n. patriciarum. this is the first reported observation of cinnamoyl esterase activity in the genus ruminococcus. the fungus n. patriciarum had significantly higher digestibility of spear grass and solubilisation of phenolic acids than the bacteria. the study shows that high levels of extracellular cinnamoyl esterases are characteristic of a selection of fibre-degrading ruminal bacteria and fungi which probably indicates that these enzymes are common amongst xylanolytic ruminal microorganisms.

TI  == assessment of biases associated with profiling simple, model communities using terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism-based analyses.
AB  == community profiles based on terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism (t-rflp) analyses of amplified ribosomal rna genes are used to monitor changes in microbial community structure and are sometimes employed for semi-quantitative estimates of species richness and abundance in environmental samples. to assess the accuracy of t-rflp community profiles representing the relative abundance of  bacteria in a sample, five species of ruminal bacteria were used to construct simple "communities". template dna for pcr amplification was generated either by  mixing equal quantities of genomic dna from pure cultures or by mixing equal numbers of cells prior to dna extraction. pairwise mixtures of fibrobacter succinogenes s85 with ruminococcus albus 8, ruminococcus flavefaciens fd-1, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens 49 and streptococcus bovis jb1 were created and a 5-member community was constructed. with genomic dna mixes, relative abundance calculations based on t-rflp patterns did not reflect input ratios. these discrepancies could not be accounted for by differences in genome size and rrna operon copy number. in cell mixing experiments, easily lysed cells were overrepresented. to determine if a numerical correction factor could be used to compensate for observed discrepancies, we attempted to quantify biases attributed to dna extraction and pcr amplification. biases attributable to these factors led to deviations from expected pcr product ratios by 6% to 38%. we found that interactions were so complex that a suitable factor could not be derived. the unsystematic dependence of t-rflp peak ratios on variability of dna extraction and pcr amplification prevents accurate quantification of the relative abundance  of microorganisms designed to represent simplified natural populations.

TI  == variation in antimicrobial action of proanthocyanidins from dorycnium rectum against rumen bacteria.
AB  == the proanthocyanidin polymer fractions of the leaves of the forage legume dorycnium rectum were analysed by acid catalysis with benzyl mercaptan, nmr and es-ms. the results showed that d. rectum differs from other temperate proanthocyanidin-containing forage legumes in that the range of polymers extends  up to very high degrees of polymerisation. three fractions were characterised as  low, medium, and high molecular weight proanthocyanidin fractions with mean degree of polymerisations of 10.3, 41 and 127, respectively. epigallocatechin was the most abundant extension unit and the terminating flavan-3-ols comprised largely catechin and gallocatechin units in equal proportions. formation of thiolyated dimer products showed the interflavan-linkages of the lower molecular  weight proanthocyanidins to be predominantly c4-->c8 with a small amount of c4-->c6. es-ms spectra distinguished lower from higher polymeric proanthocyanidins from m2- to m8(2)-. the antibacterial activity of proanthocyanidin fractions against pure cultures of microbes selected from the ruminal population to represent fibre degrading, proteolytic and hyper ammonia producing bacteria in broth culture was evaluated. the activity of proanthocyanidin fractions against clostridium aminophilum, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens and clostridium proteoclasticum was significantly dependent on their structure but not so against ruminococcus albus and peptostreptococcus anaerobius. the latter observation was unique in that they were sensitive to all  proanthocyanidin fractions evaluated, even at the lowest concentration (100 microg/ml). the results suggest the effects of the extractable proanthocyanidins  on rumen microbes should be considered when evaluating an alternative proanthocyanidin-containing forage source for ruminants, such as d. rectum.

TI  == expression and export of a ruminococcus albus cellulase in butyrivibrio fibrisolvens through the use of an alternative gene promoter and signal sequence.
AB  == ruminococcal cellulase (ruminococcus albus f-40 endoglucanase egi) was successfully expressed in butyrivibrio fibrisolvens ob156c, using the erm promoter from pambeta1. a newly identified signal peptide coding region of xyna from b. fibrisolvens 49 allowed efficient translocation of the foreign egi into the extracellular fraction. first, b. fibrisolvens xyna with or without its own putative signal peptide (xyna sp) coding region was cloned into a shuttle vector  to transform b. fibrisolvens ob156c. both plasmids caused a 2- to 2.4-fold increase in xylanase activity. the transformant expressing xyna with the signal peptide showed a significantly higher proportion of activity in the extracellular fraction than the transformant with xyna lacking the signal peptide (75% vs. 19%), demonstrating the significance of xyna sp in the translocation of the expressed enzyme. second, using the xyna sp coding region, secretion of egi was attempted in b. fibrisolvens. since the signal peptide of r. albus egi did not function in b. fibrisolvens, it was replaced with the xyna sp. a high activity variant of egi containing the xyna sp was transcribed using the erm promoter, resulting in a 27-fold increase in endoglucanase activity, most of which (>93%) was in the extracellular fraction of the b. fibrisolvens transformant. egi without the xyna sp was scarcely detected in the extracellular fraction (<10%).

TI  == feasibility of using total purines as a marker for ruminal bacteria.
AB  == a procedure for measuring total purine content of mixed ruminal bacteria was adapted for use in the determination of purines in pure cultures of ruminal bacteria. recovery of adenine and guanine, alone or in mixture, was quite variable. the problem was traced to solubility of the silver salt of adenine in the acid wash solution. when the precipitating solution was used as the wash, recovery of the purines was over 97%. recovery of a 1:1 mixture of adenine and guanine added to yeast rna was 100.6+/-3.2%. purine, protein, and bacterial concentrations were determined for 10 pure cultures of ruminal bacteria: butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, d16f, h10b, and h17c; fibrobacter succinogenes b21a; lachnospira multiparus d25e; lactobacillus lactis ard26e; prevotella ruminicola h15a; ruminococcus albus 7; ruminococcus flavefaciens b34b; and streptococcus bovis ard5d. the cv for the most-probable-number (mpn) assay (bacterial concentrations), purine analysis, and protein analysis were 55.86, 5.25 and 6.52%, respectively. considerable variation was found among bacterial species and strains when purine and protein concentrations were compared as the amount per individual cell. more consistent values were obtained when these components were  expressed on a dry matter basis. purine:protein ratios for the 10 pure cultures ranged from .023 to .1299, with a mean value of .0883. for samples of mixed bacteria separated from ruminal fluid, this ratio was found to average .0306, which is approximately one-third of the value for the pure cultures. the value determined for the mixed bacterial sample is similar to previously reported values. based on the ratio obtained with the pure cultures, the microbial protein flow out of the rumen has probably been overestimated in most previous reports. limited studies suggest that the samples of mixed ruminal bacteria used as a standard are probably contaminated with feed particles containing protein, which  results in lower purine:protein ratios.

TI  == utilization of xylooligosaccharides by selected ruminal bacteria.
AB  == the ability of ruminal bacteria to utilize xylooligosaccharides was examined. xylooligosaccharides were prepared by partially hydrolyzing oat spelt xylan in phosphoric acid. this substrate solution was added (0.2%, wt/vol) to a complex medium containing yeast extract and trypticase that was inoculated with individual species of ruminal bacteria, and growth and utilization were monitored over time. all of the xylanolytic bacteria examined were able to utilize this oligosaccharide mixture as a growth substrate. butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, eubacterium ruminantium, and ruminococcus albus used xylooligosaccharides and whole, unhydrolyzed xylan to similar extents, while prevotella ruminicola used twice as much xylooligosaccharides as xylan (76 versus 34%). strains of selenomonas ruminantium were the only nonxylanolytic species that were able to grow on xylooligosaccharides. the ability of individual s. ruminantium strains to utilize xylooligosaccharides was correlated with the presence of xylosidase and arabinosidases activities.

TI  == the hydrolysis of lucerne cell-wall monosaccharide components by monocultures or  pair combinations of defined ruminal bacteria.
AB  == the defined ruminal bacterial strains fibrobacter succinogenes s85, ruminococcus  flavefaciens fd1, ruminococcus albus 7, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens d1, and bacteroides ruminicola ga33 were grown, in monocultures or as combinations of pair strains, on isolated lucerne cell-walls (cw) as the sole carbohydrate substrate. fibrobacter succinogenes s85 was the dominant strain determining extent of cw hydrolysis in all combinations with s85. the hydrolysis of cellulose, xylan, hemicellulose side-sugars, and total cw monosaccharides by pure s85 were: 58.8, 47.3, 66.9 and 57.0%, respectively. the strains combination s85 plus d1 comprised the highest complementary effect, increasing significantly the  hydrolysis of cellulose and total cw monosaccharides by 16% and 13%, respectively, above the values obtained by pure s85. this complementation was expressed also in growth pattern of bacteria. the monocultures of fd1, d1 and ga33 had very little hydrolytic effect on lucerne cellulose, but higher effects on xylan and hemicellulose side-sugars. the combinations d1 plus ga33 and 7 plus  ga33 were complementary in the hydrolysis of all cw polysaccharides. the combinations fd1 plus d1, fd1 plus ga33, and 7 plus d1 were complementary only with respect to hemicellulose hydrolysis. on the other hand, the cellulolytic combinations s85 plus fd1, s85 plus 7 and fd1 plus 7 demonstrated negative interactions in lucerne cw polysaccharides hydrolysis. under scanning electron microscopy (sem), s85 comprised the most dense layer of bacterial cell mass attached to and colonized on cw particles. the cell surface topology of the cellulolytic strains s85, fd1 and 7 attached to cw particles was specified by a coat of characteristic protuberant structures.

AB  == the complete nucleotide sequences of ruminococcus albus genes cela and celb coding for endoglucanase a (ega) and endoglucanase b (egb), respectively, have been determined. the cela structural gene consists of an open reading frame of 1095 bp. confirmation of the nucleotide sequence was obtained by comparing the predicted amino acid sequence with that derived by n-terminal analysis of purified ega. the celb structural gene consists of an open reading frame of 1227  bp; 7 bp upstream of the translational start codon of celb is a typical gram-positive shine-dalgarno sequence. the deduced n-terminal region of egb conforms to the general pattern for the signal peptides of secreted prokaryotic proteins. the complete celb gene, cloned into puc vectors, caused lethality in escherichia coli. in contrast, cela cloned in puc18, under the control of laczp,  directed high-level synthesis of ega in e. coli jm83. ega in cell-free extract, purified to near homogeneity by ion-exchange chromatography, had a mr of 44.5 kda. gene deletion and subcloning studies with cela revealed that ega hydrolysed  both cmc and xylan, and did not contain discrete functional domains. ega and egb  showed considerable homology with each other, in addition to exhibiting similarity with eg1 (r. albus), ege (clostridium thermocellum) and end (butyrivibrio fibrisolvens).

TI  == antigenic nature of the chloride-stimulated cellobiosidase and other cellulases of fibrobacter succinogenes subsp. succinogenes s85 and related fresh isolates.
AB  == polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies to the cl-stimulated cellobiosidase of fibrobacter succinogenes subsp. succinogenes s85 reacted with numerous proteins of both higher and lower molecular weights from f. succinogenes subsp. succinogenes s85, but not with escherichia coli proteins, and only one protein each from butyrivibrio fibrisolvens and ruminococcus albus. different profiles were observed for western blots (immunoblots) of peptide digests of both the purified enzyme from f. succinogenes and immunoreactive proteins of higher and lower molecular weights, demonstrating that they were different proteins. therefore, f. succinogenes appeared to produce numerous proteins with one or more common antigenic determinants. however, with the exception of cl-stimulated cellobiosidase, none were cellulases that have been characterized. an affinity-purified polyclonal antibody to cl-stimulated cellobiosidase reacted with numerous proteins in cells of each of three fresh isolates of f. succinogenes subsp. succinogenes and one of f. succinogenes subsp. elongata when  analyzed by western blotting. antibodies to periplasmic cellodextrinase, endoglucanase 2 (eg2), and eg3, when reacted in western blots with the various cellulases, including cl-stimulated cellobiosidase, revealed limited antigenic similarity among the different proteins and none with either b. fibrisolvens or r. albus proteins. the periplasmic cellodextrinase antibody reacted with an antigen with a size corresponding to cellodextrinase in each of the three f. succinogenes subsp. succinogenes isolates but not with any antigens from the f. succinogenes subsp. elongata isolate. the anti-eg2 antibody reacted with single antigens in each of the four isolates, while the anti-eg3 antibody reacted with only one of the four isolates.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == the ability of butyrivibrio fibrisolvens and other ruminal bacteria (6 species, 18 strains) to ferment a crude xylan from wheat straw or to ferment xylans from larchwood or oat spelts was studied. liquid cultures were monitored for carbohydrate utilization, cell growth (protein), and fermentation acid production. b. fibrisolvens 49, h17c, actf2, and d1 grew almost as well on one or more of the xylans as they did on cellobiose-maltose. b. fibrisolvens 12, r28, a38, x10c34, ard22a, and x6c61 exhibited moderate growth on xylans. partial fermentation of xylans was observed with bacteroides ruminicola b14, bacteroides  succinogenes s85, ruminococcus albus 7, ruminococcus flavefaciens c94 and fd1, and succinivibrio dextrinosolvens 22b. all xylans tested appeared to have a small fraction of carbohydrate that supported low levels of growth of nonxylanolytic strains such as selenomonas ruminantium hd4. compared to growth on hexoses, the same array of fermentation acids was produced upon growth on xylans for most strains; however, reduced lactate levels were observed for b. fibrisolvens 49 and selenomonas ruminantium hd4. measurements of enzyme activities of b. fibrisolvens actf2, 49, h17c, and d1 indicated that the xylobiase activities were cell associated and that the xylanase activities were predominantly associated with the culture fluid. the pattern of expression of these enzymes varied both between strains and between the carbon sources on which the strains were grown.

TI  == effects of potassium ion concentrations on the antimicrobial activities of ionophores against ruminal anaerobes.
AB  == the antimicrobial activities of monensin and lasalocid against representative strains of ruminal bacteria were evaluated in medium containing three different concentrations of potassium (1.3, 7.9, or 23.3 mm). the growth of eubacterium ruminantium was inhibited by low concentrations of ionophores (less than or equal to 0.16 mg/liter), while the strain of streptococcus bovis tested was resistant to high concentrations of ionophores (40 mg/liter) at all potassium concentrations tested. the mics of the ionophores for strains of bacteroides succinogenes, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, ruminococcus albus, and ruminococcus flavefaciens and for one strain of bacteroides ruminicola increased with increasing potassium concentrations in the medium. high concentrations of ionophores (40 mg/liter) decreased the maximum cell yields or increased the lag times or both in cultures of one strain of bacteroides ruminicola and two strains of selenomonas ruminantium but did not completely inhibit the growth of these organisms. increased potassium concentrations in the medium (from 7.9 to 23.3 mm) decreased the lag times or increased the cell yields or both when these three strains were grown in ionophore-containing medium, while the activities of lasalocid and monensin against these organisms were enhanced in the medium containing low potassium concentrations (1.3 mm). the data from this study suggest that extracellular potassium concentrations may influence the antimicrobial activities of ionophores in the rumen.

AB  == the dominant cecal bacteria in the high-arctic svalbard reindeer were characterized, their population densities were estimated, and cecal ph was determined in summer, when food quality and availability is good, and in winter,  when it is very poor. in summer the total culturable viable bacterial population  was (8.9 +/- 5.3) x 10(8) cells ml-1, whereas in winter it was (1.5 +/- 0.7) x 10(8) cells ml-1, representing a decrease to 17% of the summer population density. of the dominant species of cultured bacteria, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens  represented 23% in summer and 18% in winter. streptococcus bovis represented 17%  in summer and 5% in winter. bacteroides ruminicola represented 10% in summer and  26% in winter. in summer and winter, respectively, the proportion of the viable population showing the following activities was as follows: fiber digestion, 36 and 48%; cellulolysis, 10 and 6%; xylanolysis, 33 and 48%; and starch utilization, 77 and 71%. the most abundant cellulolytic species in summer was butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, representing 62% of the total cellulolytic population, and in winter it was ruminococcus albus, representing 80% of the total cellulolytic population. the most abundant xylanolytic species in summer was butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, and in winter it was bacteroides ruminicola, representing 59 and 54% of the xylanolytic isolates in summer and winter, respectively. the cecal bacterial of the svalbard reindeer have the ability to digest starch and the major structural carbohydrates of the diet that are not digested in the rumen. the cecum in these animals has the potential to contribute very substantially to the digestion of the available plant material in both summer and winter.

TI  == effect of phenolic monomers on ruminal bacteria.
AB  == ruminal bacteria were subjected to a series of phenolic compounds in various concentrations to acquire fundamental information on the influence on growth and  the potential limits to forage utilization by phenolic monomers. ruminococcus albus 7, ruminococcus flavefaciens fd-1, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens 49, and lachnospira multiparus d-32 were tested against 1, 5, and 10 mm concentrations of sinapic acid, syringaldehyde, syringic acid, ferulic acid, vanillin, vanillic acid, p-coumaric acid, p-hydroxybenzaldehyde, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, and hydrocinnamic acid. responses were variable and dependent on the phenolic compound and microbial species. compounds especially toxic (i.e., resulting in poor growth, effect on several species, dose-related response) were p-coumaric acid and p-hydroxybenzaldehyde, and adaptation to the toxins did not occur after  three 24-h periods. syringic, p-hydroxybenzoic, and hydrocinnamic acids stimulated growth of all four species and also stimulated filter paper degradation by r. flavefaciens. none of the stimulatory compounds supported microbial growth in the absence of carbohydrates. in vitro dry matter digestibility of cellulose (solka-floc) was not stimulated by any of the phenolic compounds (10 mm), but the cinnamic acids and benzoic aldehydes (10 mm) reduced (p less than 0.05) digestion by the mixed population in ruminal fluid. growth of  r. flavefaciens in the presence of p-hydroxybenzoic acid (10 mm) or p-coumaric acid (5 mm) resulted in recognizable alterations in cell ultrastructure. both phenolics caused a reduction in cell size (p less than 0.05), and p-coumaric acid caused a reduction in capsular size (p less than 0.05) and produced occasional pleomorphic cells.

TI  == influence of forage phenolics on ruminal fibrolytic bacteria and in vitro fiber degradation.
AB  == in vitro cultures of ruminal microorganisms were used to determine the effect of  cinnamic acid and vanillin on the digestibility of cellulose and xylan. cinnamic  acid and vanillin depressed in vitro dry matter disappearance of cellulose 14 and 49%, respectively, when rumen fluid was the inoculum. the number of viable bacteroides succinogenes cells, the predominant cellulolytic organism, was threefold higher for fermentations which contained vanillin than for control fermentations. when xylan replaced cellulose as the substrate, a 14% decrease in  the digestibility of xylan was observed with vanillin added; however, the number  of viable xylanolytic bacteria cultured from the batch fermentation was 10-fold greater than that of control fermentations. the doubling time of b. succinogenes  was increased from 2.32 to 2.58 h when vanillin was added to cellobiose medium, and absorbance was one-half that of controls after 18 h. the growth rate of ruminococcus albus and ruminococcus flavefaciens was inhibited more by p-coumaric acid than by vanillin, although no reduction of final absorbance was observed in  their growth cycles. vanillin, and to a lesser extent cinnamic acid, appeared to  prevent the attachment of b. succinogenes cells to cellulose particles, but did not affect dissociation of cells from the particles. b. succinogenes, r. albus, r. flavefaciens, and butyrivibrio fibrisolvens all modified the parent monomers cinnamic acid, p-coumaric acid, ferulic acid, and vanillin, with b. fibrisolvens  causing the most extensive modification. these results suggest that phenolic monomers can inhibit digestibility of cellulose and xylan, possibly by influencing attachment of the fibrolytic microorganisms to fiber particles. the reduced bacterial attachment to structural carbohydrates in the presence of vanillin may generate more free-floating fibrolytic organisms, thus giving a deceptively higher viable count.

AB  == fiber degradation in bermuda grass and orchard grass was evaluated gravimetrically and by scanning and transmission electron microscopy after incubation with pure cultures of rumen bacteria. lachnospira multiparus d-32 was  unable to degrade plant cell wall components. butyrivibrio fibrisolvens 49 degraded 6 and 14.9% of the fiber components in bermuda grass and orchard grass,  respectively, and ruminococcus albus 7 degraded 11.4% orchard grass fiber but none in bermuda grass. both b. fibrisolvens and r. albus lacked capsules, did not adhere to fiber, and degraded only portions of the more easily available plant cell walls. r. flavefaciens fd-1 was the most active fiber digester, degrading 8.2 and 55.3% of bermuda and orchard grass fiber, respectively. the microbe had a distinct capsule and adhered to fiber, especially that which is slowly degraded,  but was able to cause erosion and disorganization of the more easily digested cell walls, apparently by extracellular enzymes. results indicated that more digestible cell walls could be partially degraded by enzymes disassociated from cellulolytic and noncellulolytic bacteria, and data were consistent with the hypothesis that the more slowly degraded plant walls required attachment. microbial species as well as the cell wall architecture influenced the physical association with and digestion of plant fiber.

AB  == h2 production from glucose by ruminococcus albus was almost completely inhibited  by 10(-5) m molybdate only when sulfide was present in the growth medium. inhibition was accompanied by a significant increase in the production of formate. extracts of molybdate-sulfide-grown cells did not contain hydrogenase activity. active enzyme in extracts of uninhibited cells was not inhibited by the molybdate-sulfide-containing growth medium. the results indicate that a complex formed from molybdate and sulfide prevents the formation of active hydrogenase and electrons otherwise used to form h2 are used to reduce co2 to formate. growth was significantly inhibited when molybdate was increased to 10(-4) m. reversal of growth inhibition but not inhibition of h2 production occurred between 10(-4) and 10(-3) m molybdate. h2 production by r. bromei but not by r. flavefaciens, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, veillonella alcalescens, klebsiella pneumoniae and escherichia coli was inhibited by molybdate and sulfide.

TI  == effect of monensin and lasalocid-sodium on the growth of methanogenic and rumen saccharolytic bacteria.
AB  == it is thought that monensin increases the efficiency of feed utilization by cattle by altering the rumen fermentation. we studied the effect of monensin and  the related ionophore antibiotic lasalocid-sodium (hoffman-laroche) on the growth of methanogenic and rumen saccharolytic bacteria in a complex medium containing rumen fluid. ruminococcus albus, ruminococcus flavefaciens, and butyrivibrio fibrisolvens were inhibited by 2.5 mug of monensin or lasalocid per ml. growth of bacteroides succinogenes and bacteroides ruminicola was delayed by 2.5 mug of monensin or lasalocid per ml. populations of b. succinogenes and b. ruminicola that were resistant to 20 mug of either drug per ml were rapidly selected by growth in the presence of each drug at 5.0 mug/ml. selenomonas ruminantium was insensitive to 40 mug of monensin or lasalocid per ml. either antibiotic (10 mug/ml) inhibited methanobacterium moh, methanobacterium formicicum, and methanosarcina barkeri ms. methanobacterium ruminantium ps was insensitive to 40  mug of monensin or 20 mug of lasalocid per ml. the methanogenic strain 442 was insensitive to 40 mug of monensin but sensitive to 10 mug of lasalocid per ml. the results suggest that monensin or lasalocid acts in the rumen by selecting for succinate-forming bacteroides and for s. ruminantium, a propionate producer that  decarboxylates succinate to propionate. the selection could lead to an increase in rumen propionate formation. selection against h(2) and formate producers, e.g. r. albus, r. flavefaciens, and b. fibrisolvens, could lead to a depression of methane production in the rumen.

TI  == effects of heavy metals and other trace elements on the fermentative activity of  the rumen microflora and growth of functionally important rumen bacteria.
AB  == the inhibitory effects of high concentrations of essential and non-essential trace elements were tested on the rumen microflora using the rate of fermentation in vitro as the assay. the elements (and the concentration causing 50% inhibition) in decreasing order of toxicity were hg2+ (20 microgram/ml), cu2+ (21 microgram/ml), cr6+ (70 microgram/ml), se4+ (73 microgram/ml), ni2+ (160 microgram/ml), cd2+ (175 microgram/ml), as3+ (304 microgram/ml) and as5+ (1610 microgram/ml). the elements tested that were either weak or noninhibitory at concentrations greater than 400 microgram/ml included zn2+, cr2+, fe2+, mn2+, pb2+, and co2+. methylmercury was as inhibitory as mercuric chloride to the fermentation. when the inhibitory effect of cd2+ was tested on separated bacterial and protozoal fractions, it was more inhibitory to the bacteria. the inhibitory effects of trace elements were also determined for a number of axenic  cultures of rumen bacteria. the bacteria which most frequently exhibited the greatest sensitivity were bacteroides succinogenses, ruminococcus albus, bacteroides amylophilus, and eubacterium ruminantium. those often exhibiting intermediate sensitivities included butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, selenomonas ruminantium, and megasphera elsdenii, while streptococcus bovis was very refractory to all elements tested. rumen fluid provided a modest protective effect for the bacteria.

TI  == studies on some characteristics of hydrogen production by cell-free extracts of rumen anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == hydrogen production was studied in the following rumen anaerobes: bacteroides clostridiiformis, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, enbacterium limosum, fusobacterium necrophorum, megasphaera elsdenii, ruminococcus albus, and ruminococcus flavefaciens. clostridium pasteurianum and escherichia coli were included for comparative purposes. hydrogen production from dithionite, dithionite-reduced methyl viologen, pyruvate, and formate was determined. all species tested produced hydrogen from dithionite-reduce methyl viologen, but only c. pasteurianum, b. clostridiiformis, e. limosum, and m. elsdenii produced hydrogen  from dithionite. all species except e. coli produced hydrogen from pyruvate, but  activity was low or absent in extracts of e. limosum, f. necrophorum, r. albus, and r. flavefaciens unless methyl viologen was added. hydrogen was produced from  formate only by e. coli, b. clostridiiformis, e. limosum, f. necrophorum, and r.  flavefaciens. extracts were subjected to ultracentrifugation in an effort to determine the solubility of hydrogenase. the hydrogenase of all species except e. coli appeared to be soluble, although variable amounts of hydrogenase activity were detected in the pellet. treatment of extracts of the rumen microbial species with deae-cellulose resulted in loss ofhydrogen production from pyruvate. activity was restored by the addition of methyl viologen. it is concluded that hydrogen production in these rumen microorganisms is similar to that in the saccharolytic clostridia.

TI  == fermentation of isolated pectin and pectin from intact forages by pure cultures of rumen bacteria.
AB  == studies on the rate and extent of galacturonic acid and isolated pectin digestion were carried out with nine strains of rumen bacteria (butyrivibrio fibrisolvens h10b and d16f, bacteroides ruminicola 23 and d31d, lachnospira multiparus d15d, peptostreptococcus sp. d43e, b. succinogenes a3c, ruminococcus flavefaciens b34b, and r. albus 7). only three strains, 23, d16f, and d31d, utilized galacturonic acid as a sole energy source, whereas all strains except a3c and h10b degraded (solubilized) and utilized purified pectin. nutrient composition of the basal medium and separate sterilization of the substrate affected the rate and extent of fermentation for both substrates. pectin degradation and utilization were measured with two maturity stages each of intact bromegrass and alfalfa. for bromegrass i, all strains tested (b34b, 23, d16f, d31d, d15d, and d43e) degraded  a considerable amount of pectin and, with the exception of b34b, utilized most of what was degraded. similar, but lower, results were obtained with bromegrass ii,  except for the two strains of b. ruminicola, 23 and d31d, which were unable to degrade and utilize pectin from this forage. all strains were able to degrade and utilize pectin from both maturity stages of alfalfa; however, values were considerably lower for strains 23 and d31d. synergism studies, in which a limited utilizing strain, b34b, was combined with the limited degrading strain, d31d, resulted in a slight increase in degradation and a very marked increase in utilization of the pectin in all four forages. similar results were obtained on both alfalfa substrates with a combination of strains b34b and d16f; however, no  increases were observed with this combination on bromegrass.

TI  == carbon dioxide requirement of various species of rumen bacteria.
AB  == the carbon dioxide requirement of 32 strains of rumen bacteria, representing 11 different species, was studied in detail. increasing concentrations of co(2) were added as nahco(3) to a specially prepared co(2)-free medium which was tubed and inoculated under nitrogen. prior depletion of co(2) in the inoculum was found to  affect the level of requirement; however, the complexity and buffering capacity of the medium did not appear to be involved. an absolute requirement for co(2) was observed for eight strains of bacteroides ruminicola, three strains of bacteroides succinogenes, four strains of ruminococcus flavefaciens, two strains  of lachnospira multiparus, one strain of succinimonas amylolytica, and two strains of butyrivibrio fibrisolvens. inconsistent growth responses were obtained in co(2)-free media with one strain each of b. fibrisolvens, ruminococcus albus,  and selenomonas ruminantium. growth of six additional strains of b. fibrisolvens, and single strains of eubacterium ruminantium and succinivibrio dextrinosolvens was markedly increased or stimulated by increasing concentrations of co(2). peptostreptococcus elsdenii b159 was the only organism tested which appeared to have no requirement, either absolute or partial, for co(2). higher concentrations of co(2) were required for the initiation of growth, as well as for optimal growth, by those species which produce succinic acid as one of their primary end  products.

TI  == enzymatic studies of pure cultures of rumen microorganisms.
AB  == joyner, a. e., jr. (university of california, davis), and r. l. baldwin. enzymatic studies of pure cultures of rumen microorganisms. j. bacteriol. 92:1321-1330. 1966.-the activities of enzymes representing the major pathways of  carbohydrate metabolism and anaerobic electron transport in cell-free extracts of whole rumen contents have been reported. the effects of diet upon the activities  of several enzymes suggested that enzymatic measurements might prove useful for the study of rumen metabolism. in the present study, the distribution and characteristics of aldolase, succinate dehydrogenase, glutamate dehydrogenase, lactyl-coenzyme a dehydrase, lactate dehydrogenase, and other enzymes were measured in cell-free extracts of pure cultures of ruminococcus flavefaciens, r.  albus, bacteroides succinogenes, b. ruminicola, b. amylophilus, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, peptostreptococcus elsdenii, streptococcus bovis, and selenomonas ruminantium. some enzymes were widely distributed (aldolase, glutamate dehydrogenase), whereas others were observed in one or two species (lactyl-coenzyme a dehydrase). the cofactor requirements and kinetic characteristics of enzymes varied considerably with species. enzymes that vary with species might be employed as indices for estimating the activities of various groups of microorganisms in whole rumen contents.
