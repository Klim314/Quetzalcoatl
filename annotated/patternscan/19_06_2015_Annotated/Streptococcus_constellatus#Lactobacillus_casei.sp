TI  == molecular detection of in-vivo microbial contamination of metallic orthodontic brackets by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization.
AB  == introduction: knowing the microbiota that colonizes orthodontic appliances is important for planning strategies and implementing specific preventive measures during treatment. the purpose of this clinical trial was to evaluate in vivo the  contamination of metallic orthodontic brackets with 40 dna probes for different bacterial species by using the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization (cddh) technique. methods: eighteen patients, 11 to 29 years of age having fixed orthodontic treatment, were enrolled in the study. each subject had 2 new metallic brackets bonded to different premolars in a randomized manner. after 30  days, the brackets were removed and processed for analysis by cddh. data on bacterial contamination were analyzed descriptively and with the kruskal-wallis and dunn post tests (alpha = 0.05). forty microbial species (cariogenic microorganisms, bacteria of the purple, yellow, green, orange complexes, "red complex +treponema socranskii," and the cluster of actinomyces) were assessed. results: most bacterial species were present in all subjects, except for streptococcus constellatus, campylobacter rectus, tannerella forsythia, t socranskii, and lactobacillus acidophillus (94.4%), propionibacterium acnes i and eubacterium nodatum (88.9%), and treponema denticola (77.8%). among the cariogenic microorganisms, streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sobrinus were found in larger numbers than l acidophillus and lactobacillus casei (p <0.001). the periodontal pathogens of the orange complex were detected in larger numbers than those of the "red complex +t socranskii" (p <0.0001). among the bacteria not associated with specific pathologies, veillonella parvula (purple complex) was the most frequently detected strain (p <0.0001). the numbers of yellow and green  complex bacteria and the cluster of actinomyces were similar (p >0.05). conclusions: metallic brackets in use for 1 month were multi-colonized by several bacterial species, including cariogenic microorganisms and periodontal pathogens, reinforcing the need for meticulous oral hygiene and additional preventive measures to maintain oral health in orthodontic patients.

TI  == the acid-tolerant microbiota associated with plaque from initial caries and healthy tooth surfaces.
AB  == the intent of this study was to compare the inherent acid tolerance of bacteria in samples of dental plaque from tooth sites in subjects with and without initial caries. plaque was collected from approximal surfaces showing early enamel caries and from healthy tooth surfaces in the same subjects, as well as from enamel surfaces of caries-free individuals. in addition to plating on blood agar, the plaque samples were plated directly on non-selective solid agar medium buffered to ph 7.0, 6.0, 5.5, 5.0, 4.5 and 4.0 to avoid any loss of adaptation to acid during primary isolation of plaque bacteria. the results showed that approximately 50% of the total cultivable plaque microbiota from caries, as well  as healthy tooth sites, was able to grow at ph 5.5 and 1% at ph 5.0, ph values regarded as critical for the demineralization of tooth enamel. at ph 5.0, members of the genus streptococcus were the dominant group, but mutans streptococci accounted for less than half of the streptococcal viable count. the other acid-tolerant streptococcal isolates included streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus constellatus, streptococcus gordinii, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus salivarius and sstreptococcus sanguis. analysis of the results indicated that the mutans streptococci in dental plaque were highly variable with respect to acid tolerance, and that both caries and healthy sites harboured significant numbers of mutans streptococci that were not acid-tolerant.
