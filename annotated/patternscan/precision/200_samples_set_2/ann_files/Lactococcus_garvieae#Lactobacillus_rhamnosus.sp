TI  == the spatial distribution of bacteria in grana-cheese during ripening.
AB  == the microbial composition and its spatial distribution of grana trentino, a hard  parmesan-like cheese, was determined, from vat milk to cheese. after cutting along the vertical axis of the cheese wheels, three layers were sampled diagonally across the cheese: under the cheese rind, an intermediate section and  the cheese core. after two different ripening periods (9 and 18 months), the cheese samples were analysed using traditional culture dependent and culture independent methods. milk samples were dominated by mesophilic and psychrophilic  bacterial counts. thermophilic bacteria (lactobacillus helveticus) were found in  high amounts in cooked whey and natural whey starter cultures. after 9 months of  ripening, lactic acid bacteria (lab) counts were higher than those after 18 months. furthermore, the lab numbers in the cheese core was lower than those under the rind or in the intermediate section. the main lab species isolated from milk (lactococcus lactis, pediococcus pentosaceus, streptococcus uberis and lactococcus garvieae) were not found in the corresponding cheeses. some differences were observed in the species composition among the three cheese sections. microbiota under the rind and in the intermediate section was similar and dominated by lactobacillus paracasei and lactobacillus rhamnosus. the core, after 18 months of ripening, was characterized by a total absence of lab. in each sample, all lab were genotypically grouped and the different biotypes were subjected to several technological tests indicating that some non-starter lab (nslab) displayed technological features that are favorable for the production of grana trentino cheese.

TI  == biodiversity of lactic acid bacteria in moroccan soft white cheese (jben).
AB  == the bacterial diversity occurring in traditional moroccan soft white cheese, produced in eight different regions in morocco, was studied. a total of 164 lactic acid bacteria were isolated, purified and identified by whole-cell protein fingerprinting and rep-pcr genomic fingerprinting. the majority of the strains belonged to the genera lactobacillus, lactococcus, leuconostoc and enterococcus.  sixteen species were identified: lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus buchneri, lactococcus lactis, lactococcus garvieae, lactococcus raffinolactis, leuconostoc  pseudomesenteroides, leuconostoc mesenteroides, leuconostoc citreum, eterococcus  durans, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus saccharominimus and streptococcus sp.
