TI  - Drastic changes in fecal and mucosa-associated microbiota in adult patients with  short bowel syndrome.
AB  - Short bowel syndrome (SBS) is observed in Humans after a large resection of gut.  Since the remnant colon and its associated microbiota play a major role in the outcome of patients with SBS, we studied the overall qualitative and quantitative microbiota composition of SBS adult patients compared to controls. The population was composed of 11 SBS type II patients (with a jejuno-colonic anastomosis) and 8 controls without intestinal pathology. SBS patients had 38 +/- 30 cm remnant small bowel length and 66 +/- 19% of residual colon. The repartition of proteins, lipids, carbohydrates and fibres was expressed as % of total oral intake in patients and controls. The microbiota was profiled from stool and biopsy samples with temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis and quantitative PCR. We show here that microbiota of SBS patients is unbalanced with a high prevalence of Lactobacillus along with a sub-dominant presence and poor diversity of Clostridium leptum, Clostridium coccoides and Bacteroidetes. In addition, Lactobacillus mucosae was detected within the fecal and mucosa-associated microbiota of SBS patients, whereas it remained undetectable in controls. Thus, in SBS the microbial composition was deeply altered in fecal and mucosal samples, with a shift between dominant and sub-dominant microbial groups and the prevalence of L. mucosae.
TI  - Lactobacillus rhamnosus R11 consumed in a food supplement survived human digestive transit without modifying microbiota equilibrium as assessed by real-time polymerase chain reaction.
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the survival of Lactobacillus rhamnosus R11 and Lactobacillus acidophilus R52 in the human digestive tract and their effects on the microbiota homeostasis. We designed an open human trial including 14 healthy volunteers. A 3-week exclusion period of fermented products was followed by a 12-day consumption period of 4 capsules daily containing 2 x 10(9)L. rhamnosus R11 and 1 x 10(8)L. acidophilus R52, and a 12-day wash-out period. The 2 strains and dominant bacterial groups of the microbiota were quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction. At the end of the capsule consumption period, high levels of L. rhamnosus R11 were detected in faecal samples from all volunteers, reaching a mean value of 7.1 log(10) colony-forming unit (CFU) equivalents/g of stool. L. acidophilus R52 was detected in the stools of only 1 volunteer, reaching a maximum level of 6.1 log(10) CFU equivalents/g of stool. Dilution plating enumerations performed in parallel provided less consistent and generally lower levels. No significant effect of capsule consumption was observed on microbiota homeostasis for the dominant faecal populations. Mean values of 8.8, 9.2, 9.9 and 10.6 log(10) CFU equivalents/g of stool were obtained for the Clostridium coccoides, Bifidobacterium sp., Bacteroides sp. and Clostridium leptum groups, respectively.
