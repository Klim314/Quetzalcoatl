TI  == cell-free supernatants from probiotic lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus rhamnosus gg decrease colon cancer cell invasion in vitro.
AB  == probiotics have been shown to have a preventative role in colorectal carcinogenesis but research concerning their prophylactic potential in the later  stages of colorectal cancer, specifically metastasis is limited. this study explored the potential of cell-free supernatants (cfs) from 2 probiotic lactobacillus sp., lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, to inhibit colon cancer cell invasion by influencing matrix metalloproteinase-9 (mmp-9) activity and levels of the tight junction protein zona occludens-1 (zo-1) in cultured metastatic human colorectal carcinoma cells. hct-116 cells were treated  with cfs from l. casei, l. rhamnosus, or bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (a gut commensal); or with uninoculated bacterial growth media. treatment with cfs from  both lactobacillus sp. decreased colorectal cell invasion but treatment with cfs  from b. thetaiotaomicron did not. cfs from both lactobacillus sp. decreased mmp-9 and increased zo-1 protein levels. l. rhamnosus cfs also lowered mmp-9 activity.  to begin elucidating the secreted bacterial factor conveying these responses, lactobacillus sp. cfs were fractionated into defined molecular weight ranges and  cell invasion assessed. fractionation revealed that the inhibitory activity was contained primarily in the >100 kda and 50-100 kda fractions, suggesting the inhibitory compound may be a macromolecule such as a protein, nucleic acid, or a  polysaccharide.

TI  == changes in gut microbiota in children with atopic dermatitis administered the bacteria lactobacillus casei dn--114001.
AB  == gut microbiota was analyzed in children, aged 6-18 months and suffering from atopic dermatitis before and after 3 month supplementation of their diet with lactobacillus casei dn--114001 in a dose of 109 cells daily. on completion of this period the total number of fecal lactobacillus sp. cells decreased from 7.86 log10 cfu/g to 6.40 log10 cfu/g. after the next 5 months (without dietary supplementation with the probiotic bacteria) the level of lactobacillus sp. cells was maintained at the latter value. during the dietary supplementation with the probiotic strain, the level of bifidobacterium cells was maintained at 6.15-6.89  log10 cfu/g while after 5 months it decreased to 5.57 log10 cfu/g. the population of clostridium sp. was reduced after 3 months of dietary supplementation from 6.49 to 5.83 log10 cfu/g and was maintained at the latter level during the next 5 months. the dietary supplementation had no effect on populations of bacteroides sp., enterococcus sp. and enterobacteriaceae. supplementation of children who developed atopic dermatitis with the preparation of lactobacillus casei dn - 114001 positively affected their gut microbiota in terms of bifidobacteria and clostridia populations.

TI  == analysis of intestinal flora of a patient with congenital absence of the portal vein.
AB  == a 14-year-old female patient, admitted for a closer examination of liver tumour (hepatocellular adenoma), was diagnosed as having a congenital absence of the portal vein. the blood ammonia level (approximately 120 micrograms dl-1) in the superior mesenteric vein was markedly low compared to the normal value of 300-350 micrograms dl-1 in the portal vein. the decreased ammonia concentration and urease activity of the patient's faeces were demonstrated. the dominant intestinal flora in the faeces of the patient, before operation, was bifidobacterium sp., bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium lonqum, lactobacillus plantarum, and after the operation bacteroides vulgatus, veillonella parvula, peptococcus magnus bifidobacterium longum. in contrast, bifidobacterium bifidum,  bacteroides ureolyticus, bacteroides ovatus and bacteroides distasonis, b. ovatus, bifidobacterium adolescentis were dominant flora in the faeces of two healthy volunteers, respectively. among microorganisms isolated from the patient, morganella morganii, candida sp., eubacterium aerofacience and eubacterium rectale were strongly positive in urease activity in vitro; streptococcus mitior, staphylococcus intermedius, micrococcus kristinae, selenomonas ruminantum, bacteroides ureolyticus and lactobacillus casei ss. pseudoplantarum from the healthy volunteers. these results imply the homeostatic regulation system of faecal ammonia concentration by urease-producing microorganisms in the patient.

TI  == the establishment of reproducible, complex communities of oral bacteria in the chemostat using defined inocula.
AB  == nine commonly isolated oral bacterial populations were inoculated into a glucose-limited and a glucose-excess (amino acid-limited) chemostat maintained at a constant ph 7.0 and a mean community generation time of 13.9 h. the bacterial populations were streptococcus mutans atcc 2-27351, strep. sanguis nctc 7865, strep. mitior ef 186, actinomyces viscosus wvu 627, lactobacillus casei ac 413, neisseria sp. a1078, veillonella alkalescens atcc 17745, bacteroides intermedius  t 588 and fusobacterium nucleatum nctc 10593. all nine populations became established in the glucose-limited chemostat although strep. sanguis and neisseria sp. were present only after a second and third inoculation, respectively. in contrast, even following repeated inoculations, strep. mutans, b. intermedius and neisseria sp. could not be maintained under glucose-excess conditions. a more extensive pattern of fermentation products and amino acid catabolism occurred under glucose-limited growth; this simultaneous utilization of mixed substrates also contributed to the higher yields (y molar glucose) and greater species diversity of these communities. microscopic and biochemical evidence suggested that cell-to-cell interactions and food chains were occurring  among community members. to compare the reproductibility of this system, communities were established on three occasions under glucose-limitation and twice under glucose-excess conditions. the bacterial composition of the steady-state communities and their metabolic behaviour were similar when grown under identical conditions but varied in a consistent manner according to the nutrient responsible for limiting growth. although a direct simulation of the oral cavity was not attempted, the results show that the chemostat could be used  as an environmentally-related model to grow complex but reproducible communities  of oral bacteria for long periods from a defined inoculum.
