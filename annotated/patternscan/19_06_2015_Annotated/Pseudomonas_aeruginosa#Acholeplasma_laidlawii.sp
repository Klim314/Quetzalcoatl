TI  == systematic development and validation of sanitization protocols for a chromatographic system designed for biotherapeutics purification.
AB  == production of protein therapeutics through the application of genetic engineering and biotechnology techniques requires comprehensive attention to good manufacturing practice and good laboratory practice (gmp/glp) guidelines for product recovery and purification. validated clean-in-place procedures are part of the master method and require analysis of microbial bioburden to assess the efficacy of cleaning protocols. this article describes the extensive microbial challenge of a chromatography system, the use of membrane filtration methods for  high sensitivity microbial contamination measurement, and the effectiveness of sodium hydroxide and ethanol solutions in achieving multilog reduction of microbial contamination.
