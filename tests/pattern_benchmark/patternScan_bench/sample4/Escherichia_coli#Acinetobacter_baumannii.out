hydroxy tricyclic 1,5-naphthyridinone oxabicyclooctane-linked novel bacterial topoisomerase inhibitors as broad-spectrum antibacterial agents-sar of rhs moiety (part-3).
novel bacterial topoisomerase inhibitors (nbtis) are a new class of broad-spectrum antibacterial agents targeting bacterial gyrase a and parc and have potential utility in combating antibiotic resistance. (r)-hydroxy-1,5-naphthyridinone left-hand side (lhs) oxabicyclooctane linked pyridoxazinone right-hand side (rhs) containing nbtis showed a potent gram-positive antibacterial profile. sar around the rhs moiety, including substitutions around pyridooxazinone, pyridodioxane, and phenyl propenoids has been described. a fluoro substituted pyridoxazinone showed an mic against staphylococcus aureus of 0.5mug/ml with reduced functional herg activity (ic50 333mum) and good in vivo efficacy [ed90 12mg/kg, intravenous (iv) and 15mg/kg, oral (p.o.)]. a pyridodioxane-containing nbti showed a s. aureus mic of 0.5mug/ml, significantly improved herg ic50 764mum and strong efficacy of 11mg/kg (iv) and 5 mg/kg (p.o.). a phenyl propenoid series of compounds showed potent antibacterial activity, but also showed potent herg binding activity. many of the compounds in the hydroxy-tricyclic series showed strong activity against acinetobacter baumannii, but reduced activity against escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa. bicyclic heterocycles appeared to be the best rhs moiety for the hydroxy-tricyclic oxabicyclooctane linked nbtis.
activity of eravacycline against enterobacteriaceae and acinetobacter baumannii,  including multidrug-resistant isolates, from new york city.
eravacycline demonstrated in vitro activity against a contemporary collection of  more than 4,000 gram-negative pathogens from new york city hospitals, with mic50/mic90 values, respectively, for escherichia coli of 0.12/0.5 mug/ml, klebsiella pneumoniae of 0.25/1 mug/ml, enterobacter aerogenes of 0.25/1 mug/ml, enterobacter cloacae 0.5/1 mug/ml, and acinetobacter baumannii of 0.5/1 mug/ml. activity was retained against multidrug-resistant isolates, including those expressing kpc and oxa carbapenemases. for a. baumannii, eravacycline mics correlated with increased expression of the adeb gene.
[trends in antibiotic resistance in medellin and municipalities of the metropolitan area between 2007 and 2012: results of six years of surveillance].
introduction: bacterial resistance is a global phenomenon, but it presents geographic and temporal variations; this is the importance of local surveillance programs. objective: to determine trends in antibiotic resistance in hospitals between 2007 and 2012 in medellin and its metropolitan area. materials and methods: percentages of antibiotic resistance between 2007 and 2012 in 22 institutions were obtained using whonet 5.6 program. for interpretation of susceptibility results, clsi standards of 2009 and 2012 were used. using the epi-info 6.04 program a trends analysis of antibiotic resistance was done using the chi-square for linear trend with a confidence level of 95%, a value of p=0.05 was considered significant. results: in six years of surveillance of antibiotic resistance we found a decrease of oxacillin resistance in staphylococcus aureus (p=0.0006) and an increase of vancomycin resistance in enterococcus faecium (p=0.0000). in escherichia coli and serratia marcescens an increase of resistance to ceftazidime was found, in contrast to a decrease in klebsiella pneumoniae (p=0.0000) and enterobacter cloacae (p=0.058). k. pneumoniae , s. marcescens and e. cloacae showed an increase of carbapenem resistance in contrast to a reduction of carbapenem resistance in pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii . conclusions: the resistance surveillance identified important findings as the emergence of e. faecium resistant to vancomycin and carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae . it is essential to determine the antibiotic use in the region to establish their influence on the resistance profiles, as well as ensuring the quality of information and microbiological procedures in the microbiology laboratories.
update on acinetobacter species: mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance and contemporary in vitro activity of minocycline and other treatment options.
among acinetobacter species, a. baumannii and other closely related species are commonly implicated in nosocomial infections. these organisms are usually multidrug resistant (mdr), and therapeutic options to treat a. baumannii infections are very limited. clinicians have been resorting to older antimicrobial agents to treat infections caused by mdr a. baumannii, and some of these agents have documented toxicity and/or are not optimized for the infection type to be treated. recent clinical experience supported by antimicrobial susceptibility data suggests that minocycline has greater activity than other tetracyclines and glycylcyclines against various mdr pathogens that have limited therapeutic options available, including acinetobacter species. an intravenous formulation of minocycline has recently become available for clinical use, and in contrast to most older tetracyclines, minocycline has high activity against acinetobacter species. in this report, we summarized some of the characteristics of the tetracycline class, and quantified the minocycline activity against contemporary (2007-2011) isolates and its potential therapeutic role against a collection of 5477 a. baumannii and other relevant gram-negative organisms when compared directly with tetracycline, doxycycline, and other broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents. acinetobacter baumannii strains were highly resistant to all agents tested, with the exception of minocycline (79.1% susceptible) and colistin (98.8% susceptible). minocycline (minimum inhibitory concentration that inhibits 50% and 90% of the isolates [mic(50/90)]: 1/8 microg/ml) displayed greater activity than doxycycline (mic(50/90): 2/>8 microg/ml) and tetracycline hydrochloride (hcl) (only 30.2% susceptible) against a. baumannii isolates, and was significantly more active than other tetracyclines against burkholderia cepacia, escherichia coli, serratia marcescens, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia isolates. in vitro susceptibility testing using tetracycline hcl as a surrogate for the susceptibility other tetracyclines fails to detect minocycline-susceptible isolates and the potential utility of minocycline for the treatment of many mdr a. baumannii infections and other difficult-to-treat species, where there are often limited choices of antimicrobials.
antimicrobial consumption and resistance in five gram-negative bacterial species  in a hospital from 2003 to 2011.
background: the misuse of antimicrobial agents increases drug resistance in bacteria. methods: the correlation between antimicrobial agent consumption and related resistance in the gram-negative bacteria acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and proteus mirabilis was analyzed during the period 2003-2011. results: among these five bacteria, overall e. coli and k. pneumoniae were more commonly isolated from bloodstream than the other species. regarding enterobacteriaceae, e. coli and k. pneumoniae showed annual increases of resistance to the tested antimicrobial agents; conversely, p. mirabilis exhibited reduced resistance to cefuroxime, ceftriaxone and cefepime. in contrast to the relatively low antimicrobial resistance in p. aeruginosa, a. baumannii revealed high resistance, which was over 85% resistant rate to the tested antimicrobial agents and over 80% carbapenem resistance in 2011. e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and p. mirabilis differed in development of antimicrobial resistance after consumption of the antimicrobial agents. k. pneumoniae developed resistance to all antimicrobial groups, whereas resistance in p. mirabilis was not related to any antimicrobial consumption. p. aeruginosa developed resistance to beta-lactam antimicrobials and aminoglycosides, whereas a. baumanii developed resistance to carbapenems after their use. conclusion: the development of antimicrobial resistance was related to antimicrobial agents and bacterial species.
impact of susceptibility profiles of gram-negative bacteria before and after the  introduction of ertapenem at a medical center in northern taiwan from 2004 to 2010.
this retrospective observational study evaluated the impact of antimicrobial consumption on antimicrobial susceptibility among aerobic gram-negative bacteria after introducing ertapenem to the formulary of a teaching hospital (1130 beds) in northern taiwan. data on consumption of various antimicrobial agents, expressed as defined daily dose/1000 patient-days (ddd/1000 pd), were collected retrospectively from hospital pharmacy records 2 years before and 5 years after the introduction of ertapenem (october 2005). during the study period, the consumption of ampicillin and aminoglycosides decreased significantly. in contrast, the consumption of cefoxitin, ceftazidime, cefpirome, piperacillin-tazobactam, carbapenems (ertapenem, imipenem, and meropenem), and fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, and moxifloxacin) increased significantly over time. there was a significant increase in the rate of susceptibility of escherichia coli to ampicillin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, piperacillin-tazobactam, cefpirome, amikacin, and levofloxacin; an increase in the rate of susceptibility of klebsiella pneumoniae to ceftazidime, cefepime, cefpirome, piperacillin-tazobactam, meropenem, levofloxacin, and amikacin; a significant decrease in the rate of susceptibility of pseudomonas aeruginosa to meropenem; and a significant decrease in the rate of susceptibility of acinetobacter baumannii to ceftazidime, carbapenems, ciprofloxacin, and levofloxacin. the rate of antibiotic susceptibility to ertapenem of extended spectrum beta-lactamase producers, including e. coli and k. pneumoniae, remained stable. usage of ertapenem was found to be negatively and significantly associated with the susceptibility rates of p. aeruginosa to meropenem and gentamicin. significantly negative correlations were noted between the use of ertapenem and the rates of susceptibility of a. baumannii to ceftazidime, piperacillin-tazobactam, carbapenems (imipenem and meropenem), ciprofloxacin, and levofloxacin.
monitoring of antibiotic resistance in bacteria isolated from laboratory animals.
the drug resistance of microorganisms isolated from laboratory animals never treated with antibiotics is being reported consistently, while the number of laboratory animals used in medicine, pharmacy, veterinary medicine, agriculture, nutrition, and environmental and health science has increased rapidly in korea. therefore, this study examined the development of antimicrobial resistance in bacteria isolated from laboratory animals bred in korea. a total of 443 isolates (7 species) containing 5 sphingomonas paucimobilis, 206 escherichia coli, 60 staphylococcus aureus, 15 staphylococcus epidermidis, 77 enterococcus faecalis, 27 citrobacter freundii, 35 acinetobacter baumannii were collected from the nose, intestine, bronchus and reproductive organs of icr mice and sd rats. of these species, acinetobacter baumannii and enterococcus faecalis showed significant antimicrobial resistance according to the minimum inhibition concentration (mic) in e-test. in case of acinetobacter baumannii, several isolates showed mic values 16-128 microg/ml for cefazolin and cefoxitin, and higher resistance (128-512 microg/ml) to nitrofurantoin than that of standard type. resistance to cefazolin, cefoxitin and nitrofurantoin was detected in 17.14, 20.00, and 8.57% of the acinetobacter baumannii isolates, respectively. in addition, 44.1% of the enterococcus faecalis isolates collected from the laboratory animals were resistant to oxacillin concentration of 16-32 microg/ml range, while mic value of standard type was below oxacillin concentration of 6 microg/ml. these results suggest that in rodent species of laboratory animals, acinetobacter baumannii are resistance to cefazolin, cefoxitin and nitrofurantoin, whereas those of enterococcus faecalis were resistance to oxacillin.
effects on salmonella shell contamination and trans-shell penetration of coating  hens' eggs with chitosan.
chitosan is a biopolymer with antimicrobial activity and film-forming properties. in this study, the effects on salmonella shell contamination and trans-shell penetration of coating hens' eggs with chitosan was evaluated. a chitosan was selected from eight types (four non-commercial and four commercial) based on its antimicrobial activity against salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis (s. enteritidis). for this purpose, a contact plate method was developed and chitosans were applied at a concentration of 0.25% (w/v). a commercial type with a molecular weight of 310-375 kda and a deacetylation degree of 75% that reduced s. enteritidis by 0.71 log(10) colony forming units compared to the control (without chitosan) was selected for further studies. the chitosan was shown to have antimicrobial activity against other egg borne bacteria, i.e., acinetobacter baumannii, alcaligenes sp., carnobacterium sp., pseudomonas sp., serratia marcescens and staphylococcus warneri, and against s. enterica serovar typhimurium, escherichia coli and listeria monocytogenes. the effects of various concentrations of the selected chitosan (0.25%, 1% and 2%) on salmonella shell contamination and trans-shell penetration were assessed using the agar molding technique. effective reduction of eggshell contamination could not be demonstrated, but trans-shell penetration was significantly reduced in the presence of a 2% chitosan eggshell coating, with only 6.1% of the eggs being penetrated compared to 24.5% of the uncoated eggs. it was concluded that the 2% chitosan coating has the potential to reduce contamination of egg contents resulting from trans-shell penetration by s. enteritidis.
expression, purification, and refolding of biologically active acinetobacter baumannii ompa from escherichia coli inclusion bodies.
infections caused by acinetobacter baumannii have emerged as a significant clinical problem due to the increase in infections caused by antibiotic resistant strains. a. baumannii ompa is a highly conserved membrane protein that has multiple roles in interacting with the host during infection, and thus represents an attractive target for the development of novel antibacterial therapies. in the present study, the coding sequence of the mature form of a. baumannii ompa was cloned into the vector pet-15b and purified under denaturing conditions from escherichia coli inclusion bodies using nickel affinity chromatography. a triton x-114 wash step was incorporated into the purification method in order to remove endotoxin, resulting in endotoxin levels of <1.3 eu/mg of protein. a protocol was developed for refolding the purified protein by dilution into the non-ionic detergent n-octyl-beta-d-glucopyranoside followed by dialysis to remove excess denaturant and detergent. cytotoxicity assays demonstrated that refolded a. baumannii ompa was able to induce cell death in a549 cells. in addition, a polyclonal antibody was raised against the refolded protein and used to assess extracellular secretion of ompa by western blot. this protein expression and purification system may be useful for further characterization of a. baumannii ompa.
[microorganisms isolated from blood cultures and their antimicrobial susceptibility patterns at a university hospital during 1994-2003].
background: blood culture is important for the determination of the etiologic agent of bacteremia. analysis of blood culture results and antimicrobial susceptibility trend can provide clinicians with relevant information for the empirical treatment of patients. methods: the species and antimicrobial susceptibility of the isolates from blood cultures at the severance hospital during 1994-2003 were analysed. blood specimens were cultured for 7 days using tryptic soy broth and thioglycollate medium. identification of organism was based on conventional methods or commercial kit systems. antimicrobial susceptibility was tested by a disk diffusion method. results: of 536,916 blood specimens cultured, 24,877 (4.6%) from 13,102 patients were positive. among the isolates, 93.1% were aerobic or facultative anaerobic bacteria, 3.3% anaerobes, and 3.6% fungi. escherichia coli was isolated most frequently, followed by staphylococcus aureus, alpha-hemolytic streptococcus, enterococcus spp., and klebsiella pneumoniae. the proportion of patients with enterococcus faecium and k. pneumoniae gradually increased during this study. enterococcus, s. aureus and alpha-hemolytic streptococcus were frequently isolated from the age group of less than 2 yr. e. coli, enterococcus spp., k. pneumoniae and s. aureus from the age group of over 50 yr. oxacillin-resistant s. aureus decreased, whereas vancomycin-resistant e. faecium and imipenemresistant pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii increased. conclusions: e. coli was the most common cause of bacteremia and s. aureus, alpha-hemolytic streptococcus, and k. pneumoniae were frequently isolated pathogens. the bacteremia due to enterococcus, k. pneumoniae, fungi, vancomycin-resistant e. faecium, and imipenem-resistant p. aeruginosa and a. baumannii gradually increased during this period.
assessment of the antibacterial activity of tea tree oil using the european en 1276 and en 12054 standard suspension tests.
the activity of tea tree oil (tto) and tto-containing products was investigated according to the en 1276 and en 12054 european suspension methods. the activity of different concentrations of tto, a hygienic skin wash (hsw), an alcoholic hygienic skin wash (ahsw) and an alcoholic hand rub (ahr) was investigated. these formulations were assessed in perfect conditions with the en 12054 test, and in perfect conditions as well as in the presence of interfering substances with the en 1276 test, against staphylococcus aureus, acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa. with the latter test, the activity of the same formulations without tto was also assessed as a control. with the en 1276 test, the ahr achieved a >10(5)-fold reduction against all four test organisms within a 1-min contact time. the ahsw achieved a >or=10(5)-fold reduction against a. baumannii after a 1-min contact time and against s. aureus, e. coli and p. aeruginosa after a 5-min contact time. the efficacy of tto appeared to be dependent on the formulation and the concentration tested, the concentration of interfering substances and, lastly, the organism tested. nevertheless, 5% tto achieved a >10(4)-fold reduction in p. aeruginosa cell numbers after a 5-min contact time in perfect conditions. tto (5%) in 0.001% tween 80 was significantly more active against e. coli and p. aeruginosa than against s. aureus and a. baumannii. with the en 12054 test, after a 1-min contact time, 5% tto in 0.001% tween 80 and the ahsw achieved a >10(4)-fold reduction in e. coli and a. baumannii cell numbers, respectively, and the ahr achieved a >4 log10 reduction against all organisms tested. the formulations used in this study are now being tested using a novel ex vivo method as well as the in vivo european standard handwashing method en 1499.
