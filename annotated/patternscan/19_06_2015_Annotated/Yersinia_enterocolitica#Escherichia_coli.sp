TI  == antimicrobial impacts of essential oils on food borne-pathogens.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of twelve essential oil (pine oil, eucalyptus, thyme,  sage tea, lavender, orange, laurel, lemon, myrtle, lemon, rosemary and juniper) was tested by a disc diffusion method against food borne pathogens (escherichia coli, salmonella paratyphi a, klebsiella pneumoniae, yersinia enterocolitica, pseudomonas aeruginosa, aeromonas hydrophila, campylobacter jejuni, enterococcus  faecalis, staphylococcus aureus). the major components in essential oils were monoterpenes hydrocarbons, alpha-pinene, limonene; monoterpene phenol, carvacrol  and oxygenated monoterpenes, camphor, 1,8-cineole, eucalyptol, linalool and linalyl acetate. although the antimicrobial effect of essential oils varied depending on the chemical composition of the essential oils and specific microorganism tested, majority of the oils exhibited antibacterial activity against one or more strains. the essential oil with the lowest inhibition zones was juniper with the values varied from 1.5 to 6 mm. however, the components of essential oil of thyme and pine oil are highly active against food borne pathogen, generating the largest inhibition zones for both gram negative and positive bacteria (5.25-28.25 mm vs. 12.5-30 mm inhibition zones). these results  indicate the possibility use of the essential oils on food system as antimicrobial agents against food-borne pathogen. the article also offers some promising patents on applications of essential oils on food industry as antimicrobial agent.

TI  == protozoan cysts act as survival niche and protective shelter for foodborne pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == the production of cysts, an integral part of the life cycle of many free-living protozoa, allows these organisms to survive adverse environmental conditions. given the prevalence of free-living protozoa in food-related environments, it is  hypothesized that these organisms play an important, yet currently underinvestigated role in the epidemiology of foodborne pathogenic bacteria. intracystic bacterial survival is highly relevant, as this would allow bacteria to survive the stringent cleaning and disinfection measures applied in food-related environments. the present study shows that strains of widespread and important foodborne bacteria (salmonella enterica, escherichia coli, yersinia enterocolitica, and listeria monocytogenes) survive inside cysts of the ubiquitous amoeba acanthamoeba castellanii, even when exposed to either antibiotic treatment (100 mug/ml gentamycin) or to highly acidic conditions (ph 0.2) and resume active growth in broth media following excystment. strain- and species-specific differences in survival period were observed, with salmonella enterica surviving up to three weeks inside amoebal cysts. up to 53% of the cysts were infected with pathogenic bacteria, which were located in the cyst cytosol. our study suggests that the role of free-living protozoa and especially their cysts in the persistence and epidemiology of foodborne bacterial pathogens in food-related environments may be much more important than hitherto assumed.

TI  == supercritical co2 extraction of functional compounds from spirulina and their biological activity.
AB  == supercritical carbon dioxide (scco2) extraction and fractionation of spirulina platensis was carried out to obtain functional compounds with antioxidant, antimicrobial and enzyme inhibitory activities. extraction of scco2 was carried out using 200 g of spirulina powder at 40 masculinec under 120 bar pressure with  co2 flow rate of 1.2 kg h(-1). scco2 fraction obtained was further treated with hexane and ethyl acetate to identify its components. individual components were identified by comparing mass spectra of samples with standard data and retention  indices (ri) of c5-c20 n-alkanes mixture using the kovat index formula. the phenolic and flavonoid content of the scco2 extract was found to be 0.34 +/- 0.01 g/100 g and 0.12 +/- 0.01 g/100 g respectively. the scco2 extract had antioxidant activity with ic50 value of 109.6 +/- 3.0 mug ml(-1) for dpph (2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl hydrazyl radical), ic50 value of 81.66 +/- 2.5 mug ml(-1)  for reducing power and ic50 value of 112.70 +/- 0.8 mug ml(-1) for hydroxyl radical scavenging activity. further, antioxidant activity study on oxidative induced dna damage was analysed to elucidate the positive role of scco2 extract.  scco2 extracts showed high antimicrobial activity against gram-positive bacteria  (staphylococcus aureus fri 722 and bacillus cereus f 4810) compared to that of gram negative bacteria (escherichia coli mtcc 108 and yersinia enterocolitica mtcc 859). the scco2 extract exhibited inhibitory activity on both angiotensin-1  converting enzyme and alpha-glucosidase with ic50 values of 274 +/- 1.0 mug ml(-1) and 307 +/- 2.0 mug ml(-1) respectively.

TI  == assessment of the microbiological quality of fresh produce on sale in sicily, italy: preliminary results.
AB  == background: fresh produce occupies an increasingly important place in the human food supply because of its health-promoting nutritional properties. most fresh produce is eaten raw or after minimal processing and, consequently, pathogen contamination can represent a serious health risk. there has been an increase in  foodborne outbreaks and cases associated with fresh produce, but literature data  about the prevalence of pathogen contamination are inconsistent. this study was undertaken to assess the hygienic quality and the prevalence of the most common bacterial pathogens in fresh produce sold in retail markets in sicily. a total of 125 samples of different types of vegetables were examined by standardized microbiological methods. results: the aerobic mesophilic count ranged between 2 log and 7 log cfu g(-1) and the enterobacteriaceae counts between < 1 log and 6 log cfu g(-1), with statistically significant differences between unprocessed and minimally processed products (p < 0.05). escherichia coli was detected only in leaf vegetables at a concentration of 2 log - 3 log cfu g(-1). enterococci were found at a concentration of 2 log - 4 log cfu g(-1). coagulase positive staphylococci and sulphite-reducing clostridia were not detected in any sample. three samples tested positive for listeria monocytogenes, yersinia enterocolitica and salmonella veneziana. conclusion: our study provides updated data on the microbiological quality of retail vegetables and confirms the need to implement strategies to increase microbial safety of fresh produce.

TI  == synthesis and antibacterial properties of 2,3-dideoxyglucosides of terpene alcohols and phenols.
AB  == essential oils and their oxygenated terpene constituents possess potent antimicrobial properties. in the present study, a facile synthetic route to the 2,3-dideoxy 1-o-glucosides of important phenols and terpene alcohols in excellent yields (85-96%) has been delineated. studies on their antimicrobial action against four food-borne pathogens - bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli and yersinia enterocolitica - demonstrated that the zone of inhibition, in general, was higher for the 2,3-unsaturated 1-o-glucoside derivatives (1b-6b) and the corresponding saturated glucosides (1c-5c) when compared to the parent alcohols/phenols (1-6). the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) values for these derivatives too were generally lower than those of the parent compounds. furthermore, the time-kill and bacteriolysis assays too demonstrated the greater  antimicrobial potential of the derivatives. the 2,3-dideoxy 1-o-glucosides of phenols and terpene alcohols were more effective in their antimicrobial action than the corresponding parent compounds. the study indicated that these novel derivatives can find useful application in control of food-related pathogenic microbes in foods.

TI  == csra impacts survival of yersinia enterocolitica by affecting a myriad of physiological activities.
AB  == background: a previous study identified a yersinia enterocolitica transposon mutant, gy448, that was unable to export the flagellar type three secretion system (t3ss)-dependent phospholipase, ypla. this strain was also deficient for motility and unable to form colonies on lauria-bertani agar medium. preliminary analysis suggested it carried a mutation in csra. csra in escherichia coli is an  rna-binding protein that is involved in specific post-transcriptional regulation  of a myriad of physiological activities. this study investigated how csra affects expression of the flagellar regulatory cascade that controls ypla export and motility. it also explored the effect of csra mutation on y. enterocolitica in response to conditions that cue physiological changes important for growth in environments found both in nature and the laboratory. results: the precise location of the transposon insertion in gmy448 was mapped within csra. genetic complementation restored disruptions in motility and the ypla export phenotype (yex), which confirmed this mutation disrupted csra function. mutation of csra affected expression of ypla and flagellar genes involved in flagellar t3ss dependent export and motility by altering expression of the master regulators flhdc. mutation of csra also resulted in increased sensitivity of y. enterocolitica to various osmolytes, temperatures and antibiotics. conclusions: the results of this study reveal unique aspects of how csra functions in y. enterocolitica to control its physiology. this provides perspective on how the csr system is susceptible to adaptation to particular environments and bacterial  lifestyles.

TI  == efficacy of ultraviolet (uv-c) light in a thin-film turbulent flow for the reduction of milkborne pathogens.
AB  == nonthermal technologies are being investigated as viable alternatives to, or supplemental utilization, with thermal pasteurization in the food-processing industry. in this study, the effect of ultraviolet (uv)-c light on the inactivation of seven milkborne pathogens (listeria monocytogenes, serratia marcescens, salmonella senftenberg, yersinia enterocolitica, aeromonas hydrophila, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus) was evaluated. the pathogens were suspended in ultra-high-temperature whole milk and treated at uv doses between 0 and 5000 j/l at a flow rate of 4300 l/h in a thin-film turbulent  flow-through pilot system. of the seven milkborne pathogens tested, l. monocytogenes was the most uv resistant, requiring 2000 j/l of uv-c exposure to reach a 5-log reduction. the most sensitive bacterium was s. aureus, requiring only 1450 j/l to reach a 5-log reduction. this study demonstrated that the survival curves were nonlinear. sigmoidal inactivation curves were observed for all tested bacterial strains. nonlinear modeling of the inactivation data was a better fit than the traditional log-linear approach. results obtained from this study indicate that uv illumination has the potential to be used as a nonthermal  method to reduce microorganism populations in milk.

TI  == microbiological diversity and prevalence of spoilage and pathogenic bacteria in commercial fermented alcoholic beverages (beer, fruit wine, refined rice wine, and yakju).
AB  == the present study examined 469 commercially available fermented alcoholic beverages (fabs), including beer (draft, microbrewed, and pasteurized), fruit wine (grape and others), refined rice wine, and yakju (raw and pasteurized). samples were screened for escherichia coli and eight foodborne pathogens (bacillus cereus, campylobacter jejuni, clostridium perfringens, escherichia coli o157:h7, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella spp., staphylococcus aureus, and yersinia enterocolitica), and the aerobic plate count, lactic acid bacteria, acetic acid bacteria, fungi, and total coliforms were also enumerated. microbrewed beer contained the highest number of microorganisms (average aerobic  plate count, 3.5; lactic acid bacteria, 2.1; acetic acid bacteria, 2.0; and fungi, 3.6 log cfu/ml), followed by draft beer and yakju (p < 0.05), whereas the  other fabs contained , 25 cfu/25 ml microorganisms. unexpectedly, neither microbial diversity nor microbial count correlated with the alcohol content (4.7  to 14.1%) or ph (3.4 to 4.2) of the product. despite the harsh conditions, coliforms (detected in 23.8% of microbrewed beer samples) and b. cereus (detected in all fabs) were present in some products. b. cereus was detected most frequently in microbrewed beer (54.8% of samples) and nonpasteurized yakju (50.0%), followed by pasteurized yakju (28.8%), refined rice wine (25.0%), other  fruit wines (12.3%), grape wine (8.6%), draft beer (5.6%), and pasteurized beer (2.2%) (p < 0.05). the finding that spore-forming b. cereus and coliform bacteria can survive the harsh conditions present in alcoholic beverages should be taken into account (alongside traditional quality indicators such as the presence of lactic acid-producing bacteria, acetic acid-producing bacteria, or both) when developing manufacturing systems and methods to prolong the shelf life of high-quality fab products. new strategic quality management plans for various fabs are needed.

TI  == expert elicitation as a means to attribute 28 enteric pathogens to foodborne, waterborne, animal contact, and person-to-person transmission routes in canada.
AB  == enteric illness contributes to a significant burden of illness in canada and globally. understanding its sources is a critical step in identifying and preventing health risks. expert elicitation is a powerful tool, used previously,  to obtain information about enteric illness source attribution where information  is difficult or expensive to obtain. thirty-one experts estimated transmission of 28 pathogens via major transmission routes (foodborne, waterborne, animal contact, person-to-person, and other) at the point of consumption. the elicitation consisted of a (snowball) recruitment phase; administration of a pre-survey to collect background information, an introductory webinar, an elicitation survey, a 1-day discussion, survey readministration, and a feedback exercise, and surveys were administered online. experts were prompted to quantify changes in contamination at the point of entry into the kitchen versus point of consumption. estimates were combined via triangular probability distributions, and medians and 90% credible-interval estimates were produced. transmission was attributed primarily to food for bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens, cyclospora cayetanensis, trichinella spp., all three vibrio spp. categories explored, and yersinia enterocolitica. multisource pathogens (e.g., transmitted commonly through both water and food) such as campylobacter spp., four escherichia coli categories, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella spp., and staphylococcus aureus were also estimated as mostly foodborne. water was the primary pathway for giardia spp. and cryptosporidium spp., and person-to-person transmission dominated for six enteric viruses and shigella spp. consideration of the point of attribution highlighted the importance of food handling and cross-contamination in the transmission pathway. this study provides source attribution estimates of enteric illness for canada, considering all possible transmission routes. further research is necessary to improve our understanding of poorly characterized pathogens such as sapovirus and e. coli subgroups in canada.

TI  == empirical prediction and validation of antibacterial inhibitory effects of various plant essential oils on common pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == in this study, fractional compound composition, antioxidant capacity, and phenolic substance content of 14 plant essential oils-anise (pimpinella anisum),  bay leaves (laurus nobilis), cinnamon bark (cinnamomum verum), clove (eugenia caryophyllata), fennel (foeniculum vulgare), hop (humulus lupulus), istanbul oregano (origanum vulgare subsp. hirtum), izmir oregano (origanum onites), mint (mentha piperita), myrtus (myrtus communis), orange peel (citrus sinensis), sage  (salvia officinalis), thyme (thymbra spicata), and turkish oregano (origanum minutiflorum)--were related to inhibition of 10 bacteria through multiple linear  or non-linear (m(n)lr) models-four gram-positive bacteria of listeria innocua, coagulase-negative staphylococci, staphylococcus aureus, and bacillus subtilis, and six gram-negative bacteria of yersinia enterocolitica, salmonella enteritidis, salmonella typhimurium, proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli o157:h7, and klebsiella oxytoca. a total of 65 compounds with different antioxidant capacity, phenolic substance content and antibacterial properties were detected with 14 plant essential oils. the best-fit m(n)lr models indicated that relative  to anise essential oil, the essential oils of oreganos, cinnamon, and thyme had consistently high inhibitory effects, while orange peel essential oil had consistently a low inhibitory effect. regression analysis indicated that beta-bisabolene (turkish and istanbul oreganos), and terpinolene (thyme) were found to be the most inhibitory compounds regardless of the bacteria type tested.

TI  == [water-borne outbreak of yersinia enterocolitica o8 due to a small scale water system].
AB  == a water-borne outbreak of yersinia enterocolitica o:8 associated with a small-scale water system occurred during july-august 2011 in toyama prefecture, japan. escherichia coli was not detected in tap water from the small-scale water  system. however, the maximum concentration of viable bacteria in the tap water was 700cfu/ml, which exceeds the legal standard for purity of tap water (100cfu/ml). furthermore, y. enterocolitica o8 was isolated from the tap water with the use of immunomagnetic beads prepared with anti-y. enterocolitica o8 antibodies. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis identified 3 isolates from  tap water and 5 isolates from 4 patient stool specimens as belonging to the outbreak strain. an epidemiological investigation revealed improper management of the residual chlorine concentration in the tap water. this is the first report of an outbreak of y. enterocolitica due to tap water from a small-scale water system in japan.

TI  == the expression of propionicin plg-1 gene (plg-1) by lactic starters.
AB  == propionicin plg-1 is a bacteriocin produced by propionibacterium thoenii p127. such bacteriocin inhibits wide range of food-borne pathogens such as pathogenic escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, vibrio parahaemolyticus, yersinia enterocolitica and a strain of corynebacterium sp. in the present study, plg-1 gene expressing propionicin plg-1 was isolated, sequenced for the first time and  the resulting sequence was analysed using several web-based bioinformatics programs. the pcr product containing plg-1 gene was transferred to different lactic acid bacterial (lab) strains using pleb590 as a cloning vector to give the modified vector plebplg-1. lab transformants showed an antimicrobial activity against esch. coli dh5alpha (most affected strain), listeria monocytogenes 18116, and salmonella enterica 25566 as model pathogenic strains. such lab transformants can be used in dairy industry to control the food-borne pathogens that are largely distributed worldwide and to feed schoolchildren in the poor countries where dangerous epidemic diseases and diarrhoea prevail.

TI  == pyrosequencing analysis of microbial community and food-borne bacteria on restaurant cutting boards collected in seri kembangan, malaysia, and their correlation with grades of food premises.
AB  == this study adopts the pyrosequencing technique to identify bacteria present on 26 kitchen cutting boards collected from different grades of food premises around seri kembangan, a city in malaysia. pyrosequencing generated 452,401 of total reads of otus with an average of 1.4x10(7) bacterial cells/cm(2). proteobacteria, firmicutes and bacteroides were identified as the most abundant phyla in the samples. taxonomic richness was generally high with >1000 operational taxonomic units (otus) observed across all samples. the highest appearance frequencies (100%) were otus closely related to enterobacter sp., enterobacter aerogenes, pseudomonas sp. and pseudomonas putida. several otus were identified most closely related to known food-borne pathogens, including bacillus cereus, cronobacter sakazaki, cronobacter turisensis, escherichia coli, e. coli o157:h7, hafnia alvei, kurthia gibsonii, salmonella bongori, salmonella enterica, salmonella paratyphi, salmonella tyhpi, salmonella typhimurium and yersinia enterocolitica ranging from 0.005% to 0.68% relative abundance. the condition and grade of the food premises on a three point cleanliness scale did not correlate with the bacterial abundance and type. regardless of the status and grades, all food premises have the same likelihood to introduce food-borne bacteria from cutting boards to their foods and must always prioritize the correct food handling procedure in order to avoid unwanted outbreak of food-borne illnesses.

TI  == effects of climate change on the persistence and dispersal of foodborne bacterial pathogens in the outdoor environment: a review.
AB  == abstract according to the intergovernmental panel on climate change (ipcc), warming of the climate system is unequivocal. over the coming century, warming trends such as increased duration and frequency of heat waves and hot extremes are expected in some areas, as well as increased intensity of some storm systems. climate-induced trends will impact the persistence and dispersal of foodborne pathogens in myriad ways, especially for environmentally ubiquitous and/or zoonotic microorganisms. animal hosts of foodborne pathogens are also expected to be impacted by climate change through the introduction of increased physiological stress and, in some cases, altered geographic ranges and seasonality. this review article examines the effects of climatic factors, such as temperature, rainfall,  drought and wind, on the environmental dispersal and persistence of bacterial foodborne pathogens, namely, bacillus cereus, brucella, campylobacter, clostridium, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella, staphylococcus aureus, vibrio and yersinia enterocolitica. these relationships are then used to  predict how future climatic changes will impact the activity of these microorganisms in the outdoor environment and associated food safety issues. the  development of predictive models that quantify these complex relationships will also be discussed, as well as the potential impacts of climate change on transmission of foodborne disease from animal hosts.

TI  == multicenter evaluation of the biofire filmarray gastrointestinal panel for etiologic diagnosis of infectious gastroenteritis.
AB  == the appropriate treatment and control of infectious gastroenteritis depend on the ability to rapidly detect the wide range of etiologic agents associated with the  disease. clinical laboratories currently utilize an array of different methodologies to test for bacterial, parasitic, and viral causes of gastroenteritis, a strategy that suffers from poor sensitivity, potentially long  turnaround times, and complicated ordering practices and workflows. additionally, there are limited or no testing methods routinely available for most diarrheagenic escherichia coli strains, astroviruses, and sapoviruses. this study assessed the performance of the filmarray gastrointestinal (gi) panel for the simultaneous detection of 22 different enteric pathogens directly from stool specimens: campylobacter spp., clostridium difficile (toxin a/b), plesiomonas shigelloides, salmonella spp., vibrio spp., vibrio cholerae, yersinia enterocolitica, enteroaggregative e. coli, enteropathogenic e. coli, enterotoxigenic e. coli, shiga-like toxin-producing e. coli (stx1 and stx2) (including specific detection of e. coli o157), shigella spp./enteroinvasive e. coli, cryptosporidium spp., cyclospora cayetanensis, entamoeba histolytica, giardia lamblia, adenovirus f 40/41, astrovirus, norovirus gi/gii, rotavirus a, and sapovirus. prospectively collected stool specimens (n = 1,556) were evaluated using the biofire filmarray gi panel and tested with conventional stool culture and molecular methods for comparison. the filmarray gi panel sensitivity was 100% for 12/22 targets and >/=94.5% for an additional 7/22 targets. for the remaining  three targets, sensitivity could not be calculated due to the low prevalences in  this study. the filmarray gi panel specificity was >/=97.1% for all panel targets. the filmarray gi panel provides a comprehensive, rapid, and streamlined  alternative to conventional methods for the etiologic diagnosis of infectious gastroenteritis in the laboratory setting. the potential advantages include improved performance parameters, a more extensive menu of pathogens, and a turnaround time of as short as 1 h.

TI  == detection of major diarrheagenic bacterial pathogens by multiplex pcr panels.
AB  == diarrheal diseases remain a major threat to the youngest population in low- and middle-income countries. the main bacterial pathogens causing diarrhea are diarrheagenic escherichia coli (dec) that consists of enteroaggregative (eaec), enteropathogenic (epec), enterotoxigenic (etec), enterohemorrhagic ehec and enteroinvasive e. coli (eiec), salmonella, shigella spp. (s. dysenteria, s. sonnei, s. flexneri) campylobacter (c. coli, c. jejuni), vibrio (v. vulnificus, v. parahaemolyticusm, v. cholerae), yersinia enterocolitica and aeromonas hydrophila. the aim of this study was to set up rapid multiplex pcr (mpcr) panels to identify these diarrheagenic pathogens based on their specific virulence genes. primers against specific target genes were combined into three mpcr panels: one for diarrheal e. coli, one for pathogens causing mainly bloody diarrhea, and the third for the remaining pathogens. the panels were tested against a set of stool samples from swedish children with diarrhea and controls and the analysis identified bacterial pathogens in 14/54 (26%) of the samples. these results show that our three developed mpcr panels can detect main bacterial diarrheagenic pathogens in clinical samples.

TI  == impact of aeromonas and diarrheagenic escherichia coli screening in patients with diarrhea in parana, southern brazil.
AB  == introduction: a wide diversity of bacterial agents may cause diarrhea, presenting challenges to clinical laboratories to define a diagnosis. considering that most  stool cultures are negative, we screened stool samples from patients with diarrhea for the presence of 14 bacterial enteropathogens, aiming to establish which of them should be included in routine stool analysis. methodology: stool samples from 400 patients with diarrhea were analyzed for the presence of salmonella, shigella, campylobacter, aeromonas, plesiomonas shigelloides, vibrio, yersinia enterocolitica, and diarrheagenic escherichia coli using conventional microbiological methods and pcr. two distinct samples were studied; one included  predominantly patients involved in outbreaks, and the other patients of low socioeconomic status presenting sporadic cases of diarrhea. results: in total, 86 cultures (21.5%) were positive. mixed infections were found in five patients, leading to recovery of 91 strains of enteropathogenic bacteria: salmonella enteritidis (9.2%), aeromonas (7.2%), diarrheagenic e. coli (5.2%), and c. jejuni (1%). however, salmonella predominated, with 11.5% frequency in diarrhea outbreaks, while aeromonas predominated among patients of low socioeconomic status, with 14.6% frequency. conclusion: aeromonas and diarrheagenic e. coli, which are not routinely screened for, deserve to be included in laboratory screening panels.

TI  == antimicrobial efficacy and in vivo toxicity studies of a quaternized biopolymeric flocculant.
AB  == this study evaluated the antibacterial spectrum and safety of a chemically modified biopolymeric flocculant (tmb) against waterborne pathogens. the biopolymer previously characterized as polysaccharide with flocculating activity  is produced extracellularly by the bacterium klebsiella terrigena. the amino sugars on the polymer were chemically modified by quaternization, which resulted  in n,n,n trimethyl biopolymer (tmb). quaternization was effective in imparting biocidal activity to tmb against five selected waterborne pathogens, namely, aeromonas hydrophila, yersinia enterocolitica, salmonella typhimurium, listeria monocytogenes and escherichia coli o157:h7. 99.999% inactivation was achieved with s. typhimurium at a dose of 60 mug ml(-1) of tmb within 60 min at the ambient temperature, followed by other pathogens. haemotological, histopathological and general examinations indicated no adverse effects in swiss  albino mice fed with the quaternized biopolymer (120 mg kg(-1) body weight(-1) day(-1)) over a period of 30 days. these results suggested that tmb was tolerated well without any signs of toxicity and may have potential application as a safe,  antimicrobial bioflocculant for both removing and inactivating waterborne pathogens.

TI  == absence of ybey rnase compromises the growth and enhances the virulence plasmid gene expression of yersinia enterocolitica o:3.
AB  == ybey was recently recognized as an endoribonuclease playing a role in ribosome biosynthesis. in escherichia coli it functions as a single-strand-specific rnase  that processes the 3' end of the 16s rrna and is crucial for the late-stage 70s ribosome quality control system. here we report that ybey is not essential in yersinia enterocolitica serotype o:3, yet its absence strongly compromised the bacterium. the lack of ybey resulted in misprocessing of 16s rrna and a severe decrease of growth rate with complete growth arrest observed at elevated temperatures. moreover, a ybey mutation severely disturbed regulation of the yersinia virulence plasmid (pyv) genes and affected the expression of regulatory  small rna species. transcription of the pyv genes was upregulated in the ybey mutant at 22 degrees c; the same genes were repressed in the wild-type bacterium. furthermore, ybey inactivation impaired many virulence-related features, such as  resistance to elevated temperature and acid, and hindered utilization of different carbohydrates. in addition, the ybey mutant strain showed decreased infectivity in a tissue culture infection model, especially at the stage of cell  adhesion. taken together, this study demonstrates the crucial role of ybey in y.  enterocolitica o:3 physiology and pathogenicity.

TI  == a new series of antibacterial nitrosopyrimidines: synthesis and structure-activity relationship.
AB  == new nitrosopyrimidines were synthesized and evaluated as potential antibacterial  agents. different compounds structurally related with 4,6-bis(alkyl or arylamino)-5-nitrosopyrimidines were evaluated. some of these nitrosopyrimidines  displayed significant antibacterial activity against human pathogenic bacteria. among them compounds 1c, 2a-c, and 9a-c exhibited remarkable activity against methicillin-sensitive and -resistant staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, yersinia enterocolitica, and salmonella enteritidis. a detailed structure-activity relationship study, supported by theoretical calculations, aided us to identify and understand the minimal structural requirements for the antibacterial action of the nitrosopyrimidines reported here. thus, our results have led us to identify a topographical template that provides a guide for the design of new nitrosopyrimidines with antibacterial effects.

TI  == aerobic bacterial microbiota isolated from the cloaca of the european pond turtle (emys orbicularis) in poland.
AB  == we conducted a comparative analysis of the aerobic cloacal bacteria of european pond turtles (emys orbicularis) living in their natural environment and juvenile  turtles reared under controlled conditions in a breeding center. we included 130  turtles in the study. the aerobic bacteria isolated from the cloaca of the juvenile turtles were less diverse and more prevalent than the bacteria isolated  from free-living adults. we isolated 17 bacterial species from juvenile captive turtles, among which the dominant species were cellulomonas flavigena (77/96), enterococcus faecalis (96/96), escherichia coli (58/96), and proteus mirabilis (41/96). from the adult, free-living turtles, we isolated 36 bacterial species, some of which are a potential threat to public health (e.g., salmonella enterica  serovars newport, daytona, and braenderup; listeria monocytogenes; yersinia enterocolitica; yersinia ruckeri; klebsiella pneumoniae; vibrio fluvialis; and serratia marcescens), and pathogens that are etiologic agents of diseases of ectothermic animals (e.g., aeromonas sobria, aeromonas caviae, hafnia alvei, edwardsiella tarda, and citrobacter braakii; the last two species were isolated from both groups of animals). the cloacal bacterial biota of the european pond turtle was characterized by numerous species of bacteria, and its composition varied with turtle age and environmental conditions. the small number of isolated bacteria that are potential human pathogens may indicate that the european pond turtle is of relatively minor importance as a threat to public health.

TI  == synthesis, characterization and antibacterial activity of biodegradable films prepared from schiff bases of zein.
AB  == pure zein is known to be very hydrophobic, but is still inappropriate for coating and film applications because of their brittle nature. in an attempt to improve the flexibility and the antimicrobial activity of these coatings and films, chemical modification of zein through forming schiff bases with different phenolic aldhydes was tried. influence of this modifications on mechanical, topographical, wetting properties and antimicrobial activity of zein films were evaluated. the chemical structure of the schiff bases films were characterized by atr-ftir spectroscopy. the results indicate an improvement in mechanical properties with chemically modification of zein to form schiff bases leading to a reduction in the elastic modulus. an increase in the elongation at break has been observed, but with slight influence on tensile strength. plasticized zein films have similar initial contact angle ( approximately 40 degrees ). an increase in reaction temperature and time increases film's affinity towards water. as shown by contact angle measurements, a noticeable relation was found between film composition and the hydrophilicity. surface topography also varied by forming schiff bases, becoming rougher than zein-based films. the antibacterial activities of zein and schiff bases of zein-based films were investigated against gram-positive bacteria (listeria innocua, listeria monocytogenes, bacillus cereus and clostridium sporogenes) and gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, yersinia enterocolitica and salmonella enterica). it was found that the antibacterial activity of the schiff bases-based films was more effective than that of zein-based films.

TI  == pathogenic enterobacteria in lemurs associated with anthropogenic disturbance.
AB  == as human population density continues to increase exponentially, speeding the reduction and fragmentation of primate habitat, greater human-primate contact is  inevitable, making higher rates of pathogen transmission likely. anthropogenic effects are particularly evident in madagascar, where a diversity of endemic lemur species are threatened by rapid habitat loss. despite these risks, knowledge of how anthropogenic activities affect lemur exposure to pathogens is limited. to improve our understanding of this interplay, we non-invasively examined six species of wild lemurs in ranomafana national park for enteric bacterial pathogens commonly associated with diarrheal disease in human populations in madagascar. patterns of infection with enterotoxigenic escherichia coli, shigella spp., salmonella enterica, vibrio cholerae, and yersinia spp. (enterocolitica and pseudotuberculosis) were compared between lemurs inhabiting intact forest and lemurs inhabiting degraded habitat with frequent exposure to tourism and other human activity. fecal samples acquired from humans, livestock,  and rodents living near the degraded habitat were also screened for these bacteria. remarkably, only lemurs living in disturbed areas of the park tested positive for these pathogens. moreover, all of these pathogens were present in the human, livestock, and/or rodent populations. these data suggest that lemurs residing in forests altered or frequented by people, livestock, or peridomestic rodents, are at risk for infection by these diarrhea-causing enterobacteria and other similarly transmitted pathogens.

TI  == evaluation of a real-time multiplex pcr for the simultaneous detection of campylobacter jejuni, salmonella spp., shigella spp./eiec, and yersinia enterocolitica in fecal samples.
AB  == conventional diagnosis of infectious diarrhea caused by bacteria is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and has a suboptimal sensitivity. we have therefore developed a multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) for the simultaneous detection of campylobacter jejuni, salmonella spp., shigella spp./enteroinvasive escherichia coli (eiec), and yersinia enterocolitica in fecal samples. no cross reactivity between the different pathogens was observed, and the multiplex setup of the assay did not have an impact on the sensitivity of the pcr. the analytical sensitivity was 87 cfu/ml for c. jejuni, 61 cfu/ml for shigella spp./eiec, 5,528 cfu/ml for salmonella spp., and 1,306 cfu/ml for y. enterocolitica. an extensive validation of the assay was performed by testing 1,687 patient samples by both pcr and with conventional techniques. the use of pcr increased the overall clinical sensitivity from 78 to 100 % (p < 0.0001), the specificity was 99.4 % for the pcr, compared with 99.9 % for conventional culture. the novel pcr assay allows for rapid, sensitive, inexpensive, and high-throughput testing of the most common bacterial causes of gastroenteritis.

TI  == expanding the results of a high throughput screen against an isochorismate-pyruvate lyase to enzymes of a similar scaffold or mechanism.
AB  == antibiotic resistance is a growing health concern, and new avenues of antimicrobial drug design are being actively sought. one suggested pathway to be  targeted for inhibitor design is that of iron scavenging through siderophores. here we present a high throughput screen to the isochorismate-pyruvate lyase of pseudomonas aeruginosa, an enzyme required for the production of the siderophore  pyochelin. compounds identified in the screen are high nanomolar to low micromolar inhibitors of the enzyme and produce growth inhibition in pao1 p. aeruginosa in the millimolar range under iron-limiting conditions. the identified compounds were also tested for enzymatic inhibition of escherichia coli chorismate mutase, a protein of similar fold and similar chemistry, and of yersinia enterocolitica salicylate synthase, a protein of differing fold but catalyzing the same lyase reaction. in both cases, subsets of the inhibitors from the screen were found to be inhibitory to enzymatic activity (mutase or synthase) in the micromolar range and capable of growth inhibition in their respective organisms (e. coli or y. enterocolitica).

TI  == prevalence and characterization of foodborne pathogens from australian dairy farm environments.
AB  == the ability of foodborne pathogens to gain entry into food supply systems remains an ongoing concern. in dairy products, raw milk acts as a major vehicle for this  transfer; however, the sources of pathogenic bacteria that contaminate raw milk are often not clear, and environmental sources of contamination or the animals themselves may contribute to the transfer. this survey examined the occurrence of 9 foodborne pathogens in raw milk and environments of 7 dairy farms (3 bovine, 3  caprine, and 1 ovine farm) in summer and autumn, in victoria, australia. a total  of 120 samples were taken from sampling points common to dairy farms, including pasture, soil, feed, water sources, animal feces, raw milk, and milk filters. the prevalence of the bacillus cereus group, campylobacter, clostridium perfringens,  cronobacter, shiga-toxigenic escherichia coli, listeria, salmonella, coagulase-positive staphylococci (cps), and yersinia enterocolitica across the farms was investigated. the 2 most prevalent bacteria, which were detected on all farms, were the b. cereus group, isolated from 41% of samples, followed by cl. perfringens, which was isolated from 38% of samples. the highest occurrence of any pathogen was the b. cereus group in soil, present in 93% of samples tested. fecal samples showed the highest diversity of pathogens, containing 7 of the 9 pathogens tested. salmonella was isolated from 1 bovine farm, although it was found in multiple samples on both visits. out of the 14 occurrences where any pathogen was detected in milk filters, only 5 (36%) of the corresponding raw milk samples collected at the same time were positive for the same pathogen. all of the cps were staphylococcus aureus, and were found in raw milk or milk filter samples from 6 of the 7 farms, but not in other sample types. pathogenic listeria species were detected on 3 of the 7 farms, and included 4 l. ivanovii-positive samples, and 1 l. monocytogenes-positive water sample. shiga-toxigenic escherichia coli were identified in fecal samples from 3 of the 7 farms and in a  single raw milk sample. cronobacter species were identified on 4 of the 7 farms,  predominantly in feed samples. no y. enterocolitica was detected. results of this study demonstrate high standards of pathogen safety across the 7 farms, with a low incidence of pathogens detected in raw milk samples. monitoring feed contamination levels may help control the spread of bacterial species such as cl. perfringens and b. cereus through the farm environment, which is a natural reservoir for these organisms.

TI  == detection and characterization of shiga toxin producing escherichia coli, salmonella spp., and yersinia strains from human, animal, and food samples in san luis, argentina.
AB  == shiga toxin producing escherichia coli (stec), salmonella spp., and yersinia species was investigated in humans, animals, and foods in san luis, argentina. a  total of 453 samples were analyzed by culture and pcr. the antimicrobial susceptibility of all the strains was studied, the genomic relationships among isolates of the same species were determined by pfge, and the potencial virulence of y. enterocolitica strains was analyzed. yersinia species showed higher prevalence (9/453, 2.0%, 95% ci, 0.7-3.3%) than stec (4/453, 0.9%, 95% ci, 0-1.8%) and salmonella spp. (3/453, 0.7%, 95% ci, 0-1.5%). y. enterocolitica and  y. intermedia were isolated from chicken carcasses (6/80, 7.5%, 95% ci, 1.5-13.5%) and porcine skin and bones (3/10, 30%, 95% ci, 0-65%). one stec strain was recovered from human feces (1/70, 1.4%, 95% ci, 0-4.2%) and stec stx1/stx2 genes were detected in bovine stools (3/129, 2.3%, 95% ci, 0-5.0%). s. typhimurium was isolated from human feces (1/70, 1.4%, 95% ci, 0-4.2%) while one  s. newport and two s. gaminara strains were recovered from one wild boar (1/3, 33%, 95% ci, 0-99%). the knowledge of prevalence and characteristics of these enteropathogens in our region would allow public health services to take adequate preventive measures.

TI  == epidemiology of pathogenic enterobacteria in humans, livestock, and peridomestic  rodents in rural madagascar.
AB  == background: among the families of enteric bacteria are globally important diarrheal agents. despite their potential for zoonotic and environmental transmission, few studies have examined the epidemiology of these pathogens in rural systems characterized by extensive overlap among humans, domesticated and peridomestic animals. we investigated patterns of infection with enterotoxigenic  escherichia coli, shigella spp., salmonella enterica, vibrio cholerae, and yersinia spp. (enterocolitica, and pseudotuberculosis) in southeastern madagascar where the potential for the aforementioned interactions is high. in this pilot project we conducted surveys to examine behaviors potentially associated with risk of infection and if infection with specific enterobacteria species was associated with diarrheal disease. methodology/principal findings: pcr was conducted on dna from human, livestock, and rodent fecal samples from three villages. overall, human prevalence was highest (77%), followed by rodents (51%)  and livestock (18%). rodents were approximately 2.8 times more likely than livestock to carry one of the bacteria. the incidence of individual species varied between villages, with the observation that, e. coli and shigella spp. were consistently associated with co-infections. as an aggregate, there was a significant risk of infection linked to a water source in one village. individually, different pathogens were associated with certain behaviors, including: those who had used medication, experienced diarrhea in the past four weeks, or do not use toilets. conclusions/significance: different bacteria were associated with an elevated risk of infection for various human activities or characteristics. certain bacteria may also predispose people to co-infections. these data suggest that a high potential for transmission among these groups, either directly or via contaminated water sources. as these bacteria were most prevalent in humans, it is possible that they are maintained in humans and that transmission to other species is infrequent. further studies are needed to understand bacterial persistence, transmission dynamics, and associated consequences in this and similar systems.

TI  == antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungal properties of wines and winery byproducts in relation to their flavonoid content.
AB  == grapes produce organic compounds that may be involved in the defense of the plants against invading phytopathogens. these metabolites include numerous phenolic compounds that are also active against human pathogens. grapes are used  to produce a variety of wines, grape juices, and raisins. grape pomace, seeds, and skins, the remains of the grapes that are a byproduct of winemaking, also contain numerous bioactive compounds that differ from those found in grapes and wines. this overview surveys and interprets our present knowledge of the activities of wines and winery byproducts and some of their bioactive components  against foodborne (bacillus cereus, campylobacter jejuni, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella enterica, staphylococcus aureus, yersinia enterocolitica, vibrio cholerae, vibrio vulnificus), medical (helicobacter pylori, klebsiella pneumoniae), and oral pathogenic bacteria, viruses (adeno, cytomegalo, hepatitis, noro, rota), fungi (candida albicans, botrytis cinerea), parasites (eimeria tenella, trichomonas vaginalis), and microbial toxins (ochratoxin a, shiga toxin) in culture, in vivo, and in/on food (beef, chicken, frankfurters, hot dogs, lettuce, oysters, peppers, pork, sausages, soup, spinach) in relation to composition and sensory properties. also covered are antimicrobial wine marinades, antioxidative and immunostimulating aspects, and adverse effects  associated with wine consumption. the collated information and suggested research needs might facilitate and guide further studies needed to optimize the use of wines and byproducts to help improve microbial food safety and prevent or treat animal and human infections.

TI  == immunoproteomics of brucella abortus rb51 as candidate antigens in serological diagnosis of brucellosis.
AB  == the current brucellosis serodiagnostic assays are chiefly based on detecting anti-lps (lipopolysaccharide) antibodies. however, cross-reaction with some gram-negative bacteria can occasionally induce due to similar o-polysaccharide (ops) structure. therefore, the aim of the present study was to identify new candidate antigens from brucella abortus rb51, a mutant strain lacking the lps portion, which might be valuable in brucellosis diagnosis. to detect potential antigens, immobilized ph gradients (ipg) strips with three ranges (ph 3-5.6, 4-7  and 6-11) were applied. after separating the insoluble proteins of b. abortus rb51 using two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-de), their immunogenicity was evaluated by western blotting using four types of antisera - b. abortus, yersinia enterocolitica o:9 and escherichia coli o157:h7-positive, and b. abortus-negative bovine sera. among the several immunogenic spots, the spots showing specific reactivity with only the b. abortus-positive antisera, were considered as candidate antigens. overall, eleven immuno-reactive proteins were identified, as  follows: cu/zn superoxide dismutase, histidinol dehydrogenase, chaperonin dnak, chaperonin groes, beta-ketoadipyl coa thiolase, two-component response regulator, the cell-division protein ftsz, aldehyde dehydrogenase, 50s ribosomal protein l10 and invasion protein b. these selected highly immunogenic protein spots might be  useful as alternative antigens for brucellosis and helpful in reducing the cross-reactivity.

TI  == green conversion of agroindustrial wastes into chitin and chitosan by rhizopus arrhizus and cunninghamella elegans strains.
AB  == this article sets out a method for producing chitin and chitosan by cunninghamella elegans and rhizopus arrhizus strains using a green metabolic conversion of agroindustrial wastes (corn steep liquor and molasses). the physicochemical characteristics of the biopolymers and antimicrobial activity are described. chitin and chitosan were extracted by alkali-acid treatment, and characterized by infrared spectroscopy, viscosity and x-ray diffraction. the effectiveness of chitosan from c. elegans and r. arrhizus in inhibiting the growth of listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa,  salmonella enterica, escherichia coli and yersinia enterocolitica were evaluated  by determining the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) and the minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbc). the highest production of biomass (24.60 g/l), chitin (83.20 mg/g) and chitosan (49.31 mg/g) was obtained by r. arrhizus. chitin and chitosan from both fungi showed a similar degree of deacetylation, respectively of 25% and 82%, crystallinity indices of 33.80% and 32.80% for chitin, and 20.30% and 17.80% for chitosan. both chitin and chitosan presented similar viscosimetry of 3.79-3.40 cp and low molecular weight of 5.08x10(3) and 4.68x10(3) g/mol. they both showed identical mic and mbc for all bacteria assayed. these results suggest that: agricultural wastes can be produced in an environmentally friendly way; chitin and chitosan can be produced economically; and that chitosan has antimicrobial potential against pathogenic bacteria.

TI  == rabbit monoclonal antibodies directed at the t3ss effector protein yopm identify  human pathogenic yersinia isolates.
AB  == the yersinia outer protein m (yopm) is a type 3 secretion system (t3ss)-dependent effector protein of yersinia enterocolitica, yersinia pseudotuberculosis and yersinia pestis. although yopm is indispensable for full virulence, its molecular functions still remain largely elusive. recently, we could identify the recombinant yopm (ryopm) protein derived from the y. enterocolitica strain 8081 (jb580) as a cell-penetrating protein, which down-regulates the expression of various pro-inflammatory cytokines including tnfalpha. in this study, we have generated rabbit monoclonal anti-yopm antibodies (rabmabs). rabmabs were characterized by sds-page and western blotting using various truncated versions of ryopm to identify epitope-containing domains. rabmabs recognizing either the n- or c-terminus of yopm were characterized further and validated using a collection of 61 pathogenic and non-pathogenic yersinia strains as well as exemplary strains of major intestinal bacterial pathogens such as salmonella enterica ssp. enterica, shigella flexneri and intestinal pathogenic escherichia coli. rabmab 41.3 directed at the n-terminus of yopm of y. enterocolitica strain  8081 recognized all yopm-expressing pathogenic yersinia strains analyzed in this  study but failed to recognize non-pathogenic isolates. thus, rabmab 41.3 might be applicable for the detection of pathogenic yersinia strains.

TI  == preparation and antimicrobial action of three tryptic digested functional molecules of bovine lactoferrin.
AB  == lactoferrin is an 80 kda bilobal, iron binding glycoprotein which is primarily antimicrobial in nature. the hydrolysis of lactoferrin by various proteases in the gut produces several functional fragments of lactoferrin which have varying molecular sizes and properties. here, bovine lactoferrin has been hydrolyzed by trypsin, the major enzyme present in the gut, to produce three functional molecules of sizes approximately 21 kda, 38 kda and 45 kda. the molecules have been purified using ion exchange and gel filtration chromatography and identified using n-terminal sequencing, which reveals that while the 21 kda molecule corresponds to the n2 domain (21lf), the 38 kda represents the whole c-lobe (38lf) and the 45 kda is a portion of n1 domain of n-lobe attached to the c-lobe  (45lf). the iron binding and release properties of 21lf, 38lf and 45lf have been  studied and compared. the sequence and structure analysis of the portions of the  excision sites of lf from various species have been done. the antibacterial properties of these three molecules against bacterial strains, streptococcus pyogenes, escherichia coli, yersinia enterocolitica and listeria monocytogenes were investigated. the antifungal action of the molecules was also evaluated against candida albicans. this is the first report on the antimicrobial actions of the trypsin cleaved functional molecules of lactoferrin from any species.

AB  == measures of disease burden such as quality-adjusted life years (qalys) are increasingly important to risk-based food safety policy. they provide a means of  comparing relative risk from diverse health outcomes. we present detailed disease-outcome trees and eq-5d scoring for 14 major foodborne pathogens representing over 95% of foodborne illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths due to specified agents in the united states (campylobacter spp., clostridium perfringens, cryptosporidium parvum, cyclospora cayetanensis, escherichia coli o157:h7, shiga toxin-producing e. coli non-o157, listeria monocytogenes, nontyphoidal salmonella enterica, shigella, toxoplasma gondii, vibrio vulnificus, vibrio parahaemolyticus and other noncholera vibrio, and yersinia enterocolitica). we estimate over 5800 qalys lost per 1000 cases of l. monocytogenes and v. vulnificus, compared to 125 qalys lost per 1000 cases of t.  gondii, 26 for e. coli o157:h7, 16 for salmonella and campylobacter, and 14 for y. enterocolitica. the remaining 7 pathogens are estimated to cause less than 5 qalys lost per 1000 cases. in total, these 14 pathogens cause over 61,000 in qaly loss annually, with more than 90% due solely to acute infection being responsible for 65% of total qaly loss, with premature mortality and morbidity due to chronic and congenital illness responsible for another 28%. these estimates of the burden of chronic sequelae are likely conservative; additional epidemiological research  is needed to support more accurate burden estimates. this study shows the value of using integrated metrics for comparing disease burden, and the need to consider chronic and congenital illness when prioritizing foodborne pathogens.

TI  == presence of salmonella spp., yersinia enterocolitica, yersinia pseudotuberculosis and escherichia coli o157:h7 in wild boars.
AB  == the european wild boar populations are growing and spreading to new areas, which  might constitute a threat to public health, since wild boar can harbour pathogens with the potential to cause serious illness in humans. tonsils, ileocaecal lymph  nodes and faecal samples were collected from 88 swedish wild boars and analysed for the presence of the zoonotic pathogens salmonella spp., yersinia enterocolitica, y. pseudotuberculosis and enterohaemorrhagic escherichia coli o157:h7 (ehec). a combination of cultivation and polymerase chain reaction (pcr)  analysis was used and overall, 20% of sampled individuals tested positive for y.  enterocolitica, 20% for y. pseudotuberculosis and 10% for salmonella spp. a total of 41% of sampled individuals tested positive for one or more of these three pathogens. no ehec were detected. samples pcr-positive for salmonella spp. were cultivated further and six isolates were obtained, belonging to salmonella enterica subspecies enterica and subspecies diarizone. the pathogens were most commonly detected in tonsil samples.

TI  == food-borne pathogens of animal origin-diagnosis, prevention, control and their zoonotic significance: a review.
AB  == the term food borne diseases or food-borne illnesses or more commonly food poisoning are used to denote gastrointestinal complications that occur following  recent consumption of a particular food or drink. millions of people suffer worldwide every year and the situation is quiet grave in developing nations creating social and economic strain. the food borne pathogens include various bacteria viz., salmonella, campylobacter, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, yersinia enterocolitica, staphylococcus, arcobacter, clostridium perfringens, cl. botulinum and bacillus cereus and helminths viz., taenia. they also include protozoa viz., trichinella, sarcocystis, toxoplasma gondii and cryptosporidium parvum. the zoonotic potential and the ability to elaborate toxins by many of the microbes causing fatal intoxication are sufficient to understand the seriousness of the situation. the viral agents being host specific their transmission to humans through food of animal origin is not yet confirmed although these animal viruses are similar to that of viruses infecting human. food-borne bacteria; protozoa and helminthes have complex distribution pattern in the environment and inside the host system. this along with complexity of the maintenance chain and life cycle (of parasites) has made it difficult for epidemiologist and diagnostician to undertake any immediate safety measures against them. serological and molecular diagnostic tests viz. elisa, latex agglutination test, lateral flow assays, immunomagnetic separation assays, molecular assays viz. polymerase chain reaction (pcr), multiplex pcr, immuno-pcr, realtime pcr, random amplified polymorphic dna (rapd)-pcr, dna microarrays and probes are widely used. along with these lamp assays, capillary electrophoresis-single strand confirmation polymorphism (ce-sscp); flow cytometry, fish, biosensors, direct epifluorescent filter technique, nanotechnology based methods and sophisticated tools (ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging and chlonangio-pancreatography) have aided in the diagnosis greatly. most of the food-borne illnesses are self-limiting but in many instances antibiotics are recommended. with the increased drug resistance however use of chicken immunoglobulin, bacteriophage therapy, probiotics and herbs are gaining much importance these days. adoption of proper prevention and control measures (including cooking procedures; hygiene, strict adherence to haccp principles, public awareness and disease surveillance and monitoring) are the need of hour. all these have been discussed vividly in this review to help epidemiologists, diagnosticians, clinicians and above all common people so as to enable them avoid negligence regarding such serious issue.

TI  == evaluation and functional characterization of a biosurfactant produced by lactobacillus plantarum cfr 2194.
AB  == the study details the investigations on the ability of lactobacillus plantarum cfr 2194, an isolate from kanjika, a rice-based ayurvedic fermented product, to produce biosurfactant. surfactant production, as a function of fermentation time, indicates that the maximum production occurred at 72 h under stationary conditions. isolation, partial purification, and characterization of the biosurfactant produced have been carried out, and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ftir) spectra demonstrated that biosurfactants were constituted by  protein and polysaccharide fractions, i.e., possessed the structure typical of glycoprotein, which is affected by the medium composition and the phase of growth of the biosurfactant-synthesizing strain. critical micelle concentration (cmc) of the biosurfactant was found to be 6 g l(-1). the emulsification index (ei), emulsification activity (ea), and emulsion stability (es) values of the biosurfactant have confirmed its emulsification property. aqueous fractions of the produced biosurfactant exhibited a significant antimicrobial activity against the food-borne pathogenic species: escherichia coli atcc 31705, e. coli mtcc 108, salmonella typhi, yersinia enterocolitica mtcc 859, and staphylococcus aureus f 722. more importantly, the biosurfactant from l. plantarum showed antiadhesive property against above food-borne pathogens. the results thus indicate the potential for developing strategies to prevent microbial colonization of food contact surfaces and health-care prosthesis using these biosurfactants.

TI  == probiotic characterization of potential hydrolases producing lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis isolated from pickled yam.
AB  == the aim of this study was to characterize potential probiotic strain co-producing alpha-amylase and beta-galactosidase. sixty-three strains, isolated from pickle samples were screened for their hydrolase producing capacity by utilizing different starches as carbon source. one out of 63 strains, isolated from traditionally fermented pickled yam showing maximum hydrolase activity (alpha-amylase (36.9 u/ml) and beta-galactosidase (42.6 u/ml)) within a period of 48 hours was identified as lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis. further, it was assessed for the probiotic characteristics under gastrointestinal conditions like acidic, alkaline, proteolytic enzymes, bile stress and found to exhibit tolerance to these stresses. the therapeutic potential of the isolate is implicated because of its antagonistic effect against enteric foodborne pathogens (salmonella typhimurium, escherichia coli 0157:h7, staphylococcus aureus, yersinia enterocolitica and aeromonas hydrophila). the results of this study entail a potential applicability of the isolate in developing future probiotic foods besides the production of industrially significant hydrolases.

TI  == yaxab, a yersinia enterocolitica pore-forming toxin regulated by rova.
AB  == the transcriptional regulator rova positively regulates transcription of the yersinia enterocolitica virulence gene inv. invasin, encoded by inv, is important for establishment of y. enterocolitica infection. however, a rova mutant is more  attenuated for virulence than an inv mutant, implying that rova regulates additional virulence genes. when the y. enterocolitica rova regulon was defined by microarray analysis, ye1984 and ye1985 were among the genes identified as being upregulated by rova. since these genes are homologous to xenorhabdus nematophila cytotoxin genes xaxa and xaxb, we named them yaxa and yaxb, respectively. in this work, we demonstrate the effects of yaxab on the course of  infection in the murine model. while a yaxab mutant (deltayaxab) is capable of colonizing mice at the same level as the wild type, it slightly delays the course of infection and results in differing pathology in the spleen. further, we found  that yaxab encode a probable cytotoxin capable of lysing mammalian cells, that both yaxa and yaxb are required for cytotoxic activity, and that the two proteins associate. yaxab-mediated cell death occurs via osmotic lysis through the formation of distinct membrane pores. in silico tertiary structural analysis identified predicted structural homology between yaxa and proteins in pore-forming toxin complexes from bacillus cereus (hbl-b) and escherichia coli (hlye). thus, it appears that yaxab function as virulence factors by inducing cell lysis through the formation of pores in the host cell membrane. this characterization of yaxab supports the hypothesis that rova regulates expression  of multiple virulence factors in y. enterocolitica.

TI  == the acyl-homoserine lactone synthase yeni from yersinia enterocolitica modulates  virulence gene expression in enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli o157:h7.
AB  == the human pathogen enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli (ehec) o157:h7 colonizes the rectoanal junction (raj) in cattle, its natural reservoir. colonization at the raj poses a serious risk for fecal shedding and contamination of the environment. we previously demonstrated that ehec senses acyl-homoserine lactones (ahls) produced by the microbiota in the rumen to activate the gad acid resistance genes necessary for survival through the acidic stomachs in cattle and to repress the locus of enterocyte effacement (lee) genes important for colonization of the raj, but unnecessary in the rumen. devoid of ahls, the raj is the prominent site of colonization of ehec in cattle. to determine if the presence of ahls in the raj could repress colonization at this site, we engineered ehec to express the yersinia enterocolitica ahl synthase gene yeni, which constitutively produces ahls, to mimic a constant exposure of ahls in the environment. the yeni(+) ehec produces oxo-c6-homoserine lactone (oxo-c6-hsl) and had a significant reduction in lee expression, effector protein secretion, and attaching and effacing (a/e) lesion formation in vitro compared to the wild type  (wt). the yeni(+) ehec also activated expression of the gad genes. to assess whether ahl production, which decreases lee expression, would decrease raj colonization by ehec, cattle were challenged at the raj with wt or yeni(+) ehec.  although the yeni(+) ehec colonized the raj with efficiency equal to that of the  wt, there was a trend for the cattle to shed the wt strain longer than the yeni(+) ehec.

TI  == lysine221 is the general base residue of the isochorismate synthase from pseudomonas aeruginosa (pcha) in a reaction that is diffusion limited.
AB  == the isochorismate synthase from pseudomonas aeruginosa (pcha) catalyzes the conversion of chorismate to isochorismate, which is subsequently converted by a second enzyme (pchb) to salicylate for incorporation into the salicylate-capped siderophore pyochelin. pcha is a member of the mst family of enzymes, which includes the structurally homologous isochorismate synthases from escherichia coli (entc and menf) and salicylate synthases from yersinia enterocolitica (irp9) and mycobacterium tuberculosis (mbti). the latter enzymes generate isochorismate  as an intermediate before generating salicylate and pyruvate. general acid-general base catalysis has been proposed for isochorismate synthesis in all  five enzymes, but the residues required for the isomerization are a matter of debate, with both lysine221 and glutamate313 proposed as the general base (pcha numbering). this work includes a classical characterization of pcha with steady state kinetic analysis, solvent kinetic isotope effect analysis and by measuring  the effect of viscosogens on catalysis. the results suggest that isochorismate production from chorismate by the mst enzymes is the result of general acid-general base catalysis with a lysine as the base and a glutamic acid as the  acid, in reverse protonation states. chemistry is determined to not be rate limiting, favoring the hypothesis of a conformational or binding step as the slow step.

TI  == [infectious etiology of acute idiopathic intussusception in children].
AB  == the intussusception (iia) is an invagination of the immediate part of the intestine. she is responsible for a syndrome with an occlusive venous compression and swelling that can rapidly progress to intestinal necrosis. most cases occur in children aged 6 to 18 months and occur more frequently in boys than girls. there are two types of iia: the iia idiopathic representing 90-95% of invaginations of the child and the iia secondary to local injury of the gastrointestinal tract or occurring in a particular context whose frequency are between 5 and 10%. the pathogenesis of the iia remains uncertain, but the infectious origin is criminalized in most idiopathic invaginations. this component is dominated by viral agents including adenovirus, rotavirus, enterovirus, human herpesvirus 6 and 7, cytomegalovirus and epstein-barrvirus. bacterial agents are rather found and include yersinia enterocolitica, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli o157, h7, salmonella and campylobacter. in a small proportion parasitic agents may be reported in the iia, the most frequently found are entamoeba histolytica, trichuris trichuira, ascaris lumbricoides, ankylostoma and giardia.

AB  == objective: to assess antimicrobial resistance and transfer of virulence genes facilitated by subtherapeutic concentrations of antimicrobials in swine intestines. animals: 20 anesthetized pigs experimentally inoculated with donor and recipient bacteria. procedures: 4 recipient pathogenic bacteria (salmonella enterica serotype typhimurium, yersinia enterocolitica, shigella flexneri, or proteus mirabilis) were incubated with donor bacteria in the presence of subinhibitory concentrations of 1 of 16 antimicrobials in isolated ligated intestinal loops in swine. donor escherichia coli contained transferrable antimicrobial resistance or virulence genes. after coincubations, intestinal contents were removed and assessed for pathogens that acquired new antimicrobial  resistance or virulence genes following exposure to the subtherapeutic concentrations of antimicrobials. results: 3 antimicrobials (apramycin, lincomycin, and neomycin) enhanced transfer of an antimicrobial resistance plasmid from commensal e coli organisms to yersinia and proteus organisms, whereas 7 antimicrobials (florfenicol, hygromycin, penicillin g, roxarsone, sulfamethazine, tetracycline, and tylosin) exacerbated transfer of an integron (salmonella genomic island 1) from salmonella organisms to yersinia organisms. sulfamethazine induced the transfer of salmonella pathogenicity island 1 from pathogenic to nonpathogenic salmonella organisms. six antimicrobials (bacitracin, carbadox, erythromycin, sulfathiazole, tiamulin, and virginiamycin) did not mediate any transfer events. sulfamethazine was the only antimicrobial implicated in 2 types of transfer events. conclusions and clinical relevance: 10 of 16 antimicrobials at subinhibitory or subtherapeutic concentrations augmented specific antimicrobial resistance or transfer of virulence genes into pathogenic  bacteria in isolated intestinal loops in swine. use of subtherapeutic antimicrobials in animal feed may be associated with unwanted collateral effects.

TI  == limitations of the bp26 protein-based indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay  for diagnosis of brucellosis.
AB  == brucellosis is a serious zoonosis that occurs worldwide, and its diagnosis is typically based on the detection of antibodies against brucella lipopolysaccharide (lps). however, the specificity of the lps-based test is compromised by cross-reactivity with escherichia coli o157:h7 and yersinia enterocolitica o:9. also, diagnosis based on the lps test cannot differentiate between vaccinated and infected individuals. the detection of the 26-kda cytosoluble protein (bp26) antibody is considered an alternative that circumvents these drawbacks because it is exclusively expressed by infectious brucella. a bp26-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) has been tried for the diagnosis of brucella-infected animals and humans, but a few results showed that  bp26 couldn't react with all brucella-positive sera. in order to explore whether  different animals could produce antibodies against bp26 after being infected with various brucella species, we infected sheep, goats, and beef cattle with common virulent reference brucella species. all sera were collected from the experimental animals and tested using both lps-based elisas and bp26-based elisas. the results showed that all brucella-infected individuals could produce high levels of antibodies against lps, but only b. melitensis 16m- and b. melitensis m28-infected sheep and b. melitensis 16m- and b. abortus 2308-infected goats could produce antibodies against bp26. therefore, we concluded that the bp26-based indirect elisa (i-elisa) showed both brucella species and host specificity, which obviously limits its reliability as a substitute for the traditional lps-based elisa for the detection of brucellosis.

AB  == acute diarrheal disease (add) can be caused by a range of pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, and parasites. conventional diagnostic methods, such as culture, microscopy, biochemical assays, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (elisa), are laborious and time-consuming and lack sensitivity. combined, the array of tests performed on a single specimen can increase the turnaround time (tat) significantly. we validated a 19plex laboratory-developed gastrointestinal  pathogen panel (gpp) using luminex xtag analyte-specific reagents (asrs) to simultaneously screen directly in fecal specimens for diarrhea-causing pathogens, including bacteria (campylobacter jejuni, salmonella spp., shigella spp., enterotoxigenic escherichia coli [etec], shiga toxin-producing e. coli [stec], e. coli o157:h7, vibrio cholerae, yersinia enterocolitica, and toxigenic clostridium difficile), parasites (giardia lamblia, cryptosporidium spp., and entamoeba histolytica), and viruses (norovirus gi and gii, adenovirus 40/41, and rotavirus  a). performance characteristics of gpp asrs were determined using 48 reference isolates and 254 clinical specimens. stool specimens from individuals with diarrhea were tested for pathogens using conventional and molecular methods. using the predictive methods as standards, the sensitivities of the gpp asrs were 100% for adenovirus 40/41, norovirus, rotavirus a, vibrio cholerae, yersinia enterocolitica, entamoeba histolytica, cryptosporidium spp., and e. coli o157:h7; 95% for giardia lamblia; 94% for etec and stec; 93% for shigella spp.; 92% for salmonella spp.; 91% for c. difficile a/b toxins; and 90% for campylobacter jejuni. the overall comparative performance of the gpp asrs with conventional methods in clinical samples was 94.5% (range, 90% to 97%), with 99% (99.0% to 99.9%) specificity. implementation of the gpp asrs enables our public health laboratory to offer highly sensitive and specific screening and identification of the major add-causing pathogens.

TI  == biosynthesis of udp-glcnac, undpp-glcnac and udp-glcnaca involves three easily distinguished 4-epimerase enzymes, gne, gnu and gnab.
AB  == we have undertaken an extensive survey of a group of epimerases originally named  gne, that were thought to be responsible for inter-conversion of udp-n-acetylglucosamine (udp-glcnac) and udp-n-acetylgalactosamine (udp-galnac).  the analysis builds on recent work clarifying the specificity of some of these epimerases. we find three well defined clades responsible for inter-conversion of the gluco- and galacto-configuration at c4 of different n-acetylhexosamines. their major biological roles are the formation of udp-galnac, udp-n-acetylgalactosaminuronic acid (udp-galnaca) and undecaprenyl pyrophosphate-n-acetylgalactosamine (undpp-galnac) from the corresponding glucose forms. we propose that the clade of udp-glcnaca epimerase genes be named gnab and the clade of undpp-glcnac epimerase genes be named gnu, while the udp-glcnac epimerase genes retain the name gne. the gne epimerases, as now defined after exclusion of those to be named gnab or gnu, are in the same clade as the gale 4-epimerases for inter-conversion of udp-glucose (udp-glc) and udp-galactose (udp-gal). this work brings clarity to an area that had become quite confusing. the identification of distinct enzymes for epimerisation of udp-glcnac, udp-glcnaca and undpp-glcnac will greatly facilitate allocation of gene function  in polysaccharide gene clusters, including those found in bacterial genome sequences. a table of the accession numbers for the 295 proteins used in the analysis is provided to enable the major tree to be regenerated with the inclusion of additional proteins of interest. this and other suggestions for annotation of 4-epimerase genes will facilitate annotation.

TI  == detection, distribution and characterization of novel superoxide dismutases from  yersinia enterocolitica biovar 1a.
AB  == background: superoxide dismutases (sods) cause dismutation of superoxide radicals to hydrogen peroxide and oxygen. besides protecting the cells against oxidative damage by endogenously generated oxygen radicals, sods play an important role in  intraphagocytic survival of pathogenic bacteria. the complete genome sequences of yersinia enterocolitica strains show presence of three different sod genes. however, not much is known about the types of sods present in y. enterocolitica,  their characteristics and role in virulence and intraphagocytic survival of this  organism. methodology/principal findings: this study reports detection and distribution of the three superoxide dismutase (soda, sodb and sodc) genes in 59  strains of y. enterocolitica and related species. the majority (94%) of the strains carried all three genes and constitutive expression of soda and sodb was  detected in 88% of the strains. expression of sodc was not observed in any of the strains. the soda, sodb and sodc genes of y. enterocolitica were cloned in pet28a (+) vector. recombinant soda (82 kda) and sodb (21 kda) were expressed as homotetramer and monomer respectively, and showed activity over a broad range of  ph (3.0-8.0) and temperature (4-70 degrees c). soda and sodb showed optimal activity at 4 degrees c under acidic ph of 6.0 and 4.0 respectively. the secondary structures of recombinant soda and sodb were studied using circular dichroism. production of yesodc was not observed even after cloning and expression in e. coli bl21(de3) cells. a soda(-) sodb(-) escherichia coli strain  which was unable to grow in medium supplemented with paraquat showed normal growth after complementation with y. enterocolitica soda or sodb. conclusions/significance: this is the first report on the distribution and characterization of superoxide dismutases from y. enterocolitica. the low ph optima of both soda and sodb encoded by y. enterocolitica seem to implicate their role in acidic environments such as the intraphagocytic vesicles.

TI  == effect of the temperature of the dipping solution on the antimicrobial effectiveness of various chemical decontaminants against pathogenic and spoilage  bacteria on poultry.
AB  == the influence of the temperature of the dipping solution on the antimicrobial effectiveness of several chemical poultry decontaminants was assessed. a total of 765 poultry legs were inoculated with gram-positive bacteria (listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, or brochothrix thermosphacta) or gram-negative bacteria (salmonella enterica serotype enteritidis, escherichia coli, yersinia enterocolitica, or pseudomonas fluorescens). samples were dipped for 15 min in solutions (wt/vol) of trisodium phosphate (12%), acidified sodium chlorite (1,200 ppm), citric acid (2%), peroxyacids (220 ppm), chlorine dioxide (50 ppm), or tap water or were left untreated (control). the temperatures of the dipping solutions were 4, 20, or 50  degrees c. microbiological analyses and ph determinations were carried out after  0, 1, 3, and 5 days of storage at 4 degrees c. in comparison with the control samples, all chemical solutions were effective for reducing microbial loads. the  temperature of treatment affected the microbial reductions caused by all chemicals (p < 0.001). the lowest average bacterial reductions caused by trisodium phosphate, acidified sodium chlorite, citric acid, and peroxyacids were observed at 4 degrees c, all sampling days and microbial groups being considered  simultaneously. the highest and the lowest effectiveness for chlorine dioxide were observed at 4 and 50 degrees c, respectively. these results may be of use to meat processors for selecting the best conditions for decontamination treatments  and may help the european regulatory authorities make their decisions for authorization of poultry decontamination treatments.

TI  == synergistic effect between colistin and bacteriocins in controlling gram-negative pathogens and their potential to reduce antibiotic toxicity in mammalian epithelial cells.
AB  == pathogens resistant to most conventional antibiotics are a harbinger of the need  to discover novel antimicrobials and anti-infective agents and develop innovative strategies to combat them. the aim of this study was to assess the in vitro activity of colistin alone or in combination with two bacteriocins, nisin a and pediocin pa-1/ach, against salmonella choleraesuis atcc 14028, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853, yersinia enterocolitica atcc 9610, and escherichia coli atcc 35150 (o157:h7). the strain most sensitive to colistin was enterohemorrhagic e. coli o157:h7, which was inhibited at a concentration of about 0.12 mug/ml. when nisin a (1.70 mug/ml) or pediocin pa-1/ach (1.56 mug/ml) was combined with colistin, the concentrations required to inhibit e. coli o157:h7 were 0.01 and 0.03 mug/ml, respectively. the in vitro antigenotoxic effect of colistin was determined by using the comet assay method to measure the level of dna damage in  freshly isolated human peripheral blood leukocytes (pbls) incubated with colistin for 1 h at 37 degrees c. changes in the tail extents of pbls of about 69.29 +/- 0.08 mum were observed at a final colistin concentration of about 550 ng/ml. besides the synergistic effect, the combination of colistin (1 mg/ml) and nisin (2 mg/ml) permitted us to re-evaluate the toxic effect of colistin on vero (monkey kidney epithelial) cells.

TI  == the landscape of host transcriptional response programs commonly perturbed by bacterial pathogens: towards host-oriented broad-spectrum drug targets.
AB  == background: the emergence of drug-resistant pathogen strains and new infectious agents pose major challenges to public health. a promising approach to combat these problems is to target the host's genes or proteins, especially to discover  targets that are effective against multiple pathogens, i.e., host-oriented broad-spectrum (hobs) drug targets. an important first step in the discovery of such drug targets is the identification of host responses that are commonly perturbed by multiple pathogens. results: in this paper, we present a methodology to identify common host responses elicited by multiple pathogens. first, we identified host responses perturbed by each pathogen using a gene set enrichment  analysis of publicly available genome-wide transcriptional datasets. then, we used biclustering to identify groups of host pathways and biological processes that were perturbed only by a subset of the analyzed pathogens. finally, we tested the enrichment of each bicluster in human genes that are known drug targets, on the basis of which we elicited putative hobs targets for specific groups of bacterial pathogens. we identified 84 up-regulated and three down-regulated statistically significant biclusters. each bicluster contained a group of pathogens that commonly dysregulated a group of biological processes. we validated our approach by checking whether these biclusters correspond to known hallmarks of bacterial infection. indeed, these biclusters contained biological process such as inflammation, activation of dendritic cells, pro- and anti- apoptotic responses and other innate immune responses. next, we identified biclusters containing pathogens that infected the same tissue. after a literature-based analysis of the drug targets contained in these biclusters, we suggested new uses of the drugs anakinra, etanercept, and infliximab for gastrointestinal pathogens yersinia enterocolitica, helicobacter pylori kx2 strain, and enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli and the drug simvastatin for hematopoietic pathogen ehrlichia chaffeensis. conclusions: using a combination of automated analysis of host-response gene expression data and manual study of the  literature, we have been able to suggest host-oriented treatments for specific bacterial infections. the analyses and suggestions made in this study may be utilized to generate concrete hypothesis on which gene sets to probe further in the quest for hobs drug targets for bacterial infections. all our results are available at the following supplementary website: http://bioinformatics.cs.vt.edu/ murali/supplements/2013-kidane-plos-one.

TI  == evaluation of drug-resistant enterobacteriaceae in retail poultry and beef.
AB  == there has been increasing concern on the emergence of multidrug-resistant foodborne pathogens from foods of animal origin, including poultry. the current study aimed to evaluate antibiotic-resistant enterobacteriaceae from raw retail chicken/turkey parts (thigh, wings, breast, and ground) and beef meat (ground and chunks) in middle tennessee. resistance of the collected enterobacteriaceae to a  panel of antibiotics was determined by the kirby-bauer disk diffusion test. retail meats were also assayed for the presence of salmonella spp. and escherichia coli o157:h7. two hundred thirty-seven samples representing 95.2% of  the total of 249 samples tested were positive for enterobacteriaceae. the level of contamination with enterobacteriaceae in raw meats ranged from 3.26 log10 cfu/g to 4.94 log10 cfu/g with significant differences in counts among meat types (p < 0.05). contamination was significantly greater (p < 0.05) in ground beef, beef chucks, ground chicken, chicken breast, and turkey wings (4.92, 4.58, 4.94,  4.75, 4.13 log10 cfu/g, respectively) than ground turkey and chicken wings (3.26  and 3.26 log10 cfu/g, respectively). klebsiella oxytoca, serratia spp., e. coli,  and haffnia alvei were most prevalent contaminants at 27.4, 14.3, 12.1, and 11.4%, respectively. resistance of the enterobacteriaceae to antimicrobials was most frequent with erythromycin, penicillin, and ampicillin at 100, 89, and 65.8%, respectively. few (2.7%) of the enterobacteriaceae were resistant to chloramphenicol. salmonella spp., e. coli o157:h7, morganella morganii, yersinia  enterocolitica, and vibrio parahemolyticus exhibited multiple drug resistance. this investigation demonstrates that raw poultry and beef are potential reservoirs of antibiotic-resistant enterobacteriaceae.

TI  == bacterial growth in red blood cell units exposed to uncontrolled temperatures: challenging the 30-minute rule.
AB  == background and objectives: the '30-min rule' requires discarding red blood cells  (rbcs) exposed to uncontrolled temperatures for >30 min to ensure safe rbc transfusion. this study was aimed at determining whether multiple room temperature (rt) exposures promote bacterial growth. materials and methods: pooled and split rbc units were inoculated with ~1 cfu/ml of serratia marcescens, yersinia enterocolitica, escherichia coli or staphylococcus epidermidis. control  units remained in storage, while test units were exposed to rt for six 30-min or  three 60-min intervals. bacterial concentrations and endotoxin levels were determined after each exposure and at 42 days of storage. rbc core temperature and rt were monitored in mock units with escort ilog temperature loggers. a mixed model was used for statistical analyses. results: red blood cell core temperature reached 10.7 +/- 0.4 degrees c and 14.2 +/- 0.2 degrees c during 30- and 60-min exposures, respectively. staphylococcus epidermidis and e. coli did not grow in either control or exposed rbcs. yersinia enterocolitica concentration and endotoxin levels were similar in both control and test units. serratia marcescens concentration and endotoxin levels were higher in exposed units; however, differences between units exposed for 30 min or 60 min were not observed. conclusion: there is no added risk to rbc safety by increasing rt exposures to 60 min with each removal from storage for up to a total of 3 h during rbc shelf life. therefore, extending the 30-min limitation in rbcs exposed to uncontrolled  temperatures to 60 min should be considered by regulatory agencies.

TI  == recombinant production of yersinia enterocolitica pyruvate kinase isoenzymes pyka and pykf.
AB  == the glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase (pk) generates atp from adp through substrate-level phosphorylation powered by the conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate  to pyruvate. in contrast to other bacteria, enterobacteriaceae, such as pathogenic yersiniae, harbour two pyruvate kinases encoded by pyka and pykf. the  individual roles of these isoenzymes are poorly understood. in an attempt to make the yersinia enterocolitica pyruvate kinases pyka and pykf amenable to structural and functional characterisation, we produced them untagged in escherichia coli and purified them to near homogeneity through a combination of ion exchange and size exclusion chromatography, yielding more than 180 mg per litre of batch culture. the solution structure of pyka and pykf was analysed through small angle x-ray scattering which revealed the formation of pyka and pykf tetramers and confirmed the binding of the allosteric effector fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (fbp)  to pykf but not to pyka.

TI  == pathogenic bacteria in finnish bulk tank milk.
AB  == while the quality of raw cow milk in finland is known for its high hygienic standard, with the national average total bacterial count being below 10(4) cfu/ml annually, the prevalence of pathogenic bacteria in finnish raw milk is underreported. the aim of this study was to determine the occurrence of listeria  monocytogenes, thermophilic campylobacter spp., salmonella spp., stx-positive escherichia coli (stec), coagulase-positive staphylococci, yersinia spp., and bacillus cereus group in raw cow milk samples collected from bulk tanks at 183 finnish farms. additionally, the hygienic quality of the milk was studied by determining the total bacterial and e. coli counts. l. monocytogenes was detected in 5.5% of the milk samples, with concentrations varying from <1 to 30 cfu/ml. thermophilic campylobacter spp. or salmonella spp. were not detected in any of the samples. stec with shiga toxin-encoding stx2 was detected in 2.7% of the samples. yersinia enterocolitica was detected in 7.7% of the samples; however, all isolates were negative for ail, suggesting that they were non-pathogenic. coagulase-positive staphylococci were detected in 34.4% of the samples, with an average concentration of 25 cfu/ml in the positive samples. members of the b. cereus group were detected in 20.8% of the samples, with an average concentration of 1 cfu/ml in the positive samples. no relationship was detected between e. coli or the total bacterial count and the presence of pathogenic bacteria, which suggests that pathogens can be present also in farms with excellent production hygiene. although the concentration of pathogenic bacteria in fresh raw milk was  mainly relatively low, it should be borne in mind that some of the pathogenic bacteria can survive and multiply at refrigeration temperatures and may cause a disease with a very low infectious dose. thus, consumption of raw milk and related products poses a potential risk for food poisoning.

TI  == changes in microbial contamination levels of porcine carcasses and fresh pork in  slaughterhouses, processing lines, retail outlets, and local markets by commercial distribution.
AB  == the objective of this study was to evaluate the changes in microbial contamination levels of each porcine carcass and fresh pork in a general distribution process. a total of 100 commercial pigs were sampled (six sampling sites per individual, total 600 samples) at four sequential stages: slaughterhouse (after carcass grading and boning), processing line, retail outlet, and local market. no significant differences were observed in the contaminant percentages among sampling sites and sample collection years (p>0.05) with the exception of bacillus cereus. the contaminant percentage of b. cereus at 1st collection year was higher than these of 2nd collection year (28.31% vs. 12.26%, p<0.05). b. cereus and listeria monocytogenes were the most frequently detected pathogenic bacteria in the slaughterhouse and markets, respectively. on  the other hand, escherichia coli o157:h7 and yersinia enterocolitica were not detected in carcasses or pork collected from any carcass sites and pork samples.  however, the frequency of pathogenic bacteria in end-products at local markets was not highly related to the initial contamination of porcine carcasses in the slaughterhouse. thus, the improvement of microbial safety for pork end-products requires hygienic control of porcine carcasses and meat cutting during all operations in the slaughterhouse, processing line, retail outlet, and local market.

TI  == estimates of illnesses, hospitalizations and deaths caused by major bacterial enteric pathogens in young children in the united states.
AB  == background: many enteric pathogens disproportionately affect young children. however, higher incidences of laboratory-confirmed illness may be explained, at least in part, by higher rates of medical care-seeking and stool sample submission in this age group. we estimated the overall number of bacterial enteric illnesses among children <5 years old in the united states caused by campylobacter, escherichia coli o157, nontyphoidal salmonella, shigella and yersinia enterocolitica. materials and methods: we used a statistical model that  scaled counts of laboratory-confirmed illnesses from the foodborne diseases active surveillance network up to an estimated number of illnesses in the united  states, adjusting for the surveillance steps needed for an illness to be laboratory diagnosed (medical care sought, stool sample submitted, bacterial culture performed, laboratory tested for pathogen, laboratory test sensitivity).  results: we estimated that 5 bacterial enteric pathogens caused 291,162 illnesses each year among children <5 years old, resulting in 102,746 physician visits, 7830 hospitalizations and 64 deaths. nontyphoidal salmonella caused most illnesses (42%), followed by campylobacter (28%), shigella (21%), y. enterocolitica (5%) and e. coli o157 (3%). the estimated annual number of physician visits ranged from 3763 for e. coli o157 to 44,369 for nontyphoidal salmonella. nontyphoidal salmonella was estimated to cause most hospitalizations  (4670) and deaths (38). conclusions: bacterial enteric infections cause many illnesses in us children. compared with the general population, enteric illnesses among children <5 years old are more likely to be diagnosed. however, overall rates of illness remain higher in children after adjusting for underdiagnosis in  both groups.

TI  == ataa, a new member of the trimeric autotransporter adhesins from acinetobacter sp. tol 5 mediating high adhesiveness to various abiotic surfaces.
AB  == acinetobacter sp. tol 5 exhibits an autoagglutinating nature and noteworthy adhesiveness to various abiotic surfaces from hydrophobic plastics to hydrophilic glass and stainless steel. although previous studies have suggested that bacterionanofibers on tol 5 cells are involved in the adhesive phenotype of tol 5, the fiber that directly mediates tol 5 adhesion has remained unknown. here, we present a new member of trimeric autotransporter adhesins designated ataa, which  we discovered by analyzing a less adhesive mutant of tol 5, t1, obtained by transposon mutagenesis. ataa forms thinner and shorter nanofibers than fimbriae on tol 5 cells. we performed target disruption of ataa by allelic marker exchange, and the resulting deltaataa strain was complemented with ataa on the escherichia coli-acinetobacter shuttle vector, which was newly constructed. these results proved that ataa is essential for tol 5's autoagglutinating nature and high adhesiveness to surfaces of various materials. in addition, the adhesiveness to solid surfaces mediated by ataa is notably higher than that mediated by yada of yersinia enterocolitica wa-314. moreover, and importantly, these characteristics can be conferred to the non-adhesive, non-agglutinating bacterium acinetobacter sp. adp1 in trans by transformation with ataa, with expected applications to microbial immobilization.

TI  == phage shock protein c (pspc) of yersinia enterocolitica is a polytopic membrane protein with implications for regulation of the psp stress response.
AB  == phage shock proteins b (pspb) and c (pspc) are integral cytoplasmic membrane proteins involved in inducing the yersinia enterocolitica psp stress response. a  fundamental aspect of these proteins that has not been studied in depth is their  membrane topologies. various in silico analyses universally predict that pspb is  a bitopic membrane protein with the c terminus inside. however, similar analyses  yield conflicting predictions for pspc: a bitopic membrane protein with the c terminus inside, a bitopic membrane protein with the c terminus outside, or a polytopic protein with both termini inside. previous studies of escherichia coli  pspb-lacz and pspc-phoa fusion proteins supported bitopic topologies, with the pspb c terminus inside and the pspc c terminus outside. here we have used a series of independent approaches to determine the membrane topologies of pspb and pspc in y. enterocolitica. our data support the predicted arrangement of pspb, with its c terminus in the cytoplasm. in contrast, data from multiple independent approaches revealed that both termini of pspc are located in the cytoplasm. additional experiments suggested that the c terminus of pspc might be the recognition site for the ftsh protease and an interaction interface with pspa, both of which would be compatible with its newly proposed cytoplasmic location. this unexpected arrangement of pspc allows a new model for events underlying activation of the psp response, which is an excellent fit with observations from  various previous studies.

AB  == ail is a 17-kda chromosomally encoded outer membrane protein that mediates serum  resistance (complement resistance) in the pathogenic yersiniae (yersinia pestis,  y. enterocolitica, and y. pseudotuberculosis). in this article, we demonstrate that y. pseudotuberculosis ail from strains pb1, 2812/79, and ypiii/pib1 (serotypes o:1a, o:1b, and o:3, respectively) can bind the inhibitor of the classical and lectin pathways of complement, c4b-binding protein (c4bp). binding  was observed irrespective of serotype tested and independently of yada, which is  the primary c4bp receptor of y. enterocolitica. disruption of the ail gene in y.  pseudotuberculosis resulted in loss of c4bp binding. cofactor assays revealed that bound c4bp is functional, because bound c4bp in the presence of factor i cleaved c4b. in the absence of yada, ail conferred serum resistance to strains pb1 and ypiii, whereas serum resistance was observed in strain 2812/79 in the absence of both yada and ail, suggesting additional serum resistance factors. ail from strain ypiii/pib1 alone can mediate serum resistance and c4bp binding, because its expression in a serum-sensitive laboratory strain of escherichia coli conferred both of these phenotypes. using a panel of c4bp mutants, each deficient in a single complement control protein domain, we observed that complement control protein domains 6-8 are important for binding to ail. binding of c4bp was unaffected by increasing heparin or salt concentrations, suggesting primarily nonionic interactions. these results indicate that y. pseudotuberculosis ail recruits c4bp in a functional manner, facilitating resistance to attack from complement.

TI  == released products of pathogenic bacteria stimulate biofilm formation by escherichia coli k-12 strains.
AB  == it has recently been shown that pathogens with a limited capacity for sessile growth (like some escherichia coli o157 strains) can benefit from the presence of other bacteria and form mixed biofilms with companion strains. this study addresses the question whether pathogens may influence attached growth of e. coli non-pathogenic strains via secreted factors. we compared the biofilm-modulating effects of sterile stationary-phase culture media of a biofilm non-producing strain of e. coli o157:h, a laboratory biofilm-producing e. coli k-12 strain and  a biofilm-forming strain of the pathogen yersina enterocolitica o:3. sessile growth was monitored as biomass (crystal violet assay), exopolysaccharide (ella)  and morphology (scanning electron and confocal laser microscopy). with two of the e. coli k-12 strains stimulation of biofilm formation by all supernatants was achieved, but only the pathogens' secreted products induced biomass increase in some 'biofilm-deficient' k-12 strains. lectin-peroxidase labeling indicated changes in colanic acid and poly-n-acetylglucosamine amounts in extracellular matrices. the contribution of indole, protein and polysaccharide to the biofilm-modulating activities of the supernatants was compared. indole, in concentrations equal to those established in the supernatants, suppressed sessile growth in one k-12 strain. proteinase k significantly reduced the stimulatory effects of all supernatants, indicating a prominent role of protein/peptide factor(s) in biofilm promotion. the amount of released polysaccharides (rps) in the supernatants was quantitated then comparable quantities of isolated rps were  applied during biofilm growth. the three rps had notable strain-specific effects  with regard to both the strain-source of the rps and the e. coli k-12 target strain.

TI  == a rapid subtractive immunization method to prepare discriminatory monoclonal antibodies for food e. coli o157:h7 contamination.
AB  == to detect food e. coli o157:h7 contamination rapidly and accurately, it is essential to prepare high specific monoclonal antibodies (mabs) against the pathogen. cyclophosphamide (cy)-mediated subtractive immunization strategy was performed in mice to generate mabs that react with e. coli o157:h7, but not with  other affiliated bacteria. specificity of 19 mabs was evaluated by elisa and/or dot-immunogold filtration assay (digfa). immunogloubin typing, affinity and binding antigens of 5 selected mabs were also analysed. mabs 1d8, 4a7, 5a2 were found to have high reactivity with e. coli o157:h7 and no cross-reactivity with 80 other strains of bacteria including salmonella sp., shigella sp., proteus sp., yersinia enterocolitica, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacter freundii and other non-e. coli o157:h7 enteric bacteria. their ascetic titers reached 1:10(6) with e. coli o157:h7 and affinity constants ranged from 1.57 x 10(10) to 2.79 x 10(10) l/mol. the antigens recognized by them were different localized proteins. furthermore, immune-colloidal gold probe coated with mab 5a2 could specifically distinguish minced beef contaminated by e. coli o157:h7 from 84 other bacterial contaminations. the cy-mediated subtractive immunization procedure coupled with hybridoma technology is a rapid and efficient approach to prepare discriminatory mabs for detection of e. coli o157:h7 contamination in food.

TI  == emergence and stability of high-pressure resistance in different food-borne pathogens.
AB  == high hydrostatic pressure (hhp) processing is becoming a valuable nonthermal food pasteurization technique, although there is reasonable concern that bacterial hhp resistance could compromise the safety and stability of hhp-processed foods. while the degree of natural hhp resistance has already been shown to vary greatly among and within bacterial species, a still unresolved question remains as to what extent different food-borne pathogens can actually develop hhp resistance. in this study, we therefore examined and compared the intrinsic potentials for hhp resistance development among strains of escherichia coli, shigella flexneri,  salmonella enterica serovars typhimurium and enteritidis, yersinia enterocolitica, aeromonas hydrophila, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and listeria innocua using a selective enrichment approach. interestingly, of all strains examined, the acquisition of extreme hhp resistance could be detected in only some of the e. coli strains, indicating that a specific genetic predisposition might be required for resistance development. furthermore, once acquired, hhp resistance proved to be a very stable trait that was maintained for >80 generations in the absence of hhp exposure. finally, at the mechanistic level, hhp resistance was not necessarily linked to derepression of the heat shock genes and was not related to the phenomenon of persistence.

TI  == the patient presenting with acute dysentery--a systematic review.
AB  == objectives: the etiologies, clinical presentations and diagnosis of acute pathogen-specific dysentery in children and adults in industrialized and developing regions is described to help develop recommendations for therapy. methods: we conducted a systematic review of literature published between january 2000 and june 2011 to determine the frequency of occurrence of pathogen-specific  dysentery. results: shigella, salmonella, and campylobacter remain the most frequent bacterial causes of dysentery worldwide. shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli (stec) is potentially important in industrialized countries. entamoeba histolytica must be considered in the developing world, particularly in rural or periurban areas. clinicians should use epidemiological clues and knowledge of endemicity to suspect vibrio spp., aeromonas spp., plesiomonas spp., yersinia enterocolitica, clostridium difficile, cytomegalovirus or schistosoma mansoni in cases presenting with dysentery. a single fecal sample studied for etiologic agents is the customary way to make an etiologic diagnosis. conclusions: while a majority of dysenteric cases will not have an identifiable agent causing the illness, when an etiologic organism is identified, other than stec, each has a specific recommended form of therapy, which is provided in this  review.

TI  == innate immunity in the small intestine.
AB  == purpose of review: this article reviews the most recent publications on innate immunity in the small intestine. we will go over the innate immune receptors that act as sensors of microbial presence or cell injury, paneth cells as the main epithelial cell type that secrete antimicrobial peptides, and mucosal production  of immunoglobulin a (iga). in addition, we will give an update on examples of imbalance of the innate immune response resulting in clinical disease with the most relevant example being crohn's disease. recent findings: toll-like receptors (tlrs) are involved in b-cell homing to the intestine, rejection of small intestinal allografts, and recruitment of mast cells. the tlr adaptor toll/interleukin-1 receptor domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-beta is necessary to activate innate immunity after yersinia enterocolitica infection. moreover, myd88 is required to keep the intestinal microbiota under control and physically separated from the epithelium, and regiiigamma is responsible for the  bacterial segregation from the lining epithelial cells. in crohn's disease, atg16l1 t300a variant promotes a proinflammatory response; and mir-196 downregulates a protective immunity-related gtpase family m protein (irgm) polymorphism leading to impaired clearance of adherent escherichia coli in the intestine. summary: the intestine is continuously exposed to dietary and microbial antigens. the host has to maintain intestinal homeostasis to keep the commensal and pathogenic bacteria under control. some of the mechanisms to do so  are by expression of innate immune receptors, production of antimicrobial peptides, secretion of iga, or autophagy of intracellular bacteria. unfortunately, in some cases the innate immune response fails to protect the host and chronic inflammation, transplant rejection, or other disorders may occur.

TI  == [the new microbiological hazards in food].
AB  == this paper describes the new microbiological hazards in food. for protecting human health, nowadays food safety authorities face with many challenges, that years ago were largely unheard. in 2011 verocytotoxigenic escherichia coli o104:h4 has been isolated in germany. strain came from fenugreek sprouts originated from egypt. it was characterized by unique features such as presence of enteroaggregative escherichia coli genes (aata, aggr, aap, agga, aggc) and resistance to most antibiotics. in poland only three cases of disease caused by o104:h4 strain have been reported. another emergence pathogen in poland is yersinia enterocolitica 08, biotype 1b. it is the most pathogenic bioserotype recently isolated in the usa only. food-borne is commonly associated with raw or  undercooked pork. the source of yersinia spp. may be also milk and water. the presence ofbotulinum neurotoxins in food is not new, but still an important issue because of their high toxicity to human. botulinum neurotoxins are high-molecular thermolabile proteins produced by clostridium botulinum and some strains of clostridium butyricum and clostridium baratii. based on their antigenic properties, botulin neurotoxins are divided into seven types a-g, however only types a, b, e and f are toxic to humans and some animals. increasing risk associated with food results from antimicrobial resistance eg. extended spectrum  beta-lactamases (esbls) producing bacteria, particularly enterobacteriaceae. until recently strains esbl+ were isolated in hospitals, however during last years they have been isolated from healthy humans, animals and food of animal origin. increasingly common microbiological hazard in food is methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa). although prevalence of this pathogen in food is not high, the thread comes from difficulties of treating of infections caused by mrsa. the occurrence of food-borne in humans may also be associated with presence of viruses in food and water. the carrier of viruses may be equipment in food plant, production line, packaging and man. most food-borne are caused by noroviruses, rotaviruses, hepatitis a virus and hepatitis e virus.  an increased number of food-borne viral outbreaks are recorded in several countries. reasons for this include the improved diagnostic methods that have enhanced detection of some virus groups, and the increased marketing of fresh and frozen foods that has led to a worldwide availability of high risk food. viruses  may contaminate food either through contamination at source, principally through  sewage pollution of the environment, or in association with food

TI  == long-term trends in the epidemiology and resistance of childhood bacterial enteropathogens in crete.
AB  == in this study, we investigated the long-term trends in the epidemiology and susceptibility of bacterial enteropathogens among children in a well-defined area of adequate health standards. the study included all children younger than 14 years of age treated for enteritis at heraklion university general hospital on the island of crete during the 18-year period from january 1993 to december 2010. stool specimens were tested for salmonella, shigella, campylobacter, enteropathogenic escherichia coli (epec), yersinia, and aeromonas species. of the 33,032 stool samples from patients of any age, 2,912 (8.82%) were positive for bacterial enteropathogens. the 1,597 isolates from children were identified as s. enterica (42.3%), campylobacter spp. (33.6%), epec (17.4%), y. enterocolitica (5.82%), a. hydrophila (0.44%), and shigella spp. (0.38%). a decline in prevalence was observed for all bacterial enteropathogens. taken as a total, enteropathogens were susceptible to gentamicin, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, co-trimoxazole, and amoxicillin in 98.8%, 88.0%, 83.0%, 67.1%, and 59.6%, respectively. during the study period, the susceptibility rates decreased for co-trimoxazole (p<0.0001) and ciprofloxacin (p<0.001), and increased for amoxicillin (p<0.0001). our findings suggest declining long-term trends in the prevalence of bacterial enteropathogens and changes in susceptibility rates to first-line antibacterial agents. these changing trends in the long-term morbidity and susceptibility call for ongoing surveillance and tailored management.

TI  == pasteurization of milk: the heat inactivation kinetics of milk-borne dairy pathogens under commercial-type conditions of turbulent flow.
AB  == this is the first study to report kinetic data on the survival of a range of significant milk-borne pathogens under commercial-type pasteurization conditions. the most heat-resistant strain of each of the milk-borne pathogens staphylococcus aureus, yersinia enterocolitica, pathogenic escherichia coli, cronobacter sakazakii (formerly known as enterobacter sakazakii), listeria monocytogenes, and salmonella was selected to obtain the worst-case scenario in heat inactivation trials using a pilot-plant-scale pasteurizer. initially, approximately 30 of each species were screened using a submerged coil unit. then, uht milk was inoculated  with the most heat-resistant pathogens at ~10(7)/ml and heat treated in a pilot-plant-scale pasteurizer under commercial-type conditions of turbulent flow  for 15s over a temperature range from 56 to 66 degrees c and at 72 degrees c. survivors were enumerated on nonselective media chosen for the highest efficiency of plating of heat-damaged bacteria of each of the chosen strains. the mean log(10) reductions and temperatures of inactivation of the 6 pathogens during a 15-s treatment were staph. aureus >6.7 at 66.5 degrees c, y. enterocolitica >6.8  at 62.5 degrees c, pathogenic e. coli >6.8 at 65 degrees c, c. sakazakii >6.7 at  67.5 degrees c, l. monocytogenes >6.9 at 65.5 degrees c, and salmonella ser. typhimurium >6.9 at 61.5 degrees c. the kinetic data from these experiments will  be used by the new zealand ministry of agriculture and forestry to populate the quantitative risk assessment model being developed to investigate the risks to new zealand consumers from pasteurized, compared with nonpasteurized, milk and milk products.

TI  == host innate recognition of an intestinal bacterial pathogen induces trif-dependent protective immunity.
AB  == toll-like receptor 4 (tlr4), which signals through the adapter molecules myeloid  differentiation factor 88 (myd88) and toll/interleukin 1 receptor domain-containing adapter inducing ifn-beta (trif), is required for protection against gram-negative bacteria. trif is known to be important in tlr3-mediated antiviral signaling, but the role of trif signaling against gram-negative enteropathogens is currently unknown. we show that trif signaling is indispensable for establishing innate protective immunity against gram-negative yersinia enterocolitica. infection of wild-type mice rapidly induced both ifn-beta and ifn-gamma in the mesenteric lymph nodes. in contrast, trif-deficient mice were defective in these ifn responses and showed impaired phagocytosis in regional macrophages, resulting in greater bacterial dissemination and mortality. trif signaling may be universally important for protection against gram-negative  pathogens, as trif-deficient macrophages were also impaired in killing both salmonella and escherichia coli in vitro. the mechanism of trif-mediated protective immunity appears to be orchestrated by macrophage-induced ifn-beta and nk cell production of ifn-gamma. sequential induction of ifn-beta and ifn-gamma leads to amplification of macrophage bactericidal activity sufficient to eliminate the invading pathogens at the intestinal interface. our results demonstrate a previously unknown role of trif in host resistance to gram-negative enteropathogens, which may lead to effective strategies for combating enteric infections.

TI  == genotyping of selected bacterial enteropathogens in norway.
AB  == in norway the norwegian institute of public health (niph) is the primary facility for nationwide surveillance of foodborne infections, and it is vital that we can  perform rapid and high resolution identification of foodborne bacteria at the strain level. during the last decade a rapid introduction of dna-based methods has been introduced, which show promise in enhancing the speed and discriminatory capability of the typing laboratory. the laboratory responsible for genotyping enteropathogens at niph is limited in staff, thus methods demanding reduced labour, high degree of automation and increased ease of interpretation is essential. we found that this could be achieved by focusing on mlva for some of the most predominant enteropathogenic species. bacterial genotyping is performed  by several laboratories in norway, however this review will address the use of routine genotyping by mlva of common foodborne bacteria at niph. the emphasis will be on escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, shigella spp. yersinia enterocolitica and listeria monocytogenes. this review is based on an oral presentation given at the 9th international meeting on microbial epidemiological  markers in wernigerode germany on september 1st 2010.

TI  == ftsh-dependent degradation of phage shock protein c in yersinia enterocolitica and escherichia coli.
AB  == the widely conserved phage shock protein (psp) extracytoplasmic stress response has been studied extensively in escherichia coli and yersinia enterocolitica. both species have the pspf, -a, -b, and -c proteins, which have been linked to robust phenotypes, including y. enterocolitica virulence. pspb and pspc are cytoplasmic membrane proteins required for stress-dependent induction of psp gene expression and for bacterial survival during the mislocalization of outer membrane secretin proteins. previously, we reported that y. enterocolitica pspb functions to positively control the amount of pspc by an uncharacterized posttranscriptional mechanism. in this study, we have discovered that the cytoplasmic membrane protease ftsh is involved in this phenomenon. ftsh destabilizes pspc in y. enterocolitica, but coproduction of pspc with its binding partner pspb was sufficient to prevent this destabilization. in contrast, ftsh did not affect any other core component of the psp system. these data suggested that uncomplexed pspc might be particularly deleterious to the bacterial cell and that ftsh acts as an important quality control mechanism to remove it. this was supported by the observation that toxicity caused by pspc production was reduced  either by coproduction of pspb or by increased synthesis of ftsh. we also found that the phenomenon of ftsh-dependent pspc destabilization is conserved between y. enterocolitica and e. coli.

TI  == microbiological quality and safety of fresh cultivated and wild mushrooms commercialized in spain.
AB  == 402 samples of 22 species of cultivated and wild fresh mushrooms sold in retail markets and supermarkets in zaragoza (spain) were studied to quantify their microbial load (mesophilic aerobic microorganisms, pseudomonas genus, enterobacteriaceae, lactic acid bacteria, total and thermotolerant coliform bacteria, escherichia coli, yeasts and moulds) and to investigate the presence of e. coli o157:h7, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella spp., staphylococcus aureus and yersinia enterocolitica. the total microbial counts ranged from 4.4 to 9.4 log cfu/g, the genus pseudomonas being the most prevalent with counts from 3.7 to 9.3 log cfu/g and auricularia auricula-judae the species with the highest microbial load (9.4 log cfu/g). no significant differences (p > 0.05) were detected between mean counts of wild and cultivated species in all the microbial  groups studied. the microbiological safety level of the cultivated mushrooms was  excellent since no pathogens were isolated, and the microbial counts of indicator microorganisms were low, being detected in only half of the species. salmonella spp, e. coli o157:h7 and s. aureus were not isolated from any sample, y. enterocolitica was detected in only four samples of wild mushrooms whereas twenty-six (6.5%) were positive for l. monocytogenes, their occurrence being relatively high in calocybe gambosa (40%), hygrophorus limacinus (40%) and tuber  indicum (100%). these results suggest that a strategy to reduce bacterial populations, and to improve the microbiological safety of some species of fresh mushrooms, should be investigated.

AB  == in the mucosal immune system, m cells are known as specialized epithelial cells that take up luminal antigens, although the receptors on m cells and the mechanism of antigen uptake into m cells are not well-understood. here, we report the expression of the complement c5a receptor (c5ar) on the apical surface of m cells. c5ar mrna expression in co-cultured caco-2 human m-like cells was six-fold higher than in mono-cultured cells. c5ar expression was detected together with glycoprotein 2, an m-cell-specific protein, on the apical surface of m-like cells and mouse peyer's patch m cells. interestingly, after oral administration of yersinia enterocolitica which expresses outer membrane protein h (omph) that is homologous to the skp alpha1 domain of escherichia coli, a ligand of c5ar, dense  clustering and phosphorylation of c5ar were detected in m cells. finally, targeted antigen delivery to m cells using c5ar as a receptor was achieved using  the omph alpha1 of y. enterocolitica such that the induction of ligand-conjugated antigen-specific immune responses was confirmed in mice after oral immunization of the omph beta1alpha1-conjugated antigen. collectively, we identified c5ar expression on m cells and suggest that c5ar could be used as a target receptor for mucosal antigen delivery.

TI  == modulation of inv gene expression by the ompr two-component response regulator protein of yersinia enterocolitica.
AB  == to elucidate the physiological meaning of ompr-dependent expression of invasin gene (inv) inhibition in yersinia enterocolitica, the function of the envz/ompr regulatory pathway in osmoregulation of inv expression was analyzed in detail. the osmoregulation of inv expression was found to be a multifaceted process involving both ompr-dependent and -independent mechanisms. analysis of inv transcription in strains lacking ompr or envz proteins indicated that kinase envz is not the only regulator of ompr phosphorylation. using the transcriptional inv::lacz fusion in a heterologous system (escherichia coli) we tried to clarify  the role of ompr in the inv regulatory circuit composed of negative (h-ns) and positive (rova) regulators of inv gene transcription. we were able to show a significant increase in inv expression in e. coli ompr background under h-ns( ecoli )-repressed condition. moreover, h-ns-mediated inv repression was relieved  when rova of y. enterocolitica was expressed from a plasmid. furthermore, we showed that rova may activate inv expression irrespective on the presence of h-ns protein. using this strategy we showed that ompr of y. enterocolitica decrease rova-mediated inv activation.

TI  == the yersinia enterocolitica type 3 secretion system (t3ss) as toolbox for studying the cell biological effects of bacterial rho gtpase modulating t3ss effector proteins.
AB  == the bacterial effector proteins ipgb(1) and ipgb(2) of shigella and map of escherichia coli activate the rho gtpases rac1, rhoa and cdc42, respectively, whereas yope and yopt of yersinia inhibit these rho family gtpases. we established a yersinia toolbox which allows to study the cellular effects of these effectors in different combinations in the context of yersinia type 3 secretion system (ysc)-t3ss-mediated injection into hela cells. for this purpose  hybrid proteins were constructed by fusion of yope with the effector protein of interest. as expected, injected hybrid proteins induced membrane ruffles and yersinia uptake for ipgb(1) , stress fibres for ipgb(2) and microspikes for map.  by co-infection experiments we could demonstrate (i) ipgb(2) -mediated and rock-dependent inhibition of ipgb(1) -mediated rac1 effects, (ii) yopt-mediated suppression of ipgb(1) -induced yersinia invasion and (iii) failure of yope-mediated suppression of ipgb(1) -induced yersinia invasion, presumably due to preferential inhibition of rhog by yope gap function. by infecting polarized mdck cells we could demonstrate that map or ipgb(1) but not ipgb(2) affects cell  monolayer integrity. in summary, the yersinia toolbox is suitable to study cellular effects of effector proteins of diverse bacterial species separately or  in combination in the context of bacterial t3ss-mediated injection.

TI  == food-specific attribution of selected gastrointestinal illnesses: estimates from  a canadian expert elicitation survey.
AB  == the study used a structured expert elicitation survey to derive estimates of food-specific attribution for nine illnesses caused by enteric pathogens in canada. it was based on a similar survey conducted in the united states and focused on campylobacter spp., escherichia coli o157:h7, listeria monocytogenes,  nontyphoidal salmonella enterica, shigella spp., vibrio spp., yersinia enterocolitica, cryptosporidium parvum, and norwalk-like virus. a snowball approach was used to identify food safety experts within canada. survey respondents provided background information as well as self-assessments of their  expertise for each pathogen and the 12 food categories. depending on the pathogen, food source attribution estimates were based on responses from between  10 and 35 experts. for each pathogen, experts divided their estimates of total foodborne illness across 12 food categories and they provided a best estimate for each category as well as 5th and 95th percentile limits for foods considered to be vehicles. their responses were treated as triangular probability distributions, and linear aggregation was used to combine the opinions of each group of experts for each pathogen-food source group. across the 108 pathogen-food groups, a majority of experts agreed on 30 sources and 48 nonsources for illness. the number of food groups considered to be pathogen sources by a majority of experts varied by pathogen from a low of one food source for vibrio spp. (seafood) and c. parvum (produce) to a high of seven food sources for salmonella spp. beta distributions were fitted to the aggregated opinions and were reasonable representations for most of the pathogen-food group attributions. these results will be used to quantitatively assess the burden of foodborne illness in canada as well as to analyze the uncertainty in our estimates.

TI  == inactivation of pathogens on pork by steam-ultrasound treatment.
AB  == the objective of the study was to evaluate a new pathogen inactivation concept that combines application of pressurized steam simultaneously with high-power ultrasound through a series of nozzles. on skin and meat surfaces of pork jowl samples, counts of total viable bacteria were reduced by 1.1 log cfu/cm(2) after  treatment for 1 s and by 3.3 log cfu/cm(2) after treatment for 4 s. the mean reduction of 1.7 to 3.3 log cfu/cm(2) on the skin surface was significantly higher than the reduction of 1.1 to 2.5 log cfu/cm(2) on the meat surface. the inactivation of salmonella typhimurium, salmonella derby, salmonella infantis, yersinia enterocolitica, and a nonpathogenic escherichia coli was studied on inoculated samples that were treated for 0.5 to 2.0 s. with one exception, no significant differences in reduction were observed among the bacterial types. after treatment for 0.5 s, the 0.9-to 1.5-log reductions of e. coli were significantly higher than the 0.4- to 1.1-log reductions for salmonella and y. enterocolitica. overall, reductions increased by increasing treatment time; reductions were 0.4 to 1.5 log cfu/cm(2) after treatment for 0.5 s and 2.0 to 3.6 log cfu/cm(2) after treatment for 2 s. reductions on the skin (1 to 3.6 log cfu/cm(2)) were significantly higher than reductions on the meat surface (1 to 2.5 log cfu/cm(2)). the reduced effect on the meat surface may be explained by greater protection of bacteria in deep structures at the muscle surface. no significant difference in reduction was observed between samples inoculated with  10(4) cfu/cm(2) and those inoculated with 10(7) cfu/cm(2), and cold storage of samples for 24 h at 5 degrees c after steam-ultrasound treatment did not lead to  changes in recovery of bacteria.

TI  == differentiation of lactococci from 2 greek cheeses with protected designation of  origin by phenotypic criteria and rapd-pcr.
AB  == seventy-six lactococci isolates from 2 protected designation of origin (pdo) cheeses were studied for their acidification ability, proteolytic activity, and inhibitory activities as well as their intraspecies characterization by randomly  amplified polymorphic dna-polymerase chain reaction (rapd-pcr). fifty-two of them were characterized as lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis by the sds-page of whole-cell proteins. the test strains increased the amount of acid in milk from 6 to 24 h as well as the quantities of amino acids on incubation for 4 d. the majority of the isolates degraded preferentially alphas-casein. the isolates from feta differed from those of graviera kritis in respect of beta-casein degradation. this fragment was either not degraded or underwent a small degradation by lactococci from feta. a stronger intensity of acidification for the isolates from feta and a higher casein breakdown ability for those from graviera kritis were also recorded. lactococci from feta and graviera kritis inhibited, preferentially, the growth of escherichia coli o157:h7, and yersinia enterocolitica, respectively. a high heterogeneity among the isolates according to rapd-pcr was determined, as well as grouping of the isolates according to their source of isolation. selected isolates from each cheese could be used as starters to make either feta or graviera kritis.

TI  == antibacterial activity of the enniatin b, produced by fusarium tricinctum in liquid culture, and cytotoxic effects on caco-2 cells.
AB  == the enniatins (ens) are bioactive compounds of hexadepsipeptidic structure produced by several strains of fusarium sp. the en b was purified from extracts of fusarium tricinctum growth on liquid culture of potato dextrose broth (pdb), using a semipreparative liquid chromatography (lc) followed by an analytical lc.  the purity and the structure of the isolated compound were confirmed by the determination of the extinction coefficient and with electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (esi-ms) study. the pure fraction of en b was utilized to determine  the antibiotic effects on several bacterial strains that are considered normally  pathogens of the intestinal tract: escherichia coli, enterococcus faecium, salmonella enterica, shigella dysenteriae, listeria monocytogenes, yersinia enterocolitica, clostridium perfringens, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and staphylococcus aureus, and to study the cytotoxic effects on caco-2 differentiated and undifferentiated cells. the results obtained demonstrated that in several antibiograms, en b induced the inhibition of the grown microorganisms  tested and no significant differences over control were detected when caco-2 cells were exposed to en b, at any of the concentrations used.

TI  == catalytic efficiency of hap phytases is determined by a key residue in close proximity to the active site.
AB  == the maximum activity of yersinia enterocolitica phytase (yeappa) occurs at ph 5.0 and 45 degrees c, and notably, its specific activity (3.28 +/- 0.24 u mg(-1)) is  800-fold less than that of its yersinia kristeensenii homolog (ykappa; 88% amino  acid sequence identity). sequence alignment and molecular modeling show that the  arginine at position 79 (arg79) in yeappa corresponding to gly in ykappa as well  as other histidine acid phosphatase (hap) phytases is the only non-conserved residue near the catalytic site. to characterize the effects of the corresponding residue on the specific activities of hap phytases, escherichia coli ecappa, a well-characterized phytase with a known crystal structure, was selected for mutagenesis-its gly73 was replaced with arg, asp, glu, ser, thr, leu, or tyr. the results show that the specific activities of all of the corresponding ecappa mutants (17-2,400 u mg(-1)) were less than that of the wild-type phytase (3,524 u mg(-1)), and the activity levels were approximately proportional to the molecular volumes of the substituted residues' side chains. site-directed replacement of arg79 in yeappa (corresponding to gly73 of ecappa) with ser, leu, and gly largely increased the specific activity, which further verified the key role of the residue at position 79 for determining phytase activity. thus, a new determinant  that influences the catalytic efficiency of hap phytases has been identified.

TI  == detection of acyl-homoserine lactones by escherichia and salmonella.
AB  == escherichia and salmonella do not synthesize quorum-sensing signaling molecules of the n-acyl-l-homoserine lactone (ahl) type but they can detect ahls produced by other species of bacteria. ahls are present in the bovine rumen but not in the remainder of the gastrointestinal tract. enterohemorrhagic e. coli (ehec) responds to ahls extracted from the bovine rumen. salmonella fails to detect ahls in the gastrointestinal tracts of pathogen-free mice or pigs, suggesting that ahls are not present. however, salmonella does detect the ahl production of yersinia enterocolitica in mouse peyer's patches. in response to ahls, ehec represses flagellar genes and the lee pathogenicity island while it activates the acid fitness island, whereas salmonella activates the rck operon and a gene, srge, encoding a putative type iii secreted effector.

TI  == phenotypic and transcriptional analysis of the osmotic regulator ompr in yersinia pestis.
AB  == background: the osmotic regulator ompr in escherichia coli regulates differentially the expression of major porin proteins ompf and ompc. in yersinia  enterocolitica and y. pseudotuberculosis, ompr is required for both virulence and survival within macrophages. however, the phenotypic and regulatory roles of ompr in y. pestis are not yet fully understood. results: y. pestis ompr is involved in building resistance against phagocytosis and controls the adaptation to various stressful conditions met in macrophages. the ompr mutation likely did not affect  the virulence of y. pestis strain 201 that was a human-avirulent enzootic strain. the microarray-based comparative transcriptome analysis disclosed a set of 224 genes whose expressions were affected by the ompr mutation, indicating the global regulatory role of ompr in y. pestis. real-time rt-pcr or lacz fusion reporter assay further validated 16 ompr-dependent genes, for which ompr consensus-like sequences were found within their upstream dna regions. ompc, f, x, and r were up-regulated dramatically with the increase of medium osmolarity, which was mediated by ompr occupying the target promoter regions in a tandem manner. conclusion: ompr contributes to the resistance against phagocytosis or survival within macrophages, which is conserved in the pathogenic yersiniae. y. pestis ompr regulates ompc, f, x, and r directly through ompr-promoter dna association.  there is an inducible expressions of the pore-forming proteins ompf, c, and x at  high osmolarity in y. pestis, in contrast to the reciprocal regulation of them in e. coli. the main difference is that ompf expression is not repressed at high osmolarity in y. pestis, which is likely due to the absence of a promoter-distal  ompr-binding site for ompf.

TI  == n15: the linear phage-plasmid.
AB  == the lambdoid phage n15 of escherichia coli is very unusual among temperate phages in that its prophage is not integrated into chromosome but is a linear plasmid molecule with covalently closed ends. upon infection the phage dna circularises via cohesive ends, then phage-encoded enzyme, protelomerase, cuts at an inverted  repeat site and forms hairpin ends (telomeres) of the linear plasmid prophage. replication of the n15 prophage is initiated at an internally located ori site and proceeds bidirectionally resulting in formation of duplicated telomeres. then the n15 protelomerase cuts duplicated telomeres generating two linear plasmid molecules with hairpin telomeres. stable inheritance of the plasmid prophage is ensured by partitioning operon similar to the f factor sop operon. unlike f sop,  the n15 centromere consists of four inverted repeats dispersed in the genome. the multiplicity and dispersion of centromeres are required for efficient partitioning of a linear plasmid. the centromeres are located in n15 genome regions involved in phage replication and control of lysogeny, and binding of partition proteins at these sites regulates these processes. two n15-related lambdoid siphoviridae phages, phiko2 in klebsiella oxytoca and py54 in yersinia enterocolitica, also lysogenize their hosts as linear plasmids, as well as myoviridae marine phages vp882 and vp58.5 in vibrio parahaemolyticus and phihap-1 in halomonas aquamarina. the genomes of all these phages contain similar protelomerase genes, lysogeny modules and replication genes, as well as plasmid-partitioning genes, suggesting that these phages may belong to a group diverged from a common ancestor.

TI  == structure of the metal-dependent deacetylase lpxc from yersinia enterocolitica complexed with the potent inhibitor chir-090 .
AB  == the first committed step of lipid a biosynthesis is catalyzed by udp-(3-o-((r)-3-hydroxymyristoyl))-n-acetylglucosamine deacetylase, a metal-dependent deacetylase also known as lpxc. because lipid a is essential for  bacterial viability, the inhibition of lpxc is an appealing therapeutic strategy  for the treatment of gram-negative bacterial infections. here we report the 1.79  a resolution x-ray crystal structure of lpxc from yersinia enterocolitica (yelpxc) complexed with the potent hydroxamate inhibitor chir-090. this enzyme is a nearly identical orthologue of lpxc from yersinia pestis (99.7% sequence identity), the pathogen that causes bubonic plague. similar to the inhibition of  lpxc from escherichia coli, chir-090 inhibits yelpxc via a two-step slow, tight-binding mechanism with an apparent k(i) of 0.54 +/- 0.14 nm followed by conversion of the e.i to e.i* species with a rate constant of 0.11 +/- 0.01 min(-1). the structure of the lpxc complex with chir-090 shows that the inhibitor hydroxamate group chelates the active site zinc ion, and the "tail" of the inhibitor binds in the hydrophobic tunnel in the active site. this hydrophobic tunnel is framed by a betaalphabeta subdomain that exhibits significant conformational flexibility as it accommodates inhibitor binding. chir-090 displays a 27 mm zone of inhibition against y. enterocolitica in a kirby-bauer antibiotic assay, which is comparable to its reported activity against other gram-negative species including e. coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa. this study demonstrates that the inhibition of lpxc should be explored as a potential therapeutic and/or prophylatic response to infection by weaponized yersinia species.

TI  == microbiological quality of blue mussels (mytilus edulis) in nunavik, quebec: a pilot study.
AB  == this pilot study was aimed at documenting the presence of fecal indicators and enteric pathogens in blue mussels (mytilus edulis) from 6 communities in nunavik, quebec. one to four 2 kg samples of mussels were collected at low tide in each community. samples were investigated by enumeration methods for the fecal indicators enterococci, escherichia coli, f-specific coliphages, clostridium perfringens, and by molecular identification for the pathogens norovirus, salmonella spp., campylobacter jejuni, campylobacter coli, and campylobacter lari, verocytotoxin-producing e. coli (particularly serovar o157:h7), shigella spp., and yersinia enterocolitica. in 5 communities, the presence of giardia duodenalis and cryptosporidium spp. was also tested by microscopy and molecular methods and that of toxoplasma gondii was tested by molecular methods. apart from small quantities of clostridium perfringens in 2 samples, no bacterial or viral pathogens were detected in the mussels. toxoplasma gondii was also not detected.  however, g. duodenalis and cryptosporidium spp. were present in 18% and 73% of the samples investigated for these pathogens, respectively. when considering the  indicators and the viral and bacterial pathogens investigated, the mussels examined were of good microbiological quality, but considering the presence of potentially zoonotic protozoa, it should be recommended that consumers cook the molluscs well before eating them.

TI  == detection of representative enteropathogenic bacteria, vibrio spp., pathogenic escherichia coli, salmonella spp., shigella spp., and yersinia enterocolitica, using a virulence factor gene-based oligonucleotide microarray.
AB  == rapid identification of enteropathogenic bacteria in stool samples is critical for clinical diagnosis and antimicrobial therapy. in this study, we describe the  development of an approach that couples multiplex pcr with hybridization to a dna microarray, to allow the simultaneous detection of the 10 pathogens. the microarray was synthesized with 20-mer oligonucleotide probes that were designed  to be specific for virulence-factor genes of each strain. the detection limit for genomic dna from a single strain was approximately 10 fg. in the presence of heterogeneous non-target dna, the detection sensitivity of the array decreased to approximately 100 fg. we did not observe any non-specific hybridization. in addition, we successfully used this oligonucleotide-based dna microarray to identify the causative agents in clinical stool samples from patients with food-borne enteritis.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance of major foodborne pathogens from major meat products.
AB  == the bacterial contamination of raw and processed meat products with resistant pathogens was studied. the raw samples included sheep (40), goat (40), pork (120), beef (80), and chicken (19) meat, and the processed samples included turkey filets (33), salami (8), readymade mincemeat (16), stuffing (22), and roast-beef (50). the samples were collected from retail shops in northwestern greece over a period of 3 years. the isolated pathogens were evaluated for susceptibilities to 19 antimicrobial agents used in humans. out of 428 samples, 157 strains of escherichia coli, 25 of yersinia enterocolitica, 57 of staphylococcus aureus, 57 of enterococcus spp., 4 of salmonella spp., and 3 of campylobacter jejuni were isolated. among the isolates 14.6% of the e. coli, 10.5% of s. aureus, 4% of y. enterocolitica, 25% of salmonella spp., and 42.1% of enterococcus spp. were susceptible to antibiotics. e. coli from chicken exhibited high rates of resistance to ciprofloxacin (62.5%) followed by lamb/goat (10.9%),  pork (15.7%), and beef (27.9%) meat. resistance to nitrofurantoin dominated in the lamb/goat isolates (60%). resistance to tetracycline predominated in pork (68.2%) and chicken (62.5%), and resistance to aminoglycosides dominated in lamb/goat meat isolates. s. aureus resistance to clindamycin predominated in lamb/goat isolates (50%), whereas resistance to ciprofloxacin predominated in the pork strains, but no resistance to methicillin was observed. of the enterococci isolates 21.1% were resistant to vancomycin. high resistance to ampicillin (96%)  was observed in y. enterocolitica and all of the c. jejuni isolates were resistant to ampicillin, cephalothin, and cefuroxime. these results indicate that meat can be a source of resistant bacteria, which could potentially be spread to  the community through the food chain.

TI  == human pathogens and tetracycline-resistant bacteria in bioaerosols of swine confinement buildings and in nasal flora of hog producers.
AB  == swine confinement buildings in eastern canada are enclosed and equipped with modern production systems to manage waste. bioaerosols of these swine confinement buildings could be contaminated by human pathogens and antimicrobial resistant bacteria which could colonize exposed workers. we therefore wanted to analyze bioaerosols of swine confinement buildings and nasal flora of canadian hog producers to evaluate possible colonization with human pathogens and tetracycline-resistant bacteria. culturable and non-culturable human pathogens and tet genes were investigated in the bioaerosols of 18 barns. the nasal passages of 35 hog producers were sampled and total dna was extracted from the calcium-alginate swabs to detect, by pcr, campylobacter, c. perfringens, enterococcus, e. coli, y. enterocolitica, teta/tetc, tetg and ribosomal protection protein genes. airborne culturable c. perfringens, enterococcus, e. coli, and y. enterocolitica were present in the bioaerosols of 16, 17, 11 and 6 of the 18 facilities. aerosolized total (culturable/non culturable) campylobacter, c. perfringens, enterococcus, e. coli and y. enterocolitica were detected in 10, 6, 15, 18 and 2 barns, respectively. tet genes were found in isolates of culturable human pathogens. teta/tetc, tetg and ribosomal protection  protein genes were detected in the bioaerosols of all 18 studied buildings. campylobacter, c. perfringens, enterococcus, e. coli, and y. enterocolitica were  found respectively in 4, 9, 17, 14 and one nasal flora of workers. one and 10 workers were positive for teta/tetc and tetg genes, respectively. in swine confinement buildings, hog producers are exposed to aerosolized human pathogens and tetracycline-resistant bacteria that can contaminate the nasal flora.

AB  == the multiple-locus variable-number tandem-repeats analysis (mlva) method for genotyping has proven to be a fast and reliable typing tool in several bacterial  species. mlva is in our laboratory the routine typing method for salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar typhimurium, escherichia coli (two assays), listeria monocytogenes and yersinia enterocolitica. the gram-negative invasive enteropathogenic bacterium shigella is the most common cause of bacillary dysentery (shigellosis) worldwide, and is a global human health problem. it was of great interest to develop a rapid and robust mlva-assay for this important pathogen. though not common in norway, we do receive isolates mostly associated with foreign travel and thus an outbreak may be possible. the resulting mlva-assay is based on seven polymorphous vntrs found by search in the published  genomes of all shigella species. the assay is fast (one multiplexed pcr reaction), robust and show high divergence among the shigellae. a total of 235 shigella spp. were typed with 194 distinct mlva-genotypes. an outbreak cluster of shigella sonnei was additionally identified during manuscript preparation.

TI  == bacterial enteropathogens and risk factors associated with childhood diarrhea.
AB  == objective: to investigate the etiology of bacterial enteropathogens causing diarrhea among children; to elucidate the risk factors, sign and symptoms involved in developing of infection; and to identify the antimicrobial susceptibility pattern. methods: stool samples from diarrheal cases with clinical diagnosis of gastroenteritis compared to matched controls, were examined for detection of bacterial enteropathogens by conventional cultural method from february 2006 through january 2007. results: ninety three of diarrheal cases comprising enteropathogen isolates. a recognized bacterial enteric pathogen was identified in 31% of the cases and 8% of the control group. the frequency of isolated enteropathogens from faeces of diarrheal cases was recorded in the following order, enterohemorrhagic e. coli 8.3%, shigella spp. 6.7%, campylobacter jejuni 5%, salmonella spp. 4%, yersinia enterocolitica 2.7%, aeromonas spp. 4.7%, and plesiomonas spp. 1.3%. e.h.e coli, shigella and salmonella had shown a significant statistical association with diarrhea (p<0.05). compared to matched uninfected control, multivariate analysis revealed  that malnutrition status (or adjusted 8.37; p<0.001) was the only independent factor associated with infection. antibiotic susceptibility profile indicated that enteropathogens were generally susceptible to meropenem, ceftriaxone, followed by amikacin and ciprofloxacin. almost all enteropathogens were resistant to ampicillin and amoxicillin. conclusions: the results of this study emphasize the importance of bacterial enteropathogens in causing severe diarrhea in children. e.h.e. coli was the most predominant pathogen. malnutrition was identified as the main independent risk factor associated with developing of infection. ampicillin and amoxicillin should not be used as empirical treatment in acute diarrhea.

TI  == identification of burkholderia mallei and burkholderia pseudomallei adhesins for  human respiratory epithelial cells.
AB  == background: burkholderia pseudomallei and burkholderia mallei cause the diseases  melioidosis and glanders, respectively. a well-studied aspect of pathogenesis by  these closely-related bacteria is their ability to invade and multiply within eukaryotic cells. in contrast, the means by which b. pseudomallei and b. mallei adhere to cells are poorly defined. the purpose of this study was to identify adherence factors expressed by these organisms. results: comparative sequence analyses identified a gene product in the published genome of b. mallei strain atcc23344 (locus # bmaa0649) that resembles the well-characterized yersinia enterocolitica autotransporter adhesin yada. the gene encoding this b. mallei protein, designated boaa, was expressed in escherichia coli and shown to significantly increase adherence to human epithelial cell lines, specifically hep2 (laryngeal cells) and a549 (type ii pneumocytes), as well as to cultures of  normal human bronchial epithelium (nhbe). consistent with these findings, disruption of the boaa gene in b. mallei atcc23344 reduced adherence to all three cell types by ~50%. the genomes of the b. pseudomallei strains k96243 and dd503 were also found to contain boaa and inactivation of the gene in dd503 considerably decreased binding to monolayers of hep2 and a549 cells and to nhbe cultures.a second yada-like gene product highly similar to boaa (65% identity) was identified in the published genomic sequence of b. pseudomallei strain k96243 (locus # bpsl1705). the gene specifying this protein, termed boab, appears to be  b. pseudomallei-specific. quantitative attachment assays demonstrated that recombinant e. coli expressing boab displayed greater binding to a549 pneumocytes, hep2 cells and nhbe cultures. moreover, a boab mutant of b. pseudomallei dd503 showed decreased adherence to these respiratory cells. additionally, a b. pseudomallei strain lacking expression of both boaa and boab was impaired in its ability to thrive inside j774a.1 murine macrophages, suggesting a possible role for these proteins in survival within professional phagocytic cells. conclusions: the boaa and boab genes specify adhesins that mediate adherence to epithelial cells of the human respiratory tract. the boaa gene product is shared by b. pseudomallei and b. mallei whereas boab appears to be a b. pseudomallei-specific adherence factor.

TI  == mass spectrometry biotyper system identifies enteric bacterial pathogens directly from colonies grown on selective stool culture media.
AB  == we evaluated the performance and cost-effectiveness of a matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry-based biotyper system for  the routine identification of common enteric bacterial pathogens seen in middle tennessee from suspicious colonies grown on selective stool culture media. a total of 304 suspicious colonies were selected and further identified from 605 stool specimens. the suspicious colonies were analyzed by the biotyper system, and the results were compared to those from routine phenotypic methods, which identified 22 salmonella species, 39 shigella species, 3 enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli (ehec) isolates, 2 yersinia enterocolitica isolates, 2 campylobacter species, and 236 gastrointestinal normal flora isolates. the biotyper system correctly identified the salmonella species, yersinia enterocolitica, and campylobacter species but failed to distinguish the shigella  species and ehec isolates from e. coli. among the 236 normal flora isolates, 233  (98.7%) and 228 (96.6%) agreed at the genus and species levels, respectively, between the phenotypic and biotyper methods. organism identification scores were  insignificantly different between colonies directly from selective media and subsequently from pure subculture. the entire biotyper identification procedure,  from smear preparation to final result reporting, can be completed within 30 min. the biotyper system provides a rapid and simple screening tool for identifying many, but not all, suspicious colonies grown on selective media within 24 h after inoculation, which shortens test turnaround time by 2 to 3 days.

TI  == ompr controls yersinia enterocolitica motility by positive regulation of flhdc expression.
AB  == flagella and invasin play important roles during the early stages of infection by the enteric pathogen yersinia enterocolitica. our previous study demonstrated that ompr negatively regulates invasin gene expression at the transcriptional level. the present study focused on the role of ompr in the regulation of flagella expression. motility assays and microscopic observations revealed that an ompr mutant strain exhibits a non-motile phenotype due to the lack of flagella. an analysis of flhdc::laczya chromosomal fusions demonstrated a decrease in flhdc expression in ompr mutant cells, suggesting a role for ompr in  the positive control of flagellar master operon flhdc, which is in contrast to the negative role it plays in escherichia coli. moreover, high temperature or osmolarity and low ph decreased flhdc expression and ompr was not required for the response to these factors. evidence from an examination of the dna binding properties of ompr in vitro indicated that the mechanism by which ompr regulates  flhdc is direct. electrophoretic mobility shift assays confirmed that ompr binds  specifically to the flhdc promoter region and suggested the presence of more than one ompr-binding site. in addition, phosphorylation of ompr by acetyl-p appeared  to stimulate the binding abilities of ompr. together with the results of our previous studies revealing the negative role of ompr in the regulation of invasin expression, these findings support a model in which invasion and motility might be reciprocally regulated by ompr.

TI  == c-terminal amino acid residues of the trimeric autotransporter adhesin yada of yersinia enterocolitica are decisive for its recognition and assembly by bama.
AB  == the bam complex is a highly conserved multiprotein machine essential for the assembly of beta-barrel outer membrane proteins. it is composed of the essential  outer membrane protein bama and four outer membrane associated lipoproteins bamb-e. the yersinia enterocolitica adhesin a (yada) is the prototype of trimeric auotransporter adhesins (taas), consisting of a head, stalk and a beta-barrel membrane anchor. to investigate the role of bama in biogenesis of taas, we expressed yada in a bama-depleted strain of escherichia coli, which resulted in degradation of yada. yeast-two-hybrid experiments and immunofluorescence studies  revealed that bama and yada interact directly and colocalize. as bama recognizes  the c-terminus of omps, we exchanged the nine most c-terminal amino acids of yada. substitution of the amino acids in position 1, 3 or 5 from the c-terminus with glycine resulted in degp-dependent degradation of yada. despite degradation  all yada proteins assembled in the outer membrane. in summary we demonstrate that (i) bama is essential for biogenesis of the taa yada, (ii) bama interacts directly with yada, (iii) the c-terminal amino acid motif of yada is important for the bama-dependent assembly and differs slightly compared with other omps, and (iv) bama and yada colocalize.

TI  == adhesion, invasion, and agglutination mediated by two trimeric autotransporters in the human uropathogen proteus mirabilis.
AB  == fimbriae of the human uropathogen proteus mirabilis are the only characterized surface proteins that contribute to its virulence by mediating adhesion and invasion of the uroepithelia. pmi2122 (aipa) and pmi2575 (taap) are annotated in  the genome of strain hi4320 as trimeric autotransporters with "adhesin-like" and  "agglutinating adhesin-like" properties, respectively. the c-terminal 62 amino acids (aa) in aipa and 76 aa in taap are homologous to the translocator domains of yada from yersinia enterocolitica and hia from haemophilus influenzae. comparative protein modeling using the hia three-dimensional structure as a template predicted that each of these domains would contain four antiparallel beta sheets and that they formed homotrimers. recombinant aipa and taap were seen as approximately 28 kda and approximately 78 kda, respectively, in escherichia coli, and each also formed high-molecular-weight homotrimers, thus supporting this model. e. coli synthesizing aipa or taap bound to extracellular matrix proteins with a 10- to 60-fold-higher level of affinity than the control strain.  inactivation of aipa in p. mirabilis strains significantly (p < 0.01) reduced the mutants' ability to adhere to or invade hek293 cell monolayers, and the functions were restored upon complementation. a 51-aa-long invasin region in the aipa passenger domain was required for this function. e. coli expressing taap mediated autoagglutination, and a taap mutant of p. mirabilis showed significantly (p < 0.05) more reduced aggregation than hi4320. gly-247 in aipa and gly-708 in taap were indispensable for trimerization and activity. aipa and taap individually offered advantages to p. mirabilis in a murine model. this is the first report characterizing trimeric autotransporters in p. mirabilis as afimbrial surface adhesins and autoagglutinins.

AB  == the study used a structured expert elicitation survey to derive estimates of the  foodborne attributable proportion for nine illnesses caused by enteric pathogens  in canada. it was based on a similar study conducted in the united states and focused on campylobacter, escherichia coli o157:h7, listeria monocytogenes, nontyphoidal salmonella enterica, shigella spp., vibrio spp., yersinia enterocolitica, cryptosporidium parvum, and norwalk-like virus. for each pathogen, experts were asked to provide their best estimate and low and high limits for the proportion of foodborne illness relative to total cases. in addition, they provided background information with regard to food safety experience, including self-evaluated expertise for each pathogen on a 5-point scale. a snowball approach was used to identify 152 experts within canada. the experts' background details were summarized using descriptive statistics. factor  analysis was used to determine whether the variability in best estimates was related to self-assessed level of expertise or other background information. cluster analysis followed by beta function fitting was undertaken on best estimates from experts who self-evaluated their expertise 3 or higher. in parallel, monte carlo resampling was run using triangular distributions based on  each expert's best estimate and its limits. sixty-six experts encompassing various academic backgrounds, fields of expertise, and experiences relevant to food safety provided usable data. considerable variation between experts in their estimated foodborne attributable proportions was observed over all diseases, without any relationship to the expert's background. uncertainty about their estimate (measured by the low and high limits) varied between experts and between pathogens as well. both cluster analysis and monte carlo resampling clearly indicated disagreement between experts for campylobacter, e. coli o157, l. monocytogenes, salmonella, vibrio, and y. enterocolitica. in the absence of more  reliable estimates, the observed discrepancy between experts must be explored and understood before one can judge which opinion is the best.

TI  == enteropathogenic escherichia coli, samonella, shigella and yersinia: cellular aspects of host-bacteria interactions in enteric diseases.
AB  == a successful infection of the human intestine by enteropathogenic bacteria depends on the ability of bacteria to attach and colonize the intestinal epithelium and, in some cases, to invade the host cell, survive intracellularly and disseminate from cell to cell. to accomplish these processes bacteria have evolved an arsenal of molecules that are mostly secreted by dedicated type iii secretion systems, and that interact with the host, subverting normal cellular functions. here we overview the most important molecular strategies developed by  enteropathogenic escherichia coli, salmonella enterica, shigella flexneri, and yersinia enterocolitica to cause enteric infections. despite having evolved different effectors, these four microorganisms share common host cellular targets.

TI  == yersinia enterocolitica infection and tcaa-dependent killing of caenorhabditis elegans.
AB  == caenorhabditis elegans is a validated model to study bacterial pathogenicity. we  report that yersinia enterocolitica strains w22703 (biovar 2, serovar o:9) and wa314 (biovar 1b, serovar o:8) kill c. elegans when feeding on the pathogens for  at least 15 min before transfer to the feeding strain escherichia coli op50. the  killing by yersinia enterocolitica requires viable bacteria and, in contrast to that by yersinia pestis and yersinia pseudotuberculosis strains, is biofilm independent. the deletion of tcaa encoding an insecticidal toxin resulted in an op50-like life span of c. elegans, indicating an essential role of tcaa in the nematocidal activity of y. enterocolitica. tcaa alone is not sufficient for nematocidal activity because e. coli dh5alpha overexpressing tcaa did not result  in a reduced c. elegans life span. spatial-temporal analysis of c. elegans infected with green fluorescent protein-labeled y. enterocolitica strains showed  that y. enterocolitica colonizes the nematode intestine, leading to an extreme expansion of the intestinal lumen. by low-dose infection with w22703 or dh5alpha  followed by transfer to e. coli op50, proliferation of y. enterocolitica, but not e. coli, in the intestinal lumen of the nematode was observed. the titer of w22703 cells within the worm increased to over 10(6) per worm 4 days after infection while a significantly lower number of a tcaa knockout mutant was recovered. a strong expression of tcaa was observed during the first 5 days of infection. y. enterocolitica wa314 (biovar 1b, serovar o:8) mutant strains lacking the yada, inv, yope, and irp1 genes known to be important for virulence in mammals were not attenuated or only slightly attenuated in their toxicity toward the nematode, suggesting that these factors do not play a significant role in the colonization and persistence of this pathogen in nematodes. in summary, this study supports the hypothesis that c. elegans is a natural host and nutrient source of y. enterocolitica.

TI  == managing membrane stress: the phage shock protein (psp) response, from molecular  mechanisms to physiology.
AB  == the bacterial phage shock protein (psp) response functions to help cells manage the impacts of agents impairing cell membrane function. the system has relevance  to biotechnology and to medicine. originally discovered in escherichia coli, psp  proteins and homologues are found in gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, in archaea and in plants. study of the e. coli and yersinia enterocolitica psp systems provides insights into how membrane-associated sensory psp proteins might perceive membrane stress, signal to the transcription apparatus and use an atp-hydrolysing transcription activator to produce effector proteins to overcome  the stress. progress in understanding the mechanism of signal transduction by the membrane-bound psp proteins, regulation of the psp gene-specific transcription activator and the cell biology of the system is presented and discussed. many features of the action of the psp system appear to be dominated by states of self-association of the master effector, pspa, and the transcription activator, pspf, alongside a signalling pathway that displays strong conditionality in its requirement.

TI  == human complement factor h binds to outer membrane protein rck of salmonella.
AB  == serum resistance, or resistance to complement-mediated killing, is a key virulence property of microbial pathogens. rck is a 17-kda outer membrane protein encoded on the virulence plasmid of salmonella enterica serovars typhimurium and  enteritidis. when expressed in either escherichia coli or s. enterica typhimurium, rck confers serum resistance independent of lps length. recently, the rck homolog from yersinia enterocolitica, ail, has been shown to bind the complement regulatory protein factor h (fh). based on these observations, we hypothesized that rck may also possess this ability. using both flow cytometery and direct binding analysis, we demonstrate that rck expressed in e. coli binds fh. we observed fh binding to rck from human serum and also using the purified protein. expression of rck protected bacteria from alternative pathway-mediated killing and was associated with a reduction in c3b, bb, and membrane attack complex deposition. fh bound to rck promoted c3b cleavage in the presence of factor i. binding was specific and mediated by two regions in fh, the short consensus repeats 5-7 and 19 to 20. these results suggest that fh recruitment by  rck is functional and can protect a normally serum-sensitive heterologous host against complement attack. binding and exploitation of fh may thus contribute to  rck-mediated serum resistance.

TI  == enteric bacterial pathogens with zoonotic potential isolated from farm-raised deer.
AB  == the raising of captive white-tailed deer (odocoileus virginianus) is a growing agricultural industry in ohio as it is in several other areas of the united states and around the world. pooled fecal samples were collected from 30 white-tailed deer confinement facilities. samples were cultured for five enteric  bacterial pathogens. premise prevalence rates were as follows: escherichia coli o157, 3.3%; listeria monocytogenes, 3.3%; salmonella enterica, 0%; yersinia enterocolitica, 30%; and clostridium difficile, 36.7%. the ail virulence gene could not be amplified from any of the y. enterocolitica isolates recovered. toxigenic strains of c. difficile polymerase chain reaction ribotype 078, an emerging c. difficile genotype of humans and food animals, were recovered from 4  of 11 (36.4%) c. difficile-positive deer farms. venison from farm-raised deer might become contaminated with foodborne pathogens, deer farmers may have occupational exposure to these zoonotic agents, and farm-raised deer could be a reservoir from which the environment and other livestock may become contaminated  with a number of potentially zoonotic bacteria.

TI  == isolation of bacteriocin-like substances producing bacteria from finished cattle-manure compost and activity evaluation against some food-borne pathogenic  and spoilage bacteria.
AB  == a finished compost sample was examined for bacteriocin-like substance production  against five pathogenic bacteria: salmonella typhimurium ef 85-9, escherichia coli o157:h7 atcc 43888, enterococcus faecalis jcm 8726, staphylococcus aureus jcm 2151, and yersinia enterocolitica jcm 7577. at the preliminary detection of bacterial strains exhibiting antimicrobial activity from the compost sample, thirteen strains could be isolated. screening of the inhibitory activity was done using agar-well diffusion assay and microtiter plate growth assay. six bacterial  strains from the compost showed an antimicrobial activity against one or more of  the tested indicator strains. four strains (m1-m4) belonged to shigella species and the other two strains (m5 and m6) belonged to salmonella species. the antimicrobial activity was sensitive for alpha-chymotrypsin and papain. the antimicrobial substances from m3, m4 and m6 were heat stable when heated for 15 min at 121 degrees c with 100% relative activity. the bacteriocin-like substance  produced by strain m2 was partially characterized. it exhibited an inhibitory activity against the tested food-borne pathogenic and spoilage bacteria, except enterobacter aerogenes jcm 1235 and lactobacillus plantarum subsp. plantarum jcm  1149. it was stable at a wide range of ph (3-11). there was no loss of activity for up to 3 weeks when stored at 4 and -20 degrees c or for up to 2 weeks when stored at 28 and -80 degrees c. this is the first report indicating the presence  of bacteriocin-like activity in animal manure compost.

TI  == transcriptional activation of the tad type ivb pilus operon by pypb in yersinia enterocolitica.
AB  == type iv pili are virulence factors in various bacteria and mediate, among other functions, the colonization of diverse surfaces. various subclasses of type iv pili have been identified, but information on pilus expression, biogenesis, and the associated phenotypes is sparse for the genus yersinia. we recently described the identification of pypb as a transcriptional regulator in yersinia enterocolitica. here we show that the pypb gene is associated with the tad locus, a genomic island that is widespread among bacterial and archaeal species. the genetic linkage of pypb with the tad locus is conserved throughout the yersiniae  but is not found among other bacteria carrying the tad locus. we show that the genes of the tad locus form an operon in y. enterocolitica that is controlled by  pypb and that pypb is part of this operon. the tad genes encode functions necessary for the biogenesis of the flp subfamily of type ivb pili initially described for aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans to mediate a tight-adherence  phenotype. in y. enterocolitica, the flp pilin protein shows some peculiarities in its amino acid sequence that imply similarities as well as differences compared to typical motifs found in the flp subtype of type ivb pili. flp is expressed and processed after pypb overproduction, resulting in microcolony formation but not in increased adherence to biotic or abiotic surfaces. our data  describe the transcriptional regulation of the tad type ivb pilus operon by pypb  in y. enterocolitica but fail to show most previously described phenotypes associated with this type of pilus in other bacteria.

TI  == entry exclusion and orit of a conjugative system encoded by the cryptic plasmid p29930 of yersinia enterocolitica.
AB  == the conjugative transfer system of yersinia enterocolitica 29930 present on the cryptic plasmid p29930 comprises a mating pore formation system (mpf) related to  that of the incx plasmid r6k and a dna transfer and replication system (dtr) with close relationship to the mob region of the mobilizable plasmid clodf13. two regions of the transfer system were selected for more detailed analyses of basic  functions of conjugative transfer. the putative open reading frame orf22 located  in the mpf region confers the entry exclusion phenotype to possible recipient cells and inhibited conjugative transfer, when it was inserted into the coding region of the cat gene of pacyc184 in sense direction. mobilization experiments with recombinant plasmids revealed that a 611bp fragment of the dtr region containing two repeat sequences were required for a functional orit by the conjugation system of y. enterocolitica. while the conjugative transfer of cryptic plasmids harbouring the complete conjugation system had not been demonstrated previously, plasmid pbk17 containing the functional orit was successfully mobilized from y. enterocolitica strains into escherichia coli, thus proving that the transfer system could contribute to the spread of these plasmids in nature.

AB  == yersinia pestis is a virulent human pathogen and potential biological weapon. despite a long history of research on this organism, there is no licensed vaccine to protect against pneumonic forms of y. pestis disease. in the present study, plasmids were constructed to express cholera toxin a(2)/b chimeric molecules containing the lcrv protective antigen from yersinia enterocolitica and y. pestis. these chimeras were expressed and purified to high yields from the supernatant of transformed escherichia coli. western and gm(1) elisa assays were  used to characterize the composition, receptor-binding and relative stability of  the lcrv-cta(2)/b chimera in comparison to cholera toxin. in addition, we investigated the ability of the y. pestis lcrv-cta(2)/b chimera to bind to and internalize into cultured epithelial cells and macrophages by confocal microscopy. these studies indicate that the uptake and trafficking of the lcrv antigen from the chimera is comparable to the trafficking of native toxin. together these findings report that stable, receptor-binding, non-toxic lcrv-cholera toxin a(2)/b chimeras can be expressed at high levels in e. coli and purified from the supernatant. in addition, the internalization of antigen in vitro reported here supports the development of these molecules as novel mucosal  vaccine candidates.

TI  == effect of dissolved oxygen on two bacterial pathogens examined using atr-ftir spectroscopy, microelectrophoresis, and potentiometric titration.
AB  == the effects of dissolved oxygen tension during bacterial growth and acclimation on the cell surface properties and biochemical composition of the bacterial pathogens escherichia coli o157:h7 and yersinia enterocolitica are characterized. three experimental techniques are used in an effort to understand the influence of bacterial growth and acclimation conditions on cell surface charge and the composition of the bacterial cell: (i) electrophoretic mobility measurements; (ii) potentiometric titration; and (iii) atr-ftir spectroscopy. potentiometric titration data analyzed using chemical speciation software are related to measured electrophoretic mobilities at the ph of interest. titration of bacterial cells is used to identify the major proton-active functional groups and the overall concentration of these cell surface ligands at the cell membrane. analysis of titration data shows notable differences between strains and conditions, confirming the appropriateness of this tool for an overall charge characterization. atr-ftir spectroscopy of whole cells is used to further characterize the bacterial biochemical composition and macromolecular structures  that might be involved in the development of the net surficial charge of the organisms examined. the evaluation of the integrated intensities of hpo(2)(-) and carbohydrate absorption bands in the ir spectra reveals clear differences between growth protocols. taken together, the three techniques seem to indicate that the  dissolved oxygen tension during cell growth or acclimation can noticeably influence the expression of cell surface molecules and the measurable cell surface charge, though in a strain-dependent fashion.

TI  == high bacterial contamination of pig tonsils at slaughter.
AB  == food-borne zoonoses have a major health impact in industrial countries. campylobacter spp., salmonella enterica, yersinia enterocolitica and listeria monocytogenes are high-risk food-borne zoonotic hazards in finishing pigs. the objectives of this work were (1) to study the isolation rate of pathogenic y. enterocolitica, salmonella spp., campylobacter spp. and l. monocytogenes in the tonsils and feces and (2) to determine the number of mesophilic aerobic bacteria  (mab) and escherichia coli in the tonsils of fattening pigs at slaughter. the samples, which were collected from one slaughterhouse on five occasions, originated from 50 pigs and 15 farms. the number of mab varied from 6.40 to 7.82  log(10) cfu/g and e. coli from 4.38 to 6.53 log(10) cfu/g. additionally, 31 (62%) of the tonsils were colonized with y. enterocolitica and 16 (32%) with l. monocytogenes. campylobacter spp. were more frequently excreted in feces and only 3 (6%) of the pigs carried campylobacter spp. in the tonsils. no salmonella spp.  were isolated. the pig tonsils were shown to be colonized with a high number of bacteria including e. coli, which is the most important indicator for fecal contamination, and with y. enterocolitica and l. monocytogenes, which are important food-borne pathogens. this study demonstrates that the tonsils are highly contaminated with micro-organisms and can be a very important source of contamination in the slaughterhouse.

TI  == amino-terminal residues dictate the export efficiency of the campylobacter jejuni filament proteins via the flagellum.
AB  == bacterial flagella play an essential role in the pathogenesis of numerous enteric pathogens. the flagellum is required for motility, colonization, and in some instances, for the secretion of effector proteins. in contrast to the intensively studied flagella of escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium, the flagella of  campylobacter jejuni, helicobacter pylori and vibrio cholerae are less well characterized and composed of multiple flagellin subunits. this study was performed to gain a better understanding of flagellin export from the flagellar type iii secretion apparatus of c. jejuni. the flagellar filament of c. jejuni is comprised of two flagellins termed flaa and flab. we demonstrate that the amino-termini of flaa and flab determine the length of the flagellum and motility of c. jejuni. we also demonstrate that protein-specific residues in the amino-terminus of flaa and flab dictate export efficiency from the flagellar type iii secretion system (t3ss) of yersinia enterocolitica. these findings demonstrate that key residues within the amino-termini of two nearly identical proteins influence protein export efficiency, and that the mechanism governing the efficiency of protein export is conserved among two pathogens belonging to distinct bacterial classes. these findings are of additional interest because c.  jejuni utilizes the flagellum to export virulence proteins.

AB  == background: an individual's intestinal bacterial flora is established soon after  birth. delivery by cesarean section (c-section) deprives the newborn of colonization with maternal vaginal bacteria. we determined whether delivery by c-section is associated with an altered risk of infection with intestinal bacterial pathogens. methods: in a cohort of 1.7 million danes born 1973-2005 we  identified cases of laboratory-confirmed non-typhoidal salmonella species, campylobacter species, yersinia enterocolitica, shigella species, and shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli from 1991-2005 in the national registry of enteric pathogens. using poisson-regression we estimated confounder-adjusted incidence rate ratios (irrs) for infection according to mode of delivery. results: during 14.0 million person-years of follow-up, 22,486 individuals were diagnosed with 1 intestinal bacterial infection. c-section was associated with a  small increase in risk at age 1 to <2 years (irr, 1.09; 95% confidence interval,  1.00-1.18) and at age 2 to <5 years (irr, 1.08; 95% confidence interval, 1.00-1.17), but after age 5 years, there was no significant association. assuming causality only 0.62% of intestinal bacterial infections were attributable to c-section. conclusions: mode of delivery appears not to be a clinically relevant  determinant of risk for intestinal bacterial infections. the possible impact of increasing frequencies of c-section on the overall burden of intestinal bacterial infections appears negligible.

AB  == type ii secretion systems (t2sss) mediate the transport of proteins through the bacterial outer membrane. although widespread in gamma-proteobacteria, they have  so far not been characterized in the human pathogen yersinia enterocolitica. we describe here genetic linkage of the yts1 and yts2 t2sss with a transcriptional regulator in the highly pathogenic y. enterocolitica biotype 1b. while the yts2-associated pypc regulator activates the yts2 operon, the pclr regulator does not induce transcription of its cognate yts1 operon. instead, yts1 and pclr are activated by the addition of mgcl(2) to the growth medium at 17 degrees c and 26  degrees c, but not at 37 degrees c. we identified three proteins, chiy, engy (ye2830) and ye3650, that are secreted depending on a functional yts1 t2ss in response to mgcl(2) at low temperature. while the activation of chiy by mgcl(2) depends on pclr, pclr overproduction is not sufficient for chiy transcription in  an escherichia coli background, demonstrating the need for additional y. enterocolitica-specific factors. as chiy and engy both bind to chitin, and ye3650 shows motifs conserved in oligosaccharide-binding enzymes, all secreted proteins  might be important for polysaccharide interaction/degradation during infection or in the environment.

TI  == wild boars as an important reservoir for foodborne pathogens.
AB  == one hundred fifty-three wild boars shot in the canton of geneva, switzerland, were studied for the occurrence of foodborne pathogens. tonsils and fecal samples of the animals were examined using real-time polymerase chain reaction, enzyme-linked fluorescent immunoassay, and cultural methods. the detection rate of salmonella spp., yersinia enterocolitica, yersinia pseudotuberculosis, stx-positive escherichia coli, and listeria monocytogenes was 12%, 35%, 20%, 9%,  and 17%, respectively, when tonsil samples were studied. only y. enterocolitica (5%) and l. monocytogenes (1%) were detected in fecal samples. none of the samples was positive for campylobacter spp. females (71%) and young animals (61%) carried more frequently one or more pathogens than males (53%) and older ones (44%). in total, 8 salmonella spp., 14 y. enterocolitica, 4 y. pseudotuberculosis, and 26 l. monocytogenes strains were further characterized. most of the salmonella spp. strains were of serotype salmonella enteritidis (75%) followed by serotypes salmonella stourbridge (13%) and salmonella veneziana (13%). l. monocytogenes strains belonged to serotypes 1/2a (42%), 1/2b (19%), and 4b (38%). serotypes o:3 (36%), o:5,27 (21%), and o:9 (29%) were identified among  y. enterocolitica strains and serotypes o:1 (75%) and o:2 (25%) among y. pseudotuberculosis strains. this study shows that wild boars are frequent carriers of foodborne pathogens. high wild boar densities and increasing popularity of outdoor ranging of pigs may intensify the risk of transmission of these pathogens to fattening pigs.

TI  == adding to yersinia enterocolitica gene pool diversity: two cryptic plasmids from  a biotype 1a isolate.
AB  == we report the nucleotide sequence of two novel cryptic plasmids (4357 and 14 662  base pairs) carried by a yersinia enterocolitica biotype 1a strain isolated from  pork. as distinguished from most biotype 1a strains, this isolate, designated 07-04449, exhibited adherence to eukaryotic cells. the smaller plasmid pye4449-1  carries five attributable open reading frames (orfs) encoding the first ccda/ccdb-like antitoxin/toxin system described for a yersinia plasmid, a repa-like replication initiation protein, and mobilizing factors moba and mobc. the deduced amino acid sequences showed highest similarity to proteins described  in salmonella (ccda/b), klebsiella (repa), and plesiomonas (moba/c) indicating genomic fluidity among members of the enterobacteriaceae. one additional orf with unknown function, termed orf5, was identified with an ancestry distinct from the  rest of the plasmid. while the c+g content of orf5 is 38.3%, the rest of pye4449-1 shows a c+g content of 55.7%. the c+g content of the larger plasmid pye4449-2 (54.9%) was similar to that of pye4449-1 (53.7%) and differed from that of the y. enterocolitica genome (47.3%). of the 14 orfs identified on pye4449-2,  only six orfs showed significant similarity to database entries. for three of these orfs likely functions could be ascribed: a tnpr-like resolvase and a phage  replication protein, localized each on a low c+g island, and dna primase trac. two orfs of pye4449-2, orf3 and orf7, seem to encode secretable proteins. epitope-tagging of orf3 revealed protein expression at 4 degrees c but not at or  above 27 degrees c suggesting adaptation to a habitat outside swine. the hypothetical protein encoded by orf7 is the member of a novel repeat protein family sharing the dxxgn(x)(n)dxxgn motif. our findings illustrate the exceptional gene pool diversity within the species y. enterocolitica driven by horizontal gene transfer events.

TI  == diagnostic bioluminescent phage for detection of yersinia pestis.
AB  == yersinia pestis is the etiological agent of the plague. because of the disease's  inherent communicability, rapid clinical course, and high mortality, it is critical that an outbreak, whether it is natural or deliberate, be detected and diagnosed quickly. the objective of this research was to generate a recombinant luxab ("light")-tagged reporter phage that can detect y. pestis by rapidly and specifically conferring a bioluminescent signal response to these cells. the bacterial luxab reporter genes were integrated into a noncoding region of the cdc plague-diagnostic phage phia1122 by homologous recombination. the identity and fitness of the recombinant phage were assessed through pcr analysis and lysis assays and functionally verified by the ability to transduce a bioluminescent signal to recipient cells. the reporter phage conferred a bioluminescent phenotype to y. pestis within 12 min of infection at 28 degrees c. the signal response time and signal strength were dependent on the number of cells present.  a positive signal was obtained from 10(2) cells within 60 min. a signal response  was not detectable with escherichia coli, although a weak signal (100-fold lower  than that with y. pestis) was obtained with 1 (of 10) yersinia enterocolitica strains and 2 (of 10) yersinia pseudotuberculosis strains at the restrictive temperature. importantly, serum did not prevent the ability of the reporter phage to infect y. pestis, nor did it significantly quench the resulting bioluminescent signal. collectively, the results indicate that the reporter phage displays promise for the rapid and specific diagnostic detection of cultivated y. pestis isolates or infected clinical specimens.

TI  == salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium can detect acyl homoserine lactone production by yersinia enterocolitica in mice.
AB  == luxr-type transcription factors detect acyl homoserine lactones (ahls) and are typically used by bacteria to determine the population density of their own species. escherichia coli and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium cannot synthesize ahls but can detect the ahls produced by other bacterial species using the luxr homolog, sdia. previously we determined that s. typhimurium did not detect ahls during transit through the gastrointestinal tract of a guinea pig, a  rabbit, a cow, 5 mice, 6 pigs, or 12 chickens. however, sdia was activated during transit through turtles colonized by aeromonas hydrophila, leading to the hypothesis that sdia is used for detecting the ahl production of other pathogens. in this report, we determined that sdia is activated during the transit of s. typhimurium through mice infected with the ahl-producing pathogen yersinia enterocolitica. sdia is not activated during transit through mice infected with a yeni mutant of y. enterocolitica that cannot synthesize ahls. however, activation of sdia did not confer a fitness advantage in yersinia-infected mice. we hypothesized that this is due to infrequent or short interactions between s. typhimurium and y. enterocolitica or that the sdia regulon members do not function in mice. to test these hypotheses, we constructed an s. typhimurium strain that synthesizes ahls to mimic a constant interaction with y. enterocolitica. in this background, sdia(+) s. typhimurium rapidly outcompetes the sdia mutant in mice. all known members of the sdia regulon are required for this phenotype. thus, all members of the sdia regulon are functional in mice.

TI  == dna adenine methylase is involved in the pathogenesis of edwardsiella tarda.
AB  == edwardsiella tarda is a serious aquaculture pathogen that can infect many cultured fish species. the aim of this study was to investigate the potential importance of dna adenine methylase (dam) in e. tarda pathogenesis. the e. tarda  dam gene (dam(et)) was cloned from a pathogenic strain, txd1, isolated from diseased fish. dam(et) shares high (70.2%) sequence identity with the dam proteins of yersinia enterocolitica and several other bacterial species. recombinant dam(et) is able to complement a dam-deficient escherichia coli strain and methylate the genomic dna. attenuation of dam(et) expression by antisense rna interference had no apparent effect on the growth of txd1, but caused significant attenuation of overall bacterial virulence and altered several stress responses including spontaneous mutation, recovering from uv radiation and h(2)o(2) exposure, binding to host mucus, and dissemination in host blood and liver. in addition, attenuation of dam(et) expression increased luxs expression and ai-2 activities in e. tarda. these results indicate that dam(et) is a virulence determinant and plays a role in the pathogenesis of txd1, and that temporal expression of dam(et) is essential for optimal bacterial infection.

TI  == study on the antibiotic activity of microcapsule curcumin against foodborne pathogens.
AB  == curcumin as an edible natural pigment has several biological activities but its use as a food colorant and preservative is restricted due to low stability and insolubility in water. stabilizing it with microencapsulation to obtain microcapsule curcumin can improve its stability and solubility. the microcapsule  curcumin was studied for their antibacterial and antifungal activities against some foodborne pathogens and spoilage microbe such as escherichia coli, yersinia  enterocolitica, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, bacillus cereus, aspergillus niger, penicllium notatum, and saccharomyces cerevisiae. it exhibited broad spectrum inhibitory effect against all organisms by oxford cup methods, and its minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) were determined by agar dilution method and ranged from 15.7 to 250 microg/ml. for the selected microorganisms, its antibacterial activity was more pronounced against gram-positive bacteria than gram-negative bacteria. furthermore, its antifungal activity is much better  than antibacterial activity. microcapsule curcumin remains in antibacterial and antifungal activities after microencapsulation, which can be potential colorant and preservative in food industry.

TI  == analysis of the yersinia enterocolitica pspbc proteins defines functional domains, essential amino acids and new roles within the phage-shock-protein response.
AB  == the yersinia enterocolitica phage-shock-protein (psp) stress response system is activated by mislocalized outer-membrane secretin components of protein export systems and is essential for virulence. the cytoplasmic membrane proteins pspb and pspc were proposed to be dual function components of the system, acting both  as positive regulators of psp gene expression and to support survival during secretin-induced stress. in this study we have uncoupled the regulatory and physiological functions of pspbc and discovered unexpected new roles, functional  domains and essential amino acids. first, we showed that pspb controls pspc concentration by both pre- and post-transcriptional mechanisms. we then screened  for pspbc mutants with altered transcriptional regulatory function. unexpectedly, we identified pspb and pspc mutants that activated psp gene expression in the absence of secretin-induced stress. together with a subsequent truncation analysis, this revealed that the pspc cytoplasmic domain plays an unforeseen role in negatively regulating psp gene expression. conversely, mutations within the pspc periplasmic domain abolished its ability to activate psp gene expression. significantly, pspc mutants unable to activate psp gene expression retained their ability to support survival during secretin-induced stress. these data provide compelling support for the proposal that these two functions are independent.

AB  == background: the objective of this study was to determine whether neonatal nasogastric enteral feeding tubes are colonised by the opportunistic pathogen cronobacter spp. (enterobacter sakazakii) and other enterobacteriaceae, and whether their presence was influenced by the feeding regime. methods: one hundred and twenty-nine tubes were collected from two neonatal intensive care units (nicu). a questionnaire on feeding regime was completed with each sample. enterobacteriaceae present in the tubes were identified using conventional and molecular methods, and their antibiograms determined. results: the neonates were  fed breast milk (16%), fortified breast milk (28%), ready to feed formula (20%),  reconstituted powdered infant formula (pif, 6%), or a mixture of these (21%). eight percent of tubes were received from neonates who were 'nil by mouth'. organisms were isolated from 76% of enteral feeding tubes as a biofilm (up to 107 cfu/tube from neonates fed fortified breast milk and reconstituted pif) and in the residual lumen liquid (up to 107 enterobacteriaceae cfu/ml, average volume 250 mul). the most common isolates were enterobacter cancerogenus (41%), serratia marcescens (36%), e. hormaechei (33%), escherichia coli (29%), klebsiella pneumoniae (25%), raoultella terrigena (10%), and s. liquefaciens (12%). other organisms isolated included c. sakazakii (2%),yersinia enterocolitica (1%),citrobacter freundii (1%), e. vulneris (1%), pseudomonas fluorescens (1%), and p. luteola (1%). the enteral feeding tubes were in place between < 6 h (22%)  to > 48 h (13%). all the s. marcescens isolates from the enteral feeding tubes were resistant to amoxicillin and co-amoxiclav. of additional importance was that a quarter of e. hormaechei isolates were resistant to the 3rd generation cephalosporins ceftazidime and cefotaxime. during the period of the study, k. pneumoniae and s. marcescens caused infections in the two nicus. conclusion: this study shows that neonatal enteral feeding tubes, irrespective of feeding regime,  act as loci for the bacterial attachment and multiplication of numerous opportunistic pathogens within the enterobacteriaceae family. subsequently, these organisms will enter the stomach as a bolus with each feed. therefore, enteral feeding tubes are an important risk factor to consider with respect to neonatal infections.

TI  == evidence-based semiquantitative methodology for prioritization of foodborne zoonoses.
AB  == objectives: to prioritize an extended list of food- and water-borne zoonoses to allow food safety authorities to focus on the most relevant hazards in the food chain. methods: an evidence-based semiquantitative methodology was developed. scores were given by 35 scientific experts in the field of animal and public health, food, and clinical microbiology and epidemiology to 51 zoonotic agents according to five criteria related to public health (severity and occurrence in humans), animal health (severity of disease coupled with economic consequences and occurrence in animals), and food (occurrence in food). the scoring procedure  was standardized and evidence-based as experts were provided, for each zoonotic agent, a same set of up-to-date help information data related to the five criteria. independently, the relative importance of the five criteria was weighted by seven food chain risk managers. the zoonotic agents were ranked based on overall weighted scores and were grouped in four statistically different levels of importance. results: the following foodborne zoonotic pathogens were classified as "most important": salmonella spp., campylobacter spp., listeria monocytogenes, and verocytotoxigenic escherichia coli. a second group of "significant importance" included toxoplasma gondii, the agent of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, clostridium botulinum, staphylococcus aureus, cryptosporidium parvum, mycobacterium bovis, echinococcus granulosus, streptococcus spp., echinococcus multilocularis, yersinia enterocolitica, mycobacterium avium, fasciola hepatica, giardia intestinalis, and rotavirus. conclusions: this methodology allowed to rank 51 zoonotic agents with objectivity and taking account of a combined input from risk assessors and risk managers. applications: these results support food safety policy makers to establish the multiannual monitoring program of foodborne zoonoses. they also enable to identify knowledge gaps on specific zoonotic agents and to formulate key research questions. principally, this method of prioritization is of general interest as it can be applied for any other ranking exercise and in any country.

TI  == extracellular secretion of carocin s1 in pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum occurs via the type iii secretion system integral to the bacterial flagellum.
AB  == background: pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum is a phytopathogenic enterobacterium responsible for soft rot, a disease characterized by extensive maceration of the affected plant tissue. this species also produces two or more antibacterial substances called bacteriocins, which enhance its competitiveness against related rival species. however, the secretion mechanism for low-molecular-weight bacteriocin is still unknown. results: a mutant (flhc::tn5)  that did not secrete the low-molecular-weight bacteriocin (lmwb), carocin s1, was generated by tn5 insertional mutagenesis. sequence analysis indicated that this insertion disrupted open reading frame 2 (orf2) and orf3 of this strain. deletion and rescue experiments indicated that orf2 and orf3 were both required for extracellular lmwb secretion. the orf2 and orf3 sequences showed high homology with the flhd and flhc gene sequences of pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. atroseptica, serratia marcescens, yersinia enterocolitica, and escherichia coli,  indicating that they likely encoded key regulatory components of the type iii flagella secretion system. conclusion: thus, the extracellular export of carocin  s1 by pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum appears to utilize the type iii secretion system integral to bacterial flagella.

TI  == effect of mixed antimicrobial agents and flavors in active packaging films.
AB  == active packaging is an emerging food technology to improve the quality and safety of food products. many works have been developed to study the antimicrobial activity of essential oils. essential oils have been traditionally used as flavorings in food, so they have an important odor impact but they have as well antimicrobial properties that could be used to protect the food. recent developments in antimicrobial active packaging showed the efficiency of essential oils versus bread and bakery products among other applications. however, one of the main problems to face is the odor and taste they could provide to the packaged food. using some aromas to mask the odor could be a good approach. that  is why the main objective of this paper is to develop an antimicrobial packaging  material based on the combination of the most active compounds of essential oils  (hydrocinnamaldehyde, oregano essential oil, cinnamaldehyde, thymol, and carvacrol) together with some aromas commonly used in the food industry. a study  of the concentration required to get the antimicrobial properties, the organoleptic compatibility with typical aroma present in many food systems (vanilla, banana, and strawberry), and the right combination of both systems has  been carried out. antimicrobial tests of both the mentioned aromas, the main components of some essential oils, and the combination of both groups were carried out against bacteria (enterococcus faecalis, listeria monocytogenes, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella choleraesuis, yersinia enterocolitica, escherichia coli), yeasts (candida albicans, debaryomyces hansenii, zygosaccharomyces rouxii), and molds (botrytis cinerae, aspergillus flavus, penicillium roqueforti, eurotium repens, penicillium islandicum, penicillium commune, penicillium nalgiovensis). the sensory properties of the combinations were evaluated with a triangular test and classification was by an order test; the odor threshold of the aroma compounds was also studied. the results reveal that none of the aromas had antimicrobial properties. the most antimicrobial compounds are thymol, carvacrol, and cinnamaldehyde, but none of them could be combined with banana aroma, whereas only thymol with strawberry aroma gave the right combined organoleptic profile. all of the antimicrobials under study could be combined with vanilla aroma, providing both antimicrobial property and the odor expected.

AB  == enterohaemorrhagic and enteropathogenic escherichia coli (ehec and epec) inject a repertoire of effector proteins into host cells via a type iii secretion system (t3ss) encoded by the locus of enterocyte effacement (lee). ospg is an effector protein initially identified in shigella that was shown to inhibit the host innate immune response. in this study, we found ospg homologues in ehec (mainly of serogroup o111) and in yersinia enterocolitica. the t3ss encoded by the lee was able to inject these different ospg homologues into host cells. infection of  hela cells with ehec o111 inhibited the nf-kappab-dependent innate immune response via a t3ss-dependent mechanism. however, an ehec o111 ospg mutant was still able to inhibit nf-kappab p65 transfer to the nucleus in infected cells stimulated by tumour necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha). in addition, no difference in the inflammatory response was observed between wild-type ehec o111  and the isogenic ospg mutant in the rabbit ligated intestinal loop model. these results suggest that ospg is not the sole effector protein involved in the inactivation of the host innate immune system during ehec o111 infection.

AB  == use of antiseptics and disinfectants is essential in infection control practices  in hospital and other healthcare settings. in this study, the in vitro activity of a new promising compound, para-guanidinoethylcalix[4]arene (cx1), has been evaluated in comparison with hexamidine (hx) and chlorhexidine (chx), two older cationic antiseptics. the mics for 69 clinical isolates comprising methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-sensitive s. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons) (with or without meca), vancomycin-resistant enterococci, enterobacteriaceae producing various beta-lactamases and non-fermenting bacilli (pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumanii, stenotrophomonas maltophilia) were determined. cx1 showed similar activity against s. aureus, cons and enterococcus spp., irrespective of the presence of meca or van genes, or associated resistance genes, with very good activity against cons (mic <1 mg/l). variable activities were observed against enterobacteriaceae; the mics determined seemed to be dependent both on the genus  (mics of 2, 8 and 64 mg/l for escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and yersinia enterocolitica, respectively) and on the resistance phenotype production of [extended spectrum beta-lactase (esbls) or other beta-lactamases; overproduction of ampc]. poor activity was found against non-fermenting bacilli,  irrespective of the resistance phenotype. chx appeared to be the most active compound against all strains, with broad-spectrum and conserved activity against  multidrug-resistant strains. hx showed a lower activity, essentially against gram-positive strains. consequently, the differences observed with respect to cx1 suggest that they are certainly not the consequence of antibiotic resistance phenotypes, but rather the result of membrane composition modifications (e.g. of  lipopolysaccharide), or of the presence of (activated) efflux-pumps. these results raise the possibility that cx1 may be a potent new antibacterial agent of somewhat lower activity but significantly lower toxicity than chx.

TI  == transmission of foodborne zoonotic pathogens to riparian areas by grazing sheep.
AB  == the objective of this study was to determine if sheep grazing near riparian areas on pasture in ontario are an important risk factor for the contamination of water with specific foodborne pathogens. ten ontario sheep farms were visited weekly for 12 wk during the summer of 2005. samples of feces, soil, and water were collected and analyzed for the presence of escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella spp., campylobacter jejuni and c. coli, and yersinia enterocolitica, by bacteriological identification and polymerase chain reaction (pcr). the data was  analyzed as repeated measures over time using mixed models. no samples were positive for salmonella, and no samples were confirmed positive for e. coli o157:h7 after pcr. levels of campylobacter were highest in the soil, but did not  differ between soil where sheep grazed or camped and roadside soil that had never been grazed (p = 0.85). levels of yersinia were highest in water samples and were higher in soil where sheep had access (p = 0.01). the prevalence of positive campylobacter and yersinia samples were not associated with locations where sheep spent more time (campylobacter p = 0.46, yersinia p = 0.99). there was no effect  of stocking density on the prevalence of campylobacter (p = 0.30), but as the stocking density increased the levels of yersinia increased (p = 0.04). it was concluded that although sheep transmit yersinia to their environment, pastured sheep flocks are not major risk factors for the transmission of zoonotic pathogens into water.

TI  == determination of emitted airborne microorganisms from a bio-pak wastewater treatment plant.
AB  == results of a study conducted to assess the degree of airborne microbial contamination generated by a wastewater treatment plant (wwtp) with bioreactor "bio-pak" closed treatment system and evaluation of the dispersion of potential pathogens are described. over the year aerosol samples were collected simultaneously with sedimentation and impact methods from several plant sites and the surroundings. external upwind sites were used as control. total colony-forming counts of heterotrophic psychrophilic, psychrotrophic, mesophilic, haemolytic bacteria, as well as members of the enterobacteriaceae family, staphylococcus, enterococcus and pseudomonas genera, actinomycetes and fungi (moulds, yeasts and yeast-like fungi) were determined. their highest concentrations ranged up to 10(1)-10(3)cfu/m(3) (with the exception of moulds exceeding 2x10(4)) were determined in air sampled inside the bioreactor, its vicinity, and near the grate chamber. higher species diversity of the family enterobacteriaceae (including shigella spp., yersinia enterocolitica, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae ozaenae) in the air sampled inside or near the bioreactor may imply a health risk for staff exposed for longer periods of time.  notwithstanding, no increased emission of the analysed groups of microorganisms,  including faecal bacteria, were found outside the wwtp.

TI  == the yersinia pseudotuberculosis ypla phospholipase differs in its activity, regulation and secretion from that of the yersinia enterocolitica ypla.
AB  == analysis of the yersinia pseudotuberculosis and yersinia pestis genomes indicates that both species carry an identical copy of a gene that is predicted to encode a protein which shares 80% similarity to the yersinia enterocolitica ypla, a secreted phospholipase that has been shown to contribute to virulence. in contrast to well tolerated production of the y. enterocolitica ypla in escherichia coli, y. pseudotuberculosis ypla expression was found to be toxic; however, cell viability could be restored if the y. pseudotuberculosis ypla was expressed in the presence of its accessory protein yplb. in vitro, y. pseudotuberculosis yplb was shown to reduce the activity of its cognate phospholipase in a dose-dependent manner. to determine whether the y. pseudotuberculosis and y. enterocolitica yplas were secreted and regulated in a similar manner, secretion and promoter activity assays were performed. unlike the situation apparent in y. enterocolitica, expression of the y. pseudotuberculosis  ypla gene did not appear to be controlled by the flagellar regulon, nor did the phospholipase appear to be efficiently exported through the flagellar apparatus.  these results indicate that the yersinia yplas vary in many of their attributes despite their high degree of amino acid homology.

TI  == eca-immunogenicity of proteus mirabilis strains.
AB  == introduction: bacteria of the genus proteus are opportunistic pathogens and cause mainly urinary tract infections. they also play a role in the pathogenesis of reactive arthritis (ra). patients suffering from yersinia-triggered ra often carry high titers of antibodies specific to enterobacterial common antigen (eca). the immunogenicity of eca has not received much attention thus far and studies have focused mainly on the eca of escherichia coli and yersinia enterocolitica. in this paper the eca-immunogenicity of proteus mirabilis is elucidated using two wild-type strains (s1959 and o28) as well as their rough (r) derivative strains r110/1959, which expresses lipopolysaccharide (lps) with a full core, and r4/o28, which expresses lps with only an inner core. materials and methods: rabbit polyclonal antisera were produced by immunization with boiled suspensions of the  four p. mirabilis strains. the antisera were tested for the presence of antibodies specific to eca by western blotting using glycerophospholipid- linked  eca (eca(pg)) of salmonella montevideo as antigen. lipopolysaccharide (lps) was isolated from the four strains by the hot phenol/water procedure in which eca(pg) is co-extracted with lps and by the phenol/chloroform/petroleum ether extraction  that results in the isolation of lps and/or lps-linked eca (eca(lps)) free of eca(pg). the lps preparations were tested for the presence of eca by western blotting using eca-specific antibodies. results: the results demonstrated that all four p. mirabilis strains were eca immunogenic. the rabbit antisera immunized by the four strains all contained eca-specific antibodies. analysis of the lps preparations demonstrated that the p. mirabilis wild-type strains o28 and s1959 and the ra mutant strain r110/1959 expressed eca(lps), suggesting that it induced the anti-eca antibody responses. only the presence of eca(pg) could be demonstrated in the rc mutant strain r4/o28. conclusions: these results therefore suggest that, similar to e. coli, lps with a full core is also required as the acceptor of eca for p. mirabilis strains to produce eca(lps). since eca(pg) is not immunogenic unless combined with some proteins, it is likely that eca(pg)-protein complexes formed during the intravenous immunization with the rc  mutant strain r4/o28.

TI  == structure and heme binding properties of escherichia coli o157:h7 chux.
AB  == for many pathogenic microorganisms, iron acquisition from host heme sources stimulates growth, multiplication, ultimately enabling successful survival and colonization. in gram-negative escherichia coli o157:h7, shigella dysenteriae and yersinia enterocolitica the genes encoded within the heme utilization operon enable the effective uptake and utilization of heme as an iron source. while the  complement of proteins responsible for heme internalization has been determined in these organisms, the fate of heme once it has reached the cytoplasm has only recently begun to be resolved. here we report the first crystal structure of chux, a member of the conserved heme utilization operon from pathogenic e. coli o157:h7 determined at 2.05 a resolution. chux forms a dimer which remarkably given low sequence homology, displays a very similar fold to the monomer structure of chus and hems, two other heme utilization proteins. absorption spectral analysis of heme reconstituted chux demonstrates that chux binds heme in a 1:1 manner implying that each chux homodimer has the potential to coordinate two heme molecules in contrast to chus and hems where only one heme molecule is bound. resonance raman spectroscopy indicates that the heme of ferric chux is composed of a mixture of coordination states: 5-coordinate and high-spin, 6-coordinate and low-spin, and 6-coordinate and high-spin. in contrast, the reduced ferrous form displays mainly a 5-coordinate and high-spin state with a minor contribution from a 6-coordinate and low-spin state. the nu(fe-co) and nu(c-o) frequencies of chux-bound co fall on the correlation line expected for histidine-coordinated hemoproteins indicating that the fifth axial ligand of the  ferrous heme is the imidazole ring of a histidine residue. based on sequence and  structural comparisons, we designed a number of site-directed mutations in chux to probe the heme binding sites and dimer interface. spectral analysis of chux and mutants suggests involvement of h65 and h98 in heme coordination as mutations of both residues were required to abolish the formation of the hexacoordination state of heme-bound chux.

TI  == hada is an atypical new multifunctional trimeric coiled-coil adhesin of haemophilus influenzae biogroup aegyptius, which promotes entry into host cells.
AB  == the oca (oligomeric coiled-coil adhesin) family is a subgroup of the bacterial trimeric autotransporter adhesins, which includes structurally related proteins,  such as yada of yersinia enterocolitica and nada of neisseria meningitidis. in this study, we searched in silico for novel members of this family in bacterial genomes and identified hada (haemophilus adhesin a), a trimeric autotransporter expressed only by haemophilus influenzae biogroup aegyptius causing brazilian purpuric fever (bpf), a fulminant septicemic disease of children. by comparative  genomics and sequence analysis we predicted that the hada gene is harboured on a  mobile genetic element unique to bpf isolates. biological analysis of hada in the native background was limited because this organism is not amenable to genetic manipulation. alternatively, we demonstrated that expression of hada confers to a non-invasive escherichia coli strain the ability to adhere to human cells and to  extracellular matrix proteins and to induce in vitro bacterial aggregation and microcolony formation. intriguingly, hada is predicted to lack the typical n-terminal head domain of oca proteins generally associated with cellular receptor binding. we propose here a structural model of the hada coiled-coil stalk and show that the n-terminal region is still responsible of the binding activity and a kgd motif plays a role. interestingly, hada promotes bacterial entry into mammalian cells. our results show a cytoskeleton re-arrangement and an involvement of clathrin in the hada-mediated internalization. these data give new insights on the structure-function relationship of oligomeric coiled-coil adhesins and suggest a potential role of this protein in the pathogenesis of bpf.

TI  == hybrid gravitational field-flow fractionation using immunofunctionalized walls for integrated bioanalytical devices.
AB  == in this work, the biospecific recognition antigen-antibody reaction was implemented in gravitational field-flow fractionation (grfff), a flow-assisted separation technique for micron-sized particles, in order to realize a hybrid immunomodulated grfff system in which two different principles are combined to achieve highly versatile fractionation. micron-sized polystyrene beads coated with horseradish peroxidase (hrp) were used as a model sample, and anti-hrp antibodies were immobilized on the accumulation wall of the grfff channel. ultrasensitive chemiluminescence imaging was employed to visualize the beads during elution and to optimize experimental conditions. the same principle was then applied to real biological samples composed by yersinia enterocolitica and escherichia coli cells. results show the possibility to modify the elution of selected sample components and even to retain them into the channel. the hybrid immunomodulated grfff system is a step towards the development of a module that could be integrated in a lab-on-a-chip-based point-of-care testing device which includes sample pre-analytical cleanup and analysis.

TI  == control of foodborne pathogens and soft-rot bacteria on bell pepper by three strains of bacterial antagonists.
AB  == forty-two representative strains of native bacteria associated with fresh peeled  baby carrots were isolated and characterized. two of these strains, identified as pseudomonas fluorescens ag3a (pf ag3a) and bacillus yd1, were evaluated in conjunction with another known antagonist, p. fluorescens 2-79 (pf 2-79), for their potential as biocontrol agents of human pathogens (listeria monocytogenes,  yersinia enterocolitica, salmonella enterica, and escherichia coli o157:h7) and soft-rot bacteria (erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora, pseudomonas marginalis,  and pseudomonas viridiflava). when grown on iron-deficient agar media, all three  antagonists produced inhibition zones up to 25 mm in diameter against the growth  of human pathogens and soft-rot bacteria. however, when grown on iron-rich agar media, only pf 2-79 and bacillus yd1 exhibited antimicrobial activity. treatment  of bell pepper disks with pf 2-79 or bacillus yd1 reduced the growth of pathogen  by 1.4 to 4.1 log units, depending upon the ratio of the number of antagonist cells to pathogen cells (1:1, 10:1, 100:1, or 1,000:1). the greatest reduction was observed when 10- to 100-fold higher number of antagonists than pathogens was applied. pf ag3a and bacillus yd1 reduced the growth of pathogens on pepper disks at 20 degrees c but not at 10 degrees c. however, pf 2-79 reduced the growth of l. monocytogenes and y. enterocolitica by up to 4 log units at either 20 or 10 degrees c. treatment of pepper disks with pf 2-79 also reduced the incidence of soft rot induced by soft-rot bacteria by 40 to 70%. pf 2-79 is the most effective of the three antagonists tested for control of spoilage bacteria and human pathogens on bell pepper.

TI  == factors related to the carriage of verocytotoxigenic e. coli, salmonella, thermophilic campylobacter and yersinia enterocolitica in cattle, sheep and pigs  at slaughter.
AB  == a 12-month abattoir study was undertaken from january 2003. we collected 7492 intestinal samples from cattle, sheep and pigs at slaughter. rectal samples were  taken from cattle and sheep and caecal samples from pigs. they were examined for  verocytotoxigenic e. coli (vtec) o157, salmonella, thermophilic campylobacter and yersinia enterocolitica. data were collected on the animal from which the sample  came and this information was analysed to look at potential risk factors for carriage of these organisms. logistic regression models were run where an adequate number of positive results were available. this revealed that vtec o157  carriage in cattle was associated with the summer period and that age was a protective factor. salmonella carriage in pigs was associated with lairage times  >12 h, the north east and not feeding when there was no bedding available. in cattle, carriage was associated with the summer period, the eastern region of gb  and dairy animals. in sheep a spring seasonal effect was seen, which coincided with the lambing period. the carriage of thermophilic campylobacter in cattle was associated with single-species abattoirs, with age a protective factor. in sheep, winter was a risk period with lairage management influential. for pigs, lairage times of <12 h were found to be associated with carriage. a seasonal trend for carriage of y. enterocolitica in all species was demonstrated with the period december-may a risk. for cattle, age was also a risk factor; for sheep feeding in the lairage and for pigs being held overnight were risk factors.

TI  == role of oxygen tension on the transport and retention of two pathogenic bacteria  in saturated porous media.
AB  == to examine the influence of variations in the dissolved oxygen (do) concentration on pathogen mobility, laboratory-scale filtration experiments were performed using the enterohemorrhagic strain escherichia coli o157:h7 and the enteroinvasive organism yersinia enterocolitica. cells were incubated either in the absence (anaerobic) or in the presence (aerobic) of oxygen to understand how  these two growth conditions may affect bacterial transport and retention in water-saturated granular porous media. the influence of do during growth is found to be organism dependent, whereby e. coli o157:h7 exhibits decreased transport potential when grown in the presence of 02 and y. enterocolitica exhibits greater transport when grown aerobically. to understand the influence of do changes during cell acclimation and transport, bacteria were resuspended and acclimated in either oxygen-depleted (low do) or oxygen-rich (saturated do) electrolytes prior to conduction of filtration experiments. the effect of do on bacterial transport and retention is shown to be dependent on the antecedent growth conditions and on the organism studied. measurements of the cell surface charge,  shape, and size reveal some variability when the oxygen tension is changed during bacterial growth or acclimation and are linked to the observed bacterial transport behavior.

AB  == background: we studied the etiology of acute gastroenteritis in a village with a  total population of approximately 6,000. this is the first study in austria that  has investigated a broad range of pathogens recovered from an unselected population of patients who had consulted general practitioners because of gastroenteritis. materials and methods: in 2007, all patients who visited one of  three local general practitioners for acute gastroenteritis were invited to provide stool specimens to be tested for salmonella, shigella, campylobacter, enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli (ehec) (mtsb enrichment [r-biopharm] followed  by toxin elisa plus culture), enteropathogenic e. coli (epec), yersinia, vibrio cholerae, clostridium difficile (toxin plus culture), rotavirus plus adenovirus (rida) quick rotavirus/adenovirus combi test), giardia duodenalis plus cryptosporidium parvum (rida) quick cryptosporidium/giardia combi test), astrovirus (elisa), and norovirus (reverse-transcriptase pcr). results: stool specimens were provided by 306 patients (161 female) with acute diarrhea. the ages of the patients ranged from 1 to 89 years (mean 37, median 36). pathogens were detected in 71 (23.2%) patients, with incidence peaks in february and june.  norovirus accounted for 36.0% of positive results, c. difficile for 18.7%, rotavirus for 17.3%, campylobacter for 9.3%, salmonella for 6.6%, adenovirus for  5.4%, g. duodenalis and c. parvum for 2.7% each, and yersinia enterocolitica for  1.3%. no cases of shigellosis or infection with ehec, epec, or astrovirus were diagnosed. viruses accounted for 58.7% of the 75 positive results, bacteria for 36.0%, and parasites for 5.3%. conclusion: our study underlines a dominant role of norovirus and toxigenic c. difficile as etiologic agents of acute gastroenteritis among the patients of general practitioners.

AB  == no cause of one-third of travelers' diarrhea (td) cases can be detected despite microbiologic assessment. we propose that these pathogen-negative td cases include undetected enterotoxigenic escherichia coli (etec). as a standard in diagnostic microbiology, samples of five e. coli colonies were tested to detect etec from stool cultures. we compared the sensitivities and the number of etec detected by 20 colonies with those of 5, 10, and 15 colonies. the percent detection of etec with five e. coli colonies was significantly different from that using 20 e. coli colonies. of the 116 subjects studied, the number positive  for etec for 5, 10, 15 and 20 colonies tested were 22 (19.0%), 37 (31.9%), 45 (38.8%) and 46 (39.7%), respectively. based on our results, we recommend the testing of at least 10 e. coli colonies for optimum detection of etec in patients with td.

TI  == sideromycins: tools and antibiotics.
AB  == sideromycins are antibiotics covalently linked to siderophores. they are actively transported into gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. energy-coupled transport across the outer membrane and the cytoplasmic membrane strongly increases their antibiotic efficiency; their minimal inhibitory concentration is  at least 100-fold lower than that of antibiotics that enter cells by diffusion. this is particularly relevant for gram-negative bacteria because the outer membrane, which usually forms a permeability barrier, in this case actively contributes to the uptake of sideromycins. sideromycin-resistant mutants can be used to identify siderophore transport systems since the mutations are usually in transport genes. two sideromycins, albomycin and salmycin, are discussed here. albomycin, a derivative of ferrichrome with a bound thioribosyl-pyrimidine moiety, inhibts seryl-t-rna synthetase. salmycin, a ferrioxamine derivative with  a bound aminodisaccharide, presumably inhibts protein synthesis. crystal structures of albomycin bound to the outer membrane transporter fhua and the periplasmic binding protein fhud have been determined. albomycin and salmycin have been used to characterize the transport systems of escherichia coli and streptococcus pneumoniae and of staphylococcus aureus, respectively. the in vivo  efficacy of albomycin and salmycin has been examined in a mouse model using yersinia enterocolitica, s. pneumoniae, and s. aureus infections. albomycin is effective in clearing infections, whereas salmycin is too unstable to lead to a large reduction in bacterial numbers. the recovery rate of albomycin-resistant mutants is lower than that of the wild-type, which suggests a reduced fitness of  the mutants. albomycin could be a useful antibiotic provided sufficient quantities can be isolated from streptomycetes or synthesized chemically.

TI  == transport of selected bacterial pathogens in agricultural soil and quartz sand.
AB  == the protection of groundwater supplies from microbial contamination necessitates  a solid understanding of the key factors controlling the migration and retention  of pathogenic organisms through the subsurface environment. the transport behavior of five waterborne pathogens was examined using laboratory-scale columns packed with clean quartz at two solution ionic strengths (10 mm and 30 mm). escherichia coli o157:h7 and yersinia enterocolitica were selected as representative gram-negative pathogens, enterococcus faecalis was selected as a representative gram-positive organism, and two cyanobacteria (microcystis aeruginosa and anabaena flos-aquae) were also studied. the five organisms exhibit differing attachment efficiencies to the quartz sand. the surface (zeta) potential of the microorganisms was characterized over a broad range of ph values (2-8) at two ionic strengths (10 mm and 30 mm). these measurements are used to evaluate the observed attachment behavior within the context of the dlvo theory of colloidal stability. to better understand the possible link between bacterial  transport in model quartz sand systems and natural soil matrices, additional experiments were conducted with two of the selected organisms using columns packed with loamy sand obtained from an agricultural field. this investigation highlights the need for further characterization of waterborne pathogen surface properties and transport behavior over a broader range of environmentally relevant conditions.

TI  == inactivation of escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes and yersinia enterocolitica in fermented sausages during maturation/storage.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to evaluate maturation and storage conditions as a  way to increase the safety of non-heat treated fermented sausages. the specific objectives were to investigate the effects of storage time and temperature on the levels of escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes and yersinia enterocolitica in fermented sausages and in broth, and to validate how well the broth experiments and some published models can predict inactivation in sausage. one strain each of e. coli, l. monocytogenes and y. enterocolitica with induced acid tolerance was inoculated into sausage batters representing a typical swedish recipe for cold-smoked sausages. the sausages were fermented at 27 degrees c for 39 or 48 h  and then stored at different temperatures (8, 15, or 20-22 degrees c) for up to 44 days. the levels of the experimental strains, lactic acid bacteria, and ph, a(w), and lactic acid was measured during the maturation/storage period. inactivation in bhi broths adjusted to ph 4.4 or 4.6, water activity of 0.93, and with 1, 1.3 or 2% lactic acid added was also studied. for all strains inactivation rates increased with temperature in both broths and sausages. at 8 degrees c the storage time required for a one-log reduction in sausage ranged from 21 days for e. coli, >16 days for l. monocytogenes, to 18 days for y. enterocolitica. at temperatures of 20 degrees c or more, the storage time needed  for a one log reduction was shorter: between 7 to 11 days for e. coli, 4 to 7 days for l. monocytogenes, and 1 to 4 days for y. enterocolitica. a published model based on temperature only yielded a good prediction of e. coli inactivation in sausage. a linear model based on the rate estimated in broth yielded a fair prediction of l. monocytogenes inactivation. the performance of other inactivation models validated was unsatisfactory. significant e. coli growth which occurred in batters without salt during initial phases of fermentation resulted in a subsequent increased inactivation rate, possibly due to increased susceptibility to stress of exponential phase bacteria. the results indicate that the practice of utilising a short maturation period and storage at refrigeration  temperatures may result in unsatisfactory reductions of pathogens if present. thus, inclusion of a maturation period above refrigeration temperatures before distribution may increase the safety of these products.

AB  == the magnitude of bacterial diarrhea in developing countries is largely unknown because affordable detection methods are not available. we have developed a polymerase chain reaction (pcr)-based assay for use in areas with limited resources to screen for diarrheogenic strains from clinical isolates. to simplify the assay and minimize reagents, our method implemented the use of plasmids rather than bacteria as template controls and the use of bacterial suspensions or crude dna preparations rather than purified genomic dna as template dna. the assay consisted of 3 pcr reactions using 3 groups of 5 to 6 primer pairs to identify the 11 most common bacterial diarrheogenic pathogens. the 3-reaction multiplex pcr amplifies dna targets specific for each 1 of the 6 escherichia coli diarrheogenic strains and the 5 non-e. coli diarrheogenic strains, including salmonella spp., shigella spp., campylobacter spp., yersinia enterocolitica, and  vibrio cholerae. the assay may provide an important epidemiologic tool to investigate the role of diarrheogenic bacterial pathogens in areas of the world with limited resources.

TI  == the yersinia pseudotuberculosis and yersinia pestis toxin complex is active against cultured mammalian cells.
AB  == the toxin complex (tc) genes were first identified in the insect pathogen photorhabdus luminescens and encode approximately 1 mda protein complexes which are toxic to insect pests. subsequent genome sequencing projects have revealed the presence of tc orthologues in a range of bacterial pathogens known to be associated with insects. interestingly, members of the mammalian-pathogenic yersiniae have also been shown to encode tc orthologues. studies in yersinia enterocolitica have shown that divergent tc loci either encode insect-active toxins or play a role in colonization of the gut in gastroenteritis models of rats. so far little is known about the activity of the tc proteins in the other mammalian-pathogenic yersiniae. here we present work to suggest that tc proteins  in yersinia pseudotuberculosis and yersinia pestis are not insecticidal toxins but have evolved for mammalian pathogenicity. we show that tc is secreted by y. pseudotuberculosis strain ip32953 during growth in media at 28 degrees c and 37 degrees c. we also demonstrate that oral toxicity of strain ip32953 to manduca sexta larvae is not due to tc expression and that lysates of escherichia coli bl21 expressing the yersinia tc proteins are not toxic to sf9 insect cells but are toxic to cultured mammalian cell lines. cell lysates of e. coli bl21 expressing the y. pseudotuberculosis tc proteins caused actin ruffles, vacuoles and multi-nucleation in cultured human gut cells (caco-2); similar morphology was observed after application of a lysate of e. coli bl21 expressing the y. pestis tc proteins to mouse fibroblast nih3t3 cells, but not caco-2 cells. finally, transient expression of the individual tc proteins in caco-2 and nih3t3 cell lines reproduced the actin and nuclear rearrangement observed with the topical applications. together these results add weight to the growing hypothesis that the tc proteins in y. pseudotuberculosis and y. pestis have been adapted for mammalian pathogenicity. we further conclude that tc proteins from y. pseudotuberculosis and y. pestis display differential mammalian cell specificity  in their toxicity.

AB  == use of hog (sus scrofa) manure as a fertilizer is a practical solution for waste  re-utilization, however, it may serve as a vehicle for environmental and domestic animal contamination. work was conducted to determine whether pathogens, naturally present in hog manure could be detected in cattle (bos taurus) grazed on the manure-treated pasture, and whether forage contamination occurred. during  two 3 mo summer trials manure was applied to yield < or = 124 kg available n per  hectare in a single spring or split spring and fall application. samples of hog manure, forage, soil, and cattle feces were analyzed for naturally occurring salmonella, yersinia enterocolitica, and escherichia coli. to follow movement of  salmonella in the environment isolates were identified to serovar and serotyped.  transfer of e. coli from hog manure to soil and cattle was examined by randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) analysis of >600 e. coli isolates. while y. enterocolitica was absent from all samples, in both years s. enterica derby and s. enterica krefeld were found in most hog manure samples, but were only on forage samples in the second year. salmonella enterica typhimurium, absent from hog manure was present on some forage in the first year. cattle feces and soil samples were consistently salmonella negative. these contaminations could not be  traced to manure application. during this study, salmonella and e. coli found in  hog manure had different rapd genomic profiles from those found in the feces of cattle grazing on manure-treated pasture.

AB  == a microarray technique for the detection and identification of enteropathogenic bacteria at the species and subspecies levels was developed in this study, and the target bacteria included pathogenic escherichia coli, vibrio cholerae, vibrio parahaemolyticus, salmonella enterica, campylobacter jejuni, shigellae, yersinia  enterocolitica, and listeria monocytogenes. the virulence gene of each pathogen was chosen as the amplification target, labeled with a fluorescence dye by multiplex polymerase chain reaction (pcr), and hybridized to the specific virulence gene probes that had been immobilized on a microchip. stool specimens from 34 patients with diarrhea were tested in this study. five were positive for  multiple genera. nested pcrs and sequencing were used to amplify and identify the related genes, which were found to share 95.8% to 100% of the nucleotide identity with the corresponding regions in the genbank database. real-time pcr was used to determine the number of gene copies to determine the sensitivity of this technique, which was shown to be 58 copies/microl. the results indicated that the microarray technique which targets multiple virulence genes of enteropathogenic bacteria at the species and subspecies levels is an attractive diagnostic tool for rapidly and simultaneously identifying multiple enteropathogenic pathogens in clinical practice, especially in patients with infectious diarrhea.

TI  == antimicrobial effects of turkish propolis, pollen, and laurel on spoilage and pathogenic food-related microorganisms.
AB  == the antimicrobial activities of propolis extract, pollen extract, and essential oil of laurel (laurus nobilis l.) at concentrations from 0.02% to 2.5% (vol/vol)  were investigated on bacteria (bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, staphylococcus aureus, yersinia enterocolitica, enterococcus faecalis, and listeria monocytogenes), yeasts (saccharomyces cerevisiae and candida rugosa), and molds (aspergillus niger and rhizopus oryzae). pollen has no antimicrobial effects on the bacteria and fungi tested in  the concentrations used. propolis showed a bactericidal effect at 0.02% on b. cereus and b. subtilis, at 1.0% on s. aureus and e. faecalis, and at 0.2% on l. monocytogenes. the minimum inhibitory concentration of propolis for fungi was 2.5%. propolis and laurel were ineffective against e. coli and s. typhimurium at  the concentrations tested. the results showed that the antimicrobial activity were concentration dependent. propolis and essential oil of laurel may be used as biopreservative agents in food processing and preservation.

TI  == effects of pulsed electric fields on pathogenic microorganisms of major concern in fluid foods: a review.
AB  == pathogenic microorganisms such as escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella spp., listeria monocytogenes, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, yersinia enterocolitica, and campylobacter jejuni have been implicated in foodborne diseases and outbreaks worldwide. these bacteria have been associated with the consumption of fresh fruit juices, milk, and dairy products, which are foodstuff, highly demanded by consumers in retails and supermarkets. nowadays, consumers require high quality, fresh-like, and safe foods. pulsed electric field (pef) is  a non-thermal preservation method, able to inactivate pathogenic microorganisms without significant loss of the organoleptic and nutritional properties of food.  the pef treatment effectiveness to destroy bacteria such as listeria innocua, e.  coli, salmonella typhimurium, e. coli o157:h7 and e. coli 8739 at pasteurization  levels (> or = 5.0 log(10) cycles) in some fluid foods was reported. however, data on the inactivation of some microorganisms such as bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, yersinia enterocolitica, and campylobacter jejuni in fluid foods by pef processing is very limited. therefore, future works should be focused toward the inactivation of these pathogenic bacteria in real foods.

TI  == transcriptome analysis of organisms with food safety relevance.
AB  == transcriptome analysis using microarrays has become a powerful tool to better understand the process of disease and other complex biological processes such as  food spoilage and biofilm formation. this review is divided into two basic sections: 1) a short history and description of microarrays and 2) a discussion of studies involving bacterial food safety pathogens that focused on whole genome transcript analysis. not included are the many studies using microarrays to identify, diagnose, or genetically characterize these organisms. this review focuses on studies involving escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella spp., campylobacter jejuni, listeria monocytogenes, and yersinia enterocolitica. many of the studies involve altering the growth environment to simulate stress conditions and the use of host-pathogen model systems to explore virulence mechanisms. few studies use conditions that might be considered unique to the food industry. exceptions are studies of biofilm-specific transcriptome changes and analysis following pressure treatment. this review should not be considered as a comprehensive review, and where appropriate, species-specific reviews are cited that are more complete.

TI  == automated error-tolerant macromolecular structure determination from multidimensional nuclear overhauser enhancement spectra and chemical shift assignments: improved robustness and performance of the pasd algorithm.
AB  == we report substantial improvements to the previously introduced automated noe assignment and structure determination protocol known as pasd (kuszewski et al. (2004) j am chem soc 26:6258-6273). the improved protocol includes extensive analysis of input spectral data to create a low-resolution contact map of residues expected to be close in space. this map is used to obtain reasonable initial guesses of noe assignment likelihoods which are refined during subsequent structure calculations. information in the contact map about which residues are predicted to not be close in space is applied via conservative repulsive distance restraints which are used in early phases of the structure calculations. in comparison with the previous protocol, the new protocol requires significantly less computation time. we show results of running the new pasd protocol on six proteins and demonstrate that useful assignment and structural information is extracted on proteins of more than 220 residues. we show that useful assignment information can be obtained even in the case in which a unique structure cannot be determined.

TI  == simultaneous detection of six human diarrheal pathogens by using dna microarray combined with tyramide signal amplification.
AB  == multiplex pcr and dna microarray were combined with tyramide signal amplification (tsa) to develop a reliable method suitable for simultaneous detection of six species of human diarrheal pathogens (yersinia enterocolitica, shigella spp, salmonella typhi, brucella spp, vibrio cholera and escherichia coli o157:h7). meanwhile, our method could distinguish v. cholera serotype o1 from o139, and o157:h7 from o157: non-h7. this assay conferred a specificity of 100% for target  pathogens. the limit of detection was 103 degrees cfu/ml approximately. the results of 98.6% (357/362) clinical specimens and 100% (5/5) mocked double-blind  samples were the same to that from conventional assay. consequently this assay is sensitive and a specific tool suitable for diagnostic detection and surveillance  of multiple human pathogens.

TI  == overview of the inactivation by 254 nm ultraviolet radiation of bacteria with particular relevance to biodefense.
AB  == our goal was to ultimately predict the sensitivity of untested bacteria (including those of biodefense interest) to ultraviolet (uv) radiation. in this study, we present an overview and analysis of the relevant 254 nm data previously reported and available in the literature. the amount of variability in this data  prevented us from determining an "average" response for any bacterium. therefore, we developed particular selection criteria to include the data in our analysis and suggested future guidelines for reporting uv sensitivity results. we then compiled a table of the sensitivity to 254 nm uv for 38 bacteria and three bacterial spores. the uv sensitivity was quite similar (within 10%) among the spores of bacillus anthracis (strains vollum 1b and sterne), bacillus subtilis, and bacillus megaterium. these data indicate that spores of b. subtilis and b. megaterium could be adequate simulants of b. anthracis spores in uvc experiments. spores of b. anthracis, b. subtilis and b. megaterium were 5-10 times more resistant to uv than were their corresponding vegetative cells. the vegetative cells of b. anthracis showed similar uv sensitivity to those of burkholderia pseudomallei, shigella sonnei, and a wild-type strain of escherichia coli. yersinia enterocolitica and vibrio cholerae appeared more sensitive to uv and salmonella typhi slightly more resistant to uv than e. coli. the sensitivity (at  254 nm) of all vegetative bacteria ranged from 11 to 80 jm(2) for a 1 log(10) kill and from 25-200 jm(2) for 4 log(10) kill.

TI  == structure-function relationships in escherichia coli adenylate cyclase.
AB  == class i adenylate cyclases are found in gamma- and delta-proteobacteria. they play central roles in processes such as catabolite repression in escherichia coli or development of full virulence in pathogens such as yersinia enterocolitica and vibrio vulnificus. the catalytic domain (residues 2-446) of the adenylate cyclase of e. coli was overexpressed and purified. it displayed a v(max) of 665 nmol of camp x mg(-1) x min(-1) and a k(m) of 270 microm. titration of the metal cofactor mg(2+) against the substrate atp showed a requirement for free metal ions in addition to the mgatp complex, suggesting a two-metal-ion mechanism as is known for class ii and class iii adenylate cyclases. twelve residues which are essential for catalysis were identified by mutagenesis of a total of 20 polar residues conserved in all class i adenylate cyclases. five essential residues (ser(103), ser(113), asp(114), asp(116) and trp(118)) were part of a region which is found in all members of the large dna polymerase beta-like nucleotidyltransferase superfamily. alignment of the e. coli adenylate cyclase with the crystal structure of a distant member of the superfamily, archaeal trna  cca-adding enzyme, suggested that asp(114) and asp(116) are the metal-cofactor-ion-binding residues. the s103a mutant had a 17-fold higher k(m) than wild-type, demonstrating its important role in substrate binding. in comparison with the trna cca-adding enzyme, ser(103) of the e. coli adenylate cyclase apparently binds the gamma-phosphate group of atp. consistent with this function, the s103a mutation caused a marked reduction of discrimination between  atp- and adp- or amp-derived inhibitors.

TI  == prevalence of yersinia enterocolitica in market weight hogs in the united states.
AB  == pigs are the major animal reservoir for yersinia enterocolitica strains, which are potentially pathogenic for humans. the goals of this study were (i) to estimate the individual animal and on-farm prevalences of y. enterocolitica in hogs based on tonsil samples collected during national animal health monitoring system swine 2002 study and (ii) to use these data with data previously published for fecal samples to determine on-farm risk factors for y. enterocolitica. tonsil swabs (1,218) and fecal samples (2,847) were collected on 124 farms located in the top 17 pork-producing states. ten percent of tonsils (122 of 1,218 samples) were positive in irgasan-tiracillin-chlorate (itc) enrichment broth by real-time  pcr, but only 5.6% of samples (68 of 1,218) were positive after subculture on the more selective cefsulodin-irgasan-novobiocin (cin) agar. for tonsils, the on-farm prevalence based on real-time pcr detection of the ail gene in itc enrichment broth cultures was 32% (32 of 100 premises sampled); the prevalence based on subculture in cin agar was 19.6% (20 of 102 premises). results of bacteriological isolation and real-time pcr analysis of tonsils and feces were combined to estimate prevalence (individual animal and farm), which was subsequently correlated with 40 farm management practices. four factors and their accompanying odds ratios (ors) were identified in the final regression model: location in a central state (or = 0.3), vaccination for escherichia coli (or = 3.0), percentage of deaths due to scours (or = 3.5), and presence of meat or bone meal in grower-finisher diet (or = 4.1).

TI  == combined physico-chemical treatments based on enterocin as-48 for inactivation of gram-negative bacteria in soybean sprouts.
AB  == enterocin as-48 was tested for decontamination of soybean sprouts against gram-negative bacteria. although treatment with bacteriocin alone had no effect on salmonella enterica, a synergistic antimicrobial effect was detected at ph 9.0 and in combination with moderate heat treatment. greatest inactivation was achieved for sprouts heated for 5 min at 65 degrees c in an alkaline (ph 9.0) enterocin as-48 solution of 25 microg/ml. bactericidal activity against s. enterica increased greatly when enterocin as-48 was used in washing solutions in  combination with several chemical compounds: edta, lactic acid, peracetic acid, polyphosphoric acid, sodium hypochlorite, hexadecylpyridinium chloride, propyl-p-hydroxybenzoate, and hydrocinnamic acid. the combined treatment of enterocin as-48 and polyphosphoric acid was tested against several other gram-negative bacteria inoculated on sprouts. the bacteria tested showed great differences in sensitivity to polyphosphoric acid, but synergism with enterocin as-48 was confirmed in all cases. combinations of enterocin as-48 (25 microg/ml)  and polyphosphoric acid in a concentration range of 0.1 to 2.0% significantly reduced or inhibited growth of the populations of s. enterica, escherichia coli o157:h7, shigella spp., enterobacter aerogenes, yersinia enterocolitica, aeromonas hydrophila and pseudomonas fluorescens in sprout samples stored at 6 degrees c and 15 degrees c. the combined treatment could therefore be applied to  reduce the risks of gram-negative pathogenic as well as spoilage bacteria on sprouts.

TI  == analysis and classification of bacteria by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry and a chemometric approach.
AB  == matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms) is a useful technique for the identification of bacteria on the basis of their characteristic protein mass spectrum fingerprint. highly standardized instrumental analytical performance and bacterial culture conditions are required to achieve useful information. a chemometric approach based on multivariate analysis techniques was developed for the analysis of maldi data of  different bacteria to allow their identification from their fingerprint. principal component analysis, linear discriminant analysis (lda) and soft independent modelling of class analogy (simca) were applied to the analysis of the maldi ms mass spectra of two pathogenic bacteria, escherichia coli o157:h7 and yersinia enterocolitica, and the non-pathogenic e. coli mc1061. spectra variability was assessed by growing bacteria in different media and analysing them at different culture growth times. after selection of the relevant variables, which allows the evaluation of an m/z value pattern with high discriminant power, the identification of bacteria by lda and simca was performed independently of the experimental conditions used. in order to better evaluate the analytical performance of the approach used, the ability to correctly classify different bacteria, six wild-type strains of e. coli o157:h7, was also studied and a combination of different chemometric techniques with a severe validation was developed. the analysis of spiked bovine meat samples and the agreement with an independent chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay demonstrated the applicability of the method developed for the detection of bacteria in real samples. the easy automation of the maldi method and the ability of multivariate  techniques to reduce interlaboratory variability associated with bacterial growth time and conditions suggest the usefulness of the proposed maldi ms approach for  rapid routine food safety checks.

TI  == contribution of trimeric autotransporter c-terminal domains of oligomeric coiled-coil adhesin (oca) family members yada, uspa1, eiba, and hia to translocation of the yada passenger domain and virulence of yersinia enterocolitica.
AB  == the oca family is a novel class of autotransporter-adhesins with highest structural similarity in their c-terminal transmembrane region, which supposedly  builds a beta-barrel pore in the outer membrane (om). the prototype of the oca family is yada, an adhesin of yersinia enterocolitica and yersinia pseudotuberculosis. yada forms a homotrimeric lollipop-like structure on the bacterial surface. the c-terminal regions of three yada monomers form a barrel in the om and translocate the trimeric n-terminal passenger domain, consisting of stalk, neck, and head region to the exterior. to elucidate the structural and functional role of the c-terminal translocator domain (tld) and to assess its promiscuous capability with respect to transport of related passenger domains, we constructed chimeric yada proteins, which consist of the n-terminal yada passenger domain and c-terminal tlds of oca family members uspa1 (moraxella catarrhalis), eiba (escherichia coli), and hia (haemophilus influenzae). these constructs were expressed in y. enterocolitica and compared for om localization,  surface exposure, oligomerization, adhesion properties, serum resistance, and mouse virulence. we demonstrate that all chimeric yada proteins translocated the  yada passenger domain across the om. y. enterocolitica strains producing yada chimeras or wild-type yada showed comparable binding to collagen and epithelial cells. however, strains producing yada chimeras were attenuated in serum resistance and mouse virulence. these results demonstrate for the first time that tlds of oca proteins of different origin are efficient translocators of the yada  passenger domain and that the cognate tld of yada is essential for bacterial survival in human serum and mouse virulence.

TI  == a global modulatory role for the yersinia enterocolitica h-ns protein.
AB  == the h-ns protein plays a significant role in the modulation of gene expression in gram-negative bacteria. whereas isolation and characterization of hns mutants in  escherichia coli, salmonella and shigella represented critical steps to gain insight into the modulatory role of h-ns, it has hitherto not been possible to isolate hns mutants in yersinia. the hns mutation is considered to be deleterious in this genus. to study the modulatory role of h-ns in yersinia we circumvented hns lethality by expressing in y. enterocolitica a truncated h-ns protein known to exhibit anti-h-ns activity in e. coli (h-nst(epec)). y. enterocolitica cells expressing h-nst(epec) showed an altered growth rate and several differences in the protein expression pattern, including the prov protein, which is modulated by h-ns in other enteric bacteria. to further confirm that h-nst(epec) expression in yersinia can be used to demonstrate h-ns-dependent regulation in this genus, we used this approach to show that h-ns modulates expression of the ymoa protein.

TI  == the importance of the rcs phosphorelay in the survival and pathogenesis of the enteropathogenic yersiniae.
AB  == the human-pathogenic yersiniae represent an ideal species group to study the evolution of highly virulent bacteria, with yersinia pestis having emerged from the enteropathogen y. pseudotuberculosis an estimated 20 000 years ago. sequence  data reveal that the y. pestis genome is in the early stages of decay and contains hundreds of non-functioning pseudogenes, some of which may be important  in the enteric lifestyle of y. pseudotuberculosis. bioinformatic analysis of pseudogenes from seven y. pestis genome sequences identified rcsd as a gene disrupted early in the evolution of this organism. this phosphotransfer protein is part the of the rcs phosphorelay, a two-component system present in the enterobacteriaceae which has been shown to regulate the expression of capsular polysaccharide and other virulence determinants in several species including escherichia coli and salmonella. using microarray analysis, we determined that the y. pseudotuberculosis rcs phosphorelay regulates the expression of 136 coding sequences, of which 60 % are predicted to affect the cell envelope. several putative virulence determinants were identified as being regulated by this phosphorelay, along with proteins involved in biofilm formation, motility, mammalian cell adhesion and stress survival. phenotypic assays on defined mutants confirmed a role for the phosphorelay in these processes in both y. pseudotuberculosis and y. enterocolitica.

AB  == preclinical safety studies that are required for the marketing approval of a pharmaceutical include single and repeat dose studies in rodent and nonrodent species. the use of nonhuman primates (nhps), primarily macaques, as the nonrodent species has increased in recent years, in part due to the increase in development of biopharmaceuticals and immunomodulatory agents. depending on the source of the macaques, they may vary in genetic background, normal flora, and/or the incidence of preexisting pathogens and inflammatory conditions. as the use of alternative sources of macaques rises to meet the increased demand for these animals in biomedical research, the toxicologic pathologist should be well versed in nhp pathology to adequately assess potential drug-related effects in the context of these variations. such knowledge is particularly important in studies  involving immunomodulatory drugs as the toxicologic pathologist should anticipate which type(s) of infections are most likely to arise depending on which arm of the immune system is modulated. the purpose of this review is to discuss the immunosuppressive (e.g., simian type d retrovirus, simian immunodeficiency virus) and opportunistic viruses (e.g., cytomegalovirus, adenovirus, simian virus 40, rhesus rhadinovirus, and lymphocryptovirus), primary and opportunistic bacteria (e.g., campylobacter spp., shigella flexneri, yersinia enterocolitica, moraxella  catarrhalis, mycobacterium avium complex, enteropathogenic escherichia coli), and parasites (e.g., plasmodium spp., schistosoma spp., strongyloides fulleborni) that have had the most profound impact on the interpretation of drug safety studies and/or that may reemerge as alternative sources of nhps are used for drug safety studies.

TI  == structural and mutational analysis of the cell division protein ftsq.
AB  == bacterial cytokinesis requires the divisome, a complex of proteins that co-ordinates the invagination of the cytoplasmic membrane, inward growth of the peptidoglycan layer and the outer membrane. assembly of the cell division proteins is tightly regulated and the order of appearance at the future division  site is well organized. ftsq is a highly conserved component of the divisome among bacteria that have a cell wall, where it plays a central role in the assembly of early and late cell division proteins. here, we describe the crystal  structure of the major, periplasmic domain of ftsq from escherichia coli and yersinia enterocolitica. the crystal structure reveals two domains; the alpha-domain has a striking similarity to polypeptide transport-associated (potra) domains and the c-terminal beta-domain forms an extended beta-sheet overlaid by two, slightly curved alpha-helices. mutagenesis experiments demonstrate that two functions of ftsq, localization and recruitment, occur in two separate domains. proteins that localize ftsq need the second beta-strand of  the potra domain and those that are recruited by ftsq, like ftsl/ftsb, require the surface formed by the tip of the last alpha-helix and the two c-terminal beta-strands. both domains act together to accomplish the role of ftsq in linking upstream and downstream cell division proteins within the divisome.

TI  == pleiotropic phenotypes of a yersinia enterocolitica flhd mutant include reduced lethality in a chicken embryo model.
AB  == background: the yersinia enterocolitica flagellar master regulator flhd/flhc affects the expression levels of non-flagellar genes, including 21 genes that are involved in central metabolism. the sigma factor of the flagellar system, flia, has a negative effect on the expression levels of seven plasmid-encoded virulence genes in addition to its positive effect on the expression levels of eight of the flagellar operons. this study investigates the phenotypes of flhd and flia mutants that result from the complex gene regulation. results: phenotypes relating to central metabolism were investigated with phenotype microarrays. compared to the wild-type strain, isogenic flhd and flia mutants exhibited increased growth on purines and reduced growth on n-acetyl-d-glucosamine and d-mannose, when used as a sole carbon source. both mutants grew more poorly on pyrimidines and l-histidine as sole nitrogen source. several intermediates of the tricarboxylic acid and the urea cycle, as well as several dipeptides, provided differential growth conditions for the two mutants. gene expression was determined for selected genes and correlated with the observed phenotypes. phenotypes relating to virulence were determined with the chicken embryo lethality assay. the assay that was previously established for escherichia coli strains was modified for y. enterocolitica. the flhd mutant caused reduced chicken embryo lethality when compared to wild-type bacteria. in contrast, the flia mutant caused wild-type lethality. this indicates that the virulence phenotype of the flhd mutant might be due to genes that are regulated by flhd/flhc but not flia, such as those that encode the flagellar type iii secretion system. conclusion: phenotypes of flhd and flia mutants are related to  central metabolism and virulence and correlate with gene regulation.

TI  == outbreak of acute gastroenteritis of unknown etiology caused by contaminated drinking water in a rural village in austria, august 2006.
AB  == background: in august 2006 a physician from a rural village reported an outbreak  of acute gastroenteritis. an investigation was undertaken in order to determine the magnitude of the outbreak, the source of infection and to prevent further disease. this is the first published outbreak of acute gastroenteritis caused by  contaminated drinking water in austria. methods: for descriptive epidemiology, the investigators had to rely on voluntary cooperation from physicians and patients, data collected by a police officer and data on sick leave reported by physicians to the health insurance system. results: microbiological testing of water samples indicated that this cluster was caused by fecal contamination of untreated drinking water. age and sex distributions were available for 146 of 160 cases: ages ranged from 5 to 91 years (median 45) and 81 cases (55.5%) were female. stool samples from 14 patients were sent for microbiological analysis: all tested negative for salmonella, campylobacter, shigella and yersinia enterocolitica. specimens were not tested for viruses, parasites or enteropathogenic escherichia coli. discussion: in this outbreak no identification was made of pathogenic microorganisms in stool samples from affected patients, despite the occurrence of fecal indicator organisms in samples of drinking water. in outbreaks of gastroenteritis, medical practitioners should encourage microbiological testing beyond the limited routine program. public health officers must be made aware that the spectrum of routine laboratory tests on stool specimens does not cover the wide array of pathogens capable of causing waterborne outbreaks. the springs serving the affected village originate in a mountainous area of karst formations, and heavy falls of rain that occurred at the beginning of the outbreak may explain introduction of fecal bacteria. in view of the unsolved problem of possible future contamination of springs in karst areas, the water department of this district authority has issued an order requesting installation of a permanent ultraviolet water-treatment facility.

TI  == ammonia disinfection of animal feeds --laboratory study.
AB  == animal feeds may be contaminated, accidentally or maliciously, with a number of zoonotic bacteria. animal infections with these bacterial agents, whether or not  they cause animal disease, may lead to human illnesses. anhydrous ammonia was introduced on farms in developed countries as a high-nitrogen soil amendment, but later found use in enhancing crude protein in low-quality roughage fed to ruminants and in neutralizing mycotoxins in fungus-infested feed grains. although ammonia has been known to be effective against bacteria in other contexts (e.g.,  manure, community sewage sludge, seeds for sprouting, and boneless lean beef trimmings), it appears that the antibacterial effect of ammoniating animal feeds  had not been tested. in the present study, samples of roughage (wheat straw, corn silage) and concentrates (corn grain, cottonseed) produced as animal feed were contaminated with dried-on zoonotic bacteria (salmonella newport in all; campylobacte jejuni, e. coli o157:h7, listeria monocytogenes, yersinia enterocolitica in corn grain only). disinfection with anhydrous ammonia gas was conducted for 24 h at room temperature ( 25 degrees c). the treatment was least effective in silage because the silage alone showed strong antibacterial activity, which may have been slightly reduced by ammoniation. in the other three feeds, depending on the initial level of contamination, ammonia destruction of >or= 5 log10 cfu/g (99.999%) of the selected contaminant was usually observed.

AB  == strain nrrl b-30745, isolated from chicken ceca and identified as enterococcus durans, enterococcus faecium, or enterococcus hirae, was initially identified as  antagonistic to campylobacter jejuni. the isolate produced a 5,362-da bacteriocin (enterocin) that inhibits the growth of salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis,  s. enterica serovar choleraesuis, s. enterica serovar typhimurium, s. enterica serovar gallinarum, escherichia coli o157:h7, yersinia enterocolitica, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae, shigella dysenteriae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, listeria monocytogenes, campylobacter jejuni, and 20  other campylobacter species isolates. the enterocin, e-760, was isolated and purified by cation-exchange and hydrophobic-interaction chromatographies. the proteinaceous nature of purified enterocin e-760 was demonstrated upon treatment  with various proteolytic enzymes. specifically, the antimicrobial peptide was found to be sensitive to beta-chymotrypsin, proteinase k, and papain, while it was resistant to lysozyme and lipase. the enterocin demonstrated thermostability  by retaining activity after 5 min at 100 degrees c and was stable at ph values between 5.0 and 8.7. however, activity was lost below ph 3.0 and above ph 9.5. administration of enterocin e-760-treated feed significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the colonization of young broiler chicks experimentally challenged and colonized  with two strains of c. jejuni by more than 8 log(10) cfu. enterocin e-760 also significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the colonization of naturally acquired campylobacter species in market age broiler chickens when administered in treated feed 4 days prior to analysis.

TI  == the high-precision solution structure of yersinia modulating protein ymoa provides insight into interaction with h-ns.
AB  == the high-resolution solution structure of yersinia modulating protein ymoa is presented. the protein is all helical with the first three of four helices forming the central core. structures calculated with only noe and dihedral restraints exhibit a backbone root-mean-square deviation (rmsd) of 0.77 a. upon refinement against halpha-calpha, hn-n, and calpha-c' j-modulated residual dipolar couplings, the backbone rmsd improves to 0.22 a. ymoa has a high amino acid sequence identity to and a similar overall fold to escherichia coli hemolysin expression modulating protein hha; however, structural differences do occur. ymoa is also found to be structurally similar to the histone-like nucleoid structuring protein h-ns, indicating that ymoa may intercalate into higher-order  h-ns suprastructuring by substituting for an h-ns dimer.

TI  == inhibition of foodborne pathogens by native microflora recovered from fresh peeled baby carrot and propagated in cultures.
AB  == the inhibitory effect of fresh peeled baby carrot and associated microflora on the viability and growth of listeria monocytogenes, yersinia enterocolitica, salmonella enterica, escherichia coli o157:h7, and pseudomonas marginalis was investigated. the population of viable l. monocytogenes was reduced by more than  2 logs following the dipping of sliced baby carrots in the bacterial suspension for 2 min. however, other pathogens subjected to the same treatment showed no reduction in the population. surface sanitization of baby carrots reduced the number of native microflora and in turn increased the growth of each pathogen on  this commodity by 2 to 3 logs. filter-sterilized carrot homogenates exhibited no  antimicrobial activity and were capable of supporting the growth of each pathogen to a density of over 2 x 10(9) cfu/ml. however, the growth of each pathogen in carrot homogenates containing microflora recovered from baby carrot and propagated in tryptic soy broth was reduced 2 to 3 logs after incubation at 28 degrees c for 2 d. on pepper disks, which have no antilisterial activity and very low levels of background microflora, the addition of carrot microflora also reduced the growth of each pathogen 2 to 4 logs after 2 d at 20 degrees c. the reduction was dependent upon the ratio between the number of carrot microflora and pathogen tested. the growth of l. monocytogenes or y. enterocolitica on pepper disks containing carrot microflora was almost completely stopped after storage at 8 degrees c for 8 d. the inhibitory effect of baby carrots on pathogens is in part due to the antimicrobial activity of carrot tissue and in part due to the antagonistic action of associated microflora.

TI  == contamination of milk by enterococci and coliforms from bovine faeces.
AB  == aim: to determine the contribution of enterococci and coliforms from bovine faeces and teats to contamination of raw milk. methods: putative enterococci (n = 301) and coliforms (n = 365) were isolated from bovine faeces (n = 20), cows' teats (n = 20), the raw milk (n = 1) and the milking environment (n = 4) on one farm. the clonal relationships of each bacterial group were investigated using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of genomic macrorestriction fragments. representatives of the different clusters of enterococci were identified by molecular techniques including rep-pcr, sds protein profiling, fluorescent amplified fragment length polymorphism (faflp), phenylalanyl-trna synthase (phes) sequence analysis and/or 16s rdna gene sequencing. coliforms were identified by api 20e strips. results: the majority of the bovine faecal enterococcal isolates  were identified as a potential new species of aerococcus (100 isolates); e. faecium (28 isolates), and aerococcus viridans (28 isolates) were also found. all coliform isolates from the bovine faeces were identified as escherichia coli. the coliforms present in the milk were hafnia alvei, serratia liquefaciens, yersinia  enterocolitica and enterobacter amnigenus. no e. coli, enterococcus or aerococcus from the bovine faeces were found in the milk. a single clone of h. alvei was found in the water, the milking equipment and the milk, suggesting that the water was the source of the organism in the milk. no vancomycin-resistant aerococci or  enterococci were found while most of the isolates tested showed the presence of at least one virulence gene. the milk-sock retained strains that adhered to particulate faecal material. coliforms were present at approx. 2 orders of magnitude greater than enterococci in the bovine faeces. conclusions: the results imply that bovine faeces are not an important source of contamination of raw milk with enterococci or coliforms. significance and impact of the study: the results  confirm those of two previous studies (gelsomino et al. 2001, int j food microbiol71, 177-188 and kagkli et al. 2007, int j food microbiol114, 243-251) on two other farms. the three studies show that contamination of milk by enterococci, lactobacilli and coliforms of bovine faecal origin is extremely low. the results also suggest that where raw milk is implicated in food infection, other factors in addition to faecal contamination must be involved.

AB  == a series of metal complexes were synthesized from equimolar amounts of schiff bases: 1,4-bis[3-(2-hydroxy-1-naphthaldimine)propyl]piperazine (bappnaf) and 1,8-bis[3-(2-hydroxy-1-naphthaldimine)-p-menthane (damnaf) with metal chlorides.  all of synthesized compounds were characterized by elemental analyses, spectral (uv-vis, ir, (1)h-(13)c nmr, lc-ms) and thermal (tga-dta) methods, magnetic and conductance measurements. schiff base complexes supposed in tetragonal geometry have the general formula [m(bappnaf or damnaf)]cl.nh(2)o, where m=cr(iii), co(iii) and n=2, 3. but also fe(iii) complexes have octahedral geometry by the coordination of two water molecules and the formula is [fe(bappnaf or damnaf)(h(2)o)(2)]cl. the changes in the selected vibration bands in ft-ir indicate that schiff bases behave as (onno) tetradentate ligands and coordinate to metal ions from two phenolic oxygen atoms and two azomethine nitrogen atoms. conductance measurements suggest 1:1 electrolytic nature of the metal complexes.  the synthesized compounds except bappnaf ligand have the antimicrobial activity against the bacteria: escherichia coli (atcc 11230), yersinia enterocolitica (atcc 1501), bacillus magaterium (rskk 5117), bacillus subtilis (rskk 244), bacillus cereus (rskk 863) and the fungi: candida albicans (atcc 10239). these results have been considerably interest in piperazine derivatives due to their significant applications in antimicrobial studies.

AB  == the objective of this study was to determine whether the temperate yersinia enterocolitica phage py54 may interact with the related escherichia coli phage n15 during both the lysogenic and the lytic cycle in the same cell. the py54 and  n15 prophages are linear plasmids which have been shown to be compatible and stably replicating in e. coli and yersinia. in e. coli, the py54 prophage does not restrict n15 propagation. in contrast, n15 reduces by use of its cor gene the susceptibility of yersinia strains to py54. doubly lysogenic e. coli strains release py54 virions, some of which apparently contain the n15 genome. further experiments with replicative miniplasmid derivatives of py54, n15, and the related klebsiella oxytoca phage phiko2 demonstrated that the phiko2 and n15 plasmid prophages belong to the same incompatibility group.

TI  == bacteria induce ctgf and cyr61 expression in epithelial cells in a lysophosphatidic acid receptor-dependent manner.
AB  == cysteine-rich protein 61 (cyr61/ccn1) and connective tissue growth factor (ctgf/ccn2) are members of the ccn (cyr61, ctgf, nephroblastoma overexpressed gene) family and exert pleiotropic functions such as regulation of adhesion, migration, extracellular matrix deposition, or cell differentiation, and play an  important role in wound healing. this study focused on the nature of the so far unknown ctgf and cyr61 mrna expression of epithelial cells after infection with bacteria. we demonstrate that infection of epithelial cells with attenuated yersinia enterocolitica lacking the virulence plasmid pyv leads to the expression of cyr61 and ctgf. virulent y. enterocolitica bearing the pyv virulence plasmid suppressed the mrna expression of these genes. yersinia-mediated inhibition of ctgf and cyr61 mrna expression is partially mediated by the cysteine protease yopt. further characterization of the yersinia factors, which trigger ctgf and cyr61 mrna expression, demonstrated that these factors were secreted and could be enriched in lipid extracts. beside yersinia, several other bacteria such as escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, or staphylococcus aureus, as well as supernatants of these bacteria induced ctgf and cyr61 expression. blocking experiments with the lysophosphatidic acid (lpa) receptor-specific inhibitor ki16425 suggest a general involvement of lpa receptors in bacteria-triggered ctgf and cyr61 expression. these data suggest that lpa receptor-dependent expression of ctgf and cyr61 represents a common host response after interaction with bacteria.

TI  == recombining population structure of plesiomonas shigelloides (enterobacteriaceae) revealed by multilocus sequence typing.
AB  == plesiomonas shigelloides is an emerging pathogen that is widespread in the aquatic environment and is responsible for intestinal diseases and extraintestinal infections in humans and other animals. virtually nothing is known about its genetic diversity, population structure, and evolution, which severely limits epidemiological control. we addressed these questions by developing a multilocus sequence typing (mlst) system based on five genes (fusa,  leus, pyrg, recg, and rpob) and analyzing 77 epidemiologically unrelated strains  from several countries and several ecological sources. the phylogenetic position  of p. shigelloides within family enterobacteriaceae was precisely defined by phylogenetic analysis of the same gene portions in other family members. within p. shigelloides, high levels of nucleotide diversity (average percentage of nucleotide differences between strains, 1.49%) and genotypic diversity (64 distinct sequence types; simpson's index, 99.7%) were found, with no salient internal phylogenetic structure. we estimated that homologous recombination in housekeeping genes affects p. shigelloides alleles and nucleotides 7 and 77 times more frequently than mutation, respectively. these ratios are similar to those observed in the naturally transformable species streptococcus pneumoniae with a high rate of recombination. in contrast, recombination within salmonella enterica, escherichia coli, and yersinia enterocolitica was much less frequent. p. shigelloides thus stands out among members of the enterobacteriaceae. its high rate of recombination results in a lack of association between genomic background and o and h antigenic factors, as observed for the 51 serotypes found in our sample. given its robustness and discriminatory power, we recommend mlst as a reference method for population biology studies and epidemiological tracking of p. shigelloides strains.

TI  == [prevalence of the bacteria causing diarrea in a rosario hospital, argentina].
AB  == bacterial agents causing diarrea in patients attended in a hospital of rosario, argentina. the frequency of bacterial agents causing diarrhea can vary in patients of different areas, and through the time. in an epidemiological surveillance we studied 304 patients with diarrheal diseases looking for salmonella enterica, shigella spp, campylobacter spp, aeromonas spp, yersinia enterocolitica, and diarrheogenic escherichia coli. c. jejuni was isolated in 30  patients (9,9 %), salmonella in 18 (5,9 %), and enteropathogenic e. coli (epec) in 7 (2,3 %). most cases due ton c. jejuni had mucus and/or blood in their feces. unexpectedly we didn't fine any cases due to shigella spp. there was much less cases due to epec than in our previous studies, and occurred only in children of  less than 5 years old. it is necesary to take in consideration that c. jejuni cause nearly all the cases of diarrhea in patients with mucus and blood in their  feces actually in our region.

TI  == nucleoside analogues are activated by bacterial deoxyribonucleoside kinases in a  species-specific manner.
AB  == objectives: to investigate the bactericidal activity of antiviral and anticancer  nucleoside analogues against a variety of pathogenic bacteria and characterize the activating enzymes, deoxyribonucleoside kinases (dnks). methods: several fda-approved nucleoside analogue drugs were screened for their potential bactericidal activity against several clinical bacterial isolates and type strains. we identified and subcloned the genes coding for putative deoxyribonucleoside kinases in escherichia coli, pasteurella multocida, salmonella enterica, yersinia enterocolitica, bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens and listeria monocytogenes. these genes were tested for their ability to increase the susceptibility of a dnk-deficient e. coli strain to various analogues. we overexpressed, purified and characterized the substrate specificity and kinetic properties of the recombinant enzymes from s. enterica and b. cereus. results: the tested gram-negative bacteria were susceptible to 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (azt) in the concentration range 0.032-31.6 microm except for a single e. coli isolate and two pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates which were resistant to the tested azt concentrations. purified recombinant s. enterica thymidine kinase phosphorylated azt efficiently with a km of 73.3 microm and k(cat)/km of 6.6 x 10(4) s(-1) m(-1) and is the activator of this drug in vivo. 2',2'-difluoro-2'-deoxycytidine (gemcitabine) was a potent antibiotic against gram-positive bacteria in the concentration range between 0.001 and 1.0 microm. the b. cereus deoxyadenosine kinase had a km for gemcitabine of 33.5 microm and k(cat)/km of 5.1 x 10(3) s(-1) m(-1) and activates gemcitabine in vivo. s. enterica and b. cereus are now amongst the first bacteria with a completely characterized set of dnk enzymes. conclusions: bacterial dnks efficiently activate nucleoside analogues in a species-specific manner. therefore, nucleoside analogues have a potential to be employed as antibiotics in the fight against emerging multiresistant bacteria.

AB  == sheep were immunized with killed salmonella enterica serotype urbana cells and their sera were tested in various serological tests for antibody to brucella sp., yersinia enterocolitica o:9 and escherichia coli o:157 h:7. of the eight sheep, all gave a positive agglutination reaction in the brucellosis buffered antigen plate agglutination test (bpat), seven gave positive brucellosis standard tube agglutination test (tat) and complement fixation test (cft) results and four gave slightly positive reactions in a competitive enzyme immunoassay (celisa). seven sera were negative in an indirect enzyme immunoassay (ielisa-slps) using b. abortus smooth lipopolysaccharide (slps) antigen and all were negative in a fluorescence polarization assay (fpa-ops) using b. abortus o-polysaccharide antigen. two sheep gave a slight positive reaction in an ielisa using brucella rough lipopolysaccharide antigen (ielisa-rlps) and four sheep were slightly positive in an fpa using brucella lps core antigen (fpa-core). all sheep had high antibody responses to s. enterica serotype urbana, y. and e. coli o:157 and 7 were positive for antibody to y. enterocolitica o:9 when tested by ielisa. the sheep were negative when tested in the fpa using ops from y. enterocolitica o:9 but all were strongly positive in the fpa using ops from e. coli o:157 while seven sheep had titers to s. enterica serotype urbana. the impact on diagnostic serology for brucellosis is discussed.

TI  == regions important for the adhesin activity of moraxella catarrhalis hag.
AB  == background: the moraxella catarrhalis hag protein, an oca autotransporter adhesin, has previously been shown to be important for adherence of this respiratory tract pathogen to human middle ear and a549 lung cells. results: the  present study demonstrates that adherence of m. catarrhalis isogenic hag mutant strains to the human epithelial cell lines chang (conjunctival) and ncih292 (lung) is reduced by 50-93%. furthermore, expressing hag in a heterologous escherichia coli background substantially increased the adherence of recombinant  bacteria to ncih292 cells and murine type iv collagen. hag did not, however, increase the attachment of e. coli to chang cells. these results indicate that hag directly mediates adherence to ncih292 lung cells and collagen, but is not sufficient to confer binding to conjunctival monolayers. several in-frame deletions were engineered within the hag gene of m. catarrhalis strain o35e and the resulting proteins were tested for their ability to mediate binding to ncih292 monolayers, middle ear cells, and type iv collagen. these experiments revealed that epithelial cell and collagen binding properties are separable, and  that residues 385-705 of this ~2,000 amino acid protein are important for adherence to middle ear and ncih292 cells. the region of o35e-hag encompassing aa 706 to 1194 was also found to be required for adherence to collagen. in contrast, beta-roll repeats present in hag, which are structural features conserved in several oca adhesins and responsible for the adhesive properties of yersinia enterocolitica yada, are not important for hag-mediated adherence. conclusion: hag is a major adherence factor for human cells derived from various anatomical sites relevant to pathogenesis by m. catarrhalis and its structure-function relationships differ from those of other, closely-related autotransporter proteins.

TI  == global analysis of tolerance to secretin-induced stress in yersinia enterocolitica suggests that the phage-shock-protein system may be a remarkably self-contained stress response.
AB  == the phage-shock-protein (psp) system is essential for yersinia enterocolitica virulence. mislocalized secretins induce psp gene expression, and kill psp null strains. we used transposon mutagenesis to investigate whether other genes are required to tolerate secretin-induced stress. our motivation included the possibility of identifying signal transducers required to activate psp gene expression. besides psp, only defects in the rpoe system and the trka potassium transporter caused secretin sensitivity. these mutations did not cause the same specific/severe sensitivity as defects in the psp system, nor did they affect psp gene expression. the escherichia coli psp system was reported to be induced via the arcb redox sensor and to activate anaerobic metabolism. our screen did not identify arcb, or any genes involved in anaerobic metabolism/regulation. therefore, we investigated the role of arcb in y. enterocolitica and e. coli. arcb was not required for secretin-dependent induction of psp gene expression. furthermore, microarray analysis uncovered a restricted transcriptional response  to prolonged secretin stress in y. enterocolitica. taken together, these data do  not support the proposal that the psp system is induced via arcb and activates anaerobic metabolism. rather, they suggest that psp proteins may sense an inducing trigger and mediate their physiological output(s) directly.

TI  == reversible differentiation of caco-2 cells reveals galectin-9 as a surface marker molecule for human follicle-associated epithelia and m cell-like cells.
AB  == m cells interspersed in the follicle-associated epithelium of peyer's patches represent the major antigen sampling cells of the intestinal mucosa providing immune surveillance for particulate antigens. despite their crucial role in immune defense our knowledge about these elusive cells is still only rudimentary. a caco-2 co-culture model for the induction of m cell-like cells and dna microarray analysis for differential gene expression profiling were employed to identify (a) putative suitable surface marker(s). induction of m cell-like cells  was demonstrated morphologically by electron microscopy, evaluated by infection with yersinia enterocolitica and enteropathogenic escherichia coli strain e2348/69 and further monitored by changes in binding of the lectin uea-1. the differentiation of caco-2 cells was found to be reversible, dependent on (a) lymphocyte-derived soluble factor(s) and accompanied by the up-regulation of the  glycoprotein lectin galectin-9, which was specifically expressed on these cells as well as on human follicle-associated epithelial (fae) cells. galectin-9 represents a novel surface marker which might be employed for molecular targeting to the peyer's patches thereby opening new opportunities for drug and vaccine development.

TI  == comparative analysis of the regulation of rova from the pathogenic yersiniae.
AB  == rova is a marr/slya-type regulator that mediates the transcription of inv in yersinia enterocolitica and y. pseudotuberculosis. in y. pseudotuberculosis, rova transcription is controlled primarily by h-ns and rova, which bind to similar regions within the rova promoter. at 37 degrees c, rova transcription is repressed by h-ns. transcription of rova results when rova relieves h-ns-mediated repression. the region of the rova promoter that h-ns and rova bind is not conserved in the y. enterocolitica promoter. using green fluorescent protein reporters, we determined that the y. enterocolitica rova (rova(yent)) promoter is weaker than the y. pseudotuberculosis promoter. however, despite the missing h-ns/rova binding site in the rova(yent) promoter, h-ns and rova are still involved in the regulation of rova(yent). dna binding studies suggest that h-ns and rova bind with a higher affinity to the y. pseudotuberculosis/y. pestis rova  (rova(ypstb/ypestis)) promoter than to the rova(yent) promoter. furthermore, h-ns appears to bind to two regions in a cooperative fashion within the rova(yent) promoter that is not observed with the rova(ypstb/ypestis) promoter. finally, using a transposon mutagenesis approach, we identified a new positive regulator of rova in y. enterocolitica, leuo. in escherichia coli, leuo regulates gene expression via changes in levels of rpos and h-ns, but leuo-mediated regulation of rova(yent) appears to be independent of either of these two proteins. together, these data demonstrate that while the rova regulatory factors are conserved in yersinia, divergence of y. enterocolitica and y. pseudotuberculosis/y. pestis during evolution has resulted in modifications in the mechanisms that are responsible for controlling rova transcription.

TI  == a rapid multiplexed chemiluminescent immunoassay for the detection of escherichia coli o157:h7, yersinia enterocolitica, salmonella typhimurium, and listeria monocytogenes pathogen bacteria.
AB  == a simple and rapid multiplexed sandwich chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay has been developed for the simultaneous detection of escherichia coli o157:h7, yersinia enterocolitica, salmonella typhimurium, and listeria monocytogenes. to achieve the multiplexed detection of the four pathogens, a new polystyrene 96 well microtiter plate format has been designed, in which each main well contains  four subwells in the bottom. the monoclonal antibodies specific for each bacteria were separately immobilized in each subwell. when the samples were added to the main wells, the bacteria able to specifically bind to the corresponding monoclonal antibody were captured in one of the four subwells. subsequently, a mixture of peroxidase-labeled polyclonal antibodies against the four bacteria was added and the peroxidase activity of the bound polyclonal labeled antibodies in each well was measured by an enhanced luminol-based chemiluminescent cocktail using a low-light charge-coupled imaging device. the assay was simple and fast, and the limit of quantification was in the order of 104-105 cfu/ml for all bacterial species. the accuracy of the method, evaluated by comparison of the results with a conventional culturing methodology, was satisfactory, with recovery values ranging from 90 to 120%. this method can be used as a screening test to evaluate the presence of these pathogen bacteria in different foodstuffs.

TI  == vapor-phase activities of cinnamon, thyme, and oregano essential oils and key constituents against foodborne microorganisms.
AB  == the aim of the study presented here was to gain knowledge about the vapor-phase antimicrobial activity of selected essential oils and their major putatively active constituents against a range of foodborne bacterial and fungal strains. in a first step, the vapor-phase antimicrobial activities of three commercially available essential oils (eos)-cinnamon (cinnamomum zeylanicum), thyme (thymus vulgaris), and oregano (origanum vulgare)-were evaluated against a wide range of  microorganisms, including gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, yersinia enterocolitica, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and salmonella choleraesuis), gram-positive bacteria (listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, and enterococcus faecalis), molds (penicillium islandicum and aspergillus flavus), and a yeast (candida albicans). the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were generally lower for oregano eo than for the thyme and cinnamon eos, especially against the relatively resistant gram-negative. the persistence of the eos' antimicrobial activities over time was assessed, and changes in the composition of the atmosphere they generated over time were determined using single-drop microextraction (sdme) in combination with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (gc-ms) and subsequent analysis of the data by principal component analysis (pca). more relevant chemicals were selected. in addition, the vapor-phase activities of putatively key constituents of the oils were screened against representative gram-positive (l. monocytogenes) and gram-negative (s. choleraesuis) bacteria, a mold (a. flavus), and a yeast (c. albicans). of the tested compounds, cinnamaldehyde, thymol, and carvacrol showed the strongest antimicrobial effectiveness, so their mics, defined as the minimum vapor concentrations that completely inhibited detectable growth of the microorganisms, were calculated. to check for possible interactions between components present in the eos, cinnamon eo was fortified with cinnamaldehyde and thyme eo with thymol,  and then the antimicrobial activities of the fortified oils were compared to those of the respective unfortified eos using fractional inhibitory concentration (fic) indices and by plotting inhibition curves as functions of the vapor-phase concentrations. synergistic effects were detected for cinnamaldehyde on a. flavus and for thymol on l. monocytogenes, s. choleraesuis, and a. flavus. in all other  cases the fortification had additive effects, except for cinnamaldehyde's activity against s. choleraesuis, for which the effect was antagonistic. finally, various microorganisms were found to cause slight changes over time to the atmospheres generated by all of the eos (fortified and unfortified) except the fortified cinnamon eo.

TI  == identification of commensal bacterial strains that modulate yersinia enterocolitica and dextran sodium sulfate-induced inflammatory responses: implications for the development of probiotics.
AB  == an increasing body of evidence suggests that probiotic bacteria are effective in  the treatment of enteric infections, although the molecular basis of this activity remains elusive. to identify putative probiotics, we tested commensal bacteria in terms of their toxicity, invasiveness, inhibition of yersinia-induced inflammation in vitro and in vivo, and modulation of dextran sodium sulfate (dss)-induced colitis in mice. the commensal bacteria escherichia coli, bifidobacterium adolescentis, bacteroides vulgatus, bacteroides distasonis, and streptococcus salivarius were screened for adhesion to, invasion of, and toxicity for host epithelial cells (ec), and the strains were tested for their ability to  inhibit y. enterocolitica-induced nf-kappab activation. additionally, b. adolescentis was administered to mice orally infected with y. enterocolitica and  to mice with mucosae impaired by dss treatment. none of the commensal bacteria tested was toxic for or invaded the ec. b. adolescentis, b. distasonis, b. vulgatus, and s. salivarius inhibited the y. enterocolitica-induced nf-kappab activation and interleukin-8 production in ec. in line with these findings, b. adolescentis-fed mice had significantly lower results for mean pathogen burden in the visceral organs, intestinal tumor necrosis factor alpha mrna expression, and  loss of body weight upon oral infection with y. enterocolitica. in addition, the  administration of b. adolescentis decelerated inflammation upon dss treatment in  mice. we suggest that our approach might help to identify new probiotics to be used for the treatment of inflammatory and infectious gastrointestinal disorders.

TI  == preferential recognition of a microbial metabolite by human vgamma2vdelta2 t cells.
AB  == human vgamma2vdelta2 t cells are stimulated by prenyl pyrophosphates, such as isopentenyl pyrophosphate (ipp), and play important roles in mediating immunity against microbial pathogens and have potent anti-tumor activity. (e)-4-hydroxy-3-methyl-but-2-enyl pyrophosphate (hmbpp) has been identified as a  metabolite in the 2-c-methyl-d-erythritol-4 phosphate (mep) pathway for isoprenoid biosynthesis that is used by many bacteria and protozoan parasites. we find that hmbpp is the major vgamma2vdelta2 t-cell antigen for many bacteria, including mycobacterium tuberculosis, yersinia enterocolitica and escherichia coli. hmbpp was a 30 000-fold more potent antigen than ipp. using mutant bacteria, we show that bacterial antigen levels for vgamma2vdelta2 t cells are controlled by mep pathway enzymes and find no evidence for the production of 3-formyl-1-butyl pyrophosphate. moreover, hmbpp reactivity required only germ line-encoded vgamma2vdelta2 tcr elements and is present at birth. importantly, we show that bacterial hmbpp levels correlated with their ability to expand vgamma2vdelta2 t cells in vivo upon engraftment into severe combined immunodeficiency-beige mice. thus, the production of hmbpp by a microbial-specific isoprenoid pathway plays a major role in determining whether bacteria will stimulate vgamma2vdelta2 t cells in vivo. this preferential stimulation by a common microbial isoprenoid metabolite allows vgamma2vdelta2 t cells to respond to a broad array of pathogens using this pathway.

AB  == this study was conducted to determine the efficacy of a one atmosphere uniform glow discharge plasma (oaugdp) for inactivation of foodborne pathogens and to evaluate the influence of growth temperature, ph, and culture age on their inactivation. escherichia coli o157:h7, listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, salmonella enteritidis, vibrio parahaemolyticus, yersinia enterocolitica, and shigella flexneri were evaluated. three-strain mixtures of each bacterium were inoculated (6-7 log cfu/cm(2)) onto microscope slides containing nonselective agar media adjusted to ph 5 or 7. samples were exposed to plasma for 0-240 sec immediately, or after incubation for 24 h at 10 degrees c or 35 degrees c. after exposure, the agar was removed from the slides and pummeled in 0.1% peptone water with a stomacher, serially diluted, surface plated onto nonselective media, and incubated at 35 degrees c. exposure time, ph, incubation temperature, and culture age affected survival of all pathogens exposed to plasma (p < 0.05). the greatest reduction of pathogens generally occurred during the initial exposure time of 30 or 90 sec. pathogens incubated for 24 h before exposure were more resistant than those exposed immediately after inoculation. incubation at 35 degrees c before exposure resulted in greater resistance to plasma inactivation than incubation at 10 degrees c. no appreciable differences between gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens were observed, although the spore-forming b. cereus was more resistant to plasma than non-spore-formers. these findings support the potential for plasma treatment of foods or surfaces for pathogen reduction. increased sensitivity of pathogens to plasma at reduced ph and temperature is encouraging, since these conditions are applicable to many foods during processing, handling, and storage.

AB  == we report here the crystal structure at 2.0 a resolution of the agr_c_4470p protein from the gram-negative bacterium agrobacterium tumefaciens. the protein is a tightly associated dimer, each subunit of which bears strong structural homology with the two domains of the heme utilization protein chus from escherichia coli and hems from yersinia enterocolitica. remarkably, the organization of the agr_c_4470p dimer is the same as that of the two domains in chus and hems, providing structural evidence that these two proteins evolved by gene duplication. however, the binding site for heme, while conserved in hems and chus, is not conserved in agr_c_4470p, suggesting that it probably has a different function. this is supported by the presence of two homologs of agr_c_4470p in e. coli, in addition to the chus protein.

TI  == blockade of catecholamine-induced growth by adrenergic and dopaminergic receptor  antagonists in escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella enterica and yersinia enterocolitica.
AB  == background: the ability of catecholamines to stimulate bacterial growth was first demonstrated just over a decade ago. little is still known however, concerning the nature of the putative bacterial adrenergic and/or dopaminergic receptor(s) to which catecholamines (norepinephrine, epinephrine and dopamine) may bind and exert their effects, or even whether the binding properties of such a receptor are similar between different species. results: use of specific catecholamine receptor antagonists revealed that only alpha, and not beta, adrenergic antagonists were capable of blocking norepinephrine and epinephrine-induced growth, while antagonism of dopamine-mediated growth was achieved with the use of a dopaminergic antagonist. both adrenergic and dopaminergic antagonists were highly specific in their mechanism of action, which did not involve blockade of catecholamine-facilitated iron-acquisition. use of radiolabeled norepinephrine suggested that the adrenergic antagonists could be acting by inhibiting catecholamine uptake. conclusion: the present data demonstrates that the ability  of a specific pathogen to respond to a particular hormone is dependent upon the host anatomical region in which the pathogen causes disease as well as the neuroanatomical specificity to which production of the particular hormone is restricted; and that both are anatomically coincidental to each other. as such, the present report suggests that pathogens with a high degree of exclusivity to the gastrointestinal tract have evolved response systems to neuroendocrine hormones such as norepinephrine and dopamine, but not epinephrine, which are found with the enteric nervous system.

AB  == the genotypic and phenotypic variability of 40 lactococcus lactis isolates obtained from three cheese-making trials of batzos cheese made one in each, winter, spring and summer was investigated. rapd-pcr, plasmid profiling and pfge  were used to study the genetic variability and distinguish closely related isolates. results showed a high degree of heterogeneity among strains. according  to pfge data, all strains except one were clustered together (at a similarity level of approximately 50%) with the l. lactis subsp. lactis reference strain and eleven groups of isolates consisting of 2-8 strains each were distinguished. plasmid profiling results revealed that there were eight isolates lacking plasmids and nine having unique plasmids. twenty-three isolates were allocated into six groups. there was an interesting similarity between the plasmid profiling groups and those formed according to pfge. clustering of strains according to rapd-pcr was in agreement with results obtained by both plasmid profiling and pfge for the majority of the strains. in addition, results obtained by molecular methods indicate a grouping of most of the strains according to the  season of cheese production. all strains inhibited the growth of escherichia coli o157:h7. their ability to affect the growth of yersinia enterocolitica, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, listeria monocytogenes and enterococcus faecalis was strain dependent. in 42.5% of the isolates high acidifying ability in milk after 24 h was recorded and these were isolates, mainly, from fresh cheese. the 75% of the isolates from winter cheese exhibited higher lys- than leu-aminopeptidase activity while the approximately 67% of the isolates from summer cheese showed higher leu- than lys-aminopeptidase activity. their caseinolytic activity after growth in milk for 24 h was significant with preference for alpha(s)-casein degradation. the majority (90%) of the strains formed methanethiol from methionine and this ability was strain dependent. these  results suggest that among the wild lactococcal population from batzos cheese there are interesting strains appropriate to be used as starters for the dairy industry.

TI  == the xaxab genes encoding a new apoptotic toxin from the insect pathogen xenorhabdus nematophila are present in plant and human pathogens.
AB  == xenorhabdus nematophila, a member of the enterobacteriaceae, kills many species of insects by strongly depressing the immune system and colonizing the entire body. a peptide cytotoxin has been purified from x. nematophila broth growth, and the cytolytic effect on insect immunocytes and hemolytic effect on mammalian red  blood cells of this toxin have been described (ribeiro, c., vignes, m., and brehelin, m. (2003) j. biol. chem. 278, 3030-3039). we show here that this toxin, xenorhabdus alpha-xenorhabdolysin (xax), triggers apoptosis in both insect and mammalian cells. we also report the cloning and sequencing of two genes, xaxab, encoding this toxin in x. nematophila. the expression of both genes in recombinant escherichia coli led to the production of active cytotoxin/hemolysin. however, hemolytic activity was observed only if the two peptides were added in the appropriate order. furthermore, we report here that inactivation of xaxab genes in x. nematophila abolished the major cytotoxic activity present in broth growth, called c1. we also show that these genes are present in various entomopathogenic bacteria of the genera xenorhabdus and photorhabdus, in pseudomonas entomophila, in the human pathogens yersinia enterocolitica and proteus mirabilis, and in the plant pathogen pseudomonas syringae. this toxin cannot be classified in any known family of cytotoxins on the basis of amino acid sequences, locus organization, and activity features. it is, therefore, probably  the prototype of a new family of binary toxins.

TI  == specificity of catecholamine-induced growth in escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella enterica and yersinia enterocolitica.
AB  == the present study demonstrates that catecholamine responsiveness in yersinia enterocolitica, a bacterial pathogen whose infectious spectrum is principally limited to the gut, is limited to norepinephrine and dopamine, and not epinephrine; this behavior contrasts with observations for two pathogens with a wider extra-gastrointestinal spectrum, escherichia coli o157:h7 and salmonella enterica, which respond to all three catecholamines. epinephrine showed lower potency than norepinephrine and dopamine in inducing growth of e. coli and s. enterica, and was a potent antagonist of norepinephrine and dopamine growth responsiveness in y. enterocolitica. given that only norepinephrine and dopamine  and not epinephrine-containing neurons are found with the enteric nervous system, the results suggest that certain of the more exclusive enteric pathogens may have developed response systems preferentially for those neuroendocrine hormones that  are produced by the enteric nervous system as host-derived signals by which to sense the environment and initiate pathogenic processes.

AB  == this 1-year study was conducted to estimate the prevalence and concentrations of  pathogenic and indicator bacteria on swedish broiler chickens. a total of 636 chilled carcasses were collected from 10 slaughterhouses and sent to the national food administration for analyses of carcass rinses. no carcasses were positive for salmonella. campylobacter, predominantly campylobacter jejuni, were detected  on 15% (by enrichment) or 14% (by direct plating) of the carcasses. with one exception, all samples from late december through april were campylobacter negative. the 10th and 90th percentiles of campylobacter numbers per carcasses were 3.0 and 5.0 log cfu, respectively, and the maximum was 7.1 log cfu. coagulase-positive staphylococci were detected on 68% of the carcasses, with a maximum of 3.5 log cfu/cm2. the 10th and 90th percentiles were 3.4 and 4.4 log cfu/cm2 for total aerobic microorganisms, 1.8 and 3.3 log cfu/cm2 for enterobacteriaceae, and 2.0 and 3.6 log cfu/cm2 for escherichia coli. no correlation was found between numbers of any indicator bacteria and numbers of pathogenic bacteria. subsets of the samples were analyzed for listeria monocytogenes, clostridium perfringens, pathogenic yersinia enterocolitica, and enterococcus, resulting in prevalence estimates of 29, 18, 9 (as determined by a  pcr assay), and 97%, respectively. l. monocytogenes was most common at slaughterhouses with a low prevalence of coagulase-positive staphylococci, and vice versa. these results will improve the ability of researchers to assess the importance of chicken as a source of foodborne pathogens and can serve as a basis for risk management actions.

TI  == a microbial diagnostic microarray technique for the sensitive detection and identification of pathogenic bacteria in a background of nonpathogens.
AB  == a major challenge in microbial diagnostics is the parallel detection and identification of low-bundance pathogens within a complex microbial community. in addition, a high specificity providing robust, reliable identification at least at the species level is required. a microbial diagnostic microarray approach, using single nucleotide extension labeling with gyrb as the marker gene, was developed. we present a novel concept applying competitive oligonucleotide probes to improve the specificity of the assay. our approach enabled the sensitive and specific detection of a broad range of pathogenic bacteria. the approach was tested with a set of 35 oligonucleotide probes targeting escherichia coli, shigella spp., salmonella spp., aeromonas hydrophila, vibrio cholerae, mycobacterium avium, mycobacterium tuberculosis, helicobacter pylori, proteus mirabilis, yersinia enterocolitica, and campylobacter jejuni. the introduction of competitive oligonucleotides in the labeling reaction successfully suppressed cross-reaction by closely related sequences, significantly improving the performance of the assay. environmental applicability was tested with environmental and veterinary samples harboring complex microbial communities. detection sensitivity in the range of 0.1% has been demonstrated, far below the 5% detection limit of traditional microbial diagnostic microarrays.

TI  == the novel hha/ymoa family of nucleoid-associated proteins: use of structural mimicry to modulate the activity of the h-ns family of proteins.
AB  == the hha/ymoa family of proteins is a group of conserved, low-molecular-weight proteins involved in the regulation of gene expression. studies performed in escherichia coli, salmonella sp. and yersinia sp. highlight the contribution of these proteins in regulating bacterial virulence, horizontal gene transfer and cell physiology. genes encoding such proteins are located on chromosomes and plasmids in different genera of gram-negative bacteria. their mode of action is currently being analysed by studying direct binding of hha to dna and as a component of protein complexes with regulatory functions. recent data on the interaction of hha with the h-ns family of proteins and structural information suggest a physiological role for such protein complexes in many aspects of gene regulation.

TI  == cloning, expression and characterization of immunogenic aminopeptidase n from brucella melitensis.
AB  == a 97-kda purified aminopeptidase n (pepn) of brucella melitensis was previously identified to be immunogenic in humans. the b. melitensis pepn gene was cloned, expressed in escherichia coli and purified by affinity chromatography. the recombinant pepn (rpepn) exhibited the same biochemical properties, specificity and susceptibility to inhibitors as the native pepn. rpepn was evaluated as a diagnostic antigen in an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) using sera from patients with acute and chronic brucellosis. the specificity of the elisa was determined with sera from healthy donors. the elisa had a cutoff value  of 0.156 with 100% specificity and 100% sensitivity. higher sensitivity was obtained using rpepn compared with crude extract from b. melitensis. anti-pepn sera did not exhibit serological cross-reaction to crude extracts from rhizobium  tropici, ochrobactrum anthropi, yersinia enterocolitica 09 or e. coli o157h7.

TI  == rapid separation and concentration of food-borne pathogens in food samples prior  to quantification by viable-cell counting and real-time pcr.
AB  == buoyant density gradient centrifugation has been used to separate bacteria from complex food matrices, as well as to remove compounds that inhibit rapid detection methods, such as pcr, and to prevent false-positive results due to dna  originating from dead cells. applying a principle of buoyant density gradient centrifugation, we developed a method for rapid separation and concentration following filtration and low- and high-speed centrifugation, as well as flotation and sedimentation buoyant density centrifugation, for 12 food-borne pathogens (salmonella enterica, escherichia coli, yersinia enterocolitica, campylobacter jejuni, vibrio cholerae o139, vibrio parahaemolyticus o3k6, vibrio vulnificus, providencia alcalifaciens, aeromonas hydrophila, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus  aureus, and clostridium perfringens) in 13 different food homogenates. this method can be used prior to real-time quantitative pcr (rti-qpcr) and viable-cell counting. using this combined method, the target organisms in the food samples theoretically could be concentrated 250-fold and detected at cell concentrations  as low as 10(1) to 10(3) cfu/g using the rti-qpcr assay, and amounts as small as  10(0) to 10(1) cfu/g could be isolated using plate counting. the combined separation and concentration methods and rti-qpcr confirmed within 3 h the presence of 10(1) to 10(2) cfu/g of salmonella and c. jejuni directly in naturally contaminated chicken and the presence of s. aureus directly in remaining food items in a poisoning outbreak. these results illustrated the feasibility of using these assays for rapid inspection of bacterial food contamination during a real-world outbreak.

TI  == sensitivity of three pathogenic bacteria to turkish cemen paste and its ingredients.
AB  == pastirma is a dry cured meat product which is pasted with cemen. this paste is prepared from ground fenugreek, garlic and red hot pepper (rhpp). in this study,  the cemen mix/paste and all its ingredients were tested for their inhibitory effects on escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus and yersinia enterocolitica. all samples had a varying inhibitory effect against all the bacteria tested during 4 days of storage. complete cemen paste showed the strongest inhibitory effect on the three pathogens compared to ingredients alone. fenugreek and rhpp had a bacteriostatic effect while the cemen paste and garlic had a bactericidal effect. s. aureus was the most sensitive bacterium while y. enterocolitica was the most resistant. the results of this study confirmed the protective effect of  cemen paste and garlic in food preservation especially against e. coli, s. aureus and y. enterocolitica proving safety for public health. hence it might be concluded that cemen paste is the first hurdle to prevent bacterial contamination, and a low ph ( approximately 4.83) value would also add an additional barrier to secure safety of the product. finally, it can be suggested  that similar studies should be conducted on actual meat systems to confirm these  findings.

TI  == diarrhea etiology in a children's hospital emergency department: a prospective cohort study.
AB  == background: we evaluated the frequency of recovery of pathogens from children with diarrhea who presented to a pediatric emergency department and characterized the associated illnesses, to develop guidelines for performing a bacterial enteric culture. methods: we conducted a prospective cohort study of all patients with diarrhea who presented to a large regional pediatric emergency department during the period from november 1998 through october 2001. a thorough microbiologic evaluation was performed on stool specimens, and the findings were  correlated with case, physician, and laboratory data. results: a total of 1626 stool specimens were studied to detect diarrheagenic bacteria and, if there was a sufficient amount of stool, clostridium difficile toxin (688 specimens), parasites (656 specimens), and viruses (417 specimens). one hundred seventy-six (47%) of 372 specimens that underwent complete testing yielded a bacterial pathogen (shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli, 39 specimens [of which 28 were  serotype o157:h7]; salmonella species, 39; campylobacter species, 25; shigella species, 14; and yersinia enterocolitica, 2), a viral pathogen (rotavirus, 85 specimens; astrovirus, 27; adenovirus, 18; or rotavirus and astrovirus, 8), a diarrheagenic parasite (5 specimens); or c. difficile toxin (46 specimens). samples from 2 patients yielded both bacterial and viral pathogens. a model to identify predictors of bacterial infection found that international travel, fever, and the passing of >10 stools in the prior 24 h were associated with the presence of a bacterial pathogen. physician judgment regarding the need to perform a stool culture was almost as accurate as the model in predicting bacterial pathogens. conclusions: nearly one-half of the patients who presented to the emergency department with diarrhea had a definite or plausible pathogen in their stool specimens. we were unable to develop a model that was substantially better than physician judgment in identifying patients for whom bacterial culture would yield positive results. the unexpectedly high rate of c. difficile toxin warrants further examination.

TI  == comprehensive alanine-scanning mutagenesis of escherichia coli csra defines two subdomains of critical functional importance.
AB  == the rna-binding protein csra (carbon storage regulator) of escherichia coli is a  global regulator of gene expression and is representative of the csra/rsma family of bacterial proteins. these proteins act by regulating mrna translation and stability and are antagonized by binding to small noncoding rnas. although the rna target sequence and structure for csra binding have been well defined, little information exists concerning the protein requirements for rna recognition. the three-dimensional structures of three csra/rsma proteins were recently solved, revealing a novel protein fold consisting of two interdigitated monomers. here, we performed comprehensive alanine-scanning mutagenesis on csra of e. coli and tested the 58 resulting mutants for regulation of glycogen accumulation, motility, and biofilm formation. quantitative effects of these mutations on expression of glgca'-'lacz, flhdc'-'lacz, and pgaa'-'lacz translational fusions were also examined, and eight of the mutant proteins were purified and tested for rna binding. these studies identified two regions of the amino acid sequence that were critical for regulation and rna binding, located within the first (beta1, residues 2-7) and containing the last (beta5, residues 40-47) beta-strands of csra. the beta1 and beta5 strands of opposite monomers lie adjacent and parallel  to each other in the three-dimensional structure of this protein. given the symmetry of the csra dimer, these findings imply that two distinct rna binding surfaces or functional subdomains lie on opposite sides of the protein.

TI  == enhancement of mice susceptibility to infection with listeria monocytogenes by the treatment of morphine.
AB  == the effect of morphine on the susceptibility of balb/c mice to diarrheagenic escherichia coli, shigella flexneri, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella enteritidis, yersinia enterocolitica, was examined via the intraperitoneal inoculation. morphine treatment increased the susceptibility to s. enteritidis and l. monocytogenes, resulting in bacteremia and central nervous system (cns) invasion (for l. monocytogenes), while the infection with other bacteria did not  show the systemic dissemination in the morphinetreated mice. notably, l. monocytogenes infection caused 100% mortality with a mean survival time (mst) of  1.3 days in morphine-treated mice, but untreated mice did not die. the present data suggested that individuals using heroin or treated with morphine derivatives might be at high risk for listeriosis, especially those who are immunocompromised. recent increasing consumption of morphine may propose the necessity for further epidemiological surveillance on infectious diseases.

TI  == inactivation of gram-negative bacteria in milk and banana juice by hen egg white  and lambda lysozyme under high hydrostatic pressure.
AB  == the effect of hen egg white lysozyme (hewl) and bacteriophage lambda lysozyme (lal) in combination with high pressure (hp) treatment on the inactivation of four gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli o157:h7, shigella flexneri, yersinia enterocolitica and salmonella typhimurium), was studied in skim milk (ph 6.8; a(w) 0.997) and in banana juice (ph 3.8; a(w) 0.971). in the absence of lysozymes, s. flexneri was more sensitive to hp in milk than in banana juice, while the opposite was observed for the other three bacteria. in combination with hp treatment, lal was more effective than hewl on all bacteria in both milk and banana juice. depending on the bacteria, inactivation levels in banana juice were increased from 0.4-2.7 log units by hp treatment alone to 3.6-6.5 log units in the presence of 224 u/ml lal. bacterial inactivation in milk was also enhanced by lal but only by 0.5-2.1 log units. under the experimental conditions used, lal was more effective in banana juice than in milk, while the effectiveness of hewl  under the same conditions was not significantly affected by the food matrix. this effect could be ascribed to the low ph of the banana juice since lal was also more effective on e. coli in buffer at ph 3.8 than at ph 6.8. since neither lal nor hewl are enzymatically active at ph 3.8, we analysed bacterial lysis after hp treatment in the presence of these enzymes, and found that inactivation proceeds  through a non-lytic mechanism at ph 3.8 and a lytic mechanism at ph 6.8. based on these results, lal may offer interesting perspectives for use as an extra hurdle  in high pressure food preservation.

TI  == a survey of foodborne pathogens in bulk tank milk and raw milk consumption among  farm families in pennsylvania.
AB  == a 2-part study was conducted to determine the risk of exposure to human pathogens from raw milk. the first part of the study focused on determining raw milk consumption habits of dairy producers. a total of 248 dairy producers from 16 counties in pennsylvania were surveyed. overall, 105 (42.3%) of the 248 dairy producers consumed raw milk and 170 (68.5%) of the 248 dairy producers were aware of foodborne pathogens in raw milk. dairy producers who were not aware of foodborne pathogens in raw milk were 2-fold more likely to consume raw milk compared with dairy producers who were aware of foodborne pathogens. the majority of dairy producers who consumed raw milk indicated that taste (72%) and convenience (60%) were the primary factors for consuming raw milk. dairy producers who resided on the dairy farm were nearly 3-fold more likely to consume raw milk compared with those who lived elsewhere. in the second part of the study, bulk tank milk from the 248 participating dairy herds was examined for foodborne pathogens. campylobacter jejuni (2%), shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli (2.4%), listeria monocytogenes (2.8%), salmonella (6%), and yersinia enterocolitica (1.2%) were detected in the milk samples. salmonella isolates were identified as s. enterica serotype typhimurium (n = 10) and s. enterica serotype  newport (n = 5). of the 248 bulk tank milk samples, 32 (13%) contained > or = 1 species of bacterial pathogens. the findings of the study could assist in developing farm community-based educational programs on the risks of consuming raw milk.

TI  == independent acquisition of site-specific recombination factors by asn trna gene-targeting genomic islands.
AB  == two genomic islands, namely the high-pathogenicity island (hpi) and ecoc54n target the same asn trna genes to integrate into the bacterial chromosome. the hpi encodes the siderophore yersiniabactin in the highly pathogenic yersinia group (yersinia pestis, yersinia pseudotuberculosis and yersinia enterocolitica 1b) whilst the ecoc54n island possibly encodes a polyketide synthase with an unknown function in the uropathogenic escherichia coli cft073 strain. hpi encodes the recombinase that promotes site-specific recombination (both integrative and excisive) with its corresponding attachment targets. a recombinase orthologue is  also present in ecoc54n. in addition, the hpi(yps) of the y. pestis/y. pseudotuberculosis evolutionary lineage encodes the excisionase (recombination directionality factor, xis(hpi)) that facilitates excision of the island. however, no sequence resembling the excisionase gene could be found in ecoc54n. the rate of the hpi(yps) excision estimated by real-time pcr was 10(-6) in y. pseudotuberculosis. the presence of the excisionase increased the efficiency of the excisive recombination only eight fold. however, the introduction of the xis(hpi) in e. coli cft073 did not influence the excision of ecoc54n. the xis(hpi) is encoded by the variable at-rich part of the hpi(yps) and substantially differs from its cognate recombinase in a+t content and codon usage. also the xis(hpi)-protected region, defined in the hpi attachment site, has suffered several nucleotide substitutions in ecoc54n that could influence interaction with the excisionase. we propose that the pathogenicity islands (pais) targeting asn trna genes (pais(asn trna)) might have acquired recombinase  and excisionase (hpi) genes independently and sequentially.

AB  == yersinia species pathogenic to human benefit from a protein transport machinery,  a type three secretion system (t3ss), which enables the bacteria to inject effector proteins into host cells. several of the transport substrates of the yersinia t3ss, called yops (yersinia outer proteins), are assisted by specific chaperones (syc for specific yop chaperone) prior to transport. yersinia enterocolitica sycd (lcrh in yersinia pestis and yersinia pseudotuberculosis) is  a chaperone dedicated to the assistance of the translocator proteins yopb and yopd, which are assumed to form a pore in the host cell membrane. in an attempt to make sycd amenable to structural investigations we recombinantly expressed sycd with a hexahistidine tag in escherichia coli. combining immobilized nickel affinity chromatography and gel filtration we obtained purified sycd with an exceptional yield of 120mg per liter of culture and homogeneity above 95%. analytical gel filtration and cross-linking experiments revealed the formation of homodimers in solution. secondary structure analysis based on circular dichroism  suggests that sycd is mainly composed of alpha-helical elements. to prove functionality of purified sycd previously suggested interactions of sycd with yop secretion protein m2 (yscm2), and low calcium response protein v (lcrv), respectively, were reinvestigated.

AB  == background: the prevalence of bacterial contamination of random-donor platelet concentrates (pcs) is considerably lower than that of blood donations. which key  steps of the preparation procedure contribute to the elimination of bacteria was  investigated. study design and methods: ten bacteria species were used. blood donations were spiked with bacteria and stored at 22 degrees c for 8 hours. the buffy coats were kept for 6 hours. pcs were prepared from pools of 4 buffy coats. at each preparation step and during pc storage, bacteria contents were measured.  in additional experiments, the titers of spiked blood and buffy coats were determined after storage at 20, 22, or 24 degrees c for 8 and up to 24 hours, respectively. results: enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, and yersinia enterocolitica were completely inactivated during storage in blood or buffy coats. titer reduction was between 3.32 and 4.62 log. bacillus cereus, propionibacterium acnes, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis did not multiply. compared with their values in spiked blood the titers in the pcs were reduced by 1.7 to 2.8 log. klebsiella pneumoniae was the only species that grew in blood. with the exception of p. acnes, those species that were not removed by the preparation process multiplied in the pcs. remarkable donor-to-donor variations of the bactericidal activities of buffy coats were detected when the storage time was prolonged to 24 hours. conclusions: bacteria are significantly eliminated by the preparation procedure for random donor pcs. also, blood and buffy coats are bactericidal for  most species. when buffy-coat storage is prolonged, it cannot, however, be predicted whether specific strains vanish or multiply.

AB  == the salmonella and related bacteria modify the structure of the lipid a portion of their lipopolysaccharide in response to environmental stimuli. some lipid a modifications are required for virulence and resistance to cationic antimicrobial peptides. we now demonstrate that membranes of salmonella typhimurium contain a novel hydrolase that removes the 3'-acyloxyacyl residue of lipid a in the presence of 5 mm ca2+. we have identified the gene encoding the s. typhimurium lipid a 3'-o-deacylase, designated lpxr, by screening an ordered s. typhimurium genomic dna library, harbored in escherichia coli k-12, for expression of ca2+-dependent 3'-o-deacylase activity in membranes. lpxr is synthesized with an  n-terminal type i signal peptide and is localized to the outer membrane. mass spectrometry was used to confirm the position of lipid a deacylation in vitro and the release of the intact 3'-acyloxyacyl group. heterologous expression of lpxr in the e. coli k-12 w3110, which lacks lpxr, resulted in production of significant amounts of 3'-o-deacylated lipid a in growing cultures. orthologues of lpxr are present in the genomes of e. coli o157:h7, yersinia enterocolitica, helicobacter pylori, and vibrio cholerae. the function of lpxr is unknown, but it could play a role in pathogenesis because it might modulate the cytokine response of an infected animal.

AB  == a rapid bead assay for detecting pathogenic bacteria with a simple microfluidic chip-based system was developed. five oligonucleotide probes corresponding to the 16s rrna of the targeted bacteria were coupled covalently to fluorescent beads. four species of bacteria (escherichia coli, salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar enteritidis, yersinia enterocolitica, and bacillus cereus) were used as representative food-borne pathogenic bacteria. the rnas extracted from pure cultures of these microorganisms were fluorescently labeled and hybridized to the oligonucleotide probes-immobilized fluorescent beads (bead assay). the duplexes of rnas and the probes-immobilized beads were analyzed with the commercially available microfluidic chip-based system. this bead assay provided results within 3 h following rna extraction from bacterial cells.

TI  == yopm of yersinia enterocolitica specifically interacts with alpha1-antitrypsin without affecting the anti-protease activity.
AB  == it was previously shown that alpha1-antitrypsin (aat) interacts with the type iii secreted (t3s) espb and espd proteins of enteropathogenic escherichia coli (epec), resulting in reduced functionality of the proteins. to determine if aat is also able to interact with t3s proteins of other pathogens, the binding of aat to yop proteins of yersinia enterocolitica was analysed. aat did not interact with yopb or yopd, which have functions in type iii translocation similar to espb and espd in epec, but specifically interacts with yopm, a member of the leucine-rich repeat (lrr) family of proteins, in overlay and pull-down assays. to determine regions of yopm involved in aat binding, various n- and c-terminally truncated versions of yopm were recombinantly expressed, and their ability to interact with aat analysed. all versions tested were able to bind aat, indicating that at least eight lrr of yopm are sufficient for aat interaction. the main physiological role of aat is to inhibit neutrophil elastase; however, elastase was efficiently inhibited by aat in the presence and absence of yopm, indicating  that yopm does not interfere with the anti-protease inhibition activity of aat, and that the domain of aat interacting with yopm is not identical to aat's protease interaction domain. furthermore, it was shown that elastase efficiently  degrades yopm and other yop proteins. the data suggest that aat has additional functions in the host response against bacterial infections that are not related  to its anti-protease activity.

TI  == multiple promoters control expression of the yersinia enterocolitica phage-shock-protein a (pspa) operon.
AB  == the widely conserved phage-shock-protein a (pspa) operon encodes an extracytoplasmic stress response system that is essential for virulence in yersinia enterocolitica, and has been linked to other important phenotypes in escherichia coli, salmonella enterica and shigella flexneri. regulation of pspa operon expression is mediated through a promoter upstream of pspa that depends on sigma factor rpon (sigma(54)) and the enhancer binding protein pspf. pspa, pspb and pspc, encoded within the pspa operon, also regulate expression by participating in a putative signal transduction pathway that probably serves to modulate pspf activity. all of this suggests that appropriate expression of the pspa operon is critical. previous genetic analysis of the y. enterocolitica pspa  operon suggested that an additional level of complexity might be mediated by pspf/rpon-independent expression of some psp genes. here, an rpon null mutation and interposon analysis were used to confirm that pspf/rpon-independent gene expression does originate within the psp locus. molecular genetic approaches were used to systematically analyse the two large non-coding regions within the psp locus. primer extension, control region deletion and site-directed mutagenesis experiments led to the identification of rpon-independent promoters both upstream and downstream of pspa. the precise location of the pspf/rpon-dependent promoter  upstream of pspa was also determined. the discovery of these rpon-independent promoters reveals yet another level of transcriptional complexity for the y. enterocolitica pspa operon that may function to allow low-level constitutive expression of psp genes and/or additional regulation under some conditions.

TI  == is the enthesitis-related arthritis subtype of juvenile idiopathic arthritis a form of chronic reactive arthritis?
AB  == objective: enteric organisms are known to trigger reactive arthritis. the enthesitis-related arthritis (era) form of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (jia) clinically resembles reactive arthritis. therefore, we looked for a role of enteric bacteria in era. methods: synovial fluid (sf) was obtained from 26 patients with era and 10 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (ra). blood specimens were also obtained from patients with era and from 10 normal individuals. lymphocyte proliferation assays were done on whole blood and sf mononuclear cells using as antigens crude lysates of the enteric bacteria salmonella typhimurium, yersinia enterocolitica, shigella flexneri and campylobacter jejuni. crude lysate of escherichia coli was used as a control antigen. hla-b27 typing was done using  the polymerase chain reaction. homing of gut-specific t cells (cd103+) to the synovial compartment was studied using tri-colour flow cytometry. the antigen-specific cytokine profile was determined by flow cytometry. results: antigen-specific lymphoproliferative responses were observed in 14 of 26 patients. among these patients, 12 showed a response in sf (four each to s. typhimurium and c. jejuni, and in two each to s. flexneri and y. enterocolitica), and two patients in blood (s. typhimurium in both). none of the healthy controls  showed a response in the blood. lymphoproliferative responses in sf were more frequent in patients with jia (12/26) than in controls with ra (1/10, p < 0.05).  patients with an antigen-specific response had a higher ratio of sf/blood cd103+  t cells compared with those with no antigen-specific response (p < 0.01). antigen-specific as well as mitogen-stimulated cytokine production showed a th1 bias. conclusion: enteric bacteria may have a role in exacerbation of disease in  patients with era. the immune response in patients with era is th1-dominant.

TI  == comparison of bactericidal activity of six lysozymes at atmospheric pressure and  under high hydrostatic pressure.
AB  == the antibacterial working range of six lysozymes was tested under ambient and high pressure, on a panel of five gram-positive (enterococcus faecalis, bacillus  subtilis, listeria innocua, staphylococcus aureus and micrococcus lysodeikticus)  and five gram-negative bacteria (yersinia enterocolitica, shigella flexneri, escherichia coli o157:h7, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella typhimurium). the lysozymes included two that are commercially available (hen egg white lysozyme or hewl, and mutanolysin from streptomyces globisporus or m1l), and four that were chromatographically purified (bacteriophage lambda lysozyme or lal, bacteriophage t4 lysozyme or t4l, goose egg white lysozyme or gewl, and cauliflower lysozyme or cfl). t4l, lal and gewl were highly pure as evaluated by silver staining of sds-page gels and zymogram analysis while cfl was only partially pure. at ambient pressure each gram-positive test organism displayed a specific pattern of sensitivity to the six lysozymes, but none of the gram-negative bacteria was sensitive to any of the lysozymes. high pressure treatment (130-300 mpa, 25 degrees c, 15 min) sensitised several gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria for one or more lysozymes. m. lysodeikticus and p. aeruginosa became sensitive to all lysozymes under high pressure, s. typhimurium remained completely insensitive to all lysozymes, and the other bacteria showed sensitisation to some of the lysozymes. the possible applications of the different lysozymes as biopreservatives, and the possible reasons for the observed differences in bactericidal specificity are discussed.

TI  == pspb and pspc of yersinia enterocolitica are dual function proteins: regulators and effectors of the phage-shock-protein response.
AB  == the phage-shock-protein (psp) stress-response system is conserved in many bacteria and has been linked to important phenotypes in escherichia coli, salmonella enterica and also yersinia enterocolitica, where it is essential for virulence. it is activated by specific extracytoplasmic stress events such as the mislocalization of secretin proteins. from studies of the psp system in e. coli,  the cytoplasmic membrane proteins pspb and pspc have only been proposed to act as positive regulators of psp gene expression. however, in this study we show that pspb and pspc of y. enterocolitica are dual function proteins, acting both as regulators and effectors of the psp system. consistent with the current model, they positively control psp gene expression in response to diverse inducing cues. pspb and pspc must work together to achieve this regulatory function, and bacterial two-hybrid (bacth) analysis demonstrated a specific interaction between them, which was confirmed by in vivo cross-linking. we also show that pspb and pspc play a second role in supporting growth when a secretin protein is overexpressed. this function is independent from their role as regulators of psp  gene expression. furthermore, whereas pspb and pspc must work together for their  regulatory function, they can apparently act independently to support growth during secretin production. this study expands the current understanding of the roles played by pspb and pspc, and demonstrates that they cannot be considered only as positive regulators of psp gene expression in y. enterocolitica.

TI  == foodborne bacterial infection and hospitalization: a registry-based study.
AB  == background: foodborne bacterial gastrointestinal infections are important causes  of morbidity and mortality worldwide, and despite successful control programs in  some developed countries, these infections continue to have a major impact on public health and economy. methods: on the basis of data from 3 national registries, we determined short- and long-term risks of hospitalization due to gastroenteritis, short-term complications, and long-term sequelae after infections with nontyphoid salmonella enterica, campylobacter species, yersinia enterocolitica, diarrheagenic escherichia coli, and shigella species. results: among 52,121 patients, 7524 (14.4%) were hospitalized with a diagnosis of gastroenteritis within 90 days after microbiological diagnosis. a total of 4941 patients (17.7%) with infections due to s. enterica and 1937 (10.8%) with infections due to campylobacter species were admitted to the hospital. complications, such as gastrointestinal perforation and invasive illness, occurred in 647 patients (1.2%). the risk of invasive illness was > 6-fold higher in patients with infections due to s. enterica (odds ratio [or] compared with the general population, 30.3; 95% confidence interval [ci], 26.2-35.1) than in those  with infections due to campylobacter species (or, 4.9; 95% ci, 3.5-6.8) (p < .001). long-term sequelae were seen in 865 patients (1.7%). among 1000 patients with infections due to s. enterica, 1820 days of hospital stay were attributable  to gastroenteritis, complications, and long-term sequelae. the corresponding figure for campylobacter infections was 714 days. conclusions: infections with bacteria that are usually foodborne cause considerable morbidity, in terms of severe gastroenteritis that requires admission to hospital, as well as complications and long-term sequelae. the risk of complications and sequelae depends on bacterial species, and nontyphoid salmonella is particularly associated with a burden of severe morbidity.

TI  == sensitivities of foodborne pathogens to pressure changes.
AB  == eight foodborne pathogens were suspended in ultrahigh-temperature whole milk and  treated at pressure levels of 0.1 to 690 mpa at 21.5 degrees c for 10 min. there  was no clear trend in pressure resistance between gram-negative and gram-positive organisms. the order of the single strains tested, from most to least pressure sensitive, was vibrio parahaemolyticus < yersinia enterocolitica < listeria monocytogenes < salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium < s. enterica serovar enteritidis < escherichia coli o157:h7 approximately equal to staphylococcus aureus < shigella flexneri. for each organism there existed a pressure range in which log(number of survivors) had a near linear relationship when plotted versus treatment pressure level. in this study, a decimal reduction pressure (dp) value  was defined and used to measure the sensitivity of these pathogens to pressure changes. l. monocytogenes and v. parahaemolyticus were most sensitive to pressure changes, and s. flexneri was most resistant. the d(p) values were 16.3 mpa for l. monocytogenes, 21.7 mpa for v. parahaemolyticus, and 127.0 mpa for s. flexneri. the most pressure-resistant gram-negative bacterium, s. flexneri, and most pressure-resistant gram-positive bacterium, s. aureus, were treated at 50 degrees c and pressures of 0.1 to 650 mpa for 10 min. high temperature considerably enhanced pressure inactivation of these two organisms and affected their sensitivities to pressure changes. the effect of treatment time on the d(p) values of l. monocytogenes and v. parahaemolyticus was also determined, and it was found that it did not significantly affect their d(p) values.

TI  == purification of the yada membrane anchor for secondary structure analysis and crystallization.
AB  == non-fimbrial adhesins, such as yersinia yada, moraxella uspa1 and a2, haemophilus hia and hsf, or bartonella bada, represent an important class of molecules by which pathogenic proteobacteria adhere to their hosts. they form trimeric surface structures with a head-rod-anchor architecture. whereas their head and rod domains may be of heterologous origin, their anchor domains are homologous and display the properties of autotransporters. conflicting topology models exist for these membrane anchors. here, we describe the expression and purification of the  membrane anchor of yada from yersinia enterocolitica for structural biology experiments. we expressed yada-m in the escherichia coli outer membrane. after solubilization and purification, it is a trimer of extreme stability. using protein ftir and secondary structure analysis, we show that the anchor is a beta-barrel, but contains a helical part at its n-terminus. we have crystallized  the protein under various conditions and present x-ray data to 3.8 a resolution.

TI  == basics of flow cytometry-based sterility testing of platelet concentrates.
AB  == background: flow cytometry (facs) is a common technique in blood banking. it is used, for example, for the enumeration of residual white blood cells in plasma and in cellular blood products. it was investigated whether it can also be applied for sterility testing of buffy coat-derived platelet concentrates (pcs).  study design and methods: plasma-reduced pcs were spiked with bacteria and stored at 20 to 24 or 37 degrees c for various times. the following 10 species were used: bacillus cereus, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, propionibacterium acnes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, serratia marcescens, and yersinia enterocolitica. bacterial dna was stained with thiazole orange. after the platelets were lysed, bacteria were enumerated by facs. results: all bacteria species used were detectable by facs. the lower detection limit was approximately 100 bacteria per microl, that is, 10(5) per ml. in general, the titers measured were 1.2- to 3-fold higher than those determined by colony forming assay. in one  case (k. pneumoniae) in which the dot plot of the bacteria cloud overlapped with  that of bacteria debris, they were consistently lower. when pc samples were inoculated with approximately 1 colony-forming unit per ml of bacteria and kept at 37 degrees c, most species were detected within 21 hours or less. exceptions were e. cloacae and p. acnes, which were detected after 24 to 40 and 64 hours, respectively. at 20 to 24 degrees c, the detection times were strongly prolonged. conclusion: sterility testing of pcs by facs is a feasible approach. the present  data suggest incubating pc samples for 20 to 24 hours at 37 degrees c before testing. for slow-growing bacteria, the incubation period must be prolonged by 1  to 2 days.

TI  == functional analysis of the post-transcriptional regulator rsma reveals a novel rna-binding site.
AB  == the rsma family of rna-binding proteins are global post-transcriptional regulators that mediate extensive changes in gene expression in bacteria. they bind to, and affect the translation rate of target mrnas, a function that is further modulated by one or more, small, untranslated competitive regulatory rnas. to gain new insights into the nature of this protein/rna interaction, we used x-ray crystallography to solve the structure of the yersinia enterocolitica  rsma homologue. rsma consists of a dimeric beta barrel from which two alpha helices are projected. from structure-based alignments of the rsma protein family from diverse bacteria, we identified key amino acid residues likely to be involved in rna-binding. site-specific mutagenesis revealed that arginine at position 44, located at the n terminus of the alpha helix is essential for biological activity in vivo and rna-binding in vitro. mutation of this site affects swarming motility, exoenzyme and secondary metabolite production in the human pathogen pseudomonas aeruginosa, carbon metabolism in escherichia coli, and hydrogen cyanide production in the plant beneficial strain pseudomonas fluorescens cha0. r44a mutants are also unable to interact with the small untranslated rna, rsmz. thus, although possessing a motif similar to the kh domain of some eukaryotic rna-binding proteins, rsma differs substantially and incorporates a novel class of rna-binding site.

TI  == waterborne pathogen detection by use of oligonucleotide-based microarrays.
AB  == a small-oligonucleotide microarray prototype was designed with probes specific for the universal 16s rrna and cpn60 genes of several pathogens that are usually  encountered in wastewaters. in addition to these two targets, wece-specific oligonucleotide probes were included in the microarray to enhance its discriminating power within the enterobacteriaceae family. universal pcr primers  were used to amplify variable regions of 16s rrna, cpn60, and wece genes directly in escherichia coli and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium genomic dna mixtures (binary); e. coli, s. enterica serovar typhimurium, and yersinia enterocolitica genomic dna mixtures (ternary); or wastewater total dna. amplified products were fluorescently labeled and hybridized on the prototype chip. the detection sensitivity for s. enterica serovar typhimurium was estimated to be on  the order of 0.1% (10(4) s. enterica genomes) of the total dna for the combination of pcr followed by microarray hybridization. the sensitivity of the prototype could be increased by hybridizing amplicons generated by pcr targeting  genes specific for a bacterial subgroup, such as wece genes, instead of universal taxonomic amplicons. however, there was evidence of pcr bias affecting the detection limits of a given pathogen as increasing amounts of a different pathogen were spiked into the test samples. these results demonstrate the feasibility of using dna microarrays in the detection of waterborne pathogens within mixed populations but also raise the problem of pcr bias in such experiments.

AB  == using standard microbiological procedures, bacteria that are potentially pathogenic to humans were isolated from 150 houseflies collected in the libyan city of misurata (50 flies each from the central hospital, streets and abattoir). salmonella spp., yersinia enterocolitica and edwardsiella tarda were isolated from flies collected on the streets and in the abattoir but not from those collected in the hospital. shigella sonnei was detected in just one fly, which was collected in the abattoir. of the flies collected in the hospital, streets and abattor, 42%, 42% and 32% were positive for escherichia coli, 70%, 50% and 62% for klebsiella spp., 2%, 20% and 10% for aeromonas spp., 96%, 36% and 34% for pseudomonas spp., 20%, 12% and 16% for staphylococcus spp., and 24%, 22% and 18%  for streptococcus spp., respectively. when the antibiotic susceptibilities of the fly isolates were investigated, the enterobacteria isolated from the houseflies collected in the hospital were found to be resistant to significantly more of the commonly used antibiotics that were tested than the enterobacteria isolated from  the flies caught in the streets or abattoir. whatever the source of the flies from which they were collected, the pseudomonas isolates frequently showed resistance to multiple antibiotics, with >50% each being resistant to at least 10 antimicrobial agents. two isolates of sta. aureus (both from flies collected in the hospital) were resistant to methicillin. the present study supports the belief that the housefly is a potential vector of multiple-antibiotic-resistant,  pathogenic bacteria, including methicillin-resistant sta. aureus, in the hospital environment. given their mobility, it seems likely that houseflies carry such pathogens from hospitals to surrounding communities, and vice versa.

TI  == membrane damage and microbial inactivation by chlorine in the absence and presence of a chlorine-demanding substrate.
AB  == the relationship between cell inactivation and membrane damage was studied in two gram-positive organisms, listeria monocytogenes and bacillus subtilis, and two gram-negative organisms, yersinia enterocolitica and escherichia coli, exposed to chlorine in the absence and presence of 150 ppm of organic matter (trypticase soy broth). l. monocytogenes and b. subtilis were more resistant to chlorine in distilled water. the addition of small amounts of organic matter to the chlorination medium drastically increased the resistance of both types of microorganisms, but this effect was more marked in y. enterocolitica and e. coli. in addition, the survival curves for these microorganisms in the presence of organic matter had a prolonged shoulder. sublethal injury was not detected under  most experimental conditions, and only gram-positive cells treated in distilled water showed a relevant degree of injury. the exposure of bacterial cells to chlorine in distilled water caused extensive permeabilization of the cytoplasmic  membrane, but the concentrations required were much higher than those needed to inactivate cells. therefore, there was no relationship between the occurrence of  membrane permeabilization and cell death. the addition of organic matter to the treatment medium stabilized the cytoplasmic membrane against permeabilization in  both the gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria investigated. exposure of e. coli cells to the outer membrane-permeabilizing agent edta increased their sensitivity to chlorine and caused the shoulders in the survival curves to disappear. based on these observations, we propose that bacterial envelopes could play a role in cell inactivation by modulating the access of chlorine to the key  targets within the cell.

AB  == in this study, sigla (liquidambar orientalis mill.) storax (styrax) was investigated for antibacterial activity against aeromonas hydrophila, bacillus amyloliquefaciens, b. brevis, b. cereus, b. megaterium, b. subtilis, corynebacterium xerosis, enterobacter aerogenes, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, e. coli o157:h7, klebsiella pneumoniae, listeria monocytogenes, micrococcus luteus, mycobacterium smegmatis, proteus vulgaris, pseudomonas aeruginosa, p. fluorescens, staphylococcus aureus and yersinia enterocolitica. the storax was dissolved in absolute ethanol and was tested at concentrations of  10.0%, 1.0%, 0.4%, 0.2% and 0.1%. pure ethanol was used for the control. the antibacterial activity of the sigla storax was determined by using the agar diffusion method. the growths of a. hydrophila, b. amyloliquefaciens, b. megaterium, e. coli, e. coli o157:h7, l. monocytogenes and y. enterocolitica were not inhibited by any of the concentrations of sigla storax. the results showed that sigla storax has antibacterial activity against many bacteria at concentrations of 10.0% and against some bacteria at concentrations of 1.0%, 0.4% and 0.2%.

TI  == an amino-terminal secretion signal is required for ypla export by the ysa, ysc, and flagellar type iii secretion systems of yersinia enterocolitica biovar 1b.
AB  == yersinia enterocolitica biovar 1b maintains three distinct type iii secretion (tts) systems, which independently operate to target proteins to extracellular sites. the ysa and ysc systems are prototypical contact-dependent tts systems that translocate toxic effectors to the cytosols of targeted eukaryotic host cells during infection. the flagellar tts system is utilized during the assembly  of the flagellum and is required for secretion of the virulence-associated phospholipase ypla to the bacterial milieu. when ectopically produced, ypla is also a secretion substrate for the ysa and ysc tts systems. in this study, we define elements that allow ypla recognition and export by the ysa, ysc, and flagellar tts systems. fusion of various amino-terminal regions of ypla to escherichia coli alkaline phosphatase (phoa) lacking its native secretion signal  demonstrated that the first 20 amino acids or corresponding mrna codons of ypla were sufficient for export of ypla-phoa chimeras by each tts system. export of native ypla by each of the three tts systems was also found to depend on the integrity of its amino terminus. introduction of a frameshift mutation or deletion of ypla sequences encoding the amino-terminal 20 residues negatively impacted ypla secretion. deletion of other ypla regions was tolerated, including  that resulting in the removal of amino acid residues 30 through 40 of the polypeptide and removal of the 5' untranslated region of the mrna. this work supports a model in which independent and distantly related tts systems of y. enterocolitica recognize protein substrates by a similar mechanism.

TI  == synergistic antimicrobial activity of tea & antibiotics.
AB  == tea leaves are known for its antibacterial activity against many microorganisms.  in this study we attempted to describe the synergistic antimicrobial activity of  tea and antibiotics against enteropathogens. antimicrobial activity of boiled water tea extract and organic solvent extract were studied against salmonella typhimurium 1402/84, s. typhi, s. typhi ty2a, shigella dysenteriae, yersinia enterocolitica c770, and escherichia coli (epec p2 1265) determining minimum inhibitory concentration (mic), minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) and death rate kinetics at mbc of tea extract in presence of subinhibitory concentration of antibiotic. both green tea or black tea extracts effectively inhibited the growth of s. typhimurium 1402/84, s. typhi, s. typhi ty2a, s. dysenteriae, y. enterocolitica c770, and e.coli (epec p2 1265). however, the growth inhibitory concentration of tea extract was lower for green tea as compared to black tea extract. antimicrobial activity of green tea tea methanol:  water extract tea was better as compared to boiled water tea extract of green tea. based on death rate kinetics results, s.typhi ty2a appeared to be highly sensitive and y. enterocolitica c770 the most resistant. chloramphenicol and tea  extract in combination inhibited the growth of s.dysenteriae at 2.5 microg/ml chloramphenicol (mic 5 microg/ml) and 5.094 mg/ml black tea extract (mic 9.089 mg/ml). tea extract showed synergistic activity with chloramphenicol and other antibiotics like gentamycin, methicillin and nalidixic acid against test strains.

TI  == solid- and vapor-phase antimicrobial activities of six essential oils: susceptibility of selected foodborne bacterial and fungal strains.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of essential oils (eos) of cinnamon (cinnamon zeylanicum), clove (syzygium aromaticum), basil (ocimum basillicum), rosemary (rosmarinus officinalis), dill (anethum graveolens), and ginger (zingiber officinalis) was evaluated over a range of concentrations in two types of contact tests (solid and vapor diffusion). the eos were tested against an array of four gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, and listeria monocytogenes), four gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, yersinia enterocolitica, salmonella choleraesuis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa), and three fungi (a yeast, candida albicans, and two molds, penicillium islandicum and aspergillus flavus). the rationale for this work was to test the possibility of creating a protective atmosphere by using natural compounds that could extend the shelf life of packaged foodstuffs while minimizing organoleptic alterations. in the solid diffusion tests, cinnamon and clove gave the strongest (and very similar) inhibition, followed by basil and rosemary, with dill and ginger giving the weakest inhibition. the fungi were the  most sensitive microorganisms, followed by the gram-positive bacterial strains. the gram-negative strain p. aeruginosa was the least inhibited. the composition of the atmosphere generated by the eos, and their minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics), were determined using a disk volatilization method, in which no inhibition from rosemary or basil was observed. cinnamon and clove, once again, gave similar results for every microorganism. as a general rule, mic (fungi) << mic (bacteria) with no clear differences between gram-positive or -negative strains except for p. aeruginosa, which was not inhibited by any of the eos in the vapor phase. the atmosphere generated from the eos was analyzed by means of solid-phase microextraction combined with gas chromatography-ion trap mass spectrometry. differences among the volatiles in the eos, which may be responsible for the differences in their antimicrobial performances, were found.

TI  == simultaneous display of multiple foreign peptides in the flid capping and flic filament proteins of the escherichia coli flagellum.
AB  == the bacterial flagellum is composed of more than 20 different proteins. the filament, which constitutes the major extracellular part of the flagellum, is built up of approximately 20,000 flic molecules that assemble at the growing distal end of the filament. a capping structure composed of five flid molecules located at the tip of the filament promotes polymerization of flic. lack of flid  leads to release of the subunits into the growth medium. we show here that flid can be successfully used in bacterial surface display. we tested various insertion sites in the capping protein, and the optimal region for display was at the variable region in flid. deletion and/or insertion at other sites resulted in decreased formation of flagella. we further developed the technique into a multihybrid display system in which three foreign peptides are simultaneously expressed within the same flagellum, i.e., d repeats of fnbpa from staphylococcus aureus at the tip and fragments of yada from yersinia enterocolitica as well as slpa from lactobacillus crispatus along the filament. this technology can have biotechnological applications, e.g., in simultaneous delivery of several effector molecules.

TI  == the phage-shock-protein response.
AB  == the phage-shock-protein (psp) system responds to extracytoplasmic stress that may reduce the energy status of the cell. it is conserved in many different bacteria  and has been linked to several important phenotypes. escherichia coli psp mutants have defects in maintenance of the proton-motive force, protein export by the sec and tat pathways, survival in stationary phase at alkaline ph, and biofilm formation. yersinia enterocolitica psp mutants cannot grow when the secretin component of a type iii secretion system is mislocalized, and have a severe virulence defect in animals. a salmonella enterica psp mutation exacerbates some  phenotypes of an rpoe null mutant and the psp genes of s. enterica and shigella flexneri are highly induced during macrophage infection. pspa, the most abundant  of the psp proteins, is required for most of the phenotypes associated with the psp system. therefore, pspa is probably an effector that may play a role in maintaining cytoplasmic membrane integrity and/or the proton-motive force. however, pspa is not required for the ability to tolerate secretin mislocalization, which suggests an important physiological role for other psp proteins. this article summarizes our current understanding of the psp system: inducing signals, the underlying signal transduction mechanisms, the physiological roles it may play, and a genomic analysis of its conservation.

TI  == mechanistic and inhibition studies of chorismate-utilizing enzymes.
AB  == the shikimate biosynthetic pathway is utilized in algae, higher plants, bacteria, fungi and apicomplexan parasites; it involves seven enzymatic steps in which phosphoenolpyruvate and erythrose 4-phosphate are converted into chorismate. in escherichia coli, five chorismate-utilizing enzymes catalyse the synthesis of aromatic compounds such as l-phenylalanine, l-tyrosine, l-tryptophan, folate, ubiquinone and siderophores such as yersiniabactin and enterobactin. as mammals do not possess such a biosynthetic system, the enzymes involved in the pathway have aroused considerable interest as potential targets for the development of antimicrobial drugs and herbicides. as an initiative to investigate the mechanism of some of these enzymes, we showed that the antimicrobial effect of (6s)-6-fluoroshikimate is the result of irreversible inhibition of 4-amino-4-deoxychorismate synthase by 2-fluorochorismate. based on this study, a  catalytic mechanism for this enzyme was proposed, in which the residue lys-274 is involved in the formation of a covalent intermediate. in another study, yersinia  enterocolitica irp9, which is involved in the biosynthesis of the siderophore yersiniabactin, was for the first time biochemically characterized and shown to catalyse the formation of salicylate from chorismate via isochorismate as a reaction intermediate. a three-dimensional model for this enzyme was constructed  that will guide the search for potent inhibitors of salicylate formation, and hence of bacterial iron uptake.

TI  == salicylate biosynthesis: overexpression, purification, and characterization of irp9, a bifunctional salicylate synthase from yersinia enterocolitica.
AB  == in some bacteria, salicylate is synthesized using the enzymes isochorismate synthase and isochorismate pyruvate lyase. in contrast, gene inactivation and complementation experiments with yersinia enterocolitica suggest the synthesis of salicylate in the biosynthesis of the siderophore yersiniabactin involves a single protein, irp9, which converts chorismate directly into salicylate. in the  present study, irp9 was for the first time heterologously expressed in escherichia coli as a hexahistidine fusion protein, purified to near homogeneity, and characterized biochemically. the recombinant protein was found to be a dimer, each subunit of which has a molecular mass of 50 kda. enzyme assays, reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography and 1h nuclear magnetic resonance (nmr) spectroscopic analyses confirmed that irp9 is a salicylate synthase and converts chorismate to salicylate with a k(m) for chorismate of 4.2  microm and a k(cat) of 8 min(-1). the reaction was shown to proceed through the intermediate isochorismate, which was detected directly using 1h nmr spectroscopy.

TI  == dna methylation in yersinia enterocolitica: role of the dna adenine methyltransferase in mismatch repair and regulation of virulence factors.
AB  == dna adenine methyltransferase (dam) plays an important role in physiological processes of gram-negative bacteria such as mismatch repair and replication. in addition, dam regulates the expression of virulence genes in various species. the authors cloned the dam gene of yersinia enterocolitica and showed that dam is essential for viability. dam overproduction in y. enterocolitica resulted in an increased frequency of spontaneous mutation and decreased resistance to 2-aminopurine; however, these effects were only marginal compared to the effect of overproduction of escherichia coli-derived dam in y. enterocolitica, implying  different roles or activities of dam in mismatch repair of the two species. these differences in dam function are not the cause for the essentiality of dam in y. enterocolitica, as dam of e. coli can complement a dam defect in y. enterocolitica. instead, dam seems to interfere with expression of essential genes. furthermore, dam mediates virulence of y. enterocolitica. dam overproduction results in increased tissue culture invasion of y. enterocolitica, while the expression of specifically in vivo-expressed genes is not altered.

TI  == effects of varied ph, growth rate and temperature using controlled fermentation and batch culture on matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization whole cell protein fingerprints.
AB  == rapid identification of microorganisms using matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization (maldi) is a rapidly growing area of research due to the minimal sample preparation, speed of analysis and broad applicability of the technique. this approach relies on expressed biochemical markers, often proteins, to identify microorganisms. therefore, variations in culture conditions that affect protein expression may limit the ability of maldi-ms to correctly identify an organism. we have expanded our efforts to investigate the effects of culture conditions on maldi-ms signatures to specifically examine the effects of ph, growth rate and temperature. continuous cultures maintained in bioreactors were used to maintain specific growth rates and ph for e. coli hb 101. despite measurable morphological differences between growth conditions, the maldi-ms data associated each culture with the appropriate library entry (e. coli hb 101 generated using batch culture on a lb media), independent of ph or growth rate. the lone exception was for a biofilm sample collected from one of the reactors which had no appreciable degree of association with the correct library entry. within the data set for planktonic organisms, variations in growth rate created the largest variation between fingerprints. the effect of varying growth temperature on y. enterocolitica was also examined. while the anticipated effects on phenotype were observed, the maldi-ms technique provided the proper identification.

TI  == inv-mediated apoptosis of epithelial cells infected with enteropathogenic yersinia: a protective effect of lactoferrin.
AB  == yersinia spp., gram-negative bacteria infecting animals and humans, contain plasmid and chromosomal genes coding for different virulence factors, of which outer membrane proteins are the most important. among these, the inv gene product allows bacterial adherence and penetration of cells exposed at the intestinal lumen surface, and subsequent colonization of lymph nodes. in this research, we have studied the effects of bovine lactoferrin (blf) on y. enterocolitica and y.  pseudotuberculosis inv-mediated interactions with epithelial cells. in particular, we analyzed blf activity toward adhesion, invasion, and cell death induction by yersinia spp. and the escherichia coli hb101 (pri203) strain (expressing the cloned yersinia inv gene). results showed that blf was ineffective in bacterial adhesivity and invasivity whereas it inhibited apoptosis with a dose-dependent relationship. as epithelial cell apoptosis helps enteropathogenic yersinia to attack the host and to gain access to the tissue, our results demonstrate a new potential antimicrobial application for blf.

AB  == the yersinia enterocolitica prophage py54 replicates as a linear dna molecule with covalently closed ends. for replication of a circular py54 minimal replicon  that has been derived from a linear minireplicon, two phage-encoded loci are essential in escherichia coli: (i) the reading frame of the replication initiation gene repa and (ii) its 212-bp origin located within the 3' portion of  repa. the repa protein acts in trans on the origin since we have physically separated the py54 origin and repa onto a two-plasmid origin test system. for this trans action, the repa 3' end carrying the origin is dispensable. mutagenesis by alanine scan demonstrated that the motifs for primase and for nucleotide binding present in the protein are essential for repa activity. the replication initiation functions of repa are replicon specific. the replication initiation proteins dnaa, dnag, and dnab of the host are unable to promote origin replication in the presence of mutant repa proteins that carry single residue exchanges in these motifs. the proposed origins of the known related hairpin prophages py54, n15, and pko2 are all located toward the 3' end of the corresponding repa genes, where several structure elements are conserved. origin  function depends on the integrity of these elements.

TI  == bioinformatics analysis of the locus for enterocyte effacement provides novel insights into type-iii secretion.
AB  == background: like many other pathogens, enterohaemorrhagic and enteropathogenic strains of escherichia coli employ a type-iii secretion system to translocate bacterial effector proteins into host cells, where they then disrupt a range of cellular functions. this system is encoded by the locus for enterocyte effacement. many of the genes within this locus have been assigned names and functions through homology with the better characterised ysc-yop system from yersinia spp. however, the functions and homologies of many lee genes remain obscure. results: we have performed a fresh bioinformatics analysis of the lee. using psi-blast we have been able to identify several novel homologies between lee-encoded and ysc-yop-associated proteins: orf2/ysce, orf5/yscl, rorf8/esci, sepq/yscq, sepl/yopn-tyea, cesd2/lcrr. in addition, we highlight homology between espa and flagellin, and report many new homologues of the chaperone cest. conclusion: we conclude that the vast majority of lee-encoded proteins do indeed  possess homologues and that homology data can be used in combination with experimental data to make fresh functional predictions.

AB  == spectroscopic fingerprints of bacteria were investigated by fourier transform infrared (ftir) microspectroscopy for the elucidation of chemical composition and structural information during growth. good differentiation of six microorganisms  was achieved down to the strain level. the inherent compositional and structural  differences of cell envelopes and cytoplasm were investigated and utilized to obtain more detailed analysis of the spectroscopic features. bands or regions of  key functional groups were also identified in the original spectra. microspectroscopic monitoring of bacterial growth demonstrated that ftir spectroscopy cannot only provide molecular fingerprints of the cell envelope, but also compositional and metabolic information of the cytoplasm under different physiological conditions. this approach could be an effective alternative to traditional nutritional and biochemical methods to monitor and assess the effects of inhibitors and other environmental factors on microbial cell growth.

TI  == nonessential genes of phage phiyeo3-12 include genes involved in adaptation to growth on yersinia enterocolitica serotype o:3.
AB  == bacteriophage phiyeo3-12 is a t7/t3-related lytic phage that naturally infects yersinia enterocolitica serotype o:3 strains by using the lipopolysaccharide o polysaccharide (o antigen) as its receptor. the phage genome is a 39,600-bp-long  linear, double-stranded dna molecule that contains 58 genes. the roles of many of the genes are currently unknown. to identify nonessential genes, the isolated phage dna was subjected to mua transposase-catalyzed in vitro transposon insertion mutagenesis with a lacz' gene-containing reporter transposon. following electroporation into escherichia coli dh10b and subsequent infection of e. coli jm109/pay100, a strain that expresses the y. enterocolitica o:3 o antigen on its  surface, mutant phage clones were identified by their beta-galactosidase activity, manifested as a blue color on indicator plates. transposon insertions were mapped in a total of 11 genes located in the early and middle regions of the phage genome. all of the mutants had efficiencies of plating (eops) and fitnesses identical to those of the wild-type phage when grown on e. coli jm109/pay100. however, certain mutants exhibited altered phenotypes when grown on y. enterocolitica o:3. transposon insertions in genes 0.3 to 0.7 decreased the eop on y. enterocolitica o:3, while the corresponding deletions did not, suggesting that the low eop was not caused by inactivation of the genes per se. instead, it  was shown that in these mutants the low eop was due to the delayed expression of  gene 1, coding for rna polymerase. on the other hand, inactivation of gene 1.3 or 3.5 by either transposon insertion or deletion decreased phage fitness when grown on y. enterocolitica. these results indicate that phiyeo3-12 has adapted to utilize y. enterocolitica as its host and that these adaptations include the products of genes 1.3 and 3.5, dna ligase and lysozyme, respectively.

AB  == matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms) has been used to identify bacteria based upon protein signatures.  this research shows that while some different proteins are produced by vegetative bacteria when they are cultured in different growth media, positive identification with maldi-tof ms is still possible with the protocol established  at the pacific northwest national laboratory (k. h. jarman, s. t. cebula, a. j. saenz, c. e. petersen, n. b. valentine, m. t. kingsley, and k. l. wahl, anal. chem. 72:1217-1223, 2000). a core set of small proteins remain constant under at  least four different culture media conditions and blood agar plates, including minimal medium m9, rich media, tryptic soy broth (tsb) or luria-bertani (lb) broth, and blood agar plates, such that analysis of the intact cells by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry allows for consistent identification.

TI  == yersinia enterocolitica adhesin a induces production of interleukin-8 in epithelial cells.
AB  == the major invasive factor of yersinia enterocolitica, the invasin (inv) protein,  induces proinflammatory host cell responses, including interleukin-8 (il-8) secretion from human epithelial cells, by engagement of beta1 integrins. the inv-triggered beta1 integrin signaling involves the small gtpase rac; the activation of map kinases, such as p38, mek1, and jnk; and the activation of the  transcription factor nf-kappab. in the present study, we demonstrate that y. enterocolitica yada, which is a major adhesin of y. enterocolitica with pleiotropic virulence effects, induces il-8 secretion in epithelial cells. the abilities of yada and inv to promote adhesion to and invasion of hela cells and to induce il-8 production by the cells were investigated by expression of yada and inv in escherichia coli. while yada mediates efficacious adhesion to hela cells, it mediates marginal invasion compared with inv. both yada and inv trigger comparable levels of il-8 production. conformational changes of the yada head domain by mutation of nsvaig-s motifs, which abolish collagen binding, also abolish adhesion of yersinia to hela cells and yada-mediated il-8 secretion. furthermore, experiments in which blocking antibodies against beta1 integrins were used demonstrate that beta1 integrins are crucial for yada-mediated il-8 secretion. inhibitor studies demonstrate the involvement of small gtpases and map kinases, such as p38, mek1, and jnk, indicating that beta1 integrin-dependent signaling mediated by inv or yada involves similar signaling pathways. these data present yada, in addition to inv, yopb, and yersinia lipopolysaccharide, as a further inducer of proinflammatory molecules by which y. enterocolitica might promote inflammatory tissue reactions.

TI  == comparative genomics of the kdgr regulon in erwinia chrysanthemi 3937 and other gamma-proteobacteria.
AB  == in the plant-pathogenic enterobacterium erwinia chrysanthemi, almost all known genes involved in pectin catabolism are controlled by the transcriptional regulator kdgr. in this study, the comparative genomics approach was used to analyse the kdgr regulon in completely sequenced genomes of eight enterobacteria, including erw. chrysanthemi, and two vibrio species. application of a signal recognition procedure complemented by operon structure and protein sequence analysis allowed identification of new candidate genes of the kdgr regulon. most  of these genes were found to be controlled by the camp-receptor protein, a global regulator of catabolic genes. at the next step, regulation of these genes in erw. chrysanthemi was experimentally verified using in vivo transcriptional fusions and an attempt was made to clarify the functional role of the predicted genes in  pectin catabolism. interestingly, it was found that the kdgr protein, previously  known as a repressor, positively regulates expression of two new members of the regulon, phosphoenolpyruvate synthase gene ppsa and an adjacent gene, ydia, of unknown function. other predicted regulon members, namely chmx, dhfx, gntb, pykf, spix, sota, tpfx, yeeo and yjgk, were found to be subject to classical negative regulation by kdgr. possible roles of newly identified members of the erw. chrysanthemi kdgr regulon, chmx, dhfx, gntdbmnac, spix, tpfx, ydia, yeeo, ygjv and yjgk, in pectin catabolism are discussed. finally, complete reconstruction of the kdgr regulons in various gamma-proteobacteria yielded a metabolic map reflecting a globally conserved pathway for the catabolism of pectin and its derivatives with variability in transport and enzymic capabilities among species. in particular, possible non-orthologous substitutes of isomerase kdui and a new oligogalacturonide transporter in the vibrio species were detected.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance profile of five major food-borne pathogens isolated from beef, pork and poultry.
AB  == this study was performed to evaluate the resistance rate against antimicrobials of food isolates of the five major food-borne pathogens to compare these and to possibly distinguish a pattern. a total of 922 samples of the major meat species  (pork, beef and poultry) were analysed for thermophilic campylobacter, salmonella, yersinia enterocolitica, pathogenic escherichia coli and listeria monocytogenes. isolates were subjected to antimicrobial resistance testing by the disc diffusion method. roughly the same overall rate of resistance was identified for thermophilic campylobacter, salmonella and pathogenic e. coli. resistance to  quinolones and tetracycline was determined most frequently. in contrast, food isolates of y. enterocolitica and l. monocytogenes were rarely tested resistant.  the significance of our findings is that resistance rates in enteric bacteria seem to be much higher than in pathogens found in a variety of environments, closely associated to the host environment.

AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of gene recombination technique using the pet-30 ek/lic expression vector for production a 36 kda released protein called yopd and evaluate of this purified protein as antigen in  serodiagnosis of yersiniosis. protein yopd of y. enterocolitica was expressing in escherichia coli bl21 (de3) using the pet-30 ek/lic expression vector. purification of the expressed enzyme from suspensions of e. coli cells treated with bug buster protein/extraction reagent was accomplished by immobilised metal  (ni2+) affinity column chromatography (his-trap). the igm, igg and iga class antibodies to yopd were measured in 100 serum samples collected from patients suspected for yersiniosis and 100 blood donors. the obtained results were compared to the results of elisa with released proteins isolated from the culture of y. enterocolitica supernatant under calcium deficient conditions and commercial elisa with recombinant released proteins. a very high (94.0-100.0%) specificity and good sensitivity (55.2-80.4%) were displayed by the elisa with yopd in relation to other two elisa. the results of our study showed that recombinant yopd protein purified by chromatography of bio-affinity may be used in serodiagnosis of yersiniosis as a high specific antigen free of yersinia lipopolysaccharides.

TI  == photochemical treatment of platelet concentrates with amotosalen and long-wavelength ultraviolet light inactivates a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == background: bacterial contamination of platelet (plt) concentrates can result in  transfusion-transmitted sepsis. a photochemical treatment (pct) process with amotosalen hcl and long-wavelength ultraviolet light (uva), which cross-links nucleic acids, was developed to inactivate bacteria and other pathogens in plt concentrates. study design and methods: high titers of pathogenic aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive bacteria (10 species), aerobic gram-negative bacteria (7  species), and spirochetes (2 species) were added to single-donor plt concentrates containing 3.0 x 10(11) to 6.0 x 10(11) plts in approximately 300 ml of 35 percent plasma and 65 percent plt additive solution (intersol, baxter healthcare) or saline. after pct with 150 micro mol per l amotosalen and 3 j per cm(2) uva, residual bacterial levels were detected by sensitive microbiologic methods. results: the level of inactivation of viable bacteria was expressed as log reduction. log reduction of gram-positive bacteria for staphylococcus epidermidis was > 6.6; for staphylococcus aureus, 6.6; for streptococcus pyogenes, > 6.8; for listeria monocytogenes, > 6.3; for corynebacterium minutissimum, > 6.3; for bacillus cereus (vegetative), > 5.5; for lactobacillus sp., > 6.4; for bifidobacterium adolescentis, > 6.0; for propionibacterium acnes, > 6.2; and for  clostridium perfringens, > 6.5. log reduction of gram-negative bacteria for escherichia coli was > 6.4; for serratia marcescens, > 6.7; for klebsiella pneumoniae, > 5.6; for pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4.5; for salmonella choleraesuis,  > 6.2; for yersinia enterocolitica, > 5.9; and for enterobacter cloacae, 5.9. log reduction of spirochetes for treponema pallidum was 6.8 to 7.0, and for borrelia  burgdorferi, > 6.9. conclusion: pct inactivates high levels of a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria. the inactivation of bacteria in plt concentrates offers the potential to prospectively prevent plt-transfusion-associated bacteremia.

TI  == interaction of endotoxins with toll-like receptor 4 correlates with their endotoxic potential and may explain the proinflammatory effect of brucella spp. lps.
AB  == endotoxins displaying differences in the chemical structure of their lipid a were used to induce the expression of chemokines in the human monocytic thp-1 cell line. lps from two enterobacterial species such as escherichia coli and yersinia  enterocolitica induced mrna expression of ifn-gamma-inducible protein (ip)-10, macrophage-inflammatory protein (mip)-1alpha, mip-1beta, monocyte chemoattractant protein (mcp)-1 and il-8. lps from the non-enterobacterial genera brucella and ochrobactrum induced the expression of these chemokines to a lower extent. attempts to address the signaling routes involved in these responses were carried out in transiently transfected hek293 cells. induction of kappab-driven transcriptional activity by enterobacterial lps was observed in cells transfected with tlr-4 alone, although co-transfection of tlr-4, md-2 and cd14 provided optimal induction. the response to brucella spp. and ochrobactrum anthropi lps was only significant at the concentration of 10 microg/ml. these data indicate that lps from brucella spp. and o. anthropi, which contain lipid a moieties with  structural features different from those of enterobacteriaceae elicit biochemical signaling via tlr-4 only at high concentrations. neither tlr-1, tlr-2 and tlr-6 nor heterodimeric combinations of these receptor molecules are involved. conversely, the ability of lps to activate the tlr-4 route is a reliable molecular biomarker for endotoxicity.

TI  == structure of the yersinia pestis type iii secretion chaperone sych in complex with a stable fragment of yscm2.
AB  == pathogenic yersinia species use a type iii secretion system to inject cytotoxic effector proteins directly into the cytosol of mammalian cells, where they neutralize the innate immune response by interfering with the signal-transduction pathways that control phagocytosis and inflammation. to be exported efficiently,  some effectors must transiently associate with cognate cytoplasmic secretion chaperones. sych is the chaperone for yoph, a potent eukaryotic-like protein tyrosine phosphatase that is essential for virulence. sych also binds two negative regulators of type iii secretion, yscm1 and yscm2, both of which share significant sequence homology with the chaperone-binding domain of yoph. here, the structure of a complex between sych and a stable fragment of yscm2 that was designed on the basis of limited proteolysis experiments is presented. the overall fold of sych is very similar to the structures of other homodimeric secretion chaperones that have been determined to date. yscm2 wraps around sych in an extended fashion, with some secondary but no tertiary structure, assuming a conformation distinct from the globular fold that it is predicted to adopt in the absence of sych.

TI  == application of oligonucleotide array technology for the rapid detection of pathogenic bacteria of foodborne infections.
AB  == a rapid and accurate method for detection for common pathogenic bacteria in foodborne infections was established by using oligonucleotide array technology. nylon membrane was used as the array support. a mutation region of the 23s rrna gene was selected as the discrimination target from 14 species (genera) of bacteria causing foodborne infections and two unrelated bacterial species. a pair of universal primers was designed for pcr amplification of the 23s rrna gene. twenty-one species (genera)-specific oligonucleotide detection probes were synthesized and spotted onto the nylon membranes. the 23s rrna gene amplification products of 14 species of pathogenic bacteria were hybridized to the oligonucleotide array. hybridization results were analyzed with digoxigenin-linked enzyme reaction. results indicated that nine species of pathogenic bacteria (escherichia coli, campylobacter jejuni, shigella dysenteriae, vibrio cholerae, vibrio parahaemolyticus, proteus vulgaris, bacillus cereus, listeria monocytogenes and clostridium botulinum) showed high sensitivity and specificity for the oligonucleotide array. two other species (salmonella enterica and yersinia enterocolitica) gave weak cross-reaction with e. coli, but  the reaction did not affect their detection. after redesigning the probes, positive hybridization results were obtained with staphylococcus aureus, but not  with clostridium perfringens and streptococcus pyogenes. the oligonucleotide array can also be applied to samples collected in clinical settings of foodborne  infections. the superiority of oligonucleotide array over other tests lies on its rapidity, accuracy and efficiency in the diagnosis, treatment and control of foodborne infections.

TI  == expression and distribution of beta1 integrins in in vitro-induced m cells: implications for yersinia adhesion to peyer's patch epithelium.
AB  == beta1 integrins are anchored on the basal membrane of enterocytes, but little is  known about their localization in m cells, which are the main entry route into the intestinal mucosa for many bacterial pathogens. in particular, it has been suggested that adhesion of enteropathogenic yersinia to m cells is mediated by interaction of the bacterial protein invasin and apical beta1 integrins. using a  novel in vitro model of m cells, we demonstrate an augmented apical and basolateral targeting of beta1 integrins in m cells associated with increased total alpha chain synthesis. the alpha3 and alpha6 subunits were targeted to the  basal pole, but alpha2 subunit was targeted at both poles. no other alpha subunit was found associated with apical beta1 integrins on m cells. interestingly, y. enterocolitica still adhered to the apical surface of m cells, despite the fact that alpha2beta1 is not a receptor for invasin. we therefore studied the adhesive properties of invasin-mutant y. enterocolitica and invasin-expressing escherichia coli on the apical surface of m cells. we show that it is not invasin, but the product of an as yet unidentified bacterial chromosomal gene, that is involved in the adhesion of y. enterocolitica to the apical membrane of m cells.

TI  == gene array analysis of yersinia enterocolitica flhd and flhc: regulation of enzymes affecting synthesis and degradation of carbamoylphosphate.
AB  == this paper focuses on global gene regulation by flhd/flhc in enteric bacteria. even though yersinia enterocolitica flhd/flhc can complement an escherichia coli  flhdc mutant for motility, it is not known if the y. enterocolitica flhd/flhc complex has an effect on metabolism similar to e. coli. to study metabolic gene regulation, a partial yersinia enterocolitica 8081c microarray was constructed and the expression patterns of wild-type cells were compared to an flhdc mutant strain at 25 and 37 degrees c. the overlap between the e. coli and y. enterocolitica flhd/flhc regulated genes was 25 %. genes that were regulated at least fivefold by flhd/flhc in y. enterocolitica are genes encoding urocanate hydratase (hutu), imidazolone propionase (huti), carbamoylphosphate synthetase (carab) and aspartate carbamoyltransferase (pyrbi). these enzymes are part of a pathway that is involved in the degradation of l-histidine to l-glutamate and eventually leads into purine/pyrimidine biosynthesis via carbamoylphosphate and carbamoylaspartate. a number of other genes were regulated at a lower rate. in two additional experiments, the expression of wild-type cells grown at 4 or 25 degrees c was compared to the same strain grown at 37 degrees c. the expression of the flagella master operon flhd was not affected by temperature, whereas the flagella-specific sigma factor flia was highly expressed at 25 degrees c and reduced at 4 and 37 degrees c. several other flagella genes, all of which are under the control of flia, exhibited a similar temperature profile. these data are consistent with the hypothesis that temperature regulation of flagella genes  might be mediated by the flagella-specific sigma factor flia and not the flagella master regulator flhd/flhc.

AB  == the majority of virulence factors including the 12 yersinia outer membrane proteins (yops), 29 yop secretion proteins (ysc) and few specific yop chaperone (syc) are contributed by the 70 kb lcr middle plasmid of yersinia pestis. yersinia pestis isolates recovered during 1994 plague outbreak and rodent surveillance samples of southern states of india were studied for the presence of important yops by the conventional procedure of partially purifying outer membrane proteins (omps) after cultivation in calcium deficient media. prominent  bands numbering 4-5 between 34-42 kda region corresponding to important yops were seen in all the isolates as well as in other yersinia and non-yersinia species by sds-page. western blotting with the polyclonal antisera raised against these omp  preparations revealed few immuno-reactive bands that appeared to be shared among  y. pestis, y. pseudotruberculosis, y. enterocolitica, y. fredrocksenii, y. intermedia, y. kristensenii and e. coli. three recombinant yop proteins namely, yopm, yopb and lcrv were produced and antisera to these proteins could reveal presence of these yops in the y. pestis omp preparations. in order to further characterize the important yops among omps, attempts were made to generate monoclonal antibodies against omp preparation. three of the 4 stable reactive clones that were obtained, when tested, had extensive cross-reactions among pathogenic yersinia species, y. pestis and y. pseudotuberculosis isolates, other  yersinia species and the members of enterobacteriaceae in dot-elisa and western blotting. one of the monoclonal antibodies, yp1, exhibited reaction to all the pathogenic yersinia species and the isolates, with restricted cross-reactivity to y. intermedia, y. kristensenii, k. pneumoniae. none of the 4 monoclonal antibodies had reactions with the 3 recombinant yop proteins. it appears that under low calcium response, the y. pestis not only activates secretion of yops but also a large number of other proteins, which as per the present observations  are cross-reactive within the family enterobacteriaceae.

TI  == regulation of the ysa type iii secretion system of yersinia enterocolitica by ysae/sycb and ysrs/ysrr.
AB  == yersinia enterocolitica biovar 1b contains two type iii secretion systems (ttsss), the plasmid-encoded ysc-yop system and the chromosomally encoded ysa-ysp system. proteins secreted from the ysa ttss (ysps) have only been detected in vitro when cells are cultured at 26 degrees c in a high-nacl medium. however, the exact role of the ysa ttss is unclear. thus, investigations into the regulation of this system may help elucidate the role of the ysps during the life cycle of y. enterocolitica. here we present evidence that the arac-like regulator ysae acts together with the chaperone sycb to regulate transcription of the sycbyspbcda operon, a phenomenon similar to that seen in the closely related salmonella spi-1 and shigella flexneri mxi-spa-ipa ttsss. deletion of either sycb or ysae results in a twofold reduction in the activity of a sycb-lacz fusion compared to the wild type. in a reconstituted escherichia coli system, transcription of sycb was activated sixfold only when both ysae and sycb were present, demonstrating that they are necessary for activation. ysrr and ysrs are  located near the ysa genes and encode a putative two-component regulatory system. mutations in either gene indicated that both ysrr and ysrs were required for secretion of ysps. in addition, transcription from sycb-lacz and ysae-lacz fusions was decreased 6.5- and 25-fold, respectively, in the ysrs mutant compared to the wild type. furthermore, in the absence of nacl, the activity of ysae-lacz  was reduced 25-fold in the wild-type and deltaysrs strains, indicating that ysrs  is probably required for the salt-dependent expression of the ysa locus. these results suggest that the putative two-component system ysrrs may be a key element in the regulatory cascade for the ysa ttss.

TI  == sensitization of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria to jenseniin g by sublethal injury.
AB  == jenseniin g, a bacteriocin produced by propionibacterium thoenii p126, is active  against related propionibacteria and some lactic acid bacteria and is sporostatic to botulinal spores. the objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of sublethal stress on jenseniin g activity. bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella typhimurium, shigella flexneri, staphylococcus aureus, and yersinia enterocolitica were subjected to temperature, acid, and osmotic stresses in the presence of jenseniin g. the bacteriocin reduced the viability of sublethally injured cultures, although the extent of reduction varied with strain and treatment. e. faecalis was the most sensitive to temperature stress; no reduction of viable counts occurred in the absence of jenseniin g, and a 1.5-log reduction occurred in the presence of jenseniin g. b. cereus, l. monocytogenes, and s. aureus were more sensitive to jenseniin g when exposed to heat stress than when exposed to cold stress, whereas e. coli, salmonella typhimurium, and s. flexneri were more sensitive to jenseniin g when exposed to cold stress than when exposed to heat stress. when comparing an acid stress test alone to a combination of acid stress and jenseniin g, e. faecalis and l. monocytogenes showed the greatest sensitivities with 4.87- and 2.82-log reductions, respectively, after 7 days. all cultures except for s. aureus were adversely affected by the combination of salt stress and jenseniin g. salmonella typhimurium showed the greatest sensitivity to salt stress with jenseniin g (a 1.54-log reduction at day 7) when compared to salt stress alone (a 0.55-log reduction at day 7). jenseniin g, like bacteriocins produced by other gram-positive species, has broader activity against stressed organisms.

AB  == sera from cattle naturally infected with brucella abortus (n = 160), vaccinated with b. abortus s19 (n = 88) or immunized with yersinia enterocolitica o:9 (n = 25) or escherichia coli o157:h7 (n = 80) were collected. the sera were compared for antibody content to the same bacteria by indirect enzyme immunoassay (ielisa), fluorescence polarization assay (fpa) and competitive enzyme immunoassay (celisa). cattle sera (n = 523) collected randomly from across canada were tested in the same tests. sera from the b. abortus infected group reacted positively in the brucellosis ielisa (ielisa(br)), celisa and fpa (fpa(br)) and the y. enterocolitica ielisa (ielisa(ye)) while the y. enterocolitica fpa (fpa(ye)) detected antibody in 93.8% and the e. coli ielisa (ielisa(ec)) 86.9% and the e. coli fpa (fpa(ec)) 48.1%. about 70% of the sera from b. abortus s19 vaccinated animals reacted in the three ielisas, 45% in the celisa, and 37.7% in  the fpa(ec), 21.6% in the fpa(br) and 5.7% in the fpa(ye). sera from e. coli o:157 exposed cattle reacted mainly in the ielisa(ec) and fpa(ec) although surprisingly 87.5% reacted in the ielisa(ye) and only 3.8% in the ielisa(br). no  reactions were observed with these sera in the fpa(br) and fpa(ye) but one serum  gave a low positive reaction in the celisa. all sera from y. enterocolitica o:9 exposed cattle reacted in the ielisa(br) and ielisa(ye) and 80% in the ielisa(ec). in the celisa, 44% gave a positive reaction and 64% were positive in  the fpa(br), 28% in the fpa(ye) and 12% in the fpa(ec). of the 523 canadian sera, about 50% reacted in the e. coli tests with only minor reactions in the y. enterocolitica o:9 and b. abortus assays. from the data, the cross reaction between e. coli o157:h7, y. enterocilitica o:9 and b. abortus is dependent on the test used. thus, extensive cross reaction was observed with the ielisa with much  less reactivity in the fpa and the celisa.

TI  == yersinia enterocolitica type iii secretion chaperone sych. recombinant expression, purification, characterisation, and crystallisation.
AB  == all pathogenic yersinia species (y. enterocolitica, y. pestis, and y. pseudotuberculosis) share a type three secretion system (ttss) that allows translocation of effector proteins into host cells. yersinia enterocolitica sych  is a chaperone assisting the transport of the effector yoph and two regulatory components of the ttss, yscm1 and yscm2. we have recombinantly expressed sych in  escherichia coli. purification of tag-free sych to near homogeneity was achieved  by combining ammonium sulfate precipitation, anion exchange chromatography, and gel filtration. functionality of purified sych was proven by demonstrating binding to yoph. sych crystals were grown that diffracted to 2.94a resolution. preliminary crystallographic data and biochemical findings suggest that sych forms homotetramers. sych may therefore represent a novel class of ttss chaperones. in addition, we found that yoph was enzymatically active in the presence of sych. this implies that the function of the secretion chaperone sych  is not to keep yoph in a globally unfolded state prior to secretion.

TI  == preliminary foodnet data on the incidence of infection with pathogens transmitted commonly through food--selected sites, united states, 2003.
AB  == in the united states, an estimated 76 million persons contract foodborne and other acute diarrheal illnesses each year. cdc's emerging infections program foodborne diseases active surveillance network (foodnet) collects data on diseases caused by enteric pathogens transmitted commonly through food in nine u.s. sites. foodnet quantifies and monitors the incidence of these infections by  conducting active surveillance for laboratory-diagnosed illness. this report describes preliminary surveillance data for 2003 and compares them with 1996-2002 data. the data indicate substantial declines in the incidence of infections caused by campylobacter, cryptosporidium parvum, escherichia coli o157, salmonella, and yersinia enterocolitica. these data represent progress toward meeting the 2010 national health objectives of reducing the incidence of foodborne infections (objective nos. 10.1a, 10.1b, and 10.1d). however, increased efforts are needed to reduce further the incidence of foodborne illnesses, particularly among children.

TI  == effect of bovine lactoferricin on enteropathogenic yersinia adhesion and invasion in hep-2 cells.
AB  == bovine lactoferricin, a pepsin-generated antimicrobial peptide from bovine lactoferrin active against a wide range of bacteria, was tested for its ability to influence the adhesion and invasion of yersinia enterocolitica and yersinia pseudotuberculosis in hep-2 cells. the addition of non-cytotoxic and non-bactericidal concentrations of lactoferricin to cell monolayers before infection, under different bacterial growth experimental conditions, was ineffective or resulted in about a 10-fold increase in bacterial adhesion, whereas, in bacteria grown in conditions allowing maximal inv gene expression, a  10-fold inhibition of cell invasion by lactoferricin was observed. to confirm that the anti-invasive activity of lactoferricin was exerted against invasin-mediated bacterial entry, experiments were also performed utilizing escherichia coli strain hb101 (pri203), harbouring the inv gene from y. pseudotuberculosis, which allows penetration of mammalian cells. under these experimental conditions, lactoferricin was able to inhibit bacterial entry into epithelial cells, demonstrating that this peptide acts on inv-mediated yersinia species invasion. as the inv gene product is the most important virulence factor  in enteropathogenic yersinia, being responsible for bacterial adherence and penetration within epithelial cells of the intestinal lumen and for the subsequent colonization of regional lymph nodes, these data provide additional information on the protective role of lactoferricin against bacterial infection.

TI  == highly divergent rfah orthologs from pathogenic proteobacteria can substitute for escherichia coli rfah both in vivo and in vitro.
AB  == the transcriptional enhancer protein rfah positively regulates production of virulence factors in escherichia coli and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium via a cis element, ops. genes coding for rfah orthologs were identified in conceptually translated genomes of bacterial pathogens, including vibrio and yersinia spp. we cloned the rfah genes from vibrio cholerae, yersinia enterocolitica, s. enterica serovar typhimurium, and klebsiella pneumoniae into e. coli expression vectors. purified rfah orthologs, including the most divergent one from v. cholerae, were readily recruited to the e. coli transcription elongation complex. postrecruitment stimulation of transcript elongation appeared to vary with the degree of similarity to e. coli rfah. v. cholerae rfah was particularly defective in reducing downstream pausing and termination; this defect was substantially alleviated by an increase in its concentration. when overexpressed episomally, all of the rfah genes complemented the disruption of the chromosomal copy of the e. coli gene. thus, despite the apparently accelerated divergent evolution of the rfah proteins, the mechanism of their action is conserved well enough to make them transcriptionally active in the e. coli system.

TI  == bdellovibrio bacteriovorus strains produce a novel major outer membrane protein during predacious growth in the periplasm of prey bacteria.
AB  == bdellovibrio bacteriovorus is a predatory bacterium that is capable of invading a number of gram-negative bacteria. the life cycle of this predator can be divided  into a nonreproductive phase outside the prey bacteria and a multiplication phase in their periplasm. it was suggested that during the reproduction phase, b. bacteriovorus reutilizes unmodified components of the prey's cell wall. we therefore examined the outer membranes of b. bacteriovorus strains hd100 (dsm 50701) and hd114 (dsm 50705) by using escherichia coli, yersinia enterocolitica,  and pseudomonas putida as prey organisms. the combined sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometric analyses revealed novel and innate major outer membrane proteins (omps) of b. bacteriovorus strains. an incorporation of prey-derived proteins into the cell wall of b. bacteriovorus was not observed. the corresponding genes of the b. bacteriovorus strains were elucidated by a reverse-genetics approach, and a leader peptide was deduced from the gene sequence and confirmed by edman degradation. the host-independent mutant strain b. bacteriovorus hi100 (dsm 12732) growing in the absence of prey organisms possesses an omp similar to the major omps of the host-dependent strains. the similarity of the primary structure of the omps produced by the three bdellovibrio strains is between 67 and 89%. the leader peptides of all omps have a length of 20 amino acids and are highly conserved. the molecular sizes of the mature proteins range from 34.9 to 37.6 kda. secondary-structure predictions indicate preferential alpha-helices and little beta-barrel structures.

TI  == emerging food pathogens and bacterial toxins.
AB  == many different foodborne diseases have been described. for example, shigella bacteria, hepatitis a virus and norwalk virus were shown as a unwashed hands microorganisms, but pathogen campylobacter and escherichia coli were named as raw and undercooked meat and poultry or raw milk and untreated water born bacteria. however, two of them: listeria monocytogenes and yersinia enterocolitica are known as growing at refrigerator temperatures. essential virulence determinants of listeria monocytogenes pathogenicity are well known as a bacterial toxins. basic molecular mechanisms of pathogenicity depending from these toxins were presented. it was shown that other bacterial toxins may act as very danger food poisoning substances. this is why elimination of pathogenic microorganisms from foods is an obvious solution in some food processes, however this approach is not practical or even desirable in many processes. thus, risk assessment and microbial monitoring will continue to play important roles in ensuring food safety. some technological advances have the capability of delivering detection systems that can not only monitor pathogenic microorganisms, but also entire microbial populations in the food matrix.

TI  == the probiotic escherichia coli strain nissle 1917 interferes with invasion of human intestinal epithelial cells by different enteroinvasive bacterial pathogens.
AB  == the probiotic escherichia coli strain nissle 1917 (mutaflor) of serotype o6:k5:h1 was reported to protect gnotobiotic piglets from infection with salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium. an important virulence property of salmonella is invasion of host epithelial cells. therefore, we tested for interference of e. coli strain nissle 1917 with salmonella invasion of int407 cells. simultaneous administration of e. coli strain nissle 1917 and salmonella resulted in up to 70% reduction of salmonella invasion efficiency. furthermore, invasion of yersinia enterocolitica, shigella flexneri, legionella pneumophila and even of listeria monocytogenes were inhibited by the probiotic e. coli strain nissle 1917 without  affecting the viability of the invasive bacteria. the observed inhibition of invasion was not due to the production of microcins by the nissle 1917 strain because its isogenic microcin-negative mutant sk22d was as effective as the parent strain. reduced invasion rates were also achieved if strain nissle 1917 was separated from the invasive bacteria as well as from the int407 monolayer by  a membrane non-permeable for bacteria. we conclude e. coli nissle 1917 to interfere with bacterial invasion of int407 cells via a secreted component and not relying on direct physical contact with either the invasive bacteria or the epithelial cells.

TI  == regulation of htra expression in yersinia enterocolitica.
AB  == in escherichia coli, envelope stress is regulated by the alternative sigma factor sigma(e) and the two-component regulatory system cpxra. both systems overlap in the transcriptional regulation of the htra gene encoding a protease that degrades misfolded proteins in the periplasm. in yersinia enterocolitica, htra is important for intracellular survival and full virulence in animal models. here we show that regulation of htra expression in y. enterocolitica is dependent on cpxr and putatively also on rpoe. however, the stimuli inducing both systems were different from e. coli. most strikingly, we found that overproduction of an outer membrane protein, a typical stimulus for the induction of htra expression via rpoe in e. coli, led to the induction of htra expression via the cpx system in y. enterocolitica. interestingly, a y. enterocolitica cpxr mutant strain was not impaired for virulence in a mouse model of infection.

TI  == a novel integrative and conjugative element (ice) of escherichia coli: the putative progenitor of the yersinia high-pathogenicity island.
AB  == diversification of bacterial species and pathotypes is largely caused by horizontal transfer of diverse dna elements such as plasmids, phages and genomic  islands (e.g. pathogenicity islands, pais). a pai called high-pathogenicity island (hpi) carrying genes involved in siderophore-mediated iron acquisition (yersiniabactin system) has previously been identified in yersinia pestis, y. pseudotuberculosis and y. enterocolitica ib strains, and has been characterized as an essential virulence factor in these species. strikingly, an orthologous hpi is a widely distributed virulence determinant among escherichia coli and other enterobacteriaceae which cause extraintestinal infections. here we report on the  hpi of e. coli strain ecor31 which is distinct from all other hpis described to date because the ecor31 hpi comprises an additional 35 kb fragment at the right border compared to the hpi of other e. coli and yersinia species. this part encodes for both a functional mating pair formation system and a dna-processing region related to plasmid clodf13 of enterobacter cloacae. upon induction of the  p4-like integrase, the entire hpi of ecor31 is precisely excised and circularised. the hpi of ecor31 presented here resembles integrative and conjugative elements termed ice. it may represent the progenitor of the hpi found in y. pestis and e. coli, revealing a missing link in the horizontal transfer of  an element that contributes to microbial pathogenicity upon acquisition.

AB  == objectives: to observe the occurrence of different etiological agents of acute diarrhea (ad) in stool specimens of patients and children in a control group. material and methods: 100 children less than three years of age with ad were studied as well as 100 controls, between november 1993 and may 1994. stool specimens were collected in both groups and the following enteropathogens were searched for: rotavirus, escherichia coli (epec, etec, eiec, ehec), salmonella sp, shigella sp, campylobacter jejuni, campylobacter coli, yersinia enterocolitica, cryptosporidium sp, giardia lamblia, entamoeba histolytica. statistical analysis using the exact fisher test (at significance level p<0,05) was done. the mean age was 12,5 months, with more cases in patients less than 6 months (35%). children were seen at the emergency section on an average fifth day after the start of the diarrhea. most came from homes with basical sanitary conditions. watery diarrhea was more frequent than bloody diarrhea with mucus, at a proportion of 4:1. results: rotavirus was the most frequent agent: 21% in the ad group and 3% in the control group (p= 0,0001). shigella sp was isolated in 7%  of the ad group and none of the control group (p= 0,0140). epec was detected in 13% of ad cases and 7% in the control group (p= 0,2381) but the classical subgroups o55, o111, o119 were only isolated from the patients with ad. the other enteropathogens were infrequently detected or in equal proportion in both groups. rotavirus and epec were the more frequently isolated agents in watery diarrhea, while shigella sp was the predominant agent found in bloody stools with mucus. conclusions: rotavirus was the most common causative agent in ad. the detection of rotavirus and shigella sp nearly exclusively in patients with ad confirms the  high patogenicity of these etiological agents when compared to the others. escherichia coli (epec) diagnosed by polyvalent sera does not confirm its respective diarrheogenic property due to isolation in the same proportion among patients with ad and controls. monovalent antisera made possible the detection of classical subgroups of epec o111, o119, o55 isolated only from ad patients, confirming the already known high patogenicity of these strains.

AB  == at the turn of the 20th century, typhoid fever was common in wisconsin, and was a major impetus for the establishment of the wisconsin state laboratory of hygiene  (wslh) in 1903. by the 1940s, typhoid was virtually eliminated in the united states due to public health measures such as disinfection of drinking water, sewage treatment, pasteurization, and shellfish bed sanitation. however, new food and waterborne pathogens have emerged to take the place of salmonella typhi. infections with non-typhoidal salmonella strains in the united states have increased almost 10-fold since the 1950s. in the last 20 years, the emergence of  foodborne pathogens, such as escherichia coli o157:h7, cyclospora cayetanensis, noroviruses (norwalk-like viruses), cryptosporidium parvum, campylobacter jejuni, yersinia enterocolitica, and multi-drug-resistant salmonella, has identified a need for accurate laboratory diagnosis of enteric disease and outbreaks.

AB  == acclimatization of the psychrotolerant yersinia enterocolitica after a cold shock from 30 degrees c to 10 degrees c causes transcription of the major cold shock protein (csp) bicistronic gene cspa1/a2 to increase by up to 300-fold. northern blot analysis of cspa1/a2 using four probes that hybridize specifically to different regions of csp mrna revealed the appearance of a number of cspa1/a2 transcripts that are smaller than the original transcript and transiently visible at the end of the acclimation period. primer extension and rna protection experiments demonstrated that these smaller mrnas have 5' ends located in the same core sequence (5'-aguaaa-3') at five different places within the mrna, indicating preferential cleavage of the csp mrna transcripts. a similar result was obtained for cspb of escherichia coli, containing two such core sequences. furthermore, this motif is present in the major csp genes of a variety of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. we have therefore termed this sequence  cold shock cut box (csc-box). after inserting a csc-box into a plasmid-bound lacz gene in y. enterocolitica, the mrna of this construct was cleaved within the csc-box, and a change in this csc-box from aguaaa to aguccc dramatically reduced  cleavage of the mutated lacz gene. mutating all csc-boxes in y. enterocolitica of a plasmid bound cspa1/a2 dramatically increases the lag time after a cold shock before re-growth occurs. based on these results, we suggest that the role of the  csc-box is related to downregulation of cspa mrna after acclimation to low temperature.

TI  == incorporation of heterologous outer membrane and periplasmic proteins into escherichia coli outer membrane vesicles.
AB  == gram-negative bacteria shed outer membrane vesicles composed of outer membrane and periplasmic components. since vesicles from pathogenic bacteria contain virulence factors and have been shown to interact with eukaryotic cells, it has been proposed that vesicles behave as delivery vehicles. we wanted to determine whether heterologously expressed proteins would be incorporated into the membrane and lumen of vesicles and whether these altered vesicles would associate with host cells. ail, an outer membrane adhesin/invasin from yersinia enterocolitica,  was detected in purified outer membrane and in vesicles from escherichia coli strains dh5alpha, hb101, and mc4100 transformed with plasmid-encoded ail. in vesicle-host cell co-incubation assays we found that vesicles containing ail were internalized by eukaryotic cells, unlike vesicles without ail. to determine whether lumenal vesicle contents could be modified and delivered to host cells, we used periplasmically expressed green fluorescent protein (gfp). gfp fused with the tat signal sequence was secreted into the periplasm via the twin arginine transporter (tat) in both the laboratory e. coli strain dh5alpha and the pathogenic enterotoxigenic e. coli atcc strain 43886. pronase-resistant fluorescence was detectable in vesicles from tat-gfp-transformed strains, demonstrating that gfp was inside intact vesicles. inclusion of gfp cargo increased vesicle density but did not result in morphological changes in vesicles. these studies are the first to demonstrate the incorporation of heterologously expressed outer membrane and periplasmic proteins into bacterial vesicles.

AB  == to be effective in reducing the incidence of foodborne illness, consumers and food safety educators need information about behaviors that will decrease exposure to foodborne pathogens. a four-round delphi technique was used to survey nationally recognized experts in food microbiology, epidemiology, food safety education, and food safety policy with the aim of identifying and ranking food-handling and consumption behaviors associated with 13 major foodborne pathogens. the food safety experts ranked behaviors related to keeping foods at safe temperatures as of primary importance in preventing illness caused by bacillus cereus and clostridium perfringens and of secondary importance in preventing illness caused by staphylococcus aureus. the use of a thermometer to cook foods adequately was ranked as of primary importance for the prevention of illness caused by campylobacter jejuni, salmonella species, escherichia coli o157:h7, toxoplasma gondii, and yersinia enterocolitica, with the avoidance of cross-contamination being ranked as of secondary importance for most of these pathogens. hand washing was the top-ranked behavior for the prevention of shigellosis. the avoidance of certain foods that are likely to be contaminated was the top-ranked behavior for the prevention of illnesses caused by listeria monocytogenes, noroviruses, and vibrio species. the expert panel's ranking of behaviors for the reduction of the risk of illness caused by major foodborne pathogens can enable consumers to make informed choices about food consumption and handling behaviors and can guide food safety educators in prioritizing their  educational efforts.

TI  == the screening of hydrogen peroxide-producing lactic acid bacteria and their application to inactivating psychrotrophic food-borne pathogens.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria were isolated from various food samples and evaluated for hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) production. cells suspended in 0.5% (wt/vol) glucose plus 0.5% (wt/vol) lactate (ph 7.0) were incubated for 5 h at 37 degrees c under  aeration. among 193 strains, 27 strains accumulated 201-300 ppm h2o2, and 4 strains accumulated more than 301 ppm h2o2 in the cell suspensions. among the 9 high-level h2o2-producing strains, 8 strains were identified as lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis. the cell-free filtrate from lc. lactis subsp. lactis ai 62, which contained approximately 350 ppm h2o2, was evaluated for antimicrobial activity against enterococcus faecalis, ent. faecium, enterotoxigenic escherichia coli, listeria ivanovii, staphylococcus aureus, yersinia enterocolitica, and aeromonas hydrophila. after 1 h incubation at 30 degrees c in the cell-free filtrate, the initial viable cell counts of the target bacteria (5.53-6.00 log cfu/ml) were reduced by 0.12-5.00 log units, except in the case of enterococci. the sensitivity varied with the bacterial species and ph. the enterococci were resistant to the treatment. our results show that h2o2 accumulated by lactic acid bacteria in a cell suspension is very effective in reducing the viable cell count of food-borne pathogens.

TI  == identification of rpoe and nadb as host responsive elements of yersinia enterocolitica.
AB  == we describe the identification of the yersinia enterocolitica rpoe gene, which encodes the alternative sigma factor sigmae, and the divergently transcribed nadb gene, as genes that are expressed during infection of mice. as in escherichia coli, rpoe of y. enterocolitica is essential for growth and its expression is autoregulated. despite the similarities of the rpoe operons of y. enterocolitica  and e. coli, there are considerable differences in the response to extracytoplasmic stress. unlike in e. coli, sigmae of y. enterocolitica is not induced by heat shock or ethanol. overproduction of the outer membrane protein ail does not lead to the induction of rpoe expression. however, rpoe expression is induced by osmotic stress.

TI  == recombinant yersinia enterocolitica yscm1 and yscm2: homodimer formation and susceptibility to thrombin cleavage.
AB  == pathogenic yersinia species (y. enterocolitica, y. pestis, and y. pseudotuberculosis) make use of a virulence plasmid-encoded type three secretion  system (ttss) to inject effector proteins into host cells. y. enterocolitica yscm1 (lcrq in y. pestis and y. pseudotuberculosis) and its homologue yscm2 are regulatory components of the ttss that are also secreted by this transport apparatus. yscm1 and yscm2 share 57% identity and are believed to be functionally equivalent. we have recombinantly expressed and purified yscm1 and yscm2 in escherichia coli. after expression as glutathione s-transferase (gst) fusions purification to near homogeneity was achieved by glutathione-sepharose affinity chromatography followed by prescission protease treatment to cleave off gst and gel filtration on a superdex 75 column. such recombinant yscm1 and yscm2 bound efficiently to the specific chaperone sych, indicating proper folding of the purified proteins. gel filtration analyses revealed that both yscm1 and yscm2 formed homodimers. the yscm1 and yscm2 homodimers could be dissociated at high ionic strength, indicating that salt bridges essentially contribute to the dimerization. we further demonstrated that yscm1 and yscm2 are susceptible to thrombin cleavage.

TI  == a cryptic plasmid of yersinia enterocolitica encodes a conjugative transfer system related to the regions of clodf13 mob and incx pil.
AB  == yersinia enterocolitica 29930 (biotype 1a; o : 7,8), the producing strain of the  phage-tail-like bacteriocin enterocoliticin, possesses a plasmid-encoded conjugative type iv transfer system. the genes of the conjugative system were found by screening of a cosmid library constructed from total dna of strain 29930. the cosmid cos100 consists of the vector supercos1 and an insert dna of 40 303 bp derived from a cryptic plasmid of strain 29930. the conjugative transfer system consists of genes encoding a dna transfer and replication system (dtr) with close relationship to the mob region of the mobilizable plasmid clodf13 and  a gene cluster encoding a mating pair formation system (mpf) closely related to the mpf system of the incx plasmid r6k. however, a gene encoding a homologue of taxb, the coupling protein of the incx system, is missing. the whole transfer region has a size of approximately 17 kb. the recombinant plasmid cos100 was shown to be transferable between escherichia coli and yersinia with transfer frequencies up to 0.1 transconjugants per donor. mutations generated by inserting a tetracycline cassette into putative tri genes yielded a transfer-deficient phenotype. conjugative transfer of the cryptic plasmid could not be demonstrated  in the original host y. enterocolitica 29930. however, a kanamycin-resistance-conferring derivative of the plasmid was successfully introduced into e. coli k-12 by transformation and was shown to be self-transmissible. furthermore, southern blot hybridization and pcr experiments  were carried out to elucidate the distribution of the conjugative transfer system in yersinia. in total, six y. enterocolitica biotype 1a strains harbouring closely related systems on endogenous plasmids were identified.

TI  == antiplasmid effect of promethazine in mixed bacterial cultures.
AB  == promethazine has been recognised as an effective antiplasmid agent in cultures containing a single bacterial species such as escherichia coli, yersinia enterocolitica, staphylococcus aureus and agrobacterium tumefaciens. the objective of this study was to examine the effect of heterogenity of the microbial flora on plasmid elimination by promethazine in a laboratory based model system of mixed bacterial infection. f'lac plasmid elimination of e. coli k12 le140 was studied in the presence of a numerically predominant gram-positive  species (bacillus cereus, staphylococcus epidermidis) by promethazine (0-120 mg/l) at 23, 37 and 39 degrees c. growth kinetics of different bacterial species  were studied at various temperatures without drug treatment in mixed bacterial cultures and it was found that the small number of added bacteria overgrew the pre-existing flora during the incubation period. we observed that bacterial-bacterial interactions modified the growth rate of individual bacterial species and gave selective advantages to some bacterial species of the microbial  community. some interactions between coexisting bacterial species enhanced the frequency of plasmid curing by promethazine in mixed cultures with s. epidermidis. in our experiments the plasmid curing action of promethazine was more effective at elevated temperature than at lower temperatures.

TI  == angiotensin i-converting-enzyme-inhibitory and antibacterial peptides from lactobacillus helveticus pr4 proteinase-hydrolyzed caseins of milk from six species.
AB  == sodium caseinates prepared from bovine, sheep, goat, pig, buffalo or human milk were hydrolyzed by a partially purified proteinase of lactobacillus helveticus pr4. peptides in each hydrolysate were fractionated by reversed-phase fast-protein liquid chromatography. the fractions which showed the highest angiotensin i-converting-enzyme (ace)-inhibitory or antibacterial activity were sequenced by mass spectrum and edman degradation analyses. various ace-inhibitory peptides were found in the hydrolysates: the bovine alpha(s1)-casein (alpha(s1)-cn) 24-47 fragment (f24-47), f169-193, and beta-cn f58-76; ovine alpha(s1)-cn f1-6 and alpha(s2)-cn f182-185 and f186-188; caprine beta-cn f58-65  and alpha(s2)-cn f182-187; buffalo beta-cn f58-66; and a mixture of three tripeptides originating from human beta-cn. a mixture of peptides with a c-terminal sequence, pro-gly-pro, was found in the most active fraction of the pig sodium caseinate hydrolysate. the highest ace-inhibitory activity of some peptides corresponded to the concentration of the ace inhibitor (s)-n-(1-[ethoxycarbonyl]-3-phenylpropyl)-ala-pro maleate (enalapril) of 49.253 micro g/ml (100 micro mol/liter). several of the above sequences had features in  common with other ace-inhibitory peptides reported in the literature. the 50% inhibitory concentration (ic(50)) of some of the crude peptide fractions was very low (16 to 100 micro g/ml). some identified peptides were chemically synthesized, and the ace-inhibitory activity and ic(50)s were confirmed. an antibacterial peptide corresponding to beta-cn f184-210 was identified in human sodium caseinate hydrolysate. it showed a very large spectrum of inhibition against gram-positive and -negative bacteria, including species of potential clinical interest, such as enterococcus faecium, bacillus megaterium, escherichia coli, listeria innocua, salmonella spp., yersinia enterocolitica, and staphylococcus aureus. the mic for e. coli f19 was ca. 50 micro g/ml. once generated, the bioactive peptides were resistant to further degradation by proteinase of l. helveticus pr4 or by trypsin and chymotrypsin.

TI  == irp9, encoded by the high-pathogenicity island of yersinia enterocolitica, is able to convert chorismate into salicylate, the precursor of the siderophore yersiniabactin.
AB  == the irp9 protein of yersinia enterocolitica participates in the synthesis of salicylate, the precursor of the siderophore yersiniabactin. in pseudomonas species, salicylate synthesis is mediated by two enzymes: isochorismate synthase  and isochorismate pyruvate-lyase. both enzymes are required for complementation of a yersinia irp9 mutant. however, irp9 is not able to complement escherichia coli entc for the production of enterobactin, which requires isochorismate as a precursor. these results suggest that irp9 directly converts chorismate into salicylate.

TI  == screening of bifidobacterium strains isolated from human faeces for antagonistic  activities against potentially bacterial pathogens.
AB  == as probiotic bacteria, strains belonging to the genus bifidobacterium colonise the gastro-intestinal tract of humans and animals at the time of birth, and they  are found in young as well as in adult individuals in great numbers. moreover, they can interact with the development of enteric infections by the production of antimicrobial metabolites. in this work 281 strains of bifidobacteria were anaerobically isolated from human faecal samples, supplied by volunteers of different ages (youngs, adults, elders), and preliminarly described by microscopic observation. all strains were screened by the fructose 6-phosphate phosphoketolase (f6ppk) test in order to confirm their classification within the  genus bifidobacterium. selected strains were used to evaluate their antagonistic  activities against escherichia coli, salmonella thyphimurium, staphylococcus lentus, enterococcus faecalis, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, sphingomonas paucimobilis, listeria monocytogenes, yersinia enterocolitica, bacillus cereus, clostridium sporogenes. experiments were performed in vitro by different methods  based on the observation of growth inhibition in petri dishes. the strains that showed the highest inhibiting activities were compared by sds-page for total cell proteins, using type strains of human origin as references. representative isolates were metabolically characterised by the biolog system; a specific database was created with strains obtained from our collection and a statistical  evaluation for metabolic patterns was carried out.

TI  == sequence analysis of the genome of the temperate yersinia enterocolitica phage py54.
AB  == the temperate yersinia phage py54 belongs to the unusual group of phages that replicate as linear plasmids with covalently closed ends. besides escherichia coli phage n15, py54 is the only member of this group to be identified. we have determined the complete sequence (46,339 bp) of the py54 genome. bioinformatic analyses revealed 67 open reading frames (orfs) with good coding potential located on both dna strands. the comparison of the deduced py54 gene products with known proteins encoded by other phages and bacteria along with functional studies have enabled us to assign the possible functions of 25 orfs. in the left  arm of the py54 genome, we identified a number of orfs that obviously code for head and tail proteins. furthermore, this part of the phage genome contains genes probably involved in plasmid partitioning. regarding the predicted gene functions and gene order, the py54 and n15 left arms are similar. however, there are only weak dna homologies and, in contrast to n15, the yersinia phage harbours only a few orfs related to genes found in lambdoid phages. the py54 right arm comprises  mainly regulatory genes as well as genes important for plasmid replication, dna methylation, and host cell lysis. out of 36 deduced products of the right arm, 13 revealed strongest database homologies to n15 proteins, of which the protelomerase and the rep protein are exclusively homologous to their n15 counterparts. a number of py54 genes essential for the lytic or lysogenic cycle were identified by functional analysis and characterization of phage mutants. in  order to study transcription during the lytic and lysogenic stage, we analysed 34 py54 orfs by reverse transcriptase (rt)-pcr. the phage transcription patterns in  lysogenic bacteria and at the late lytic stage of infection are nearly identical. the reasons for this finding are spontaneous release of phages during lysogeny and a high rate of phages that lysogenize their yersinia host upon infection.

TI  == infectious agent and immune response characteristics of chronic enterocolitis in  captive rhesus macaques.
AB  == chronic enterocolitis is the leading cause of morbidity in colonies of captive rhesus macaques (macaca mulatta). this study's aim was to identify the common enteric pathogens frequently associated with chronic enterocolitis in normal, immunocompetent rhesus monkeys and to elucidate the influence of this clinical syndrome on the host immune system. we analyzed the fecal specimens from 100 rhesus macaques with or without clinical symptoms of chronic diarrhea. retrospective analysis revealed an increased incidence of campylobacter spp. (campylobacter coli and campylobacter jejuni), shigella flexneri, yersinia enterocolitica, adenovirus, and strongyloides fulleborni in samples collected from animals with chronic diarrhea (p < 0.05). the presence of additional enteric pathogens, such as escherichia coli, carrying the eaea intimin or stx2c shiga toxin virulence genes, balantidium coli, giardia lamblia, enterocytozoon bieneusi, and trichuris trichiura was found in all animals regardless of whether  diarrhea was present. in addition, the upregulation of interleukin-1 alpha (il-1  alpha), il-3, and tumor necrosis factor alpha cytokine genes, accompanied by an increased presence of activated (cd4(+) cd69(+)) t lymphocytes was found in gut-associated lymphoid tissues collected from animals with chronic enterocolitis and diarrhea in comparison with clinically healthy controls (p < 0.05). these data indicate that chronic enterocolitis and diarrhea are associated, in part, with a variety of enteric pathogens and highlight the importance of defining the  microbiological status of nonhuman primates used for infectious disease studies.  the data also suggest that chronic colitis in rhesus macaques may have potential  as a model of inflammatory bowel disease in humans.

TI  == py54, a linear plasmid prophage of yersinia enterocolitica with covalently closed ends.
AB  == py54 is a temperate phage isolated from yersinia enterocolitica. lysogenic yersinia strains harbour the py54 prophage as a plasmid (py54). the plasmid has the same size (46 kb) as the py54 genome isolated from phage particles. by electron microscopy, restriction analysis and dna sequencing, it was demonstrated that the phage and the plasmid dnas are linear, circularly permuted molecules. unusually for phages of gram-negative bacteria, the phage genome has 3'-protruding ends. the linear plasmid py54 has covalently closed ends forming telomere-like hairpins. the equivalent dna sequence of the phage genome is a 42 bp perfect palindrome. downstream from the palindrome, an open reading frame (orf) was identified that revealed strong dna homology to the teln gene of escherichia coli phage n15 encoding a protelomerase. similar to py54, the n15 prophage is a linear plasmid with telomeres. the n15 protelomerase has cleaving/joining activity generating the telomeres by processing a 56 bp palindrome (telomere resolution site tel rl). to study the activity of the py54 protein, the teln-like gene was cloned and expressed in e. coli. a 77 kda protein was obtained and partially purified. the protein was found to process recombinant plasmids containing the 42 bp palindrome. telomere resolution of plasmids under in vivo conditions was also investigated in yersinia infected with py54. processing required a plasmid containing the palindrome as well as adjacent dna sequences from the phage including an additional inverted repeat. regions on the  phage genome important for plasmid maintenance were defined by the construction of linear and circular miniplasmid derivatives of py54, of which the smallest miniplasmid comprises a 4.5 kb dna fragment of the plasmid prophage.

AB  == emerging water-borne pathogens constitute a major health hazard in both developed and developing nations. a new dimension to the global epidemiology of cholera-an  ancient scourge-was provided by the emergence of vibrio cholerae o139. also, water-borne enterohaemorrhagic escherichia coli ( e. coli o157:h7), although regarded as a problem of the industrialized west, has recently caused outbreaks in africa. outbreaks of chlorine-resistant cryptosporidium have motivated water authorities to reassess the adequacy of current water-quality regulations. of late, a host of other organisms, such as hepatitis viruses (including hepatitis e virus), campylobacter jejuni, microsporidia, cyclospora, yersinia enterocolitica, calciviruses and environmental bacteria like mycobacterium spp, aeromonads, legionella pneumophila and multidrug-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa have been associated with water-borne illnesses. this review critically examines the potential of these as emerging water-borne pathogens. it also examines the possible reasons, such as an increase in the number of immunocompromised individuals, urbanization and horizontal gene transfer, that may underlie their emergence. further, measures required to face the challenge posed by these pathogens are also discussed.

TI  == identification of a truncated tn1721-like transposon located on a small plasmid of escherichia coli isolated from varanus indicus.
AB  == the 9.1 kb plasmid pdewt1 was isolated from an escherichia coli strain obtained from the faeces of a free-living lizard (varanus indicus) in indonesia. this plasmid mediated tetracycline resistance via a tet gene of hybridization class a. molecular analysis of a 7755 bp segment of plasmid pdewt1 including the tetr-tet(a) region and its flanking areas suggested that pdewt1 harboured a truncated copy of the tet(a)-carrying transposon tn1721 in which the part responsible for chemotaxis and transposition functions was lost. analysis of the  sequences at the integration site revealed the presence of the 5-bp direct repeat tactt. the sequences upstream and downstream of the integration site showed striking homology to sequences of a non-coding region detectable on a small cryptic plasmid from yersinia enterocolitica.

TI  == autodisplay: development of an efficacious system for surface display of antigenic determinants in salmonella vaccine strains.
AB  == to optimize antigen delivery by salmonella vaccine strains, a system for surface  display of antigenic determinants was established by using the autotransporter secretion pathway of gram-negative bacteria. a modular system for surface display allowed effective targeting of heterologous antigens or fragments thereof to the  bacterial surface by the autotransporter domain of aida-i, the escherichia coli adhesin involved in diffuse adherence. a major histocompatibility complex class ii-restricted epitope, comprising amino acids 74 to 86 of the yersinia enterocolitica heat shock protein hsp60 (hsp60(74-86)), was fused to the aida-i autotransporter domain, and the resulting fusion protein was expressed at high levels on the cell surface of e. coli and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium. colonization studies in mice vaccinated with salmonella strains expressing aida-i fusion proteins demonstrated high genetic stability of the generated vaccine strain in vivo. furthermore, a pronounced t-cell response against yersinia hsp60(74-86) was induced in mice vaccinated with a salmonella vaccine strain expressing the hsp60(74-86)-aida-i fusion protein. this was shown  by monitoring yersinia hsp60-stimulated ifn-gamma secretion and proliferation of  splenic t cells isolated from vaccinated mice. these results demonstrate that the surface display of antigenic determinants by the autotransporter pathway deserves special attention regarding the application in live attenuated salmonella vaccine strains.

TI  == prevalence of bacterial faecal pathogens in separated and unseparated stored pig  slurry.
AB  == aims: to examine the prevalence and diversity of bacterial faecal pathogens in unseparated slurry, separated solids and liquid fractions from a commercial pig farm. methods: a total of 43 stored slurry specimens originating from a fattening house over the period february-april 2002 were analysed, consisting of unseparated (n = 14) slurry, separated solids (n = 16) and separated liquid (n =  13). specimens were examined for the presence of five bacterial pathogens including salmonella spp., shigella spp., campylobacter spp., escherichia coli o157 and yersinia enterocolitica. selective enrichment and plating methods were employed for detection of salmonella spp. and campylobacter spp. and conventional selective plating techniques for the remaining genera. antibiogram profiles to 12 antibiotic agents were obtained for all salmonella isolates obtained. results: salmonella spp. were identified in all components of the slurry specimens, whereas campylobacter spp. was only recovered from the unseparated and separated  liquid fractions. in both cases, the separated liquid fraction had the highest prevalence of pathogens and the separated solid fraction had the lowest prevalence. none of the slurry specimens examined were positive for e. coli o157:h7, shigella spp. or y. enterocolitica. twenty-nine isolates of salmonella were recovered from the slurry specimens, comprising seven serovars, of which salmonella manhattan was the most prevalent, accounting for over half [15 of 29 (51.7%)] of all salmonella isolates. salmonella anatum, salm. derby, salm. give,  salm. heidelberg, salm. simi and salm. stanley serovars were also recovered. all  salmonella isolates were sensitive to ampicillin, augmentin (amoxicillin/clavulanic acid), chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, kanamycin and trimethoprim, but has variable resistance to tetracycline (100%), sulphonamides (84.6%), furazolidone (38.5%), nalidixic acid (15.4%) and streptomycin (15.4%). the majority (57.7%) of isolates displayed antibiotic resistance to at least two antibiotic agents, followed by 34.6% of isolates being resistant to three agents and the remainder (7.7%) being resistant to four antibiotics. significance and impact of the study: this study demonstrated a marked reduction in the prevalence of campylobacter and salmonella in the solids  component of separated pig slurry. the adoption of control processes such as aeration of slurry prior to its spread onto agricultural land and newer approaches to pathogen reduction should be investigated, to reduce the transmission of pathogens from pig slurry to the environment.

TI  == detection of type iii secretion genes as a general indicator of bacterial virulence.
AB  == type iii secretion systems of gram-negative bacteria are specific export machineries for virulence factors which allow their translocation to eukaryotic cells. since they correlate with bacterial pathogenicity, their presence is used  as a general indicator of bacterial virulence. by comparing the genetic relationship of the major type iii secretion systems we found the family of genes encoding the inner-membrane channel proteins represented by the yersinia enterocolitica lcrd (synonym yscv) and its homologous genes from other species an ideal component for establishing a general detection approach for type iii secretion systems. based on the genes of the lcrd family we developed gene probes for gram-negative human, animal and plant pathogens. the probes comprise lcrd from y. enterocolitica, sepa from enteropathogenic escherichia coli, inva from salmonella typhimurium, mxia from shigella sonnei, as well as hrcv from erwinia amylovora. in addition we included as a control probe the flha gene from e. coli  k-12 to validate our approach. flha is part of the flagellar export apparatus which shows a high degree of similarity with type iii secretions systems, but is  not involved in pathogenicity. the probes were evaluated by screening a series of pathogenic as well as non-pathogenic bacteria. the probes detected type iii secretion in pathogens where such systems were either known or were expected to be present, whereas no positive hybridization signals could be found in non-pathogenic gram-negative bacteria. gram-positive bacteria were devoid of known type iii secretion systems. no interference due to the genetic similarity between the type iii secretion system and the flagellar export apparatus was observed. however, potential type iii secretion systems could be detected in bacteria where no such systems have been described yet. the presented approach provides therefore a useful tool for the assessment of the virulence potential of bacterial isolates of human, animal and plant origin. moreover, it is a powerful  means for a first safety assessment of poorly characterized strains intended to be used in biotechnological applications.

TI  == analysis of microbial mixtures by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry.
AB  == many different laboratories are currently developing mass-spectrometric techniques to analyze and identify microorganisms. however, minimal work has been done with mixtures of bacteria. to demonstrate that microbial mixtures could be analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (maldi-ms), mixed bacterial cultures were analyzed in a double-blind fashion. nine different bacterial species currently in our maldi-ms fingerprint library were used to generate 50 different simulated mixed bacterial cultures similar to  that done for an initial blind study previously reported (jarman, k. h.; cebula,  s. t.; saenz, a. j.; petersen, c. e.; valentine, n. b.; kingsley, m. t.; wahl, k. l. anal. chem. 2000, 72, 1217-1223). the samples were analyzed by maldi-ms with automated data extraction and analysis algorithms developed in our laboratory. the components present in the sample were identified correctly to the species level in all but one of the samples. however, correctly eliminating closely related organisms was challenging for the current algorithms, especially in differentiating serratia marcescens, escherichia coli, and yersinia enterocolitica, which have some similarities in their maldi-ms fingerprints. efforts to improve the specificity of the algorithms are in progress.

TI  == serum concentration of hakata antigen, a member of the ficolins, is linked with inhibition of aerococcus viridans growth.
AB  == background: hakata antigen (hakata) is a novel serum glycoprotein that consists of collagen- and fibrinogen-like domains, similar to ficolin/p35. our research suggested that serum hakata may be a target of a polysaccharide (psa) produced by aerococcus viridans. methods: a. viridans was incubated with human plasma and hakata-depleted plasma to examine hakata binding and growth inhibition of a. viridans through binding with psa. results: when a. viridans was mixed with human acid citrate dextrose-one (acd-a) plasma, it pulled down hakata complexed with mannose-binding lectin (mbl)-associated serine proteases 1 and 2 (masp-1 and masp-2). this complex had the potential for c4 deposition. serum hakata circulates as hakata-masps complex in the blood and is proteolytically active. by mixing a. viridans with human plasma, we prepared a hakata-depleted plasma, deficient in hakata-masps complex. this plasma failed to inhibit a. viridans growth plasma, but does not inhibit staphylococcus aureus, yersinia enterocolitica and escherichia coli. however, a decrease of growth inhibition of  a. viridans in hakata-depleted plasma could be restored by adding a hakata-masps  complex preparation in a dose-dependent manner. on the other hand, the hakata-masps complex exhibited strong binding to a. viridans, but not to s. aureus, y. enterocolitica and e. coli. conclusions: the serum concentration of hakata is linked with growth inhibition of a. viridans upon binding of hakata via psa.

TI  == genes encoding specific nickel transport systems flank the chromosomal urease locus of pathogenic yersiniae.
AB  == the transition metal nickel is an essential cofactor for a number of bacterial enzymes, one of which is urease. prior to its incorporation into metalloenzyme active sites, nickel must be imported into the cell. here, we report identification of two loci corresponding to nickel-specific transport systems in  the gram-negative, ureolytic bacterium yersinia pseudotuberculosis. the loci are  located on each side of the chromosomal urease gene cluster ureabcefgd and have the same orientation as the latter. the yntabcde locus upstream of the ure genes  encodes five predicted products with sequence homology to atp-binding cassette nickel permeases present in several gram-negative bacteria. the ureh gene, located downstream of ure, encodes a single-component carrier which displays homology to polypeptides of the nickel-cobalt transporter family. transporters with homology to these two classes are also present (again in proximity to the urease locus) in the other two pathogenic yersiniae, y. pestis and y. enterocolitica. an escherichia coli nika insertion mutant recovered nickel uptake ability following heterologous complementation with either the ynt or the ureh plasmid-borne gene of y. pseudotuberculosis, demonstrating that each carrier is necessary and sufficient for nickel transport. deletion of ynt in y. pseudotuberculosis almost completely abolished bacterial urease activity, whereas deletion of ureh had no effect. nevertheless, rates of nickel transport were significantly altered in both ynt and ureh mutants. furthermore, the ynt ureh double mutant was totally devoid of nickel uptake ability, thus indicating that ynt and ureh constitute the only routes for nickel entry. both ynt and ureh show  selectivity for ni(2+) ions. this is the first reported identification of genes coding for both kinds of nickel-specific permeases situated adjacent to the urease gene cluster in the genome of a microorganism.

TI  == development of an elisa using a recombinant 41 kda partial protein (p45n') for the detection of riemerella anatipestifer infections in ducks.
AB  == riemerella anatipestifer, a gram-negative bacillus, is the causative agent of duck septicemia, a disease which could incur much economic loss in the duck industry. an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) has been developed to facilitate early detection of r. anatipestifer infection in ducks. the antigen used was a recombinant 41 kda n-terminal fragment (rp45n') of a newly characterized r. anatipestifer potential surface protein, p45, which was expressed in escherichia coli as an n-terminal gst fusion protein. the rp45n'-based elisa successfully detected p45 antibodies in the sera of 20 ducks immunized with bacterin preparations of r. anatipestifer serotypes 1, 10 15, 19 and the atcc11845 strain. antibodies to p45 were also detected in the sera of 25% (75/296) of white pekin ducks which were imported into singapore from three different farms. successful discrimination was obtained between sera from infected ducks and that of specific-pathogen free ducks (p<0.01). the rp45n'-gst  antigen did not cross-react with antibodies in sera from guinea pigs which were infected with other gram-negative and gram-positive bacterial pathogens, including aeromonas hydrophila, citrobacter freundii, e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pastuerella multocida, proteus mirabilis, salmonella spp., serratia maccescens, shigella sonnei and yersinia enterocolitica. in addition, the dna sequence encoding p45 was detected in r. anatipestifer serotypes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 and the atcc11845 strain, suggesting that  p45 is probably also universally expressed in these r. anatipestifer serotypes. thus, the elisa described is applicable to the detection of r. anatipestifer infection in ducks.

TI  == single-tube, nested pcr for the diagnosis of human brucellosis in kuwait.
AB  == the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) offers a sensitive and specific way of detecting microbial dna in clinical samples. the aims of the present study were to develop an assay, based on a single-tube, nested pcr, for identifying brucella in samples of human blood and then to explore the use of this test in diagnosis.  the primers chosen were derived from is711, the insertion sequence gene found in  all species of brucella. the assay amplified a 52-bp final product which was detected colorimetrically. the pcr was sensitive and specific, giving positive reactions with 14 strains of brucella from five species. the lower limit of detection in vitro was 30 organisms. there were no false-positive reactions either with a range of bacteria known to evoke serological cross-reactions with brucella (vibrio cholerae, yersinia enterocolitica, serratia marcescens, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli k12) or with  organisms producing similar clinical syndromes (mycobacterium tuberculosis and salmonella typhi). the results of a preliminary field trial of the assay in kuwait indicate that the assay may be a valuable technique in the diagnosis of human brucellosis, meriting further study with larger numbers of cases. all 28 subjects with brucellosis (diagnosed on the basis of typical clinical features and confirmed by positive serology and, in three cases, by positive blood cultures) were pcr-positive whereas 28 healthy controls and 28 patients with febrile illness attributable to infections other than brucellosis were pcr-negative.

TI  == characterization of the ysa pathogenicity locus in the chromosome of yersinia enterocolitica and phylogeny analysis of type iii secretion systems.
AB  == several gram negative bacteria use a complex system called "type iii secretion system" (ttss) to engage their host. the archetype of ttss is the plasmid-encoded "yop virulon" shared by the three species of pathogenic yersinia (y. pestis, y. pseudotuberculosis, and y. enterocolitica). a second ttss, called ysa (for yersinia secretion apparatus) was recently described in y. enterocolitica 8081, a strain from serotype o:8. in this study, we describe the ysa locus from a127/90,  another strain of serotype o:8, and we extend the sequence to several new genes encoding ysp proteins which are the substrates of this secretion system, and a putative chaperone sycb. according to the deduced protein sequences, the ysa system from a127/90 is identical to that of 8081. it is different from the chromosome-encoded ttss of y. pestis but is instead closely related to the mxi-spa ttss of shigella and to the spi-1 encoded ttss of salmonella enterica. we further demonstrated that the ysa locus is only present in biotype ib strains of  y. enterocolitica. including this new ysa system, a phylogenetic analysis of the  26 known ttsss was carried out, based on the sequence analysis of three conserved proteins. all the ttsss fall into five different clusters. the phylogenetic tree  of these ttsss is completely different from the evolutionary tree based on 16s rna, indicating that ttsss have been distributed by horizontal transfer.

TI  == plant-specific promoter sequences carry elements that are recognised by the eubacterial transcription machinery.
AB  == during evolution the promoter elements from prokaryotes and eukaryotes have developed differently with regard to their sequence and structure, implying that  in general a transfer of eukaryotic promoter sequences into prokaryotes will not  cause an efficient gene expression. however, there have been reports on the functionality of the 35s promoter from cauliflower mosaic virus (camv) in bacteria. we therefore decided to experimentally investigate the capability of plant promoter sequences to direct gene expression in various bacteria. accordingly, we tested ten different plant-specific promoters from solanum tuberosum, nicotiana tabacum, camv, agrobacterium tumefaciens, and a. rhizogenes  for their ability to initiate transcription in five different eubacterial species (escherichia coli, yersinia enterocolitica, a. tumefaciens, pseudomonas putida, and acinetobacter sp. bd413). to monitor the strength of the plant-specific promoters in bacteria we created fusions between these promoters and the coding region of the luciferase genes from vibrio harveyi and measured the luminescence  in the bacteria. heterologous gene expression was observed in 50% of the combinations analysed. we then mapped the transcription start site caused by one  of the plant-specific promoters, the st-ls1 promoter from s. tuberosum, in these  bacterial species. the location of the mapped transcription start site indicated  that the sequences of the plant promoter themselves were recognised by the bacterial transcription apparatus. the recognition of plant-specific promoter sequences by the bacterial rna polymerase was further confirmed by site-directed  mutagenesis of the st-ls1 promoter and the analysis of the effects of the mutations on the strength of gene expression in e. coli. using these mutants in our reporter assays we could localise the sequences of the st-ls1 promoter serving as -10 region in e. coli. the results of our study show that promoter sequences are much less specific than is generally assumed. this is of great importance for our knowledge about the evolution of gene expression systems and for the construction of optimised expression vectors.

TI  == functional characterization of gne (udp-n-acetylglucosamine-4-epimerase), wzz (chain length determinant), and wzy (o-antigen polymerase) of yersinia enterocolitica serotype o:8.
AB  == the lipopolysaccharide (lps) o-antigen of yersinia enterocolitica serotype o:8 is formed by branched pentasaccharide repeat units that contain n-acetylgalactosamine (galnac), l-fucose (fuc), d-galactose (gal), d-mannose (man), and 6-deoxy-d-gulose (6d-gul). its biosynthesis requires at least enzymes  for the synthesis of each nucleoside diphosphate-activated sugar precursor; five  glycosyltransferases, one for each sugar residue; a flippase (wzx); and an o-antigen polymerase (wzy). as this lps shows a characteristic preferred o-antigen chain length, the presence of a chain length determinant protein (wzz)  is also expected. by targeted mutagenesis, we identify within the o-antigen gene  cluster the genes encoding wzy and wzz. we also present genetic and biochemical evidence showing that the gene previously called gale encodes a udp-n-acetylglucosamine-4-epimerase (ec 5.1.3.7) required for the biosynthesis of the first sugar of the o-unit. accordingly, the gene was renamed gne. gne also has some udp-glucose-4-epimerase (ec 5.1.3.2) activity, as it restores the core production of an escherichia coli k-12 gale mutant. the three-dimensional structure of gne was modeled based on the crystal structure of e. coli gale. detailed structural comparison of the active sites of gne and gale revealed that  additional space is required to accommodate the n-acetyl group in gne and that this space is occupied by two tyr residues in gale whereas the corresponding residues present in gne are leu136 and cys297. the gne leu136tyr and cys297tyr variants completely lost the udp-n-acetylglucosamine-4-epimerase activity while retaining the ability to complement the lps phenotype of the e. coli gale mutant. finally, we report that yersinia wzx has relaxed specificity for the translocated oligosaccharide, contrary to wzy, which is strictly specific for the o-unit to be polymerized.

TI  == reduction of iron by extracellular iron reductases: implications for microbial iron acquisition.
AB  == the extracellular enzymatic reduction of iron by microorganisms has not been appropriately considered. in this study the reduction and release of iron from ferrioxamine were examined using extracellular microbial iron reductases and compared to iron mobilization by chemical reductants, and to chelation by edta and desferrioxamine. a flavin semiquinone was formed during the enzymatic reduction of ferrioxamine, which was consistent with the 1 e(-) reduction of iron by an enzyme. the rates for the enzymatic reactions were substantially faster than both the 2 e(-) chemical reductions and the chelation reactions. the rapid rates of the enzymatic reduction reactions demonstrated that these enzymes are capable of accomplishing the extracellular mobilization of iron required by microorganisms. the data suggest that mechanistically there are two phases for the mobilization and transport of iron by those microorganisms that produce both  extracellular iron reductases and siderophores, with reduction being the principle pathway.

TI  == mononuclear cell response to enterobacteria and gram-positive cell walls of normal intestinal microbiota in early rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory arthritides.
AB  == objective: to study whether enterobacteria and gram-positive bacterial cell walls (bcw) derivedfrom normal intestinal microbiota are involved in the etiopathogenesis of early rheumatoid arthritis (ra). methods: peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc) and synovial fluid mononuclear cells (sfmc) were isolatedfrom patients with early ra (the average duration of 5 months) and the controls (other types of inflammatory arthritis). the mononuclear cell proliferation and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) responses to heat-killed salmonella enteritidis (se). yersinia enterocolitica (ye), and escherichia coli (ec), and to gram-positive bcw derived from four common intestinal indigenous bacteria, eubacterium aerofaciens (ea), eubacterium limosum (el), lactobacillus casei (lc), and lactobacillus fermentum (lf), and a bcw derived from a pathogen, streptococcus pyogenes (sp) were investigated. results:  39% or 56% of patients with early ra showed significant proliferation responses by pbmc or sfmc against enterobacteria, respectively. in other types of arthritis, corresponding figures were 59% or 66%. when bcw were used as antigens, 8.1% or 23% of patients with early ra showed proliferation responses by pbmc or sfmc, respectively. in other types of arthritis the corresponding figures were 7.5% or 35%, respectively. however, tnf-alpha production by sfmc stimulated by ea bcw, se, ye or ec, was significantly higher in early ra than in other types of arthritis. conclusion: these results suggest that sfmc reacting with enterobacteria or bcw exist in some patients with early ra, but also in other types of inflammatory arthritis. intestinal bacterial agents may play a role in the etiopathogenesis of ra, but the effect appears to be non-specific.

TI  == up-regulation of the yersinia enterocolitica yop regulon by deletion of the flagellum master operon flhdc.
AB  == the yop virulon enables extracellularly located yersinia, in close contact with a eukaryotic target cell, to inject bacterial toxic proteins directly into the cytosol of this cell. several ysc proteins, forming the yop secretion apparatus,  display homology with proteins of the flagellar basal body. to determine whether  this relationship could extend to the regulatory pathways, we analyzed the influence of flhdc, the master regulatory operon of the flagellum, on the yop regulon. in an flhdc mutant, the yop regulon was up-regulated. the transcription  of virf and the steady-state level of the transcriptional activator virf were enhanced. yop transcription was increased at 37 degrees c and could also be detected at a low temperature. yop secretion was increased at 37 degrees c and occurred even at a low temperature. the ysc secretion machinery was thus functional at room temperature in the absence of flagella, implying that in wild-type bacteria, flhd and/or flhc, or the product of a gene downstream of flhdc, represses the yop regulon. in agreement with this notion, increased expression of flhdc in wild-type bacteria resulted in the oversecretion of flagellins at room temperature and in decreased yop secretion at 37 degrees c.

TI  == specific entry of helicobacter pylori into cultured gastric epithelial cells via  a zipper-like mechanism.
AB  == although helicobacter pylori has generally been considered an extracellular pathogen, a number of in vitro infection experiments and biopsy examinations have shown that it is capable of occasionally entering mammalian host cells. here, we  characterized this entry process by using ags cells as a host cell model. in gentamicin protection-invasion assays, the number of h. pylori colonies recovered was lower than that for salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium x22, escherichia  coli expressing inva, and yersinia enterocolitica yo:9 grown at 25 degrees c but  higher than that for neisseria gonorrhoeae vp1 and y. enterocolitica yo:9 grown at 37 degrees c. at the ultrastructural level, the entry process was observed to  occur via a zipper-like mechanism. internalized h. pylori was bound in tight lamp-1-containing vacuoles in close association with condensed filamentous actin  and tyrosine phosphorylation signals. wortmannin, a potent inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and calphostin c, an inhibitor of protein kinase c, both inhibited the entry of h. pylori in a sensitive and dose-dependent manner; however, the level of entry was enhanced by sodium vanadate, an inhibitor of tyrosine phosphatases and atpases. furthermore, the cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha antagonized the entry of h. pylori into ags cells. collectively, these results demonstrate that the entry of h. pylori into ags cells occurs via a zipper-like mechanism which involves various host signal transduction events.

TI  == role of the hha/ymoa family of proteins in the thermoregulation of the expression of virulence factors.
AB  == virulent bacteria are able to sense temperature changes and respond by modifying  the expression of--among others--genes that code for virulence factors. the chromatin-associated protein h-ns has been shown to play a role in the thermomodulation of virulence factor expression. in addition to h-ns, proteins of the hha/ymoa family have also been identified in different enterobacteria as participating in the thermoregulation of some virulence factors. for one of these proteins, the hha protein, it has been shown that it interacts with h-ns, and both proteins form a nucleoid-protein complex responsible for the thermoregulation of, at least, e. coli hemolysin. the presence of genes coding for homologues of both proteins on some conjugative plasmids and their relation to thermoregulation suggests that this complex could also play a role in the regulation of plasmid transfer.

TI  == efficient insertion mutagenesis strategy for bacterial genomes involving electroporation of in vitro-assembled dna transposition complexes of bacteriophage mu.
AB  == an efficient insertion mutagenesis strategy for bacterial genomes based on the phage mu dna transposition reaction was developed. incubation of mua transposase  protein with artificial mini-mu transposon dna in the absence of divalent cations in vitro resulted in stable but inactive mu dna transposition complexes, or transpososomes. following delivery into bacterial cells by electroporation, the complexes were activated for dna transposition chemistry after encountering divalent metal ions within the cells. mini-mu transposons were integrated into bacterial chromosomes with efficiencies ranging from 10(4) to 10(6) cfu/microg of input transposon dna in the four species tested, i.e., escherichia coli, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, erwinia carotovora, and yersinia enterocolitica. efficiency of integration was influenced mostly by the competence status of a given strain or batch of bacteria. an accurate 5-bp target site duplication flanking the transposon, a hallmark of mu transposition, was generated upon mini-mu integration into the genome, indicating that a genuine dna transposition reaction was reproduced within the cells of the bacteria studied. this insertion mutagenesis strategy for microbial genomes may be applicable to a  variety of organisms provided that a means to introduce dna into their cells is available.

TI  == antibodies against homologous microbial caseinolytic proteases p characterise primary biliary cirrhosis.
AB  == background/aims: antibodies to caseinolytic protease p(177-194) (clpp(177-194)) of the proteolytic subunit of the clp complex of escherichia coli (e. coli) are uniquely present in primary biliary cirrhosis (pbc). molecular mimicry between the regulatory subunit clpx and the principal t-cell epitope of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (pdc-e2) in pbc, has been proposed to account for this. since clpp is highly conserved among bacteria we investigated whether the micro-organisms triggering these antibodies may be other than e. coli. methods/results: e. coli clpp(177-194) is homologous with clpp peptides of yersinia enterocolitica (yeren) and haemophilus influenzae (haein). enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) reactivity to these peptides was tested in 45 patients with pbc, 44 pathological and 32 healthy controls. reactivity to at least one of the clpp peptides was observed in 21 (47%) pbc patients, 5.8% pathological and 3.1% healthy controls (p<0.01 for all). among these 21 seropositive pbc patients, 15 (71%) reacted to ecoli clpp(177-194), alone or in association with yeren and/or haein peptides, compared to three (14.2%) reactive  with yeren, two (9.5%) with yeren/haein and one (4.7%) with haein peptide. simultaneous reactivity to homologous sequences was due to cross-reactivity as confirmed by competition elisas. conclusions: the pbc-specificity of anti-microbial clpp reactivity is confirmed: the questions as to primary trigger(s) and relevance to pbc pathogenesis remain open.

TI  == evidence for direct protein-protein interaction between members of the enterobacterial hha/ymoa and h-ns families of proteins.
AB  == escherichia coli nucleoid-associated h-ns protein interacts with the hha protein, a member of a new family of global modulators that also includes the ymoa protein from yersinia enterocolitica. this interaction has been found to be involved in the regulation of the expression of the toxin alpha-hemolysin. in this study, we  further characterize the interaction between h-ns and hha. we show that the presence of dna in preparations of copurified his-hha and h-ns is not directly implicated in the interaction between the proteins. the precise molecular mass of the h-ns protein retained by hha, obtained by mass spectrometry analysis, does not show any posttranslational modification other than removal of the n-terminal  met residue. we constructed an h-ns-his recombinant protein and found that, as expected, it interacts with hha. we used a ni(2+)-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose method for affinity chromatography copurification of proteins to identify the h-ns protein of y. enterocolitica. we constructed a six-his-ymoa recombinant protein derived from ymoa, the homologue of hha in y. enterocolitica, and found that it interacts with y. enterocolitica h-ns. we also cloned and sequenced the hns gene of this microorganism. in the course of these experiments we found that  his-ymoa can also retain h-ns from e. coli. we also found that the hns gene of y. enterocolitica can complement an hns mutation of e. coli. finally, we describe for the first time systematic characterization of missense mutant alleles of hha  and truncated hha' proteins, and we report a striking and previously unnoticed similarity of the hha family of proteins to the oligomerization domain of the h-ns proteins.

TI  == prevention and management of infection in children with sickle cell anaemia.
AB  == sickle cell anaemia (sca) predisposes a child to infections for various reasons,  including increased bone marrow turnover, poor perfusion and functional asplenia  leading to decreased opsonisation of polysaccharide encapsulated organisms. bacteria and viruses that most frequently cause serious infections in children with sickle cell disease are streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae type b, salmonella spp., escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, mycoplasma pneumoniae, chlamydia pneumoniae, parvovirus b19 and hepatitis a, b and c viruses. penicillin prophylaxis has decreased the incidence of infection-related  morbidity and mortality significantly in children with sca. children <3 years of  age are administered oral penicillin 125mg twice daily, and the dose is increased to 250mg twice daily for the >3 to 5 year age group. adherence to the penicillin  prophylactic regimen is recommended for children with sca who are >5 years of age. for children with sca who have recurrent invasive pneumococcal infections, an effort is made to keep the child on penicillin prophylaxis indefinitely. the administration of various childhood vaccines has also made an appreciable impact  on the overall morbidity and mortality associated with infection in children with sca. the administration of the heptavalent conjugate pneumococcal vaccine (pcv7)  has provided control of invasive pneumococcal infections, and the prophylactic use of the h. influenzae type b conjugate vaccine has reduced the incidence of septicaemia and meningitis caused by this organism. other vaccines used prophylactically in children with sca include hepatitis a and b, and vaccines against influenza and varicella viruses. the immediate administration of intravenous antibacterials, after appropriate blood and urine cultures, is of great importance in the treatment of the febrile child with sca. ceftriaxone and  cefotaxime have been recommended for the treatment of septic episodes in sca associated with s. pneumoniae, haemophilus and salmonella spp. infection with yersinia enterocolitica may be treated with cefotaxime or an aminoglycoside. the  prevalence of helicobacter pylori infection in sca is unknown. effective therapies include metronidazole, tetracycline or amoxicillin. parvovirus infections require supportive care and specific antiviral therapy is not indicated. the judicious use of antimicrobials is encouraged in view of the worldwide emergence of multidrug-resistant strains. the long term sequelae associated with infections in children with sca can be decreased with the implementation of immunisation programmes and effective and prompt treatment with appropriate antibacterials.

TI  == recombinant yersinia yopt leads to uncoupling of rhoa-effector interaction.
AB  == yersinia enterocolitica, yersinia pseudotuberculosis, and yersinia pestis deliver different yop (yersinia outer proteins) effector proteins into mammalian cells by a type iii secretion mechanism. recently, it was shown that yersinia producing yopt leads to disruption of the actin cytoskeleton of hela cells (m. iriarte and  g. r. cornelis, mol. microbiol. 29:915-929, 1998). to analyze the molecular mechanism of yopt, we cloned and expressed yopt as a glutathione s-transferase fusion protein. recombinant yopt caused rounding up of embryonic bovine lung cells and redistribution of the actin cytoskeleton rapidly after microinjection.  the escherichia coli cytotoxic necrotizing factor (cnf1), which constitutively activates rho proteins, was not able to inhibit or revert yopt-induced cell rounding. yopt caused release of rhoa from embryonic bovine lung membranes and released recombinant isoprenylated rhoa from artificial pe or pe/pip2 vesicles. incubation of lysate or cytosol with yopt caused inhibition of the rhoa-rhotekin  interaction but led to increased rhoa-rhogdi interaction. it is suggested that inhibition of the interaction between rhoa and effectors is the underlying mechanism of the yopt action on the cytoskeleton.

TI  == acute diarrhoea in children treated in an outpatient setting in athens, greece.
AB  == objective: to describe the epidemiology and aetiology of acute diarrhoea among children treated exclusively in an outpatient setting in greece. methods: during  1999, children with acute diarrhoea who attended the emergency department of our  hospital were prospectively studied. patients requiring hospitalization were excluded. stool specimens were tested microscopically, for bacterial enteropathogens by standard and selective medium cultures and for rotavirus and adenovirus by latex agglutination test. results: one hundred and thirty-two children (median age: 2 years) were included in the study; an enteropathogen was  detected in 63 (48%) of them. isolates included rotavirus (19 patients), salmonella sp (12), campylobacter sp (10), aeromonas sp (9), enteropathogenic escherichia coli (6), adenovirus (6), giardia lamblia (4), yersinia enterocolitica (2) and shigella sp (1). half of the bacterial cases occurred from august to october, and two rotavirus-associated peaks occurred during february and august. acute diarrhoea caused by viruses affected exclusively children under six years of age, mainly those attending day care centres. macroscopic blood in stools was reported only among patients with a bacterial infection. socioeconomic characteristics were not helpful in differentiating disease due to specific enteropathogens. conclusions: bacterial enteropathogens account for a significant proportion of acute diarrhoea in children treated in the outpatient setting in greece. rotavirus is also a frequent cause affecting mostly younger children and  those attending day care centers. the presence of blood in stools and the seasonality of bacterial infections may enable their presumptive diagnosis.

TI  == characterization of saa, a novel autoagglutinating adhesin produced by locus of enterocyte effacement-negative shiga-toxigenic escherichia coli strains that are  virulent for humans.
AB  == the capacity of shiga toxigenic escherichia coli (stec) to adhere to the intestinal mucosa undoubtedly contributes to pathogenesis of human disease. the majority of stec strains isolated from severe cases produce attaching and effacing lesions on the intestinal mucosa, a property mediated by the locus of enterocyte effacement (lee) pathogenicity island. this element is not essential for pathogenesis, as some cases of severe disease, including hemolytic uremic syndrome (hus), are caused by lee-negative stec strains, but the mechanism whereby these adhere to the intestinal mucosa is not understood. we have isolated a gene from the megaplasmid of a lee-negative o113:h21 stec strain (98nk2) responsible for an outbreak of hus, which encodes an auto-agglutinating adhesin designated saa (stec autoagglutinating adhesin). introduction of saa cloned in pbc results in a 9.7-fold increase in adherence of e. coli jm109 to hep-2 cells and a semilocalized adherence pattern. mutagenesis of saa in 98nk2, or curing the wild-type strain of its megaplasmid, resulted in a significant reduction in adherence. homologues of saa were found in several unrelated lee-negative stec serotypes, including o48:h21 (strain 94cr) and o91:h21 (strain b2f1), which were  also isolated from patients with hus. saa exhibits a low degree of similarity (25% amino acid [aa] identity) with yada of yersinia enterocolitica and eib, a recently described phage-encoded immunoglobulin binding protein from e. coli. saa produced by 98nk2 is 516 aa long and includes four copies of a 37-aa direct repeat sequence. interestingly, saa produced by other stec strains ranges in size from 460 to 534 aa as a consequence of variation in the number of repeats and/or  other insertions or deletions immediately proximal to the repeat domain.

AB  == yersinia enterocolitica is an enteric pathogen that has served as a model system  for the study of microbial pathogenesis. numerous virulence gene have been identified both on the virulence plasmid and on the chromosome. one of the chromosomal genes that is highly correlated with virulence is ail, a gene identified along with inv in a screen for y. enterocolitica genes that could confer an invasive phenotype to escherichia coli. ail also promotes serum resistance in both e. coli and y. enterocolitica. several virulence factors homologous to ail have been identified in other pathogens, yet very little is known about what constitutes the functional domain(s) of these proteins. proteins in this family are predicted to consist of eight transmembrane beta-sheets and four cell surface-exposed loops. we constructed and characterized a number of insertion, deletion and point mutations in the regions of ail predicted to encode the cell surface loops. the results from the analysis of these mutants indicate that cell surface loops one and four do not directly promote invasion or serum resistance, whereas mutations in loop three appear to modulate both phenotypes. analysis of mutations in loop 2 suggests that this surface-exposed loop contains  sequences required for serum resistance and invasion. in addition, a peptide derived from the sequence of loop 2 was able specifically to inhibit ail-mediated invasion in a dose-dependent manner. these results suggest that ail directly promotes invasion and that loop 2 contains an active site, perhaps a receptor-binding domain. analyses of the mutations also suggest that the serum resistance and invasion phenotypes may be separable, because there are numerous mutations that affect one phenotype but not the other.

TI  == distribution and structural variation of the she pathogenicity island in enteric  bacterial pathogens.
AB  == shigella flexneri serotype 2a carries a chromosomal pathogenicity island (pai), termed the she pai, that has been implicated in the pathogenesis of diarrhoeal disease. the complete nucleotide sequence and genetic organisation of the she pai of s. flexneri 2a strain ysh6000t was determined recently. in the current study the distribution and structure of the she pai was investigated by pcr and southern analysis in 65 isolates of enteric pathogens including shigella spp., enterohaemorrhagic escherichia coli (ehec), enteropathogenic e. coli (epec), enteroinvasive e. coli (eiec), yersinia enterocolitica and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium. the study showed that the she pai has undergone a variety of structural changes, defined by the presence or absence of specific marker genes in the pai. the she pai or structural variants of this element were found in all  species of shigella as well as in eiec, ehec and epec. no evidence of the pai was found in y. enterocolitica or sal. typhimurium. the structural form of the she pai that exists in strain ysh6000t was present in all strains of s. flexneri serotype 2a and in some strains of s. flexneri serotypes 2b and 3c. variants of the pai that were missing one or more marker regions were found in all species of shigella and in pathogenic strains of e. coli. in all strains, the pais have inserted into either phev or a phe trna gene in another location on the chromosome. it was concluded that the she pai is one of several closely related genetic elements that have disseminated throughout shigella and pathogenic strains of e. coli and diverged into distinct stuctural forms.

TI  == site-directed mutagenesis and phylogenetic comparisons of the escherichia coli tus protein: dna-protein interactions alone can not account for tus activity.
AB  == the tus protein of escherichia coli is capable of arresting dna replication in an orientation-dependent manner when bound to specific sequences in the bacterial chromosome called ter sites. arrest of dna replication has been postulated to occur either by a barrier mechanism, where tus acts as a physical block to replication fork progression, or through protein-protein interactions between tus and some component of the replication fork. a previous mutational analysis of tus suggested that the amino acids in the l1 loop might play a role in replication arrest. site-directed mutagenesis of amino acids in the l1 loop and other amino acid residues on the "non-permissive" face of tus was performed to identify residues that affected tus function. one mutant, e47q, gave results that are inconsistent with the barrier model, showing a greater affinity for the ter site  (with a t 1/2 of 348 min versus 150 min for wild-type tus) but a reduced ability  to arrest dna replication in vivo. in addition to the site-directed mutagenesis studies, the tus genes of salmonella, klebsiella, and yersinia were sequenced and the proteins expressed in e. coli to assess their ability to arrest dna replication. the results presented here support a role for protein-protein interactions in tus function, and suggest that residues e47 and e49 participate in replication fork arrest.

TI  == conserved degp protease in gram-positive bacteria is essential for thermal and oxidative tolerance and full virulence in streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == the degp protease, a multifunctional chaperone and protease, has been shown to be essential for virulence in gram-negative pathogens such as salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, brucella abortus, yersinia enterocolitica, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the function of degp in pathogenesis appears to be the degradation of damaged proteins that accumulate as a result of the initial host response to infection, which includes the release of reactive oxygen intermediates. additionally, the degp protease plays a major role in monitoring and maintaining  the escherichia coli periplasm and influences e. coli pilus biogenesis. we report here the identification of highly homologous enzymes in streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus mutans, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococcus faecalis. moreover, the phenotype of an insertionally inactivated degp allele in s. pyogenes is similar to that reported for e. coli, with temperature sensitivity for growth and enhanced sensitivity to reactive oxygen intermediates. virulence studies in a mouse model of streptococcal infection indicate that a functional degp protease is required for full virulence. these results suggest degp as an attractive broad-spectrum target for future anti-infective drug development.

TI  == evaluation of thin agar layer method for recovery of acid-injured foodborne pathogens.
AB  == the thin agar layer (tal) method of kang and fung was used to enumerate acid-injured foodborne pathogens. this method involves overlaying 14 ml of nonselective medium (tryptic soy agar [tsa]) onto a prepoured and solidified pathogen-specific, selective medium in a petri dish. after surface plating, injured cells resuscitated and grew on tsa during the first few hours of incubation; then, the selective agents from the selective medium diffused to the  top layer, interacted with the recovered microorganisms, and started to produce typical reactions. foodborne pathogens were exposed to 2% acetic acid for 1, 2, or 4 min, and the recovery rate with the tal method was compared with the rate of tsa and pathogen-specific, selective media. no significant difference occurred between tsa and tal (p > 0.05) for enumeration of acid-injured escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella typhimurium, staphylococcus aureus, and yersinia enterocolitica, and both recovered significantly higher numbers than the selective medium for each respective pathogen (p < 0.05). for recovery of acid-injured listeria monocytogenes, no difference (p > 0.05) occurred among tsa, tal, and selective media. however, fewer cells were recovered in the selective media. the tal method is a one-step, convenient procedure for recovery of acid-injured cells.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of essential oils from plants against selected pathogenic  and saprophytic microorganisms.
AB  == the beneficial health effects of extracts from many types of plants that are used as seasoning agents in foods and beverages have been claimed for centuries. the purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of selected herb and spice essential oils for control of growth and survival of microorganisms. inhibition of growth was tested by the paper disc agar diffusion method. antibiotic susceptibility discs were used as control. minimum lethal concentration (mlc) was determined by the tube dilution method. essential oils from anise, angelica, basil, carrot, celery, cardamom, coriander, dill weed, fennel, oregano, parsley,  and rosemary were evaluated. inhibition ranged from complete with oregano to no inhibition with carrot oil for each of the test strains that included: listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli o:157:h7, yersinia enterocolitica, pseudomonas aeruginosa, lactobacillus plantarum, aspergillus niger, geotrichum, and rhodotorula. oregano essential oil showed the greatest inhibition (zone, > or = 70 to 80 mm) (mlc, approximately 8 ppm). coriander and basil were also highly inhibitory (mlc, approximately 25 to 50 ppm) to e. coli o:157:h7 and to the other bacteria and fungi tested. anise oil was not particularly inhibitory to bacteria (inhibition zone, approximately 25 mm); however, anise oil was highly inhibitory to molds. because some of the herbal and spice essential oils are highly inhibitory to selected pathogenic and spoilage microorganisms, they may provide alternatives and supplements to conventional antimicrobial additives in foods.

TI  == genetic characterization of the klebsiella pneumoniae waa gene cluster, involved  in core lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis.
AB  == a recombinant cosmid containing genes involved in klebsiella pneumoniae c3 core lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis was identified by its ability to confer bacteriocin 28b resistance to escherichia coli k-12. the recombinant cosmid contains 12 genes, the whole waa gene cluster, flanked by kbl and coad genes, as  was found in e. coli k-12. pcr amplification analysis showed that this cluster is conserved in representative k. pneumoniae strains. partial nucleotide sequence determination showed that the same genes and gene order are found in k. pneumoniae subsp. ozaenae, for which the core chemical structure is known. complementation analysis of known waa mutants from e. coli k-12 and/or salmonella enterica led to the identification of genes involved in biosynthesis of the inner core backbone that are shared by these three members of the enterobacteriaceae. k. pneumoniae orf10 mutants showed a two-log-fold reduction in a mice virulence assay and a strong decrease in capsule amount. analysis of a constructed k. pneumoniae waae deletion mutant suggests that the waae protein is involved in the transfer of the branch beta-d-glc to the o-4 position of l-glycero-d-manno-heptose i, a feature shared by k. pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and yersinia enterocolitica.

TI  == hrep, an in vivo-expressed protease of yersinia enterocolitica, is a new member of the family of subtilisin/kexin-like proteases.
AB  == the role of proteases in pathogenesis is well established for several microorganisms but has not been described for yersinia enterocolitica. previously, we identified a gene, hrep, which showed significant similarity to proteases in a screen for chromosomal genes of y. enterocolitica that were exclusively expressed during an infection of mice. we cloned this gene by chromosome capture and subsequently determined its nucleotide sequence. like inv, the gene encoding the invasin protein of y. enterocolitica, hrep is located in a  cluster of flagellum biosynthesis and chemotaxis genes. the genomic organization  of this chromosomal region is different in escherichia coli, salmonella, and yersinia pestis than in y. enterocolitica. analysis of the distribution of hrep between different yersinia isolates and the relatively low g+c content of the gene suggests acquisition by horizontal gene transfer. sequence analysis also revealed that hrep belongs to a family of eukaryotic subtilisin/kexin-like proteases. together with the calcium-dependent protease prca of anabaena variabilis, hrep forms a new subfamily of bacterial subtilisin/kexin-like proteases which might have originated from a common eukaryotic ancestor. like other proteases of this family, hrep is expressed with an n-terminal prosequence. expression of an hrep-his(6) tag fusion protein in e. coli revealed that hrep undergoes autocatalytic processing at a consensus cleavage site of subtilisin/kexin-like proteases, thereby releasing the proprotein.

TI  == functional analysis of yersiniabactin transport genes of yersinia enterocolitica.
AB  == yersinia enterocolitica o:8, biogroup (bg) ib, strain wa-c carries a high-pathogenicity island (hpi) including iron-repressible genes (irp1-9, fyua) for biosynthesis and uptake of the siderophore yersiniabactin (ybt). the authors  report the functional analysis of irp6,7,8, which show 98-99% similarity to the corresponding genes ybtp,q,x on the hpi of yersinia pestis. it was demonstrated that irp6,7 are involved in ferric (fe)-ybt utilization and mouse virulence of y. enterocolitica, thus confirming corresponding results for y. pestis. additionally it was shown that inactivation of the ampg-like gene irp8 did not affect either fe-ybt utilization or mouse virulence. to determine whether irp6, irp7 and fyua (encoding the outer-membrane fe-ybt/pesticin receptor fyua) are sufficient to mediate fe-ybt transport/utilization, these genes were transferred into escherichia coli entd,f and into non-pathogenic y. enterocolitica, bg ia, strain  nf-o. surprisingly, e. coli entd,f but not y. enterocolitica nf-o gained the capability to utilize exogenous fe-ybt as a result of this gene transfer, although both strains expressed functional fyua (pesticin sensitivity). these results suggest that besides irp6, irp7 and fyua, additional genes are required for sufficient fe-ybt transport/utilization. finally, it was shown that irp6, irp7 and fyua but not irp8 are involved in controlling ybt biosynthesis and fyua  gene expression: irp6 and/or irp7 mutation leads to upregulation whereas fyua mutation leads to downregulation. however, fyua-dependent control of ybt biosynthesis could be bypassed in a fyua mutant by ingredients of chrome azurol s (cas) siderophore indicator agar.

TI  == use of polymerase chain reaction to identify brucella abortus strain rb51 among brucella field isolates from cattle in italy.
AB  == brucella abortus strain rb51, a rough mutant of the b. abortus 2308 virulent strain, was recently approved in the united states as the official vaccine for brucellosis in cattle. following recent evidence of unauthorized use of rb51 vaccine in italy, where the use of vaccines for brucellosis is no longer allowed, the suitability of an rb51-specific polymerase chain reaction assay for identifying the rb51 strain among brucella field isolates from cattle in italy was investigated. the oligonucleotide primers used in this study, belonging to a  six-primer cocktail for brucella species previously described by other authors, allowed the amplification of a 364-base pair (bp) fragment specific for rb51 and  its parent strain 2308, and a 498-bp product specific for b. abortus. in addition, unresolved bands ranging from 600 to 700 bp were observed from rb51 strain. brucella abortus biovars 1, 2 and 4 have only one specific sensitive 498-bp band. the b. abortus biovars 3, 5 and 6 did not give any signal. the 498-bp product from a reference brucella strain was sequenced and submitted to embl with the accession number aj271969 while the 364-bp fragment from rb51 strain was submitted to embl database with accession number aj271968. the sequence studies confirmed the specificity of the detected fragments. no amplification was obtained by testing dna from strains antigenically related to brucella, such as yersinia enterocolitica o:9, escherichia coli o:157, salmonella urbana and pasteurella multocida. the results of this study indicate that this technique, in combination with specific serological tests, could be a useful diagnostic method to verify the use of rb51 vaccine and can contribute to the creation of a databank of circulating strains.

TI  == characterization of the yersinia pestis yfu abc inorganic iron transport system.
AB  == in yersinia pestis, the causative agent of plague, two inorganic iron transport systems have been partially characterized. the yersiniabactin (ybt) system is a siderophore-dependent transport system required for full virulence. yfe is an abc transport system that accumulates both iron and manganese. we have identified and cloned a y. pestis yfuabc operon. the yfuabc system is a member of the cluster of bacterial abc iron transporters that include sfu of serratia, hit of haemophilus, and yfu of yersinia enterocolitica. the y. pestis kim6+ system is most homologous to that in y. enterocolitica, showing identities of 84% for yfua (periplasmic binding protein), 87% for yfub (inner membrane permease), and 75% for yfuc (atp hydrolase). we constructed a yfuabc promoter-lacz fusion to examine regulation of transcription. this promoter contains a potential fur binding sequence and is iron and fur regulated. significant expression from the yfuabc promoter occurred  during iron-deficient growth conditions. in vitro transcription and translation of a recombinant plasmid encoding yfuabc indicates that yfuabc proteins are expressed. escherichia coli 1017 (an enterobactin-deficient mutant) carrying this plasmid was able to grow in an iron-restrictive complex medium. we constructed a  deletion encompassing the yfuabc promoter and most of yfua. this mutation was introduced into strains with mutations in ybt, yfe, or both systems to examine the role of yfu in iron acquisition in y. pestis. growth of the yfu mutants in a  deferrated, defined medium (pmh2) at 26 and 37 degrees c failed to identify a growth or iron transport defect due to the yfu mutation. fifty percent lethal dose studies in mice did not demonstrate a role for the yfu system in mammalian virulence.

TI  == survival and growth of escherichia coli o157:h7, yersinia enterocolitica and salmonella enteritidis on decontaminated and untreated meat.
AB  == decontamination of meat or carcasses may have an effect in reducing the number of pathogens. recontamination with other pathogens during cutting or packaging may,  however, result in higher growth on decontaminated than on untreated meat due to  the lack of competing non-pathogenic microorganisms. in this study we compared the growth of pathogens during storage at 10 degrees c (worst case condition) on  untreated meat and meat that had been decontaminated by steam vacuuming combined  with spraying with 0.2 m lactic acid. salmonella enteritidis inoculated on chicken multiplied quickly and reached log 7 cfu per cm(2) after 4 days of aerobic storage at 10 degrees c, but growth was not significantly higher on decontaminated than on untreated chicken. the number of yersinia enterocolitica inoculated on decontaminated pork skin reached log 9 cfu per cm(2) after 5 days of aerobic storage at 10 degrees c. overall, growth on vacuum-packed decontaminated and untreated pork under the same conditions was not significantly different, although there tended to be less growth on the untreated samples. the  number of escherichia coli o157:h7 on decontaminated beef increased by nearly 3 log cycles after 5 days of aerobic storage at 10 degrees c compared to only a 1 log cycle increase on untreated beef. for the vacuum-packed beef, growth of e. coli o157:h7 on the fresh meat was very slow, while there was about a 3 log increase on the decontaminated beef. a higher average growth on the decontaminated beef was also found in an experiment with a very low inoculum (27  cfu per cm(2)). during storage of vacuum-packed samples there was multiplication  of e. coli o157:h7 on the decontaminated beef, but virtually none on the untreated beef. this study shows that multiplication of s. enteritidis on chicken and y. enterocolitica on pork skin was not significantly higher on decontaminated compared to untreated meat. the increased multiplication of e. coli o157:h7 on decontaminated beef, especially when vacuum-packed, gives cause for concern. preventive measures might be a strict haccp approach to the handling of the decontaminated meat before packaging or use of a protective culture of lactic acid bacteria.

TI  == molecular characterization of global regulatory rna species that control pathogenicity factors in erwinia amylovora and erwinia herbicola pv. gypsophilae.
AB  == rsmb(ecc) specifies a nontranslatable rna regulator that controls exoprotein production and pathogenicity in soft rot-causing erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora. this effect of rsmb(ecc) rna is mediated mostly by neutralizing the function of rsma(ecc), an rna-binding protein of e. carotovora subsp. carotovora, which acts as a global negative regulator. to determine the occurrence of functional homologs of rsmb(ecc) in non-soft-rot-causing erwinia species, we cloned the rsmb genes of e. amylovora (rsmb(ea)) and e. herbicola pv. gypsophilae (rsmb(ehg)). we show that rsmb(ea) in e. amylovora positively regulates extracellular polysaccharide (eps) production, motility, and pathogenicity. in e. herbicola pv. gypsophilae, rsmb(ehg) elevates the levels of transcripts of a cytokinin (etz) gene and stimulates the production of eps and yellow pigment as well as motility. rsma(ea) and rsma(ehg) have more than 93% identity to rsma(ecc) and, like the latter, function as negative regulators by affecting the transcript stability of the target gene. the rsmb genes reverse the negative effects of rsma(ea), rsma(ehg), and rsma(ecc), but the extent of reversal is highest with homologous combinations of rsm genes. these observations and findings that rsmb(ea) and rsmb(ehg) rna bind rsma(ecc) indicate that the rsmb effect is channeled via rsma. additional support for this conclusion comes from the observation that the rsmb genes are much more effective as positive regulators in a rsma(+) strain of e. carotovora subsp. carotovora than in its rsma(-) derivative. e. herbicola pv. gypsophilae produces a 290-base rsmb transcript that is not subject to processing. by contrast, e. amylovora produces 430- and 300-base rsmb transcripts, the latter presumably derived by processing of the primary transcript as previously noted with the transcripts of rsmb(ecc). southern blot hybridizations revealed the presence of rsmb homologs in e. carotovora, e. chrysanthemi, e. amylovora, e. herbicola, e. stewartii and e. rhapontici, as well as in other enterobacteria such as escherichia coli, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, serratia marcescens, shigella flexneri,  enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, yersinia enterocolitica, and y. pseudotuberculosis. a comparison of rsmb sequences from several of these enterobacterial species revealed a highly conserved 34-mer region which is predicted to play a role in positive regulation by rsmb rna.

AB  == a new nutrient medium for isolation and cultivation of the causative agents of enteric yersiniosis and pseudotuberculosis was found to have advantages over endo medium in its differentiating and inhibiting properties. this medium permitted the easy differentiation of yersinia pseudotuberculosis from y. enterocolitica, as well as from escherichia coli, shigella flexneri, klebsiella pneumoniae, k. rhinoscleromatis, hafnia, enterobacter and citrobacter by color; from proteus inconstans by swarming. in addition, weakly swarming of p. vulgaris differed by their light bluish color and pseudomonas aeruginosa, by the brilliance and size of colonies. endo medium could be used only for differentiation of e. coli from lactose-negative yersinia colonies, klebsiella (by mucous growth) and, to a certain extent, all proteus species (by swarming). the medium under test and the  control medium inhibited the growth of staphylococcus aureus. in contrast to endo medium, the medium under test partially inhibited the growth of k. rhinoscleromatis and the swarming of p. inconstans. the new medium is now introduced into practice.

AB  == the biosynthetic genes pchdcba and pchef, which are known to be required for the  formation of the siderophore pyochelin and its precursors salicylate and dihydroaeruginoate (dha), are clustered with the pchr regulatory gene on the chromosome of pseudomonas aeruginosa. the 4.6-kb region located downstream of the pchef genes was found to contain three additional, contiguous genes, pchg, pchh,  and pchi, probably forming a pchefghi operon. the deduced amino acid sequences of pchh and pchi are similar to those of atp binding cassette transport proteins with an export function. pchg is a homolog of the yersinia pestis and y. enterocolitica proteins ybtu and irp3, which are involved in the biosynthesis of  yersiniabactin. a null mutation in pchg abolished pyochelin formation, whereas mutations in pchh and pchi did not affect the amounts of salicylate, dha, and pyochelin produced. the pyochelin biosynthetic genes were expressed from a vector promoter, uncoupling them from fur-mediated repression by iron and pchr-dependent induction by pyochelin. in a p. aeruginosa mutant lacking the entire pyochelin biosynthetic gene cluster, the expressed pchdcba and pchefg genes were sufficient for salicylate, dha, and pyochelin production. pyochelin formation was also obtained in the heterologous host escherichia coli expressing pchdcba and pchefg  together with the e. coli entd gene, which provides a phosphopantetheinyl transferase necessary for pche and pchf activation. the pchg protein was purified and used in combination with pchd and phosphopantetheinylated pche and pchf in vitro to produce pyochelin from salicylate, l-cysteine, atp, nadph, and s-adenosylmethionine. based on this assay, a reductase function was attributed to pchg. in summary, this study completes the identification of the biosynthetic genes required for pyochelin formation from chorismate in p. aeruginosa.

AB  == the gene encoding periplasmic 2',3'-cyclic phosphodiesterase in yersinia enterocolitica o:8 (designated cpdb), was cloned and expressed in escherichia coli. this enzyme enables y. enterocolitica to grow on 2',3'-camp as a sole source of carbon and energy. sequencing and analysis of a 3 kb eco:ri fragment containing the cpdb gene revealed an open reading frame of 1179 bp, corresponding to a protein with a molecular mass of 71 kda. the first 25 amino acid residues show features of a typical prokaryotic signal sequence. the predicted molecular mass of the mature peptide is therefore in agreement with the molecular mass estimated by sds gel electrophoresis (68 kda). the putative cpdb promoter region  contains two possible -10 and -35 regions. furthermore, the 5' untranslated region contains sequences with significant homology to the cyclic amp-cyclic amp  receptor protein binding site and the sigma(28) consensus. this region is interrupted by an enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (eric) sequence. deletion of the eric element from the cpdb promoter region had no effect on cpdb expression. in the 3' untranslated region, a possible rho-independent transcriptional terminator was identified. the deduced amino acid sequence of the y. enterocolitica cpdb protein shows 76% identity with cpdb of salmonella typhimurium and e. coli. cpdb of y. enterocolitica is exported to the  periplasmic space. an isogenic y. enterocolitica cpdb mutant strain, constructed  by allelic exchange, was no longer able to grow on 2',3'-camp as sole source of carbon and energy. the cpdb mutant showed no significant change in virulence in an oral and intravenous mouse infection model.

AB  == background: many investigations of the relationship between ulcerative colitis (uc) and heat-shock protein (hsp) 60 have been reported. we have already established an animal model exhibiting uc-like lesions caused by administration of escherichia coli expressing yersinia enterocolitica hsp60. in this study, we therefore attempted to induce mouse colitis by purified y. enterocolitica hsp60.  methods: purified y. enterocolitica hsp60 was injected intraperitoneally into b10a/sgsn mice at a dose of 3 microg/0.2 ml once a week for 2 months, and morphological changes in the intestine were examined by light and electron microscopical analysis. autoimmune responses were also examined. results: the mice treated with y. enterocolitica hsp60 exhibited immune reaction between large intestine and autologous serum. light and electron microscopically, degradation of glandular ducts, erosions, ulceration, crypt abscess-like formation, infiltration of inflammatory cells and absence of perivascular reticular fibers in lamina propria mucosae and subepithelial reticular layer were observed. conclusions: these findings indicate that administration of y. enterocolitica hsp60 induces uc-like lesions with autoimmune responses.

TI  == low-dose irradiation as a measure to improve microbial quality of ice cream.
AB  == the present study was undertaken to investigate the efficacy of low-dose irradiation to improve the microbial safety of ice cream. initially three different flavors (vanilla, strawberry and chocolate) of ice cream were exposed,  at -72 degrees c, to doses of 1, 2, 5, 10 and 30 kgy to gamma-radiation. irradiation at 1 kgy resulted in reduction of microbial population by one log cycle, thus meeting the requirement limits prescribed by bureau of indian standards. pathogens such as listeria monocytogenes 036, yersinia enterocoliticta 5692 and escherichia coli o157:h19, respectively, showed the d10 values 0.38, 0.15 and 0.2 kgy in ice cream at -72 degrees c suggesting the efficacy of low doses (1 kgy) in eliminating them. sensory evaluation studies of ice cream irradiated at 1, 2, 3 and 5 kgy by a 15 member panel demonstrated that doses higher than 2 kgy irradiation induced off-odour and an aftertaste was evident in  vanilla ice cream. a radiation dose of 1 kgy was sufficient to eliminate the natural number of pathogens present in the ice cream. no statistically significant differences were observed in the sensory attributes of all the three  flavours of ice cream either unirradiated or exposed to 1 kgy (p < 0.05).

TI  == the psp locus of yersinia enterocolitica is required for virulence and for growth in vitro when the ysc type iii secretion system is produced.
AB  == the phage shock protein locus (pspfpspabcde) of escherichia coli has proved to be something of an enigma since its discovery. the physiological functions of the psp locus, including those of the predicted effector protein pspa, are unknown. in a previous genetic screen, we determined that a yersinia enterocolitica pspc mutant was severely attenuated for virulence. in this study, the psp locus of y.  enterocolitica was characterized further. the pspc gene of y. enterocolitica was  found to be important for normal growth when the ysc type iii secretion system was expressed in the laboratory. this growth defect was specifically caused by production of the secretin protein, yscc. expression of the psp genes was induced when the type iii secretion system was functional or when only the yscc gene was  expressed. this induction of psp gene expression required a functional pspc gene. most significantly, evidence suggests that the expression of at least one gene that is not part of the psp locus is regulated by psp proteins. this unidentified gene (or genes) may also be important for growth when the type iii secretion system is expressed. these conclusions are supported by the effects of various psp mutations on virulence. this is the first indication that psp proteins might  be involved in the regulation of genes besides the psp locus itself.

TI  == infections in e-beta thalassemia.
AB  == infection is a major complication and the leading cause of death in thalassemia,  especially e-beta thalassemia. the spectrum of infections in e-beta thalassemia include mild and severe infections, therapy-related infections such as yersinia enterocolitica infection associated with desferrioxamine (dfo) therapy, and transfusion-transmitted disease, as well as unique infections such as with pythiosis. prospective studies in thailand indicate that patients with e-beta thalassemia had more frequent episodes of both mild and severe infections. the former included upper respiratory tract infection, acute gastroenteritis, cutaneous abscess, and gingivitis. severe infections occurred more commonly in patients with splenectomy and included septicemia, pneumonia, biliary tract infection, salmonellosis, and urinary tract infection. responsible organisms were escherichia coli (26%), klebsiella pneumoniae (23%), salmonella (15%), and streptococcus pneumoniae (13%). other organisms included pseudomonas, staphylococci, burkholderia pseudomallei (melioidosis), and aeromonas. patients undergoing dfo therapy are at risk for y. enterocolitica infection which may be localized to mesenteric nodes and tonsils or occur as a generalized form such as  septicemia. recently, we have seen a unique infection so-called vascular pythiosis. patients usually presented with clinical features of vascular occlusion of lower limbs from ascending arteritis and thrombosis. the causative organism, pythium insidiosum, is fungus-like, in the kingdom stramenopila, and in the class oomycetes. the mortality rate is high and the only effective treatment  has been early amputation or possibly immunotherapy. the predisposing factors of  infections in thalassemia include splenectomy, iron overload, anemia, and granulocyte dysfunctions. general management of infections in thalassemia consist of prevention, i.e., immunization with pneumococcal and hepatitis vaccines, oral  penicillins especially in patients with splenectomy, removal of predisposing factors such as gallstones, iron overload, and appropriate antibiotics.

TI  == dendritic cell function is perturbed by yersinia enterocolitica infection in vitro.
AB  == infection with yersinia enterocolitica is the cause of intestinal or extraintestinal diseases. we investigated the role of dendritic cells (dc), the most potent antigen-presenting cell (apc), in the course of infection with y. enterocolitica in vitro. for these studies, dc were isolated from human peripheral blood and infected with green fluorescent protein (gfp)-labelled y. enterocolitica. bacteria were found within dc by facs analysis and viable bacteria could be cultured from lysed cells. within 24 h after infection, dc upregulated cd83 and cd86 followed at day 3, indicating maturation of dc. in contrast, for mhc class ii, a marked but transient downregulation was observed at day 3 after infection, and downregulation to a lesser extent for cd80 at day 5. to assess the immunostimulatory capacity of dc, viable infected and uninfected dc were incubated with autologous t cells in the presence of phytohemagglutinin a (pha). t cell proliferation was significantly reduced at days 4-6 after infection but not thereafter, whereas nonpathogenic escherichia coli was not able to mimick this suppressive effect of y. enterocolitica. the same suppression could be observed when infected dc were used in a mixed leucocyte reaction with allogeneic t cells. thus y. enterocolitica is able to invade dc, does not induce necrosis or apoptosis, but affects maturation of dc. however, mhc class ii-molecules are downregulated initially, which coincides with a diminished immunostimulatory capacity of dc infected with y. enterocolitica. the diminished immunostimulatory  capacity of dc following infection with y. enterocolitica in vitro might impair or delay elimination of bacteria thereby contributing to pathogenesis of bacterial enteritis or extraintestinal manifestations such as reactive arthritis.

TI  == uptake pathways of clinical and healthy animal isolates of campylobacter jejuni into int-407 cells.
AB  == campylobacter jejuni isolates obtained from human and animal sources showed different invasion levels into human embryonic intestinal (int-407) cells. there  was no significant relation between the degree of invasion and cytotoxins production. the depolymerization of both microfilaments by cytochalasin-d and microtubules by colchicine, demecolcine and nocodazole or stabilization of microtubules by paclitaxel reduced the invasiveness of c. jejuni, although microfilament depolymerization showed greater inhibition than microtubule depolymerization. interference with receptor-mediated endocytosis by g-strophanthin and monodansylcadaverine and inhibition of endosome acidification  by monensin reduced the number of viable intracellular c. jejuni cells. furthermore inhibition of only host protein kinases by staurosporine, but not phosphoinositide 3-kinase by wortmannin or protein kinase-c by calphostin-c, significantly reduced invasion of epithelial cells by c. jejuni. these data suggest that the internalization mechanism triggered by c. jejuni is strikingly different from the microfilament-dependent invasion mechanism exhibited by many of the well-studied enteric bacteria such as enteroinvasive strains of escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, shigella flexneri, yersinia enterocolitica and yersinia pseudotuberculosis.

AB  == mixed infection with rotavirus and either yersinia enterocolitica or y. pseudotuberculosis was analysed in caco-2 cells, an enterocyte-like cell line highly susceptible to these pathogens. results showed an increase of bacterial adhesion and internalisation in rotavirus-infected cells. increased internalisation was also seen with escherichia coli strain hb101 (pri203), harbouring the inv gene from y. pseudotuberculosis, which is involved in the invasion process of host cells. in contrast, the superinfection with bacteria of  caco-2 cells pre-infected with rotavirus resulted in decreased viral antigen synthesis. transmission electron microscopy confirmed the dual infection of enterocytes. these data suggest that rotavirus infection enhances the early interaction between host cell surfaces and enteroinvasive yersinia spp.

TI  == comparison between the growth of yersinia enterocolitica, listeria monocytogenes, escherichia coli o157:h7 and salmonella spp. in ground beef packed by three commercially used packaging techniques.
AB  == growth of the pathogens yersinia enterocolitica, listeria monocytogenes, escherichia coli o157:h7 and strains of salmonella were compared in ground beef packed in modified atmospheres of 60% co2/40% n2/0.4% co (high co2/low co mixture), 70% o2/30% co2 (high o2 mixture) and in chub packs (stuffed in plastic  casings). the ground beef was inoculated with rifampicin-resistant or nalidixic acid/streptomycin-resistant strains of the pathogens (final concentration 10(2) - 10(3) bacteria/g) and stored at 4 and 10 degrees c for up to 14 days. at 4 degrees c the shelf life, based on colour stability and background flora development, was prolonged for the high co2/low co mixture compared to the two other packaging methods, but at 10 degrees c the shelf life was < 8 days for all  the packaging methods. growth of y. enterocolitica was nearly totally inhibited both at 4 and 10 degrees c in the high co2/low co mixture, while the bacterial numbers in the samples packed in the high o2 mixture increased from about 5 x 10(2) bacteria/g at day 0 to about 10(4) at day 5 at 4 degrees c and to 10(5) at  10 degrees c. growth in the chub packs was even higher. l. monocytogenes showed very little growth at 4 degrees c in all treatments. at 10 degrees c there was slow growth from about 5 x 10(3) bacteria/g to about 10(4) at day 5 in the high co2/low co mixture, while the numbers in the high o2 mixture and the chub packs were about 10 times higher. growth of e. coli o157:h7 at 10 degrees c in the ground beef was nearly totally inhibited in both the high co2/low co mixture and  the high o2 mixture. growth in the chub packs was higher, as the number of bacteria increased 3 log in 5 days. the salmonella strains (s. typhimurium, s. dublin, s. enteritidis and s. enterica 61:k:1,5,(7)) in the ground beef stored at 10 degrees c for 5 and 7 days grew to a higher number in the high co2/low co mixture than in the high o2 mixture. this study shows that the growth of y. enterocolitica and l. mononcytogenes in ground beef stored in the high co2 /low co mixture was not increased as a result of prolonging the shelf life. however, the observed growth of strains of salmonella at 10 degrees c in this mixture and  in chub packs does emphasise the importance of temperature control during storage.

TI  == structural model requirements to describe microbial inactivation during a mild heat treatment.
AB  == the classical concept of d and z values, established for sterilisation processes, is unable to deal with the typical non-loglinear behaviour of survivor curves occurring during the mild heat treatment of sous vide or cook-chill food products. structural model requirements are formulated, eliminating immediately some candidate model types. promising modelling approaches are thoroughly analysed and, if applicable, adapted to the specific needs: two models developed  by casolari (1988), the inactivation model of sapru et al. (1992), the model of whiting (1993), the baranyi and roberts growth model (1994), the model of chiruta et al. (1997), the model of daughtry et al. (1997) and the model of xiong et al.  (1999). a range of experimental data of bacillus cereus, yersinia enterocolitica, escherichia coli o157:h7, listeria monocytogenes and lactobacillus sake are used  to illustrate the different models' performances. moreover, a novel modelling approach is developed, fulfilling all formulated structural model requirements, and based on a careful analysis of literature knowledge of the shoulder and tailing phenomenon. although a thorough insight in the occurrence of shoulders and tails is still lacking from a biochemical point of view, this newly developed model incorporates the possibility of a straightforward interpretation within this framework.

TI  == characterization and expression of hmur, a tonb-dependent hemoglobin receptor of  porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == the gram-negative pathogen porphyromonas gingivalis requires hemin for growth. hemoglobin bound to haptoglobin and hemin complexed to hemopexin can be used as heme sources, indicating that p. gingivalis must have a means to remove the hemin from these host iron-binding proteins. however, the specific mechanisms utilized  by p. gingivalis for the extraction of heme from heme-binding proteins and for iron transport are poorly understood. in this study we have determined that a newly identified tonb-dependent hemoglobin-hemin receptor (hmur) is involved in hemoglobin binding and utilization in p. gingivalis a7436. hmur shares amino acid homology with tonb-dependent outer membrane receptors of gram-negative bacteria involved in the acquisition of iron from hemin and hemoglobin, including hemr of  yersinia enterocolitica, shua of shigella dysenteriae, hpub of neisseria gonorrhoeae and n. meningitidis, hmbr of n. meningitidis, hgba of haemophilus ducreyi, and hgpb of h. influenzae. southern blot analysis confirmed the presence of the hmur gene and revealed genetic variability in the carboxy terminus of hmur in p. gingivalis strains 33277, 381, w50, and 53977. we also identified directly  upstream of the hmur gene a gene which we designated hmuy. upstream of the hmuy start codon, a region with homology to the fur binding consensus sequence was identified. reverse transcription-pcr analysis revealed that hmur and hmuy were cotranscribed and that transcription was negatively regulated by iron. inactivation of hmur resulted in a decreased ability of p. gingivalis to bind hemoglobin and to grow with hemoglobin or hemin as sole iron sources. escherichia coli cells expressing recombinant hmur were shown to bind hemoglobin and hemin. furthermore, purified recombinant hmur was demonstrated to bind hemoglobin. taken together, these results indicate that hmur serves as the major tonb-dependent outer membrane receptor involved in the utilization of both hemin and hemoglobin  in p. gingivalis.

TI  == delivery of protein antigens and dna by virulence-attenuated strains of salmonella typhimurium and listeria monocytogenes.
AB  == two different plasmid-vector systems were developed which allow the efficient production and presentation of protein antigens in antigen-presenting cells (apc) by means of virulence-attenuated bacteria. the first antigen-delivery system is based on the secretion machinery of the escherichia coli hemolysin (hlya-type i secretion system), which transports proteins, possessing the specific hlya secretion signal (hlya(s)) at the c-terminus, across both membranes of gram-negative bacteria. this system functions in all gram-negative bacteria that  possess the tolc-analogous protein in the outer membrane. this outer membrane protein is necessary for the stable anchoring of the type i secretion apparatus in the cell envelope. suitable hlya(s)-fused antigens are secreted with high efficiency by e. coli and by virulence-attenuated strains of salmonella, shigella, vibrio cholerae and yersinia enterocolitica. the other vector system expresses the heterologous antigen under the control of an eukaryotic promoter in a similar fashion as in plasmids commonly used for vaccination with naked dna. this plasmid dna is introduced into apcs with the help of virulence-attenuated self-destructing listeria monocytogenes mutants. after synthesis of the heterologous protein, epitopes of the antigen are presented by the apc together with mhc class i molecules. this system functions in macrophages and dendritic cells in vitro and can also be used in a modified form in animal models.

TI  == yersinia enterocolitica clpb affects levels of invasin and motility.
AB  == expression of the yersinia enterocolitica inv gene is dependent on growth phase and temperature. inv is maximally expressed at 23 degrees c in late-exponential-  to early-stationary-phase cultures. we previously reported the isolation of a y.  enterocolitica mutant (jb1a8v) that shows a decrease in invasin levels yet is hypermotile when grown at 23 degrees c. jb1a8v has a transposon insertion within  uvrc. described here is the isolation and characterization of a clone that suppresses these mutant phenotypes of the uvrc mutant jb1a8v. this suppressing clone encodes clpb (a clp atpase homologue). the y. enterocolitica clpb homologue is 30 to 40% identical to the clpb proteins from various bacteria but is 80% identical to one of the two clpb homologues of yersinia pestis. a clpb::tnmax2 insertion mutant (jb69qv) was constructed and determined to be deficient in invasin production and nonmotile when grown at 23 degrees c. analysis of inv and  fleb (flagellin gene) transcript levels in jb69qv suggested that clpb has both transcriptional and posttranscriptional effects. in contrast, a clpb null mutant, by1v, had no effect on invasin levels or motility. a model accounting for these observations is presented.

AB  == bacteriophage phiyeo3-12 is a lytic phage of yersinia enterocolitica serotype o:3. the phage receptor is the lipopolysaccharide o chain of this serotype that consists of the rare sugar 6-deoxy-l-altropyranose. a one-step growth curve of phiyeo3-12 revealed eclipse and latent periods of 15 and 25 min, respectively, with a burst size of about 120 pfu per infected cell. in electron microscopy phiyeo3-12 virions showed pentagonal outlines, indicating their icosahedral nature. the phage capsid was shown to be composed of at least 10 structural proteins, of which a protein of 43 kda was predominant. n-terminal sequences of three structural proteins were determined, two of them showing strong homology to structural proteins of coliphages t3 and t7. the phage genome was found to consist of a double-stranded dna molecule of 40 kb without cohesive ends. a physical map of the phage dna was constructed using five restriction enzymes. the phage infection could be effectively neutralized using serum from a rabbit immunized with whole phiyeo3-12 particles. the antiserum also neutralized t3 infection, although not as efficiently as that of phiyeo3-12. phiyeo3-12 was found to share, in addition to the n-terminal sequence homology, several common features with t3, including morphology and nonsubjectibility to f exclusion. the  evidence conclusively indicated that phiyeo3-12 is the first close relative of phage t3 to be described.

TI  == microbiological safety of mayonnaise, salad dressings, and sauces produced in the united states: a review.
AB  == the literature on the death and survival of foodborne pathogens in commercial mayonnaise, dressing, and sauces was reviewed and statistically analyzed with emphasis on salmonella, escherichia coli o157:h7, and listeria monocytogenes. the absence of reports of foodborne illness associated directly with the consumption  of commercially prepared acidic dressings and sauces is evidence of their safety. salmonella, e. coli o157:h7, e. coli, l. monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, and yersinia enterocolitica die when inoculated into mayonnaise and dressings. historically, mayonnaise and dressings have been exempt from the acidified food regulations and have justly deserved this status due primarily to the toxic effect of acetic and to a lesser extent lactic and citric acids. these organic acids are inimical to pathogenic bacteria and are effective natural preservatives with acetic being the most effective in killing pathogenic bacteria at the ph values encountered in these products. statistical analysis on data reported in the literature shows that the most important and significant factor in destroying pathogenic bacteria is ph as adjusted with acetic acid followed by the concentration of acetic acid in the water phase. the reported highest manufacturing target ph for dressings and sauces is 4.4, which is below the 4.75  pka of acetic acid and below the reported inhibitory ph of 4.5 for foodborne pathogens in the presence of acetic acid. the overall conclusion is that these products are very safe. they should remain exempt from the acidified food regulations providing adequate research has been done to validate their safety, and the predominant acid is acetic and reasonable manufacturing precautions are taken.

TI  == yersinia enterocolitica invasin protein triggers il-8 production in epithelial cells via activation of rel p65-p65 homodimers.
AB  == enteropathogenic yersinia bacteria trigger the production of the proinflammatory  chemokine il-8, an important chemokine for the recruitment of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (pmn). yersinia is resistant to phagocytosis by pmn, and the recruitment of these cells is thought to be part of a pathogenic strategy of yersinia to establish infection by allowing the pathogen to gain access to, and disseminate within, host tissue. we report here that yersinia expressing the outer membrane protein invasin triggers il-8 production in epithelial cells. the  195 carboxyl-terminal amino acids of invasin when linked to latex beads are sufficient to trigger il-8 production. by means of il-8 promoter reporter gene assays and electrophoretic mobility shift assay experiments, the minimal optimal  region of the il-8 promoter responsive to invasin was identified and invasin-responsive control elements were characterized. invasin-induced activation of the il-8 promoter was found to be mediated through a previously identified nf-kappab element. this nf-kappab binding site preferentially binds rel p65-p65 homodimers as well as some p50-p65 heterodimers in response to stimulation by invasin. invasin-induced nf-kappab activation correlated with degradation of ikappabalpha and the inhibition of nf-kappab by specific inhibitors of ikappab activation blocked invasin-induced il-8 secretion. invasin-triggered il-8 production does not depend on invasin-triggered uptake of  bacteria, and is independent of a functional pi3-kinase. this report is the first to demonstrate the molecular basis of il-8 production triggered by enteropathogenic bacteria. together, these data elucidate the possible early pathomechanisms operating in yersinia infection and may have implications for the design of novel therapeutics directed against this enteropathogen.

TI  == pseudomonas syringae hrp type iii secretion system and effector proteins.
AB  == pseudomonas syringae is a member of an important group of gram-negative bacterial pathogens of plants and animals that depend on a type iii secretion system to inject virulence effector proteins into host cells. in p. syringae, hrp/hrc genes encode the hrp (type iii secretion) system, and avirulence (avr) and hrp-dependent outer protein (hop) genes encode effector proteins. the hrp/hrc genes of p. syringae pv syringae 61, p. syringae pv syringae b728a, and p. syringae pv tomato dc3000 are flanked by an exchangeable effector locus and a conserved effector locus in a tripartite mosaic hrp pathogenicity island (pai) that is linked to a trna(leu) gene found also in pseudomonas aeruginosa but without linkage to hrp system genes. cosmid phir11 carries a portion of the strain 61 hrp pathogenicity island that is sufficient to direct escherichia coli  and pseudomonas fluorescens to inject hoppsya into tobacco cells, thereby eliciting a hypersensitive response normally triggered only by plant pathogens. large deletions in strain dc3000 revealed that the conserved effector locus is essential for pathogenicity but the exchangeable effector locus has only a minor  role in growth in tomato. p. syringae secretes hoppsya and avrpto in culture in a hrp-dependent manner at ph and temperature conditions associated with pathogenesis. avrpto is also secreted by yersinia enterocolitica. the secretion of avrpto depends on the first 15 codons, which are also sufficient to direct the secretion of an npt reporter from y. enterocolitica, indicating that a universal  targeting signal is recognized by the type iii secretion systems of both plant and animal pathogens.

TI  == motility is required to initiate host cell invasion by yersinia enterocolitica.
AB  == invasin-mediated invasion of host cells by the pathogen yersinia enterocolitica was shown to be affected by flagellar-dependent motility. motility appears to be  required to ensure the bacterium migrates to and contacts the host cell. nonmotile strains of y. enterocolitica were less invasive than motile strains, but the reduction in invasion could be overcome by artificially bringing the bacteria into host cell contact by centrifugation. mutations in known regulatory  genes of the flagellar regulon, flhdc and flia, resulted in less inv expression but did not have a significant effect on invasin levels. however, invasin levels  were reduced for strains that harbored flhdc on a multicopy plasmid, apparently as a result of increased proteolysis of invasin.

TI  == an immunoglobulin superfamily-like domain unique to the yersinia pseudotuberculosis invasin protein is required for stimulation of bacterial uptake via integrin receptors.
AB  == the binding of the yersinia pseudotuberculosis and yersinia enterocolitica invasin proteins to beta(1) integrin receptors allows internalization of these organisms by cultured cells. the c-terminal 192-residue superdomain of the y. pseudotuberculosis invasin is necessary and sufficient for integrin recognition,  while a region located outside, and n-terminal to, this superdomain strongly enhances the efficiency of bacterial uptake. within the enhancer region is a domain called d2 that allows invasin-invasin interaction. to investigate the role of the enhancer region, bacterial cell binding and entry mediated by the y. pseudotuberculosis invasin protein (invasin(pstb)) was compared to that of y. enterocolitica invasin (invasin(ent)), which lacks the d2 self-association domain. invasin(ent) was shown to be unable to promote self-interaction, using the dna binding domain of lambda repressor as a reporter. furthermore, two genetically engineered in-frame deletion mutations that removed d2 from invasin(pstb) were significantly less proficient than wild-type invasin(pstb) at  promoting uptake, although the amount of surface-exposed invasin as well as the cell binding capacity of the recombinant escherichia coli strains remained similar. competitive uptake assays showed that e. coli cells expressing invasin(pstb) had a significant advantage in the internalization process versus either e. coli cells expressing invasin(ent) or the invasin(pstb) derivatives deleted for d2, further demonstrating the importance of invasin self-interaction  for the efficiency of invasin-mediated uptake.

TI  == yersinia enterocolitica invasin protein triggers differential production of interleukin-1, interleukin-8, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and tumor necrosis factor alpha in epithelial cells: implications for understanding the early cytokine network in yersinia infections.
AB  == yersinia enterocolitica infection of epithelial cells results in interleukin-8 (il-8) mrna expression. herein we demonstrate that besides il-8, increased mrna levels of five other cytokines, il-1alpha, il-1beta, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (mcp-1), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (gm-csf), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha), can be detected upon infection of hela cells with yersinia. yersinia-triggered cytokine production was not affected by blocking phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate kinase with wortmannin, which inhibited bacterial invasion. comparable cytokine mrna responses were triggered by escherichia coli expressing yersinia inv, while no response was triggered by an inv-deficient yersinia mutant. moreover, cytokine responses were independent from metabolic activity of the bacteria, as killed bacterial cells were sufficient for triggering cytokine responses in hela cells. semiquantitative reverse transcription-pcr analysis was used to assess the kinetics of cytokine mrna expression in infected hela cells. il-8, il-1alpha, il-1beta, mcp-1, gm-csf, and  tnf-alpha mrna expression increased within 1 h postinfection, reached a maximum after 3 to 4 h, and then declined to preinfection levels within 3 h. il-8, mcp-1, and gm-csf were secreted by hela cells, whereas il-1alpha and il-1beta were not secreted and thus were found exclusively intracellularly. tnf-alpha protein could not be detected in cell lysates or supernatants. stimulation of hela cells with il-1alpha was followed by increased il-8 mrna expression, whereas stimulation with il-8 did not induce cytokine production. likewise, mcp-1 and gm-csf did not  induce significant cytokine responses in hela cells. our results implicate that the initial host response to yersinia infection might be sustained by il-8, mcp-1, and gm-csf produced by epithelial cells.

TI  == studies on the interactions of immunostimulated macrophages and yersinia enterocolitica o:8.
AB  == immunological and electron microscopy investigations of the phagocytic and killing activities of peritoneal macrophages from rats and mice against yersinia  enterocolitica serotype o:8 cells were performed. the effect of in vivo application of cytoplasmic membranes (cm) from the stable escherichia coli wf+ l-form on macrophage activity was also studied. it was established that rat macrophages more actively phagocytosed the plasmidless pyv(-) y. enterocolitica cells, compared to the plasmid-bearing pyv(+) y. enterocolitica cells. the killing ability against both variants of the y. enterocolitica strain was significantly enhanced in macrophages from cm-treated rats after 2 h, 4 h, and 24 h incubation. the cm treatment enhanced the phagocytic activity of the macrophages. the in vitro interaction of normal and immunostimulated rat macrophages with both pyv(+) and pyv(-) variants of y. enterocolitica did not lead to any additional apoptotic and necrotic changes in macrophages compared to  control macrophages, which were cultivated without y. enterocolitica. electron-microscopic investigation showed that mouse macrophages eliminated y. enterocolitica pyv(+) cells in vivo after 24 h. no engulfed or digested bacterial cells were observed. activation of cell surfaces and vacuolization of macrophage  cytoplasm, both of cm-treated non-infected and infected mice, were observed. the  experimental results showed that y. enterocolitica pyv(+) cells could be eliminated by peritoneal macrophages.

TI  == the yersinia enterocolitica phospholipase gene ypla is part of the flagellar regulon.
AB  == yersinia enterocolitica ypla encodes a phospholipase required for virulence. virulence genes are often regulated in response to environmental signals; therefore, ypla expression was examined using a ypla::laczy transcriptional fusion. maximal ypla expression occurred between ph 6.5 and ph 7.5 and was induced in the mid-logarithmic growth phase. potential fnr, cyclic amp (camp)-camp receptor protein (crp), and sigma(f) regulatory sites were identified in the nucleotide sequence. reduction of ypla expression by aeration, addition of glucose and sucrose, and application of high temperature and salt is consistent with fnr-, camp-crp-, and sigma(f)-mediated regulation, respectively. expression  of ypla was reduced in flhdc and flia null strains, indicating that ypla is part  of the flagellar regulon.

TI  == cell surface presentation of recombinant (poly-) peptides including functional t-cell epitopes by the aida autotransporter system.
AB  == for the efficient surface presentation and release of virulence factors especially pathogenic gram-negative bacteria have developed several distinct secretion mechanisms. an increasing number of pathogens in various species employs a mechanism denoted the 'autotransporter' pathway. this pathway is characterised by an outer membrane translocator module representing the c-terminal domain of the transported protein itself. an intriguing potential application of such systems involves the transport and surface expression of recombinant proteins or peptides, like e.g. the presentation of antigens for the  generation of live oral vectors as vaccine carriers. here we report on the incorporation of heterologous (poly-) peptides in permissive sites of the translocator module of the adhesin-involved-in-diffuse-adherence (aida) autotransporter system. we demonstrate the presentation of the b subunit of the heat labile enterotoxin of escherichia coli (ltb) as well as of functional t-cell epitopes of yersinia enterocolitica heat-shock protein 60 (y-hsp60) on the surface of e. coli.

TI  == identification of a streptogramin a acetyltransferase gene in the chromosome of yersinia enterocolitica.
AB  == streptogramins are polypeptide antibiotics inhibiting protein synthesis by the prokaryotic ribosome. gram-positive organisms are susceptible to streptogramins,  while most gram-negative bacteria are intrinsically resistant. we have found a genomic fragment from a yersinia enterocolitica isolate with an open reading frame coding for a polypeptide similar to the virginiamycin acetyltransferases found in various plasmids from gram-positive bacteria. the susceptible escherichia coli strain db10 was transformed to resistance to the type a streptogramins and to mixed (a + b) streptogramins upon introduction of a plasmid containing that gene. in addition, we showed streptogramin acetylating activity in vitro dependent on the presence of the y. enterocolitica sat gene. southern blot hybridization experiments showed that the sat gene was present in all the y. enterocolitica isolates examined. these data together show that the gene in the y. enterocolitica chromosome encoded an active streptogramin acetyltransferase. the deduced sequence of the y. enterocolitica sat protein was close to those of sat gene products found in gram-positive bacteria and cyanobacteria, suggesting a common evolutionary origin.

TI  == biochemical sequence analyses of ges-1, a novel class a extended-spectrum beta-lactamase, and the class 1 integron in52 from klebsiella pneumoniae.
AB  == klebsiella pneumoniae ori-1 was isolated in 1998 in france from a rectal swab of  a 1-month-old girl who was previously hospitalized in cayenne hospital, cayenne,  french guiana. this strain harbored a ca. 140-kb nontransferable plasmid, ptk1, that conferred an extended-spectrum cephalosporin resistance profile antagonized  by the addition of clavulanic acid, tazobactam, or imipenem. the gene for ges-1 (guiana extended-spectrum beta-lactamase) was cloned, and its protein was expressed in escherichia coli dh10b, where this pi-5. 8 beta-lactamase of a ca. 31-kda molecular mass conferred resistance to oxyimino cephalosporins (mostly to  ceftazidime). ges-1 is weakly related to the other plasmid-located ambler class a extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls). the highest percentage of amino acid identity was obtained with the carbenicillinase gn79 from proteus mirabilis; with yent, a chromosome-borne penicillinase from yersinia enterocolitica; and with l-2, a chromosome-borne class a cephalosporinase from stenotrophomonas maltophilia (36% amino acid identity each). however, a dendrogram analysis showed that ges-1 clustered within a class a esbl subgroup together with esbls veb-1 and per-1. sequencing of a 7,098-bp dna fragment from plasmid ptk1 revealed that the  ges-1 gene was located on a novel class 1 integron named in52 that was characterized by (i) a 5' conserved segment containing an inti1 gene possessing two putative promoters, p(1) and p(2), for coordinated expression of the downstream antibiotic resistance genes and an atti1 recombination site; (ii) five antibiotic gene cassettes, bla(ges-1), aac(6')ib' (gentamicin resistance and amikacin susceptibility), dfrxvb (trimethoprim resistance), a novel chloramphenicol resistance gene (cmla4), and aada2 (streptomycin-spectinomycin resistance); and (iii) a 3' conserved segment consisting of qacedelta1 and suli.  the bla(ges-1) and aada2 gene cassettes were peculiar, since they lacked a typical 59-base element. this work identified the second class a esbl gene of a non-tem, non-shv series which was located in the plasmid and integron, thus providing it additional means for its spread and its expression.

TI  == norepinephrine stimulates in vitro growth but does not increase pathogenicity of  salmonella choleraesuis in an in vivo model.
AB  == norepinephrine stimulates growth of escherichia coli, yersinia enterocolitica, and pseudomonas aeruginosa in serum-supplemented media, and in vivo increases in  norepinephrine may be important in the pathogenesis of sepsis by gram-negative bacteria. because salmonellosis often is associated with stress, the effects of norepinephrine on in vitro growth, and in vivo pathogenicity of the swine pathogen salmonella choleraesuis were investigated. when rpmi 1640 with and without pig serum was inoculated with fewer than 100 s. choleraesuis/ml and incubated overnight, bacterial numbers were 10(4) to 10(6) lower in rpmi containing serum. norepinephrine restored bacterial growth in rpmi with serum to  normal levels, but it did not increase growth in serum-free rpmi. similar results were obtained with sapi, a nutrient-poor medium previously used to study the effect of norepinephrine on growth of gram-negative bacteria. conditioned media were produced by growing s. choleraesuis in rpmi containing serum with and without norepinephrine and filter sterilizing. conditioned medium produced with norepinephrine stimulated growth of s. choleraesuis but not e. coli, whereas conditioned medium produced without norepinephrine stimulated growth of both bacteria. to determine the in vivo effects of norepinephrine, rats were implanted with tablets that secrete norepinephrine for 20 to 24 hours or with identical tablets without norepinephrine and infected intraperitoneally with graded doses of s. choleraesuis. the ld-50 of s. choleraesuis was the same in both groups, and norepinephrine did not affect the carrier rate at 30 days after infection. we concluded that although norepinephrine stimulates in vitro growth of s. choleraesuis in serum-based media, the increase in norepinephrine levels in the present in vivo system was probably not sufficient to influence the pathogenesis  of s. choleraesuis infection.

TI  == effect of l-glucose and d-tagatose on bacterial growth in media and a cooked cured ham product.
AB  == cured meats such as ham can undergo premature spoilage on account of the proliferation of lactic acid bacteria. this spoilage is generally evident from a  milkiness in the purge of vacuum-packaged sliced ham. although cured, most hams are at more risk of spoilage than other types of processed meat products because  they contain considerably higher concentrations of carbohydrates, approximately 2 to 7%, usually in the form of dextrose and corn syrup solids. unfortunately, the  meat industry is restricted with respect to the choice of preservatives and bactericidal agents. an alternative approach from these chemical compounds would  be to use novel carbohydrate sources that are unrecognizable to spoilage bacteria. l-glucose and d-tagatose are two such potential sugars, and in a series of tests in vitro, the ability of bacteria to utilize each as an energy source was compared to that of d-glucose. results showed that both l-glucose and d-tagatose are not easily catabolized by a variety of lactic bacteria and not at  all by pathogenic bacteria such as escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella typhimurium, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, and yersinia enterocolitica. in a separate study, d-glucose, l-glucose, and d-tagatose were added to a chopped and formed ham formulation and the rate of bacterial growth was monitored. analysis of data by a general linear model revealed that the growth rates of total aerobic and lactic acid bacteria were significantly (p < 0.05) slower for the formulation containing d-tagatose than those containing l- or d-glucose. levels of enterobacteriaceae were initially low and these bacteria did not significantly (p < 0.20) change in the presence of any of the sugars used in the  meat formulations. compared to the control sample containing d-glucose, the shelf life of the chopped and formed ham containing d-tagatose at 10 degrees c was extended by 7 to 10 days. these results indicate that d-tagatose could deter the  growth of microorganisms and inhibit the rate of spoilage in a meat product containing carbohydrates.

AB  == fifty-one ready-to-eat street foods, 18 dishwater, and 18 surface swab samples were collected from six vendors in johannesburg, south africa. food temperatures  were recorded at the time of sampling. standard methods were used to determine aerobic plate counts (apcs), spore counts (scs), and enterobacteriaceae counts (ecs) for food samples as well as coliform counts (ccs) for water and swab samples. in addition, petrifilm escherichia coli count (pc) plates were used for  the enumeration of coliforms in food, water, and swab samples. the presence of selected foodborne pathogens in the food samples as well as the presence of nonpathogenic e. coli 1 (in food and water samples) was also tested for. predominant colonies isolated from apc plates were characterized to the genus level. holding temperatures for cooked meats and gravies ranged from 42.0 to 94.0 degrees c, and those for uncooked salads ranged from 29.0 to 39.0 degrees c. mean apc values of 3.4 (+/-0.4) log cfu/g, 4.0 (+/-1.2) log cfu/ml, and 2.1 (+/-0.4) log cfu/25 cm2 were obtained for food, water, and swab samples, respectively. mean sc values of 1.6 (+/-0.2) log cfu/g and 1.5 (+/-0.3) log cfu/25 cm2 were obtained for food and swab samples, respectively. a mean ec value of 2.0 (+/-0.4) log cfu/g for food samples and mean cc values of 2.5 (+/-0.3) log cfu/ml and 1.3  (+/-0.3) log cfu/25 cm2 for water and swab samples, respectively, were determined. mean pc values of 1.6 (+/-0.1) log cfu/g, 1.9 (+/-0.6) log cfu/ml, and 1.4 (+/-0.4) log cfu/25 cm2 were determined for food, water, and swab samples, respectively. bacillus cereus was detected in 22%, clostridium perfringens in 16%, salmonella spp. in 2%, and e. coli (non-o157:h+) in 2% of the 51 food samples. e. coli was found in 14 water samples (78%) and in 3 food samples (6%). campylobacter spp., listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus,  vibrio cholerae, and yersinia enterocolitica were also tested for in the food samples, but they were not detected. the 340 isolates obtained from apc plates for food, water, and swab samples were predominantly bacillus spp., micrococcus spp., and staphylococcus spp. for all three sample types. it was concluded that the foods analyzed in this study were of acceptable quality and safety.

AB  == the fragmentation patterns of synthetic escherichia coli-type lipid a in plasma desorption mass spectrometry (pdms) in both negative- and positive-ion modes were determined. negative-ion spectra gave signals for the main diphosphorylated (intact) molecular species in their native proportions. intact and alkaline-treated lipid a in this mode gave, for the glucosamine i moiety, easily  identified signals that have not been previously reported in pdms. these spectra  gave enough information to localize the fatty acids. the procedure was verified with relatively homogeneous lipids a prepared from salmonella minnesota r595 and  neisseria meningitidis lipopolysaccharides, and then applied to the previously unstudied yersinia entercolitica o:11,24 lipid a to obtain the localization of its fatty acids. the possibility of obtaining this much information from two negative-ion spectra was attributed to the method, described earlier, of preparing the samples. in the positive-ion mode, about half of the e. coli ions containing diglucosamine appeared as monodephosphorylated species and/or as na adducts. the intact glucosamine ii moiety and its fragment ions gave signals none of which were na adducts. with lipids a prepared from s. minnesota, n. meningitidis, and y. enterocolitica, similar fragmentation patterns were observed. for lipid a structure determination, the positive-ion mode could play a confirmatory role. the above results and some of those reported by others were compared.

TI  == pathogenic yersinia species carry a novel, cold-inducible major cold shock protein tandem gene duplication producing both bicistronic and monocistronic mrna.
AB  == inverse pcr was used to amplify major cold shock protein (mcsp) gene families from a diverse range of bacteria, including the psychrotolerant yersinia enterocolitica, which was found to have two almost identical mcsp coding regions  (cspa1 and cspa2) located approximately 300 bp apart. this tandem gene duplication was also found in y. pestis, y. pseudotuberculosis, and y. ruckeri but not in other bacteria. analysis of the transcriptional regulation of this mcsp gene in y. enterocolitica, performed by using both reverse transcriptase-pcr and northern blot assays, showed there to be two cold-inducible mrna templates arising from this locus: a monocistronic template of approximately 450 bp (cspa1) and a bicistronic template of approximately 900 bp (cspa1/a2). the former may be  due to a secondary structure between cspa1 and cspa2 causing either 3' degradation protection of cspa1 or, more probably, partial termination after cspa1. primer extension experiments identified a putative transcriptional start site (+1) which is flanked by a cold-box motif and promoter elements (-10 and -35) similar to those found in escherichia coli cold-inducible mcsp genes. at 30  degrees c, the level of both mrna molecules was negligible; however, upon a temperature downshift to 10 degrees c, transcription of the bicistronic mrna was  both substantial (300-fold increase) and immediate, with transcription of the monocistronic mrna being approximately 10-fold less (30-fold increase) and significantly slower. the ratio of bicistronic to monocistronic mrna changed with time after cold shock and was higher when cells were shocked to a lower temperature. high-resolution, two-dimensional protein gel electrophoresis showed  that synthesis of the corresponding proteins, both cspa1 and cspa2, was apparent  after only 10 min of cold shock from 30 degrees c to 10 degrees c. the data demonstrate an extraordinary capacity of the psychrotolerant y. enterocolitica to produce major cold shock proteins upon cold shock.

TI  == ferric enterochelin transport in yersinia enterocolitica: molecular and evolutionary aspects.
AB  == yersinia enterocolitica is well equipped for siderophore piracy, encompassing the utilization of siderophores such as ferrioxamine, ferrichrome, and ferrienterochelin. in this study, we report on the molecular and functional characterization of the yersinia fep-fes gene cluster orthologous to the escherichia coli ferrienterochelin transport genes (fepa, fepdgc, and fepb) and the esterase gene fes. in vitro transcription-translation analysis identified polypeptides of 30 and 35 kda encoded by fepc and fes, respectively. a frameshift mutation within the fepa gene led to expression of a truncated polypeptide of 40  kda. the fepd, fepg, and fes genes of y. enterocolitica were shown to complement  corresponding e. coli mutants. insertional mutagenesis of fepd or fes genes abrogates enterochelin-supported growth of y. enterocolitica on iron-chelated media. in contrast to e. coli, the fep-fes gene cluster in y. enterocolitica consists solely of genes required for uptake and utilization of enterochelin (fep) and not of enterochelin synthesis genes such as entf. by southern hybridization, fepdgc and fes sequences could be detected in y. enterocolitica biotypes ib, ia, and ii but not in biotype iv strains, yersinia pestis, and yersinia pseudotuberculosis strains. according to sequence alignment data and the coherent structure of the yersinia fep-fes gene cluster, we suggest early genetic divergence of ferrienterochelin uptake determinants among species of the family enterobacteriaceae.

TI  == phylogenetic analysis of l4-mediated autogenous control of the s10 ribosomal protein operon.
AB  == we investigated the regulation of the s10 ribosomal protein (r-protein) operon among members of the gamma subdivision of the proteobacteria, which includes escherichia coli. in e. coli, this 11-gene operon is autogenously controlled by r-protein l4. this regulation requires specific determinants within the untranslated leader of the mrna. secondary structure analysis of the s10 leaders  of five enterobacteria (salmonella typhimurium, citrobacter freundii, yersinia enterocolitica, serratia marcescens, and morganella morganii) and two nonenteric  members of the gamma subdivision (haemophilus influenzae and vibrio cholerae) shows that these foreign leaders share significant structural homology with the e. coli leader, particularly in the region which is critical for l4-mediated autogenous control in e. coli. moreover, these heterologous leaders produce a regulatory response to l4 oversynthesis in e. coli. our results suggest that an e. coli-like l4-mediated regulatory mechanism may operate in all of these species. however, the mechanism is not universally conserved among the gamma subdivision members, since at least one, pseudomonas aeruginosa, does not contain the required s10 leader features, and its leader cannot provide the signals for regulation by l4 in e. coli. we speculate that l4-mediated autogenous control developed during the evolution of the gamma branch of proteobacteria.

AB  == the abilities of two bacterial active heme transporters, hmbr of neisseria meningitidis and hemr of yersinia enterocolitica, to use different heme sources were compared. while hmbr-expressing cells used only hemoglobin (hb) and heme, hemr-expressing bacteria were able to grow on hb, heme, myoglobin, hemopexin, catalase, human and bovine serum albumin-heme, and haptoglobin-hemoglobin complexes as sources of iron. expression of functional hemr allowed escherichia coli cells to respond to heme-containing peptides, microperoxidases mp-8, mp-9, and mp-11, suggesting the ability of hemr to transport heme covalently linked to  other molecules. comparison of hemr with other heme receptors identified several  highly conserved histidine residues as well as two conserved amino acid motifs, the frap and npnl boxes. a site-directed mutagenesis approach was used to investigate the roles of his128, his192, his352, and his461 residues in hemr function. the hemr receptor with histidine changed to lysine at position 128 (hemr(h128k)), hemr(h461l), hemr(h461a), and hemr(h128a,h461a) mutant receptors were unable to use hb, human serum albumin-heme, and myoglobin as sources of porphyrin and iron. utilization of free heme was also severely affected, with some residual heme uptake in cells expressing hemr(h128k), hemr(h461a), and hemr(h461l). conversely, the hemr(h192t), hemr(h352a), hemr(h352k), and hemr(h192t,h352k) mutant receptors were fully functional. all mutant hemr proteins were expressed in the outer membrane at levels similar to that of the wild-type hemr receptor. nonfunctional hemrs were able to bind heme- and hb-agarose. a hypothetical model of the hemr function in which two conserved histidine residues, his128 and his461, participate in the transport of heme through the receptor pore is postulated.

TI  == induction of cytokine synthesis by flagella from gram-negative bacteria may be dependent on the activation or differentiation state of human monocytes.
AB  == we have previously demonstrated that salmonellae, but not escherichia coli or yersinia enterocolitica, stimulates tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnfalpha) production in the human promonocytic cell line u38. subsequent analysis revealed  that the tnfalpha-inducing activity of salmonellae was associated with flagellin, a major component of flagella from gram-negative bacteria. in the present study,  we have explored the basis for the apparent specificity of action of salmonella flagella on tnfalpha expression in u38 cells and have extended this analysis to normal human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc). flagella from the enteropathogenic e. coli strain e2348/69, y. enterocolitica jb580, and pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1, which did not induce significant levels of tnfalpha  production in u38 cells, were as potent as salmonella flagella in terms of tnfalpha and interleukin 1beta activation in pbmc. however, tnfalpha production in u38 cells was greatly enhanced when these cells were stimulated with flagella  from e. coli, y. enterocolitica, and p. aeruginosa in the presence of a costimulant, phorbol 13-myristate acetate. these findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the activation or differentiation state of a monocyte may have a  substantial effect on the cell's responsiveness to flagellum stimulation of cytokine synthesis. furthermore, these results indicate that cytokine induction in monocytes may be a general property of flagella from gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == ubiquicidin, a novel murine microbicidal protein present in the cytosolic fraction of macrophages.
AB  == previously we have identified and characterized three murine microbicidal proteins purified from the granule fraction of cells from the murine macrophage cell line raw264.7. during these studies evidence was obtained for the presence of an additional antimicrobial protein in the cytosolic fraction of raw264.7 cells that had been activated with interferon-gamma (ifn-gamma). in this study we have purified this protein, designated ubiquicidin, to apparent homogeneity and demonstrated that it is a cationic, small (mr 6654) protein. ubiquicidin displayed marked antimicrobial activity against listeria monocytogenes and salmonella typhimurium. using a gel overlay procedure evidence was obtained that  the protein also displays activity against escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, and an avirulent strain of yersinia enterocolitica. aminoterminal amino acid sequencing and mass spectrometry analysis of purified ubiquicidin indicated  that it is most likely identical to the ribosomal protein s30. this protein is produced by posttranslational processing of the fau protein, a 133-amino-acid fusion protein consisting of s30 linked to an unusual peptide with significant homology to ubiquitin. the fau gene has been reported to be expressed in a variety of tissues in humans and various animal species. the presence of ubiquicidin in the cytosol of macrophages may serve to restrict the intracellular growth of microorganisms. in addition, because macrophage disintegration will likely lead to release of ubiquicidin into the extracellular environment, it may  contribute to host defense after macrophage death.

TI  == the highly similar tmp kinases of yersinia pestis and escherichia coli differ markedly in their aztmp phosphorylating activity.
AB  == thymidine monophosphate (tmp) kinases are key enzymes in nucleotide synthesis for all living organisms. although eukaryotic and viral tmp kinases have been studied extensively, little is known about their bacterial counterparts. to characterize  the tmp kinase of yersinia pestis, a chromosomal region encompassing its gene (tmk) was cloned and sequenced; a high degree of conservation with the corresponding region of escherichia coli was found. the y. pestis tmk gene was overexpressed in e. coli, where the enzyme represented over 20% of total soluble  proteins. the cd spectrum of the purified tmp kinase from y. pestis was characteristic for proteins rich in alpha-helical structures. its thermodynamic stability was significantly lower than that of e. coli tmp kinase. however, the most striking difference between the two enzymes was related to their ability to  phosphorylate 3'-deoxy-3'-azidothymidine monophosphate (aztmp). although the enzymes of both species had comparable km values for this analogue, they differed significantly in their vmax for aztmp. whereas e. coli used aztmp as a relatively good substrate, the y. pestis enzyme had a vmax 100 times lower with aztmp than with tmp. this fact explains why azt, a potent bactericidal agent against e. coli, is only moderately active on y. enterocolitica. sequence comparisons between e. coli and y. pestis tmp kinases along with the three-dimensional structure of the e. coli enzyme suggest that segments lying outside the main regions involved in nucleotide binding and catalysis are responsible for the different rates of aztmp phosphorylation.

TI  == positive regulation of bacillus subtilis sigd by c-terminal truncated lacr at translational level.
AB  == degr is a positive regulator for degradative enzyme synthesis in bacillus subtilis. the degr gene is transcribed by rna polymerase containing delta d, and  the level of its expression is low in a meca-deficient mutant. in a search for suppressors of the meca effect through mini-tn10 transposon mutagenesis, a lacr mutation designated lacr288 was discovered. the b. subtilis lacr gene encodes the repressor for laca which specifies beta-galactosidase, and therefore, inactivation of the lacr gene results in overproduction of the enzyme. in the lacr288 mutant, however, the expression of laca was at a negligible level, indicating that the repressor activity was not destroyed by the mutation. the putative gene product of the lacr288-containing gene is a 288-amino acid protein  lacking the c-terminal 42 amino acids of intact lacr and carries no extra amino acids derived from the transposon sequence. the suppression by lacr288 of the decreased degr expression in the meca background was found to be caused by an increase in the delta d level as shown by western blot analysis. furthermore, the increase was due to post-transcriptional regulation of sigd, the gene encoding delta d, as revealed by using both transcriptional and translational sigd-lacz fusions. the lacr288 mutation had no effect on the stability of the delta d protein. based on these results we conclude that the lacr288 mutation stimulates  sigd expression at the translational level.

TI  == hmst, a protein essential for expression of the haemin storage (hms+) phenotype of yersinia pestis.
AB  == the haemin storage (hms) phenotype of yersinia pestis has been shown to be involved in the blockage of fleas that is required for the transmission of plague from fleas to mammals. previously, an operon encoding four genes, hmshfrs, that are essential for the temperature-regulated hms+ phenotype has been characterized. here the isolation and characterization of a fifth gene, hmst, that is essential for this phenotype is described. conceptual translation of hmst suggests it encodes a 44.8 kda protein with a pl of 7.75. the gene for hmst is located outside of the approximately 102 kb pgm locus of y. pestis that contains  the hmshfrs operon. hybridization studies indicate that yersinia pseudotuberculosis but not yersinia enterocolitica or escherichia coli possesses  a highly homologous gene. hmst belongs to a family of pled-related proteins with  four highly conserved regions of homology. although pled is a regulator, the functions of the other members of this family have not been experimentally determined. the iron-responsive regulator, fur, has previously been implicated in temperature regulation of the hms phenotype. a good potential fur-binding site (fbs) is located upstream of hmst. y. pestis m23 and two of five y. pseudotuberculosis strains, which all exhibit a temperature-constitutive hms phenotype, contain a 6 bp insertion in the putative fbs. e. coli mg1655 contains  homologues of hmshfrst (ycdsrqpt) but has an hms- phenotype. only ycdq and ycdp complement mutations in their respective homologues, hmsr and hmss, in y. pestis.

AB  == yersinia enterocolitica strains of biotype 1a are increasingly being recognized as etiological agents of gastroenteritis. however, the mechanisms by which these  bacteria cause disease differ from those of highly invasive, virulence plasmid-bearing y. enterocolitica strains and are poorly understood. we have investigated several biotype 1a strains of diverse origin for their ability to resist killing by professional phagocytes. all strains were rapidly killed by polymorphonuclear leukocytes but persisted within macrophages (activated with gamma interferon) to a significantly greater extent (survival = 40.5% +/- 17.4%)  than did escherichia coli hb101 (9.3% +/- 0.7%; p = 0.0001). strains isolated from symptomatic patients were significantly more resistant to killing by macrophages (survival = 48.9% +/- 19.5%) than were strains obtained from food or  the environment (survival = 32.1% +/- 10.3%; p = 0.04). some strains which had been ingested by macrophages or hep-2 epithelial cells showed a tendency to reemerge into the tissue culture medium over a period lasting several hours. this phenomenon, which we termed "escape," was observed in 14 of 15 strains of clinical origin but in only 3 of 12 nonclinical isolates (p = 0.001). the capacity of bacteria to escape from cells was not directly related to their invasive ability. to determine if escape was due to host cell lysis, we used a variety of techniques, including lactate dehydrogenase release, trypan blue exclusion, and examination of infected cells by light and electron microscopy, to measure cell viability and lysis. these studies established that biotype 1a y. enterocolitica strains were able to escape from macrophages or epithelial cells without causing detectable cytolysis, suggesting that escape was achieved by a process resembling exocytosis. the observations that biotype 1a y. enterocolitica strains of clinical origin are significantly more resistant to killing by macrophages and significantly more likely to escape from host cells than are strains of nonclinical origin suggest that these properties may account for the virulence of these bacteria.

TI  == genetic and biochemical characterization of an exopolygalacturonase and a pectate lyase from yersinia enterocolitica.
AB  == yersinia enterocolitica, an invasive foodborne human pathogen, degrades polypectate by producing two depolymerizing enzymes, pectate lyase (pl) and polygalacturonase (pg). the gene encoding the pg activity, designated pehy, was located in a 3-kb genomic fragment of y. enterocolitica atcc 49397. the complete  nucleotide sequence of this 3-kb fragment was determined and an open reading frame consisting of 1803 bp was predicted to encode a pg protein with an estimated m(r) of 66 kda and pi of 6.3. the amino acid sequence of prepg showed 59 and 43% identity to that of the exopolygalacturonase (exopg) of erwinia chrysanthemi and ralstonia solanacearum, respectively. the y. enterocolitica pg overproduced in escherichia coli was purified to near homogeneity using perfusion cation exchange chromatography. analysis of the pg depolymerization products by high performance anion-exchange chromatography and pulsed amperometric detection  (hpaec-pad) revealed the exolytic nature of this enzyme. the y. enterocolitica pl overproduced in e. coli was also partially purified and the m(r) and pi were estimated to be 55 kda and 5.2, respectively. hpaec-pad analysis of the pl depolymerization products indicated the endolytic nature of this enzyme. southern hybridization analyses revealed that pehy and pel genes of y. enterocolitica are  possibly encoded in the chromosome rather than in the plasmid. purified exopolygalacturonase (over 10 activity units) was unable to macerate plant tissues.

TI  == nf-kappa b is a central regulator of the intestinal epithelial cell innate immune response induced by infection with enteroinvasive bacteria.
AB  == human intestinal epithelial cells up-regulate the expression of an inflammatory gene program in response to infection with a spectrum of different strains of enteroinvasive bacteria. the conserved nature of this program suggested that diverse signals, which are activated by enteroinvasive bacteria, can be integrated into a common signaling pathway that activates a set of proinflammatory genes in infected host cells. human intestinal epithelial cell lines, ht-29, caco-2, and t84, were infected with invasive bacteria that use different strategies to induce their uptake and have different intracellular localizations (i.e., salmonella dublin, enteroinvasive escherichia coli, or yersinia enterocolitica). infection with each of these bacteria resulted in the activation of tnf receptor associated factors, two recently described serine kinases, i kappa b kinase (ikk) alpha and ikk beta, and increased nf-kappa b dna  binding activity. this was paralleled by partial degradation of i kappa b alpha and i kappa b epsilon in bacteria-infected caco-2 cells. mutant proteins that act as superrepressors of ikk beta and i kappa b alpha inhibited the up-regulated transcription and expression of downstream targets genes of nf-kappa b that are key components of the epithelial inflammatory gene program (i.e., il-8, growth-related oncogene-alpha, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, tnf-alpha, cyclooxygenase-2, nitric oxide synthase-2, icam-1) activated by those enteroinvasive bacteria. these studies position nf-kappa b as a central regulator of the epithelial cell innate immune response to infection with enteroinvasive bacteria.

AB  == the gene encoding extracellular phospholipase a1 of serratia sp. mk1 was cloned from a genomic dna library. formation of transparent halos on the pcy agar plates was used to identify e. coli carrying the phospholipase a1 gene. a 4.2 kb ecori fragment was isolated and sequenced. from nucleotide sequences and expression of  various plasmids, two open reading frames (plaa and plas) involved in efficient expression of phospholipase a1 in natural and recombinant host were identified. extracellular phospholipase a1 activity was identified as the gene product of plaa encoding 321 amino acids with a predicted mw of 33,400. analysis of the amino acid sequence revealed significant homology (around 70%) to phospholipase a1 of serratia liquefaciens and yersinia enterocolitica. the sequence, -gly-x1-ser-x2-gly-, known as a lipase-specific consensus sequence was also found in the bacterial phospholipase a1. plas encoding a protein of 224 amino acids showed no enzymatic activity, but might be necessary for the efficient expression of phospholipase a1 in e. coli. to further improve the production of phospholipase a1 as a soluble and active form in e. coli, the effect of some parameters was examined. surprisingly, a higher yield of soluble and active phospholipase a1 could be obtained under the combined conditions of a lower temperature, an enriched medium, and a lower-strength promoter.

TI  == the yersinia enterocolitica pyv virulence plasmid contains multiple intrinsic dna bends which melt at 37 degrees c.
AB  == temperature has a pleiotropic effect on yersinia enterocolitica gene expression.  temperature-dependent phenotypes include the switching between two type iii protein secretion systems, flagellum biosynthesis (</=30 degrees c) and virulence plasmid-encoded yop secretion (37 degrees c). the mechanism by which temperature  exerts this change in genetic programming is unclear; however, altered gene expression by temperature-dependent changes in dna topology has been implicated.  here, we present evidence that the y. enterocolitica virulence plasmid, pyv, undergoes a conformational transition between 30 and 37 degrees c. using a simplified two-dimensional, single-gel assay, we show that pyv contains multiple  regions of intrinsic curvature, including virf, the positive activator of virulence genes. these bends are detectable at 30 degrees c but melt at 37 degrees c, the temperature at which the cells undergo phenotypic switching. we also show that pacyc184, a plasmid used as a reporter of temperature-induced changes in dna supercoiling, has a single region of intrinsic bending detected by our assay. topoisomers of pacyc184, with and without this bend, isolated from y.  enterocolitica were resolved by using chloroquine gels. the single bend has a dramatic influence on temperature-dependent dna supercoiling. these data suggest  that the y. enterocolitica pyv plasmid may undergo a conformational change at the host temperature due to melting of dna bends followed by compensatory adjustments in superhelical density. hence, changes in dna topology may be the temperature-sensing mechanism for virulence gene expression in y. enterocolitica  and other enteric pathogens.

AB  == the chemical composition of each o-antigen subunit in gram-negative bacteria is a reflection of the unique dna sequences within each rfb operon. by characterizing  dna sequences contained with each rfb operon, a diagnostic serotype-specific probe to escherichia coli o serotypes that are commonly associated with bacterial infections can be generated. recently, from an e. coli o157:h7 cosmid library, o-antigen-positive cosmids were identified with o157-specific antisera. by using  the cosmid dnas as probes, several dna fragments which were unique to e. coli o157 serotypes were identified by southern analysis. several of these dna fragments were subcloned from o157-antigen-positive cosmids and served as dna probes in southern analysis. one dna fragment within plasmid pds306 which was specific for e. coli o157 serotypes was identified by southern analysis. the dna  sequence for this plasmid revealed homology to two rfb genes, the first of which  encodes a gdp-mannose dehydratase. these rfb genes were similar to o-antigen biosynthesis genes in vibrio cholerae and yersinia enterocolitica serotype o:8. an oligonucleotide primer pair was designed to amplify a 420-bp dna fragment from e. coli o157 serotypes. the pcr test was specific for e. coli o157 serotypes. pcr detected as few as 10 cells with the o157-specific rfb oligonucleotide primers. coupled with current enrichment protocols, o157 serotyping by pcr will provide a  rapid, specific, and sensitive method for identifying e. coli o157.

AB  == by including digoxigenin-11-dutp in a polymerase chain reaction (pcr), amplification products were produced that contained nonisotopic markers for use as dna hybridization probes. because these labeled amplicons encode pathogenic traits for specific foodborne bacteria, they can be used to detect the presence of potentially virulent organisms that may be present in foods. this technology allows the synthesis of a variety of shelf-stable probe reagents for detecting a  number of foodborne microbes of public health concern. we used this technology to detect four genes in two potential pathogens: virf and yada in enteropathogenic yersinia and stx1 and stx2 in shiga-like toxin-producing escherichia coli. results of dna hybridizations of dot blots of 68 yersinia strains and 24 of 25 e. coli strains were consistent with results of equivalent pcr analyses. dna colony  hybridization with nonisotopic virf probes of colonies arising on spread plates from artificially contaminated food homogenates was able to detect potentially pathogenic y. enterocolitica. when compared with oligonucleotide probes, amplicon probes are much less sensitive to changes in hybridization and wash temperatures, allowing greater reproducibility. labeled probe preparations were reused more than five times and have been stored at -20 degrees c for more than 8 months. this method conveniently generates probes that are safe, stable, inexpensive, reusable, and reliable.

TI  == the yersinia enterocolitica motility master regulatory operon, flhdc, is required for flagellin production, swimming motility, and swarming motility.
AB  == the ability to move over and colonize surface substrata has been linked to the formation of biofilms and to the virulence of some bacterial pathogens. results from this study show that the gastrointestinal pathogen yersinia enterocolitica can migrate over and colonize surfaces by swarming motility, a form of cooperative multicellular behavior. immunoblot analysis and electron microscopy indicated that swarming motility is dependent on the same flagellum organelle that is required for swimming motility, which occurs in fluid environments. furthermore, motility genes such as flgef, flgmn, flhba, and flia, known to be required for the production of flagella, are essential for swarming motility. to  begin to investigate how environmental signals are processed and integrated by y. enterocolitica to stimulate the production of flagella and regulate these two forms of cell migration, the motility master regulatory operon, flhdc, was cloned. mutations within flhdc completely abolished swimming motility, swarming motility, and flagellin production. dna sequence analysis revealed that this locus is similar to motility master regulatory operons of other gram-negative bacteria. genetic complementation and functional analysis of flhdc indicated that it is required for the production of flagella. when flhdc was expressed from an inducible ptac promoter, flagellin production was shown to be dependent on levels of flhdc expression. phenotypically, induction of the ptac-flhdc fusion also corresponded to increased levels of both swimming and swarming motility.

AB  == pathogenic yersinia species are associated with both localized and systemic infections in mammalian hosts. in this study, signature-tagged transposon mutagenesis was used to identify yersinia enterocolitica genes required for survival in a mouse model of infection. approximately 2000 transposon insertion mutants were screened for attenuation. this led to the identification of 55 mutants defective for survival in the animal host, as judged by their ability to  compete with the wild-type strain in mixed infections. a total of 28 mutants had  transposon insertions in the virulence plasmid, validating the screen. two of the plasmid mutants with severe virulence defects had insertions in an uncharacterized region. several of the chromosomal insertions were in a gene cluster involved in o-antigen biosynthesis. other chromosomal insertions identified genes not previously demonstrated as being required for in vivo survival of y. enterocolitica. these include genes involved in the synthesis of outer membrane components, stress response and nutrient acquisition. one severely attenuated mutant had an insertion in a homologue of the pspc gene (phage shock protein c) of escherichia coli. the phage shock protein operon has no known biochemical or physiological function in e. coli, but is apparently essential for the survival of y. enterocolitica during infection.

AB  == shotgun cloning experiments with restriction enzyme-digested genomic dna from morganella morganii 1, which expresses high levels of cephalosporinase, into the  pbkcmv cloning vector gave a recombinant plasmid, ppon-1, which encoded four entire genes: ampc, ampr, an hybf family gene, and orf-1 of unknown function. the deduced ampc beta-lactamase of pi 7.6 shared structural and functional homologies with ampc from citrobacter freundii, escherichia coli, yersinia enterocolitica, enterobacter cloacae, and serratia marcescens. the overlapping promoter organization of ampc and ampr, although much shorter in m. morganii than in the other enterobacterial species, suggested similar ampr regulatory properties. the  mics of beta-lactams for e. coli mc4100 (ampc mutant) harboring recombinant plasmid pacyc184 containing either ampc and ampr (pac-1) or ampc (pac-2) and induction experiments showed that the ampc gene of m. morganii 1 was repressed in the presence of ampr and was activated when a beta-lactam inducer was added. moreover, transformation of m. morganii 1 or of e. coli jrg582 (delta ampde) harboring ampc and ampr with a recombinant plasmid containing ampd from e. cloacae resulted in a decrease in the beta-lactam mics and an inducible phenotype for m. morganii 1, thus underlining the role of an ampd-like protein in the regulation of the m. morganii cephalosporinase. fifteen other m. morganii clinical isolates with phenotypes of either low-level inducible cephalosporinase  expression or high-level constitutive cephalosporinase expression harbored the same ampc-ampr organization, with the hybf and orf-1 genes surrounding them; the  organization of these genes thus differed from those of ampc-ampr genes in c. freundii and e. cloacae, which are located downstream from the fumarate operon. finally, an identical ampc beta-lactamase (dha-1) was recently identified as being plasmid encoded in salmonella enteritidis, and this is confirmatory evidence of a chromosomal origin of the plasmid-mediated cephalosporinases.

TI  == identification and cloning of an erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora bacteriocin regulator gene by insertional mutagenesis.
AB  == avirulent erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora cge234-m403 produces two types of  bacteriocin. for the purpose of cloning the bacteriocin genes of strain cge234m403, a spontaneous rifampin-resistant mutant of this strain, m-rif-11-2, was isolated. by tn5 insertional mutagenesis using m-rif-11-2, a mutant, tm01a01, which produces the high-molecular-weight bacteriocin but not the low-molecular-weight bacteriocin was obtained. by thermal asymmetric interlaced pcr, the dna sequence from the tn5 insertion site and the dna sequence of a contiguous 1,280-bp region were determined. one complete open reading frame (orf), designated orf2, was identified within the sequenced fragment. the 3' end  of another orf, orf1, was located upstream of orf2. a noncoding region and a putative promoter were located between orf1 and orf2. downstream from orf2, the 5' end of another orf (orf3) was found. deduction from the nucleotide sequence indicated that orf2 encodes a protein of 99 amino acids, which showed high homology with yersinia enterocolitica yrp, a regulator of enterotoxin (y-st) production; escherichia coli host factor 1, required for qbeta-replicase; and azorhizobium caulinodans nrfa, required for the expression of nifa. orf2 was designated brg, bacteriocin regulator gene. a fragment containing orf2 and its promoter was amplified and cloned into pbr322 and phsg415r, and the recombinant plasmids, pbyl1 and phyl1, were transferred into e. coli dh5. plasmid pbyl1 was reisolated and transferred into the insertion mutant tm01a01. transformants carrying the plasmid, which was reisolated and designated pbyl1, re-produced the  low-molecular-weight bacteriocin.

AB  == in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (ibd), including ulcerative colitis (uc), heat-shock protein (hsp) 60 has been detected in serum and the intestinal tract. our mouse colitis model was established using escherichia coli transformed with yersinia enterocolitica hsp60 gene as an immunizing antigen, and examined light and electron microscopically as compared with lesions of uc. the large intestine of mice injected with hsp60 antigen showed swollen goblet cells, glandular dilation, erosion, ulceration, and infiltration of inflammatory cells.  the change like crypt abscesses was also found, and various phases of inflammation were observed simultaneously in individual mice. in addition, the reticulum fibers were absent ultrastructurally in the subepithelial reticular layer. hyperplasia of the thymus was found in antigen-treated mice. these lesions were similar to those of uc. these results suggest that uc-like enteritis in mice was induced by using hsp60, considered as one of the pathogens for uc.

TI  == non-iron metalloporphyrins: potent antibacterial compounds that exploit haem/hb uptake systems of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == a new group of potent antibacterial compounds, non-iron metalloporphyrins (mps),  is described. mps possess a strong antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria, gram-negative bacteria and mycobacteria. anaerobically grown bacteria and microorganisms that do not respire and/or express haem uptake systems were resistant to mps. antibacterial activity of mps was not affected by known antibiotic resistance mechanisms operating in bacteria. the most potent mp against y. enterocolitica, methicillin-resistant s. aureus and m. smegmatis was gallium protoporphyrin ix (ga-ppix). when tested alone, ga ions and metal-free porphyrins had approximately 100-fold higher minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) values for these organisms. ga-ppix was not degraded by mp-sensitive bacteria, indicating that the whole molecule is responsible for antibacterial activity. mps are antibacterial 'trojan horses', as they exploit haem transport systems of gram-negative bacteria as portals of entry into the cell. bacterial mutants in superoxide dismutases, catalases and stationary-phase sigma factors were hypersensitive to ga-ppix. the extreme sensitivity of sod mutants to mps and the requirement for active respiration for mp activity suggests that these compounds stimulate the production of reactive oxygen radicals in bacteria. ga-ppix was not toxic to primary human fibroblasts, several established cell lines and experimental animals at concentrations > 100-fold higher than the mic for sensitive bacteria.

TI  == expression of the plague plasminogen activator in yersinia pseudotuberculosis and escherichia coli.
AB  == enteropathogenic yersiniae (yersinia pseudotuberculosis and yersinia enterocolitica) typically cause chronic disease as opposed to the closely related yersinia pestis, the causative agent of bubonic plague. it is established that this difference reflects, in part, carriage by y. pestis of a unique 9.6-kb pesticin or pst plasmid (ppcp) encoding plasminogen activator (pla) rather than distinctions between shared approximately 70-kb low-calcium-response, or lcr, plasmids (pcd in y. pestis and pyv in enteropathogenic yersiniae) encoding cytotoxic yops and anti-inflammatory v antigen. pla is known to exist as a combination of 32.6-kda (alpha-pla) and slightly smaller (beta-pla) outer membrane proteins, of which at least one promotes bacterial dissemination in vivo and degradation of yops in vitro. we show here that only alpha-pla accumulates in escherichia coli le392/ppcp1 cultivated in enriched medium and that either autolysis or extraction of this isolate with 1.0 m nacl results in release of soluble alpha and beta forms possessing biological activity. this process also converted cell-bound alpha-pla to beta-pla and smaller forms in y. pestis kim/ppcp1 and y. pseudotuberculosis pb1/+/ppcp1 but did not promote solubilization. pla-mediated posttranslational hydrolysis of pulse-labeled yops in y. pseudotuberculosis pb1/+/ppcp1 occurred more slowly than that in y. pestis  but was otherwise similar except for accumulation of stable degradation products  of yada, a pyv-mediated fibrillar adhesin not encoded in frame by pcd. carriage of ppcp by y. pseudotuberculosis did not significantly influence virulence in mice.

TI  == role of sycd, the chaperone of the yersinia yop translocators yopb and yopd.
AB  == extracellular yersinia adhering at the surface of a eukaryotic cell translocate effector yops across the plasma membrane of the cell by a mechanism requiring yopd and yopb, the latter probably mediating pore formation. we studied the role  of sycd, the intrabacterial chaperone of yopd. by producing gst-yopb hybrid proteins and sycd in escherichia coli, we observed that sycd also binds specifically to yopb and that this binding reduces the toxicity of gst-yopb in e. coli. by analysis of a series of truncated gst-yopb proteins, we observed that sycd does not bind to a discrete segment of yopb. using the same approach, we observed that yopd can also bind to yopb. binding between yopb and yopd occurred  even in the presence of sycd, and a complex composed of these three proteins could be immunoprecipitated from the cytoplasm of yersinia. in a sycd mutant, the intracellular pool of yopb and yopd was greatly reduced unless the lcrv gene was  also deleted. as lcrv is known to interact with yopb and yopd and to promote their secretion, we speculate that sycd prevents a premature association between  yopb-yopd and lcrv.

TI  == update on media for isolation of enterobacteriaceae from foods.
AB  == testing for 'total' enterobacteriaceae, coliforms and escherichia coli as marker  organisms in foods and detection of specific pathogens of the family enterobacteriaceae, including pathogenic e. coli, salmonella, shigella and yersinia spp. is widely applied in many food control laboratories. this review describes some recent developments in culture media for these organisms. methods  for enumeration of e. coli include the standard mpn technique, a membrane-filter  method and the use of media containing chromogenic and fluorogenic indicators for beta-d-glucuronidase (gud) activity. shiga toxin-producing e. coli o157 strains usually do not ferment sorbitol and are gud-negative. these characteristics are used in selective media for these organisms, such as cefixime tellurite sorbitol  macconkey agar. for the detection of salmonellae, motility enrichment in modified semisolid rappaport-vassiliadis (msrv) medium shows equal or better results than  the use of standard rappaport-vassiliadis broth. addition of nitrofurantoin to diagnostic semisolid salmonella agar and to xylose lysine desoxycholate agar favours the isolation of s. enteritidis. recently developed salmonella media use  different selective and diagnostic properties, such as acid formation from propylene glycol, glucuronate fermentation, fermentation of glycerol and addition of tergitol 4 as selective agent. the isolation of shigella spp. from foods is rather difficult and further evaluation of suggested isolation systems and the development of more effective methods for the isolation of this pathogen are needed. yersinia enterocolitica includes both pathogenic and nonpathogenic biotypes and serogroups. as no single procedure will recover all pathogenic strains of y. enterocolitica, the use of two isolation procedures in parallel is  recommended.

TI  == sequence, identification and effect on conjugation of the rmoa gene of plasmid r100-1.
AB  == the rmoa gene was recently identified from two partially overlapping sequences corresponding to a region close to the end of the tra operon of plasmid r100. its putative amino acid sequence showed strong homology to the hha protein of escherichia coli and ymoa protein of yersinia enterocolitica, which are modulators of gene expression in response to environmental stimuli. we have cloned the rmoa gene from plasmid r100-1 in puc19 and obtained the complete nucleotide sequence, which was previously published only partially and may have contained some mistakes. the rmoa gene product has been identified in radiolabelled minicells as a protein of the predicted molecular mass. the wild-type rmoa gene of plasmid r100-1 has been mutated by gene replacement and its effect on the efficiency of conjugation has been analysed. when grown in lb medium, cells harbouring r100-1 plasmid with a disrupted copy of rmoa showed a five-fold increase in conjugation frequency compared to cells harbouring r100-1 plasmid with the wild-type rmoa gene, grown in the same conditions. when cells were grown in nacl-free lb medium they showed a 50-fold increase in conjugation frequency.

TI  == measurement of antibacterial activities of t-2 toxin, deoxynivalenol, ochratoxin  a, aflatoxin b1 and fumonisin b1 using microtitration tray-based turbidimetric techniques.
AB  == various mycotoxins were tested for their antibacterial activity by evaluating growth delays using a fully automated microturbidmetric method. ten different strains of the genera escherichia, streptococcus, staphylococcus, yersinia, salmonella, erysipelothrix and lactobacillus were used as test micro-organisms. t-2 toxin, deoxynivalenol (don), ochratoxin a (ota), aflatoxin b1 (afb1) and fumonisin b1 (fb1) were used as representative mycotoxins. the inhibitory effect  in vitro was defined as the difference between the growth rate without mycotoxins and the growth rate in the presence of a mycotoxin. among the tested strains, streptococcus agalactiae was found to be sensitive to all the toxins, with the exception of ota. t-2 toxin and fb1 were the most effective in slowing down the growth of staphylococcus aureus. afb1 affected the growth of yersinia enterocolitica. the growth rate of escherichia coli and salmonella infantis was decreased by fb1. among the bacterial strains used in this study, only the growth of erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae was inhibited by ota. thus, using appropriate tester strains it should be possible to set up a broad-range microtubidimetry assay for individual mycotoxin screening in vitro. we concluded that the microtitration technique provides a rapid, convenient and high-throughput capacity system to analyse bacteria-mycotoxin interactions.

TI  == lipoprotein release by bacteria: potential factor in bacterial pathogenesis.
AB  == lipoprotein (lp) is a major component of the outer membrane of bacteria in the family enterobacteriaceae. lp induces proinflammatory cytokine production in macrophages and lethal shock in lps-responsive and -nonresponsive mice. in this study, the release of lp from growing bacteria was investigated by immuno-dot blot analysis. an immuno-dot blot assay that could detect lp at levels as low as  100 ng/ml was developed. by using this assay, significant levels of lp were detected in culture supernatants of growing escherichia coli cells. during mid-logarithmic growth, approximately 1 to 1.5 microgram of lp per ml was detected in culture supernatants from e. coli. in contrast, these culture supernatants contained 5 to 6 microgram/ml of lipopolysaccharide (lps). lp release was not unique to e. coli. salmonella typhimurium, yersinia enterocolitica, and two pathogenic e. coli strains also released lp during in vitro growth. treatment of bacteria with the antibiotic ceftazidime significantly enhanced lp release. culture supernatants from 5-h cultures of e. coli were shown to induce in vitro production of interleukin-6 (il-6) by macrophages obtained from lps-nonresponsive c3h/hej mice. in contrast, culture supernatants from an e. coli lp-deletion mutant were significantly less efficient at inducing il-6 production in c3h/hej macrophages. these results suggest, for the first time, that lp is released from growing bacteria and that this released lp may play an important role in the induction of cytokine production and pathologic changes associated with gram-negative bacterial infections.

AB  == in vitro assays to quantify killing of bacteria by macrophages provide useful insights into host-pathogen relations. in the present study, we used strains of yersinia enterocolitica and escherichia coli which varied in their ability to invade mammalian cells to evaluate these assays. the results showed that 30 min and 24 h after incubation with murine bone marrow-derived macrophages, strains of y. enterocolitica and e. coli which expressed invasin (an outer membrane protein  which allows bacteria to penetrate mammalian cells) achieved significantly greater numbers in macrophages than otherwise isogenic bacteria which lacked this protein (p < 0.01). when the 24-h data were corrected for the number of bacteria  ingested by macrophages initially, the differences between invasin-positive and -negative bacteria were no longer evident (p> 0.2). this study has shown (1) that invasin-mediated penetration of macrophages by bacteria is not associated with enhanced intracellular survival, and (2) that invasion of macrophages by bacteria may influence the interpretation of assays for bactericidal capacity unless allowance is made for the number of bacteria ingested during the early phase of the assay.

AB  == ankylosing spondylitis (as) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the sacroiliac joints and vertebral column of unknown aetiology, but strongly related to the presence of the hla-b27 antigen. the participation of bacterial infections as triggering factors have also been suggested. we have associated the 60 kda heat shock protein of klebsiella pneumoniae (hsp60kp) with as since we have previously demonstrated that most of the patients have igg antibodies and active t cells that recognize preferentially this protein, but we have not yet identified the epitopes involved in the recognition. in order to know the amino acid sequence of hsp60kp, and to be able to analyse in the future the relevant epitopes; we amplified by pcr and cloned the gene coding for this protein into the smai site of puc19. the nucleotide sequence of the gene was obtained by the sanger method using both manual and automatic techniques. amino acid sequence of the hsp60kp was deduced by translating the nucleotide sequence of the gene. the antigenic analysis of this sequence was compared to the antigenic analysis of the reported  sequences of escherichia coli groel and yersinia enterocolitica hsp60. using a software to predict hla class i motifs, the nonapeptide (krgidkavl) residues 117-125 of hsp60kp showed a much higher affinity for hla-b27 than the similar nonapeptide of e. coli groel and y. enterocolitica hsp60. the only difference between the three peptides was in position nine. this finding could explain the association of as only with the hsp60 of klebsiella pneumoniae. on the other hand, hydrophilicity analysis, which indicates b cell epitopes, showed three similar strongly antigenic regions in the three proteins.

TI  == the regulated outer membrane protein omp21 from comamonas acidovorans is identified as a member of a new family of eight-stranded beta-sheet proteins by its sequence and properties.
AB  == omp21, a minor outer membrane protein of the soil bacterium comamonas acidovorans, was purified from a spontaneous mutant lacking a surface layer and long-chain lipopolysaccharide. omp21 synthesis is enhanced by oxygen depletion, and the protein has a variable electrophoretic mobility in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis due to its heat-modifiable behavior. the structural gene omp21 encodes a precursor of 204 amino acids with a putative  signal peptide of 21 amino acids. mature omp21 is a typical outer membrane protein with a high content of beta structure as determined by infrared spectroscopy. sequence comparisons show that it belongs to a new outer membrane protein family, characterized by eight amphipathic beta strands, which includes virulence proteins, such as the neisserial opacity proteins, salmonella typhimurium rck, and yersinia enterocolitica ail, as well as the major outer membrane proteins ompa from escherichia coli and oprf from pseudomonas aeruginosa.

TI  == enteric bacterial pathogens in stools of residents of urban and rural regions in  nigeria: a comparison of patients with and without diarrhoea and controls without diarrhoea.
AB  == a total of 2,400 stool samples comprising 1,200 from patients with diarrhoea (600 each from urban and rural area) and 1,200 similarly divided controls were obtained from school children and clinic attendants of government and private clinics around three designated study centres of edo, lagos and cross river states, nigeria. these were screened for the prevalence of bacteria that could cause diarrhoea. diarrhoea cases in urban areas had a high prevalence rate for campylobacter spp. (28%), followed by enteropathogenic escherichia coli (22%), salmonella spp. (17%), shigella spp. (14%), aeromonas spp. (5%), and yersinia enterocolitica (4%), whereas in rural areas e. coli was the most frequently encountered pathogen (18%), followed by salmonella spp. (16%), aeromonas spp. (15%), shigella spp. (9%), campylobacter spp. (8%), and plesiomonas shigelloides  (8%). a similar distribution but with lower rates was noted for controls in both  urban and rural areas, however, no p. shigelloides was isolated. results highlight a possible difference between the prevalence of enteric bacteria in rural and urban areas and reveals the strong association of aeromonas and plesiomonas species with cases of diarrhoea in nigeria.

TI  == the psychrotrophic bacterium yersinia enterocolitica requires expression of pnp,  the gene for polynucleotide phosphorylase, for growth at low temperature (5 degrees c).
AB  == the psychrotrophic bacterium yersinia enterocolitica is characterized by temperature-dependent adaptations. to investigate y. enterocolitica genes involved in cold adaptation, a mutant restricted in its ability to grow at 5 degrees c was isolated from a transposon mutant library. the transposon insertion site in this psychrotrophy-defective (pd) mutant mapped 16 bp upstream of an open reading frame whose predicted amino acid sequence showed 93% similarity with the  escherichia coli exoribonuclease polynucleotide phosphorylase (pnpase), encoded by pnp. expression of this gene was blocked in the pd mutant. however, the introduction of a second copy of pnp, including 0.33 kbp sequences upstream of its coding region, into the chromosome of the pd mutant restored pnp expression as well as the ability to grow at 5 degrees c. furthermore, the expression of pnp appeared to be temperature dependent: in the parental y. enterocolitica strain, the levels of both pnp mrna and pnpase were 1.6-fold higher at 5 degrees c compared with 30 degrees c. a similarly enhanced level of pnpase at 5 degrees c was observed in the merodiploid recombinant strain, which indicates that the 0.33 kbp region upstream of pnp harboured a cold-inducible promoter. a putative cold shock promoter motif (attgg) was observed in this region.

TI  == in vitro association between the virulence proteins, yopd and yope, of yersinia enterocolitica.
AB  == the virulence plasmid (pyv) of y. enterocolitica encodes a set of anti-host proteins, known as yops, which contribute to survival of the bacteria in the host. several yops directly influence the interaction of pathogenic bacteria with host cells which in the case of at least four yops, yope, yoph, yopm and ypka (yopo), involves translocation of the yop across the eukaryotic cell membrane into the cytoplasm of target cells. translocation requires the presence of two other pyv-encoded proteins, yopb and yopd, but it is not clear how these proteins mediate translocation of the effector yops. we have used an affinity blot technique (overlay) to examine potential binding between yopd and other yops. the results indicated that under the in vitro conditions used in this study, yopd bound preferentially to yope and yopb. to investigate the interaction of yopd and yope in more detail we produced different regions of the yopd protein in escherichia coli by creating fusions of yopd with glutathione s-transferase. these studies showed that yope bound the central hydrophobic region of yopd. this is the first demonstration of protein interactions between an effector yop and a  putative yop translocator.

TI  == studying the effect of temperature on microbial growth using multiplicative model.
AB  == the specific growth rates of brochothrix thermosphacta, listeria monocytogenes, yersinia enterocolitica, bacillus cereus, escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella spp., staphylococcus aureus and clostridium perfringens at various temperatures were taken from the food micromodel database, and the data sets of specific growth rate versus temperature were fitted using the multiplicative model (r = a  td, r = specific growth rate; t = temperature; a, d = regression parameters). the exponential d-value derived from microbial growth at suboptimum temperatures reflected the effectiveness of temperature in enhancing growth. a microorganism with a large d-value exhibited a large increment of growth rate as temperature increased. the d-value of a microorganism was related to the temperature range for growth. the temperature range for the growth of psychrotrophs was usually narrow for b. thermosphacta and y. enterocolitica; hence the d-values of these two psychrotrophs were close to 1 whereas d-values of mesophiles, such as b. cereus, e. coli o157:h7, salmonella spp., and s. aureus, were 2.31-2.90, and the  d-value of c. perfringens, a thermophile, was 3.29. the values of parameter a of  the model were affected by extra salt added into cultures. for all the strains mentioned above, the a-values decreased when the cultures contained higher levels of salt. the lowering of the a-value implied that the influence of temperature on the growth rate in the model was reduced. the change of the d-value was dependent on the capability of the microorganism to overcome the obstacle to growth and was affected by the composition of the nutrients and by inhibitory factors in the culture. the influence of environmental factors on the d-value was also found in  chinese sausages. the d-value of a dominant spoilage strain of enterococcus sp. derived from sausages was 0.833 whereas the d-value derived from mrs cultures was 2.36. in refrigerated foods which usually contained some preservatives and were stored at low temperature, the d-value of psychrotrophic spoilage bacteria was around 1. in this case, the linear model could be a reasonable choice for predicting the proliferation of spoilage bacteria.

TI  == assessment of invasion frequencies of cultured hep-2 cells by clinical isolates of helicobacter pylori using an acridine orange assay.
AB  == aims: recent studies suggest that helicobacter pylori is an invasive enteropathogen. however, the efficiency with which this pathogen invades mammalian cells remains unknown. therefore, this study was designed to investigate the invasion frequencies of hep-2 cells by clinical strains of h pylori. methods: an acridine orange assay and cultured hep-2 cell monolayers were used to determine the hep-2 cell penetration frequencies of 17 clinical isolates  and one american type culture collection (atcc) strain of h pylori, and single clinical strains of yersinia enterocolitica, shigella flexneri, and a non-invasive atcc escherichia coli strain. results: the acridine orange assay demonstrated that invasion frequencies of hep-2 cells by all h pylori isolates were significant and, in most instances, exceeded those for the s flexneri strain and equalled those for the y enterocolitica strain. the assay also showed that internalised h pylori organisms remained viable for at least six hours, the maximum time that bacteria and hep-2 cells were co-incubated. conclusions: these  results may have important implications for treatment and prevention strategies for this gastric pathogen. furthermore, the acridine orange assay may be useful for assessing, in vitro, the ability of conventional and newer antibiotics, alone or in combination, to kill intracellular h pylori organisms.

TI  == molecular recognition of siderophores: a study with cloned ferrioxamine receptors (foxa) from erwinia herbicola and yersinia enterocolitica.

TI  == expression of invasin and motility are coordinately regulated in yersinia enterocolitica.
AB  == the yersinia enterocolitica inv gene encodes the primary invasion factor invasin, which has been previously shown to be critical in the initial stages of infection. the expression of inv is influenced by growth phase and temperature and is maximal during late exponential-early stationary phase at 23 degrees c. in addition, motility of y. enterocolitica is regulated by temperature. y. enterocolitica cells are motile when grown at lower temperatures (30 degrees c or below), while bacteria grown at 37 degrees c are nonmotile. this study was initiated to determine the molecular basis for the temperature regulation of inv  expression. two mutants were isolated that both showed a significant decrease in  invasin expression but are hypermotile when grown at 23 degrees c. the first mutant (jb1a8v) was a result of a random mtn5km insertion into the uvrc gene. the uvrc mutant jb1a8v demonstrated a significant decrease in inv and an increase in  fleb (encodes flagellin) expression. these results suggest that expression of inv and flagellin genes is coordinated at the level of transcription. the second regulatory mutant, jb16v, was a result of a targeted insertion into a locus similar to sspa which in e. coli encodes a stationary-phase regulator. the e. coli sspa gene was cloned and assayed for complementation in both of the regulatory mutants. it was determined that e. coli sspa restored invasin expression in both the uvrc mutant and the sspa mutant. in addition, the complementing clone decreased flagellin levels in these mutants.

TI  == the yersiniabactin biosynthetic gene cluster of yersinia enterocolitica: organization and siderophore-dependent regulation.
AB  == the ability to synthesize and uptake the yersinia siderophore yersiniabactin is a hallmark of the highly pathogenic, mouse-lethal species yersinia pestis, y. pseudotuberculosis, and y. enterocolitica 1b. we have identified four genes, irp1, irp3, irp4, and irp5, on a 13-kb chromosomal dna fragment of y. enterocolitica 08, wa-314. these genes constitute the yersiniabactin biosynthetic gene cluster together with the previously defined irp2. the irp1 gene consists of 9,486 bp capable of encoding a 3,161-amino-acid high-molecular-weight protein 1 (hmwp1) polypeptide with a predicted mass of 384.6 kda. the first 3,000 bp of irp1 show similarity to the corresponding regions of the polyketide synthase genes of bacillus subtilis and streptomyces antibioticus. the remaining part of irp1 is most similar to irp2, encoding hmwp2, which might be the reason for immunological cross-reactivity of the two polypeptides. irp4 was found to have 41.7% similarity to thioesterase-like protein of the anguibactin biosynthetic genes of vibrio anguillarum. irp5 shows 41% similarity to ente, the 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid-activating enzyme utilized in enterobactin synthesis of escherichia coli. irp4 and irp5 are nearly identical to ybtt and ybte, recently identified in y. pestis. irp3 has no similarity to any known gene. inactivation of either irp1 or irp2 abrogates yersiniabactin synthesis. mutations in irp1 or fyua (encoding yersiniabactin/pesticin receptor) result in downregulation of irp2 that can be upregulated by the addition of yersiniabactin. a fyua-green fluorescent protein translational fusion was downregulated in an irp1 mutant. upregulation was achieved by addition of yersiniabactin but not desferal, pesticin, or pyochelin, which indicates high specificity of the fyua receptor and autoregulation of genes involved in synthesis and uptake of yersiniabactin.

TI  == prevalence of the "high-pathogenicity island" of yersinia species among escherichia coli strains that are pathogenic to humans.
AB  == the fyua-irp gene cluster contributes to the virulence of highly pathogenic yersinia (yersinia pestis, yersinia pseudotuberculosis, and yersinia enterocolitica 1b). the cluster encodes an iron uptake system mediated by the siderophore yersiniabactin and reveals features of a pathogenicity island. two evolutionary lineages of this "high pathogenicity island" (hpi) can be distinguished on the basis of dna sequence comparison: a y. pestis group and a y. enterocolitica group. in this study we demonstrate that the hpi of the y. pestis  evolutionary group is disseminated among species of the family enterobacteriaceae which are pathogenic to humans. it prevails in enteroaggregative escherichia coli and in e. coli blood culture isolates (93 and 80%, respectively), but is rarely found in enteropathogenic e. coli, enteroinvasive e. coli, and enterotoxigenic e. coli isolates. in contrast, the hpi was absent from enterohemorrhagic e. coli, shigella, and salmonella enterica strains investigated. polypeptides encoded by the fyua, irp1, and irp2 genes located on the hpi could be detected in e. coli strains pathogenic to humans. however, these e. coli strains showed a reduced sensitivity to the bacteriocin pesticin, whose uptake is mediated by the fyua receptor. escherichia strains do not possess the hms gene locus thought to be a part of the hpi of y. pestis. deletions of the jua-irp gene cluster affecting solely the fyua part of the hpi were identified in 3% of the e. coli strains tested. these results suggest horizontal transfer of the hpi between y. pestis and some pathogenic e. coli strains.

TI  == the clpp protein, a subunit of the clp protease, modulates ail gene expression in yersinia enterocolitica.
AB  == yersinia enterocolitica is a gastrointestinal pathogen of humans and animals. ail is a 17kda cell-surface protein that confers on y. enterocolitica resistance to serum killing and the ability to attach to and invade cells in vitro. the ail gene of y. enterocolitica is regulated by temperature and growth phase. in stationary phase, ail transcript is only detected when bacteria are grown at the  host temperature of 37 degrees c. our laboratory previously described a group of  mini-tn10 mutants, which expressed ail in stationary phase at 28 degrees c. in one of these mutants, dp5102::mini-tn10 3-2, the mini-tn 10 inserted into a gene  encoding a protein with 90.3% identity to the clpp protease subunit from escherichia coli. expression of ail in stationary phase at 28 degrees c was also  derepressed in a directed y. enterocolitica clpp mutant. analysis of ail transcripts in the wild-type and clpp mutant strains indicated that there is a single start site of transcription of ail and that the effect of the clpp mutation was on the initiation of transcription at this site. similar to e. coli, a clpx homologue was identified downstream of clpp. the y. enterocolitica clpp gene complemented the clpp mutant phenotype, repressing the expression of both ail transcript levels and cell surface-expressed ail protein. thus, clpp has a role in the modulation of ail transcription in y. enterocolitica.

TI  == dna shuffling of a family of genes from diverse species accelerates directed evolution.
AB  == dna shuffling is a powerful process for directed evolution, which generates diversity by recombination, combining useful mutations from individual genes. libraries of chimaeric genes can be generated by random fragmentation of a pool of related genes, followed by reassembly of the fragments in a self-priming polymerase reaction. template switching causes crossovers in areas of sequence homology. our previous studies used single genes and random point mutations as the source of diversity. an alternative source of diversity is naturally occurring homologous genes, which provide 'functional diversity'. to evaluate whether natural diversity could accelerate the evolution process, we compared the efficiency of obtaining moxalactamase activity from four cephalosporinase genes evolved separately with that from a mixed pool of the four genes. a single cycle  of shuffling yielded eightfold improvements from the four separately evolved genes, versus a 270- to 540-fold improvement from the four genes shuffled together, a 50-fold increase per cycle of shuffling. the best clone contained eight segments from three of the four genes as well as 33 amino-acid point mutations. molecular breeding by shuffling can efficiently mix sequences from different species, unlike traditional breeding techniques. the power of family shuffling may arise from sparse sampling of a larger portion of sequence space.

AB  == the rfah protein controls the transcription of a specialized group of escherichia coli and salmonella operons that direct the synthesis, assembly and export of the lipopolysaccharide core, exopolysaccharide, f conjugation pilus and haemolysin toxin. rfah is a specific regulator of transcript elongation; its loss increases  transcription polarity in these operons without affecting initiation from the operon promoters. the operons of the rfah-dependent regulon contain a short conserved 5' sequence, the ops element, deletion of which increases operon polarity to an extent similar to that caused by loss of rfah. the ops element is  also present upstream of polysaccharide gene clusters of shigella flexneri, yersinia enterocolitica, vibrio cholerae and klebsiella pneumoniae and the rp4 fertility operon of pseudomonas aeruginosa, suggesting that this is a widely spread control system. the mechanistic coupling of rfah and the ops element has been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo, and we suggest that the ops element recruits rfah and potentially other factors to the rna polymerase complex, modifying the complex to increase its processivity and allowing transcription to  proceed over long distances.

AB  == the inv gene of yersinia enterocolitica codes for invasin, a member of the invasin/intimin-like protein family, which mediates the internalization of the bacterium into cultured epithelial cells. the putative inclusion of inv into a pathogenicity island was tested by investigating its flanking sequences. indeed,  the enteropathogenic escherichia coli (epec) intimin, a member of the same family of proteins, is encoded by eaea, a gene which belongs to a pathogenicity island.  an orf located upstream from inv was of particular interest since it appeared homologous both to the flagellar flha gene and to sepa, an epec gene lying inside the same pathogenicity island as eaea. a mutant in this orf was non-motile and non-flagellated while its invasion phenotype remained unaffected. these data indicated that the orf corresponded to the flha gene of y. enterocolitica. subsequently, the flhb and flhe genes, located respectively upstream and downstream from flha, were identified. the three flh genes appear to be transcribed from a single operon called flhb, according to the nomenclature used  for salmonella typhimurium. intergenic sequence between flhe and inv includes a grey hole, with no recognizable function. downstream from inv, we have detected the flagellar flgm operon as already reported. finally, the incongruous localization of inv amidst the flagellar cluster is discussed; while transposition could explain this phenomenon, no trace of such an event was detected.

TI  == emerging foodborne diseases: an evolving public health challenge.
AB  == the epidemiology of foodborne disease is changing. new pathogens have emerged, and some have spread worldwide. many, including salmonella, escherichia coli o157:h7, campylobacter, and yersinia enterocolitica, have reservoirs in healthy food animals, from which they spread to an increasing variety of foods. these pathogens cause millions of cases of sporadic illness and chronic complications,  as well as large and challenging outbreaks over many states and nations. improved surveillance that combines rapid subtyping methods, cluster identification, and collaborative epidemiologic investigation can identify and halt large, dispersed  outbreaks. outbreak investigations and case-control studies of sporadic cases can identify sources of infection and guide the development of specific prevention strategies. better understanding of how pathogens persist in animal reservoirs is also critical to successful long-term prevention. in the past, the central challenge of foodborne disease lay in preventing the contamination of human food  with sewage or animal manure. in the future, prevention of foodborne disease will increasingly depend on controlling contamination of feed and water consumed by the animals themselves.

AB  == two monoclonal antibodies (mabs), designated as h9 (igg2a) and h20 (igm), directed against heat-shock protein 60 (hsp60) of helicobacter pylori strain tk1029 were established. affinity-purified antigens cross-reacted in immunoblots  with mab h9 and mab h20 respectively. these antigens also reacted with the 3c8 mab previously established in this laboratory, which recognised yersinia enterocolitica hsp60. by amino-acid sequence analysis, the n-terminal amino-acid  sequence of the protein recognised by both h9 and h20 mabs was confirmed as the amino-acid sequence of h. pylori hsp60 reported previously. both mabs reacted with nine strains of h. pylori in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) and immunoblot analysis. in addition, mab h9 reacted with extracts of other bacteria  including h. mustelae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, vibrio cholerae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli and shigella sonnei. in contrast, mab h20 reacted only with strains h. pylori. these results suggest that both the  species-specific epitope recognised by mab h20 and the common epitope recognised  by mab h9 exist on hsp60 of the bacterial cell. both mabs also reacted with the 60-kda protein in the lysate of human gastric carcinoma (mkn45) cells. it was shown by immunohistochemical staining that gastric epithelial cells of four out of six biopsy specimens examined stained positively with mab h20. these results suggest that there is a common epitope in h. pylori hsp60 and human gastric epithelial cells.

TI  == contribution of the mn-cofactored superoxide dismutase (soda) to the virulence of yersinia enterocolitica serotype o8.
AB  == enteric pathogens harbor a set of enzymes (e.g., superoxide dismutases [sod]) for detoxification of endogenous and exogenous reactive oxygen species which are encountered during infection. to analyze the role of the mn-cofactored sod (soda) in the pathogenicity of yersiniae, we cloned the soda gene of yersinia enterocolitica serotype o8 by complementation of an escherichia coli soda sodb mutant and subsequently constructed an isogenic mutant by allelic exchange. sequence analysis revealed an open reading frame that enabled the deduction of a  sequence of 207 amino acids with 85% identity to soda of e. coli. in a mouse infection model, the soda null mutant was strongly attenuated in comparison to its parental strain. after intravenous infection, the survival and multiplication of the mutant in the spleen and liver were markedly reduced. in contrast, inactivation of soda had only minor effects on survival and multiplication in the gut and peyer's patches, as could be demonstrated in the orogastric infection model. the reduction in virulence was accompanied by a low but significant increase of susceptibility of the soda mutant to bacterial killing by polymorphonuclear leukocytes (pmn) and an alteration of the intracellular chemiluminescence response of pmn. these results suggest that the resistance of y. enterocolitica to exogenous oxygen radicals produced by phagocytes involves the mn-cofactored sod. the important role of soda for the pathogenicity of y. enterocolitica could also be due to detoxification of endogenous, metabolically produced oxygen radicals which are encountered by extracellular enteric pathogens during the invasion of the host.

TI  == salmonellae activate tumor necrosis factor alpha production in a human promonocytic cell line via a released polypeptide.
AB  == invasive strains of salmonella spp. cause both systemic and localized infections  in humans. the ability to resist infection and some aspects of the tissue pathology associated with the presence of salmonella in the gastrointestinal tract have been shown to be mediated in part by the induction of tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha), a proinflammatory cytokine produced by activated macrophages and lymphocytes. recent reports indicate that tnf-alpha is involved in the induction of human immunodeficiency virus replication by salmonella in the latently infected human promonocytic cell line u1. in the present study, we investigated the effects of salmonella on tnf-alpha production in u1 cells and a  related cell line, u38. unlike escherichia coli or yersinia enterocolitica, salmonellae rapidly induce tnf-alpha expression in these cells through a released factor(s). time course experiments show that the kinetics of tnf-alpha production by u38 cells stimulated with salmonella conditioned medium closely resemble those observed in response to live salmonella. the observation that tnf-alpha levels are elevated by 60 min after exposure to either bacteria or their conditioned medium suggests that the soluble inducer is continuously released or shed by the  bacteria and that the signal acts rapidly to increase tnf-alpha production. furthermore, the ability to produce the tnf-alpha inducer is shared by at least four salmonella serotypes and does not correlate with the abilities to invade and to survive within phagocytes. treatment of active conditioned medium with trypsin, but not low ph, high temperature, or urea, significantly inhibits its tnf-alpha-inducing effect on u38 cells, a finding which points to a polypeptide product of salmonella as the mediator of tnf-alpha production. gel filtration chromatography of salmonella conditioned medium reveals two peaks of activity, consistent with molecular masses of approximately 150 and 110 kda.

TI  == is undifferentiated seronegative spondyloarthropathy a forme fruste of reactive arthritis?
AB  == undifferentiated spondyloarthropathy (uspa) may either represent a forme fruste of other spondyloarthropathies like reactive arthritis or be a different disease  entity. to study the link between uspa and reactive arthritis, we studied the presence of iga antibodies to yersinia enterocolitica, salmonella typhimurium, shigella flexneri, campylobacter jejuni and chlamydia trachomatis in sera from 14 patients with uspa (european spondyloarthropathy study group criteria) using elisa. escherichia coli was used as a control antigen. an od value of more than the mean +/- 2 s.d. of 51 blood donors was considered positive. five patients had elevated iga antibodies to s. flexneri, while two patients each had elevated antibody levels to s. typhimurium and chlamydia. no patient had elevated antibodies to y. enterocolitica, c. jejuni and e. coli. among 51 normals, 1, 4, 3, 2 and 3 had elevated antibodies to s. flexneri, s. typhimurium, y. enterocolitica, c. jejuni and e. coli, respectively. nine of 14 patients with uspa had antibodies to one of the bacteria implicated in reactive arthritis: of these, antibodies to shigella were the most frequent. thus, a proportion of patients with uspa may in fact have reactive arthritis.

TI  == public health and pork and pork products: regional perspectives of denmark.
AB  == an ambitious programme to eliminate pork as an important source of human salmonellosis was initiated in denmark in 1993 by the ministry of food, agriculture and fisheries. the programme comprises control of feedmills, breeding and multiplying herds, slaughter herds and slaughter plants, as well as the final product, fresh pork. as a consequence, the level of occurrence of salmonella spp. in fresh pork produced in denmark is approximately 1%. yersinia enterocolitica 0:3 infections are common in slaughter pig herds in denmark, and pork is considered to be the only source of human infection in the country. the incidence of pork-related occurrences of human salmonellosis and yersiniosis in 1996 was approximately nine cases per 100,000 inhabitants for both diseases. all swine in  denmark are screened for trichinella spp. infection, although no positive results have been obtained since 1930. swine are not considered to be a source for campylobacter jejuni or enterohaemorrhagic escherichia coli in denmark. listeria  monocytogenes can be detected in relatively high rates in pork: however, the incidence of human listeriosis is only 0.5 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. toxoplasma gondii antibodies have been demonstrated in 3% of slaughter pigs, though the importance of pork as a source of infection is probably very low. denmark is officially free from brucella abortus, b. melitensis and mycobacterium bovis.

TI  == comparative sensitivity of 13 species of pathogenic bacteria to seven chemical germicides.
AB  == background: the relative resistance of diverse human bacterial pathogens to commonly used germicidal agents has not been established. methods: we measured by titration the survival of thirteen different bacteria after exposure to glutaraldehyde, formaldehyde, hydrogen peroxide, peracetic acid, cupric ascorbate, sodium hypochlorite, or phenol. results: our comparative experiments allowed classification of the organisms' survival into four groups: (a) pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus showed the most resistance, (b)  clostridium perfringens, salmonella typhimurium, staphylococcus epidermidis, and  escherichia coli o157:h7 showed intermediate resistance, (c) listeria monocytogenes, shigella sonnei, and vibrio parahaemolyticus survived some treatments with chemical agents only in the presence of protecting protein (serum albumin), and (d) vibrio cholerae, vibrio vulnificus, bacillus cereus, and yersinia enterocolitica did not survive any of the treatments applied. conclusion: we found species that more frequently survived exposure to germicidal agents were also those most commonly reported in association with hospital infections. our findings suggest that resistance to disinfectants may be more important than pathogenicity in determining the relative prominence of an organism as an agent responsible for nosocomial infections.

TI  == microbiological composition of raw milk from selected farms in the camembert region of normandy.
AB  == raw milk from 27 farms was sampled over 6 months for listerias, salmonellas, yersinia enterocolitica and campylobacters. total bacterial counts and somatic cell counts were measured. lactococci, lactobacilli, dextran-producing leuconostocs, brevibacterium linens, yeasts and moulds, staphylococcus aureus and other micrococcaceae, pseudomonas, coliforms, escherichia coli, enterococci, clostridium perfringens and spores of anaerobic lactate-fermenting bacteria were  also counted. pseudomonas (2000 cfu ml-1), lactococci (760 cfu ml-1) and micrococcaceae (720 cfu ml-1) were the most numerous groups. lactic acid bacteria were detected in all samples. coliforms were present in most samples, but 84% of  samples had counts < 100 cfu ml-1. staphylococcus aureus was detected in 62% of milks, the average count was 410 cfu ml-1. about 80% of supplies had < or = 10 e. coli cfu ml-1 and all samples had < or = 1 cl. perfringens cfu ml-1. two of the tested milks were positive for salmonellas (2.9%), four were positive for listeria monocytogenes (5.8%), 25 for yersinia enterocolitica (36%) and one for campylobacters (1.4%).

TI  == sequence analysis and enzyme kinetics of the l2 serine beta-lactamase from stenotrophomonas maltophilia.
AB  == the l2 serine active-site beta-lactamase from stenotrophomonas maltophilia has been classified as a clavulanic acid-sensitive cephalosporinase. the gene encoding this enzyme from s. maltophilia 1275 iid has been cloned on a 3.3-kb fragment into pk18 under the control of a ptac promoter to generate recombinant plasmid pub5840; when expressed in escherichia coli, this gene confers resistance to cephalosporins and penicillins. sequence analysis has revealed an open reading frame (orf) of 909 bp with a gc content of 71.6%, comparable to that of the l1 metallo-beta-lactamase gene (68.4%) from the same bacterium. the orf encodes an unmodified protein of 303 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 31.5 kda, accommodating a putative leader peptide of 27 amino acids. comparison of the amino acid sequence with those of other beta-lactamases showed it to be most closely related (54% identity) to the bla-a beta-lactamase from yersinia enterocolitica. sequence identity is most obvious near the stxk active-site motif and the sdn loop motif common to all serine active-site penicillinases. sequences outside the conserved regions display low homology with comparable regions of other class a penicillinases. kinetics of the enzyme from the cloned gene demonstrated an increase in activity with cefotaxime but markedly less activity with imipenem than previously reported. hence, the s. maltophilia l2 beta-lactamase is an inducible ambler class a beta-lactamase which would account  for the sensitivity to clavulanic acid.

TI  == a novel model of bacterially-induced acute anterior uveitis in rats and the lack  of effect from hla-b27 expression.
AB  == background: humans with the major histocompatibility antigen b27 (hla-b27) are especially at risk for developing rheumatic disorders such as ankylosing spondylitis and reiter's syndrome. acute anterior uveitis (aau) often occurs in association with these diseases or in hla b27 positive individuals without joint  disease. methods: we induced acute anterior uveitis in lewis rats by a standard model, the intraperitoneal injection of 200 micrograms of escherichia coli endotoxin. we also developed a novel model of uveitis secondary to gram-negative  infection. results: transgenic rats that expressed a low copy number of the b27 gene did not differ statistically from litter mate controls in the intensity of anterior uveitis as judged by histology, enumeration of cells in aqueous humor, protein in aqueous humor, or slit lamp examination. the majority of rats exposed  to live salmonella enteritidis or yersinia enterocolitica 0:3 using either an oral or intravenous route of infection developed anterior uveitis. in contrast to the disease induced by endotoxin that is most intense 24 hours after the endotoxin challenge, uveitis induced by live bacteria usually began 7 to 9 days after exposure to bacterial products, was more often unilateral, persisted for as long as 3 weeks, and was sometimes recurrent. the expression of hla-b27 did not appear to influence the incidence or severity of uveitis in b27+ low copy heterozygous animals. conclusion: this rat model of aau should facilitate evaluation of bacterial antigenic component(s) involved in the pathogenesis of live gram-negative bacteria induced aau.

TI  == nested polymerase chain reaction strategy simultaneously targeting dna sequences  of multiple bacterial species in inflammatory joint diseases. i. screening of synovial fluid samples of patients with spondyloarthropathies and other arthritides.
AB  == objective: bacteria play a crucial pathogenetic role in lyme arthritis (la), reactive arthritis (rea), other forms of spondyloarthropathy (spa), and possibly  in undifferentiated oligoarthritis (uoligo). polymerase chain reaction (pcr) technology has been applied to detect bacterial dna of individual microbes in synovial fluid (sf) of patients with arthritides. we screened for dna sequences of 8 bacterial species simultaneously in sf of patients with inflammatory joint disease. methods: we examined 104 sf samples of 96 patients with rea (n = 13), undifferentiated spa (uspa, n = 10), uoligo (n = 50), juvenile chronic arthritis  (jca, n = 13), and rheumatoid arthritis (ra, n = 10). a nested pcr approach was developed to detect dna sequences of 8 bacteria: chlamydia trachomatis, c. pneumoniae, yersinia enterocolitica, salmonella enteritidis, campylobacter jejuni, shigella flexneri, klebsiella pneumoniae, and borrelia burgdorferi. the detection limit was determined at 10 bacterial/sample. serology and lymphocyte proliferation assay were done in parallel in most patients. results: in 12 cases  bacterial dna of b. burgdorferi (n = 7), c. trachomatis (n = 2), c. jejuni (n = 2), and c. pneumoniae (n = 1) was detected in patients with uoligo (n = 9) and jca (n = 3), while no evidence of bacterial dna was found in patients with rea, uspa, and ra. shigella flexneri dna was detected in 4 cases, but the significance of this finding remains uncertain due to the high sequence homology of this species with escherichia coli. dna of y. enterocolitica, s. enteritidis, or k. pneumoniae was not found. a positive serologic response was found in 7/9 pcr positive patients. in 11/96 cases antibodies to 2 or more bacteria were found in  parallel (11.5%). antigen specific lymphocyte proliferation was observed in 5/9 pcr positive patients. conclusion: bacterial dna was detected in peripheral joint of patients with uoligo and jca, but not in rea, uspa, or ra in this study. the detection of bacterial dna in synovial material by pcr technology gives useful diagnostic information, especially when antibodies against several microbes are present or antibodies are not detectable. failure to detect bacterial dna in patients with rea and uspa with longstanding disease suggests that in later stages autoimmune mechanisms may operate.

TI  == monitoring the microbiology of high quality milk by monthly sampling over 2 years.
AB  == the concentrations of seven types of microorganism in the milk produced by farms  using high quality milking procedures were monitored monthly. the most commonly encountered bacterium was pseudomonas, whose concentration varied greatly between samples, but lactococci, lactobacilli and yeasts were also present at more stable concentrations. staphylococcus aureus and beta-glucuronidase-positive escherichia coli were occasionally detected. listeria monocytogenes was found in the samples  from only one farm, while yersinia enterocolitica was never detected. there were  seasonal variations in the concentrations of lactobacilli and yeasts over the 2 years monitored. the changes in certain bacteria (lactococcus, lactobacillus) on  any given farm were very similar from one year to the next. the microbiological characteristics of the milk from the farms examined seemed to be fairly constant. the profiles of some bacteria used for cheesemaking were relatively stable over time. it thus seems that the milk provided by different producers could be typed.

AB  == partial sequencing of a genomic library of the virulence plasmid of salmonella enteritidis has been used to localize in the restriction map of this plasmid the  genetic loci already described in other salmonella plasmids. the comparison of the vestigial tra region with the corresponding genes in the f plasmid allowed us to define the extent of the deletions that the s. enteritidis plasmid should have suffered. the putative replicons of the plasmid, repb and repc, were isolated and both proved to be functional in escherichia coli, but repc was segregationally unstable. the nucleotide sequence of repb showed the typical organization of repfiia replicons, although the similarity was lower than usual in this group of  replicons. the highest homology was found with the replicon of the virulence plasmid pyve439-80 from yersinia enterocolitica (72.5%). replicon repc also showed a maximum identity of 72.6% with known replicons, namely the repfib of pcolv-k30 and p307, both virulence plasmids isolated from e. coli. we conclude that the s. enteritidis plasmid could arise from the s. typhimurium plasmid through deletions, and that they are evolutionary distant from other incfi and incfii plasmids.

TI  == [oral pefloxacin in the treatment of acute gastroenteritis].
AB  == in the case of travellers' diarrhoea, in order to reduce to a minimum the period  of sickness and temporary invalidity, suitable therapy needs to be undertaken, involving the reintegration of fluids and electrolytes, as well as antibiotic treatment whose spectrum of action covers the most commonly isolated microorganisms. the aim of the study was to verify the rapidity of the antibacterial action of pefloxacin in the treatment of this type of gastrointestinal infection. materials and methods: the patients enrolled were treated for 5 days with pefloxacin in tablets containing 400 mg of the active agent, given orally. treatment involved a first dose of 800 mg (2 tablets in a single administration), followed by 400 mg twice a day (1 tablet every 12 hours). administration was carried out prevalently at mealtimes. at the end of treatment  a two-week follow-up period was scheduled. at the beginning of the study, and after 5 days' treatment, a coproculture was carried out, with identification of the germ responsible for the infection. the study was carried out in accordance with the principles of the helsinki declaration and its revisions, in particular  each patient gave his/her informed consent to participate in the trial. results:  thirty patients enrolled in the study (16 males, 14 females), of mean age 48.2 years (18-82 min-max), mean weight of 66.3 kg (46-88 min-max), suffering from acute gastroenteritis. the coproculture carried out at the baseline for all patients led to the isolation in 10 patients, of 10 pefloxacin-sensitive gram-negative bacterial strains: salmonella spp. in 6 cases, shigella spp. in 2,  escherichia coli in 1 and yersinia enterocolitica in 1. at the end of treatment and follow-up the coproculture indicated that all the germs isolated initially had been eradicated and no cases of superinfection or reinfection occurred. the number of daily evacuations gradually decreased from a mean of 6.8 at the baseline to 1.1 on the fifth day (p<0.0001). the consistency of faeces had increased in a significant fashion by the third day and at the end of treatment 93.3% of patients had well-formed faeces. in the course of treatment abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting decreased progressively and body temperature returned within normal limits by the third day. safety was excellent in 93.3% of patients, with one case of nausea and one of erythema, which resolved spontaneously in the  course of treatment. at the end of treatment with pefloxacin, the physician expressed his final judgment of efficacy, which was excellent in 86.7% of cases (26/30) and good in 13.3% (4/30), in accordance with the clinical evaluation of recovery in 93.3% of cases (28/30) and of improvement in 6.7% (2/30). conclusions: in forms of acute gastroenteritis in which coproculture shows the presence of germs sensitive to pefloxacin, the use of this quinolone guarantees a high percentage of success with a short course of treatment.

AB  == in this study, we identified the iron-transport systems of escherichia coli o157:h7 strain edl933. this strain synthesized and transported enterobactin and had a ferric citrate transport system but lacked the ability to produce or use aerobactin. it used haem and haemoglobin, but not transferrin or lactoferrin, as  iron sources. we cloned the gene encoding an iron-regulated haem-transport protein and showed that this e. coli haem-utilization gene (chua) encoded a 69 kda outer membrane protein that was synthesized in response to iron limitation. expression of this protein in a laboratory strain of e. coli was sufficient for utilization of haem or haemoglobin as iron sources. mutation of the chromosomal chua and tonb genes in e. coli o157:h7 demonstrated that the utilization of haemin and haemoglobin was chua- and tonb-dependent. nucleotide sequence analysis of chua revealed features characteristic of tonb-dependent, fur-regulated, outer  membrane iron-transport proteins. it was highly homologous to the shua gene of shigella dysenteriae and less closely related to hemr of yersinia enterocolitica  and hmur of yersinia pestis. a conserved fur box was identified upstream of the chua gene, and regulation by fur was confirmed.

TI  == identification and characterization of the dtdp-rhamnose biosynthesis and transfer genes of the lipopolysaccharide-related rfb locus in leptospira interrogans serovar copenhageni.
AB  == immunity to leptospirosis is principally humorally mediated and involves opsonization of leptospires for phagocytosis by macrophages and neutrophils. the  only protective antigen identified to date is the leptospiral lipopolysaccharide  (lps), which biochemically resembles typical gram-negative lps but has greatly reduced endotoxic activity. little is known about the structure of leptospiral lps. a 2.1-kb ecori fragment from the chromosome of serovar copenhageni was cloned in puc18 in escherichia coli, after which flanking regions were cloned from a genomic library constructed in bacteriophage lambda gem12. sequence analysis identified four open reading frames which showed similarity to the rfbc, rfbd, rfbb, and rfba genes, transcribed in that order, which encode the four enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of dtdp-rhamnose for the assembly of lps in  salmonella enterica, e. coli, and shigella flexneri. an additional open reading frame downstream of the rfbcdba locus showed similarity with the rhamnosyltransferase genes of shigella and yersinia enterocolitica but not salmonella. comparison of deduced amino acid sequences showed up to 85% similarity of the leptospiral proteins with those of other gram-negative bacteria. polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of recombinant clones identified the putative rfbcdba proteins, while reverse transcriptase-mediated pcr analysis indicated that the rfbcdba gene cluster was expressed in leptospira. moreover, it could restore normal lps phenotype to a defined rfbb::tn5 mutant of s. flexneri which was deficient in all four genes, thereby confirming the functional identification of a part of the leptospiral rfb locus.

AB  == the genus yersinia contains three pathogenic species: yersinia pestis, y. pseudotuberculosis, and y. enterocolitica. only a few biotypes and serotypes of y. enterocolitica are pathogenic, and these form two distinct groups: some are of low virulence, and they are encountered worldwide; others, mainly encountered in  north america, are markedly more virulent. all pathogenic yersiniae possess a 70-kb virulence plasmid called pyv which encodes secreted antihost proteins called yops as well as a type iii secretion machinery that is required for yop secretion. genes encoding yop synthesis and secretion are tightly clustered in three quadrants of the pyv plasmid. we show here that in the low-virulence strains of y. enterocolitica, the fourth quadrant of the plasmid contains a new class ii transposon, tn2502. this transposon encodes a defective transposase, but transposition can be complemented in trans by tn2501, another class ii transposon. tn2502 was not detected in the pyv plasmids of the more virulent american strains of y. enterocolitica, of y. pseudotuberculosis, and of y. pestis. tn2502 confers arsenite and arsenate resistance. this resistance involves four genes; three are homologous to the arsrbc genes present on the escherichia coli chromosome, but no homolog of the fourth one, arsh, has been found. the systematic presence of such a resistance operon on a virulence plasmid is unusual and could be related to the recent spread of low-virulence y. enterocolitica strains. the presence of this ars operon also constitutes the first significant difference between the pyv plasmids from different yersinia species.

TI  == [comparative study of the antigenic composition of brucella canis strains by immunoblotting].
AB  == brucella cultures isolated from sick dogs have not been properly studied in russia up to the present time. in 1994 a culture has been isolated from aborted fetus of a dog. investigations by the traditional methods referred it to brucella genus, species canis (strain k-01). reference strain b. canis rm6/66 and b. canis k-01 were identical by the profiles of protein antigens in immunoblotting with a  set of antibrucellosis sera. b. canis, b. suis, b. abortus, and b. melitensis. however, immunoblotting with sera to b. canis showed the similarity of b. canis cultures with the reference strain b. suis 1330, and use of sera to b. suis, b. abortus, and b. melitensis helped differentiate between the reference b. suis 1330 strain and b. canis strains. all the antisera used permitted the differentiation of brucella strains from yersinia enterocolitica 0:9, escherichia coli 0:157, and salmonella typhimurium cross reacting with brucella in serological tests. immunoblotting is a promising taxonomic criterion for identification of newly detected representatives of the brucella genus.

TI  == safe poultry meat production in the next century.
AB  == the revolutionary industrialisation of the poultry industry in the last 30 years  has made the food poultry meat available for large groups of consumers. due to its nutritional, sensory and economical characteristics, poultry meat is by far the most popular animal food product world-wide. epidemiological reports, however, incriminate poultry meat as a source for outbreaks of human food poisoning. the organisms involved are salmonella spp., campylobacter spp. and, to a lesser extent, listeria monocytogenes, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, yersinia enterocolitica, clostridium perfringens and aeromonas spp. contamination of the end-product with pathogenic microorganisms is a reflection of the contamination of the live birds and, therefore, measures to be taken by industry  to avoid contamination of the consumer-ready product should start at that level.  in terms of the critical control point approach of the haccp concept, the quantitative contribution of critical phases in the production chain towards end-product contamination should be estimated in order to take the necessary intervention or corrective steps. to guarantee the production of safe poultry meat, knowledge of the capability of microorganisms to colonise the gastrointestinal tract is needed and the use of vaccines, antimicrobials and competitive exclusion microfloras as well as the implementation of new processing technology should be encouraged.

TI  == molecular and chemical characterization of the lipopolysaccharide o-antigen and its role in the virulence of yersinia enterocolitica serotype o:8.
AB  == the y. enterocolitica o:8(yeo8) o-antigen repeat units consist of five sugar residues: n-acetyl-d-galactosamine (galnac), d-galactose (gal), d-mannose (man),  l-fucose (fuc), and 6-deoxy-d-gulose (6d-gul). the nucleotide sequence of the o-antigen gene cluster of the yeo8 strain 8081-c was determined. altogether, 18 open reading frames (orfs) were identified and shown to be essential for o-antigen biosynthesis. we previously characterized the 3'-end of the o-antigen gene cluster and identified four genes: two for gdp-man biosynthesis, one for udp-gal biosynthesis, and one for o-antigen polymerase. based on sequence similarity, tn5-insertion phenotypes and chemical analysis, the 14 new genes were assigned the following functions: four genes are involved in the biosynthesis of  cdp-6d-gul and two in gdp-fuc biosynthesis. five gene products were assigned sugar transferase functions and one gene product was similar to wzx, the o-antigen flippase. two genes remained unassigned. by genetic complementation we  also showed that yeo8 o-antigen biosynthesis was dependent on n-acetyl-glucosaminyl:undecaprenylphosphate transferase (glcnac transferase), the weca (formerly known as rfe) protein. data obtained from chemical-composition analysis suggest that in addition to being glcnac transferase, weca may also function as a galnac transferase. using a restriction-deficient derivative of y.  enterocolitica o:8 strain 8081, a rough mutant, designated 8081-r2, was isolated. 8081-r2 was complemented in trans with a cloned o-antigen gene cluster restoring  surface o-antigen expression. the virulence of the wild-type strain and that of the complemented strain were significantly higher (approx. 100-fold) than that of the rough mutant in an orally infected mouse model, showing that yeo8 o-antigen is a virulence factor.

TI  == characterization of a large chromosomal "high-pathogenicity island" in biotype 1b yersinia enterocolitica.
AB  == pathogenic yersinia spp. can be subdivided into highly pathogenic (high-pathogenicity) and low-pathogenicity strains. several genes specific for the high-pathogenicity strains are clustered on a chromosomal fragment designated a "high-pathogenicity island" (hpi). in the present work, the hpi of biotype 1b strain ye 8081 of y. enterocolitica was characterized. we demonstrate important differences from the hpi of y. pestis. the hpi of y. enterocolitica is smaller (45 kb) and is not flanked by insertion sequences. a copy of the gene coding for  the trna-asn is present at one extremity of the hpi and may, as in uropathogenic  escherichia coli, participate in the excision of the island. in addition to the genes encoding the yersiniabactin-pesticin receptor and the high-molecular-weight protein 2, four repeated sequences are present on the hpi of y. enterocolitica. at least two of them are insertion elements: previously described is1328 and newly characterized is1400. comparison of the hpi of strain ye 8081 with that of  other y. enterocolitica strains of biotype 1b indicates that most of the island is conserved, apart from 15 kb at the left-hand end which is variable, especially in the region where three repeated sequences are clustered.

TI  == outer membrane differences between pathogenic and environmental yersinia enterocolitica biogroups probed with hydrophobic permeants and polycationic peptides.
AB  == sensitivities to polycationic peptides and edta were compared in yersinia enterocolitica pathogenic and environmental biogroups. as shown by changes in permeability to the fluorescent hydrophobic probe n-phenylnaphthylamine (npn), the outer membranes (oms) of pathogenic and environmental strains grown at 26 degrees c in standard broth were more resistant to poly-l-lysine, poly-l-ornithine, melittin, cecropin p1, polymyxin b, and edta than escherichia coli oms. at 37 degrees c, oms of pathogenic biogroups were resistant to edta and polycations and oms of environmental strains were resistant to edta whereas e. coli oms were sensitive to both edta and polycations. similar results were found  when testing deoxycholate sensitivity after polycation exposure or when isogenic  pairs with or without virulence plasmid pyv were compared. with bacteria grown without ca++ available, om permeability to npn was drastically increased in pathogenic but not in environmental strains or e. coli. under these conditions, oms of pyv+ and pyv- cells showed small differences in npn permeability but differences in polycation sensitivity could not be detected by fluorimetry. o:1,6 (environmental type) lipopolysaccharide (lps), but not o:3 or o:8 lps, was markedly rough at 37 degrees c, and this could explain the differences in polycation sensitivity. lpss from serotypes o:3 and o:8 grown at 37 degrees c were more permeable to npn than o:1,6 lps, and o:8 lps was resistant to polycation-induced permeabilization. these data suggest that lpss relate to some  but not all the om differences described. it is hypothesized that the different om properties of environmental and pathogenic biogroups reflect the adaptation of the latter biogroups to pathogenicity.

TI  == a bifunctional urease enhances survival of pathogenic yersinia enterocolitica and morganella morganii at low ph.
AB  == to infect a susceptible host, the gastrointestinal pathogen yersinia enterocolitica must survive passage through the acid environment of the stomach.  in this study, we showed that y. enterocolitica serotype o8 survives buffered acidic conditions as low as ph 1.5 for long periods of time provided urea is available. acid tolerance required an unusual cytoplasmically located urease that was activated 780-fold by low-ph conditions. acid tolerance of helicobacter species has also been attributed to urease activity, but in that case urease was  not specifically activated by low-ph conditions. a ure mutant strain of y. enterocolitica was constructed which was hypersensitive to acidic conditions when urea was available and, unlike the parental strain, was unable to grow when urea  was the sole nitrogen source. examination of other urease-producing gram-negative bacteria indicated that morganella morganii survives in acidic conditions but escherichia coli 1021, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, providencia stuartii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa do not. consistent with these results, biochemical evidence demonstrated that y. enterocolitica and m. morganii ureases  were activated in vitro by low ph with an unusually low activity optimum of ph 5.5. in whole cells activation occurred as medium values decreased below ph 3.0 for y. enterocolitica and ph 5.5 for m. morganii, suggesting that in vivo activation occurs as a result of cytoplasmic acidification. dna sequence analysis of portions of the m. morganii ure locus showed that the predicted primary structure of the enzyme structural subunits is most similar to those of y. enterocolitica urease. one region of similarity between these two ureases located near the active site is distinct from most other ureases but is present in the urease of lactobacillus fermentum. this region of similarity may be responsible for the unique properties of the y. enterocolitica and m. morganii ureases since  the l. fermentum urease also has been shown to have a low ph optimum for activity.

TI  == attempted definition by immunoblotting of the causes of reactivity in suspected false-positive sera in the brucella ovis complement fixation test.
AB  == seventy-nine suspected false-positive sera, obtained over 1 year from routine submissions for brucella ovis serological testing, were used in this study. these sera, which exhibited titres in the complement fixation test, but which because of their epidemiological history and their reactions in the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and gel diffusion test were suspected to be false positives,  were further analysed by immunoblotting. in blots, using b. ovis antigens, rough  lipopolysaccharide was identified as the major, immuno-reactive bacterial component. antibodies against this macromolecule were present in 46.8% of the suspected false-positive sera. in order to find out if rough lipopolysaccharides  from other bacterial species could be the possible cause for the suspected false  positivity, 23 sera with highest complement fixation titres were reacted in blots with cell extracts from escherichia coli, yersinia enterocolitica, yersinia pseudotuberculosis, bortedella bronchiseptica, actinobacillus seminis, campylobacter fetus fetus, campylobacter jejuni, mycobacterium paratuberculosis,  mycobacterium phlei, corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis and pure lipopolysaccharides from escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium. despite high frequencies of antibody reaction with proteins in most of these bacterial cell extracts, which reflect the presence of infections with these bacteria, immuno-staining in the rough lipopolysaccharide region was not observed.

TI  == enteropathogens associated with childhood diarrhea in italy. the italian study group on gastrointestinal infections.
AB  == background: infectious diarrheal diseases remain an important cause of childhood  morbidity in industrialized countries. the knowledge of the etiology and epidemiology of childhood diarrhea in a given area is needed to plan any measure  designed to prevent or ameliorate diarrheal illness and to develop practice guidelines for the most appropriate stool examination procedures. methods: we evaluated 618 children with diarrhea and 135 controls prospectively for viral, bacterial and parasitic enteric pathogens. diarrheagenic escherichia coli was identified by gene probes specific to different virulence factors. stool filtrates were examined for the presence of free bacterial toxins by a cell culture cytotoxicity assay. clinical and epidemiologic data were recorded and analyzed in relation to microbiologic findings. results: enteropathogens were identified in 59% of children with diarrhea and in 10.4% of asymptomatic controls. the agents mainly associated with disease were rotavirus (23.6%), salmonella (19.2%) and campylobacter (7.9%). rotavirus was significantly more frequent among children observed as inpatients whereas campylobacter was significantly more common in outpatients. infections with diarrheagenic e. coli,  shigella flexneri, yersinia enterocolitica, cryptosporidium and giardia were observed in a limited number of patients. the clinical presentation of children was not sufficiently characteristic to permit presumptive diagnosis of a specific pathogen. conversely the presence of blood and/or leukocytes in stools had a high positive predictive value for salmonella or campylobacter infection. conclusion:  the results of this study will be useful for planning strategies to prevent and control diarrheal diseases in our country.

AB  == a case control study of foal diarrhoea in the united kingdom was carried out over a 3-year period. clostridium perfringens was significantly associated with foal diarrhoea (odds ratio (or) = 3.0), being isolated from 57% of 421 animals with diarrhoea but from only 27% of 223 healthy foals. also, c. perfringens was significantly associated with fatal diarrhoea (or = 4.5). about half of diarrhoea with a fatal outcome was attributable to this organism. the other pathogens significantly associated with diarrhoea were rotavirus (or = 5.6), cryptosporidium spp. (or = 3.2) and the nematode strongyloides westeri, which was significant only when present in large numbers (> 2000 eggs/g of faeces: or = 6.1). salmonella spp. (or = 14.2) and cryptosporidium spp. (or = 3.0) were the only other pathogens associated with fatal illness. overall, c. perfringens, rotavirus, and large numbers of cryptosporidium spp. or s. westeri were isolated  from 80% of foals with diarrhoea. thermophilic campylobacter spp., yersinia enterocolitica, escherichia coli and other parasites were not associated with diarrhoea. carriage of c. perfringens, rotavirus and cryptosporidium spp. was significantly greater in healthy foals in contact with cases of diarrhoea than in foals that were not in contact with diarrhoea (p < 0.05). there were no statistical interactions between any of the pathogens associated with diarrhoea although separate cases from one location often involved more than one pathogen.

TI  == identification of the gale gene and a gale homolog and characterization of their  roles in the biosynthesis of lipopolysaccharide in a serotype o:8 strain of yersinia enterocolitica.
AB  == a clone that complements mutations in yersinia enterocolitica lipopolysaccharide  (lps) core biosynthesis was isolated, and the dna sequence of the clone was determined. three complete open reading frames and one partial open reading frame were located on the cloned dna fragment. the first, partial, open reading frame had homology to the rfbk gene. the remaining reading frames had homology to gale, rol, and gsk. analysis of the gale homolog indicates that although it can complement an escherichia coli gale mutant, its primary function in y. enterocolitica is not in the production of udp galactose but, instead, some other nucleotide sugar required for lps biosynthesis. this gene has been renamed lse, for lps sugar epimerase. the rol homolog has been demonstrated to have a role in  y. enterocolitica serotype 0:8 o-polysaccharide antigen chain length determination. an additional gale homolog has been identified in y. enterocolitica by homology to the e. coli gene. the product of this gene has udp  galactose 4-epimerase activity in both e. coli and y. enterocolitica. this gene is linked to the other genes of the galactose utilization pathway, similar to what is seen in other members of the family enterobacteriaceae. although y. enterocolitica 0:8 strains are reported to have galactose as a constituent of lps, a strain containing a mutation in this gale gene does not exhibit any lps defects.

AB  == the cloned afu locus of actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae restored the ability of an escherichia coli k-12 mutant (arob) to grow on iron-limited media. dna sequence analysis of the fragment showed that there are three genes designated afua, afub and afuc (actinobacillus ferric uptake) that encode products similar to the sfuabc proteins of serratia marcescens, the hitabc proteins of haemophilus influenzae, the fbpabc proteins of neisseria gonorrhoeae and the yfuabc proteins  of yersinia enterocolitica. the three genes encode a periplasmic iron-binding protein (afua), a highly hydrophobic integral cytoplasmic membrane protein with two consensus permease motifs (afub) and one hydrophilic peripheral cytoplasmic membrane protein with walker atp-binding motifs (afuc), respectively. this system has been shown to constitute a periplasmic binding protein-dependent iron transport system in these organisms. the afuabc operon is locating approximately  200 bp upstream of apxic gene, but transcribed in opposite direction to the apxi-toxin genes.

TI  == identification and characterization of the yersinia enterocolitica gsra gene, which protectively responds to intracellular stress induced by macrophage phagocytosis and to extracellular environmental stress.
AB  == yersinia enterocolitica is able to resist the microbicidal mechanisms of macrophages and to grow within phagocytic cells. some bacteria including y. enterocolitica have been shown to respond to the hostile environment in macrophages by producing a set of stress proteins which are also induced by environmental stresses. to understand the role of stress proteins in intracellular survival of bacteria, we identified and cloned a y. enterocolitica  gene, called gsra (global stress requirement). the gsra gene was identified because its insertional inactivation by a transposon resulted in the inability of the organism to grow at an elevated temperature and to survive within macrophages after phagocytosis. the gsra gene was sequenced and shown to encode a basic, 49,500-da protein. the gsra protein shows significant amino acid sequence homology to the htra stress protein which was originally identified in escherichia coli. furthermore, the genetically defined y. enterocolitica gsra mutant was constructed and characterized. the insertional mutation of gsra resulted in inhibition of growth at temperatures above 39 degrees c and greatly increased susceptibility to oxidative and osmotic stresses. the mutant additionally lost the ability to survive and replicate within macrophages. these  results, taken together, indicate that the gsra gene is an essential component of the protection mechanism employed by y. enterocolitica, allowing it to respond to the intracellular stress in macrophages as well as extracellular environmental stress.

TI  == yersinia-hsp60-reactive t cells are efficiently stimulated by peptides of 12 and  13 amino acid residues in a mhc class ii (i-ab)-restricted manner.
AB  == heat shock proteins (hsp) are immunodominant antigens in microbial infections. previous work from this laboratory demonstrated that yersinia-hsp60 (y-hsp60)-reactive cd4+ alpha beta t cells play an important role for resolution  of y. enterocolitica infections in mice. in the present study we identified two epitopes of y-hsp60 recognized by cd4+ th1 cell clones. the epitopes comprise 12  (214-225) and 13 (74-86) amino acid (aa) residues of y-hsp60, and are the first described for mhc class ii (i-ab) molecules. both epitopes are also recognized by t cells isolated from mesenteric lymph nodes from mice orogastrically infected with yersiniae. stimulation of t cells with peptides of 12 and 13 aa residues of  y-hsp60 caused highly efficient proliferation compared with longer peptides, full-length recombinant y-hsp60, or heat-killed yersinia (hky). incubation of antigen-presenting cells with chloroquine blocked both peptide and hky-triggered  t cell proliferation, whereas cytochalasin b only blocked hky-induced proliferation and to a lesser extent peptide-induced proliferation. the identified epitopes reside in a region of y-hsp60 that is conserved between enterobacteriaceae but highly variable when compared with murine or human hsp60.  although both epitopes are identical to the related sequence of hsp60 (groel) of  escherichia coli, only weak t cell responses were observed upon stimulation with  groel of e. coli, suggesting that other factors, e.g. flanking amino acid residues, might be important for antigen processing and t cell stimulation in a class ii-restricted manner. furthermore, these observations might be of significance for the rational design of subunit vaccines.

TI  == complementation of the hha mutation in escherichia coli by the ymoa gene from yersinia enterocolitica: dependence on the gene dosage.
AB  == the hha protein from escherichia coli is highly similar (82%) to the ymoa protein from yersinia enterocolitica. both are members of a new class of proteins that modulates gene expression, probably by influencing dna topology. in this paper, complementation of the hha mutation in e. coli by the ymoa gene from y. enterocolitica has been studied. we show that the ymoa gene complements one of the phenotypic properties of hha mutants (high level of haemolysin production when they carry the recombinant plasmid pann202-312) when cloned in a medium-copy-number plasmid but not when carried in a low-copy-number plasmid. western blot analysis of the expression of ymoa in e. coli rules out inefficient  expression of the protein. surprisingly, the hha gene itself fails to complement  the hha mutation when cloned in a medium-copy-number vector and causes genetic rearrangements of the e. coli chromosome as a consequence of insertion sequences  mobilization.

TI  == a simple gel electrophoretic method for analyzing the muropeptide composition of  bacterial peptidoglycan.
AB  == the muropeptide composition of bacterial peptidoglycan is currently most efficiently determined by reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography (hplc). though sensitive, the hplc procedure is technically demanding and has been applied to a relatively small number of bacterial strains and species. we have found that fluorescence-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis (face) is a simple, rapid method by which reducing muropeptides from multiple peptidoglycan samples can be visualized. individual reducing muropeptides were covalently labeled with the fluorescent molecule 8-aminonaphthalene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid,  after which they were separated by electrophoresis through a 35% polyacrylamide gel and visualized by exposure to uv light. face detected the appropriate numbers of reducing muropeptides in the proper proportions for four bacteria: escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter cloacae, and yersinia enterocolitica.  as little as 2 to 5 pmol per muropeptide was detected when the intensity of the fluorescent signal was measured with a charge-coupled device camera, at a level of sensitivity between 50 and 250 times higher than that of the classic hplc technique. thus, face may be used to identify interesting peptidoglycan samples prior to more-extensive analysis by hplc, or face may eventually replace hplc for some applications.

TI  == antimicrobial effect of acidified nitrite on gut pathogens: importance of dietary nitrate in host defense.
AB  == dietary intake of nitrate generates salivary nitrite, which is acidified in the stomach, leading to a number of reactive intermediates of nitrogen, among which are the potentially carcinogenic n-nitrosamines. acidified nitrite, however, also has antimicrobial activity which coincides with the formation of nitric oxide. the present study examines the antimicrobial effect in vitro of acidified nitrite on salmonella enteritidis, salmonella typhimurium, yersinia enterocolitica, shigella sonnei, and escherichia coli o157. first-order regression plots showed a linear inverse relationship of log-transformed proton and nitrite concentrations  with mics and mbcs after 30 min, 2 h, and 24 h of exposure (p < 0.001 for all antibacterial activities). susceptibility to the acidified nitrate solutions ranked as follows: y. enterocolitica > s. enteritidis > s. typhimurium = shigella sonnei > e. coli o157 (p < 0.05). addition of scn-, but not that of ci-, increased the antibacterial activity (paired t testing, p < 0.001). generation of salivary nitrite from dietary nitrate may provide significant protection against  gut pathogens in humans.

TI  == identification of a domain in rck, a product of the salmonella typhimurium virulence plasmid, required for both serum resistance and cell invasion.
AB  == rck is encoded on the salmonella typhimurium virulence plasmid and is a member of a family of related 17- to 19-kda outer membrane proteins of enterobacteriaceae,  including ail (yersinia enterocolitica) and pagc (s. typhimurium). structural models for these proteins predict eight membrane-spanning domains alternating with hydrophilic inner and outer loops. when expressed in escherichia coli, rck and ail, but not pagc, confer high-level resistance to the bactericidal activity  of complement as well as the ability to adhere to and invade mammalian cell lines. to identify functional domains of rck, we made and screened random mutations in rck for decreased bioactivity. we found that a single amino acid substitution (glycine to aspartic acid) in the putative third outer loop greatly  reduced rck-mediated serum resistance and eukaryotic cell invasion. we then constructed two chimeric proteins between rck and pagc. substitution of the c-terminal half of rck with the corresponding pagc fragment containing both the third and the fourth outer loops abolishes the rck-mediated serum resistance and  invasion phenotypes. substitution of rck with a smaller c-terminal portion of pagc containing the fourth outer loop did not affect the invasive phenotype or serum resistance. these data reveal that the third putative outer membrane loop region is important for the virulence-associated properties of the rck protein and suggest a similarity between the mechanism of serum resistance and epithelial cell invasion involving the same domain of rck.

TI  == the hmu locus of yersinia pestis is essential for utilization of free haemin and  haem--protein complexes as iron sources.
AB  == yersinia pestis strains utilize haem and several haem-protein complexes as sole sources of iron. in this study, the haemin uptake locus (hmu) of y. pestis kim6+  was selected from a genomic library by transduction into an escherichia coli siderophore synthesis (entc) mutant. recombinant plasmids containing a common 16  kb bamhi insert were isolated that allowed e. coli entc to use haemin as an iron  source. an 8.6 kb region of this insert was found to be essential for haemin utilization and encoded at least five proteins with molecular masses of 79/77, 44, 37, 35, and 30/27.5 kda. a 10.9 kb clal fragment containing the hmu locus showed varying degrees of homology to genomic dna from yersinia pseudotuberculosis, yersinia enterocolitica, and other genera of enterobacteriaceae. an e. coli hema arob strain harbouring cloned hmu genes used  haemin as both an iron and porphyrin source but only on iron-poor medium, suggesting that haemin uptake is tightly iron regulated. additionally, haemoglobin and myoglobin were used as iron sources by an e. coli entc (phmu2.2)  strain. deletion of the hmu locus from y. pestis kim6+ chromosome generated a mutant that grew poorly on iron-depleted medium containing free haemin as well as mammalian haem-protein complexes including haemoglobin, haemoglobin-haptoglobin,  myoglobin, haem-haemopexin, and haem-albumin unless it was complemented with cloned hmu genes.

AB  == bacteriological analysis of 713 samples of various types of foods and related articles and potable water samples from different places in ludhiana, punjab was  carried out. the highest counts ranging from 2.5 x 10(6)-7.5 x 10(8) organisms/g  were observed in raw vegetables and fruits, followed by 3 x 10(6)-9.8 x 10(7)/ml, 8.3 x 10(4)-8.9 x 10(7)/g and 1 x 10(3)-6.7 x 10(7)/g in fruit juice, milk and its products, and salty/non milk snacks respectively. fresh chapati, dal, rice, cooked vegetables and karhi etc., showed no microbial contamination. however, samples of these articles from road side cafes gave counts up to 1 x 10(7) organism/g. the most probable number of coliforms and escherichia coli/100 ml of  water ranged from < 1 to > 1100. although 1332 isolates of 16 types of organisms  of public health significance were obtained those of proven enteropathogenicity were enterotoxigenic esch. coli (55), esch. coli o157 (3), enteropathogenic esch. coli (1), enterotoxigenic klebsiella (23), streptococcus faecalis (152), bacillus cereus (133), staphylococcus aureus (125), aeromonas spp (47), salmonella spp (10), shigella spp (4) and yersinia enterocolitica (2). poor quality of potable water and widespread occurrence of enteropathogens in food consumed by the common man in ludhiana was evident.

TI  == enteroaggregative escherichia coli heat-stable enterotoxin is not restricted to enteroaggregative e. coli.
AB  == enteroaggregative escherichia coli (eaggec) have been implicated as diarrheal pathogens in several settings. some eaggec produce a distinct heat-stable enterotoxin named east1. the distribution and prevalence of the east1 gene in selected groups of bacterial enteropathogens were determined by colony hybridization. one hundred percent of 75 o157:h7 enterohemorrhagic e. coli (ehec), 41% of 227 eaggec, 41% of 149 enterotoxigenic e. coli, 22% of 65 enteropathogenic e. coli (epec), and 38% of 47 e. coli stool isolates from asymptomatic children hybridized with an east1 dna probe. none of 55 enteroinvasive e. coli, 12 yersinia enterocolitica, or 20 vibrio cholerae non-o1  strains were east1 probe-positive. concordance between east1 genotype and enterotoxicity was shown in examined strains of eaggec, ehec, and epec. the gene  encoding east1 is more broadly distributed among diarrheogenic e. coli than previously known and may represent an additional determinant in the pathogenesis  of e. coli diarrhea.

TI  == discriminatory power and application of ribotyping of yersinia enterocolitica o:3 in an epidemiological study.
AB  == ribotyping performed with five restriction endonucleases was used in an attempt to subtype yersinia enterocolitica serotype o:3 and also as a tool for clonal analysis. dna from organisms under study (48 isolates from diarrheic human feces, 24 from food, and 5 reference strains) was tested by southern hybridization using a dna probe carrying an rrna operon from escherichia coli. strains were grouped into seven ribotypes by the hindiii restriction endonuclease, into five ribotypes by ncil, bg/l, and sa/l; and into two ribotypes by ecori, resulting in a discrimination index (di) of 0.37, 0.17, 0.43, 0.13, and 0.03 for the five endonucleases. by combining the results obtained with two or more restriction endonucleases, a further discrimination was registered, the most efficient combination (in terms of discriminatory power vs. cost in work, time, and money)  for routine typing being hindiii-bg/l (9 types, di=0.58). in the clonal analysis, results obtained with the five restriction endonucleases allowed us to define 11  groupings or clonal lines, which showed a remarkable degree of genetic heterogeneity (genetic distance coefficients between 0.03 and 0.73) and were grouped into two major clusters. one cluster included 93% of the strains and eight lines. at least two of the most frequent lines can be considered endemic in asturias, spain, because organisms belonging to these lines have been circulating and causing human yersiniosis in recent years and have also been isolated from commercial raw meat products. two ncil ribotypes from the series under study (92.2% of strains included in the prevalent cluster) were similar but not identical to ribotypes of 0.3 organisms from other geographic areas described in  the literature, indicating that the genetic structure of prevalent human pathogens of this serotype is basically clonal.

TI  == identification of tonb homologs in the family enterobacteriaceae and evidence for conservation of tonb-dependent energy transduction complexes.
AB  == the transport of fe(iii)-siderophore complexes and vitamin b12 across the outer membrane of escherichia coli requires the tonb-dependent energy transduction system. a set of murine monoclonal antibodies (mabs) was generated against an e.  coli trpc-tonb fusion protein to facilitate structure and function studies. in the present study, the epitopes recognized by these mabs were mapped, and their distribution in gram-negative organisms was examined. cross-species reactivity patterns obtained against tonb homologs of known sequence were used to refine epitope mapping, with some epitopes ultimately confirmed by inhibition experiments using synthetic polypeptides. epitopes recognized by this set of mabs were conserved in tonb homologs for 9 of 12 species in the family enterobacteriaceae (including e. coli), including previously unidentified tonb homologs in shigella, citrobacter, proteus, and kluyvera species. these homologs  were also detected by a polyclonal alpha-trpc-tonb serum that additionally recognized the known yersinia enterocolitica tonb homolog and a putative tonb homolog in edwardsiella tarda. these antibody preparations failed to detect the known tonb homologs of either pseudomonas putida or haemophilus influenzae but did identify potential tonb homologs in several other nonenteric gram-negative species. in vivo chemical cross-linking experiments demonstrated that in addition to tonb, auxiliary components of the tonb-dependent energy transduction system are broadly conserved in members of the family enterobacteriaceae, suggesting that the tonb system represents a common system for high-affinity active transport across the gram-negative outer membrane.

TI  == the gene cluster directing o-antigen biosynthesis in yersinia enterocolitica serotype 0:8: identification of the genes for mannose and galactose biosynthesis  and the gene for the o-antigen polymerase.
AB  == the rfb gene cluster of yersinia enterocolitica serotype o:8 (yeo8) strain 8081-c was cloned by cosmid cloning. restriction mapping, deletion analysis and transposon mutagenesis showed that about 19 kb of the cloned dna is essential for the synthesis and expression of the yeo8 o-side-chain in escherichia coli. deletion analysis generated a derivative that expressed semi-rough lps, a phenotype typical of an rfc mutant lacking the o-antigen polymerase. the deletions and transcomplementation experiments allowed localization of the rfc gene to the 3'-end of the rfb gene cluster. the deduced yeo8 rfc did not share significant amino acid sequence similarity with any other protein, but its amino  acid composition and hydrophobicity profile are similar to those of identified rfc proteins. in addition, the codon usage of the rfc gene is similar to other rfc genes. nucleotide sequence analysis identified three other genes upstream of  rfc. two of the gene products showed 60-70% identity to the rfbm and rfbk proteins that are biosynthetic enzymes for the gdpmannose pathway of enterobacteria. the third gene product was about 50-80% identical to the bacterial gale protein, udpglucose 4-epimerase, which catalyses the epimerization of udpglucose to udpgalactose. since mannose and galactose are both present in the yeo8 o-antigen repeat unit, the above three genes are likely to belong to the rfb gene cluster. a gene similar to the gsk gene downstream of rfc, and genes similar to adk and hemh upstream of the rfb gene cluster, were recognized. thus the rfb gene cluster of yeo8 is located between the adk-hemh and gsk loci, and the order is adk-hemh-rfb-rfc-gsk in the chromosome. also in other yersinia spp., the locus downstream of the hemh gene is occupied by gene clusters associated with lps biosynthesis.

TI  == analysis of the erwinia chrysanthemi ferrichrysobactin receptor gene: resemblance to the escherichia coli fepa-fes bidirectional promoter region and homology with  hydroxamate receptors.
AB  == the fct cbsceba operon from the erwinia chrysanthemi 3937 chrysobactin-dependent  iron assimilation system codes for transport and biosynthetic functions. the sequence of the fct outer membrane receptor gene was determined. the fct promoter region displays a strong resemblance to the escherichia coli bidirectional intercistronic region controlling the expression of the fepa-entd and fes-entf operons. an apparent fur-binding site was shown to confer iron regulation on an fct::lac fusion expressed on a low-copy-number plasmid in a fur-proficient e. coli strain. the fct gene consists of an open reading frame encoding a 735-amino-acid polypeptide with a signal sequence of 38 residues. the fct protein has 36% sequence homology with the e. coli ferrichrome receptor fhua and the yersinia enterocolitica ferrioxamine receptor foxa. on the basis of secondary-structure predictions and these homologies, we propose a two-dimensional folding model for fct.

TI  == interruption of microbial cycles in farm animals from farm to table.
AB  == the fact that only slight problems are posed by salmonella, campylobacter and escherichia coli o157 in mammalian farm animals in norway, is undoubtedly due in  large degree to the agricultural set-up with small farms and small herds, allowing a good overview of the situation at any time. other factors are the very limited import of breeding animals and food products of animal origin, microbiological control of animal feed, and favourable geographical and climatic  conditions. however, the norwegian meat industry (including abattoirs) has continuing problems with yersinia enterocolitica o:3 in pigs and pig meat, and in some cases with listeria monocytogenes in cold cuts and toxoplasma gondii in sheep meat (lamb). these three agents are therefore used to illustrate appropriate measures to be taken at the herd level on the farm, in abattoirs and  in the meat processing industry.

TI  == yst gene expression in yersinia enterocolitica is positively regulated by a chromosomal region that is highly homologous to escherichia coli host factor 1 gene (hfq).
AB  == yersinia enterocolitica produces heat-stable enterotoxin (y-st) as one of its virulence factors. the yst gene, however, frequently and spontaneously becomes inactive (silent) during storage, which is accompanied by concurrent changes in some biological properties such as colony morphology, growth rate, carbon fermentation and ornithine decarboxylase activity. northern blot analysis revealed that the level of mrna for yst was repressed. to investigate the regulatory region, we transformed a yst-silent strain with a chromosomal gene library of y-st producing an isogenic counterpart. out of 3604 clones, one clone  resumed the y-st production and concurrently other biological properties. an open reading frame in this clone was designated as yrp, yersinia regulator for pleiotropic phenotype. deduced from the nucleotide sequence, yrp was a small protein of i01 amino acids with no similarity with any regulatory factor described, but showed high homology with an escherichia coli host factor 1 required for q beta-replicase, and with an azorhizobium caulinodans nrfa required for the expression of nifa. the yrp gene mutation caused decreased negative supercoiling of plasmids, as did hfq. the yrp gene could similarly complement y-st production in two other silent strains of y. enterocolitica. in all three silent strains examined, we found various mutations in the yrp region.

TI  == [water disinfection: comparative activities of ozone and chlorine on a wide spectrum of bacteria].
AB  == ozone and chlorine are agents that disinfect by destroying, neutralizing or inhibiting the growth of pathogenic microorganisms. the treatment of drinking water with ozone has shown to be more efficient against spores of bacillus subtilis. it was observed that the ozone already in dose of 0.35 mg/l produced the reduction of at least 5 log in populations of approximately 1 x 10(6) cells/ml of escherichia coli, vibrio cholerae, salmonella typhi, yersinia enterocolitica, pseudomonas aeruginosa, aeromonas hydrophila, listeria monocytogenes and staphylococcus aureus. with a dose of 0.50 mg/l of chlorine, the reduction was much smaller for the tested microorganisms (except vibrio cholerae), while the effect of 2 mg/l of chlorine was similar to the ozone treatment. for spores of bacillus subtilis, the reduction observed with ozone concentrations of 0.35 and 0.70 mg/l was of almost 3 log, while no considerable effect was obtained with chlorine in the tested conditions. our results have shown that both disinfectans were consumed during the treatment period, probably  because of the own water demand and the added bacterial mass.

TI  == interactions of yersinia enterocolitica with polarized human intestinal caco-2 cells.
AB  == the in vitro interactions of yersinia enterocolitica, salmonella typhimurium and  escherichia coli with polarized human colonic carcinoma (caco-2) cells are described. invasion of a confluent caco-2 cell monolayer by yersinia and salmonella took place within 4 h after contact, which was in marked contrast to e. coli which did not invade caco-2 cells. cytoplasmic extrusions developed on the apical membrane and indicated the site of entrance of bacteria into the caco-2 cells. intracellular yersinia and salmonella were surrounded by a vacuolar membrane. single as well as multiple bacteria were enclosed within a single vacuole. at 6 h after contact some of the intracellular yersiniae were found free in the cytoplasm. furthermore, morphological signs of degeneration of caco-2 cells such as vacuolization and autophagy were observed. caco-2 cells infected with salmonella also showed degenerative changes but the salmonellae resided within membrane-bound vacuoles in contrast to yersinia. these observations are in contrast to those described for the invasion of other cells lines (not derived from intestinal epithelium) by yersinia and may reflect more closely the interactions between yersinia and the intestinal epithelium during gastrointestinal infection.

TI  == analyses of the dna-binding and transcriptional activation properties of exsa, the transcriptional activator of the pseudomonas aeruginosa exoenzyme s regulon.
AB  == exsa has been implicated as a central regulator of exoenzyme s production by pseudomonas aeruginosa. in this study, the dna-binding and transcriptional activation properties of exsa were investigated. exsa was produced and purified as a fusion protein, mala3a2, which was shown to bind specifically to promoter regions that regulated transcription of the exoenzyme s trans-regulatory locus (pc) and a locus located directly downstream of exsa (pd). previously, mala3a2 was shown to bind the exos 5' psti-nsii region, which contained two independent but coordinately regulated (exsa-mediated) promoters, ps' (now termed porf1) and  ps. dnase i footprint analysis of the promoter regions bound by exsa revealed a common protected consensus sequence of txaaaaxa. the consensus sequence was located -51 to -52 bp upstream of the transcriptional start sites for pd, ps, and porf1. promoter fusion, dna-binding, and mutagenesis analysis indicated that the  consensus sequence was important for transcriptional activation. each exsa-controlled promoter region contained at least two consensus sites in close proximity, similar to the arrangement of half-sites seen in arac-controlled (escherichia coli) or virf-controlled (yersinia enterocolitica) promoters. however, the results of this study suggested that only one consensus site was required in the exoenzyme s (ps) or orf1 promoter (porf1) to initiate transcription. these data suggest that members of the exoenzyme s regulon can be  defined as possessing an exsa consensus element which maps at bp -51 or -52 relative to the transcriptional start site.

TI  == the outer membranes of brucella spp. are resistant to bactericidal cationic peptides.
AB  == the actions of polymyxin b, rabbit polymorphonuclear lysosome extracts, 14 polycationic peptides (including defensin np-2, cecropin p1, lactoferricin b, and active peptides from cationic protein 18 and bactenecin), edta, and tris on brucella spp. were studied, with other gram-negative bacteria as controls. brucella spp. were comparatively resistant to all of the agents listed above and  bound less polymyxin b, and their outer membranes (oms) were neither morphologically altered nor permeabilized to lysozyme by polymyxin b concentrations, although both effects were observed for controls. edta and peptides increased or accelerated the partition of the hydrophobic probe n-phenyl-naphthylamine into escherichia coli and haemophilus influenzae oms but had no effect on brucella oms. since brucella and h. influenzae oms are permeable to hydrophobic compounds (g. martinez de tejada and i. moriyon, j. bacteriol. 175:5273-5275, 1993), the results show that such unusual permeability is not necessarily related to resistance to polycations. although rough (r) b. abortus and b. ovis were more resistant than the controls were, there were qualitative and quantitative differences with smooth (s) brucellae; this may explain known host range and virulence differences. brucella s-lipopolysaccharides (lpss) had reduced affinities for polycations, and insertion of brucella and salmonella montevideo s-lpss into the om of a brucella r-lps mutant increased and decreased, respectively, its resistance to cationic peptides. the results show that the core lipid a of brucella lps plays a major role in polycation resistance and that o-chain density also contributes significantly. it is proposed that the features  described above contribute to brucella resistance to the oxygen-independent systems of phagocytes.

AB  == sensitivity to yersinia pestis bacteriocin pesticin correlates with the existence of two groups of human pathogenic yersiniae, mouse lethal and mouse nonlethal. the presence of the outer membrane pesticin receptor (fyua) in mouse-lethal yersiniae is a prerequisite for pesticin sensitivity. genes that code for fyua (fyua) were identified and sequenced from pesticin-sensitive bacteria, including  y. enterocolitica biotype 1b (serotypes o8; o13, o20, and o21), y. pseudotuberculosis serotype o1, y. pestis, two known pesticin-sensitive escherichia coli isolates (e. coli phi and e. coli ca42), and two newly discovered pesticin-sensitive isolates, e. coli k49 and k235. a 2,318-bp fyua sequence was shown to be highly conserved in all pesticin-sensitive bacteria, including e. coli strains (dna sequence homology was 98.5 to 99.9%). the same degree of dna homology (97.8 to 100%) was established for the sequenced 276-bp fragment of the irp2 gene that encodes high-molecular-weight protein 2, which is  also thought to be involved in the expression of virulence by yersinia species. highly conserved irp2 was also found in all pesticin-sensitive e. coli strains. on the basis of the fyua and irp2 sequence homologies, two evolutionary groups of highly pathogenic yersinia species can be established. one group includes y. enterocolitica biotype 1b strains, while the second includes y. pestis, y. pseudotuberculosis serotype o1, and irp2-positive y. pseudotuberculosis serotype  o3 strains. e. coli phi, ca42, k49, and k235 belong to the second group. the possible proximity of these two iron-regulated genes (fyua and irp2), as well as  their high levels of sequence conservation and similar g+c contents (56.2 and 59.8 mol%), leads to the assumption that these two genes may represent part of an unstable pathogenicity island that has been acquired by pesticin-sensitive bacteria as a result of a horizontal transfer.

TI  == the rpos gene from yersinia enterocolitica and its influence on expression of virulence factors.
AB  == the chromosome of yersinia enterocolitica encodes a heat-stable enterotoxin called yst and a surface antigen called myf, which closely resembles enterotoxin-associated fimbriae. both factors could act in conjunction to produce diarrhea. production of the enterotoxin is regulated by temperature, osmolarity,  and ph and occurs only when bacteria reach the stationary phase. myf production is regulated by temperature and ph and, as we show in this work, also occurs after the exponential growth phase. in an attempt to understand the late-phase expression of yst and myf, we cloned, sequenced, and mutagenized the gene encoding rpos, an alternative sigma factor of the rna polymerase involved in expression of stationary-phase genes in other enterobacteria. an intact rpos gene was necessary for full expression of yst in the stationary phase but not for the  expression of myf and of pyv-encoded virulence determinants.

TI  == regulation of macrophage activation and human immunodeficiency virus production by invasive salmonella strains.
AB  == salmonellae possess the ability to adhere to and invade macrophages and in so doing trigger a number of intracellular events that are associated with cellular  activation. as an initial approach to defining the mechanisms by which invasive salmonellae alter macrophage function, we have explored the impact of salmonella  infection on the production of human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) in u1 cells, a  promonocytic cell line latently infected with the virus. infection of u1 cells with a pathogenic strain of salmonella enteritidis resulted in a marked induction of macrophage activation and hiv production. the stimulatory effect of salmonellae was mediated by signals other than lipopolysaccharide. salmonella mutants with specific defects in invasion or intracellular survival were markedly less effective in the induction of hiv production. in contrast to s. enteritidis, strains of yersinia enterocolitica, legionella pneumophila, and escherichia coli  did not induce hiv production. however, all of these bacteria induced comparable  levels of gene expression mediated by the hiv long terminal repeat. the results of this study are consistent with the notion that invasive salmonellae possess the ability to activate the macrophage by at least one mechanism that is not shared with several other species of gram-negative bacteria. furthermore, the expression of this unique property is maximal with salmonella strains that are not only invasive but also capable of prolonged survival within the macrophage. our results indicate that the u1 cell line may be a very useful model system with which to examine the biochemical pathways by which internalized salmonellae modulate the activation state of the macrophage.

TI  == analysis of the pesticin receptor from yersinia pestis: role in iron-deficient growth and possible regulation by its siderophore.
AB  == we have sequenced a region from the pgm locus of yersinia pestis kim6+ that confers sensitivity to the bacteriocin pesticin to certain strains of escherichia coli and y. pestis. the y. pestis sequence is 98% identical to the pesticin receptor from yersinia enterocolitica and is homologous to other tonb-dependent outer membrane proteins. y. pestis strains with an in-frame deletion in the pesticin receptor gene (psn) were pesticin resistant and no longer expressed a group of iron-regulated outer membrane proteins, irpb to irpd. in addition, this  strain as well as a y. pestis strain with a mutation constructed in the gene (irp2) encoding the 190-kda iron-regulated protein hmwp2 could not grow at 37 degrees c in a defined, iron-deficient medium. however, the irp2 mutant but not the psn mutant could be cross-fed by supernatants from various yersinia cultures  grown under iron-deficient conditions. an analysis of the proteins synthesized by the irp2 mutant suggests that hmwp2 may be indirectly required for maximal expression of the pesticin receptor. hmwp2 likely participates in synthesis of a  siderophore which may induce expression of the receptor for pesticin and the siderophore.

TI  == yersinia spp. hmwp2, a cytosolic protein with a cryptic internal signal sequence  which can promote alkaline phosphatase export.
AB  == the iron starvation-induced, 2,042-amino-acid protein hmwp2 of yersinia enterocolitica has two internal hydrophobic segments which might promote its export and association with the cytoplasmic membrane. to determine whether part of hmwp2 could be exported beyond the periplasmic face of the cytoplasmic membrane, we used tnphoa mutagenesis to construct 10 hybrid proteins in which periplasmic alkaline phosphatase (phoa) was fused to the end of c-terminally truncated hmwp1 (at amino acid positions 1751 and 1753 two independent isolates]) had high alkaline phosphate activity (close to that of the native enzyme), both in escherichia coli and in y. pseudotuberculosis, indicating that the phoa segment of the hybrid reached the periplasm. deletion studies showed that the export signal resides in the second hydrophobic segment of hmwp2. this result would be compatible with the topology of the protein in the cytoplasmic membrane  predicted from the distribution of charged amino acids at either end of the two hydrophobic segments. however, two hybrids in which the junction was even further toward the c terminus of hmmwp2 (at positions 1793 and 1999) had only weak alkaline phosphatase activity, suggesting that the predicted topology is incorrect. the location of hmwp2 was therefore determined by subcellular fractionation. the results indicate that hmpw2 is mainly cytoplasmic, consistent  with its presumed role in the atp-dependent, nonribosomal synthesis of an unknown peptide. we propose that the high alkaline phosphatase activity associated with some of the hmwp-2-phoa hybrids results from the unmasking of the cryptic export  signal activity in the second hydrophobic segment of hmpw2.

TI  == characterization of a two-gene locus from bartonella bacilliformis associated with the ability to invade human erythrocytes.
AB  == bartonella bacilliformis, the agent of human oroya fever, invades erythrocytes and causes a severe hemolytic anemia. the ability of two minimally invasive strains of escherichia coli (dh5 alpha and hb101) to invade human erythrocytes was enhanced 6- to 39-fold by transformation with pial1, a plasmid containing a 1,469-bp bamhi fragment from the b. bacilliformis chromosome. invasiveness was confirmed by gentamicin protection and transmission electron microscopy. dna hybridization analysis confirmed the presence of the locus in b. bacilliformis kc583 and kc584 and its absence in e. coli chromosomal dna. sequencing of the dna insert of pial1 revealed tandem open reading frames of 510 and 558 bp, designated iala and ialb, respectively. invasion assays with e. coli containing only an iala or ialb recombinant suggest that both genes are necessary for invasiveness. the iala gene is predicted to code for a polypeptide of 170 amino acids (20.1 kda), and ialb is predicted to code for a polypeptide of 186 amino acids (19.9 kda). in vitro transcription and translation of pial1 produced insert-specific protein bands with masses of approximately 21 and 20 kda when analyzed by sodium dodecyl  sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. expression of iala and ialb in e. coli maxicells produced proteins with masses of approximately 21 kda (iala) and 18 kda (ialb). maxicell and computer analyses suggest that ialb contains an n-terminal secretory signal sequence which is posttranslationally cleaved. searches of various dna and protein databases revealed that iala contains an n-terminal region of 35 amino acids with a high degree of homology to an ntpase consensus domain. there is 63.6% sequence conservation between the ialb protein and the invasion-associated protein ail of yersinia enterocolitica.

TI  == cloning, sequencing, and characterization of the gene encoding frpb, a major iron-regulated, outer membrane protein of neisseria gonorrhoeae.
AB  == frpb (for fe-regulated protein b) is a 76-kda outer membrane protein that is part of the iron regulon of neisseria gonorrhoeae and neisseria meningitidis. the frpb gene from gonococcal strain fa19 was cloned and sequenced. frpb was homologous to several tonb-dependent outer membrane receptors of escherichia coli as well as hemr of yersinia enterocolitica and copb of moraxella catarrhalis. an omga insertion into the frpb coding sequence caused a 60% reduction in 55fe uptake from heme, but careful analysis suggested that this effect was nonspecific. while frpb was related to the family of tonb-dependent proteins, a function in iron uptake could not be documented.

TI  == identification and characterization of an outer membrane protein, ompx, in escherichia coli that is homologous to a family of outer membrane proteins including ail of yersinia enterocolitica.

TI  == myff, an element of the network regulating the synthesis of fibrillae in yersinia enterocolitica.
AB  == the yersinia enterocolitica surface antigen myf is a fibrillar structure that resembles cs3 fimbriae. gene myfa encodes the 21-kda major subunit of the antigen, while genes myfb and myfc are required for the transport and assembly of pilin subunits at the bacterial cell surface. here we show that the expression of myf is regulated at the transcriptional level by temperature and ph. gene myfa is transcribed at 37 degrees c and in acidic medium. the transcription start is preceded by a putative -10 box for the vegetative rna polymerase as well as by sequences resembling the consensus sequence recognized by sigma 28. thus, myfa could be transcribed either from a classical sigma 70 promoter or from a sigma 28 promoter. transcription of myfa requires at least two genes, myff and myfe, situated immediately upstream from myfa. the myff product does not show similarity to any known regulatory protein. it is an 18.5-kda protein with no typical helix-turn-helix motif and a unique hydrophobic domain in the nh2-terminal part. t7 expression, osmotic shock, fractionation experiments, and tnphoa fusion analyses carried out in escherichia coli suggest that myff is associated with the inner membrane by means of its hydrophobic domain whereas the hydrophilic part protrudes in the periplasm. these features strikingly evoke toxs, a protein involved in regulation of tcp pilus production in vibrio cholerae. myfe resembles psae, a protein involved in regulation of ph6 antigen in yersinia pestis. genes myff and myfe are presumably part of a whole regulatory network. myff could be an element of the signal transducing system.

TI  == a distinct array of proinflammatory cytokines is expressed in human colon epithelial cells in response to bacterial invasion.
AB  == pathogenic bacteria that penetrate the intestinal epithelial barrier stimulate an inflammatory response in the adjacent intestinal mucosa. the present studies asked whether colon epithelial cells can provide signals that are important for the initiation and amplification of an acute mucosal inflammatory response. infection of monolayers of human colon epithelial cell lines (t84, ht29, caco-2)  with invasive strains of bacteria (salmonella dublin, shigella dysenteriae, yersinia enterocolitica, listeria monocytogenes, enteroinvasive escherichia coli) resulted in the coordinate expression and upregulation of a specific array of four proinflammatory cytokines, il-8, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, gm-csf, and tnf alpha, as assessed by mrna levels and cytokine secretion. expression of the same cytokines was upregulated after tnf alpha or il-1 stimulation of these cells. in contrast, cytokine gene expression was not altered after infection of colon epithelial cells with noninvasive bacteria or the noninvasive protozoan parasite, g. lamblia. notably, none of the cell lines expressed mrna for il-2, il-4, il-5, il-6, il-12p40, ifn-gamma, or significant levels of il-1 or il-10 in  response to the identical stimuli. the coordinate expression of il-8, mcp-1, gm-csf and tnf alpha appears to be a general property of human colon epithelial cells since an identical array of cytokines, as well as il-6, also was expressed  by freshly isolated human colon epithelial cells. since the cytokines expressed in response to bacterial invasion or other proinflammatory agonists have a well documented role in chemotaxis and activation of inflammatory cells, colon epithelial cells appear to be programmed to provide a set of signals for the activation of the mucosal inflammatory response in the earliest phases after microbial invasion.

AB  == the hrpx gene is essential for pathogenicity of xanthomonas species. loss of hrpx by mutation results in the loss of pathogenicity and a gain in the ability of xanthomonas to cause the hypersensitive response in their respective host plants, suggesting that hrpx confers a means to evade this host defense response. the function of hrpx protein was predicted by sequencing of hrpxc and hrpxo from x. campestris pv. campestris and x. oryzae, respectively. the predicted amino acid sequences of the protein encoded by these respective genes revealed similarities  (45.96%) to the hrpb protein of burkholderia solanacearum, which has sequence identity to the transcriptional activator virf of yersinia enterocolitica and arac of escherichia coli. thus, hrpx may regulate xanthomonas virulence genes since a putative dna binding domain present in the carboxyl terminal half of hrpx is highly conserved among hrpb, virf and arac and since over-expression of the carboxyl terminal half of hrpx in e. coli is lethal.

TI  == the evolutionarily conserved ribosomal protein l23 and the cationic urease beta-subunit of yersinia enterocolitica o:3 belong to the immunodominant antigens in yersinia-triggered reactive arthritis: implications for autoimmunity.
AB  == background: reactive arthritis (rea) is a t cell mediated inflammatory process. the immune response is primarily directed against a triggering organism, although autoimmunity has been invoked in long-lasting, antibiotic-resistant disease. although a variety of different species are known to trigger reactive arthritis,  the clinical manifestations are strikingly similar as well as closely associated  to the hla-b27 (70%). materials and methods: various antigenic fractions and single antigens of yersinia enterocolitica were prepared, and their immunological activity was assessed by proliferation of synovial fluid mononuclear cells from 10 reactive arthritis patients. the gene encoding one hitherto unknown antigen has been sequenced. nonapeptides deduced from sequences of the target antigens were tested in an assembly assay. results: two immunodominant proteins of yersinia enterocolitica were found, one being the urease beta-subunit and the other the 50 s ribosomal protein l23. the latter has been sequenced and belongs to the evolutionarily conserved ribosomal proteins with homology to procaryotes and eucaryotes. one nonapeptide derived from the urease beta-subunit was identified as a possible epitope for hla-b27-restricted cytotoxic t cells by its  high affinity. this epitope is also highly conserved. conclusion: sharing of conserved immunodominant proteins between different disease triggering microorganisms could provide an explanation of the shared clinical picture in reactive arthritis. moreover, autoimmunity in reactive arthritis might be mediated by antigen mimicry between evolutionarily conserved epitopes of ribosomal proteins and their host analogs.

TI  == individual chaperones required for yop secretion by yersinia.
AB  == pathogenic yersiniae secrete anti-host proteins called yops, by a recently discovered sec-independent pathway. the yops do not have a classical signal peptide at their n terminus and they are not processed during membrane translocation. the secretion domain is nevertheless contained in their n-terminal part but these domains do not resemble each other in the different yops. we have  previously shown that yope secretion requires syce, a 15-kda acidic protein acting as a specific cytosolic chaperone. here we show that the gene downstream from yoph encodes a 16-kda acidic protein that binds to hybrid proteins made of the n-terminal part of yoph and either the bacterial alkaline phosphatase or the  cholera toxin b subunit. loss of this protein by mutagenesis led to accumulation  of yoph in the cytoplasm and to a severe and selective reduction of yoph secretion. this protein thus behaves like the counterpart of syce and we called it sych. we also engineered a mutation in lcrh, the gene upstream from yopb and yopd, known to encode a 19-kda acidic protein. although this mutation was nonpolar, the mutant no longer secreted yopb and yopd. the product of lcrh could  be immunoprecipitated together with cytoplasmic yopd. lcrh therefore seems to encode a yopd-specific chaperone, which we called sycd. determination of the dependence of yopb on sycd requires further investigation. syce, sych, and sycd appear to be members of a new family of cytosolic chaperones required for yop secretion.

AB  == in natural environments such as anaerobic digesters, bacteria are frequently subjected to the stress of nutrient fluxes because of the continual changes in the flow of nutrients, and to survive, they must be capable of adapting readily to nutrient changes. in this study, the metabolic activities of escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, yersinia enterocolitica, listeria monocytogenes, and campylobacter jejuni were studied within culture bags (versapor-200 filters, 0.22-microns pore size) in laboratory anaerobic digesters. the metabolic activity of these bacteria was indicated by their adenylate energy charge (ec) ratios and  their ability to incorporate [3h]thymidine, which was related to the respective changes in viable numbers within the culture bags during anaerobic digestion. fluctuations in the adenylate ec ratios, the uptake of [3h]thymidine, and the viable numbers of e. coli, s. typhimurium, y. enterocolitica, and l. monocytogenes cells were probably due to constant changes in the amount of available nutrients within the anaerobic digesters. the viability of s. typhimurium increased quickly after a fresh supply of nutrients was added to the  system as indicated by the uptake of [3h]thymidine and an increase in the adenylate ec ratios. the viable numbers of e. coli, s. typhimurium, y. enterocolitica, and l. monocytogenes organisms declined rapidly from 10(7) to 10(8) cfu/ml to 10(3) to 10(4) cfu/ml and remained at this level for an indefinite period. the decimal reduction time calculated during the period of exponential decline ranged from 0.8 to 1.2 days for these bacteria. c. jejuni had the greatest mean decimal reduction time value (3.6 days).(abstract truncated at  250 words)

TI  == passive immunity to yersiniae mediated by anti-recombinant v antigen and protein  a-v antigen fusion peptide.
AB  == lcrv (v antigen), a known unstable 37.3-kda monomeric peptide encoded on the ca.  70-kb lcr plasmid of yersinia pestis, yersinia pseudotuberculosis, and yersinia enterocolitica, has been implicated as a regulator of the low-calcium response, virulence factor, and protective antigen. in this study, lcrv of y. pestis was cloned into protease-deficient escherichia coli bl21. the resulting recombinant v antigen underwent marked degradation from the c-terminal end during purification, yielding major peptides of 36, 35, 34, and 32 to 29 kda. rabbit gamma globulin raised against this mixture of cleavage products provided significant protection  against 10 minimum lethal doses of y. pestis (p < 0.01) and y. pseudotuberculosis (p < 0.02). to both stabilize v antigen and facilitate its purification, plasmid  ppav13 was constructed so as to encode a fusion of lcrv and the structural gene for protein a (i.e., all but the first 67 n-terminal amino acids of v antigen plus the signal sequence and immunoglobulin g-binding domains but not the cell wall-associated region of protein a). the resulting fusion peptide, termed pav, could be purified to homogeneity in one step by immunoglobulin g affinity chromatography and was stable thereafter. rabbit polyclonal gamma globulin directed against pav provided excellent passive immunity against 10 minimum lethal doses of y. pestis (p < 0.005) and y. pseudotuberculosis (p < 0.005) but was ineffective against y. enterocolitica. protection failed after absorption with excess pav, cloned whole v antigen, or a large (31.5-kda) truncated derivative of the latter but was retained (p < 0.005) upon similar absorption with a smaller (19.3-kda) truncated variant, indicating that at least one protective epitope resides internally between amino acids 168 and 275.

TI  == survival, physiological response and recovery of enteric bacteria exposed to a polar marine environment.
AB  == survival, sublethal injury, and recoverability of escherichia coli, enterococcus  faecalis, salmonella typhimurium, and yersinia enterocolitica were investigated by using diffusion chambers over 54 to 56 days of in situ exposure to a polar marine environment (-1.8 degrees c; salinity, 34.5 ppt) at mcmurdo station, antarctica. plate counts were used to assess recoverability and injury, whereas direct viable counts (dvcs) and 5-cyano-2,3-ditolyl tetrazolium chloride (ctc) reduction were utilized to determine substrate responsiveness and respiratory activity, respectively. t90 values (times for 10-fold decreases in numbers of recoverable cells) on nonselective medium were ca. 216 to 259 h for e. coli, s. typhimurium, and y. enterocolitica and 432 h for e. faecalis. sublethal injury was greater in populations of indicator bacteria than in pathogens. dvcs, ctc reduction, and plate counts indicated progressive increases in viable but nonculturable cells in e. coli, s. typhimurium, and y. enterocolitica cultures throughout the 54-day exposure. forty-eight-day exposure of e. coli, s. typhimurium, and y. enterocolitica resulted in decreased optimal incubation temperatures for colony formation and inability to form colonies at 37 degrees c. the detection of responsive e. coli, s. typhimurium, and y. enterocolitica by the dvc and ctc methods remained within 1% of inoculum values during 54 days of exposure, indicating some long-term persistence in the viable-but-nonculturable state. percentages of respiring e. coli and s. typhimurium increased significantly upon addition of nutrients at all temperatures tested, indicating that nutrient availability rather than temperature limited enteric bacterial activity in this very cold environment. large nutrient inputs to low-temperature  marine environments may thus allow for the long-term persistence of enteric bacteria in a nonrecoverable state.

TI  == transport of haemin across the cytoplasmic membrane through a haemin-specific periplasmic binding-protein-dependent transport system in yersinia enterocolitica.
AB  == the yersinia enterocolitica o:8 periplasmic binding-protein-dependent transport (pbt) system for haemin was cloned and characterized. it consisted of four proteins: the periplasmic haemin-binding protein hemt, the haemin permease protein hemu, the atp-binding hydrophilic protein hemv and the putative haemin-degrading protein hems. y. enterocolitica strains mutated in hemu or hemv  genes were unable to use haemin as an iron source whereas those mutated in the hemt gene were able to use haemin as an iron source. as escherichia coli strains  expressing only the haemin outer membrane receptor protein hemr from y. enterocolitica were capable of using haemin as an iron source the existence of an e. coli k-12 haemin-specific pbt system is postulated. the first gene in the y. enterocolitica haemin-specific pbt system encoded a protein, hems, which is probably involved in the degradation of haemin in the cytoplasm. the presence of  the hems gene was necessary to prevent haemin toxicity in e. coli strains that accumulate large amounts of haemin in the cytoplasm. we propose a model of haemin utilization in y. enterocolitica in which hemt, hemu and hemv proteins transport  haemin into the cytoplasm where it is degraded by hems thereby liberating the iron.

TI  == characterisation of the urease-encoding gene complex of yersinia enterocolitica.
AB  == a cosmid gene library of chromosomal dna from yersinia enterocolitica a2635 (serogroup o:8) was constructed in escherichia coli. subcloning of a urease-positive (ure+) clone revealed a region of 6.6 kb that was sufficient for  expression of ure activity in e. coli. sequencing of this fragment disclosed seven orfs transcribed in the same direction. on the basis of homology to known ure, these were designated urea, ureb, urec, uree, uref, ureg and ured, which are predicted to encode polypeptides of 11.1, 17.9, 61.0, 29.5, 25.0, 24.1 and 36.4 kda, respectively. the polypeptides encoded by the ure gene complex of y. enterocolitica are significantly divergent from those encoded by the ure operons  of other enterobacteriaceae, which appear to be closely related to each other. this suggests that the ure genes were acquired by y. enterocolitica from an unrelated organism or alternatively, that they diverged from those of other enterobacteriaceae some considerable time ago.

TI  == me1 epitope of hla-b27 confers class i-mediated modulation of gram-negative bacterial invasion.
AB  == we have previously demonstrated that the presence of the mhc class i molecule, hla-b27, on the surface of transfected fibroblasts differentially alters gram-negative bacterial invasion as compared with class i alleles that are not implicated in the seronegative spondyloarthropathies. we have now extended this analysis to show that fibroblasts transfected with hla-b7, a cross-reactive allele with hla-b27, also demonstrate a similar altered bacterial invasion phenotype. the decrease in the ability of the bacteria to penetrate the hla-b27 and hla-b7 transfectants is an invasion-mediated event, as demonstrated by differential invasion events using escherichia coli transfected with the inv gene of yersinia enterocolitica. the lysine at position 70, although unique to the hla-b27 subtypes, is shown to be not involved in mediating the decrease in invasion. however, the me1 epitope is the critical factor in determining allele-specific alteration in invasion on the basis of the following: 1) me1 mab  preincubation reverses the decrease; 2) me1-binding alleles act like hla-b27; 3)  a class i allele that is intermediate in me1 binding (hla-b14) also demonstrates  a relative decrease in invasion; and 4) mutation at residue 67 (c-->y) in hla-b27, which eliminates the me1 epitope, normalizes the decreased invasion seen in the native hla-b27-transfected cells. thus, the me1 epitope relates to the disease susceptibility for reactive arthritis that is conferred by both hla-b27 and cross-reactive group ags.

TI  == protective role for heat shock protein-reactive alpha beta t cells in murine yersiniosis.
AB  == to investigate the role of heat shock proteins (hsp) of yersinia enterocolitica for the host immune response against this pathogen, we cloned and expressed a 60-kda hsp of y. enterocolitica serotype o8. a fragment of y. enterocolitica o8 hsp60 encoded by amino acids 90 to 286 was sequenced and showed more than 90% homology with hsp60 of y. enterocolitica o3 and groel of escherichia coli and 59% homology with hsp65 of mycobacterium bovis. the arthritogenic t-cell epitope of mycobacterial hsp65 (amino acid residues 180 to 188) was not found on yersinia hsp60. to determine whether yersinia hsp60 is an immunodominant antigen, the immune responses of yersinia-infected c57bl/6 mice were analyzed. yersinia-infected mice evolved a significant serum antibody and splenic t-cell response against yersinia hsp60. cd4+ alpha beta t-cell clones which were generated from splenic t cells isolated from either yersinia-infected or yersinia hsp60-immunized mice, recognized both heat-killed yersinia serotypes o3 and o8 as well as recombinant yersinia hsp60 but not heat-killed yersinia pseudotuberculosis, salmonella typhimurium, or recombinant hsp65 of mycobacterium bovis. the adoptive transfer of hsp60-reactive t-cell clones mediated significant protection against a lethal infection with y. enterocolitica o8. these results indicate that hsp60 of y. enterocolitica is an immunodominant antigen which is recognized by both antibodies and cd4+ alpha beta t cells. moreover, this is the  first report providing direct evidence that microbial hsp may elicit a protective immune response which is not associated with autoimmunity.

AB  == a longitudinal study of diarrheal disease among patients of all ages with acute diarrhea was carried out in new caledonia from january 1990 to december 1991. stool samples from 2,088 diarrheal patients were examined for parasites, rotavirus, and bacterial pathogens. potential sources of contamination (drinking  water, seawater and bovine and porcine feces) were investigated. one or more enteric pathogens were identified in 41.8 and 40.6% of the persons with diarrhea, in 1990 and 1991, respectively. salmonella spp., shigella spp., hep-2 cell adherent escherichia coli (diffuse adherent and enteroaggregative), enteropathogenic e. coli (epec) (epec adherence factor-positive strains belonging to classical serotypes), localized adherent e. coli (non-epec), and enterotoxigenic e. coli were the frequently identified enteropathogenic bacteria. other major enteropathogens were entamoeba histolytica and giardia lamblia. campylobacter jejuni, clostridium difficile, clostridium perfringens, yersinia enterocolitica, and rotavirus were isolated from only a few patients. no vibrio spp., aeromonas spp., plesiomonas spp., shiga-like-toxin-producing e. coli, enterohemorrhagic e. coli, or enteroinvasive e. coli were identified. shiga-like  toxin i-producing e. coli were present in adult bovines and calves, and heat-stable enterotoxin ii-producing enterotoxigenic e. coli were found in pigs.

TI  == differential regulation of stem cell factor mrna expression in human endothelial  cells by bacterial pathogens: an in vitro model of inflammation.
AB  == production of hematopoietic growth factors by endothelial cells plays a pivotal role during inflammatory processes. stem cell factor (scf) is known to be expressed constitutively in endothelial cells. to investigate the regulation of this cytokine expression by inflammatory stimuli, we cocultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (huvec) with various gram-negative bacterial strains (escherichia coli, yersinia enterocolitica, chlamydia trachomatis, and neisseria  meningitidis, respectively). experiments were performed with bacterial concentrations ranging from 10(2) to 10(7) bacteria/ml for 3 hours. scf-specific  mrna expression was studied using northern blot analysis. stimulation with the enteropathogenic bacterial strains y enterocolitica and e coli resulted in a significant concentration-dependent increase of scf mrna expression. similar results were obtained in coculture experiments with n meningitidis. as shown in experiments with e coli, the accumulation of scf transcripts was also time-dependent. in contrast, coculture of huvec with the intracellular gram-negative strain c trachomatis had no effect on scf mrna expression. to elucidate the role of the gram-negative bacterial cell wall components, we stimulated huvec with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (lps). lps induced a maximal scf mrna accumulation within 2 hours followed by decrease of scf-specific transcripts to the basal level after 24 hours. in addition, we exposed huvec to the classical inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1 alpha (il-1 alpha). kinetic experiments showed a similar pattern of regulation with an increase of scf mrna within 2 hours, persisting up to 12 hours, and a decrease to basal transcription  after 24 hours. from these data, we conclude that scf expression is regulated by  inflammatory stimuli, such as il-1 alpha and bacterial pathogens, suggesting an important role of scf during inflammation.

TI  == yada mediates specific binding of enteropathogenic yersinia enterocolitica to human intestinal submucosa.
AB  == the binding of live yersinia enterocolitica to frozen sections of human intestine was investigated qualitatively by monitoring the binding of bacteria by using gram or immunoperoxidase staining as well as quantitatively by a new enzyme immunoassay-on-slide method. we have demonstrated that the binding of various y.  enterocolitica serotypes and escherichia coli clones to frozen sections of human  intestine is mediated by the yersinia adhesin, yada. the yada-mediated binding occurs mainly at the submucosal layer of the intestinal wall and only to a limited extent at the mucosal layer; there binding is mostly to the mucin threads. in addition, partially purified yada binds to frozen sections with a pattern similar to that of intact bacteria. collagen, laminin, or partially purified yada only partially inhibited the yada-mediated binding of bacteria, presumably because yada is multifunctional. a combination of collagen and laminin inhibited the binding more efficiently. therefore, yada may be involved in the interactions with the extracellular matrix molecules after the invasion of the intestinal tissue.

TI  == listeria monocytogenes, an invasive bacterium, stimulates map kinase upon attachment to epithelial cells.
AB  == protein tyrosine phosphorylation is an important regulatory mechanism for many cellular processes in eucaryotic cells. during the invasion of the gram-positive  pathogen, listeria monocytogenes, into host epithelial cells, two host proteins become tyrosine phosphorylated. we have identified these major tyrosine phosphorylated species to be two isoforms of mitogen-activated protein (map) kinase, the 42 and 44 kda map kinases. this activation begins within 5 to 15 min  of bacterial infection. the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, genistein, blocks invasion as well as the tyrosine phosphorylation of these map kinases. using cytochalasin  d to block bacterial internalization but not adhesion, we showed that bacterial adherence rather than uptake is required for map kinase activation. internalin mutants, which are unable to adhere efficiently to host cells, do not trigger map kinase activation. other invasive bacteria, including enteropathogenic escherichia coli (epec), and e. coli expressing yersinia enterocolitica invasion, were not observed to activate map kinase during invasion into cultured epithelial cells. these results suggest that l. monocytogenes activates map kinase during invasion and a map kinase signal transduction pathway may be involved in mediating bacterial uptake.

TI  == alkali-treated lps of yersinia enterocolitica does not induce expression of e-selectin, icam-1 or vcam-1 on endothelial cells but may mediate antibody- and complement-dependent cell injury.
AB  == lipopolysaccharide (lps) prepared from a rough mutant of salmonella typhimurium and deacylated enzymatically (dlps) does not promote neutrophil adherence to human umbilical vein endothelial cells (huvecs). this paper reports that similarly, a smooth form of lps prepared from yersinia enterocolitica o:3, a serotype known to trigger reactive arthritis in humans, and treated with alkali (yersinia lps-oh) failed to augment neutrophil adherence to huvecs. studies of the mechanism underlying the poor augmentation revealed that neither enzymatically deacylated lps from escherichia coli j5 (j5 dlps) nor yersinia lps-oh stimulated expression of endothelial cell adhesion molecules e-selectin, vcam-1 and icam-1, whereas both intact j5 lps and yersinia lps were stimulatory.  impaired up-regulation could not be explained by decreased binding of yersinia lps-oh to huvecs. furthermore, 51cr-labelled huvecs treated with different concentrations of yersinia lps-oh released 51cr in the presence of anti-yersinia  anti-o antibody and complement. j5 dlps and yersinia lps-oh inhibited up-regulation of the adhesion molecules induced by j5 lps and yersinia lps but not that induced by tumour necrosis factor alpha. taken together, the results suggest that although yersinia lps-oh can depress development of acute inflammation by inhibiting up-regulation of endothelial-cell adhesion molecules,  sufficient lps-oh is bound to induce cell injury and thereby inflammation in the  presence of specific antibody and complement. the findings may have pathogenetic  implications in yersinia-triggered reactive arthritis characterized by dissemination of yersinia lps throughout the body.

TI  == a study of the aetiological agents of childhood diarrhoea in lagos, nigeria.
AB  == from december 1989 to may 1990, 315 faecal samples from children under 5 years old with diarrhoea (215) and without diarrhoea (100) seen at paediatric clinics were investigated for bacterial, viral and parasitic enteropathogens. standard and recently described methods were used for the investigations, which revealed that 74.9% of children with diarrhoea were infected with enteropathogens compared with 28% of controls. in the diarrhoeal group, 59.1% had a bacterial, 26.5% a viral and 2.3% a parasitic aetiology. rotavirus was the pathogen most frequently  detected, accounting for 22.3% of positive findings in the group with diarrhoea versus 9% in the control group. other important agents were: enterotoxigenic escherichia coli (etec) (14.4 versus 6%), enteropathogenic e. coli (epec) (10.7 versus 5%), enteroadherent e. coli (eaec) (9.3 versus 4%), enterohaemorrhagic e.  coli (ehec) (5.1 versus 3%) and salmonella spp. (3.3 versus 1%). the following enteropathogens were detected exclusively in the diarrhoeal stools: shigella spp. (5.1%), yersinia enterocolitica (0.9%), aeromonas hydrophila (1.4%), entamoeba histolytica (0.5%), giardia lamblia (0.5%), trichomonas hominis (0.5) and trichuris trichiura (0.9%). the detection rates of rotavirus, epec and eaec were  much greater in the diarrhoeal than in the control patients. no vibrio cholerae,  enteroinvasive e. coli (eiec), plesiomonas spp. or cryptosporidium spp. were detected in this study. our data suggest that both the traditional and newly recognised diarrhoeal agents are important causes of diarrhoea in the children under 5 years old in lagos, nigeria.

TI  == characterization of the dtdp-rhamnose biosynthetic genes encoded in the rfb locus of shigella flexneri.
AB  == the nucleotide sequence of the proximal half of the rfb region of shigella flexneri has been determined, and the genes encoding enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of dtdp-rhamnose have been identified. these genes show strong homology to the rfb genes encoding dtdp-rhamnose biosynthesis in salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium (strain lt2) and s. enterica serovar anatum (strain  m32) (jiang et al., 1991; wang et al., 1992). an open reading frame upstream of rfbb was also identified which encoded a protein having strong similarity with gaiu, and has been designated galf. galf has 92% amino acid sequence identity with an s. enterica lt2 gene, orf2x8, which is similarly situated upstream of rfbb (jiang et al., 1991). the t7 expression system was utilized to identify proteins corresponding to those predicted from dna sequence analysis. the similarity of the predicted proteins with proteins that are functionally identical or related, and with others of unknown function from the yersinia enterocolitica o3 rfb region, and in the escherichia coli k-12 rff region are also described. we have re-addressed the assignment of each gene of the dtdp-rhamnose pathway with the known enzymes of the pathway, in particular rfbc and rfbd. a reporter plasmid to detect genes encoding enzymes of the dtdp-rhamnose pathway is described. an analysis of the intergenic region between  galf and rfbb has been made, and comparison with the same region from s. enterica lt2 discussed.

TI  == a new class of proteins regulating gene expression in enterobacteria.
AB  == ymoa and hha are highly similar bacterial proteins downregulating gene expression in yersinia enterocolitica and escherichia coli, respectively. the phenotype of ymoa mutants evokes that of mutants affected in some histone-like proteins. this  paper describes complementation of a ymoa mutation in y. enterocolitica by the hha gene from e. coli. we show that ymoa and hha are not only very similar proteins but that they are functionally interchangeable. genetic experiments indicate that hha can also stimulate transposition events in vivo. by southern blot analysis we detected hha-homologous genes at least in citrobacter diversus,  shigella flexneri, shigella dysenteriae, klebsiella pneumoniae and salmonella typhimurium. we suggest that both ymoa and hha belong to a new family of proteins downregulating gene expression in different enterobacteria.

TI  == induction of yersinia enterocolitica stress proteins by phagocytosis with macrophage.
AB  == yersinia enterocolitica is a facultative intracellular pathogen which invades to  epithelial cells and survives in phagocytes. since the internal environment of phagocytes should be stressful conditions for the phagocytosed yersinia, the bacteria should respond to protect themselves from otherwise lethal results. we analyzed the stress-induced proteins which possibly contribute to survival of yersinia within the phagocytes. y. enterocolitica was radiolabeled during the growth in macrophage-like j774-1 cells, and the bacterial proteins were analyzed  by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. at least 16 proteins were selectively induced in response to phagocytosis, and several out of 16 proteins were also induced by heat shock at 42 c or oxidative stresses in vitro. of those, two major stress proteins were identified to be homologues of dnak and crpa by immunoblotting analysis. these results have indicated that y. enterocolitica exhibits a global stress response to the hostile environment in the phagocytosed  macrophage.

TI  == seroreactivity to bacterial antigens is not a unique phenomenon in patients with  autoimmune thyroid diseases in canada.
AB  == it has been suggested elsewhere that the enteric pathogen yersinia enterocolitica (y.e.) might be implicated etiologically in autoimmune thyroid disease (aitd). to reevaluate this hypothesis in the canadian population, where the prevalence of anti-y.e. antibodies in the general population is very low (< 1%), we have studied the occurrence of antibacterial reactivity (against y.e. 0:3 and 0:9, escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus) in the sera of patients with hashimoto's thyroiditis (ht), graves' disease (gd), nontoxic nodular goiter (ntg), and autoimmune rheumatic diseases (ard) as well as normal controls (c). using the tube agglutination method, no single positive sample was detected in these subjects. no differences in the mean levels of anti-y.e. 0:3 or 0:9 by elisa were observed between various groups of patients. immunoreactivity in the course of medical therapy during 5-12 months did not show significant changes in  any of 12 ard and aitd patients. some serological reactivity to the plasmid containing strain of y.e. 0:3 was demonstrated in all subjects by the western blotting technique. however, weaker signals and fewer bands were noticed in these sera compared to sera from patients with acute yersiniosis. analysis of the pattern of reactivity did not show any difference in reactivity to any protein between the groups of subjects. the immunodominant antigen in y.e. 0:3 to which igg reacted in almost all subjects was the plasmid encoded 240-kda protein. our study favors the view that there is a merely coincidental incidence of seroreactivity to bacterial antigens, which appears to be irrespective of diagnosis.

TI  == cloning and nucleotide sequence analysis of immunodominant heat-shock protein of  yersinia enterocolitica.
AB  == yersinia enterocolitica, a highly antigenic 60-kda protein, designated cross-reacting protein antigen (crpa), is a member of the chaperonin-60 family of molecular chaperones. the gene encoding crpa was cloned, expressed and sequenced. a partial library from y. enterocolitica 0:3 genomic dna was constructed in vector puc19 and was screened by the immunoreactivity to monoclonal antibody 1a4, which has specificity for a species-specific epitope on the crpa molecule. the crpa gene region consists of a putative two-cistron operon encoding proteins of 549 and 97 amino acids. the operon structure was led by a consensus heat-shock promoter sequence. homology searches using the derived amino acid sequence have revealed that crpa is 88.2% identical to groel of escherichia coli. crpb, another protein encoded by the operon, shows extensive sequence homology, 91.8% identical to groes of e. coli which is a member of chaperonin-10.

TI  == purification of yersiniabactin: a siderophore and possible virulence factor of yersinia enterocolitica.
AB  == hplc analysis revealed that yersinia enterocolitica wa-c produced two substances  under iron-limiting conditions one of which was identified as 2,3-dihydroxybenzoyl-l-serine. the other compound had iron-complexing activity and was called yersiniabactin. the fur mutant h1852 was shown to produce yersiniabactin constitutively in an iron-independent manner. yersiniabactin was isolated by ethyl acetate extraction from the spent medium of h1852, size-fractionation chromatography and preparative hplc. a catechol function was demonstrated with different chemical assays and by uv-visible spectroscopy. the molecular mass of yersiniabactin was determined to be 482 da. purified yersiniabactin stimulated growth of y. enterocolitica and escherichia coli phi under iron-limiting conditions and apparently served as an iron carrier. transport of 55fe-yersiniabactin was tonb-dependent, indicating a receptor-mediated uptake across the outer membrane. a pesticin-resistant mutant missing the receptor protein fyua was unable to transport and use yersiniabactin  as a siderophore.

TI  == study of enterobacteriaceae throughout the manufacturing and ripening of hard goats' cheese.
AB  == the evolution of the counts and the species of enterobacteriaceae as well as some physico-chemical parameters (ph, aw and nacl and moisture contents) during manufacturing and ripening of a hard spanish goats' cheese of the armada-sobado variety were studied. enterobacteriaceae (mean log counts 4.45 g-1 in milk) increased 0.71-2.18 log units in curd and afterwards decreased until they disappeared after 2-4 weeks of ripening. this premature disappearance seems to be due to the decrease in aw values and in moisture contents. however, the low ph values, reached from the beginning of the ripening process, could also contribute to this phenomenon. the most abundant species in milk was serratia liquefaciens (57.5% of isolates), followed by morganella morganii (27.5%), hafnia alvei (5%),  klebsiella oxytoca (5%) and yersinia enterocolitica (5%). yersinia enterocolitica was not subsequently isolated from either curd or in cheese. hafnia alvei numbers increased in curd and in 1-week-old cheese where this micro-organism was the most abundant (47.5% and 75% of the isolates respectively). escherichia coli, which was not isolated from milk, curd or 1-week-old cheese, was the predominant organism in 2-week-old cheese (57.8% of isolates). this confirms the finding of other authors who have shown that it is one of the most resistant species in ripening cheeses.

TI  == survival of pathogenic bacteria during mesophilic anaerobic digestion of animal waste.
AB  == the survival of pathogenic bacteria was investigated during the operation of a full-scale anaerobic digester which was fed daily and operated at 28 degrees c. the digester had a mean hydraulic retention time of 24 d. the viable numbers of escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, yersinia enterocolitica, listeria monocytogenes and campylobacter jejuni were reduced during mesophilic anaerobic digestion. escherichia coli had the smallest mean viable numbers at each stage of the digestion process. its mean t90 value was 76.9 d. yersinia enterocolitica was the least resistant to the anaerobic digester environment; its mean t90 value was 18.2 d. campylobacter jejuni was the most resistant bacterium; its mean t90 value was 438.6 d. regression analysis showed that there were no direct relationships between the slurry input and performance of the digester and the decline of pathogen numbers during the 140 d experimental period.

TI  == escherichia coli hha mutants, dna supercoiling and expression of the haemolysin genes from the recombinant plasmid pann202-312.
AB  == the hha gene of escherichia coli was identified as modulating the expression of the haemolysin (hly) genes encoded by the recombinant plasmid pann202-312. hha mutants harbouring plasmid pann202-312 showed increased haemolysin production. the product of the hha gene, the hha protein, shows strong homology to the ymoa protein of yersinia enterocolitica, which plays a role in the thermoregulation of various y. enterocolitica virulence genes. we show in this study that the hha protein modulates the expression of haemolysin at the transcriptional level in cells harbouring plasmid pann202-312. in addition, hha mutants show alterations in the level of plasmid dna supercoiling. this suggests that the hha mutation increases haemolysin expression through changes in the dna topology. this hypothesis is supported by our finding that gyr mutations, inhibitors of dna gyrase such as novobiocin, or growth in conditions reported to reduce levels of negative supercoiling, such as low osmolarity medium, increase haemolysin production.

TI  == role of the yada protein in prevention of opsonization of yersinia enterocolitica by c3b molecules.
AB  == when mixed with normal human serum, wild-type pathogenic yersinia enterocolitica, previously incubated at 37 degrees c, fixed less c3b than its variant cured of the virulence plasmid pyv. mutants unable to secrete the yop proteins were still  protected against c3b deposition. by contrast, mutants deficient in the production of outer membrane protein yada fixed more c3b than their yada+ parent. gene yada, cloned as a minimal polymerase chain reaction fragment and introduced  in trans, complemented the mutations. production of yada by recombinant escherichia coli lk111 also resulted in a reduction of the amount of c3b deposited on the bacterial surface. the reduction of c3b at the surface of y. enterocolitica yada+ compared with yada- cells correlated with an increase of the amount of factor h fixed at the bacterial surface. the yada monomer separated by  sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane was able to bind factor h. we conclude that factor h bound to yada reduces the c3b deposition on the bacterial surface, probably by a  rapid inactivation of c3b.

TI  == genetic organization and sequence of the rfb gene cluster of yersinia enterocolitica serotype o:3: similarities to the dtdp-l-rhamnose biosynthesis pathway of salmonella and to the bacterial polysaccharide transport systems.
AB  == the yersinia enterocolitica o:3 lipopolysaccharide o-antigen is a homopolymer of  6-deoxy-l-altrose. the cloned rfb region was sequenced, and 10 open reading frames were identified. transposon mutagenesis, deletion analysis and transcomplementation experiments showed that eight of the genes, organized into two operons, rfbabc and rfbdefgh, are essential for o-antigen synthesis. functional tandem promoters were identified upstream of both operons. of the deduced polypeptides rfba, rfbf and rfbg were similar to salmonella proteins involved in the dtdp-l-rhamnose biosynthesis. rhamnose and 6-deoxy-l-altrose are  c3-epimers suggesting that analogous pathways function in their biosynthesis. rfbd and rfbe were similar to capsular polysaccharide export proteins, e.g. kpsm  and kpst of escherichia coli. this and transposon mutagenesis showed that rfbd and rfbe function as o-antigen exporters.

TI  == virulence of yersinia enterocolitica is closely associated with siderophore production, expression of an iron-repressible outer membrane polypeptide of 65,000 da and pesticin sensitivity.
AB  == iron-repressible outer membrane proteins (irp) and siderophore production of yersinia enterocolitica, serotype 08, were subjected to analysis. here four irps  of apparent molecular weights of 62,000, 65,000, 74,000 and 75,000 could be identified which were expressed constitutively by a fur mutant. production of a novel catechol-containing siderophore (denoted yersiniabactin) was detected by siderophore-indicator agar (chrome azurol s) and feeding experiments. growth support by yersiniabactin under iron-restricted conditions was tonb- and irp65-dependent and correlated with pesticin-sensitivity of yersinia enterocolitica and escherichia coli o. from these results we conclude that irp65  of y. enterocolitica functions as yersiniabactin receptor (fyua) and as pesticin  receptor. by immunoblotting using rabbit antibodies against irp65 and chrome azurol s-agar, we were able to demonstrate that all tested mouse-lethal y. enterocolitica and yersinia pseudotuberculosis strains of different serotypes express siderophores and irp65. moreover, the anti-irp65 rabbit serum did not cross-react with the known iron-repressible high-molecular-weight proteins (hmwps). evidently, the mouse lethality trait in enteropathogenic yersinia spp. is closely associated with a novel iron-uptake system, comprising the production  of a siderophore and a siderophore receptor of apparent molecular mass 65,000 da.

TI  == elimination of extracellular bacteria by antibiotics in quantitative assays of bacterial ingestion and killing by phagocytes.
AB  == in vitro assays to quantify the bactericidal capacity of phagocytes require the removal of extracellular bacteria from the reaction mixture before intracellular  bacteria are released from the phagocytic cells and counted. this may be achieved by using an antibiotic, such as gentamicin, which has a rapid bactericidal action coupled with limited ability to cross cytoplasmic membranes. in this study, we investigated the susceptibility of escherichia coli and yersinia enterocolitica to killing by mouse peritoneal macrophages. extracellular bacteria in the reaction mixture were eliminated with gentamicin, whereafter the antibiotic was enzymatically inactivated using gentamicin acetyl transferase (gat). the method has few washing stages, thus reducing the likelihood of inadvertent removal of macrophages or bacteria from the reaction mixture. the assay disclosed clear differences in the ability of e. coli and y. enterocolitica to survive phagocytosis by macrophages.

TI  == the tonb-dependent ferrichrome receptor fcua of yersinia enterocolitica: evidence against a strict co-evolution of receptor structure and substrate specificity.
AB  == a yersinia enterocolitica receptor mutant was isolated which is impaired in ferrichrome uptake. the receptor-encoding gene fcua was cloned in escherichia coli k-12. a fcua mutant of y. enterocolitica could be complemented by the cloned dna fragment. the fcua-encoding region was sequenced and an open reading frame encoding 758 amino acids including a signal sequence of 36 amino acids was found. fcua shared 34.6% amino acid sequence homology with fata, the anguibactin receptor of vibrio anguillarum, but only 20.6% homology with fhua, the ferrichrome receptor of e. coli. since the structure of anguibactin differs strongly from that of ferrichrome there seems to be no co-evolution of receptor structure and substrate specificity. the ferrichrome receptors fcua from y. enterocolitica and fhua from e. coli had slightly different substrate specificities. in contrast to fhua from e. coli, fcua from y. enterocolitica was  more stereoselective and failed to transport enantio ferrichrome. three additional ferrichrome receptors were cloned from pantoea agglomerans (formerly erwinia herbicola), salmonella paratyphi b and salmonella typhimurium. their substrate specificity was similar but not identical.

AB  == the tonb gene is required for energy-dependent transport processes across the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria. using the antibiotics albomycin and ferrimycin, a tonb mutant of yersinia enterocolitica was isolated. comparison of  the tonb mutant with the parent strain revealed that in y. enterocolitica the uptake of ferrioxamine, ferrichrome, pesticin and heme is tonb-dependent. the tonb gene from y. enterocolitica was sequenced and found to be similar to those of other enterobacteria. the y. enterocolitica tonb gene complemented a y. enterocolitica tonb mutant. in contrast, some tonb functions of an escherichia coli tonb mutant were not restored by the tonb gene of y. enterocolitica. the observed differences in the ability to complement e. coli tonb functions correlated with the degree to which the tonb boxes of the receptors and colicins  differed from the tonb box consensus sequence. furthermore, the n-terminal membrane anchor of the tonb proteins and the tola protein are likely to form an alpha-helix with an identical sequence motif (shls) located at one face of the alpha-helix, suggesting this region to be involved in the functional cross-talk between the tonb-exbbd- and tolabqr-dependent transport systems across the outer  membrane.

AB  == an agar dilution technique was used to compare the antimicrobial activities of lomefloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and enoxacin against 544 strains of bacterial isolates. among the five quinolone agents tested, ciprofloxacin was the most active. enoxacin was the most active after ciprofloxacin against escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, proteus mirabilis, shigella spp., yersinia enterocolitica, and haemophilus influenzae with an mic90 of < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml. ofloxacin was the most active agent after ciprofloxacin against klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter diversus, and legionella pneumophila with an mic of < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml. ciprofloxacin inhibited staphylococcus spp. and streptococcus spp., at < or = 0.5 micrograms/ml and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. norfloxacin  and enoxacin had the same antimicrobial activity (mic90) against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae and some other gram-positive species, but these activities were weak when compared with ciprofloxacin. the results of this in vitro study show that ciprofloxacin is very active against gram-negative and gram-positive species.

TI  == the gene encoding the heat-stable enterotoxin of vibrio cholerae is flanked by 123-base pair direct repeats.
AB  == the heat-stable enterotoxin (o1-st) gene (sto) was cloned from chromosome of the  strain gp156 of vibrio cholerae o1 (inaba, el tor) in escherichia coli k-12, and  its nucleotide sequence was determined. the nucleotide sequence of sto was very similar to that of nag-st gene (stn) of v. cholerae non-o1. both sto and stn were flanked by 123-base pair direct repeats which had at least 93% homology to one another and included some inverted repeats. all the strains of v. cholerae, v. mimicus, v. metschnikovii, v. hollisae and yersinia enterocolitica examined by colony hybridization had the direct repeat sequence regardless of st-gene possession.

TI  == immunological methods for the detection of structural components and metabolites  of bacteria and fungi in blood.
AB  == this review compares the clinical usefulness of immunological methods for the detection of structural components and metabolites of bacteria and fungi. bacterial antigens (especially those of mycobacterium, neisseria, staphylococcus  aureus, yersinia enterocolitica, escherichia coli, salmonella, chlamydia, and brucella) are best detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. methods involving antibodies are more expensive and are effective only when performed in  series. the detection of antibodies that recognize s aureus teichoic acid merely  confirms the presence of a metastatic complication. tissue invasion by candida albicans is not yet reliably detectable by the presence of a specific antigen. simple, but not completely reliable methods are available such as the latex test  for mannans detection and/or agglutination with liposomes for detecting 48-kda cytoplasmic protein antigen and an assay for detecting enolase antigen. a latex agglutination test has also been developed for the mannans antigen of aspergillus and for cryptococcus neoformans capsular polysaccharide; the latter test is more  cost effective. the sensitivity of both tests is improved by serial assays. a negative finding with hemagglutination-based antibody tests rules out c albicans  infection, and titers of 1/640 or higher have been associated with disseminated infection by aspergillus. concentrations of c albicans blastopore antigen antibodies higher than 400 iu/ml can be seen in disseminated candidiasis. high concentrations of endotoxin are indicative of imminent septic shock. some biological indicators (c reactive protein, angiotensin converting enzyme, fibronectin, elastase-alpha 1-antitrypsin complex, tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-6) have been used to rule out a bacterial cause of fever.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == antibacterial spectrum of lactoferricin b, a potent bactericidal peptide derived  from the n-terminal region of bovine lactoferrin.
AB  == a physiologically diverse range of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria was found to be susceptible to inhibition and inactivation by lactoferricin b, a peptide produced by gastric pepsin digestion of bovine lactoferrin. the list of susceptible organisms includes escherichia coli, salmonella enteritidis, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, yersinia enterocolitica, pseudomonas aeruginosa, campylobacter jejuni, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus mutans, corynebacterium diphtheriae, listeria monocytogenes and clostridium perfringens.  concentrations of lactoferricin b required to cause complete inhibition of growth varied within the range of 0.3 to 150 micrograms/ml, depending on the strain and  the culture medium used. the peptide showed activity against e. coli o111 over the range of ph 5.5 to 7.5 and was most effective under slightly alkaline conditions. its antibacterial effectiveness was reduced in the presence of na+, k+, mg2+ or ca2+ ions, or in the presence of various buffer salts. lactoferricin  b was lethal, causing a rapid loss of colony-forming capability in most of the species tested. pseudomonas fluorescens, enterococcus faecalis and bifidobacterium bifidum strains were highly resistant to this peptide.

TI  == degenerate pcr primers for the amplification of fragments from genes encoding response regulators from a range of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == many bacterial responses to environmental stimuli are mediated by response regulators which coordinately regulate genes involved in particular adaptive responses. degenerate oligonucleotide primers were used to amplify by the polymerase chain reaction (pcr), fragments from genes encoding eleven novel response regulators. sequence and phylogenetic analysis revealed that phob, phop  and creb gene fragments had been amplified from yersinia enterocolitica and yersinia pseudotuberculosis, and that a creb sequence had been amplified from campylobacter jejuni. four amplified fragments from c. jejuni, listeria monocytogenes, mycobacterium tuberculosis and escherichia coli clearly came from  response regulator genes, but were not closely related to any of the known genes. mutagenesis of the newly identified genes should allow us to determine their function and the genes under their control.

TI  == hemin uptake system of yersinia enterocolitica: similarities with other tonb-dependent systems in gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == the hemin receptor hemr of yersinia enterocolitica was identified as a 78 kda iron regulated outer membrane protein. cells devoid of the hemr receptor as well  as cells mutated in the tonb gene were unable to take up hemin as an iron source. the hemin uptake operon from y. enterocolitica was cloned in escherichia coli k12 and was shown to encode four proteins: hemp (6.5 kda), hemr (78 kda), hems (42 kda) and hemt (27 kda). when expressed in e.coli hema arob, a plasmid carrying genes for hemp and hemr allowed growth on hemin as a porphyrin source. presence of genes for hemp, hemr and hems was necessary to allow e.coli hema arob cells to use hemin as an iron source. the nucleotide sequence of the hemr gene and its promoter region was determined and the amino acid sequence of the hemr receptor deduced. hemr has a signal peptide of 28 amino acids and a typical tonb box at its amino-terminus. upstream of the first gene in the operon (hemp), a well conserved fur box was found which is in accordance with the iron-regulated expression of hemr.

TI  == mxij, a lipoprotein involved in secretion of shigella ipa invasins, is homologous to yscj, a secretion factor of the yersinia yop proteins.
AB  == shigella flexneri causes bacillary dysentery by invading epithelial cells of the  colonic mucosa. the invasion process requires the synthesis and secretion of the  virulence plasmid-encoded ipa proteins. using tnphoa mutagenesis, we have identified two virulence plasmid genes, mxij and mxim, that encode proteins exported by the general export pathway. analysis of the mxij and mxim deduced amino acid sequences suggested that mxij and mxim might encode lipoproteins, which was confirmed by [3h]palmitate labeling of mxij:phoa and mxim:phoa fusion proteins. a mxij mutant was unable to invade hela cells, to induce the formation  of plaques on confluent monolayers of hela cells, and to provoke keratoconjunctivitis in guinea pigs. in addition, secretion of seven polypeptides, including ipaa, ipab, and ipac, was abolished in the mxij mutant. sequence comparisons indicated that mxij and mxih, which is encoded by a gene located upstream from mxij, are homologous to the yersinia enterocolitica yscj and yscf proteins, respectively.

TI  == the pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae 61 hrph product, an envelope protein required for elicitation of the hypersensitive response in plants.
AB  == pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae 61 contains a 25-kb cluster of hrp genes that are required for elicitation of the hypersensitive response (hr) in tobacco. tnphoa mutagenesis of cosmid phir11, which contains the hrp cluster, revealed two genes encoding exported or inner-membrane-spanning proteins (h.-c. huang, s. w. hutcheson, and a. collmer, mol. plant-microbe interact. 4:469-476, 1991). the gene in complementation group x, designated hrph, was subcloned on a 3.1-kb sali  fragment into pcpp30, a broad-host-range, mobilizable vector. the subclone restored the ability of hrph mutant p. syringae pv. syringae 61-2089 to elicit the hr in tobacco. dna sequence analysis of the 3.1-kb sali fragment revealed a single open reading frame encoding an 81,956-da preprotein with a typical amino-terminal signal peptide and no likely inner-membrane-spanning hydrophobic regions. hrph was expressed in the presence of [35s]methionine by using the t7 rna polymerase-promoter system and vector pt7-3 in escherichia coli and was shown to encode a protein with an apparent molecular weight of 83,000 on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. the hrph protein in e. coli was located in the membrane fraction and was absent from the periplasm and cytoplasm. the hrph protein possessed similarity with several outer membrane proteins that are known  to be involved in protein or phage secretion, including the klebsiella oxytoca puld protein, the yersinia enterocolitica yscc protein, and the piv protein of filamentous coliphages. all of these proteins possess a possible secretion motif, gg(x)12vp(l/f)lxxipxigxl(f/l), near the carboxyl terminus, and they lack a carboxyl-terminal phenylalanine, in contrast to other outer membrane proteins with no known secretion function. these results suggest that the p. syringae pv.  syringae hrph protein is involved in the secretion of a proteinaceous hr elicitor.

TI  == modulation of leukotriene generation by invasive bacteria.
AB  == the effect of invasive bacteria on the release of proinflammatory mediators (oxygen radicals, leukotriene release) from human polymorphonuclear neutrophils was studied. bacterial stimuli were used including genetically cloned invasive yersinia enterocolitica strains 108-p (bearing the phagocytosis-resistance plasmid) and 108-c (plasmidless variant), listeria monocytogenes [slcc 5779 (inv-) and nctc 7973 (inv+)] as well as an escherichia coli k 12 strain (pri 203) in which the inv gene of y. pseudotuberculosis was cloned. when human polymorphonuclear granulocytes were studied as target cells the inv+ as well as the inv- strains were phagocytosed to a comparable amount with the exception of the l. monocytogenes strain (inv+). among the invasive strains e. coli hb 101 (pri 203) was the most active to trigger polymorphonuclear leucocytes (pmn) for oxygen radical production. preincubation of the cells with bacteria and subsequent stimulation with the ca ionophore a23187 or opsonized zymosan suppressed the chemiluminescence response to a different degree. the various bacterial strains did not induce leukotriene release from endogenous arachidonic  acid. subsequent stimulation of the infected cells with ca ionophore or opsonized zymosan led to an altered pattern of the combined amounts of leukotriene b4 (ltb4), 20-oh- and 20-cooh-ltb4 as well as the ratio of ltb4 versus 20-oh and 20-cooh-ltb4. infection of the cells also reduced strain dependently the number of ltb4-receptor sites. our data suggest that bacterial uptake modulates the inflammatory response of granulocytes (e.g. chemiluminescence response, leukotriene generation).

TI  == mechanism of action of tricyclic drugs on escherichia coli and yersinia enterocolitica plasmid maintenance and replication.
AB  == tricyclic medical compounds like many other non-antibiotics exhibit antimicrobial activities. two chemically representative groups were tested in plasmid dna transformation and replication to assign intracellular target sites responsible for the multiple effects in escherichia coli and yersinia enterocolitica cells. to analyse the mechanism of action at the molecular level, the effects of chlorpromazine, 7,8 dioxochlorpromazine, promethazine, methylene blue, imipramine, cannabidiolic acid and tetrahydrocannabidiolic acid were examined at  several points in the course of transformation, in plasmid replication and on the topological state of plasmid dna. two possible target sites were identified, one  of them involving membrane binding sites which participate in plasmid dna replication. drug binding at these sites interfered with the replicating plasmid  dna and membrane protein complex, preventing the proper processing of the replication that resulted in plasmid loss. the other in vivo and in vitro effect  was observed on the topological state of plasmid dna. tricyclic drugs intefered with energy dependent gyrase activity and promoted the relaxation of plasmid dna, causing disturbances in gene expression and in plasmid replication. the results give insight into the chemical structures connected with significant specific antimicrobial effects.

TI  == evidence that the hrpb gene encodes a positive regulator of pathogenicity genes from pseudomonas solanacearum.
AB  == the hrp gene cluster of pseudomonas solanacearum gmi1000 strain encodes functions that are essential for pathogenicity on tomato and for the elicitation of the hypersensitive response on tobacco. in this study, we present the nucleotide sequence of one of the hrp genes (hrpb) located at the left-hand end of the cluster and we show that hrpb encodes a positive regulator controlling the expression of hrp genes. hrpb has a coding capacity for a 477-amino-acid polypeptide, which shows significant similarity to several prokaryotic transcriptional activators including the arac protein of escherichia coli, the xyls protein of pseudomonas putida and the virf protein of yersinia enterocolitica. the predicted hrpb gene product belongs to a family of bacterial  regulators different from the previously described hrps protein of the hrp gene cluster of pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola. genetic evidence demonstrates that the hrpb gene product acts as a positive regulator of the expression in minimal medium of all but one of the putative transcription units of the hrp gene cluster and also controls the expression of genes located outside this cluster. we also show in this paper that the transcription of hrpb is induced in minimal medium and is partly autoregulated.

TI  == fur regulation in yersinia species.
AB  == the effects of iron have been linked with several phenomena including regulation  of membrane proteins; however, the mechanism of iron regulation is not well characterized in yersinia pestis. it is well known that in escherichia coli, the  fur gene product mediates negative transcriptional regulation of several genes in response to iron. we have cloned a y. pestis fur gene which is highly homologous  to the e. coli fur regulatory gene. the sequence of the y. pestis fur gene exhibits 75% homology to the e. coli gene at the nucleotide level, and 84% homology at the predicted amino acid level. the y. pestis fur gene is transcribed as a single gene message of approximately 0.5 kb which encodes an approximately 16 kda protein when expressed in e. coli minicells. a yersinia enterocolitica fur mutant exhibits hypersensitivity to the y. pestis bacteriocin, pesticin; the cloned y. pestis fur gene restores wild-type levels of pesticin sensitivity. furthermore, iron regulation of at least five surface proteins in this y. enterocolitica fur mutant is restored by transcomplementation with the y. pestis  fur gene. these data indicate that y. pestis and y. enterocolitica possess homologous fur systems which regulate expression of proteins in response to iron  availability.

TI  == structure and regulation of the yersinia pestis yscbcdef operon.
AB  == we have investigated the physical and genetic structure and regulation of the yersinia pestis yscbcdef region, previously called lcrc. dna sequence analysis showed that this region is homologous to the corresponding part of the ysc locus  of yersinia enterocolitica and suggested that the yscbcdef cistrons belong to a single operon on the low-calcium response virulence plasmid pcd1. promoter activity measurements of ysc subclones indicated that yscbcdef constitutes a suboperon of the larger ysc region by revealing promoter activity in a clone containing the 3' end of yscd, intact ysce and yscf, and part of yscg. these experiments also revealed an additional weak promoter upstream of yscd. northern  (rna) analysis with a yscd probe showed that operon transcription is thermally induced and downregulated in the presence of ca2+. primer extension of operon transcripts suggested that two promoters, a moderate-level constitutive one and a stronger, calcium-downregulated one, control full-length operon transcription at  37 degrees c. primer extension provided additional support for the proposed designation of a yscbcdef suboperon by identifying a 5' end within yscf, for which relative abundances in the presence and absence of ca2+ revealed regulation that is distinct from that for transcripts initiating farther upstream. yscb and  yscc were expressed in escherichia coli by using a high-level transcription system. attempts to express yscd were only partially successful, but they revealed interesting regulation at the translational level.

AB  == in escherichia coli, a yope::lacz fusion was found to be regulated by temperature in the presence of the cloned bamhi g fragment of yersinia pestis plasmid pcd1, which contains the lcrf locus. increasing the copy number of lcrf relative to that of the yope reporter had a negligible effect on the induction ratio (26 versus 37 degrees c) but caused large reductions in the absolute levels of yope transcription. we localized the lcrf gene by monitoring the induction phenotype of bamhi g deletion derivatives. sequencing revealed an open reading frame capable of encoding a protein of 30.8 kda. a protein product of this size was detected in a t7 expression system, and lcrf-dependent yope-specific dna binding  activity was observed. as expected, lcrf exhibited 98% homology to virf of yersinia enterocolitica and significant homology to the carboxy termini of other  members of the arac family of transcriptional regulatory proteins. these proteins could be divided into two classes according to function: those regulating operons involved in catabolism of carbon and energy sources and those involved in regulating virulence genes. lcrf::lacz transcriptional fusions were constructed and analyzed in y. pestis and e. coli. the activity of the fusions was not affected by the native pcd1 virulence plasmid, an intact lcrf gene, or temperature. thus, induction of lcrf transcription is not essential for temperature-dependent activation of yope transcription. a portion of lcrf was found associated with the membrane fraction in e. coli; however, pulse-chase experiments indicated that this result is an artifact of fractionation.

TI  == tyrosine protein kinase inhibitors block invasin-promoted bacterial uptake by epithelial cells.
AB  == the ability to enter into (invade) mammalian cells is an essential virulence determinant of many pathogenic bacteria and intracellular parasites. these organisms are internalized by host cells upon attachment to their surface. however, the mechanisms used by intracellular parasites to induce internalization into host cells have not been defined. we found that the protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine blocks invasion by some pathogenic bacteria, including yersinia enterocolitica and yersinia pseudotuberculosis. using escherichia coli containing the cloned y. enterocolitica invasion gene inv (which codes for invasin, an integrin-binding protein), we found that staurosporine inhibits invasion by blocking bacterial internalization. two specific tyrosine protein kinase inhibitors, genistein and tyrphostin, also block the internalization but not the  binding of bacteria, suggesting that bacterial uptake may be dependent on the activity of this enzyme class in host hela cells. in contrast to invasion promoted by invasin, the invasion of hela cells by salmonella typhimurium is not  inhibited by any of these drugs.

TI  == bacterial resistance to complement killing mediated by the ail protein of yersinia enterocolitica.
AB  == ail is a 17-kda outer membrane yersinia protein that mediates bacterial attachment to, and invasion of, cultured epithelial cells. we report here an alternative role for ail in the pathogenesis of yersinia infection. we found that escherichia coli hb101 harboring the 4-kilobase recombinant ail clone pvm102 were highly resistant to killing in up to 50% normal human serum. a 674-base-pair fragment of dna from pvm102, which encodes the ail gene, was inserted into puc18  and shown to promote full resistance to complement killing in e. coli hb101. cellular attachment and resistance to complement killing in a plasmid-cured inv-  strain of yersinia enterocolitica (0:8) was correlated with the thermoinduced expression of ail at 37 degrees c. insertional inactivation of ail in y. enterocolitica resulted in loss of both thermoinduced bacterial properties. cellular attachment and serum resistance were restored by complementation of the  defect by plasmid-encoded ail. complementation of cell attachment activity required bacterial growth at 37 degrees c, indicating that an additional thermoinduced factor is required for this ail function. in addition, these studies reveal that functional homology exists between ail and the structurally related protein rck, which promotes resistance to complement killing in salmonella typhimurium.

AB  == this thesis is based on 8 publications and a review of the literature. the aim was to summarize present knowledge on molecular components of yersinia enterocolitica involved in (i) adhesion, with special reference to plasmid encoded factors and (ii) induction of antibodies in the host, and the quantitation of these two phenomena. adhesion of y. enterocolitica was quantitatively studied by methods that measured binding to cultured epithelial cells, mucosal constituents immobilized on polystyrene, intestinal tissue, and nonbiological solid surfaces. the chromosomal inv and ail gene products have been shown by others to be independently able to mediate adhesion to and invasion of cultured epithelial cells. however, the yersinia virulence plasmid, pyv, also encodes for at least one product that may mediate adhesion. it was shown that pyv carrying y. enterocolitica strains adhered more efficiently than their isogenic pyv cured derivatives to rabbit and human ileal intestinal tissue and to rabbit ileal brush border membrane vesicles (bbvs). using y. enterocolitica mutants that were defective for production of the pyv encoded outer membrane protein, yada, and escherichia coli strains carrying the cloned yada gene it was verified that yada was responsible for the pyv encoded adhesion. the yada promoted adhesion was found likely to be non-specific and, at least in part, mediated by hydrophobic interaction. yada, however, also mediated binding to one or more constituents present in intestinal mucus. such binding led to decreased ability to penetrate a layer of mucus in vitro and subsequent decreased ability to adhere to bbvs. based upon these results, it remains uncertain whether y. enterocolitica is able to benefit from the yada mediated adhesion in the intestinal millieu. in vivo results have suggested that expression of yada confers on y. enterocolitica an increased ability to colonize the intestine, but no definitive conclusions have been reached so far. a large number of antigens were identified in y. enterocolitica by means of crossed immunoelectrophoresis (xie). quantitation of serological cross-reactions between chromosome-encoded y. enterocolitica antigens and antigens from other bacterial species was performed by means of xie and proved useful for taxonomic purposes. using xie it was shown that infection with  y. enterocolitica induced an antibody response against a wide range of antigens.  tube agglutination, enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (elisas) using purified lipopolysaccharide (lps) or formalin-killed whole pyv carrying cells as antigens, and xie were evaluated for their applicability to detect recent y. enterocolitica o:3 infection.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == cross-reactive proteins of borrelia burgdorferi.
AB  == the specificity of serological tests for lyme borreliosis is impaired by cross-reacting antibodies. in order to select antigens for more specific tests, specific and cross-reactive proteins of borrelia burgdorferi must be identified.  therefore, to analyze cross reactions of borrelia burgdorferi with other bacteria, rabbit immune sera against heterologous bacteria (borrelia hermsii, treponema pallidum, treponema phagedenis, leptospira interrogans (serogroup grippotyphosa), neisseria meningitidis, haemophilus influenzae, yersinia enterocolitica (serotypes o3 and o9), campylobacter jejuni, listeria monocytogenes o1, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, shigella flexneri and legionella micdadei) were examined by western  blot using borrelia burgdorferi as antigen. broad cross reactivity was shown for  borrelia proteins of the 60-75 kda range. other broadly cross-reacting proteins were at the level of p40, p33 and two proteins in the range of 20 kda. some of the cross reactions were eliminated by absorption of the sera with treponema phagedenis. the absorbed antibodies were directed mainly against bands at the level of p33 and bands of the 60 to 75 kda range. showing the lowest potential for cross reactivity, p100, p41, ospa and pc seem to be the most suitable antigens for serodiagnosis. in contrast to p100 and ospa, however, p41 and pc showed cross reactivity with immune sera against bacteria not belonging to the genus borrelia.

TI  == interaction of heat-stable enterotoxins with human colonic (t84) cells: modulation of the activation of guanylyl cyclase.
AB  == heat-stable enterotoxins (st) activate guanylyl cyclase in t84 cells, rapidly and specifically. activation is monitored by cgmp production and occurs at lower concentrations of st than required for eliciting fluid accumulation in suckling mice. atrial natriuretic factor (anf) neither activates guanylyl cyclase nor modulates the response to st in t84 cells, indicating the absence of receptors for anf on t84 cells. monitoring the production of cgmp under conditions known to alter fluid accumulation in suckling mice is an accurate and quantifiable assay of st activity and its interaction with the receptor. sts produced by escherichia coli, vibrio cholerae non-01 and yersinia enterocolitica individually produce elevated levels of cgmp in t84 cells, but to differing extents, suggesting that this model system can be used to elucidate the different events of st-receptor interactions at the molecular level.

TI  == lipopolysaccharide o side chain of yersinia enterocolitica o:3 is an essential virulence factor in an orally infected murine model.
AB  == the rfb gene cluster of yersinia enterocolitica o:3, responsible for the biosynthesis of the o side chain, was previously cloned, and a y. enterocolitica  o:3 side chain-specific bacteriophage (phi yeo3-12) was isolated (a. al-hendy, p. toivanen, and m. skurnik, microb. pathog. 10:47-59, 1991). this paper describes the isolation and characterization of the bacteriophage phi yeo3-12-resistant mutant of y. enterocolitica o:3, yeo3-r2. lipopolysaccharide isolated from yeo3-r2 lacked the o side chain, as evidenced by silver staining and by immunoblots probed with a y. enterocolitica o:3 o side chain-specific monoclonal  antibody. the core was complete, as shown in immunoblots probed with an outer core-specific monoclonal antibody. in southern blotting with the cloned y. enterocolitica o:3 rfb region as a probe, there was no detectable difference in the hybridization pattern of chromosomal dna isolated from yeo3-r2 and that isolated from wild-type y. enterocolitica o:3. this suggests that a point mutation, rather than a large deletion, was responsible for the rough phenotype of yeo3-r2. the virulence of yeo3-r2 was determined in an orally infected desferal-attenuated murine model. the mutant was approximately 50-fold less virulent than the isogenic wild type. the ability of yeo3-r2 to reexpress o side  chain, and hence full virulence, was reconstituted by complementing the chromosomal mutation in trans with the distal 6.5 kb of the y. enterocolitica o:3 rfb region. this same 6.5-kb fragment transcomplemented a transposon mutation in  the same area of the y. enterocolitica o:3 rfb region when expressed in escherichia coli. this transcomplementation implies that the rfb region of y. enterocolitica o:3 is organized into at least two separate operons.

TI  == a lipoprotein of yersinia enterocolitica facilitates ferrioxamine uptake in escherichia coli.
AB  == a cloned fragment of yersinia enterocolitica dna complemented the defect in ferrioxamine b uptake of an escherichia coli fhue mutant lacking the outer membrane high-affinity transport protein fhue. subcloning revealed that a 13.7-kda outer membrane protein was required for complementation. the amino acid  sequence deduced from the nucleotide sequence showed extensive homology to pcphi, an outer membrane lipoprotein of haemophilus influenzae. we therefore termed this protein pcpye. plasmid-encoded pcpy mediated a low-affinity uptake of ferrioxamine b which may be caused by changes in the permeability of the outer membrane due to an overexpression of this outer membrane protein. a transposon insertion mutant in the plasmid-encoded pcpy gene was transferred into the chromosome of y. enterocolitica. the resulting mutation had no effect on the high-affinity uptake of ferrioxamine b in yersinia cells. using the antibiotic ferrimycin we were able to isolate a y. enterocolitica mutant lacking the high-affinity outer membrane receptor for ferrioxamine uptake, termed foxa.

TI  == binding of cultured mammalian cells to immobilized bacteria.
AB  == the invasin protein of yersinia pseudotuberculosis binds to integrin receptors on mammalian cells and promotes cellular penetration. we demonstrate here that the cell attachment activity of invasin can be detected in bacterial colonies that have been immobilized on filter membranes. invasin expressed in either escherichia coli k-12 or y. pseudotuberculosis mediated binding to membranes, and as few as 10(5) y. pseudotuberculosis resulted in detectable attachment of cultured epithelial cells. a similar binding activity was detected in clinical isolates of the related pathogen y. enterocolitica but not in environmental isolates. although there exist multiple mechanisms for the binding of wild-type organisms to host cells, efficient mammalian cell binding to immobilized y. pseudotuberculosis required expression of a functional invasin protein. several pathogens that are known to bind or penetrate mammalian cells were also tested, and only one of these bound cultured mammalian cells efficiently.

TI  == cloning and characterization of the eae gene of enterohaemorrhagic escherichia coli o157:h7.
AB  == the eae (escherichia coli attaching and effacing) gene from enteropathogenic escherichia coli (epec) was previously shown to be essential for production of the 'attaching and effacing' histopathology characteristic of epec infections (jerse et al., 1990). we have now cloned the eae gene from enterohaemorrhagic e.  coli (ehec) which, in addition to producing shiga-like cytotoxins, also produces  the attaching and effacing effect. the sequence homology between the epec and ehec sequences was 86% and 83% at the nucleotide and amino acid levels, respectively. the predicted amino acid sequence of the ehec eae gene shared 31% identity and 51% similarity with invasin of yersinia pseudotuberculosis. alignment of the epec and ehec eae proteins and the y. pseudotuberculosis and y.  enterocolitica invasins shows striking regions of identity with the greatest divergence at the c-terminal end, the putative receptor-binding portion of invasin.

TI  == molecular cloning, iron-regulation and mutagenesis of the irp2 gene encoding hmwp2, a protein specific for the highly pathogenic yersinia.
AB  == under iron-starvation, the highly pathogenic yersinia synthesize several iron-regulated proteins including two high-molecular-weight polypeptides (hmwp1 and hmwp2). from the chromosome of yersinia enterocolitica serovar o:8 (strain ye 8081), the genes coding for the hmwp2 (irp2) and its promoter were cloned into plasmid puc18 (pir2) and used as a probe. we show here that the irp2 gene is present only in the highly pathogenic strains and that its promoter is iron-regulated in escherichia coli. after introduction of the pir2 plasmid into a fur mutant of e. coli, both the iron-starved and the iron-replete bacteria expressed the hmwp2. repressibility of irp2 by iron was restored by introduction  of a plasmid carrying the fur gene. these results demonstrate that the irp2 promoter is controlled by the fur repressor in e. coli. mutagenesis of the chromosomal irp2 gene of yersinia pseudotuberculosis was obtained by homologous recombination with a 1 kb fragment of this gene cloned on the suicide plasmid pjm703.1. inactivation of irp2 resulted in the non-expression of both hmwps, while introduction of plasmid pir2 into the mutant strain led to the synthesis of the hmwp2 only. therefore, it is probable that the genes coding for the hmwps constitute an operon where irp2 is upstream of irp1. when comparing the virulence of the wild-type strain and of its irp2 mutant derivative, we found that the 50%  lethality (ld50) for mice of the mutant strain was increased, whatever the route  of infection, but more markedly when injected parenterally. accordingly, these data demonstrate that a mutation in the irp2 gene alters the pathogenicity of y.  pseudotuberculosis.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == the serological relationship between escherichia coli o157 and yersinia enterocolitica o9 using sera from patients with brucellosis.
AB  == sera from ten patients with positive brucella serology were used to investigate antibody cross-reactions between the o-antigens of escherichia coli o157 and yersinia enterocolitica o9. sds-page profiles of lipopolysaccharide (lps), purified from strains of e. coli o157 and y. enterocolitica o9, were reacted with sera by immunoblotting. all ten sera contained antibodies which bound to the lps  of e. coli o157, and five of these sera also contained antibodies which bound to  the lps of y. enterocolitica o9. absorption studies using these five cross-reacting sera indicated the existence of at least three epitopes exposed on the o-antigens of e. coli o157 and y. enterocolitica o9. one antigen binding site appeared to be exposed on the lps of both organisms, while one epitope was exposed on the lps of e. coli o157 only, and another on the lps of y. enterocolitica o9 only.

TI  == amino acid substitutions in naturally occurring variants of ail result in altered invasion activity.
AB  == yersinia enterocolitica is the causative agent of a variety of gastrointestinal syndromes ranging from acute enteritis to mesenteric lymphadenitis. in addition,  systemic infections resulting in high mortality rates can occur in elderly and immunocompromised patients. more than 50 serotypes of y. enterocolitica have been identified, but only a few of them commonly cause disease in otherwise healthy hosts. those serotypes that cause disease have been divided into two groups, american and non-american, based on their geographical distributions, biotypes, and pathogenicity. we have been studying two genes, inv and ail, from y. enterocolitica that confer in tissue culture assays an invasive phenotype that strongly correlates with virulence. some differences between the american and non-american serotypes at the ail locus were noted previously and have been investigated further in this report. the ail locus was cloned from seven y. enterocolitica strains (seven different serotypes). although the different clones produced similar amounts of ail, the product of the ail gene from non-american serotypes (ailna) was less able to promote invasion by escherichia coli than was  the product of the ail gene from american serotypes (aila). this difference is probably due to one or more of the eight amino acid changes found in the derived  amino acid sequence for the mature form of ailna compared with that of aila. seven of these changes are predicted to be in cell surface domains of the protein (a model for the proposed folding of ail within the outer membrane is presented). these results are discussed in relation to the growing family of outer membrane proteins, which includes lom from bacteriophage lambda, pagc from salmonella typhimurium, and ompx from enterobacter cloacae.

TI  == catecholamine induced growth of gram negative bacteria.
AB  == the addition of various catecholamines to cultures of gram negative bacteria resulted in dramatic increases in growth. the ability of norepinephrine, epinephrine, dopamine and dopa to enhance the growth of escherichia coli, yersinia enterocolitica and pseudomonas aeruginosa was observed to be dependent on the bacterium employed with each strain showing marked preference for one or more of the catecholamines. catecholamine induced increases in growth were confirmed by one or more of the following methods: uptake of tritiated thymidine  into newly synthesized dna, changes in optical density or pour plate analysis. none of the catecholamine metabolites resulting from either oxidative deamination or catechol-o-methylation were able to effect similar increases in bacterial growth as compared to either norepinephrine, epinephrine or dopamine. norepinephrine was consistently observed to effect the greatest increase in bacterial growth for all strains tested.

TI  == the salmonella typhimurium virulence plasmid complement resistance gene rck is homologous to a family of virulence-related outer membrane protein genes, including pagc and ail.
AB  == a fragment of the salmonella typhimurium virulence plasmid containing the rck locus, when cloned in the recombinant cosmid pade016, was shown previously to confer high-level complement resistance on both rough and smooth escherichia coli, salmonella minnesota, and s. typhimurium and was associated with the production of an outer membrane protein. we determined the nucleotide sequence of the fragment containing the rck locus. mutations in the two major open reading frames confirmed that the complement resistance mediated by pade016 was due to a  single 555-bp rck gene encoding a 17-kda outer membrane protein. analysis of the  rck gene revealed that the rck outer membrane protein consisted of 185 amino acid residues, with a calculated postcleavage molecular mass of 17.4 kda. rck is homologous to a family of outer membrane proteins expressed in gram-negative bacteria, two of which have been associated with virulence-related phenotypes: pagc, required by s. typhimurium for survival in macrophages and for virulence in mice; and ail, a product of the yersinia enterocolitica chromosome capable of mediating bacterial adherence to and invasion of epithelial cell lines. rck, most closely related to pagc, represents the third outer membrane protein in this five-member family with a distinct virulence-associated phenotype.

TI  == the prevalence of enteric pathogens in diarrhoeic thoroughbred foals in britain and ireland.
AB  == a survey of 77 normal and 326 diarrhoeic foals in britain and ireland from 1987 to 1989 revealed a significantly higher prevalence of group a rotaviruses and aeromonas hydrophila in diarrhoeic foals. the prevalence of cryptosporidia, potentially pathogenic escherichia coli, yersinia enterocolitica and clostridium  perfringens was similar in normal or diarrhoeic foals. rotaviruses had a similar  prevalence in all age groups of scouring foals up to three months of age, with an overall prevalence of 37 per cent among diarrhoeic foals. the number of cases of  diarrhoea varied considerably from year to year, but in all three years of the survey rotavirus was a significant pathogen. a comparison of diagnostic tests for rotavirus in the faeces showed electron microscopy (em) and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (page) to have similar sensitivity. the rotazyme elisa test kit was found to have the same sensitivity as a combination of em and page. a. hydrophila had an overall prevalence of 9 per cent among diarrhoeic foals, although its prevalence was higher in some age groups. a. hydrophila has not been established previously as a significant enteric pathogen in foals. other putative pathogens found at very low prevalence were coronavirus, the putative picobirnavirus, campylobacter spp. and salmonella spp. no evidence was found of synergistic effects between rotavirus, cryptosporidia and potentially pathogenic  e. coli. neither coccidia nor non-group a rotaviruses were found in any of the samples examined.

TI  == therapy for acute infectious diarrhea in children.
AB  == this article reviews current recommendations of therapy with antidiarrheal compounds and antimicrobial agents for acute infectious diarrhea in children. in  most infants and children with acute infectious diarrhea, treatment with antidiarrheal compounds is not indicated. many of these compounds interfere with  identification of enteropathogens in stool specimens, and the antimotility class  has an overdose potential. antimicrobial therapy is given to reduce symptoms and  to prevent the spread of infection by decreasing fecal shedding of organisms. although effective therapy is not available for patients with enteric viruses, cryptosporidium, and microsporidium, therapy is useful for children with amebiasis, antimicrobial-associated colitis, cholera, giardiasis, various forms of escherichia coli diarrhea and salmonella disease, isosporiasis, shigellosis, and strongyloidiasis. for several other conditions, antimicrobial therapy is of questionable benefit (infection with campylobacter jejuni or yersinia enterocolitica, intestinal salmonellosis and enterohemorrhagic e. coli infection). compounds such as the fluoroquinolones, which are effective in the treatment of acute infectious diarrhea in adults, are not approved for use in children because of potential side effects. many bacterial, viral, and parasitic  organisms cause acute infectious diarrhea; appropriate antimicrobial therapy requires the accurate, rapid identification of the offending enteropathogen. in children with an underlying illness such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, manifestations may be prolonged, severe, and recurrent despite appropriate therapy.

TI  == role of the yersinia outer membrane protein yada in adhesion to rabbit intestinal tissue and rabbit intestinal brush border membrane vesicles.
AB  == the yersinia virulence plasmid confers on strains of yersinia pseudotuberculosis  and y. enterocolitica an adhesive potential superior to the one encoded by the chromosome alone. we have evaluated the role of the plasmid-encoded outer membrane protein yada (formerly called yopl) in adhesion. insertional inactivation of the yada gene (formerly called yopa), which encodes yada, led to  a reduction in the capacity of plasmid-carrying strains of y. pseudotuberculosis  0:iii and y. enterocolitica 0:9 to adhere to intestinal tissue, brush border membranes and polystyrene surfaces. the adhesive characteristics of the mutants were comparable to those of their plasmid-cured counterparts. when the yada gene  from y. pseudotuberculosis serotype 0:iii or y. enterocolitica serotype 0:3 or 0:8 was cloned into an escherichia coli strain, increased ability to adhere to intestinal tissue, brush border membrane vesicles and polystyrene was transferred concomitantly. the introduction of the yada gene from y. pestis, which is unable  to express yada due to a one base pair deletion, did not change the adhesive characteristics of e. coli. expression of yada in the outer membrane may, therefore, make an important contribution to intestinal adherence of the two enteropathogenic members of the yersinia species, y. pseudotuberculosis and y. enterocolitica.

AB  == pork slurries inoculated with various test microorganisms were prepared and subjected to high hydrostatic pressure at 1000 to 6000 atm for 10 min at 25 degrees c to examine for the pressure effects on characteristics of the slurries  and the inactivation of the microorganisms associated with meat and meat products. pressure treatment at higher than 3000 atm caused coagulation and discoloration of the pork slurries. harder and more white coagulants were obtained by increasing the pressure. pressure treatment at 3000 to 6000 atm killed all the microorganisms tested by more than 6-log colony-forming units (cfu)/g except bacillus cereus spores. gram-negative microorganisms were more labile to pressure than gram-positive ones. campylobacter jejuni, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhimurium and yersinia enterocolitica were inactivated at pressures higher than 3000 atm; escherichia coli, saccharomyces cerevisiae and candida utilis at pressures higher than 4000 atm; micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus faecalis at 6000 atm. only less than one-log cfu/g of b. cereus spores were inactivated at 6000 atm. ultraviolet absorption spectra and acridine orange staining suggested that e. coli became permeable and leaked cytoplasmic rna at lower pressure than s. aureus. from the present findings, the authors propose high hydrostatic pressure treatment as a promising means of preparing wholesome meat and meat products.

TI  == the omph gene of yersinia enterocolitica: cloning, sequencing, expression, and comparison with known enterobacterial omph sequences.
AB  == we have recently described a previously uncharacterized outer membrane protein of salmonella typhimurium and escherichia coli and cloned and sequenced the corresponding gene, the omph gene, of s. typhimurium (p. koski, m. rhen, j. kantele, and m. vaara, j. biol. chem. 264:18973-18980, 1989). we report here the  cloning, sequencing, and expression of the corresponding gene of yersinia enterocolitica. it is significantly homologous to the omph genes of e. coli and s. typhimurium (homology percentages, 65 and 64%, respectively), has a promoter region strongly homologous to the e. coli 17-bp class consensus promoter, and encodes a protein consisting of 165 amino acids (22 of which form the signal sequence). the plasmid-borne y. enterocolitica omph was found to be expressed both in the e. coli host and in minicells. the isolated outer membrane of y. enterocolitica was shown to contain omph. the homology of the y. enterocolitica omph protein is 66% with e. coli omph and 64% with s. typhimurium omph. all omph  proteins have almost identical hydrophobic profiles, charge distributions, and predicted secondary structures. because yersiniae are considered rather distant relatives of e. coli and s. typhimurium in the enterobacteriaceae family, these results might indicate that most or all strains of the family enterobacteriaceae  have omph proteins remarkably homologous to those now sequenced.

AB  == a study was conducted of travelers' diarrhea in a united states military population on deployment in cairo, egypt, during july and august 1987. acute diarrhea requiring medical attention developed in 183 (4%) of 4,500 troops. a possible etiologic agent was identified in 49% of all diarrhea cases. enteric pathogens associated with cases of diarrhea included: enterotoxigenic escherichia coli (17% st-producers, 13% lt-producers, and 3% lt/st-producers); shigella (9%); campylobacter spp. (2%); salmonella (2%); and vibrio cholerae non-01 serogroup (2%). other enteric pathogens isolated from one episode each of diarrhea included aeromonas hydrophila group, plesiomonas shigelloides, and bacillus cereus. yersinia enterocolitica, enteroinvasive e. coli, intoxications by clostridium perfringens and clostridium difficile, and pathogenic enteric parasites were not  found in any of the 183 patients with diarrhea. a survey of military personnel not requesting medical care indicated that up to 40% of troops may have had diarrhea during this deployment. acute gastroenteritis is a potential cause of substantial morbidity in u.s. military personnel deployed to egypt.

AB  == a monoclonal antibody (mab 4e8c12) specific for escherichia coli o157:h7 and o26:h11 was produced by immunizing balb/c mice with a rough strain of e. coli o157:h7. the antibody reacted strongly by a direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with each of 36 strains of e. coli o157:h7. no cross-reactivity was observed with strains of salmonella spp., yersinia enterocolitica, shigella dysenteriae, proteus spp., escherichia hermanii, klebsiella pneumoniae, campylobacter jejuni, serratia marcescens, citrobacter spp., enterobacter cloacae, hafnia alvei, aeromonas hydrophila, and all except five strains of e. coli other than serotype o157:h7 (including strains of serotype o157 but not h7). the e. coli strains (all of serotype o26:h11) that reacted with the antibody were enterohemorrhagic e. coli (ehec) that were isolated from patients with hemolytic  uremic syndrome or hemorrhagic colitis and produced verotoxin similar to that of  e. coli o157:h7. mab 4e8c12 belongs to the subclass immunoglobulin g2a and has a  kappa light chain. tricine-sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of outer membrane proteins of e. coli of different serotypes followed by western immunoblot analysis revealed that mab 4e8c12 reacted specifically with two proteins of ehec strains of serotypes o157:h7 and o26:h11 with apparent molecular weights of 5,000 to 6,000. these proteins appeared to be  markers specific for ehec strains of serotypes o157:h7 and o26:h11. this mab, because of its specificity, may be a useful reagent of an immunoassay for the rapid detection of these types of ehec isolates in clinical and food specimens.

TI  == interactions between yersinia enterocolitica and rabbit ileal mucus: growth, adhesion, penetration, and subsequent changes in surface hydrophobicity and ability to adhere to ileal brush border membrane vesicles.
AB  == interactions between yersinia enterocolitica and rabbit ileal mucus were examined. strains carrying the yersinia virulence plasmid, pyv, adhered to crude  mucus but not to intestinal luminal contents that had been immobilized on polystyrene. using an y. enterocolitica o:9 mutant in which the yada gene (formerly called yopa), encoding the high-molecular-weight outer membrane protein yada (formerly called protein p1 or yop1), had been inactivated and an escherichia coli strain carrying the cloned yada gene, we demonstrated that the ability to adhere to mucus correlated closely to expression of yada. thereafter,  we evaluated possible consequences of binding between pyv-carrying y. enterocolitica o:3 strains and constituents in the mucus layer. pyv-carrying strains were able to multiply at a high rate in mucus but not in luminal contents, and the ability to adhere to mucus could therefore facilitate bacterial colonization of the mucosa. however, we also showed in vitro that mucus acted as  a barrier for a mucus-adherent, pyv-carrying y. enterocolitica strain. furthermore, penetration through, or preincubation with, mucus reduced subsequent adhesion of the pyv-carrying strain to brush border membrane vesicles without simultaneously causing bacterial aggregation. preincubation with mucus also changed the bacterial surface of the same strain from hydrophobic to hydrophilic. immunoglobulins present in mucus did not seem to be of importance for our observations. interaction of y. enterocolitica with intestinal mucus may thus reflect a host defense mechanism that reduces the pyv-mediated adhesion to the epithelial cell membrane, possibly by rendering the bacteria less hydrophobic.

TI  == identification and cloning of a fur regulatory gene in yersinia pestis.
AB  == yersinia pestis is one of many microorganisms responding to environmental iron concentrations by regulating the synthesis of proteins and an iron transport system(s). in a number of bacteria, expression of iron uptake systems and other virulence determinants is controlled by the fur regulatory protein. dna hybridization analysis revealed that both pigmented and nonpigmented cells of y.  pestis possess a dna locus homologous to the escherichia coli fur gene. introduction of a fur-regulated beta-galactosidase reporter gene into y. pestis kim resulted in iron-responsive beta-galactosidase activity, indicating that y. pestis kim expresses a functional fur regulatory protein. a cloned 1.9-kb clai fragment of y. pestis chromosomal dna hybridized specifically to the fur gene of  e. coli. the coding region of the e. coli fur gene hybridized to a 1.1-kb region  at one end of the cloned y. pestis fragment. the failure of this clone to complement an e. coli fur mutant suggests that the 1.9-kb clone does not contain  a functional promoter. subcloning of this fragment into an inducible expression vector restored fur regulation in an e. coli fur mutant. in addition, a larger 4.8-kb y. pestis clone containing the putative promoter region complemented the fur- phenotype. these results suggest that y. pestis possesses a functional fur regulatory protein capable of interacting with the e. coli fur system. in y. pestis fur may regulate the expression of iron transport systems and other virulence factors in response to iron limitation in the environment. possible candidates for fur regulation in y. pestis include genes involved in ferric iron  transport as well as hemin, heme/hemopexin, heme/albumin, ferritin, hemoglobin, and hemoglobin/haptoglobin utilization.

TI  == the effect of growth temperature on the biosynthesis of yersinia enterocolitica o:3 lipopolysaccharide: temperature regulates the transcription of the rfb but not of the rfa region.
AB  == the rfb region of yersinia enterocolitica o:3 (yeo3) that determines the synthesis of the o-side chain of the lipopolysaccharide was cloned and expressed  in escherichia coli k12 previously. the clone did not show the in vitro temperature variation in o-side chain expression known for yeo3, instead analogous o-side-chain was produced at 25 degrees c and at 37 degrees c and both  were similar to that produced by yeo3 at 25 degrees c. in northern blot analysis  marked reduction in the amount of rfb-specific mrna was observed from yeo3 grown  at 37 degrees c when compared with those grown at 25 degrees c. on the other hand, equal amounts of rfb-specific mrna were detected in the e. coli clone at both growth temperatures. this indicates that the transcription of yeo3 rfb region is dramatically repressed at 37 degrees c. the repressor gene is located outside the rfb region with no analogous locus in e. coli chromosome. we cloned 18.2 kilobase pairs of yeo3 chromosomal dna that rendered e. coli k12 reactive with 2b5, a yeo3 core-specific monoclonal antibody, in colony blotting, indirect  immunofluorescence and immunoblotting. hence this clone contains the yeo3 rfa region, encompassing the genes involved in the core oligosaccharide biosynthesis. no apparent difference, in the aforementioned tests, was noticed in the expression of the 2b5 epitope at different growth temperatures either in yeo3 or  in e. coli. in northern blot analysis comparable amounts of rfa-specific mrna were detected at 25 degrees and 37 degrees c. this argues that in yeo3 the core oligosaccharide biosynthesis is not temperature-regulated.

AB  == the genes of yersinia enterocolitica serotype o:3 (yeo3) that determine the synthesis of the o-side-chain of the lipopolysaccharide, the rfb region, were cloned into plasmid pbr322. the o-side-chain of yeo3 was expressed by the clone both in escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium indicating that the entire rfb region was included in the clone. it was shown by restriction mapping, deletion analysis and transposition mutagenesis that about 10.4 kilobase pairs of dna was essential for the synthesis and expression of the o-side-chain. the correct assembly of the o-side-chain on the cell surface of the clone was confirmed by immunofluorescence microscopy and slide agglutination. immunoblotting using monoclonal antibody specific for the o-side-chain of yeo3 revealed that the o-side-chain material synthesized by the clone in e. coli was similar to that of yeo3. the clone did not show the in vitro temperature variation in o-side-chain expression characteristic of yeo3. instead analogous o-side-chain was produced both at 25 degrees c and at 37 degrees c. using transposon tn2507, which carries a promotorless chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (cat) gene, transcriptional fusions with the target dna were generated. when testing the ability of mutated clones to produce cat, transcription was shown to  occur in a uniform direction throughout the whole rfb region. in colony hybridizations, using the cloned insert as a probe, homologous dna was detected only in pathogenic y. enterocolitica serotypes.

AB  == the ability of brobactam to inhibit beta-lactamases and the in vitro activity of  ampicillin combined with brobactam was compared with another beta-lactamase inhibitor, clavulanic acid, and other beta-lactam antibiotics. both inhibitors showed good and similar activity against staphylococcal penicillinase and most broad-spectrum beta-lactamases found in the enterobacteriaceae, whether plasmid or chromosomally mediated. both inhibitors were less active against chromosomally mediated cephalosporinases in enterobacteriaceae, but brobactam was 8-50 times more potent than clavulanic acid. the amount and type of beta-lactamase produced  by a particular bacterial strain was reflected in its sensitivity to a combination of ampicillin and brobactam, and correlated well with the sensitivity of extracted beta-lactamase to inhibition by brobactam. the in-vitro activity of  ampicillin/brobactam in a 3:1 ratio was compared to amoxycillin/clavulanic acid (4:1 ratio), amoxycillin, cefaclor and cefuroxime. the two inhibitor combinations were generally of similar activity, but the brobactam combination had superior activity against proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, citrobacter freundii and  yersinia enterocolitica. the cephalosporins were less effective against the bacteroides fragilis group, prot. vulgaris and m. morganii, but had advantages in the case of escherichia coli, klebsiella spp. and c. diversus. the mbc of ampicillin/brobactam was similar to the mic. no resistant sub-populations were observed amongst the staphylococcal strains investigated. exposure of bacteria to sub-inhibitory levels of ampicillin/brobactam did not lead generally to the development of resistance.

AB  == a series of lipoproteins was detected in the membrane fraction of yersinia enterocolitica w227, a typical strain from serotype o:9. at least two of them, ylpa and ylpb, are encoded by the pyv plasmid. the sequence of ylpa reveals the presence of a typical lipoprotein signal peptide. the mature ylpa protein would be 223 residues long with a calculated molecular weight of 23798 for the proteic  moiety of the molecule. ylpa shares 88% identical residues with the trat protein  encoded by plasmid ped208, 80% identity with trat proteins encoded by plasmids r100 and f, and 77% identity with the trat protein encoded by the virulence plasmid of salmonella typhimurium. the ylpa gene hybridized with the pyv plasmid  of yersinia pseudotuberculosis, suggesting that this gene is conserved among yersinia spp. the production of ylpa is controlled by virf and only occurs at 37  degrees c in the absence of ca2+ ions. this co-regulation with the yop genes suggests that ylpa is a virulence determinant. however, mutations in ylpa clearly affect neither the resistance to human serum nor the virulence for intravenously  inoculated mice.

TI  == nucleotide sequence of yst, the yersinia enterocolitica gene encoding the heat-stable enterotoxin, and prevalence of the gene among pathogenic and nonpathogenic yersiniae.
AB  == the gene encoding the heat-stable enterotoxin (yst) was cloned from the chromosome of yersinia enterocolitica w1024 (serotype o:9), and the nucleotide sequence was determined. the yst gene encodes a 71-amino-acid polypeptide. the c-terminal 30 amino acids of the predicted protein exactly correspond to the amino acid sequence of the toxin extracted from culture supernatants (t. takao, n. tominaga, and y. shimonishi, biochem. biophys. res. commun. 125:845-851, 1984). the n-terminal 18 amino acids have the properties of a signal sequence. the central 22 residues are removed during or after the secretion process. this organization in three domains (pre, pro, and mature yst) resembles that of the enterotoxin sta of escherichia coli. the degree of conservation between the e. coli and y. enterocolitica toxins is much lower in the pre and the pro domains than in the mature proteins. the mature toxin of y. enterocolitica is much larger than that of e. coli, but the active domain appears to be highly conserved. the yst gene of y. enterocolitica introduced in e. coli k-12 directed the secretion of an active toxin. the cloned yst gene was used as an epidemiological probe among a collection of 174 strains representative of all yersinia species except yersinia pestis and numerous y. enterocolitica subgroups. in y. enterocolitica, there was a clear-cut difference between pathogenic and nonpathogenic strains: 89 of 89 pathogenic and none of 51 nonpathogenic strains contained yst-homologous dna, suggesting that yst is involved in pathogenesis. among the other yersinia species, only four strains of yersinia kristensenii had dna homologous to yst.

AB  == the inv locus of yersinia enterocolitica is sufficient to convert a non-invasive  escherichia coli k12 strain into a microorganism that is able to penetrate cultured mammalian cells. the nucleotide sequence of inv reveals an open reading  frame corresponding to an 835-amino-acid protein that is homologous to the invasin protein from yersinia pseudotuberculosis. a polyclonal antiserum elicited by a synthetic peptide corresponding to the c-terminal 88 amino acids of this open reading frame detected a unique 100 kd protein in cell lysates of y. enterocolitica strain 8081 c and in an e. coli strain harbouring the cloned inv gene. this protein localized to the outer membranes of both microorganisms and was cleaved by low concentrations of extracellular trypsin. hep-2 cells were shown to attach to surfaces coated with bacterial outer membranes containing invasin and this attachment was destroyed by treatment of the membranes with trypsin. thus it appears that the invasin protein from y. enterocolitica is able  to mediate both attachment to and entry of cultured epithelial cells.

AB  == hep-2 cell monolayers were challenged with genetic variants of yersinia pseudotuberculosis ypiii(pib1) and yersinia enterocolitica w22708(pyl4). both strains were represented by (i) variants harboring the 70-kilobase virulence plasmid, (ii) their isogenic plasmid-cured derivatives, and (iii) two transposon  mutants constructed by insertional inactivation of the plasmid genes encoding outer membrane protein yop1 and ca2+ dependency in strains ypiii(pib1) and w22708(pyl4). when the hep-2 cells were pretreated with recombinant alpha interferon subtype a, all invasive variants of y. enterocolitica and y. pseudotuberculosis, except those variants which expressed yop1, showed a significantly reduced ability to localize intracellularly. the anti-invasive effect of interferon was abolished when the gene was expressed or when a sterile  filtered sonic extract of a yop1-producing strain was added to the cell cultures. to obtain further evidence of a potential role of yop1, a dna fragment encoding yop1 cloned into the vector pbr322 was used. after introduction of the resultant  recombinant plasmid pyms2 into the plasmid-cured variant ypiii and the yop1-negative transposon mutant ypiii(pib102) of y. pseudotuberculosis, both transformants regained the ability to produce yop1 and showed complete inhibition of the interferon effect. moreover, the sterile sonic extract of an escherichia coli strain, which carried pyms2, neutralized the anti-invasive effect of interferon. the results provide direct genetic evidence that yop1 mediates inhibition of the anti-invasive effect of interferon in hep-2 cell cultures. the  results also demonstrated that yop1 itself reduces the ability of yersinia spp. to localize intracellularly in hep-2 cells.

TI  == the yersinia enterocolitica inv gene product is an outer membrane protein that shares epitopes with yersinia pseudotuberculosis invasin.
AB  == an essential virulence attribute for yersinia enterocolitica and yersinia pseudotuberculosis is the ability to invade the intestinal epithelium of mammals. the chromosomal invasin gene (inv) has been cloned from both of these yersinia species, and the y. pseudotuberculosis invasin has been well characterized (r. r. isberg, d. l. voorhis, and s. falkow, cell 50:769-778, 1987). here we constructed tnphoa translational fusions to the y. enterocolitica inv gene to identify, characterize, and localize the inv protein product in escherichia coli. the cloned y. enterocolitica inv locus encoded a unique protein of ca. 92 kilodaltons when expressed in minicells. a protein of comparable size was detected in immunoblots by using monoclonal antibodies directed against the y. pseudotuberculosis invasin. this protein, which we also refer to as invasin, promoted both attachment to and invasion of cultured epithelial cells. these two  functions were not genetically separable by insertional mutagenesis. we determined that the y. enterocolitica invasin was localized on the outer membrane and that it was exposed on the bacterial cell surface, which may have implications for how invasin functions to mediate invasion.

TI  == yersinia enterocolitica immunodominant 60 kda antigen, common to a broad range of bacteria, is a heat-shock protein.
AB  == monoclonal antibodies (mabs) against the yersinia enterocolitica immunodominant 60 kda antigen, termed cross-reacting protein antigen (crpa), were obtained by fusion of spleen cells from mice immunized with crpa with murine myeloma cells. the reactivities of the mabs were examined by western blotting against extracts of y. enterocolitica and 23 other species of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. cross-reactions were recognized with a wide range of bacteria, but not  with gram-positive cocci. the reactivities were different for each mab, suggesting that both species-specific and multiple cross-reactive epitopes were present on the crpa molecule. crpa was produced under heat-shock conditions in y. enterocolitica and was shown to correspond immunologically to the groel protein in escherichia coli, a protein involved in the morphogenesis of coliphage. in addition to crpa, at least nine other major heat-shock proteins were detected by  two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of extracts of heat-shocked y. enterocolitica.

TI  == calcium-responsive expression of plasmid-mediated outer membrane proteins from yersinia enterocolitica grown on solid media.
AB  == in vitro synthesis of proteins directed by yersinia enterocolitica virulence plasmid dna was studied using a cell-free escherichia coli coupled transcription-translation system. out of a total of twenty-four polypeptides synthesized in vitro, ten were identified (based on virtually identical molecular masses) as outer membrane proteins synthesized in vivo when virulent plasmid-bearing y. enterocolitica cells were grown on four different solid media. two high molecular weight outer membrane proteins synthesized in vivo by plasmid-bearing cells were not detected in the in vitro protein synthesizing system. different plasmid-mediated outer membrane proteins were expressed in vivo in y. enterocolitica grown on different media. y. enterocolitica grown on media with high calcium concentration (1.4-1.5 mm) expressed twice the number of lower  molecular weight outer membrane proteins than the organism grown on low calcium (238-311 microm) media. this is the first report that a single serotype has been  shown to synthesize all the reported virulence plasmid-encoded outer membrane proteins including three new polypeptides. the constituents in the medium as well as the level of calcium appeared to have a regulatory role in plasmid gene expression for lower molecular weight outer membrane proteins.

TI  == a family of positive regulators related to the pseudomonas putida tol plasmid xyls and the escherichia coli arac activators.
AB  == the xyls family consists of a least 8 different transcriptional regulators. six of these proteins are positive regulators for the catabolism of carbon sources (benzoate and sugars) in escherichia coli, pseudomonas putida and erwinia carotovora, and two of them are involved in pathogenesis in escherichia coli and  yersinia enterocolitica. based on protein alignments, the members of this family  exhibit a long stretch of homology at the c-terminal end. the regulators involved in the catabolism of carbon sources stimulate transcription from their respectively regulated promoters only in the presence of effectors. in two of the regulators, mutations at the non-homologous n-terminus alter affinity and specificity for effectors while mutations at the conserved c-terminus part decrease activation of transcription from their corresponding regulated promoters. it is thus probable that the variable n-terminus end in this family of regulators contains the motif involved in effector recognition, while the c-terminal end is involved in dna-binding. these proteins seem to be related by common ancestry and may act through similar mechanisms of positive regulation effected through similar folding patterns.

TI  == nonpathogenic isolates of yersinia enterocolitica do not contain functional inv-homologous sequences.
AB  == previous studies have demonstrated a correlation between the ability of isolates  of yersinia enterocolitica to cause disease and to invade tissue culture cells in vitro. two genes, inv and ail, isolated from a pathogenic strain of y. enterocolitica have each been shown to confer this invasive phenotype upon escherichia coli. eighty pathogenic, invasive isolates studied by miller et al. (infect. immun. 57:121-131, 1989) contained sequences homologous to both of these genes. thirty-five nonpathogenic, noninvasive isolates similarly studied had no ail homology but carried inv-homologous sequences. we investigated inv-homologous sequences from four nonpathogenic isolates. recombinant clones of these inv-homologous sequences did not confer the invasive phenotype upon e. coli. no rna transcripts capable of encoding a full-length inv protein were detected in the four noninvasive yersinia strains. when the inv gene from a pathogenic isolate was introduced into two of these strains, the resulting transformants invaded tissue culture cells in vitro. the inv gene was transcribed in a pathogenic yersinia isolate grown at 30 degrees c but not at all in these cells grown at 37 degrees c. the production of rna transcripts homologous to inv in transformants was not regulated by temperature to the same degree as was seen for pathogenic isolates. we conclude that the inv gene in nonpathogenic strains of y. enterocolitica is nonfunctional. y. enterocolitica isolates epidemiologically linked to disease contain both a functional inv gene and a functional ail gene. environmental isolates not associated with disease have a nonfunctional inv gene  and no ail gene.

TI  == nucleotide sequence of the yersinia enterocolitica ail gene and characterization  of the ail protein product.
AB  == the ability to enter (invade) eucaryotic cells is a property common to many pathogenic bacteria. yersinia enterocolitica is a facultative intracellular pathogen whose primary site of multiplication is the reticuloendothelial system.  in an effort to understand how y. enterocolitica crosses the intestinal epithelial cell layer, we previously reported the cloning of two loci from y. enterocolitica that individually conferred an invasive phenotype to the normally  noninvasive escherichia coli hb101. one of these loci, ail, is encoded by a region of dna that is less than 650 base pairs. we have identified the ail gene product in maxicells as a 17-kilodalton membrane-associated protein. the ail protein has been purified, and its n-terminal sequence has been determined. the nucleotide sequence of the ail gene revealed a single unique open reading frame of 178 amino acids. comparison of amino acid sequences deduced from the gene and  obtained by analysis of the purified protein identified the first 23 amino acids  as a signal sequence. the site(s) at which transcription initiates on the ail gene was identified by primer extension analysis and shown to be identical in e.  coli and y. enterocolitica. two small open reading frames downstream of ail were  found and shown to exhibit considerable identity to the proposed is3 transposase.

AB  == binding of yersinia enterocolitica and yersinia pseudotuberculosis strains to type i, ii, and iv collagens has been studied. wild-type strains which harbored the 40- to 50-megadalton virulence plasmid specifically bound all three types of  collagen. curing of the virulence plasmid or tn5 insertion in the yopa gene encoding the temperature-inducible outer membrane protein yop1 abolished the binding of all three collagen types to y. enterocolitica and type i and ii collagens to y. pseudotuberculosis. full binding capacity was restored by introduction of the yopa gene into nonbinding yersinia strains. binding of type i, ii, and iv collagens was expressed in escherichia coli constructs harboring the yopa gene of either y. enterocolitica or y. pseudotuberculosis. the interaction of bacterial cells with type i collagen could be blocked by nonradiolabeled native collagens or denatured collagen but not with other serum and connective-tissue proteins. unlabeled collagen could not displace bound radiolabeled collagen. the binding was inhibited by yop1-specific polyclonal antibodies, in contrast to normal rabbit serum. the interaction was rapid and was quite resistant to heat treatment, to proteolytic enzymes, to various phs in both acidic and alkaline ranges, and to the chaotropic agent urea. we propose that this newly identified interaction may be involved both in the first steps of the  pathogenesis and in the complications of yersinia infections affecting connective tissue.

AB  == resistance to the bactericidal action of normal human serum is one of the characteristics of virulent yersinia enterocolitica. this property is attributable to the virulence plasmid harbored by pathogenic strains of the species. serum resistance in y. enterocolitica is thermoregulated, and its expression correlates well with the presence of virulence plasmid-encoded outer membrane proteins. to further examine the biochemical basis underlying resistance, we cloned a large segment (ca. 30 kilobases) of virulence plasmid dna and studied the expression of plasmid-encoded outer membrane proteins in a serum-sensitive strain of escherichia coli. the presence of the 160-kilodalton y. enterocolitica-derived outer membrane protein 1 on e. coli transformants conferred a high degree of hydrophobicity, autoagglutinability, and resistance to serum killing. all of these properties were thermoregulated in e. coli with fidelity, suggesting that a functional thermoregulatory element was present in the cloned dna. elimination of protein 1 from the outer membrane of e. coli transformants by insertional inactivation of the structural gene with a kanr gene cassette abrogated all of these properties and returned the serum-sensitive phenotype.

TI  == "new" food-borne pathogens of public health significance.
AB  == recent work by epidemiologists and microbiologists has uncovered several hitherto unrecognized food-borne bacterial pathogens of public health significance. one of these, listeria monocytogenes, has attracted considerable attention because of two major cheese-related outbreaks of listeriosis that were characterized by cases of meningitis, abortion, and perinatal septicemia. thus far, l. monocytogenes has been responsible for well over 300 reported cases of food-borne listeriosis, including about 100 deaths, and has cost the dairy industry alone more than 66 million dollars as a result of product recalls. the ability of l. monocytogenes to grow at refrigeration temperatures, coupled with appearance of the pathogen in raw and processed meats, as well as poultry, vegetables, and seafood, makes this bacterium a serious threat to susceptible consumers and to the entire food industry. yersinia enterocolitica, another psychrotrophic food-borne pathogen of recent concern, was linked to several outbreaks of yersiniosis associated with consumption of both raw and pasteurized milk, as well as contaminated water. food-borne infections involving y. enterocolitica typically result in enterocolitis, which may be mistaken for acute appendicitis.  unfortunately, inadvertent removal of healthy appendixes from victims of food-borne yersiniosis is all too common. although known for many years, campylobacter jejuni has only recently been recognized as a food-borne pathogen and a leading cause of gastroenteritis in the united states. notable outbreaks of campylobacteriosis linked to consumption of raw milk, cake icing, eggs, poultry,  and beef have underscored the need for thorough cooking and proper handling of raw products.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == [the occurrence of escherichia coli, aeromonas hydrophila, plesiomonas shigelloides and clostridium perfringens in the intestinal flora of gray herons (ardea cinerea)].
AB  == the flora of the large intestine of 92 grey herons was examined for the frequency of aerobic and microaerobic growing bacteria. clostridium perfringens, aeromonas  hydrophila, plesiomonas shigelloides and e. coli were isolated from 55%, 48%, 14% and 35% of the birds, respectively. it could be demonstrated that the findings of these bacteria in the intestinal flora are depending on the age of the birds. the percentage of carriers of clostridium perfringens, aeromonas hydrophila and plesiomonas shigelloides was highest in nestlings younger than 18 days, less high in older nestlings and lowest in adult grey herons. contrary to those bacteria, e. coli was found more often in the intestinal flora at increasing age of the birds. salmonella spp. were isolated from 6 birds. two birds yielded positive for yersinia enterocolitica and campylobacter spp., respectively. other aerobic and microaerobic bacteria play a less significant role as part of the intestinal flora.

TI  == isolation and properties of carboxylesterase p4 from yersinia pseudotuberculosis.
AB  == the carboxylesterase p4 produced by yersinia pseudotuberculosis was purified 330-fold by gel permeation and deae-trisacryl chromatography with a final yield of 21%. the apparent molecular weight, as determined by fast-protein liquid chromatography, was 45 kda. the hydrolytic activity of esterase p4 was higher with the 1-naphthyl esters than with the 2-naphthyl esters of acetic, propionic and butyric acids. the apparent km values were identical for 1-naphthyl acetate and 1-naphthyl propionate (0.15 mm). the enzyme was unstable at ph values below 5, but retained 80% of its initial activity after 30 min at 65 degrees c. it was  unaffected by edta, eserine, tosyl-l-lysine chloromethylketone, iodoacetamide or  4-hydroxymercuribenzoate, but was strongly inhibited by low concentrations of diisopropyl fluorophosphate, suggesting the presence of serine in its active site. the purified enzyme gave a single precipitin line on ouchterlony double immunodiffusion with homologous antiserum. this antiserum cross-reacted with the  esterase bands e3 and e5 of y. enterocolitica biotype 1, whereas there was no cross-reaction with the esterase bands produced by y. enterocolitica biotypes 2 to 5, y. intermedia, y. frederiksenii, y. kristensenii or y. aldovae. the carboxylesterase p4 produced by y. pestis was physicochemically, biochemically and immunologically indistinguishable from y. pseudotuberculosis carboxylesterase p4. the latter enzyme and carboxylesterase b of escherichia coli showed some biochemical similarities, but were antigenically unrelated. our data confirm the  relevance of esterases to phylogenetic and taxonomic studies of enterobacteria.

TI  == rapid enumeration of viable bacteria by image analysis.
AB  == a direct viable counting method for enumerating viable bacteria was modified and  made compatible with image analysis. a comparison was made between viable cell counts determined by the spread plate method and direct viable counts obtained using epifluorescence microscopy either manually or by automatic image analysis.  cultures of escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, vibrio cholerae, yersinia enterocolitica and pseudomonas aeruginosa were incubated at 35 degrees c in a dilute nutrient medium containing nalidixic acid. filtered samples were stained for epifluorescence microscopy and analysed manually as well as by image analysis. cells enlarged after incubation were considered viable. the viable cell counts determined using image analysis were higher than those obtained by either  the direct manual count of viable cells or spread plate methods. the volume of sample filtered or the number of cells in the original sample did not influence the efficiency of the method. however, the optimal concentration of nalidixic acid (2.5-20 micrograms ml-1) and length of incubation (4-8 h) varied with the culture tested. the results of this study showed that under optimal conditions, the modification of the direct viable count method in combination with image analysis microscopy provided an efficient and quantitative technique for counting viable bacteria in a short time.

AB  == a monoclonal antibody against the yersinia enterocolitica 60-kilodalton (kda) antigen, designated cross-reacting protein antigen (crpa), was obtained by cell fusion. the crpa common to gram-negative bacteria was purified from y. enterocolitica by the affinity chromatography with the monoclonal antibody (igg1) thus obtained. the purified crpa showed a single band of 60 kda in sds-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page), and reacted with rabbit antisera against y. enterocolitica, vibrio cholerae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and shigella sonnei in western blot analysis. the monoclonal antibody, however, reacted with a 60 kda peptide from y. enterocolitica, but not with the antigens from other gram-negative bacteria such  as v. cholerae, e. coli, s. sonnei, salmonella enteritidis, serratia marcescens,  klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and p. aeruginosa. the results suggested that both species-specific and cross-reactive epitopes were present on  a crpa molecule.

TI  == [bacterial etiological factors of diarrhea in the stool of infants hospitalized in january 1987].
AB  == the results are presented of the second part of the studies conducted for monitoring of the variability of bacterial factors causing diarrhoea in the youngest children. the presently reported study comprised 42 babies aged from 7 days to 18 months treated in hospital in january 1987. the number of children with diarrhoea hospitalized in this period was relatively smaller than in january 1985, while the incidence of enteropathogenic bacteria in stools was very similar. they included mainly klebsiella and enteropathogenic escherichia coli strains, especially in the youngest children. in only one case salmonella arizonae was found while in 1985 a very high number of salmonella agona strains were cultured, especially from newborns. in both parts of the study campylobacter jejuni and yersinia enterocolitica were never found in stools. in both parts of the study the course of bacterial diarrhoea was mostly moderately severe, loose stools continued usually for 3-4 days, but in the second part more cases of severe diarrhoea were noted, which, however, could not have been related to the bacterial species cultured from stools or to the presence of mixed bacterial flora. the importance is stressed of the carrier state of enteropathogenic bacteria which was observed in three-fourths of patients in january 1987, while in january 1985 this was present in nearly all cases without diarrhoea.

AB  == enzyme-capture assays (ecas) for escherichia coli beta-d-glucuronidase (gud) were performed directly from 24-h gas-positive lauryl tryptose broth (ltb) fermentation tubes that had been inoculated with oyster homogenate seeded with e. coli. the ltb-eca method yielded results in 1 day that were equivalent to those obtained in 2 days by an ltb and ec-4-methylumbelliferyl-beta-d-glucuronide (ec-mug) method. overall, 62 of 64 (97%) positive ec-mug broths from which e. coli was isolated were correctly identified by eca. of 61 ltb tubes identified as gud negative by eca, 59 were confirmed to be free of e. coli by using ec-mug; thus, the false-negative rate was approximately 3%. polyclonal antibodies prepared against e. coli gud reacted only with guds of e. coli, escherichia vulneris, and shigella sonnei. the antibodies did not react with guds from flavobacterium spp., staphylococcus spp., yersinia enterocolitica, shellfish, or  bovine liver. the gud eca test, when used in conjunction with the most-probable-number technique, was a rapid method for e. coli enumeration in oysters.

TI  == homology between virf, the transcriptional activator of the yersinia virulence regulon, and arac, the escherichia coli arabinose operon regulator.
AB  == virulent yersiniae (yersinia pestis, y. pseudotuberculosis, and y. enterocolitica) restrict their growth at 37 degrees c in rich medium deprived of  calcium. this property, called calcium dependency, correlates with the secretion  of yersinia outer membrane proteins (yops) and with pathogenicity. it is mediated by a 70-kilobase plasmid called pyv. the structural genes of the yops (yop genes), as well as genes involved in the control of their expression (vir genes), have been localized on pyv. in this communication we show that virf encodes a transcriptional activator controlling the yop regulon. this activator is a 30,879-dalton protein related to arac, the regulator of the escherichia coli and  salmonella typhimurium arabinose operons. we also show in this paper that transcription of virf is thermodependent and presumably autoregulated. virf is thus responsible for the effect of temperature on the production of the yops. finally, we show that virf activates transcription of the yop genes independently of the presence of calcium ions. the role of calcium therefore remains unaccounted for.

TI  == the ail locus is found uniquely in yersinia enterocolitica serotypes commonly associated with disease.
AB  == yersinia enterocolitica is a heterogeneous group of organisms with more than 50 serotypes and several biotypes. only a few of these serotypes cause gastrointestinal disease in otherwise healthy hosts; these serotypes are the pathogenic serotypes. although y. enterocolitica requires a high-molecular-weight plasmid to cause disease, chromosome-encoded determinants are required for the full expression of virulence. the ability of yersinia spp. to invade eucaryotic cells is thought to be a virulence factor, because nonpathogenic serotypes are noninvasive in animals and in tissue culture cell models. current evidence indicates that invasion ability is chromosome encoded. we recently reported cloning two loci, inv and ail, from y. enterocolitica o8 strain 8081c that allow  escherichia coli to invade tissue culture cells. we investigated the link between invasion in an in vitro tissue culture invasion (tci) model and hybridization to  probes derived from the two invasion loci, inv and ail. we examined 177 yersinia  strains. strains of serotypes and species associated with disease were tci+, whereas strains of serotypes and species not associated with disease were tci-. only tci+ strains had dna homologous to probes derived from ail. all strains (tci+ and tci-) had dna homologous to probes derived from inv, but there were certain restriction fragment-linked polymorphisms that were associated primarily  with tci+ strains. these observations held true for strains epidemiologically associated with disease. both the inv and ail loci were found to be clearly located on the chromosome. no other genera, including other invasive organisms, had dna homologous to inv or ail. these data support the hypothesis that the ail  locus encodes a y. enterocolitica invasion factor that may be involved in pathogenesis.

TI  == survival of coliforms and bacterial pathogens within protozoa during chlorination.
AB  == the susceptibility of coliform bacteria and bacterial pathogens to free chlorine  residuals was determined before and after incubation with amoebae and ciliate protozoa. viability of bacteria was quantified to determine their resistance to free chlorine residuals when ingested by laboratory strains of acanthamoeba castellanii and tetrahymena pyriformis. cocultures of bacteria and protozoa were  incubated to facilitate ingestion of the bacteria and then were chlorinated, neutralized, and sonicated to release intracellular bacteria. qualitative susceptibility of protozoan strains to free chlorine was also assessed. protozoa  were shown to survive and grow after exposure to levels of free chlorine residuals that killed free-living bacteria. ingested coliforms escherichia coli,  citrobacter freundii, enterobacter agglomerans, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella  pneumoniae, and klebsiella oxytoca and bacterial pathogens salmonella typhimurium, yersinia enterocolitica, shigella sonnei, legionella gormanii, and campylobacter jejuni had increased resistance to free chlorine residuals. bacteria could be cultured from within treated protozoans well after the time required for 99% inactivation of free-living cells. all bacterial pathogens were  greater than 50-fold more resistant to free chlorine when ingested by t. pyriformis. escherichia coli ingested by a cyclidium sp., a ciliate isolated from a drinking water reservoir, were also shown to be more resistant to free chlorine. the mechanism that increased resistance appeared to be survival within  protozoan cells. this study indicates that bacteria can survive ingestion by protozoa. this bacterium-protozoan association provides bacteria with increased resistance to free chlorine residuals which can lead to persistence of bacteria in chlorine-treated water. we propose that resistance to digestion by predatory protozoa was an evolutionary precursor of pathogenicity in bacteria and that today it is a mechanism for survival of fastidious bacteria in dilute and inhospitable aquatic environments.

TI  == analysis of the class-specific immune response to yersinia enterocolitica virulence-associated antigens in oro-gastrically infected rabbits.

TI  == evidence for two genetic loci in yersinia enterocolitica that can promote invasion of epithelial cells.
AB  == virulent strains of yersinia enterocolitica cause disease syndromes ranging from  mild gastroenteritis to lymphadenitis and septicemia. the ability of these bacteria to invade intestinal epithelial cells to gain access to the reticuloendothelial system is thought to be an important aspect of their virulence. we report here on the cloning of two y. enterocolitica chromosomal loci, inv and ail, each of which confers an invasive phenotype on escherichia coli hb101. the inv locus allows a uniformly high level of invasion in several tissue culture lines and is homologous to the inv gene of yersinia pseudotuberculosis. the second locus, ail, shows more host specificity than inv in that it allows invasion to a variable degree of some cell lines (e.g., hep-2,  hec1b, and cho cells) but allows no invasion of others (e.g., madin-darby canine  kidney cells).

AB  == on the basis of the published nucleotide sequences of the genes that code for the heat-labile toxin lth and the heat-stable toxins stai and staii of human enterotoxigenic escherichia coli, a 34-mer and two 33-mer oligonucleotide probes  were synthesized. to compare their relative efficacies in the detection and differentiation of enterotoxigenic e. coli, a colony hybridization technique using these probes and a gm1 ganglioside enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using  monoclonal anti-lt and anti-st antibodies were used with 76 strains of e. coli with known enterotoxin profiles. for further evaluation of probe specificity, the enterotoxigenic bacteria vibrio cholerae o1 and non-o1 and yersinia enterocolitica were examined with the colony hybridization technique. the sensitivity of colony hybridization compared favorably with that of gm1 ganglioside enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and the two assays showed a high level of concordance in specific detection and differentiation of e. coli with various enterotoxin profiles (kappa = 0.906, p less than 0.00001). the probes did not hybridize with dnas from strains of v. cholerae o1 or non-o1 or y. enterocolitica.

TI  == characterization of monoclonal antibodies to protein antigen of salmonella typhi.
AB  == two monoclonal antibodies were produced against protein antigens of salmonella typhi. one of the antibodies (stp14) belongs to the immunoglobulin g1k subclass,  and the other (stp13) was assigned to the immunoglobulin g2a(kappa) subclass. both antibodies could recognize the 34.0-kilodalton protein antigen from s. typhi. the specificity of these antibodies was tested by immunoblotting with a panel of crude protein antigens from 12 bacteria causing enteric fever and enteric fever-like illness: s. typhi, s. paratyphi a, s. paratyphi b, s. paratyphi c, s. choleraesuis, s. enteritidis, s. krefeld, s. panama, s. typhimurium, escherichia coli, pseudomonas pseudomallei, and yersinia enterocolitica. in a modified double-antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay they could detect the protein antigen at ca. 0.6 microgram/ml. these monoclonal antibodies should be of great value in the diagnostic test for detecting s. typhi antigen in samples of bodily fluids isolated from patients with typhoid fever and in studies of the chemical structure and other immunological properties of this 34.0-kilodalton protein.

TI  == enteropathogens associated with acute infantile diarrhoea in cape town.
AB  == the results of a year-long controlled study on the causation of acute infectious  diarrhoea in infants are reported. campylobacter fetus subspecies jejuni, rotavirus and certain enteropathogenic escherichia coli (epec) types were identified as the most common enteropathogens. shigella, salmonella group b and yersinia enterocolitica were significant but less common pathogens. campylobacter, rotavirus, the significant epec types and shigella infections were more frequent in the warm summer and autumn months. this only partially accounts  for the marked summer peak of diarrhoea, since at this time the percentage of cases of undetermined causation is highest (61%). over the year an identifiable cause of the diarrhoea was found in 49% of the patients studied. a specific epec  type, 0126:k71(b16), appeared to vary in pathogenicity on a seasonal basis. multiple enteropathogens occurred relatively frequently.

TI  == tigemonam, an oral monobactam.
AB  == tigemonam is an orally administered monobactam. at less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml it inhibited the majority of strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter diversus, proteus spp., providencia spp., aeromonas hydrophila, salmonella spp., shigella spp., serratia marcescens,  and yersinia enterocolitica. at less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml it inhibited haemophilus spp., neisseria spp., and branhamella catarrhalis. it did not inhibit pseudomonas spp. or acinetobacter spp. tigemonam was more active than cephalexin and amoxicillin-clavulanate and inhibited many members of the family enterobacteriaceae resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and gentamicin. some enterobacter cloacae and citrobacter freundii strains resistant to aminothiazole iminomethoxy cephalosporins and aztreonam were resistant to tigemonam. the mic for 90% of hemolytic streptococci of groups a, b, and c and for streptococcus pneumoniae was 16 micrograms/ml, but the mic for 90% of enterococci, listeria spp., bacteroides spp., and viridans group streptococci was greater than 64 micrograms/ml. tigemonam was not hydrolyzed by the common plasmid beta-lactamases such as tem-1 and shv-1 or by the chromosomal beta-lactamases of  enterobacter, morganella, pseudomonas, and bacteroides spp. tigemonam inhibited beta-lactamases of e. cloacae and pseudomonas aeruginosa but did not induce beta-lactamases. the growth medium had a minimal effect on the in vitro activity  of tigemonam, and there was a close agreement between the mics and mbcs.

AB  == the effect of synthetic iron chelators of the 1-alkyl-3-hydroxy-2-methylpyrid-4-one class (the l1 series) and 1-hydroxypyrid-2-one (l4) on bacterial growth in human serum was compared with those of the plant iron chelators mimosine and maltol and of the microbial siderophore desferrioxamine. none of the synthetic chelators enhanced growth of 3 gram-negative organisms (yersinia enterocolitica, escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa); in some cases they were even inhibitory. l4 strongly stimulated growth of staphylococcus epidermidis, but the l1 series had only a marginal effect. maltol was mildly inhibitory to all 4 bacterial species, while mimosine enhanced the growth of s. epidermidis and y. enterocolitica but had little effect on e. coli or p. aeruginosa. desferrioxamine enhanced the growth of all except e. coli. these results suggest that the chelators of synthetic or plant origin may carry less risk of increasing susceptibility to bacterial infection in patients undergoing chelation therapy for iron overload than does desferrioxamine, the drug currently in clinical use.

AB  == azithromycin (cp-62,993 [9-deoxy-9a-methyl-9a-aza-9a-homoerythromycin]) is a novel macrolide antimicrobial. in this study the in vitro activity of cp-62,993 has been determined against selected enteropathogens, including clostridium difficile, and compared with that of erythromycin. mics were determined using an  agar incorporation technique in mueller-hinton medium, containing saponin-lysed horse blood at a final concentration of 10% v/v, with an inoculum of 10(4) cfu. cp-62,993 was considerably more active than erythromycin against salmonella typhi (mic90 4 and greater than 32 mg/l, respectively), s. enteritidis (mic90 4 and greater than 32 mg/l), shigella flexneri (mic90 2 and 32 mg/l), sh. dysenteriae (mic90 2 and 32 mg/l), sh. sonnei (mic90 4 and 32 mg/l), campylobacter jejuni (mic90 0.12 and 1 mg/l), vibrio cholerae (mic90 0.25 and 8 mg/l), v. parahaemolyticus (mic90 0.5 and 8 mg/l), yersinia enterocolitica (mic90 4 and greater than 32 mg/l), escherichia coli-etec (mic90 4 and 32 mg/l), e. coli-eiec  (mic90 4 and greater than 32 mg/l), plesiomonas shigelloides (mic90 1 and 8 mg/l) and aeromonas hydrophila (mic90 4 and 32 mg/l). cp-62,993 (mic90 2 mg/l) was slightly less active than erythromycin (mic90 1 mg/l) against isolates of c. difficile. the results suggest a potential clinical role for cp-62,993 in the treatment of enteric infections where antimicrobial therapy is indicated.

TI  == outer membrane proteins of yersinia: major protein induced by maltose.
AB  == the composition of outer membrane (om) proteins of y. enterocolitica, y. intermedia, y. frederiksenii and y. kristensenii was investigated. pomp proteins  were described from y. enterocolitica and y. intermedia. in all the studied bacteria the presence of two to four major proteins, that is yomp-c, yomp-f, yomp-a and protein with molecular weight 47 kda was demonstrated. the position of 47 kda protein on polyacrylamide gel (sds-page) corresponds to maltoporins in escherichia coli. this protein may be induced by the addition of maltose to the medium, and in the case of y. intermedia also maltodextrins. the amount of 47 kda protein in the om of all the examined strains does not change after addition of ca++ ions, it increases, however, under conditions of increased osmolarity. y. enterocolitica is an exception since its synthesis of the above mentioned protein is independent on the medium osmolarity.

TI  == comparison of the ability of enteroinvasive escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, yersinia pseudotuberculosis, and yersinia enterocolitica to enter and replicate within hep-2 cells.
AB  == salmonella typhimurium, enteroinvasive escherichia coli, yersinia pseudotuberculosis, and yersinia enterocolitica possess the ability to enter intestinal epithelial cells. we used a quantitative tissue culture model employing hep-2 cells to compare the abilities of these bacteria to enter epithelial cells. s. typhimurium and yersinia species were highly infective for hep-2 cells but were unable to replicate extensively intracellularly. enteroinvasive e. coli exhibited low infectivity but replicated extensively intracellularly. the growth of enteroinvasive e. coli led to destruction of the hep-2 monolayer, whereas yersinia spp. and s. typhimurium were maintained intracellularly for prolonged periods without damage to the monolayer. the ability of enteroinvasive e. coli to enter hep-2 cells required prior growth at 37 degrees c; neither s. typhimurium nor yersinia spp. exhibited this temperature dependence for cell entry. an e. coli k-12 derivative containing a 230-kilobase plasmid from enteroinvasive e. coli was constructed. this derivative shared all the invasive characteristics of the parental enteroinvasive strain, suggesting that determinants required for cell entry and intracellular multiplication were at least partially plasmid encoded. an hb101 derivative containing a cloned invasion determinant from y. pseudotuberculosis was constructed in our laboratory. hep-2 monolayers were coinfected with these two k-12 derivatives to compare invasion determinants from enteroinvasive e. coli with those of y. pseudotuberculosis in a common genetic background. results from these experiments suggest that these organisms reside within separate intracellular compartments.

TI  == lipopolysaccharide induces recurrence of arthritis in rat joints previously injured by peptidoglycan-polysaccharide.
AB  == rat ankle joints injected intraarticularly with 5 micrograms of group a streptococcal peptidoglycan-polysaccharide (pg-aps) developed an acute course of  arthritis. recurrence of arthritis was induced in 100% of these joints by intravenous injection of as little as 10 micrograms of salmonella typhimurium lipopolysaccharide (lps) 3 wk after intraarticular injection. this reaction was similar in athymic and euthymic rats. buffalo rats were less susceptible than lewis or sprague-dawley rats. neisseria gonorrhoeae, yersinia enterocolitica, and escherichia coli lps, and s. typhimurium re mutant lps, were also active. re mutant lps activity was greatly reduced by mixing with polymyxin b. e. coli lipid a was weakly active. an acute synovitis of much less incidence, severity, and duration was seen in contralateral joints injected initially with saline, and in  ankle joints of naive, previously uninjected rats after intravenous lps injection. the intravenous injection of the muramidase mutanolysin on day 0 or 7  after intraarticular pg-aps injection prevented lps-induced recurrence of arthritis. these studies suggest that the phlogistic activities of lipid a and peptidoglycan might interact in an inflammatory disease process, and that lps may play a role in recurrent episodes of rheumatoid arthritis or reactive arthritis.

TI  == plasmid-mediated resistance to phagocytosis in yersinia enterocolitica.
AB  == results of our previous studies have shown that the chemiluminescence response of human neutrophils (polymorphonuclear leukocytes [pmns]) is inhibited by plasmid-mediated cell surface components from yersinia enterocolitica. in this study we examined the susceptibility to phagocytosis of y. enterocolitica cells with or without plasmid-mediated surface structure and the effect of isolated outer membrane fragments on phagocytosis of escherichia coli by pmns in vitro. y. enterocolitica cells with expressed plasmid-mediated surface structure were much  less sensitive to ingestion by pmns than those without it, and the resistance to  phagocytosis was readily eliminated in a dose-dependent fashion by pronase treatment of whole cells, which was shown to remove plasmid-encoded outer membrane proteins. ingestion and intracellular killing of e. coli were inhibited  significantly in the presence of isolated outer membrane fragments derived from plasmid-bearing y. enterocolitica cells. to assess the interaction of y. enterocolitica with phagocytic cells in vivo, two isogenic strains of y. enterocolitica, differing only in the presence or absence of the virulence plasmid, were inoculated intradermally into the backs of rabbits; and tissue sections obtained at 12 h postinoculation were examined by light and electron microscopy. the plasmidless strain was found almost entirely in pmns or mononuclear cells. in contrast, the plasmid-bearing strain was found to be surrounded by, or interspersed with, pmns and mononuclear cells; but most bacteria were extracellular, with little evidence of phagocytosis. these results  suggest that plasmid-mediated cell surface components of y. enterocolitica act as antiphagocytic factors, thus facilitating the survival and proliferation of the organism in the host tissue.

AB  == b0-1165 is a 1-carboxy-1-cyclopropoxyamino,4-fluoromethyl monobactam. it inhibited the majority of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, citrobacter diversus, aeromonas hydrophila, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, providencia rettgeri, providencia stuartii, yersinia enterocolitica, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and salmonella and shigella species at less than or equal to 0.125 microgram/ml. overall, its in vitro activity was similar to that of aztreonam, cefotaxime, and ceftazidime, with minor differences in the mics for individual isolates. enterobacter species and citrobacter freundii which were derepressed for beta-lactamase production and had higher mics of aztreonam and ceftazidime had mics that ranged from 4 to 32 micrograms/ml. b0-1165 had activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa similar to that of aztreonam but lower than that of ceftazidime and carumonam. pseudomonas maltophilia and other pseudomonas species were resistant or had mics of 32 micrograms/ml, as did acinetobacter species. b0-1165 did not inhibit streptococcal, staphylococcal, or anaerobic species, such as clostridium and bacteroides species. b0-1165 was not hydrolyzed to any appreciable extent by common plasmid- and chromosomally richmond-sykes type 1a-, 1c-, and 1d-mediated beta-lactamases. it inhibited the enterobacter cloacae p99 and inducible pseudomonas aeruginosa beta-lactamases. b0-1165 was a poor inducer of beta-lactamase, but exposing e. cloacae and c. freundii to b0-1165 selected for resistant isolates. overall, b0-1165 had in vitro properties similar to those of  other monobactams currently available or under investigation.

AB  == interactions between representative strains of four predominant resident bacteria of the human colon, escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, bacteroides ovatus,  and fusobacterium varium, and strains of seven enteropathogens, yersinia enterocolitica, shigella flexneri, salmonella typhimurium, vibrio parahaemolyticus, v. cholerae serogroup non o1, staphylococcus aureus, and clostridium perfringens, were examined in studies with an anaerobic continuous flow culture system and medium resembling the content of the mouse caecum (mcm).  potent unilateral antagonism attributable to synergic activities of the resident  bacteria against the enteropathogens was evident. the four resident bacteria persisted at levels of c. 10(6) cfu/ml or more in single and in any mixed cultures of the resident species. the seven enteropathogens also persisted in single cultures. in contrast, y. enterocolitica was excluded in several days in mixed cultures with each of the four resident bacteria. sh. flexneri and staph. aureus were excluded in the presence of e. coli alone. c. perfringens, v. parahaemolyticus and v. cholerae serogroup non o1 were excluded in the presence of e. coli with b. ovatus and, in some cases, with additional species. s. typhimurium was the most resistant; only c. 10(2)-fold reduction of the population level was observed in mixed culture with all four of the resident species. when the amounts of some components in the medium, such as peptone and yeast extract, were increased, c. perfringens grew and persisted even in the presence of the four resident bacteria. sh. flexneri, in contrast decreased steadily, even in enriched media.

TI  == health significance and occurrence of injured bacteria in drinking water.
AB  == enteropathogenic and indicator bacteria become injured in drinking water with exposure to sublethal levels of various biological, chemical and physical factors. one manifestation of this injury is the inability to grow and form colonies on selective media containing surfactants. the resulting underestimation of indicator bacteria can lead to a false estimation of water potability. m-t7 medium was developed specifically for the recovery of injured coliforms (both "total" and fecal) in drinking water. the m-t7 method was used to survey operating drinking water treatment and distribution systems for the presence of injured coliforms that were undetected with currently used media. the mean recovery with m-endo les medium was less than 1/100 ml while it ranged between 6  and 68/100ml with m-t7 agar. the majority of samples giving positive results with m-t7 medium yielded no detectable coliforms with m-endo les agar. over 95% of the coliform bacteria in these samples were injured. laboratory experiments were also done to ascribe the virulence of injured waterborne pathogens. enteropathogens including salmonella typhimurium, yersinia enterocolitica and shigella spp. required up to 20 times the chlorine levels to produce the same injury in enterotoxigenic escherichia coli (etec) and nonpathogenic coliforms. similar results were seen with y. enterocolitica exposed to copper. the recovery of etec  was followed by delayed enterotoxin production, both in vitro and in the gut of experimental animals. this indicates that injured waterborne enteropathogenic bacteria can be virulent.

TI  == serum iga to enterobacteria in ankylosing spondylitis.
AB  == the aetiology of ankylosing spondylitis (as) may involve certain enterobacteria.  it is therefore interesting that serum polymeric iga, a precursor of secretory iga, was statistically elevated in active as (n = 35) and that levels were comparable to those found in yersiniosis (n = 12); this might indicate antigenic  stimulation by bacteria which are present in the intestines of as patients. however, specific serum iga to the incriminated enterobacteria klebsiella, shigella and yersinia, as determined by elisa, was not raised in the above as patients. nor were these titres raised in patients with idiopathic reactive arthritis (n = 21). in contrast, yersiniosis (n = 12) and shigellosis (n = 96) patients displayed marked increases in specific serum iga titres to the respective infectants. it is proposed that as may involve a set of enterobacteria rather than a few suspected species. thus, despite the lack of raised group averages, screening of individual patients for specific iga to several indicated  bacteria might disclose whether or not raised serum iga is related to enterobacterial activity. apart from this, the above supports other reports indicating that serum iga may be a useful parameter to assist in monitoring of disease activity in as. finally, it is suggested that study of a homogeneous group of reactive arthritis patients might facilitate aetiological research of seronegative arthropathies such as as.

TI  == bacterial diarrhoea.
AB  == bacterial infections are important causes of diarrhoea in infants and children, particularly in developing countries and in other settings where standards of personal and community hygiene are low. knowledge of bacterial diarrhoeas has been significantly expanded in recent years by the finding that many episodes of  acute diarrhoea are due to infections with bacteria which produce enterotoxins that interfere with intestinal fluid and electrolyte transport (the 'enterotoxigenic' diarrhoeas). several 'newer' bacterial agents have also been identified which would not have been detected in earlier studies of the epidemiology of infective diarrhoeas; these include aeromonas, campylobacter, clostridium difficile and yersinia. another important advance has been new knowledge about mechanisms by which bacteria cause diarrhoea; this has led to the widespread successful application of oral rehydration therapy in treatment of acute watery diarrhoeas.

AB  == the presence of various enteropathogens was examined in the feces of homebred dairy calves reared in a restricted geographical area of france (north west of county of indre-et-loire) during winter 1983-1984. two distinct surveys were carried on: a case-control study including 32 diarrheic calves and 21 healthy calves bred in 53 different farms; and a separate study on nine diarrheic calves  in another farm. the following infectious agents were looked for, by specific methods of detection: escherichia coli k99 and e. coli lethal for mice, salmonella species, yersinia enterocolitica, campylobacter jejuni, enterotoxigenic clostridium perfringens, chlamydia psittaci, rotaviruses, coronaviruses, cryptosporidium. in the case-control survey, no enterotoxigenic e. coli (k99+) was detected in either group of calves. four agents were more often detected in diarrheic calves than in healthy calves, i.e. rotavirus (12/32 vs 1/21), lethal e. coli (6/32 vs 1/21), cryptosporidium (2/32 vs 0/21) and salmonella typhimurium (1/32 vs 0/21). one at least of these four agents was present in 16 diarrheic calves (50%) vs only 2 healthy calves (10%) (p less than  0.01). on the other hand, the occurrence of campylobacter jejuni and of c. perfringens, enterotoxin was similar in both groups of calves, accounting respectively for about 20% and 10% of total calves. moreover, coronavirus-like particles were significatively associated with healthy calves (7/32 vs 11/21; p less than 0.05). in the other study, all the main categories of enteropathogens were detected throughout the period of observation in the same farm with the exception of enterotoxigenic e. coli. but each calf taken individually was rarely shedding more than two agents at a time. in addition, specific antibodies against c. perfringens enterotoxin, as tested in an elisa test, were present in the serum of all the calves examined in both surveys. this study confirms the primary role  of rotavirus and cryptosporidium as agents of diarrhea in calves under three weeks. it also suggests the possible participation of e. coli strains that are lethal for mice and underlines the potential hazard for human health of bovine reservoirs of campylobacter jejuni and enterotoxigenic c. perfringens.

AB  == three enteric pathogens yersinia enterocolitica o:8, salmonella typhimurium, and  enterotoxigenic escherichia coli, were examined for their ability to colonize granular activated carbon (gac) in pure cultures and in the presence of autochthonous river water organisms. all three organisms readily colonized sterile gac and maintained populations of ca. 10(5) to 10(7) cfu g-1 for 14 days  when suspended in sterile river water. exposure of pathogen biofilms on gac to unsterile river water resulted in a gradual decline in pathogens on the carbon (0.08 to 0.14 log day-1). when pathogens were introduced to sterile gac in the presence of heterotrophic plate count organisms, they attached at levels similar  to those in the pure cultures and then decreased (0.10 to 0.22 log day-1). when added with heterotrophic plate count bacteria to gac supporting a mature biofilm  of native river water bacteria, they attached at a lower level (1.0 x 10(4) to 4.6 x 10(4) cfu g-1) and decreased at a more rapid rate (0.11 to 0.70 log day-1).

AB  == the antibacterial effects produced by ticarcillin disodium plus clavulanate potassium, a combination of the broad-spectrum penicillin ticarcillin, and the beta-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid as the potassium salt, have been measured in vitro and in experimental infection studies. the presence of clavulanic acid resulted in a significant enhancement of the activity of ticarcillin against a wide range of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria. these included ticarcillin-resistant strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, p. vulgaris, yersinia enterocolitica, and the anaerobe bacteroides fragilis. in addition, beta-lactamase-producing isolates of  hemophilus influenzae, branhamella catarrhalis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and staphylococcus aureus were susceptible to ticarcillin and clavulanate. clavulanic acid did not influence the activity of ticarcillin against ticarcillin-susceptible bacteria. the bactericidal effects of the antibiotic combination were measured in an in vitro kinetic model in which the drug concentrations were varied to simulate those measured in humans after intravenous dosing with ticarcillin (3.0 g) and clavulanate potassium (100 mg clavulanic acid). in these tests, ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid had pronounced bactericidal activity against ticarcillin-resistant bacteria. the protection of ticarcillin by clavulanic acid from inactivation by bacterial beta-lactamases in  vivo was demonstrated in experimental infection models in which the efficacy of the ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid combination against infections caused by beta-lactamase-producing bacteria was correlated with the presence of effective concentrations of both antibiotic and inhibitor at the site of infection.

TI  == [epidemiology, etiology and laboratory diagnosis of infectious diarrhea diseases  in the tropics].
AB  == diarrhoeal diseases belong to the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in tropical countries, especially in infants and small children. about one billion episodes are estimated for this group of age with 4.6 million fatalities. many causes are discussed to explain the high incidence: bottle feeding of infants, protein malnutrition, unsafe drinking water and unsafe disposal of excrements and sewage, unsufficient consciousness of personal and domestic hygiene, lack of knowledge on the origin of disease, and inadequate food hygiene. among the viral  infectious agents rotavirus is isolated from 30-40% of enteritis cases in infants and small children; norwalk virus, adenovirus and human calicivirus, too, appear  to occur worldwide. enteropathogenic (epec) and, especially, enterotoxigenic escherichia coli (etec) are of primary importance as bacterial pathogens. campylobacter jejuni and c. coli primarily cause disease in infants and small children. shigellae are important whereas salmonellae are less frequently identified as a cause for diarrhoeal illness. yersinia enterocolitica is rare in  tropical countries. cholera and infections with other vibrionaceae (v. cholerae non-01, v. mimicus, v. parahaemolyticus, aeromonas, plesiomonas shigelloides) mainly occur in coastal areas. clostridium perfringens type c is the causal agent of enteritis necroticans in several countries, especially new guinea. c. difficile appears to be of minor importance. among the parasites giardia lamblia  and entamoeba histolytica are the most important organisms causing diarrhoeal disease. macroscopic (visible blood) and microscopic stool examination (faecal leukocytes) may be helpful in dysenteric disease to distinguish between shigella  and e. histolytica infections; it is, however, of limited usefulness to discriminate between organisms causing watery diarrhoea.

AB  == five heat-stable enterotoxins were isolated from the culture supernatant of yersinia enterocolitica and purified to homogeneity by deae-sephacel and high-performance liquid chromatographies. they caused acute fluid accumulation in the intestine of suckling mice. the amino acid sequence of one of the enterotoxins was determined to be ser-ser-asp-trp-asp-cys-cys-asp-val-cys-cys-asn-pro-ala-cys-ala-gly-cys, by edman degradation of its pyridylethylated derivative and a combination of fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry and carboxypeptidase b digestion. this structure was unambiguously confirmed by chemical synthesis. the other enterotoxins had longer or shorter amino acid sequences at their n termini, but the same sequence  at their c termini. the six half-cystine residues formed intramolecular disulfide linkages, as shown by measurement of the molecular masses of the enterotoxins by  fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry. the sequence of 13 amino acid residues at the c terminus showed similarity to those of heat-stable enterotoxins isolated from enterotoxigenic escherichia coli [aimoto, s. et al. (1982) eur. j. biochem.  129, 257-263; takao, t. et al. (1983) febs lett. 152, 1-5] suggesting that these  similar sequences are related to the common biological and immunological properties of enterotoxins produced by y. enterocolitica and enterotoxigenic e. coli.

TI  == changes in virulence of waterborne enteropathogens with chlorine injury.
AB  == we designed experiments to assess the effect of chlorine injury on the virulence  of waterborne enteropathogens. higher chlorine doses (0.9 to 1.5 mg/liter) were necessary to produce injured yersinia enterocolitica, salmonella typhimurium, and shigella spp. than to produce injured enterotoxigenic escherichia coli or coliform bacteria (0.25 to 0.5 mg/liter) in the test system used; 50% lethal dose experiments in which mice were used showed that injured y. enterocolitica cells were 20 times less virulent than uninjured control cells (3,300 and 160 cfu, respectively). this decrease in virulence was not related to reduced attachment to henle 407 intestinal epithelial cells, but could be related to a loss of hela  cell invasiveness. in contrast, injured s. typhimurium and enterotoxigenic e. coli cells lost their ability to attach to henle cells. these data show that some enteropathogens and coliform bacteria differ in their sensitivities to chlorine injury and that the virulence determinants affected by chlorine may vary from one pathogen to another.

AB  == the outer membranes of gram-negative bacteria are considered to be of importance  in host-bacteria interaction, in protective immunity, and occasionally in subclassification within a species. in this study, the outer membranes of several strains of yersinia enterocolitica and y. pseudotuberculosis were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page). it was found that the appearance of the major proteins depended on the temperature at which they were solubilized in sds. a protein was identified with the use of two-dimensional gels and preparative sds-page, which was equivalent to the "heat-modifiable protein" (protein ii) of other enterobacteriaceae species. a monoclonal antibody, 4g1, was generated against an isolated preparation of this y. enterocolitica protein. this antibody was tested with whole cell bacterial antigens of 46 individual bacterial strains. the reactive strains included only y. enterocolitica and y. pseudotuberculosis. in addition, the reactivity of the 4g1 monoclonal antibody preparation could be absorbed only with y. enterocolitica and y. pseudotuberculosis, and not with other strains of bacteria. the reactivity of this 4g1 monoclonal antibody was also tested by the western blot technique. six individual strains were tested: a y. enterocolitica serotype 0:3, a y. enterocolitica serotype 0:9, an escherichia coli, a salmonella typhimurium, a shigella flexneri, and a klebsiella pneumoniae. the 4g1 antibody reacted with only the proteins of the two y. enterocolitica strains. in conclusion, the equivalent of the heat-modifiable protein was present in y. enterocolitica and y. pseudotuberculosis. moreover, this protein also carried a species-specific antigenic determinant.

AB  == enteropathogenic strains of yersinia enterocolitica harbor a virulence plasmid (70 kilobases) which specifies, at 37 degrees c, a calcium requirement for growth, autoagglutinability, resistance to the bactericidal activity of human serum, and the expression of some outer membrane proteins (omps). to map the genes encoding these properties, the virulence plasmid of a serogroup 9 strain (w22708) was subjected to transposon mutagenesis. a set of 68 independent mutations was obtained in escherichia coli by transposon tn813 (a tnpr mutant of  tn21)-mediated cointegration with the self-transmissible r388 plasmid. the resulting cointegrates were introduced and studied in y. enterocolitica w22708. one mutant lost the calcium dependence property. two other mutants presented a peculiar phenotype: they grew poorly at 37 degrees c, especially in the presence  of calcium. lastly, two mutants were affected in the properties of autoagglutination and resistance to human serum. analysis of the omp pattern of these two mutants revealed the absence of the largest omp, called p1 (i. bolin, and h. wolf-watz, infect. immun. 43:72-78, 1984). complementation of one of these mutations with the cloned structural gene of omp p1 restored the wild-type phenotype. however, omp p1 was not sufficient by itself to specify the serum resistance property and a rapid autoagglutination of the host.

AB  == stool cultures of 188 children hospitalized for gastroenteritis in a two-year period (1981-1982) yielded salmonella in 25.5%, campylobacter in 16.0%, and y. enterocolitica in 3.7% of cases. rotavirus was identified in 22.3% of cases. out  of 82 lactose-positive microorganisms isolated from as many cases, three (one e.  coli and two klebsiella) produced heat-labile enterotoxin and two e. coli strains a "cytotoxic" toxin (in an hep-2 in vitro model); two other e. coli strains possessed adhesive properties for hep-2 cells in vitro; none revealed enteroinvasive for hep-2 cells. two out of 70 e. coli strains were epec. from stools of 643 childhood out-patients salmonella was isolated in 9.6% of cases; campylobacter and y. enterocolitica in 9.0% and in 0.6% of cases respectively. rotavirus was not looked for. shigella strains were not isolated. among 622 children without gastrointestinal symptoms, five (0.8%) excreted campylobacters and one (0.16%) salmonella. children of 18-24 months of age were significantly more often infected with campylobacter. gross blood in feces, body temperature greater than 38 degrees c, and peripheral leukocytosis were significantly more often associated with salmonella infection; vomiting and absence of blood in stools and of leukocytosis with rotavirus infection. other features were not significantly associated with the etiological agent of the illness. except for salmonella infections, the enteritis cases did not show any pronounced seasonal pattern.

TI  == [pathogenesis, clinical aspects and diagnosis of the most important enteric bacterial diseases in animals].
AB  == there are adhesive and invasive species among enteropathogenic bacteria for animals. most frequently isolated adhesive bacteria are enterotoxigenic e. coli (etec). salmonella, t. hyodysenteriae, m. paratuberculosis, y. enterocolitica, cl. perfringens and c. jejuni bacteria represent the most important invasive germs. the main clinical finding connected with bacterial enteritis is diarrhoea  resp. dysentery. evaluation of feces consistency, time of appearance and accompanying symptoms (e.g. fever, colic) allow a clinical suspective diagnosis,  however a definitive diagnosis must be based on the demonstration of the causative agent. in addition to known cultural, microscopic, biochemical and serological diagnostic methods, the demonstration of virulence factors (enterotoxin formation, adhesive pili) plays an important role in diagnosis of enteropathogenic bacteria.

TI  == toxins which activate guanylate cyclase: heat-stable enterotoxins.
AB  == certain enteropathogenic bacteria, including strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and yersinia enterocolitica, elicit their diarrhoeagenic effects by elaborating small molecular weight, heat-stable enterotoxins (sts). structural and functional characteristics indicate that st peptides are heterogeneous and two major subtypes, sta and stb, have been identified. molecules of sta, unlike those of stb, are methanol-soluble and elicit their pathogenic effects by activating host cell guanylate cyclase activity and thereby increasing tissue cyclic gmp content: this increase in cyclic gmp causes fluid secretion. sta binds to specific proteinaceous receptors on intestinal cells but  the nature of sta-receptor coupling to guanylate cyclase is poorly understood. the actions of sta, including binding to its receptor, activation of guanylate cyclase and stimulation of electrolyte transport, are rapid, reversible and tissue-specific. sta activates only particulate and not soluble guanylate cyclase. it alters the vmax but not the apparent km of this enzyme for mg-gtp or  mn-gtp. at concentrations above 0.5-1 mm, calcium inhibits the sta activation of  guanylate cyclase. the effects of calmodulin antagonists such as chlorpromazine on the activation of guanylate cyclase by sta are less clear. inhibitors of phospholipid and arachidonic acid cascade pathways interfere with both basal and  sta-stimulated guanylate cyclase. membrane integrity is essential for sta activation of guanylate cyclase and the sta-receptor complex may activate the enzyme by intramembrane protein-protein interactions and/or perturbations. interference with membrane phospholipid could alter such coupling.

AB  == the in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of mt-141 were compared with those of cefoxitin, cefmetazole, moxalactam, cefotaxime, and cefoperazone. the mics of mt-141 for 90% of bacterial isolates were lower than the reference drugs  against clinical isolates of campylobacter jejuni, clostridium difficile, and bacteroides fragilis, whereas against clinical isolates of other gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic bacteria, the mics of mt-141 were similar to or higher than those of the reference drugs. in contrast, the bactericidal activity  of mt-141 after 6- and 24-h exposures was superior to all of the reference drugs  against 9 to 10 of the 12 bacterial strains studied, including escherichia coli,  klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella enteritidis, indol-positive proteus species, serratia marcescens, yersinia enterocolitica, pseudomonas cepacia, and clostridium perfringens. in the treatment of systemic infections in mice, mt-141  was again superior against 9 of the 12 strains tested, showing a good correlation with the bactericidal activity. it was found that the 50% effective doses of the  six cephalosporins studied correlated better with the mbcs than with the mics. as the serum levels of mt-141 in mice after subcutaneous administration were similar to those of the reference drugs, it was concluded that the bactericidal activity  of mt-141 was a dominant factor in its in vivo activity.

TI  == prevalence of enteric pathogens in the feces of healthy beef calves.
AB  == fecal specimens from 136 healthy beef calves (1 day to 12 weeks of age) were examined for the presence of infectious agents known to cause enteric disease in  calves. the calves were selected from 22 herds in which all calves were free of clinically apparent enteric disease. salmonella sp, enterotoxigenic escherichia coli, cryptosporidium, and coronavirus were not detected in any of the calves. three calves were infected with rotavirus and 1 calf was infected with yersinia enterocolitica. campylobacter-like bacteria were isolated from 50 of 130 calves,  with 36 of the calves positive for c jejuni. seemingly, clinically normal calves  may be infected more often with enterotoxigenic e coli, cryptosporidium, coronavirus, or rotavirus in herds in which some calves have enteric disease than in herds free of major enteric disease. campylobacter jejuni was well adapted to  the bovine host and was of similar prevalence in diarrheal and nondiarrheal calves. the k99 positive, nonenterotoxigenic e coli was isolated from the feces of 16 healthy calves. information in addition to the presence of k99 antigen is useful when diagnosing enterotoxic colibacillosis in calves.

TI  == effect of chlorination on antibiotic resistance profiles of sewage-related bacteria.
AB  == a total of 1,900 lactose-fermenting bacteria were isolated from raw sewage influent and chlorinated sewage effluent from a sewage treatment plant, as well as from chlorinated and neutralized dilute sewage, before and after a 24-h regrowth period in the laboratory. of these isolates, 84% were resistant to one or more antibiotics. chlorination of influent resulted in an increase in the proportion of bacteria resistant to ampicillin and cephalothin, the increase being most marked after regrowth occurred following chlorination. of the other nine antibiotics tested, chlorination resulted in an increased proportion of bacteria resistant to some, but a decrease in the proportion resistant to the remainder. multiple resistance was found for up to nine antibiotics, especially in regrowth populations. identification of about 5% of the isolates showed that the highest proportion of escherichia coli fell in untreated sewage. some rare and potentially pathogenic species were isolated from chlorinated and regrowth samples, including yersinia enterocolitica, yersinia pestis, pasteurella multocida, and hafnia alvei. our results indicate that chlorination, while initially lowering the total number of bacteria in sewage, may substantially increase the proportions of antibiotic-resistant, potentially pathogenic organisms.

TI  == comparative study of the nature and biological activities of bacterial enterotoxins.
AB  == it is apparent that there are considerable similarities between many of the enterotoxins produced by enteric pathogens. although the effect of most of these  toxins is restricted to the intestine in vivo, many cells are also sensitive to intoxication in vitro. the resultant in-vitro biochemical changes may have no pathological significance but serve to underline the central role of cyclic nucleotides in cellular fluid regulation. the biological activity of these enterotoxins is the result of interaction with membrane-bound adenylate cyclase,  leading to persistent elevation of intracellular levels of camp. stimulation of adenylate cyclase occurs consistently after a characteristic lag phase which varies somewhat between toxins. the duration and degree of stimulation of adenylate cyclase by the various toxins may point to possible differences in affinity, dissociation and mechanism of activation of the cyclase molecule. subtle events at, or within, the cell membrane must occur during intoxication and may include complex associations of toxin with membrane lipid and protein components. the heat-labile toxins of v. cholerae, e. coli, salmonella spp., a. hydrophila and y. enterocolitica have much in common in their structures, membrane receptors and biochemical modes of action. similarly the heat-stable toxins of e. coli and y. enterocolitica, match each other in their biological activities. classified along with the enterotoxin of c. perfringens, the enterotoxin produced by sh. dysenteriae (and possibly some strains of e. coli) appears to differ from the other enterotoxins by acting on protein biosynthesis primarily and not on the nucleotide cyclase activation systems. in another category must be placed the various enterotoxins produced by staph. aureus until  more is known. surprisingly little research has been directed towards the elucidation of their mode of action, although much is known of their serological  and structural differences. evidence to date suggests that staphylococcal enterotoxins differ from the other diarrhoeagenic agents discussed in this review. the structural and immunological similarities between the various heat-labile enterotoxins suggest a common genetic origin with gene transfer between the different bacterial species being responsible for the spread of enterotoxigenicity. it is possible that many of the "newer" enterotoxins owe their origin to genetic recombination with the "older" enteropathogens like v. cholerae.

TI  == invasive enteric pathogens.
AB  == invasive enteric pathogens of the salmonella or shigella genera initiate infections by invading the intestinal epithelium. depending on the species, salmonellae either translocate across the mucosa of the small intestine and cause a systemic febrile disease or they evoke a localized inflammatory response in discreet areas of the infected mucosa. the latter type of infection is characterized by gastroenteritis, and a choleragen-like enterotoxin may contribute to the symptomology. shigellae can also evoke diarrheal episodes; however, classic shigellosis is characterized by localized invasion of the colonic epithelium, with inflammation and ulceration of the mucosa. derangement of the colonic mucosa is manifested in the bloody, mucoid stool characteristic of bacillary dysentery. genetic analysis of invasive enteric pathogens has shown that extrachromosomal elements (plasmids) are required for full expression of virulence in salmonella typhimurium, yersinia enterocolitica, shigella sonnei, and shigella flexneri. in the latter species, at least three chromosomal regions  are also necessary for virulence.

AB  == a systematic study of enteropathogenic agents in the stools of children was carried out in a rural area of kivu province in zaire in june, 1979. 84 inpatients and 271 outpatients with diarrhoea were investigated together with 117 inpatient and 203 outpatient controls without diarrhoea. campylobacter jejuni was the most frequently recovered pathogen in both inpatients (24%) and outpatients (13.7%). enterotoxigenic escherichia coli was the next most common among children presenting as outpatients with diarrhoea (10.3%). yersinia enterocolitica was isolated for the first time in this region. rotaviruses were found only in outpatients with diarrhoea, and usually in children under two years of age. c. jejuni and vibrio cholerae could also be isolated from the faeces of domestic animals living in close contact with these village families. analysis of the clinical features did not lead to the recognition of a pattern typical of any particular pathogen. salmonella, shigella, and enteropathogenic e. coli did not play a significant role in the cases studied.

TI  == recent advances in management of bacterial diarrhea.
AB  == the number of recognized infectious causes of diarrhea potentially treatable with specific antibiotics has markedly increased within the past ten years. laboratories are developing and expanding their abilities to deal with these new  pathogens. neither prophylaxis nor specific treatment of diarrhea in travelers is simple, practical, and safe. although enterotoxigenic escherichia coli is the most important cause of diarrhea in u.s. travelers to tropical areas, campylobacter jejuni causes acute diarrhea in persons in the united states about  as often as do salmonella and shigella. vibrio parahemolyticus is an important cause of outbreaks of gastroenteritis following ingestion of improperly cooked shellfish; bacillus cereus is important in outbreaks of diarrhea after ingestion  of improperly cooked and stored rice in chinese restaurants. although yersinia enterocolitica is probably an important cause of severe enteritis in the united states, imperfect techniques for its isolation and lack of good serologic tests have hampered recognition of its importance. practical means for diagnosing antibiotic-associated colitis and the role of clostridium difficile toxins in this disease are now available. vancomycin, metronidazole, bacitracin, and cholestyramine are useful in treatment of antibiotic-associated colitis.

TI  == enteropathogenic escherichia coli serotypes and endemic diarrhea in infants.
AB  == enteropathogenic escherichia coli serotypes were searched for in feces of 550 children with endemic diarrhea and in 129 controls, in sao paulo, in 1978 and 1979; serotypes o111ab:h(-), o111ab:h(2), and o119:h6 were significantly associated with diarrhea in children 0 to 5 months old and were the most frequent agents of diarrhea in this age group as compared with enterotoxigenic and enteroinvasive e. coli, salmonella sp., shigella sp., and yersinia enterocolitica. it is concluded that various enteropathogenic e. coli serotypes may be agents of endemic infantile diarrhea.

TI  == effect of yersinia enterocolitica st on cyclic guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate levels in mouse intestines and cultured cells.
AB  == we determined the effect of heat-stable enterotoxin produced by yersinia enterocolitica (y. enterocolitica st) on cyclic nucleotide levels in the intestines of 6-day-old mice and in cultured cell line cells. the concentration of cyclic guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic gmp) in homogenates of the intestines increased four- to fivefold by 3 min after intragastric administration of 10 units of purified y. enterocolitica st. this increase continued for 60 min, and then the concentration of cyclic gmp fell toward the levels of the controls.  on the other hand, fluid accumulation in the intestines was not evident until 60  min after administration of the toxin. thus, the increase in intestinal cyclic gmp concentration preceded measurable fluid accumulation. the effect on both cyclic gmp levels and fluid accumulation was abolished by treatment of the st with either alkali solution (ph 10.7) or 2-mercaptoethanol. likewise, cyclic gmp  levels in cultured cells (ccl-6, hela, l, and mm-1 cells) increased dose-dependently by 10 min after incubation of the cells with the st. cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate levels in both intestines and cultured cells were not affected by the toxin.

AB  == direct plating or cold enrichment or both have been used to isolate yersinia spp. from feces. freeze-shock double enrichment and koh treatment have been recommended for recovery of yersinia enterocolitica from surface waters and food, respectively. these techniques were evaluated as alternatives for rapid recovery  of yersinia spp. from feces. stool samples were homogenized in buffered saline and autoclaved. escherichia coli. klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were each added to the suspension at a final concentration of 1.5 x 10(6) colony-forming units per ml. yersinia cells were then added to a final concentration of 1.5 x 10(3), 1.5 x 10(4), 1.5 x 10(5), or 1.5 x 10(6) colony-forming units per ml. a total of 21 strains of y. enterocolitica, 2 of yersinia kristensenii, and 1 each of yersinia intermedia and yersinia fredriksenii were tested. for freeze-shock double enrichment, seeded stool samples were frozen overnight (-70 degrees c), transferred successively to m-tetrathionate broth (6 h. 37 degrees c) and selenite broth (2 h 37 degrees c),  and plated on macconkey, salmonella-shigella, and cellobiose-arginine-lysine agars for quantitation. for koh treatment, seeded stool samples were mixed with 0.5% koh at a ratio of 1:2 for 2 min and plated as described above. e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and p. aeruginosa were virtually eliminated after either method was used. all yersinia strains were recovered after koh treatment even at the lowest  initial concentration (1.5 x 10(3) colony-forming units per ml). however, after freeze-shock double enrichment, not all strains were retrievable, and those isolates which were recovered were grown only from samples containing the highest number of yersinia strains (1.5 x 10(6) colony-forming units per ml). koh treatment of stool samples seems to be a viable substitute for more protracted methods of recovering yersinia spp.

TI  == the pathogenicity of yersinia enterocolitica strains isolated from various sources in four test systems.
AB  == six tests were applied to 39 strains of yersinia enterocolitica of various serotypes and from several sources in an attempt to relate the test to pathogenicity of the strains. the tests that were used were the pig gut loop test and the infant mouse test for heat stable enterotoxin, the sereny and hela cell tests for invasiveness, inhibition of growth on magnesium oxalate agar, and the ability to cause diarrhea in infant mice. the pig gut loop test was found to be unsuitable for detection of heat stable enterotoxin but 20 strains produced heat  stable enterotoxin that was detected in infant mice. none of the strains was positive in the sereny test but 21 invaded hela cells. the growth of 20 strains was inhibited at 37 degrees c on magnesium oxalate agar and, in the orally-infected mice, 23 strains caused diarrhea or death. these findings indicate a discrepancy between the infant mouse test and the ligated intestine test in pigs for heat stable enterotoxin and a significant difference in y. enterocolitica heat stable enterotoxin compared with escherichia coli heat stable enterotoxin because the former failed to elicit a significant response in pig intestine.

AB  == twenty five strains of yersinia enterocolitica serogroup o3, were isolated from human enteritis and studied for heat-stable enterotoxin production. enterotoxin production was found even in the crude supernatant fluid of cultures that had been stored in stock agar for a year. according to the suckling mice and rabbit gut loop tests, after 1 to 5 years storage the filtrate showed heat-stable enterotoxin activity only in a purified and concentrated form. following more than 5 years storage positive results could be obtained only in rabbit gut loop test. after 9 years the freeze dried strains still showed a full capacity of heat-stable enterotoxin production. studies with concentrated substances showed that even after more than 9 years, there was no spontaneous loss of heat-stable enterotoxin production, only quantitative changes occurred. the methanol solubility of the heat-stable enterotoxin of y. enterocolitica is--as distinct from the heat-stable enterotoxin of escherichia coli--homogeneous and only the methanol soluble fractions showed any activity. the activity of methanol soluble  enterotoxin from several years old subcultures could be demonstrated in an isolated rabbit gut loop model even when it failed to show any activity in suckling mice.

AB  == rabbits were immunized with the enterobacterial common antigen (eca)-immunogenic  strain escherichia coli f470. eca-specific antiserum was obtained by absorbing the resulting antisera with the genetically closely related eca-negative strain e. coli f1283. these two strains also served as positive and negative controls in the localization study of eca in yersinia enterocolitica strain 75, smooth and rough forms (ye75s and ye75r), by the indirect immunoferritin technique. cells of ye75s grown at 22 degrees c showed no labeling with ferritin after treatment with the eca-specific antiserum and subsequent ferritin-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies. if the cells were grown at 40 degrees c, however, most of the cells showed weak ferritin labeling. at this higher growth temperature, the lipopolysaccharide of this strain contains less o-specific chains (6-deoxy-l-altrose), as was shown in a previous study. the rough mutant ye75r, which lacks o-specific chains completely, showed denser labeling with ferritin. these results indicate that eca on the cell surface of ye75s is covered by o-specific chains of the lipopolysaccharide if grown at 22 degrees c and is therefore not accessible to eca antibodies. it becomes accessible, however, when  o-chains are lacking (r mutants) or when they are reduced in size or amount (growth at 40 degrees c).

AB  == isocitrate lyase and malate synthase, the two unique enzymes of the glyoxylate cycle, were detected in crude extracts of yersinia pestis, y. pseudotuberculosis, and y. enterocolitica. y. pestis, unlike escherichia coli and the other yersiniae tested, yielded two forms of isocitrate lyase during growth on acetate. these forms differed in electrophoretic mobility and temperature optima. one form (a) was present during growth on acetate, but was absent during growth on alternate carbon sources such as glucose. the second form (b) was not constitutive, but was found during growth on acetate, glucose, xylose, or other complex carbon sources. itaconate, a succinate analog which inhibited both forms of isocitrate lyase in crude extracts, did not affect the growth of y. pestis under conditions where little isocitrate lyase activity was detected. this inhibitor, however, retarded  the growth of y. pestis under conditions where acetate was provided as the primary carbon and energy source as well as under all conditions in which either  form of isocitrate lyase was evident. this suggests that the b form may play an important role in the growth of this bacterium under conditions where a requirement for the classical anaplerotic sequence involving this enzyme is not apparent.

TI  == plasmid-mediated tissue invasiveness in yersinia enterocolitica.
AB  == plasmids have an important role in the pathogenicity of certain bacterial species, and escherichia coli provides the most complete example of the relationship involved. enterotoxigenic strains of e. coli, in addition to producing heat-stable and/or heat-labile enterotoxins, may also produce a haemolysin and fimbriate cell surface antigens which facilitate the adherence of  the bacterial cell to the mucosa of the small bowel. numerous studies have shown  that these properties are plasmid-mediated and that the plasmids act in concert to confer on the host bacterium the ability to produce enteric disease in man and in animals. moreover, studies with invasive strains of e. coli have shown that the col v plasmid, which codes for the synthesis of colicin v, significantly enhances the pathogenicity of its host bacterium. although the relationship between col v plasmids and virulence is unclear, reports indicate that col v-containing strains of e. coli are better able to survive in the alimentary tract and that colicine v itself inhibits macrophage function. it is probable that bacterial virulence is a complex phenomenon involving both chromosomal and plasmid genes. we describe here a virulence plasmid which mediates tissue invasiveness in human pathogenic strains of yersinia enterocolitica.

TI  == diffusion-in-gel enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (dig-elisa): optimal conditions for quantitation of antibodies.
AB  == in the diffusion-in-gel enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (dig-elisa) the quantitation of antibodies is based on their ability to form a diffusion gradient over an antigen-coated polystyrene surface. the antigen-antibody reaction is then visualized by an enzyme-conjugated anti-immunoglobulin. the enzyme-substrate reaction is finally performed by pouring a substrate-containing gel over the polystyrene surface. in this study with bovine serum albumin as antigen and a corresponding rabbit antiserum, the diffusion time of antiserum was shown to be the most critical variable of the method, while the antigen concentration used for coating, the conjugate binding time and the enzyme-substrate reaction time had a minor influence on the quantitation of antibodies. high antibody levels were measured with greater accuracy than low levels, but the standard deviation was below 10%. it was also shown that different sera containing antibodies to salmonella typhi o lps, klebsiella pneumoniae k1 and o4 lps, escherichia coli o2  lps, yersinia enterocolitica y3 lps, cardiolipin and pneumococcus could be quantitated with the same accuracy.

TI  == [characteristics and function of enterotoxins of gram negative bacteria (author's transl)].
AB  == several factors are important for the pathogenesis of bacterial intestinal disease: 1. colonisation of the intestine; 2. exo(= entero)toxin production without penetration into the intestinal wall; 3. invasion of the intestinal wall  with or without (?) simultaneous formation of enterotoxin. these factors are of different importance for the various infective agents. whereas cholera is exclusively caused by an enterotoxin, this is of minor importance for the pathogenesis of shigella dysentery. the enterotoxins of vibrio cholerae, escherichia coli, and shigella dysenteriae 1 have been intensively studied. additional enterotoxic substances have been demonstrated in other gramnegative organisms (salmonella typhimurium, yersinia enterocolitica, klebsiella pneumoniae, vibrio parahaemolyticus, aeromonas hydrophila), which, however, are not yet characterized sufficiently. future studies will aim to the elucidation of the structure and function of these toxins on the molecular level, and their importance for the pathogenesis of intestinal disease.

TI  == common enterobacterial antigen in yersinia enterocolitica.
AB  == production of the common enterobacterial antigen (ca) by strains of yersinia enterocolitica (y.e.) serotypes 3 and 9 (winblad), by strains of 5 different y.e. serogroups (wauters) and various other bacteria was examined. antibody against ca was raised by immunization of rabbits with e. coli o 14. extract prepared from s. typhimurium was used for the sensitization of sheep erythrocytes with ca. absorption and haemagglutination inhibition experiments showed that ca could be detected in heat extracts from all y.e. strains examined, and in that from yersinia pseudotuberculosis. ca was not detected in extracts from pasteurella multocida, francisella tularensis, brucella abortus, acinetobacter calcoaceticus  or pseudomonas aeruginosa. anti-ca antibodies could not be demonstrated in serum  from rabbits immunized with y.e. bacteria, but were demonstrated in serum from rabbits immunized with a ca-containing fraction of the y.e. extract. the possibility of participation of anti-ca antibody in indirect haemagglutination tests for detection of antibody to y.e. o antigens is emphasized.

TI  == restriction of dna in yersinia enterocolitica detected by recipient ability for a derepressed r factor from escherichia coli.
AB  == a derepressed r factor, ry2drd2, was transferred at a frequency of 5x10minus 3 between two strains of yersinia enterocolitica mated on a membrane. under the same conditions transfer of this r factor from escherichia coli to y. enterocolitica was observed at a frequency of only 7-7x10minus 6. this frequency  was greatly increased when the recipient strain was heat-treated before mating. heat exposure for optimum fertility was 50 to 52 degrees c for a period of 2 to 3 min. mutants of y. enterocolitica were isolated which were infected by ry2drd2 from e. coli or from y. enterocolitica at the same frequency. these observations  strongly suggest that a dna restriction and modification system in y. enterocolitica causes its low recipient ability for plasmids from other species.

TI  == [bacteriocinogeny in yersinia enterocolitica].
AB  == bacteriocinogeny was found in 19.8 per cent of y. enterocolitica strains tested.  it was designated by the authors as enterocoliticacinogeny and the substance produced by the pathogen was named enterocoliticacine. bacteriocinogeny was found among the collection strains isolated in the south primorye and not among the strains isolated abroad. some cultures of y. enterocolitica isolated abroad and in the south primorye were used as indicator strains for revealing enterocoliticacinogeny. enterocoliticacine inhibited growth only of some strains  of y. enterocolitica and had no inhibitory effect on growth of coli bacteria, plague and pseudotuberculosis microbes. the latter 3 bacterial species did not inhibit growth of the causative agent of gastric yearsiniosis, which may be of some diagnostic importance. the diverse spectrum of enterocoliticacine and the character of inhibition of sensitive culture growth are indicative of the presence of several types of bacteriocines in y. enterocolitica.

TI  == properties of r factors from bordetella bronchiseptica.
AB  == genetic properties and host ranges of r factors derived from bordetella bronchiseptica of pig origin were examined. all of 61 r factors tested could confer resistance to streptomycin, sulfonamide, and aminobenzyl penicillin on their host bacteria. all of them were identified as fi(-) (no fertility inhibition) type and were found to exhibit no restriction of phages lambda, phi80, p1, p2, t1, t3, t6, t7, w31, and bf-23. they could confer macarbomysin susceptibility on their host cells when infected. an rte16, a representative r factor, was incompatible with both rp4 and r40a, which are classified as compatibility groups p and c, respectively. an rte16 was conjugally transmissible to b. bronchiseptica, escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii, salmonella typhimurium, and yersinia enterocolitica, but not to shigella flexneri, s. sonnei, proteus mirabilis, p. vulgaris, p. rettgeri, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa.

TI  == specificity, induction, and absorption of pesticin.
AB  == irradiation of pesticinogenic (pst(+)) cells of yersinia pestis with ultraviolet  light resulted in a five- to eightfold increase in titer of intracellular pesticin. extracellular activity in irradiated or control cultures never approached that found within the bacteria. upon chromatography of crude extracts  of pst(+) cells on columns of diethylaminoethyl-cellulose, sephadex g200, and calcium hydroxyapatite, fractions were recovered which inhibited the growth of indicator cells of escherichia coli, y. pseudotuberculosis, y. enterocolitica, and pst(-)y. pestis. by means of these methods, in conjuntion with fractional precipitation with ammonium sulfate, the antibacterial activity was purified to homogeneity (as judged by disc gel electrophoresis and analysis by double diffusion in agar). the relative sensitivity of each cell type was constant and not affected by the state of purification. these findings indicate that the pesticin molecule alone accounts for lethality. cells of e. coli and y. pseudotuberculosis were about 100 and 10 times more sensitive to pesticin, respectively, than were those of pst(-)y. pestis. activity directed against sensitive cells of these three species was enhanced by 0.1% ethylenediaminetetraacetate (edta) and completely inhibited by 0.01 m hemin or 0.001 m fe(3+). the response of y. enterocolitica to pesticin was variable in the presence of edta and was not influenced by fe(3+). attempts to detect common surface structures responsible for absorption of pesticin by the four cell types  were not successful.

TI  == gene transfer in pasteurella pestis harboring the f'cm plasmid of escherichia coli.
AB  == a strain of pasteurella pestis, harboring the f'cm plasmid from escherichia coli, was able to donate its chromosome to auxotrophic recipient strains of p. pestis.  the frequency of gene transfer in p. pestis was approximately 10(-6) per donor cell, 100 times less efficient than gene transfer in pasteurella pseudotuberculosis, but efficient enough to determine entry times for the markers histidine, threonine, and tryptophan and to show linkage to the markers arginine  and pigmentation. an attempt to extend the conjugation system to different serotypes of p. pseudotuberculosis and to yersinia enterocolitica did not succeed.
